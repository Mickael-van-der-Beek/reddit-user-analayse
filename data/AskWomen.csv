I was walking down the street on the way to work today and almost forgot about my ""master plan"" you all helped me with.  So I took out a business card - wrote my cell number on the front and on the back thought that since I was reverting to middle school flirting I would try and be a bit cute with it.  



So I wrote ""Will you go out with me? 

* Coffee (with a check box); 
* Lunch (checkbox); 
* No thanks, find a new way to walk to work



Saw her right around our usual place, got a smile and as we got closer gave her the ""1 second"" finger, she slows down and as we approach I take one ear of my headphones out, she does the same and I hand her the card ""coffee-side"" up and said ""let me know tomorrow"".  



She was understandably a little thrown off, so I smiled and just said, ""hope to hear from you"".


I had resigned myself to the full day waiting game but I just got back from a meeting and had a voicemail on my work phone.  



""Hi, this is _____, the girl you handed the cutest note in the world to today.  After I read it I actually said, 'I'll do either' but you were already too far away.  I wanted to give you your note back tomorrrow but feel bad making you wait for the answer, so lets talk soon and find a place for drinks after work"" and then left her number.




So score.  Thanks again for the advice and with a meeting story like this, I hope something substantial comes out of it.  

+++++ **UPDATE 2** +++++

Went out for a drink last night and we had an amazing time, I'm so glad I went for it.  We had a few drinks, some appetizers and a bunch of laughs.  Had a great non-awkward goodnight and shared a ton of texts afterwards.  On the walk to work today, I came around the corner to a big smile, and was a bit unsure of the protocol, do we both stop, slow dow, etc.   

She made it easy, I met her on my side of the street with a big smile, she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and said I looked nice and then ""have a good day at work"" with a wink and walked away.  While walking away I get a text that says ""How proud of me are you that I didn't make-out with you on the sidewalk :)""

[Original]http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14vfku/reddit_women_unmarried_man37_will_be_having_his/

First I want to thank people for their advice on the original thread.  A lot of it was very helpful and it was a self confidence boost to know I was on the right track.  Thanks!

I've never been a particularly emotional guy.  Surely, I know the feeling of love  and I know the joy of a hug from my niece but 6 months ago if someone had told me I'd cry tears in happiness I would have thought them crazy.  As I waited near the baggage claim I had the worst case of butterflies in my entire life.  A first/second date didn't even compare with the turmoil I had going on and as I waited I was able to occupy my mind with every horrible scenario possible for Liz's visit.  Meeting Liz I was greeted with a full on tight hug which, right off the bat, started kicking my emotional butt but then she quickly followed that with a ""I'm so happy to finally get to  hug my Dad.""  It took every ounce of fake man cough I could muster to hold the tears at bay.  I start with this because it pretty much embodies her entire visit.  Between our initial meeting and her departure I had to use the fake cough, clearing of throat or sudden bathroom visit on more than a handful of occasions.  

We did a lot of fun things during her visit.  Went skiing, ice skating, saw a Broadway show.  Lots of firsts for her since she's only lived in a much warmer climate.  I'm glad I was warned about giving her personal time/space.  She wanted her alone time and I probably would have been either worried or annoyed had I not mentally prepared myself ahead of time.  We share a common interest in science and wanted to see where I worked so we spent a day doing that.  I know the parents out there will think ""Well no duhh"" but while visiting my work Liz showed a sincere understanding of a few concepts and I felt such an overwhelming feeling of pride.  I was completely taken off guard by it! 

""I love you"" was finally said the night before her flight home.  Throughout the visit I danced around it a bit to see her reaction but I refused to have her leave without hearing the words.  That evening, as we were scanning in photos I had saved from before I left, I told her about how on several occasions I almost threw these away but could never do it.  The box followed this unsentimental guy through years of grad school, medical school and several moves between different states after that.  More than once I placed it into the garbage only to go and dig it out later because I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to our story together.  I took the opportunity to explain to her how I have a 5 year relationship with her in my memory that she doesn't equally share and because of this I need to tell her that I loved her.  I loved her then and I love her now.   As we sat in silence the moments following and I considered how a better man than myself would not have walked away, regardless of what a stupid DNA test said, I noticed her holding back the tears this time.  

So where does it go from here?  We've decided we're going to see each other monthly even though it's a bit of flying to accomplish it.  She also wants to spend spring break and summer vacation with me and I'm quite excited about it.   After an 11 year gap I'm a Dad again and I love it.

It gave me so much confidence, I've walked around with my head held high these past few weeks. And well, when I met a guy I liked, I just said, *what the hell*, and asked him out. And he said yes!! Now we are together and I am so happy I could fly.

...Thank you so, so much for your all your kindess, thoughtfulness, sweet words and funny stories!

I did not expect that many responses, not at all. 

I want you to know that it really did help, hearing your lovely encouragement and receiving so much support. 

I have not gotten a chance to reply to all of your comments, their were just so many :), but please know, that each and every contribution, was like a hug from each of you.

Thank you very, very much! :)

I hope you all had a lovely weekend :)

And before I post this, I would like to take a moment to make a combination of an Oscar acceptance speech, a letter to my possible future child, a eulogy and something akin to Travis Birkenstock's Most Tardys in the class honors acceptance speech from Clueless: 

I would like to thank Midol-with a special shout out to their Teen formula, for all these years you got me through some of the worst cramps and I would have been in a helluva alot more pain and been hell to put up with, if it weren't for you. I'd like to thank Whole Foods, for making the best organic tampons, they were never uncomfortable and they never let me down. 

I'd also like to thank Instead Softcup, 12 Hour protection. You allowed me to have some really awesome sex on my period, without the mess and not even my boyfriend at the time could tell I was on my period or that you were allowing us to have a rockin time in the sack-thanks for keeping that just between us :).

To my ovaries, thanks for being able to stick around, so I'll still want to have rockin sex :)! 

To the men at my favorite burger joint, you have NO IDEA what a lifesaver your bacon cheeseburger was every month and when you started putting rootbeer floats on the menu, I thought I'd just about died and gone to heaven!


To my uterus, cervix and goddamm fallopian tubes. Please know, that although I am disappointed, I know it's not personal. I know you didn't fail on me, on purpose. We're just not a good fit anymore it seems and it's better for all of us, to just part ways. I appreciate you trying all these years, for us to make a go of it but it seems, my body and I will be in much better harmony without you. Sometimes their's nothing to do anymore but to say goodbye. 

And last but not least, To my future child, should I be so lucky: If I am not your biological mother, I hope you don't care, I hope so very much, that I am enough. If you ever want to go to seek out your biological mother, I can't deny that a part of me wouldn't be hurt but I would still, absolutely support you. I can only empathize what it must be like but I can imagine it's only natural to be curious and have questions that you would want your biological parents to answer. I want you to know though, that whether we look alike or not, I don't give a damm. Whether people can tell or not that we're not biologically related or not, I don't give a damm. I'll do my best to be the best mum I can be and to me, that means giving you unconditional love, making sure you know how loved you are and helping you become who you want to be. I won't ever encourage you to be anyone but you. Even if that makes you the class ""weirdo"" or if you're the most ""regular"" child ever. Whoever you are is who I want you to be. And even though I haven't even meant you and even though I don't know you, I love you already. I'll find you. I believe that if any good is to come out of not being able to have biological children, it's this one thing but it's the only one that matters; that I was meant to find you in this world, not inside my stomach.

I am a bit of a mentor to a lady who is in her early 20s at work. She is pretty but also has a sharp wit, has an interesting background and is extremely positive and friendly to everyone she meets.

I was out at after work drinks with a few of her peers (about 10 years younger than me) and they all ended up quite a bit more drunk than me. She came up in conversation and there was a general consensus amongst the guys that she was a flirt, cock tease, user etc. I was pretty shocked that the had this opinion. I made a mild attempt to defend her but realized it was a wasted pursuit and changed the topic.

I have been thinking about it all weekend and the more i think about it the worse i feel for women. Especially pretty single ones. It seems as a pretty single woman you either stay aloof and risk getting called 'stuck up', or you are nice and a bunch of guys will take your niceness the wrong way and then call you a cock tease or flirt when their advances are rejected.

I'm a slight germaphobe as it is and there are times when I don't want to take this money, it's so rude and disturbing to me.

So i went on a trip to Europe with a college tour company. It was a group tour, so it was about 30 people ranging from 19 to 26 years old. The way it worked out was that it was 5 guys and 25 girls. Two of the guys were with their girlfriends, and the other two were doing their own thing most of the time, so i ended up hanging out with these girls quite often. My sister came along in this trip with me, and that helped to build a certain kind of trust since someone was 'vouching' for me, so we all ended up getting to know each other pretty well.

Here's what im getting at. I'm 22, 6' tall, broad shouldered and i look stern whenever i dont know people (once they get to know me, they realize im wicked mellow), so my 5 foot-nothing older sister often uses me to fend off creeps, and i gladdly do it. However, i often found myself in the situation where i was looking over 20+ rather atractive girls and fending off dudes that the girls felt creeped out by. Fuckin' A, the trip was a nice little learning experience about rape culture. What. The. Flying. Fuck.

The episode that drove it home was in France. We were drinking in the hotel bar and one of the girls got a craving for cookies. I offered to go with her since it was like 1:30am. The whole time we were out on the empty parisian streets, she kept looking over her shoulder. I tried to mellow out tbe situation by talking and joking around, and while she went along with it, she was still very vigillant and still uneasy until we got back to the hotel.

Women should not have to feel like this. Its fucking bullshit and it makes me angry, but it also makes me very self-aware of some things that might make girls uncomfortable. I guess what im trying to get at is, as a male, im sorry this is something you girls have to deal with constantly.

I sincerely appreciate everyone taking the time to respond. You have a wonderful community here with loving and caring people! You are very lucky! I can't respond personally to everyone but will make a generic reply so that everyone knows how thankful I am!**

Thanks in advance for any help.

My 13 year old daughter and I had a discussion the other day about weight. She is now about 5'7"" tall and weighs about 135 lbs. I told her that this is a very good weight for her as she is in GREAT physical shape with a lot of muscle from sports. I showed her graphs for optimal BMI, I explained how muscle weighs more than fat, I told her that our current image of women in media is unhealthy, etc..etc...

Because her mom is 5'7"" and 115 lbs AND because her mom could NEVER stand to be fat my daughter feels she is fat. No matter what I tell her.

My daughter will probably end up to be around 5'10"" or so and I'm sure her weight will be much higher than now.

Is there anything I can say or do that will convince my daughter that she is a perfect specimen for a human woman? She is strong, fast, intelligent and so much more. I tell her these things all the time. Not only that, but I listen for HOURS every week as she tells me her dreams, ideas, dislikes, and fears. I've always told her she can come and talk to me about anything. But on this topic (weight) it seems I have no influence.

Any and all input is much appreciated.

Nothing terribly special was just at my house and I told her I was going to go take a shower (which I did) but then I put on a suit.  I came out into the living room and she looked at me with surprise and asked ""why do you have a suit on?""  I replied ""You wear suits for special occasions right?""  she said ""yes, but this isn't a special occasion""  I then knelt down on one knee and said ""it is now"" and proposed.

Because of my disability, I never had the confidence to do this in the past, except for a few times. It's not that I have social anxiety per se. I've just always found it hard to break through that whole dating circuit thing.

Anyway, one of the main barriers I find to asking someone out is that I'm more afraid that the askee will say ""Yes"" instead of saying ""No"" and that this ""Yes"" will be said out of pity more than anything else. Backwards, I know. 

I've experienced this a few times before, where I'll ask an acquaintance on a date and she sort of winces and says ""Sure"". Then, either she ends up flaking out or I do because I can take a hint. I don't really want to go through a bunch of those again. 

I'm a big fan of communication. I *really* value honesty and authenticity, maybe even more than your average bear. And I'm tired of protecting others from protecting me, if that makes sense. I wish things weren't so awkward for me in these situations, especially since I'm not a particularly awkward person. I would like actual social feedback.

Is there a special way of asking women out that I can employ so that they don't feel so obligated to say ""Yes""? Can I start things off with the disclaimer that she can totally say no, or is that too self-deprecating and unattractive? Am I sort of ""doomed"" to make things awkward because of my disability?

I intercepted it as best I could but he is stronger than me and he ended up stabbing me twice instead. This was about 6 months ago and unfortunately we broke up about a month later because she felt responsible and I couldn't convince her otherwise.

He stabbed me in the stomach and dragged the knife up about 4 inches, so there is a huge 5 inch scar on one side of I guess my abs. He also got me in The back of my right shoulder and dragged down another 3 inches or so before the police got him.

I won't lie and say it doesnt bother me, I haven't taken my shirt off since and I guess I've been kind of bummed since it ended so my self esteem has taken a bit of a hit, which probably adds to it. Either way, I'm feeling very self-conscious about it and I'd like to know how you would feel about this sort of thing.

So, what do you think about scars? Specifically bad scars?

It started when I invited her to go see *Skyfall* after I saw her post on Facebook about wanting to go to the movies. We saw it, enjoyed it, shot the shit and I drove her back home. 

About two days later, she asks me if I can help her go to a party (she doesn't have a car) and that I was invited. So I picked her up and drove her, which was about an hour and a half of just talking. I had to take her back to her place the next day and I was invited into her parents house to have dinner &amp; we ended up talking on the balcony.

This may sound as if I like this girl right? No, not at all. It's actually surprising. I don't think of her in any romantic way and not in a sexual way. I mean she's attractive but I just see her as a friend. This is not what her friends or my friends think.

After hanging out alone for a while, all her friends seem to think I'm doing this just to get in her pants. They think that just because I randomly decided to hang out with her, that it's all a part of some mischievous plot. I'm not sure if this is some common thought process that some women have to protect their friends but do any of you think the same way?

I'm just fearful that they may try and stop me from hanging out with her, despite me saying that I have no romantic or sexual motives. She's a cool girl and she's the only person who's really gotten me outside of my apartment in the last couple of weeks, so I'm hoping this doesn't cause anything to happen.

Is there any way to keep this from me feel like they want my money?",throwawayn829,532,119,340,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/17oy1j/as_a_guy_with_a_pretty_good_job_ive_noticed_women/,"I've noticed this a lot, actually.   If/when I tell women I'm a surgeon (which has to get brought up inevitably) I notice a drastic, positive change in the way they react to me to the point of some becoming downright promiscuous in comparison to how they acted before.  I notice almost all the girls I meet outside of work friends upon finding out my profession will start giving me a lot more contact, smiling more, and just being more flirty with me in general.  Also, if I'm being honest they're a lot more open to the idea of a one-night stand.

So far the best thing I've found is to let them know how much it bothers me and to downplay it.  But even then usually their friend will say something like, ""Oh, is this the doctor you were telling me about?""  And I'm thinking, ""Why even mention my job?""

Honestly using my job can be fun if I just want to hook up.  But when I'm looking for someone I might something more with, it sucks.  All of this change in reaction just by hearing what job I have makes me feel like they're not turned on by me but my income.  I love my career and I have no regrets about what profession I chose, but it's not who I am, and it doesn't automatically make me a sexier person.

Sorry for the rant.  It's 7 a.m. and I still haven't been asleep.  Just had an issue last night where a girl I was talking to got upset that I didn't pay for her drink (she was drunk, but she said, ""Please?  You make *way* more money than I do."")  It just depressed me.  Like it's not who I am, it's what I can do for them.

**Edit:**  Just wanted to say thanks for all the answers.  I'm going to be ridiculously busy for the next few weeks but I'll try and read all these responses in time.  It's nice to hear some rational perspective on everything.  Ultimately I've found money makes me somewhat paranoid and that's a lot of it.  I know I just have to take a leap of faith and hope the girl I meet genuinely likes my weird personality and not just who I am on paper.  I will say this: anyone who thinks life just becomes easier when you make money is dead wrong.  Also I can tell you this; just because someone is a physician doesn't mean he has everything figured out.  I get that a lot as if I'm supposed to be unflappably confident in all facets of my life.  I feel like a boss inside the hospital, but outside I'm just a guy.  I wish others could see that, though. But honestly when I tell a girl I'm ""just a guy outside the hospital,"" I almost get a sense like I just took the wind out of their sails.  But I'll just have to deal with that.

Bonding suggestions?",incoming12yearold,431,62,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14vfku/reddit_women_unmarried_man37_will_be_having_his/,"The Story...

At 5 years old I met my future ex-gf... At 16 we started dating and it lasted until I was almost 20.  Once we reached college we broke up as we went to different schools and it was an on again / off again relationship but we supposedly stayed faithful throughout... Supposedly.  I found out from her roommate that she was sleeping around and I decided to end it there... As luck my have it, just before breaking up my ex-gf became pregnant due to a condom breaking.  

I could write a small novel on this part of my life.   How I wasn't sure it was mine because I now knew she was sleeping with others.  She wasn't a horrible person for doing that, we weren't exclusive, we were ""on break"" and wanted to be able to date other people but I thought sexually we were still a couple.. anyway.. I digress... I went back and forth on staying with her and leaving.  Fact is.. We ended our romantic relationship entirely and just went back to being friends.  She was, after all, the girl I grew up with all those years and I still cared about her well being.  

So not knowing if her daughter was mine or not (but assuming she was) I stayed in close contact with my ex-gf and acted as though the baby was mine.  I was supportive through the birth, supportive financially (the best I could be back then) and was around a lot.  My name was on her birth certificate even.  This continued for 5 years and by this time I was extremely bonded to our daughter.  About this time my ex-gf meets another guy (we were not romantic so I didn't care) and tells me that her daughter was not mine, there was no way she could be mine.  I was pretty upset, distraught, hurt, and insisted on a paternity test.  The ex-gf agreed.   We did some research and had a paternity test sent in the mail... Now mind you this was back when mail order paternity tests was a pretty new concept.  It cost around $400 at the time and, as you will later find out, were not always done in a very controlled fashion apparently.  The DNA test returns 2 months later that I was not her father.  My ex-gf moves to have my name removed from the birth certificate and has a new one issued.  I left their lives that week and just tried to move on.  

Now at 37, unmarried, no other kids, you can see I didn't do such a great job at moving on.  I always felt like I left someone behind back there.  To say I was haunted by that young girls face would be an understatement.  I moved into a big city and I do pretty well for myself.  I haven't met anyone and got married because I just haven't met the right person.  I'm sure trust issues from the past come into play here.  Overall, though, I'm a well balanced guy with a great career and plenty of hobbies and FWB.  I know the FWB thing just makes me sound like a slimeball but I don't believe I am.  I hope I'm not.

2 months ago I get a call from a lawyer asking if I knew my ex-gf and her daughter.  He informed me that my ex-gf was killed in a car accident 2 years ago and reveals that I am, in fact, most likely my ex-gf's daughter's father.  I honestly about dropped the phone because for all these years I strongly felt that she was my daughter.  When I left them at 5 years old I felt the resemblance was so incredibly strong I had no idea how she couldn't be mine.  Who was I to argue with a DNA test?   I explained to the lawyer about the DNA test and he, in turn, explains that her aunt (ex-gf's sister) was party to tampering with the first paternity test.  He suggests getting a lawyer of my own and getting another DNA test.  I get a lawyer and another DNA paternity test, this time under medical supervision.  My daughter, we'll call her Liz (not her real name), in her city half way across the country and me in mine.  Not wanting to be further manipulated it's done with lawyers involved and at a hospital.  The results come back.. Positive! I am her father.  (What the hell I'm about to cry just typing this).

Anyway.. Liz and I talk on the phone and skype and she's such a sweet amazing young woman.  In 2 weeks she's going to come visit me for Christmas vacation and I was sure to take the entire time off of work.  I want our time together to go extremely well but I'm here for some advice.

#1)  I haven't broached the subject that when I left Liz I was under impression that she was not my daughter.  That this impression wasn't just a whim it was written on what I thought was an accurate medical document.  I would have never left her if I had known.  *fucking tears again?*  I think Liz knows some of this, some of the background story, but I don't know how much.  Her Aunt (ex-gf's sister) is the one who is taking care of Liz and I doubt she went ahead and told Liz the entire story.  Also talking about this brings to point that her mom, whom I'm sure she loves, manipulated and lied.  I'm fearful of ending up in that discussion but it's so important to me that Liz knows I didn't abandon her and her mother.   So I've been thinking about writing a detailed letter and completely leaving out any mention of her mother manipulating the test.. instead just say the fact that the test came back negative and give no explanation as to why or how.  Just leave it at that.  I won't mention that her aunt and mother tampered with the test and just shrug off any questions as to how the test came back negative.  

How bad of an idea is this?  Essentially lying to her upon our first chance to bond together again?  I hate the thought but how can I drag her mom and aunt's name through the mud like that?  I just don't know what to do about this.

#2)  At 16 what are some of the best things you can remember doing with your father?   I keep racking my brain on what to plan with her but all I come up with is ideas that I take dates on.   Stuff like ballet and theater.  Skiing and ice skating.  Cooking dinner together.   I come up with some great idea and it sounds more like a date than it does a father daughter thing.  How far off am I here?  I don't want to creep her out.

#3)  I've been biting my tongue on the ""I love you"" phrase..  Even though I do.  I spent the first 5 years of her life caring for her and having her sleep at my place.  She says she has very little recollection of that time but remembers some.  I left their life on that day but I kid you not when I say she stayed with me all those years.  In hindsight I wish I had stuck around regardless and been involved but I thought I was doing the right thing, letting the ex move on with her life and I move on with mine.   I love her but I'm afraid to freak her out and say that.  Thoughts?  Wait for her to say it?

#4)  If you were in her shoes, remember she's 16, what one thing could I do to make you feel loved and cared for?  

OK.. sorry for the small novel.  I appreciate your sincere responses as I'm really just trying to make this all work well for us.   I know from being a redditor a lot of ""ask"" type questions are more just ""read my story and comment"" posts but I'm really reaching out for a little advice here.

I had a lot of shit going on these past few days. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/11kf0g/i_think_my_girlfriend_cheated_do_you_consider/) the original post. 



So, this is my update. Here's what went down, when my girlfriend came home from work:




I was sitting on the couch, she came home and said 'Hi baby!'. I got up from the couch, went into the hallway and looked her in the eyes. I told her that we had to talk. Now Im not gonna write out the whole conversation, because I dont remember everything, but Im gonna write a summary:




I told her that I snooped through her phone, and that I knew it was wrong, she didnt really react at that point, her eyes just got wider (she knew that I had discovered something she was hiding).




I told her I saw all the messages between her and the guy and that I was really disappointed in her. I told her that I never wouldve expected that of her. She got teary eyed and then started crying like I never saw her cry before. She was a wreck, she cried so much, and then... I dont know why, but I hated to see the woman I love cry.. I hugged her. I just hugged her and I dont even know why. I was pissed, I was mad, but when she started crying, I broke down as well. I hugged her. Can anyone relate to this? Eventhough she did somethign very wrong, I still felt empathy for her... no idea why.




After she calmed down, we sat down on the couch, I told her that I cant be with someone that cheats on me, no matter whether it was in real life or online. She started crying again. I told her we could talk about this after both of us have calmed down, but now I just needed to get away from her. I packed my stuff and left the apartment. She was sobbing at that point, but I knew I had done the right thing. I went to my best friend's house and stayed there for 3 days. I have gotten countless texts from her, but I have ignored them so far. I am moving into a new apartment on November first. I still love and miss her, but I know that breaking up with her was for the best. I just cant be with a girl who sends nude pictures of her to some random guy.




Whats funny though, is that the guy messaged me a few days after the incident, asking how it went and whether Im alright. I like this guy more and more. I cant explain why, but he just seems like a guy who liked a girl and acted on it. I cant really blame him. I just admire that he contacted me later on, asking me how I was doing. He seems like a good person.

Help me gain some insight.",penguinsheep,444,96,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/13uk3h/update_im_not_comfortable_with_the_idea_of_a/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/13r2b5/im_not_comfortable_with_the_idea_of_a_woman_whos/) if anybody's interested. I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I've narrowed it down to what was really bothering me. I grew up in a religious, conservative country. This implanted a lot of ideas in my head concerning sexuality (which I will discuss below.) While my parents were very liberal in context, they were very conservative when it came to certain subjects (sexuality included.) While my parents themselves didn't put any of these ideas in my head, the overall culture and religion definitely did.

So what were these ""ideas""?

*1- Women should be kept ""pure"" by keeping their virginity until marriage.*

This one was huge. I remember as a teenager I was adamant about marrying a virgin. I looked down upon girls who had any sort of sex, as did my entire peer group. Interestingly, I had no such views towards guys who had sex, and actually envied them. The double standard is glaringly obvious, but for some reason, I never noticed it.

*2- Women don't enjoy sex as much as men.*

I have no idea where this one came from, but I used to think that men were the only ones after sex, and that women sort of obliged but didn't really enjoy it. Now that I think of it, as a teenager, I assumed none of the girls in my class ever got horny, which now seems ridiculous.

*3- I held extreme double standards that I never noticed. Once I realized them, it was easy to let go.*

After reading through the comments yesterday, I asked myself this question. What if I re-read my original post and substituted ""man"" for ""woman""? The results were obvious. I had no problem with men who slept around with many women because they were just having fun. I mean what guy wouldn't want to have sex with multiple women? So why I was ok with promiscuous men but not promiscuous women? I'm not entirely sure, but it must have been something I picked up from religion/culture.

Once I realized the double standards, everything made sense. I was in a state of cognitive dissonance, and that's what was bothering me. Thanks to everyone who helped me gain some perspective.

My girlfriend left for work 2 hours ago, I'm at home, it's my day off. She forgot her phone, me being the idiot I am, I decided to look through it (I know, very wrong of me). This is the first time I've done it, and she was always an innocent angel, I was just hoping to get some confirmation on that 'fact.




Boy was I wrong. This old friend of hers [m/22] (who moved to a different country a while ago) had exchanged a couple of messages with her. Some of them caught my eye. 



a bit before his birthday she wrote 'Maybe I'm gonna send you one or two birthday pics, if you behave ;)'. The smiley is what made me suspicious. Then after his birthday 'I sure spoiled you with that many pics at once ;)'




a bit before her birthday 'I wish you were there, to jump out of a giant cake.. :)'




and she frequently calls him honey, darling, and so on.


Now, do you think she sent him nudes? I went through her e-mail folder, Whatsapp folder, nothing. Why would she delete the messages, if they were just normal pics? Furthermore, why would she send him normal, fully clothed pics, if her facebook is already full of them?

I'm so pissed. Ive never been cheated on before. I'm an attractive guy, with a well paying job. 




I've been with her for 2 and a half years now, we even live together. Fuck, can someone tell me what to do? I left the apartment, I'm just sitting here at starbucks and could just start crying.



If we break up, I cant afford the apartment anymore, I might even get fired, because her dad is my boss. Fuck everything, can anyone give me advice on what to do?



Would you break up with your SO over something like this? He moved to a different country before her and I got together, so if they ever had sex, it doesnt concern me, because it definitely wasnt during our relationship. She denies ever having sex with anyone but me and her only other boyfriend, do you believe that? Do you think they had sex?




I'm thinking about forgiving her, just for the sake of the apartment and my job, but it'll always bother me. Fuck fuck fuck.




Thanks for any and all answers.





**EDIT: I used to have a bit of a drinking problem, but I'm 2 weeks clean, and I'm so close to just go out and buy a bottle of booze again. Fuck fuck fuck. I need to do something to distract myself. Does anyone want an update later tonight / tomorrow? Should I post it here or make a new thread?**



**Update**: The dude just replied. He said they were two pictures of her in lingerie (pics she took for me, while I was gone for 2 weeks) and the whole flirting has been going on for 1 1/2 years. He apologized, said he would stop. I asked him to never tell my gf we had the conversation, he agreed and yeah... dont know what to take from it.





**Update 2**: My girlfriend will be home in less than an hour. Im signing off now. I'll make sure to post an update later tonight or tomorrow. I'll post it here, in this subreddit and I'll link to it in this post. Thanks for your support. I would never have expected so many responses. I promise I'll stay calm and not scream or throw a fit.

I (22, F) have a number of female friends who are ridiculously gorgeous. I'm not hideous, I'm at an average weight and my face looks alright from some angles. I would say I am a 6 and they are all 9s and 10s. I'm always overshadowed when men are around. I've never been singled out and hit on. Whenever we are meeting new men, no matter what setting, they are always initially interested in someone else. Even when I meet a male friend and introduce him to my friends, most of the time he will wind up hitting on one of them and trying to get me to be some sort of middle man and hook them up with each other.

I understand that the advice most people will give me is to work on being a friendlier, funnier person and someone might like me for that. This is obviously good advice but I've found that no matter how on top of my game I might be on any particular day, in early stages of meeting men they will almost always go for the prettier girl first, even if she is awkward and shy (as some of my friends are). 

I'm not aiming to be some sort of femme fatale. I've recently broken up with a long term boyfriend (one who I met in odd circumstances, can't hope to recreate that) and would like to start dating men casually. I've tried online dating and it did not work for me. 

Have any of you ladies been in this situation? What can I do? Any tips on how to not get constantly overshadowed by friends who look like Kim Kardashian and Adriana Lima (seriously). I'd really appreciate any kind of help.

TLDR: Constantly overshadowed by my ridiculously attractive female friends. I am average looking. What do i do?

Recently i've been thinking a lot about consent. I grew up in a culture where consent is incredibly important. Sex education in school, in media, in my social group; establishing consent to sex is important.

In every relationship i've had, from a one-night stand to casual hook-ups, or long term relationships, i've always established verbal consent before proceeding with sexual acts. Mainly because i don't want either myself or the person i'm engaging with life to be ruined by a lack or misunderstood communication, misreading of body language or lack of verbal affirmation. 

This usually manifests in me asking, ""Are you sure?"", ""Do you want to continue?"". It might not be smooth. But i'm not taking any risks. I'm not a mind reader. 

Besides, the saying is that 'enthusiastic consent is sexy'. So, mostly i get a raised eyebrow and a look that says ""not sure if stupid or..."" followed by a ""Uh..YEAH!"" reply. (I usually only do this in the beginning of a relationship before i can establish body language or get to know someone better or with one night stands)

Out of all the partners or women i've slept with, only once; one singular instance has a woman ever asked for my consent. When i was 17 or 18 and woman was in her mid 20's.

I've noticed that the attitude on reddit seems to be that joking about rape is wrong because it is insensitive to victims of rape. It seems to be that a smaller proportion of redditors (although I have not gone through and verified my general sense of things) there are those that believe that joking about rape is not appropriate because it can unintentionally send a message to people who have raped that it is acceptable, funny, or just not that big a deal.

While I personally subscribe more to the second view, I understand that the first is relevant to some survivors of rape, but (given my own experience) that dark humor has helped me to cope and process.

When I see that rape jokes are ""unacceptable"" I often feel like it's censorship by oversensitivity. By putting rules around what we're ""allowed"" to joke about, and how we're allowed to do it, that we're restricting dialogue around a prevalent issue in our society.

I hate it.  Not only does it mess with my rhythm, breathing, and gag reflex, but it triggers memories of a past sexual assault, so my emotional response might be more intense than most.

Usually it only happens once, I grab their wrist/make as much of a negative noise as I can, and they immediately stop and usually apologize.  Then I just keep going and don't bring it up.  But there have been a couple times when they either don't let up right away or try it more than once, and I have to physically struggle to stop it (sounds kind of dramatic, but I've had to use my full strength to get hands of my head before, and when you add in the triggering aspect it's really unsettling).  In those cases, I still try to keep going and just bring it up as a casual ""hey, please don't do that"" thing afterwards.

Is there a better way to handle this?

I don't like leading guys on unintentionally, and I don't like them dismissing me once they realize they're not getting in my pants.

  I've had this happen a handful of times, and it's a uncomfortable.  What suggestions do you have? Say ""my boyfriend"" in the first few seconds of meeting someone? Wear a faux engagement ring? Help!

 
 **Edit:** Oh my. I didn't expect this thread to get so large or so heated.


  First, I apologize if my wording or statements have offended you in any way.  This was not my intention.

  After reading everyone's comments, I think there are three different categories of girlfriendzoning:

  **1: The Slightly Uncomfortable, but Surmountable Girlfriendzoning**

  This is when a guy and a girl become friends, and the guy realizes he wouldn't mind a few dates with this girl.  He asks her out, girl says no thank you. Guy stays or leaves. **This is not what I am talking about.** This is completely legitimate, fine, and normal.  I've been ""friendzoned"" like this quite a few times and usually stay friends with the guy, simply because I enjoy being around him in a nonromantic fashion, although I would have also appreciated the romantic side.  

  **2: The Awful, Legitimate, Unrequited Love for your Best Friend**

  This is when a girl and a guy are good or best friends, and the guy develops strong feelings for his friend over a relatively longer period of time and a deeper, though still platonic, relationship.  He confesses his feelings and unfortunately, she does not return them, so he either grins and bears it or pulls away from the friendship to be able to actually breathe without hurting. **This is not what I'm talking about.**  I understand how awful this is; I've also been on the other side of this and fallen in love with best friends who wanted to stay just that--best friends.  I understand that it would be difficult to stay after something like this has happened, and again, this is not what I'm referring to at all.

  **3: [The Boyfriend Snuff Box Reaction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLoPXNquIxM)**

  I think /u/SunflowerSamurai_ may have been joking, but **This is exactly what I'm talking about.**

  In this situation, a guy meets a new girl he thinks is not completely awful, and immediately begins trying to flirt with her without even bothering to find out anything real or solid about her.  However, if she wises up enough to drop the boyfriend bomb (or does it unintentionally), he backs the fuck up right out of there and refuses to talk to her again.  Sometimes they even act angry that I was ""leading them on."" What I mean by treating women as ""not human,"" for this example only, of course, is when these certain men only talk to me because the only worth I have would be as a companion, not as an individual.  

  I am not saying these men are indicative of the men on AskWomen or on Reddit.  Although a few of you have called me a slut or an idiot, most of you have been thoughtful in your responses, and I appreciate them.  
  

  However, some of my friends in relationships have said they never get ""girlfriendzoned"" because they, and I quote, ""just seem taken.""  Aside from wearing a ring, I don't know how I could also give off this impression.  

  To give you some context about myself and my question: I am 19 years old, female, and going to university.  I am average or below average-looking and wear some pretty wack old lady glasses. I am also not a slut (although if I was, there would be nothing wrong with that.)  I dress modestly, and talk openly and freely about my growing level of cat lady mania (so the lack of weirdness isn't the problem, I can tell you that right now.)  However, the problem seems to stem from the fact that although I am not an extrovert; I am an introvert, but I try to be kind and courteous to everyone I meet and talk to.  I understand that this not-rudeness can be misconstrued as interest.

1360367977.0,259,self.AskWomen,185wdt,I'm a 21 year old who  physically can't have sex (details inside). How on earth would I tell a girl once I got into a relationship? With my problem I'm too humiliated and afraid to even ask a girl out. ,throwaway19121,313,54,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/185wdt/im_a_21_year_old_who_physically_cant_have_sex/,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible and condense everything important into a few paragraphs.

I’m a 21 year old guy who has a moderate case of Peyronie’s disease coupled with a severe case of premature ejaculation. For those who don’t know, Peyronie’s disease is “a connective tissue disorder involving the growth of fibrous plaques (scars) in the soft tissue of the penis in which scar tissue forms causing pain, abnormal curvature, erectile dysfunction, indentation, loss of girth and shortening.” The cause is unknown and there is no cure.

The vast majority of cases happen to older (60+ yrs) men, so when I was diagnosed with it at 18, I was first bewildered, then afraid, then depressed. I haven’t had a relationship with a single girl since.

At this point my sexual confidence is utterly shattered and at rock bottom. Despite being a good-looking guy who is otherwise very confident, I am incredibly sexually self-conscious. My premature ejaculation is about as bad as it could possibly be: with my last girlfriend four years ago, I never lasted more than 20 seconds. It's only gotten worse since then and I've had it for as long as I can remember.

I’m finally building up the courage to try to start talking to girls again, but I know that when it comes to sex I have so, so much less than the average guy to offer. So my question to you is *how on earth do I tell a girl about something like this once I get in a relationship?* How would you feel if a guy you were interested in told you that? What would you do? To me it just feels utterly humiliating and emasculating. 

The emotional suffering has been pretty horrendous, especially when I’ve had opportunities to go out with cute and kind girls that liked me and had to turn all my chances down. [This](http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF006-TAOTMWNP.gif) kind of sums up how I feel a lot of the time.

It hurts just to write this, knowing what people tell me are the best years of my life are fast fading while I’ve been suffering silently since I was 18.

Medically, I’m waiting on an appointment with a urologist to prescribe me Viagra to help deal with my weak erections due to Peyronie’s disease, but it's Canada and I'm on the waiting list till March. 
I have no idea if I can overcome (pun intended) my premature ejaculation or my Peyronie's disease, and like I have for the past three years, I've been completely avoiding relationships despite being horribly lonely. Any advice or comments would genuinely mean a lot. OK, that was longer than expected, thank you to anyone who has read this far :)

She completely trusts that I'll stay with her (great for her!), regardless of her appearance. But I want to leave her so bad sometimes, because I feel its just lie upon lie with this issue, and I don't feel she's made any progress, or even honest attempts.

The argument is that an accusation of rape alone is enough to seriously damage an individual's life. If the facts available to the public do not weigh heavily innocence, the accused will still suffer even if found not guilty. What makes headlines are tragic reports of crime, not the innocence a aforementioned rape suspect in a prior headline. 

EDIT 17HRS: Similarly (and somewhat obviously) rape victims face social backlash, especially if there is no conviction. 

To clarify, the name of the victim is sometimes legally withheld in the US, but not always (Need to file for gag orders, and such). Some newspapers and news agencies do not report the victim or accused out of their own moral policy.

**1. WHAT IS A ""NICE GUY""?**

&gt; **bash.org:**

&gt; A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.

This reasoning right here is the epitome of ""Nice Guy"" thinking.

Basically a ""Nice Guy"" is someone who wonders why if they are so nice and good to women, why they won't reciprocate (sleep with them)? The reason is: because they don't have to, and no force in the world can change that. Let's now get into the nitty-gritty of what's wrong with being a ""Nice Guy"" (hereafter referred to as an NG).

Some quotes that are helpful:

&gt; I think it's really important to distinguish between niceness and kindness. *Kindness is a real, positive, desirable trait in a romantic partner. Niceness is just the ability to be inoffensive.* Most women who don't like ""nice guys"" are perfectly affable toward kind men as a dateable group.

    
&gt; **Ionic posted:**

&gt; One of the keys to understanding the Nice Guy vs. the clueless innocent is that the Nice Guy's definition of himself as such is usually the result of repeated romantic failure and a resulting, crippling bitterness. The clueless innocents eventually bumble their way out of that stage. That's the difference. 

&gt; I don't want to make this into more than it is, but I think many men fail to grasp exactly how uncomfortable and, potentially, vulnerable a woman can feel in the face of persistent attention, flattery, and the like. 

&gt; It flies in the face of years and years of social conditioning to tell an outwardly ""nice"" man - one who has in no way technically threatened, harassed, or intimidated you - to ""get the fuck away, I'm not interested."" It's one thing to tell off the drunk who's trying to cop a feel on the subway (and even that isn't always easy). But rejecting the friend who just won't stop hanging around looking for more? It's not a simple situation.

&gt; So, many women just don't do it. Especially confident and assertive women can do it easily, but even a woman without self-esteem problems could understandably find it difficult to be ruthlessly direct in that situation. All too often, we opt for subtlety instead.

&gt; And that's where the real problem with Nice Guys comes in. A regular guy would get the hint, see it as a matter of compatibility and not take it personally, then move on to someone more likely to return his interest. A Nice Guy, on the other hand, will stick around and attempt to wear you down.  Often Nice Guys will pursue ""'hard luck' cases"" - women who are perhaps not the best-prepared to stand up for themselves. 

&gt; And in the end, if the Nice Guy doesn't get what he wants? He invents a scenario that makes his wasted effort a noble quest to overcome (what he tells himself) is his target's shitty taste in men. Because admitting that he wasted his time pushing for something that was clearly never going to happen is just plain cognitively uncomfortable. 

&gt; To sum up, the ""perfect storm"" that goes into creating a self-described Nice Guy is a mix of a sense of entitlement, a mark who is too kind and/or passive to outright reject the NG, and the NG's persistence in the face of what many other individuals would recognize as subtle signals of mark's disinclination to mate. 

* **1.1 Manipulation**

NG behaviour is manipulative. NGs basically do everything they can to 'make' someone fall for them in an underhanded way. It makes every ""nice"" act revolve around the ulterior goal of getting with 'that' girl. They do it so hard that it becomes a second nature and they're not even conscious of it.

* **1.2 Unrealistic objectification**

NG behaviour ultimately reduces women to objects. While they would vehemently deny it, NGs project all their romantic fantasies on one (or sometimes multiple, or successive) girls, which blinds them to the fact that these women are independent people. 

* **1.3 Dishonesty**

NGs are not nice for the sake of being nice. They're nice because they think they'll get something in return. Granted that many people behave that way, but the Nice Guy often has a particularly bad case of this, which sometimes even veers straight into a type of co-dependency or creates a massive entitlement complex.

* **1.4 It doesn't work**

Most women and many men can sense that you're a ""Nice Guy"", and think it's creepy. Also, it plain just doesn't work. Even if you insist on having some sort of mathematical formula for ""women like X, Y and Z so if I do that, I'll get laid"", the Nice Guy Technique has appalling success rates.

* **1.5 ""Ugh, women always end up dating douches""**

Nobody likes assholes, and any women who says she prefers ""bad boys"" past age 25 is probably sort of broken herself. *However, most women who end up with guys that have glaring flaws don't date them because of their flaws. They end up dating them/sleeping with them because they are self-confident, have interesting stuff to say, are attractive or act like actual people instead of a scripted doormat.* Also, maybe her SO is acting hostile towards you because he can sense your true motives. 

* **1.6 Passiveness**

One particular reason why the ""friendship"" between an NG and their 'one true love' or whatever is shallow and questionable is that NGs typically don't go in against their object's opinions (unless their position is threatened somehow), even if these are wrong or questionable. It's pretty passive at best and sycophantic at worst.

* **1.7 ""I am nice""**

NGs often describe themselves as being ""nice"", and oddly enough, so do many people around them. Well, if the first thing that comes up in your mind, or in others' if you need to be described, is ""nice"", then you have a problem because it means you're not particularly seen as having personality.


**2. TYPICAL NICE GUY EXCUSES**

* **2.1 ""But I am genuinely a friend.""**

If you are, then why are you moping how girls only ""want you as a friend""? Also, a variant of this excuse is NGs who go out of their way to not do anything or act on their feelings as long as their object of desire is in a relationship, but prefer pining in the shadows, bottling up massive frustrations.

* **2.2 ""But in that movie/novel...""**

Popular culture tends to feed the idea that the NG thing is somehow cute, worth empathising with or even truly romantic. Like so many clichés about love and relationships in pop culture, it couldn't be further from the truth. Pop culture loves exploiting NGs because it tugs on a few heart strings and is good for drama. It doesn't make this sort of behaviour mentally healthy or advisable, and if you're going to take dating advice from pop culture, well, then I don't know what to say.

* **2.3 ""If she doesn't like it, why doesn't she say anything about it?""**

Nice guys make an advance that cannot be rejected in a socially acceptable way. If a guy says, ""Hey, how about a date?"", then it's perfectly socially acceptable to say, ""Nah, I'm not interested."" But instead he might say, ""Oh, you're moving? I'd love to help. When? Hmm, I'm working that day, but I can call out sick. It's really no problem! I don't own a truck, but I could rent one of those ones from the Home Depot."" Is this guy really helpful just generally, or is there some subtext there of him trying to impress you? Should you say, ""That would be really helpful, but since I am not attracted to you, I am honor-bound not to accept your offer of assistance""? Of course not. So you don't say it, and then there's this weird THING sort of hanging in the air in your dealings with that person in the future. You're like 85% sure that he's into you, but every time he has an opportunity to actually say it, he passes it up. Eventually, you relax a little, and then one day one of your dumber girlfriends lets on in front of this guy that you have car trouble. You try to hiss at her or step on her foot or something, but you're too slow or she's too clueless, and his eyes brighten. ""Can I look at it? I'd be happy to help!"" Ugh.

* **2.4 ""Welp, guess I should become an asshole then!""**

Apart from being a non-argument/false dichotomy (it's not one or the other), in fact, NGs are already assholes, but with a mask of niceness. You can certainly be a nice person without the deeper layers of manipulation, self-pity and self-entitlement.

**3. HOW TO SNAP OUT OF BEING A ""NICE GUY""**

* **3.1** Realise that the world doesn't owe you anything, and by extension, women don't owe you anything merely because you're ""nice"" for all the wrong reasons.

* **3.2** Stop being a passive-aggressive doormat and be more candid about your desires. This will mean having to take rejection, too.

* **3.3** Don't pine. Realise that there are many, many potentially compatible partners that you could have while wasting time on projecting your romantic fantasies onto someone who will never reciprocate.

* **3.4** Realise that there is no ""manual"" to women, no guaranteed rules, etc. If you're autistic or have a bad case of the 'sperg, seek therapy.",,False,,t5_2rxrw,True,,male,True,t3_lncn2,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/lncn2/compiled_a_kill_nice_guy_with_fire_guide_for_men/,

What's the best way?,strykeanywhere,300,62,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1e3anq/trying_to_find_women_who_dont_care_if_a_guy_cant/,"I posted here once before about whether or not women existed who wouldn't mind being with a guy that couldn't have p/v sex, and I was surprised that a few said it was possible if everything else was right.

So now I'm wondering how to **FIND** them.  I don't want to mention how I am too soon, but the longer I wait the more time I'm wasting for both of us, because most girls don't like it when they find out.  

What's going on is **extremely** fast premature ejaculation.  Basically, anything that is exciting enough to make me hard makes me shoot before I even get completely hard, and second and third tries are even worse.  I'm completely numb for a long time, then sensation returns all at once and is so powerful I shoot while still completely limp.

I've tried everything including meds, and nothing has ever helped.  In fact, anti-depressants make the first try the same as the second try without them.  Because I'm also really small (not even on the chart for girth and in the bottom 1% for length), I've decided it's probably some sort of nerve problem related to underdevelopment.  I've asked two doctors if that could be it and they both said such things are usually seen in combination with many other physical problems I *don't* have, but isolated development problems aren't unknown.

Anyway, physical intimacy is becoming emotionally harder to even attempt, anymore, because it never ends well.  If I do say something first she never returns another call; and if I don't, after seeing my ""performance"" she leaves as soon as possible, remembers why I can't stay the night after all, etc.

So.  Where can I go from here?  The only girl who stayed after finding out how I was had a sexual thing of her own that kept her from finding a guy, and we ""traded flaws.""  It was a freak encounter, though, that probably wouldn't happen again in a thousand years.  Other than her, I've had no luck.  For a while I figured there must be girls with a fetish for zero-control, super fast guys, but if there are it's damn few.

Ideas?  After an entire life of this (just turned 30), I'm willing to try most anything.

In my mind, this is unfair to the father, who also had a role in creating the kid.

Being on the opposite side of most feminists I equate the mentality of ""the woman has a uterus so they have the sole right to abort"" to ""the woman has a uterus so they have to stay home and take care of the kids"".

But what if the father wants the unborn child, and the mother doesn't? Is it tough luck for the father?

I am not recommending an as-is denial of choice to the mother. What I am saying is that if there isn't a rape, and the father is competent enough the following should happen:

   * The mother is compensated as a surrogate as the child is no longer considered her own.
   * No child support is paid because the father has effectively adopted the child from the mother.
   * The mother is not given any custody of the child (as she wanted to abort in the first place, it is probably not an issue). If she wants custody, then she must repay the surrogate price.

Could this system work?

e1 - Just thinking out loud here, I have another can of worms to open: it is strange how a fetus is only considered a person when the woman desires to keep the child. If a man does anything to induce an abortion, that is an automatic second degree murder charge. (See the Scott Peterson trial) Shouldn't the charge be the same as causing a kidney to fail? The woman could still live without a kidney. It appears that personhood of a child is solely based on the decision of the female.

I think I need to reiterate myself to be clear, ideally abortions would take two signatures, whether it be that of the woman and a judge, a woman and an abuse councilor, a woman and her spouse.

It is very possible, and I do believe that men's rights and feminism can be apposites instead of opposites, that the goals of both sides can be worked on at the same time.

Now coupled with the fact that I’m a rather serious person (it’s something I’m working on, trying to be more jovial), I’ve been told my first impression to people, to women specifically is scary/intimidating.  But once they get to know me, I’m a giant teddy bear.   

My question is to the ladies here, how much does this work against me?  If it does, suggestions on how to appear more…welcoming?  I’m not the type of person who smiles for no reason or that can look “relaxed” on demand.  I simply cannot make my face do that, and make it look natural.  My relaxed face is what it is, and I do smile, but I can’t hold a smile after the emotion that caused it has passed. 

If this sounds too much like it goes into dating advice I do apologize.  I really am looking for a ladies opinion on how to appear more approachable.  

Edit: heh...I should mention I'm male...based on some responses, I have given the false impression that I'm a lady.  Mostly cause I'm an idiot and forgot to say I'm a dude.  My apologies.

Edit2: Lots of great advice and comments, please keep them coming!  I am reading them.  Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen! :).

Edit3: So I learned, that quite a few of you ladies are into men like myself.  But I have to approach you.  A lot of you suggested I should practice smiling more.  I'll take that under advisement, but frankly I fear the end result will be that I'll look like the victim of the Jokers laughing gas.  At any rate, I appreciate all the kinds words from you all, and it's good to know, there are those like myself both men and women.  Again, thank you all!  Really did help a lot, and made me feel a lot better.  And in fact gave me some direction on how to better approach situations.

I currently use hair removal creams as my SO prefers less hair. Lately I'm starting to get in-grown hairs and it just feels like it's not as effective as it was when I did it the first time.

I was once bullied by a woman into getting everything waxed off, the pain was so extreme and intense that I had to ask her to stop before she completely finished, I really felt I was going to vomit with the pain - If I decide to go back (and it is something I'm considering) is there anything I can do to reduce the level of pain?

But mainly, please ease my mind that you're not judging my vagina while you wax...

*EDIT*: Okay, I don't actually have a daughter, I was being humorous while attempting to make the point that young girls are vulnerable to the advances of older men because they are too naive to understand the situation fully (e.g; may lie about their age, sneak out at night, lie to their parents about where they will be etc.) . Therefore, they may make decisions that they may regret later or may put them at harm. I am in no way saying that it is the woman's responsibility to deflect unwanted male attention. It is ultimately, of course, the responsibility of society, and parents, to educate males that unfettered sexual advances--especially towards young girls who are not peers--is not acceptable behavior. The appropriate, and truly manly, action is to understand that young girls, although they may look physically mature, are not ready for an adult relationship and therefore treat them as you would your own daughter.

Instead, although the result wasn't the most desired one, I have grown exponentially and have gained so much. I'm no longer paralyzed by asking for a number, offering coffee, paying for food on the first date, calling instead of texting, using the word date to begin with, being direct about my feelings, and handling rejection.

She's always been thin, but when I began changing my eating habits and exercising regularly to begin my weight loss journey (I started at 250), she joined me and made it a lot easier for me to stick with it. She's lost weight too, and she feels a lot better about her physical appearance. 

I feel like it's important to point out the fact that I'm overweight. Because I'm so overweight, it feels weird for me to give her fashion advice, even though I consider myself to be pretty fashionable. I know how to dress my body, but when it comes to dressing for HER body, I feel as though I would come off as petty if I gave her advice because she'd just think I was being jealous or insincere. If that makes sense.

So here's the scenario:

She was trying to pick an outfit to wear to my brother's high school graduation (she's tagging along with me). She tried on a tiny yellow strapless bra wrap thing and a skirt and asked me what I thought. 

I didn't know what to say about the fact that I could see her nipples through the (cheaply made) cotton bra. 

I don't like to put her down because she has had trouble with her self esteem and I have been really proud of the progress she's made lately. The fact that she is comfortable enough to wear more form fitting and revealing clothing tells me a lot about the progress she's made and when she feels better about herself, so do I. 

But it was my little brother's high school graduation, and my entire family was going to be there. I admit, I was a little embarrassed about the idea of her showing up dressed like that. I didn't think it was appropriate for her to wear that outfit, so I told her that the top was very see-through and that maybe she could wear something else. 

After that, she told me she regretted even asking my advice and that instead of making her feel better, I made her feel even worse about herself. 

It seems as though I can never win. 

How am I supposed to communicate the fact that I WANT her to look her best, and and that I'm not just some jealous girl who wants her to ""cover up""? Because that's what she made me feel like even though I explained afterward that she should ultimately make her own decision about what she was going to wear, regardless of what other people thought. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

My argument started out, from a man's standpoint and excluding all religious arguments, legislation regarding abortion is rather sexist.

My reasoning:
A woman does not need the man's permission to have an abortion or keep the baby. What if I was a man looking forward to being a father, and the woman decided she wanted an abortion? There is nothing I could do to stop her. For me, this seemed unacceptable.

She made a great counter argument that the issue of abortion is not about what happens after the baby is born, the man does not need to carry the baby inside of him for 9 months. She says it would be sheer torture to carry an unwanted pregnancy in her body. She also acknowledged that it would be terrible for the man who wanted the baby, but if he really wanted to be a father it would be possible for him to find a willing surrogate. 

I accepted this as an answer to look at the issue from ""man wants baby, woman doesn't and gets an abortion."" Now looking at this from the other side:

A man and a woman have sex and the woman is pregnant. The man decides he does not want to be a father, and asks her to get an abortion. She says no and has the baby. Now the father is stuck with a financial burden for the rest of his life for an unwanted child. If the situation was reversed, the woman could have an abortion and rid herself and effectively (wanted or not) the man of all responsibility. The man does not have the right to do the same.

What do the women of Reddit think:
Should men be able to sign legal documents absolving himself of the responsibility of fathering a child, before the fetus reaches a certain age (the age where having an abortion becomes impossible or dangerous)? I understand you could not force a woman to have an abortion, so this seems like a fair compromise.

TLDR: Should men be able to sign legal documents absolving himself of the responsibility of fathering a child, before the fetus reaches a certain age (the age where having an abortion becomes impossible or dangerous)?

**Edit:** Seems to me, the most effective argument here is that when a man signs a ""legal"" abortion, the child still exists in reality and therefore becomes a burden for the woman and on the child when it is born (not knowing who their father is, having to live ""without"" because of a lack of support, etc.) When a woman has an abortion, the child ceases to exist, therefore no burden is placed on either party. I think this is a fair argument, and I realize now that a financial abortion may not be the best idea because of this. 

I am not changing my position that men deserve more rights then are granted to them, but I have yet to form a complete conclusion as to what these should be.

Today, I also learned that some people here are incredibly sexist and seem to think that only a man is responsible for having sex. All these comments about how men shouldn't ejaculate into a vagina are incredible offensive, because in case you didn't know, it takes 2 people to have sex.  The burden of birth control is on both parties, and if one party fails to uphold their end of the deal, this creates a whole mess of issues for both of them.

Her father (my god-father) is a single parent and not around very often due to work. Consequently, I have assumed many guardian roles which also include buying her clothes. She attends a private school where she is required to wear a uniform, but outside of campus premises she is obviously allowed to wear whatever she wants. I used to let her just pick out whatever she wanted and never thought twice about it (Im a 23 year old male). 

But very recently she brought me to a store we never went before (PINK) to grab short-short denims and sweat pants with words on the butt side. Suddenly, as I saw these articles, all my experience as a young bachelor came rushing down on me in a form of a great dark and heavy weight. I was not always the most respectful guy and I definitely do not want my god-daughter to ever be treated that way. With quick passion and fury, I had to shut her down immediately and walk out of the store. She was shocked for it was the first time I said no to her as far as shopping for clothes is concerned. She is slightly upset, but seems to have come to terms with my explanation. Should I feel bad? 

We live in New York City and she is far more fashion conscious than I. I get her only name-brand clothes and have never considered price an issue. In fact, I go out of my way to not let her wear cheap things. But there is a part of me that feels slightly guilty about what happened and I was wondering if I should just go out and get her the PINK stuff. I don't want her to be outcasted by her peers, but I also don't want her to be ""one of those girls"" from my past experiences. 

**ADDITIONAL INFO**: Her mother passed away last year and her father works 70-90 hours a week and travels quite a bit, so I try to do my best to make her happy. She has no female role-models. 

**Allowance** I continued the system she had with her mother in which she received a sort of ""commission"" for getting A's or receiving trophies and awards. She is conscious that money is not infinite and is a big saver. She primarily uses money to buy gifts for others or to donate. Her mother was a charity worker abroad, so my god-daughter grew up experiencing and witnessing much of the world's poverty. As of now, I don't see any apparent signs of her feeling that she is better than anyone or too good for certain brands.

We don't live in the same city anymore, but we try to see each other a few times a year. I've noticed now that he's moved to a larger city and has more gay friends that his mannerisms have changed drastically. That's fine, he's still my friend and I'll always love him. However, and I know this is a common thing: he and his friends will refer to each other as ""she"" when one of them is taking a long time to get ready, is being a pain, or being overly dramatic. Even in popular culture, this seems to be generally accepted.

If a straight man does this, it's considered incredibly sexist, so why is this okay for a gay man to do so? The more I hear it, the more offended I get by it. You do not identify as a woman and you are clearly using it to tease each other - just like straight men do. I've always just laughed it off, but I find it to be pretty offensive.

I recently broke up with my boyfriend of four months. After about a week of me being too angry to talk to him, we finally were able to sit down and do a postmortem on the fight and the break up. He apologized, I forgave him, and we agreed to be friends. For the next three weeks (until yesterday) I tried to be friendly while he sat around and acted mopey. We had several discussions about our relationship; he maintained that he wanted to remain friends, but he was just taking time to get over the break up. I told him maybe he should take some time by himself, but he said he'd rather hang out with me. 

A few days ago he propositions me for casual sex. I said, ""I think that would be disastrous. You would probably get hurt."" He said, ""No, no, I'm over that now."" I thought to myself, ""Yeah right!"" And I refused him. 

Then yesterday I receive an email from him saying that he's tired of me ""punishing him for one mistake"" and he's sick of the ""abuse"" I'm piling on him. Now this blindsided me. Here I am, trying to act friendly, polite, and non-confrontational so he can recover and maybe we can be friends again, and he thinks I'm punishing him? 

**tl;dr The conclusion I have reached is that this guy thinks I only ""broke up"" with him to punish him for his mistake, despite all my words to the contrary. Once I forgave him, in his mind, I would fall back into his arms and we would resume our trust and romance. Has anyone else experienced this kind of reality dissonance?**

Jane Austen story time:

This whole thing reminds me of [this scene](http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/ppv1n19.html) from Pride and Prejudice. Mr. Collins proposes to Lizzy, who rejects him most politely. Mr. Collins says, 

&gt; ""I am not now to learn, that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""  

They go back and forth for a while, and Lizzy says two things that perfectly describe my feelings right now:

&gt; You puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.

What I'm trying to ask is if medical technology were to advance to a point where a machine could act as an artificial womb in which an already fertilized egg could be placed and a fetus could develop would this be an appealing alternative to traditional pregnancy for you. For arguments sake lets say that the new technology carries the exact same risks to the child birthing difficulties etc, and the risks to the mother are the same (so in place of difficulties in delivering the child the process of removing the fertilized egg is risky).
Some arguments I can think of are   
Pro- no morning sickness, no need for time of work.    
con- perhaps lack of bonding?

No harm meant, I'm just wondering exactly how common this is.

Edit: Yes, I know that coercion by men in the same line of thought is common too. That's certainly horrible just not what I'm asking about. Maybe someone should make an Askmen thread to ask about men who have heard or thought about that?

Edit2: Lots of visceral responses, It's comforting to know the women of reddit are so strongly against this attitude (which I kind of figured.) Maybe it's something you only hear from the older generation? A few stories of it happening have been posted too.

I also vaguely remember feeling the drug hit and stepping outside to collect my thoughts. From what I've been able to piece together so far it seems that when I stepped outside a man started to drag me away from the bar. I have no recollection of this but apparently I was smart enough to start calling virtually everyone in my phone book and I texted someone telling them what was happening. 

I somehow got away from the man who was dragging me and a friend came and got me but according to her we didn't stick together for long. I have absolutely no idea what happened after that, or how I got home. Apparently I was also followed by someone in a car so either the same guy circled back with a car the second time or it was just a night for creeps.

We’ve gained over 5,000 subscribers in the last month alone and this sort of growth shows no signs of stopping- the Mod team is extremely excited about this but it also means we’re experiencing some growing pains of sorts. We’ve added three new moderators recently, **Mahayana, Squinkie,** and **DugongOfJustice**- so welcome to them!

AskWomen prides itself on being a bit of a sanctuary from the rest of Reddit; and the Mod team works hard to create a place in which users are comfortable to both ask and answer questions. We take our sidebar rules seriously and when in the past we may have let a few of the rules slide, with this new growth we are asking users to strongly familiarize (or re-familiarize) themselves with the sidebar. The mods will be taking a stricter stance in regards to the rules and we don’t want anyone to find themselves in a spot of trouble out of ignorance.

Some things we’d like to emphasize:

• **Posts must have a descriptive question in the title** that gives users the gist of the post. **Good Ex:** “Would you be mad if a guy asked you to buy different underwear” as opposed to **Bad Ex:** “Why was my girlfriend mad at this?” Posts without specific title questions will be removed and asked to repost.

• **This is not a dating advice subreddit.** If you are looking for dating advice, please direct yourself to /r/dating_advice or /r/relationships.

• **Harrassment, name calling, gendered slurs, and personal attacks or any sort are not tolerated in this subreddit.** Those comments will be removed and you may be banned.

• People here will often have different opinions from yours. AskWomen is made up of thousands and thousands of individuals with individual opinions- **downvoting comments out of disagreement does a huge disservice to the community.** We don’t want to remove downvote arrows like some other subreddits, we prefer instead to expect users to conduct themselves like adults. **If something is worth downvoting, it's worth reporting.  If it's not worth reporting, don't downvote it.** Which brings us to our next point...

• **Use the report button.** Reporting comments and threads that violate the sidebar rules is an immense help to the mod team. There are literally thousands of you and there are a few of us. Reports are anonymous and they do a great deal more to improve the quality of discourse than to attack disrespectful commentary with even more disrespectful commentary.  

On top of all that- just don’t be a jerk. Some of the topics discussed in AskWomen are sensitive and incendiary, we understand that. AskWomen is first and foremost, a place where women need to feel comfortable sharing their opinions on things. Remember that.

**Tips on viewing the sidebar rules from a smartphone:**

*Reddit is Fun:* at the top of an individual subreddit page there is a little info button that looks like an “i” in a circle. Clicking that button will open a page with the sidebar rules.

*Alien Blue:* the middle button on the toolbar while accessing the subreddit will lead you to a page where you have an option to access the sidebar rules.

**Lastly:** Thank you so much, from all the mods, to eveyrone who regularly contributes to making AskWomen the awesome place that it is.  Keep it up.",,False,,t5_2rxrw,False,,female-mod,True,t3_14ei38,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14ei38/growing_pains_mod_post/,moderator

R/askwomen started out of a thread on r/twoxchromosomes to have a place where women on reddit, then polled at about 30% of users could answer the types of questions that came up often there in an environment where they felt comfortable expressing opinions that might not be popular on a male-dominated site. 

The subreddit has steadily grown since then and for the last few months has consistently been in the top 50 of average comments made per day and top 100 users online at any given time. Impressive considering the number of subreddits that are many times larger than us. 

I'm so often impressed by the heartfelt and insightful comments left here both by regular users and fly-bys. Thank you to everyone who helps create stimulating and thought provoking conversation. Thank you also to those who keep it lighthearted and fun.

Most recently: New Year's Eve. 

My friends and I went to a fancy New Year's Eve charity event downtown, and I went 'stag'. I didn't want to be alone at midnight, so I went to the bar and started talking to people. I met a very interesting girl, who also didn't have anyone to kiss at midnight. We absolutely 'clicked', it was amazing. It was one of those conversations that make guys remember why we don't just buy a fleshlight and register a Brazzers account. You know those types of conversations? They're great. 

[Not this](http://qkme.me/3sg3m5)

Needless to say, while I had only known this girl for ~20 minutes, I was excited I had met someone fun but was scared to invite her to the table my group was at.  After a few more minutes, one of her girlfriends came over and stole her to go to the bathroom to do whatever the hell it is that you do in there. I assume it is anything but pee. I gave her a hug and told her if she didn't meet me at my table in 10 minutes I would send out a search party. Add a few seconds of good eye contact, and she was pulled away. 

At this point, I'm standing there in a suit, watching her walk away, and pretty much feeling like that Marlon Brando gif I've seen on r/ladyboners 1,000 times. 

I leave the bar and maneuver through the heathens to the other side of the venue, where my group had reserved a table. There was a mix of girls in relationships, and single girls, all of whom I know well and age from 22-25. I love them to death, but they're very 'protective'. So when my new friend returns from the bathroom, my friends go from being absolute sweethearts to some sort of mother bear clan who is protecting their cub from a nuclear charged alligator. My new friend comes up to me and put her arm around me, I return the favor and give her a quick side hug. In the two seconds the hug took place, body language changed. 

My friends now enter momma bear mode, and became much more flirty with me. All of this was to intimidate the new girl. They would come up and pull my tie, fix my collar, put their phone in my pocket, etc.,  basically raising the level of physical contact. This, of course, made my new friend feel uncomfortable, and this was not the first time. They have scared other girls off before, and justified it by saying it's because they didn't like them and thought they were wrong for me. Out of the women I introduce to them, some are too bitchy, some are too fake, too tall, too short, too tan, too red-headed, etc. 

I find it endearing, and appreciate that they care about me that much, but holy shit, I'm 25, I'm not looking for a wife tomorrow. I've told them this, and they said they will stop when I find a nice girl that they can trust around me. So far that has been 1 person in the last 4 years, and of course she moved to Kansas. I value their input on girls that I'm considering dating, but if it's some girl I met at a bar and neither of us have dating intentions, I don't see why my friends need to be so judgmental. As my friends, shouldn't they be guiding my cock? Not blocking it? 

I have talked to them about it, and this post is basically a transcript of what I told them. But they continue to shamelessly do it. 

Apart from the obvious 'don't bring one-night-stands around you friends', how can I communicate with them that they need to stop intentionally preventing me from being around other women? 


TL;DR - My female friends intentionally scare away all of my potential hookups. How do I keep them from cock blocking me?

I certainly do.  But my SO doesn't like it, actually.  It's one of the few things we disagree on.  If I know I'm going to be working at night, I make sure to let her know because she doesn't like coming over if I'm working.

I was unaware, and I think it's partially because I don't make catcalls and, being married, I don't ask women out at all, but also because I tend to plug into my headphones and go into my own little world when I'm outside. Now that I know about this, though, I'm thinking about unplugging and engaging with the world a bit more.

I generally make an effort to engage in small acts of kindness when I see the opportunity -- picking up a dropped umbrella, holding a door for an extra second or two, giving up a parking spot, that sort of thing. I do this regardless of the demographics of the individual in need, and I usually consider myself a ""safe"" person to offer assistance to young women, because I am married and have a wedding ring on the usual finger. I figure by displaying my marital status, and offering assistance without offering conversation, and by asking for permission to help (when possible), I am not behaving in a threatening manner.

What I'm thinking about, though, is not everyday small acts of kindness, but rather ""taking it to the streets,"" if you will, and taking a more active, engaged role in helping people when they're being bothered. That is, if I see a woman being catcalled or harassed, yelling out something like ""Mind your manners!"" or ""Knock it off!"" or whatever. I've done this a few times with women on the subway who are being harassed by a guy who's hitting on them too aggressively. I'll make eye contact and say, ""hey don't I know you?"" while holding my wedding band and making a sympathetic face at her. A brief conversation about whatever, the guy usually wanders off, we nod and I go back to my own business. Sometimes I have to fake a long conversation, but that's the worst it's ever gone.

I guess my question is whether women in general feel like they are made helpless by random strangers helping them or defending them? Or is it a welcome gesture?  I might as well try to help, right? Not because I think I'll get laid for it, but because it's right to do. 

Or is there inherent in this gesture an implication that said woman cannot defend herself, or that by interfering on her behalf, I am taking away the opportunity for her to defend herself?

I'm honestly quite torn about it.  I have to go for a bit, so I won't get back to read any replies until probably 3 or so. Any advice you ladies have is most welcome. I am particularly interested in what women themselves have to say, not what men say the women in their lives have to say. 

Thanks for your time.

**edit:  There are a lot of great responses here, a lot to chew on. I think the take-home seems to be not to bother with the catcalling stuff, because women generally know how to deal with that (ignoring it, mostly). At least, that's my impression from the posts here. On the other hand, in a situation where the woman seems legitimately frightened, a greeting and distraction of the situation seems to be in order. Similarly, if the woman is in a situation where she can't easily escape, something like the ""Oh hey, don't I know you?"" with a knowing look.**

**My only real disagreement is with the woman who said that I should ask whether the gentleman on the subway/bus is bothering her. That seems likely to escalate the situation, particularly given that I am rather a large and imposing-looking man, or so people tell me.

I am divorced, and had a very bad marriage, and an even worse divorce. I was single for about 4 years after the divorce before i was ready to even consider dating. I dated a few girls, but every time they found out about my kids, i was either hands off, or they went in to crazy mommy mode. Both are infuriating. Then i reconnected with ""Jane"", someone i have known since high school. We hung out a bunch of times as friends, and then it became romantic.
Now to the question: I love ""Jane"". We have been together for 4 years now, and we have successfully built what i think is a great, healthy life together. However, i am in no way ready or really interested in getting married again. From my view of experience, i see it fairly pragmatically, in that there is not any real benefits to us, we are not financially responsible enough at this points (due to job changes for the worse, most of my money is eaten up by child support, so she is the bread winner in the relationship and we scrape by most months, so a big or even moderately sized wedding is out of the question), and at this point in our life, we are not likely to have more children (though i can see myself raising another child, i am in no hurry to actually do so, and if it doesn't happen, oh well.). She seems to understand this all, though i know that she has a very romantic view of marriage and what she wants. But why does society put such a huge stigma on marriage in general? As a couple who live together, everywhere we go i am being judged because we are not married, and friends of both of ours have even gone so far as to try to poison her against me because i am not interested in marriage. To me, it doesn't mean that i don't love her, because i do, or that i don't want to be with her for the rest of my life, because i honestly do. It is more of a logical thing to me at this point.

After that, I usually bring the leftovers to colleagues. The mother and daughter usually have a few pieces. I've noticed that a lot more pieces get eaten and I get more praise if I bake something when the daughter is on her period.

I was thinking of regularly baking when the daughter was on her period. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do.

I don't know if I should report him or try to talk to him about respecting my space, but I don't know how long I can keep putting up with it. So, basically, at what point is it acceptable to report someone for harassment?

**Update 2** I spoke with the principal and he promised me he would speak with this boy and let him know that his advances are unwelcome and make me uncomfortable. I know some people are concerned that I would be causing him more trouble than necessary, but I've only asked that he be told not to have contact with me. I'm not trying to hurt anyone, I just want to be left alone :( I have that class in a few hours and I'll return to update on his behavior in the class.

She's very sensitive though and is scared to go through the mandatory counseling and ultrasound. She's also scared about the actual abortion. We've talked about it and, while she's sure this is what she wants, she's going to need my help.

Her hormones are messing with her pretty badly. She's crying, nauseated, scared. We're thinking it's about 3 weeks in or so. She's also 20. I really badly need help with two things: 1) How to help her - I've been suggesting medicine to help with nausea and spending lots of time comforting her and I'm taking care of all of the logistics of the abortion (finding a location/paying/etc.), and 2) I need help figuring out how to get around the mandatory counseling/ultrasound.

I know how hard that's going to be on her and I really don't want her to have to deal with this stupid added stress. We live in central TX (Austin area). I look into Louisiana and I see that they require counseling/ultrasound. If I absolutely have to I will drive her to whatever feasible state (even though I don't think this will happen since she will probably decline). If we stay here, how much of this do we have to put up with? She says that she wants to remove herself from the situation as much as possible, to the point that she'd like to be ""knocked out"" for the procedure if possible. Can I go in with her? Can she wear headphones and look away during the ultrasound?

I wanna thank all of you for your advice, and for the kind words about my character! My GF is likely a little less grateful for my temporarily increased ego, but I genuinely appreciated the responses. I also want to apologize for not responding to anyone directly, I wasn't really in a position where I could yesterday, but I read everyone's replies, and took them to heart. (Also, sorry I'm so long-winded)

The overwhelming response was that I needed to tell my girlfriend, which I think was always my intent, but it definitely spurred me into action. When she got home yesterday, I sat her down and explained the situation. I tried to be as delicate as I could, but it was hard for me to address the scenario without commenting on how I felt about her friend as a person. I never used a word as strong as ""toxic,"" but I think that could've been easily inferred from what I was saying. Besides brief questions about how I responded and what I thought, my girlfriend was silent and had a stoic face throughout most of my explanation. Maybe ""stoic"" isn't the right word... She sort of had a look as if she had always expected something like this would happen, and was emotionally prepared for it.

After a bit of silence, she told me that she had been getting this vibe from her friend's behavior around me for a few weeks (which was honestly totally lost on me), but that she had figured she was imagining things. She grabbed her keys, kissed me, and went off to her friend's house to talk to her.

If there's one thing I can say about this whole scenario, looking back on my thread yesterday, and then looking at my GF's actions, it's that I completely underestimated her. She's an exceedingly kind person, and she always sees the best in everyone, and I always mistook that as her being kind of a pushover, at least with her close friends. With her best friend in particular, it always felt like my GF going the extra mile was expected of her, but never reciprocated.

Anyway, yeah, she was gone for what felt like an eternity (it was about 2 or 3 hours), and she got back with the same kind of determined look on her face. I pressed her for information, and this is evidently how their encounter played out (I have to do this - GF = A, friend = B. The following paragraph was a *mess*):

My GF confronted her friend directly. After some side-stepping and teeth-pulling, B admitted to having expressed her feelings for me, and burst into tears. A then went on to say that what B had done crossed so many boundaries, and was so childish, as to be ridiculous. I guess she told her friend things I had always perceived, but never really realized my girlfriend was consciously aware of. How B was selfish and demanding, and how she used her friendship with A as justification for the way she acted. She would never be able to have legitimate, adult relationships if she kept using A as a crutch, because that friendship validated the way she had always been. A pointed out how, over the years, all of B's friends faded from her life because of her refusal to put forth the effort they put forth for her, and because of her lack of consideration for their feelings.

The discussion ended, as I'm told, with my GF telling her that they would always be friends, but B needs to get her shit together before they can communicate comfortably again. She doesn't know if it will be weeks, or months, but my GF thinks their friendship should be worth enough for them to be able to overcome the radio silence that's to follow.

So, yeah. Bringing this situation up with my girlfriend, I really wanted to be careful not to frame it as something like her having to choose me over her friend. I never wanted to come between them, despite how I felt. As it turns out, this didn't really have a lot to do with me at all (largely because I think my GF trusts me, especially after this event). Her friend coming on to me (not how I would have phrased it before the responses I got yesterday, which my GF seemed to agree with) was just the catalyst for this discussion that was years in the making.

I'd say that, ultimately, everything that came out of this scenario turned out pretty positively. I am *extremely* attracted to the way my GF took command the situation, and I'd say she was pretty attracted to me being so forthcoming (due, in no small part, to all of you) and faithful (which I never really considered a question). So... thanks again!

**tl;dr Told my GF everything. She confronted her friend, and decided that their friendship needed a hiatus so that her friend could do some growing up, and so that trust could be reestablished down the line. Super thanks to all of the women (and dudes) who responded for lighting a fire under me and helping me bring this to light faster than I likely would have!**",,False,,t5_2rxrw,False,,,True,t3_wqgnb,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/wqgnb/update_girlfriends_best_friend_expressed_feelings/,

3. Women have less pressure to maintain the relationship, be good at sex etc. and can basically treat the man like she is giving him a great honour with her presence. 
4. Can walk out of marriages for not much reason at all without worrying about consequences, whereas men have to worry about losing half their money to alimony, even though female earning power is rapidly approaching male earning power

1367877789.0,165,self.AskWomen,1dtjok,UPDATE: How should a transgender man approach a woman without freaking her out or scaring her off?,that_guy_ronald,213,48,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1dtjok/update_how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a/,"Alright, so my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/wdzha/how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a_woman/) was made over 9 months ago. A lot has happened since then, some good stuff and some not so good stuff, but in the end mostly good stuff...

A summary of my last post: I was born with a female body but I am a man, which makes me a transgender man (FTM); though to be accurate and honest, I mostly reject my trans-ness and identify as a man. Plain and simple. After a pretty shitty relationship and break up I decided to start dating again but didn’t know how to approach the issue of being transgender. I am very comfortable with my body and have a strong preference for straight, very feminine women. This preference had not worked out well for me so far and lead me to get turned down a lot. My question to /r/AskWomen was how I could approach women and inform them of my “situation” without putting them off or scaring them off.

Alright, so how have the last 9 months gone?

Well, not too long after I made that post I kind of got into a friends with benefits situation with an ex-girlfriend of mine from college. We provided each other with a lot of emotional support and had sex whenever I was in town (it was long distance, but she is going to school in my hometown so I visited frequently). It was mostly a crutch and it wasn’t a very satisfying sexual relationship. I fapped a lot, per usual.

While I was doing that whole FWB thing, up until the new year, I was keeping my eye open to possibilities. I started getting out of my shell a lot more, which was a challenge in and of itself, being in a new city and all. I would go out with my friends to break dancing clubs, burlesque shows, out to see local DJs and bands play, and just out to the bars. Basically, if there was something I wanted to do or see or experience,  I wouldn’t hesitate to do/see/experience it. I treated approaching women the same way. If there was a woman that caught my eye I would approach her, buy her a drink, be suave and shit and I usually had a good conversation but didn’t feel enough of a connection to pursue it further. This might be because I wasn’t ready or because I my FWB crutch or because the girls just really weren’t all that great, who knows, but regardless nothing came of those adventures.

Well, I wouldn’t say that nothing came of it. I got really good at just talking to women and ordering drinks and becoming friends with everyone, especially bartenders. Not to mention, I got to hang out with some of my friends and do cool shit, and doing cool shit is fun.

**Relationship # 1**

But one of my friends really wanted to set me up with her best friend. I was pretty skeptical about this from the beginning. Basically, I had hung out with this girl a few times at the bar or at a party and small talk was fine but she didn’t seem that, well, deep. Another thing, she mostly dates women. But, after my original post, I was more open to the idea of dating bisexual women.

So, because this woman was a friend of a friend, she was already privy to the plumbing in my pants, if you follow me. No mystery, there. New Years Eve rolls around and we basically double date with our mutual friend. I kiss her at midnight, get her number, pay her tab, get wasted, dry out, and drive home. We make plans to go on a few dates and do. I do my lady-killer moves and she’s just... blah. Eventually we have sex and the first time it was good, and after that it was awful. The worst kind of dead fish situation. I’m not sure if she was intimidated or nervous, but she was never open to communication so it just sucked. 

I should have listened to my gut to begin with. I honestly don’t think she’s into guys and I think she has a misconception about what it would be like dating a transman. I am not at all some kind of androgynous, embrace-my-femininity kind of guy; I have all of the best and worst parts of being a man and I really don’t think she was into any of that. But hey, we all have preferences and I wasn’t hers and she wasn’t mine. By the time I realized that I was done it was less than a week before Valentines Day, so I decided to wait until after to break it off. Big mistake. She got weird and clingy and distant all at the same time and it was a bad two weeks. It’s over though, so, *whew.*

When I realized that I was consistently dating this woman from NYE I had told my FWB that I was seeing someone and didn’t want either of them to get the wrong idea about the situation, meaning that I ended the FWB thing. But then, once things ended with the NYE woman I started talking to my FWB again.

**Relationship # 2**

This whole time I had an account on OKCupid, with nothing in my profile to suggest that I’m a transman. I opened the account when I was still in college, trying to meet people to hang out with once I moved, but no one ever messaged me (which was frustrating) and no one ever messaged me back (which is even more frustrating). I was only checking it about once a week for shits and giggles and getting back into the concerts, bars, and burlesque show routine, but then I got this message from this woman with awesome dimples and a beautiful smile. She actually messaged me about Reddit, of all things, and I later found out that she had searched specifically for redditors (so thank you, reddit, for doing me a solid there). 

Within two days out brief messages became pages long and we set up a date. Wasting no time! Based on our profiles and messages, it was inevitable that we would click right away, and of course we did. I took her out to a nice dinner, wine and dined her, did all my lady-killer moves and everything. Even though I was hella nervous (and so was she) we both had a great time. I kind of got ahead of myself and went for the kill. I asked her if I could kiss her, she said yes, and I did. I hadn’t disclosed yet that I was trans. I got back into my car and was basically yelling at myself. I had given myself that one rule: no physical intimacy before disclosure, based on my original post, and I broke it. This was the only time I broke that rule, and damned if I was going to let that one mistake ruin the first true connection I’ve ever felt with a woman. (And this would be where I broke it off with my FWB for the second time, though she didn't get the hint and I had to spell it out for her a week later.)

I knew I needed to tell her but I was pretty nervous about the whole thing. I ended up looking at her OKCupid profile again just to check if she had answered the ""Would you date a transgender person?"" question. Yeah, that question exists, and yeah, she did answer it. She had said ""no"". Well, damn. But I couldn't ignore the connection we had, and an answer on an online dating profile isn't a real answer or rejection, so I decided to just tell her and see where it went anyway.

So, we talk again the next day, and everything is great. Then I got super distant for a while (like half of a day). I needed to tell her, since we were *thiiiis close* to planning our second date. I actually have the text messages from when I told her:

&gt; **Ronald:** Damn you beat me to it! I was going to ask you but I was cleaning my shower (it was awful). But yes. We should. Before we go ahead making plans I just wanted to tell you something. It's not a big deal to me but I want to be open and honest with you. I'm a trans guy.

&gt; **Girl:** That's legit. I appreciate you telling me. That's awesome that you're so chill about it.
It's not something I would go actively searching for, but its not a deal breaker either. I'm probably technically bisexual, though I've never acted on it. 

&gt; **Ronald:** Welp. That's fantastic. So, where to tomorrow?
(feel free to ask me anything, btw. I'm pretty open about it once I break the stealth seal)

&gt; **Girl:** Where to? I'm up for whatever. I had Thai tonight though, so I would prefer not that! :P
How long have you been on hormones? I'm assuming you must be? I don't know much about this whole thing. What kind of things do people normally ask? :)

And that’s basically how it went. I walked her through the bigger topics, she asked questions, I gave answers, and mostly we planned our second date. We saw a comedy show and had pizza. It was nice. She also slept over that night because we just didn’t want to be done with the date, though clothes stayed on.

Sex happend on date number three, which was a mellow night at my apartment. That was also the night that I asked her to be my girlfriend. Basically, all of my trans stuff was a non-issue for her. I think this has a lot to do with my honesty and openness, and pretty much where I am in my life and transition. I think that if I was insecure with myself then she would have reacted differently. I think our success together has a lot to do with our mutual timing; she was finally in a good place with her stuff, I was finally in a good place with my stuff, and it just worked. When she mentioned being “bisexual” she was more-so referencing being attracted to masculine people, regardless of genitalia. She has never date women or been in a relationship with a woman. She’s only ever treated me as a man and I have never felt more comfortable in my role in a relationship.

We’re still dating. It’s been two months, two of the most amazing months. Not only is all of the emotional and gooey shit fantastic, but the sex is amazing. We recently incorporated a prosthetic for me (read: strap on), and it’s given a whole new and exciting dynamic to sexy time.

So, yeah. That’s been my exploits for the last 9 months. I’m up for answering questions (in comments or PMs) so feel free! 

**TL;DR** Fuck you. I just spent a long time writing that, go read it!

EDIT 1: I just want to thank everyone for the positive response to this post. I know a lot of other trans guys also appreciate the fact that so many people understand why it's importnat to recognize the good stuff and to talk about it. My girlfriend ([TheDukesMistress](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1dtjok/update_how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a/c9tt0e1)) also really enjoyed chiming in and adding her perspective. This whole experience has inspired us to start a collaborative YouTube channel in an effort to continue this discourse on relationships with trans men as well as to provide a resource for people who are new to coming into a trans relationship. We want to provide a resource that we would want, basically. Thanks again for all of the well wishes and inspiring comments. Even those who did not understand or agree were very polite and generally thoughtful with their comments.

Wishing everyone a great day,

I have a bachelor's degree, but it is in visual arts, so there might be a bit of stigma there, too. Something frustrating that I've noticed with the last few guys I've dated, though, is that the way they talk to me makes it seem like they think my intelligence is pretty low. It's hard to really give examples because it's mostly little things they will say. One guy sometimes spoke to me like I was a dog or a child, with a baby voice, if he thought the conversation was about something over my head.

I don't usually date this much, so I'm wondering if this is a problem many women have. Or maybe it's because I am only looking for flings so they assume I'm some dumb girl? (I'm not saying girls who look for flings are dumb; just wondering if that's a stereotype that could be affecting the way they see me.) I don't know. But I'm starting to get frustrated about always feeling like I have to prove my intelligence.

Anyone else have this problem? How did you handle it? Was I just unlucky to have dated guys who act like this, or is this something that happens a lot?

This was a trait that came after her abusive boyfriend sexually assaulted her a few years ago, and it made me happy to see her lively and full of confidence after that hard time for her. She went back to dating a guy she knew before her ex, and things were going well, until they broke up. She was pretty bent up about it, understandably.

However, lately she has been steadily increasing in the amount of guys she sees romantically, especially at work. It's not normally a problem, but it's not normal for her, so it kind of raised a red flag for me. Her work environment became increasingly flirtatious, and last week, it culminated in one of her superiors sexting her and sending two pictures of his penis. 

I talked to her about it, and he said she felt ashamed, and couldn't say no to him because she wanted a ""peaceful work environment."" I urged her to report him, which she refused flatly.

Just yesterday at work, the same guy grabbed her boobs when the big boss was outside the door. She was flustered, and was a little shocked that he'd risk her job like that. Again, I urged her to report him, which she refuses to do.

This isn't her first case of sexual harassment at work, either. Late last year, a new guy coerced her into his car and tried to rape her. She was reluctant to report him, but when she did, she told her superior, the same guy that's harassing her now. 

I neglected to mention that her superior is 23.

Is there anything I can do to help her? I feel so helpless as her friend. What can she do, and how can I help her do it?

*EDIT:* Talked at length with her about it today, and she decided that she wasn't going to press anything because she instigated the sexting. She will talk to the guy about groping her at work, but as far as reporting it, she doesn't think it's worth it. She also told me she got a call for a summer job north of where we live, so she's going to put in her two weeks this month.

Thanks everyone for your advice. I'm still considering telling her dad, but we'll see how the next few days go. If I find out he did it again, I will. I know it's not entirely a proactive solution, but I respect her and how she wants to handle it.

They dated for ~2 months. 
I didn't observe anything 'obsessive' - no constant texting/calls no evidence they were intimate beyond hugging and smooching - ""through the clothing"" stuff.

Her last boyfriend, and 1st ""real"" boyfriend, shot and killed himself while texting with her last year.  
Four months before that, she was hospitalized for anorexia and is currently controlling it pretty well.
She tends to be pretty emo and dark, but has recently started to show a little color in her dress and style, and begun avoiding some people that she became aware cause her to feel bad when she spends time with them.We'd like that trend to continue

She doesn't share much emotionally, she shuns emotional and physical contact from her mom and me - always has, so it's really difficult to know how I can support her through this without her feeling like I""m pushing her toward feeling any certain way.  All I want is to facilitate her processing this in a constructive way.

Historically, any and all suggestions for activities to do with me and/mom are met with excuses for why they won't be fun, help, or otherwise be anything she wants to do.  I'd text her to let her know that I'm thinking about her and sorry it happened, but that really pisses her off.

All I've got so far is offering to take her bowling or bike riding tonight. Any suggestions?

**Edit*** * Thanks for the responses! I needed the information that she'll recognize I'm around for her, even if she rejects any approaches.  As a man and her father, (my need is to DO something) it's a little hard not to take that sort of thing personally. I can usually pull it off, but it's very helpful to know it's probably the right course. Thanks again.

As for the suggestion of a spa-day.  I've thought about that sort of thing in the past, but her mom suggested she might take it as a statement that she *needs* a makeover.

Also: to an anorexic, cookies, and other sweet goodies don't seem to be considered soothing gifts.*

What do?",csreid,188,31,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/13b5w6/ladies_a_rumor_is_spreading_that_im_an_attempted/,"This isn't really a question explicitly for women, but I like you folks better than askreddit.

Two years ago, at a Halloween party, I got way too drunk and slept with a girl (call her Nancy, perhaps). Without being too graphic, I am positive that I had her enthusiastic (and sober) consent. In the days following, she texted me a lot, and was just generally getting a little too attached (I was not interested in anything else happening at all, but apparently she was). I made it clear that I wasn't looking for anything else, and she took wasn't very happy about it. From then on, she pretty much didn't talk to me anymore.

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I'm out with the same friend who threw the Halloween party, and we meet a couple girls. He works with one, and he used to work with the other. I hit it off with one of these girls, spent most of the night talking to her, and she was sending every signal that she was into me (thanks for that, by the way - without the hundreds of thousands of threads here on the subject, I never would have known what was going on). I got her number, she went home, and I asked her out a few days later, and she turned me down pretty solidly. I was a little confused, but I didn't think too much of it, and I didn't text her again.

Then, on Monday, she texted me to tell me she might be going out Thursday night (i.e., last night), and was I going out? I said yes, and maybe I'd see her out. Thursday comes around, her friends bailed, I invited her along with us. She agreed, we had a great time again.

As I was walking her home, I said I was kind of surprised to hear from her, since she'd turned me down when I asked her out. She said, ""Well, can I be honest? I had heard... some stuff about you.""

Long story short, the friend she was with the night I met her had told her I was bad news, and to stay away from me because I had tried to rape a girl they work with. I told her I only knew two other girls from there - ""Sarah"", and ""Nancy"". She told me it was Nancy. She made sure to clarify that she didn't really believe it (otherwise, she wouldn't allow me to walk her home alone in the dark), but that was why she'd been leery to see me.

I don't know how far it's spread, but it hurts *bad* that someone would just throw that out there like that. I don't understand.

So... I guess my question is, what should I do about this?

Of course my sister and I were freaking out, just **knowing** that Santa was here. Years later my mom of course told us it had been my dad throwing rocks up onto the roof while she distracted us. It had snowed, and he even left hoof prints on the front lawn for us to see. They would leave red and green glitter on the carpet around our presents too, as if Santa had left it there, and of course the half eaten cookies and the half-empty glass of milk would delight us too.

One time my mom came home from work and casually mentioned how a unicorn ran across the road in front of her on her way home. Sometimes when we would be driving through wooded areas, my dad would ask us if we could see the tiny elves hiding behind the rocks and trees outside. 

On St. Patrick's day, they would put a potato in a paper bag for the leprechaun to eat. We'd wake up to a hole ripped in the bag, little bites taken out of the potato, and green glittery foot prints everywhere. There was always two sacks of those cheap chocolate gold coins left hidden for my sister and I. 

So, did your parents or guardians do things to make you believe when you were little? If so, what were they? If you're a parent now, what things do you do for your kids?

The problem is that generally, my boyfriend lasts a really long time. My limit is probably 30 minutes and then it just stops being fun.

1345326089.0,156,self.AskWomen,yg0qg,Girlfriend drunkenly said some things about her friends that kinda disturbed me. Not sure if I could or should do anything about it.,vinnivinvi,188,32,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/yg0qg/girlfriend_drunkenly_said_some_things_about_her/,"My GF is 26, I'm (m) 25. We live together and have been dating for almost two years.

Basically, my gf has been friends with her two closest friends for about a decade, since high school. I, generally, get along with both of them famously, but I honestly don't like either of them. I mean, I enjoy hanging out with them on occasion, but I don't think they're good people. Some of the reasons are personal, but the main reason is absolutely the way they treat my gf.

I wanna be clear, they're not overtly cruel to her in any way. They don't say mean things to her, they enjoy her company. They're just.... awful friends. My gf does them favors, compromises, always seems to give them the benefit of the doubt, she's just always going the extra mile. They would *never* do that. They're petty, self-obsessed women who expect the world to bend to their will.

For the most part, I keep my perceptions to myself. I'll sometimes push my girlfriend to stick to what she wants to do, or to refuse compromise sometimes, and there was a bit of a running joke where I would tell her not to respond to terrorism, but I know that despite the fact that I consider them lesser friends than her, that she's obviously getting something from her relationship with them, she *can* and *does* have a good time with them.

Anyway, last night, it was the four of us (I'm not normally present for girls' night, but I had nothing else to do and they wanted me around). We went out and were all drinking. Everyone was pretty drunk, and my gf's two friends got into their zone where they were talking about extremely trivial things and about themselves. It was *impossible* to get a word in. It used to bug me, but I've gotten used to it, and I'm guessing my GF grew accustomed to it ages ago. I wouldn't even describe what they were having as a conversation, they were literally just talking at each other, at the same time.

So, my GF and I are having a bit of a laugh, saying outrageous things directly to their face with them completely ignoring us. Then my GF kinda nudges me and says, ""Watch this!"" Basically what she said to them, none of which got through to them, was that she thought they were shitty friends, and they were assholes, and that she couldn't stand them, and that she's done so much for them and they don't appreciate at all.

I realize she was drunk, and she had a smile on her face the whole time, and was sorta relishing the moment, but it *totally* broke my heart. My gf is an optimist, and she labors to see the best in people, and I always accepted that as the reason she could tolerate these girls. In that moment though, she was practically tripping over herself describing things about them that I've never realized she was totally aware of.

It's just not fair, that someone as cool and accommodating and all the other great things she is would be stuck with friends that don't, by any stretch of the imagination, deserve her. I try really hard to be for her what she is for them, but I get that it isn't the same. She needs something from them (or, I'd hope, any female friend) that I couldn't give her. She probably doesn't even remember any of this, and she'll likely happily hang out with them again soon, but now I feel like, even if she's not saying anything, it must be how she feels a lot of the time.

I don't really know what I can do about it. It wouldn't be fair of me to sit around bitching about how awful her best friends are, and it's not like I can.... I don't even know, set her up with women that seem cool. And I know, even if she met really awesome new friends, she'd still always be friends with these girls. It's just.... you know, they'll always be friends, I can see that, but I can't stand it, and I guess sometimes neither can my GF.

Is there *anything* I can do about this? Should I confront her friends? Is it none of my business? Should I encourage scenarios where we meet new people more often, or encourage her to hang out with her friends that appreciate her more frequently? Should I let it go? It's really important for me to get some women's perspectives on this kind of relationship.

I now know that YES I must tell my partners, but my previous reasoning was that MAYBE it wasn't necessary to tell new partners because my last pap was normal, nearly all sexually active people get HPV at one point of their lives, condoms can cut down on the risk of transmission, 90% of people are able to clear HPV from their system within 2 years, and as I thought, the cervical cancer strain can't affect males (although now I see that this is untrue.) Many people have cold sores and are putting their partners at risk for getting HSV every time they kiss or engage in oral sex and yet a lot of people don't talk about it with their partners. I think you can see why it would be unclear. I'm glad I asked and YES, I will be telling people.

Not fun to find out an hour after calling your doctor to get a prescription sent over late on a Saturday night.  

I called to check that the prescription had called in before I drove over and he recognized my last name, and was like, ""That's so funny, I know a family by that name.  My daughter's teacher has that name!""  -__- Great.  

He was pretty awkward at first when we started the conversation but got more professional over time.  I'm just glad there's not a different medication for ""I'm in a long term relationship and the condom broke"" vs ""I just had unprotected sex with a stranger"" because he doesn't know a lot about me but I just feel like he was judging me and was assuming the latter. I know they're a conservative family.  

Hazards of our jobs I guess.  If this happens again I will send it to a different Walgreens.

As an aside, he also told me to take a pregnancy test to make sure I wasn't already pregnant when I took it, but pregnancy tests aren't valid that early in a pregnancy (it was less than 24 hours after condom breaking) and taking the pill doesn't have adverse effects on the baby if you are pregnant.  I don't like feeling more logical or informed than my pharmacist.  Silly healthcare industry.

I took some nausea medication before it at his suggestion and that was a great idea.  I was a bit nauseous and I also slept for 14 hours.  Fertilization prevention can be exhausting!

Also, these posts will be heavily moderated which means there will be zero tolerance for anyone breaking the subreddit's rules (see the sidebar/info button for reference) and that any derailment from the topic question will be removed.

I am a little embarrassed about this situation but I honestly don't know where to turn.

I am a 21 year old female and I have never been on birth control. I have been sexually active since I was 16 years old but have only ever used condoms.

Currently I am in a serious relationship and I would like to go on some form on birth control just to be safe. I just moved back home because I finished university and am trying to pay off my debt.

This is the embarrassing part. My mother is extremely snoopy and religious. I understand that I am 21 years of age and it is my own life, but if she found out I was on birth control she would honestly freak out and I know that it would effect our relationship (we are pretty close). My dad is a pastor of a church, but church isn't really my thing. They always talk about how I should wait to have sex and stuff and its extremely bothersome.

I don't really know what to do. My mom looks over my shoulder when I am filling out paperwork to see if I am taking BC, or see if I tick off ""Sexually Active"". She goes in my purse sometimes to grab makeup to borrow things so I have to be careful what I have in there.

I know this sounds silly but, its weighing on my mind a lot. I don't know how to go on it without her finding out, or what kind to take (the pill, the patch, the IUD ect) or how to handle this situation. Please give me some advice :(

P.S I live in Canada and have my own insurance with my work, but my mom works at the same place as I do.


EDIT: Thank you guys so much for the advice. Honestly, all of it really helps. I am going to look into getting my own personal doctor, and maybe asking their advice along with all the advice you have given me. I agree, it is my life, and my body, I should be able to do what I want.

How do I avoid this when raising my daughter?",iliketotravel,186,43,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/15eoj0/i_often_see_the_were_raised_to_avoid_conflictbe/,"Hi everyone.  I've been browsing this subreddit a little bit and have noticed a propensity of questions from men along the lines of ""why won't women just be direct?""  And invariably, many answers are ""because society teaches us to be indirect, be nice, avoid conflict"" or something along those lines.  Obviously I'm not covering all angles here of answers given, nor are my words perfect I'm sure.

But the bigger picture question, for me as a 37 year old single dad, is how do I avoid this with my daughter?  She's 11, generally quite mature for her age, and I actually ACTIVELY teach her about how to handle conflicts, how to interpret what boys (and girls) are saying and doing to her at school, and try to help her understand what she's feeling/dealing with regarding all sorts of situations.

Where does this notion of society's influence really stem from?  What exactly am I fighting against?  Her friends and teachers telling her different?  Does this societal pressure show up later in life, such as when she enters high school and college?

I hope I'm not being too vague in my question(s), but I'm genuinely curious if I should take an even more direct approach, such as asking what her friends think/say about certain situations.  Is there anything more I can do to help her understand and handle situations, especially as she starts to take an even greater interest in boys?  I'm not one to stick my head in the sand and pretend boys/men aren't going to be a part of her life; I'd rather be proactive in raising her the best I can.

Thanks in advance!!

I am a fairly easy going guy. I don't let too much upset me and I try really hard to keep my girlfriend from being upset as well. She is very easily upset, so much so that if anything happens that is non-ideal for her she becomes upset to the point of crying. She seems mad at me a lot of the time, though she says she isn't mad most of the time. Every time she gets into these moods/crying fits I spend hours trying to talk her down, to relieve the problem or at least keep her from crying. Most of the time I just reinforce that I love her and that she doesn't need to worry, and that works after long laborious reiterations of the same thing. I can deal with this on occasion but over the course of three years she has been in these moods nearly 3 nights a week, every week. Of course, there are some weeks here and there that she is in a great mood and everything seems to be going great, and those are the weeks that hold us together. But more often than not we have a bad week. Her anxiety is so high that she is always worried about literally everything that I say or that she says. I've asked her before if she would possibly see a therapist or think about getting on anti-aniety drugs but she sort of waved off the idea. When in the car she screams and swears at all the other drivers or the red lights, usually there is nothing out of the ordinary for a normal day of driving. I almost never hear her being positive and that is making me feel as if everything, including our relationship, is negative for her.

I find that my enjoyment of life is diminished when I'm around her when she's in these moods. Like I said, every once in a while is completely understandable but 3 or so nights a week is getting to be more than I can handle. I feel depressed when she's like this. I am losing the ability to feel sympathetic to her problems, and in fact I get angry now when I see that she is getting upset at something. I try to hide that kind of resentment for her problems but she is picking up on it and it seems to make our problems even worse.

I'm planning to propose to my GF on Valentine's Day.  However when discussing the proposal with a friend of mine he suggested that proposing on Valentine's Day was ""cliche"" and I should pick a different date.  Do you agree?

Second question.  I've been reading for months about romantic proposal ideas but to be honest much of what I've read just seems unrealistic and sounds good in theory but difficult/impossible/cheesy to actually pull off.  So my second question is, how were you proposed to OR what does your dream proposal look like?

**EDIT: #1**

A few people have asked.  The ring is a custom designed ring that will be finished this week.  It is a total of 2 carots.  Here is a CAD rendering of the basic design.

I'm getting a lot of PM's asking about who designed the ring and how much it cost.  I don't really want to go into details about cost but I will give a link to the jeweler.  For the record I have no affiliation w/her other than after tons of research I decided she was the best for what I wanted.

EDIT: After reading your responses, my views have changed. I believe it impossible for me, as a man, to not objectify the women I see. My first action upon seeing a woman is to size her up for sex. Its a purely biological instinct that I cannot repress. In that sense, objectification is impossible. However, im able to move past that bestial instinct by recognizing her personhood. She isn't just a sex object; she's a person. The only issue that arises is when one is unable to move past that bestial instinct.

We've talked about it, and I asked her if she wants to keep dating me even though there is an end in sight. She said yes.

If you read my post to /r/relationship_advice, I ended up trying to tell her how I felt and trying to ease her mind. I was right- she felt awful about being too busy to go on the date I had planned (we still hang out often- we're next door neighbors). 

I kind of stumbled through saying it in person (I'm shy and it's hard for me to express my feelings sometimes), so I decided to re-say it more clearly in a written message. Here's the response I got back:

&gt;________,
You have to be one of the kindess most thoughtful people I've ever met and I really mean that. I appreciate your care and concern. And you're right, I'm always aprehensive about dating because like I said earlier, I want to be able to provide equal balance in a relationship and I guess part of me is afraid that I can't do that until I settle down... the problem with that is, I never settle down. And you would never offend me, I appreciate the open dialogue. It makes it a lot easier than trying to guess. And you will no doubt find a girl that you'll have an awesome relationship with because your kindness is so hard to find these days... We both have a hard year ahead of us that's for sure..



That should give you some background and understanding of our relationship.

Anyways- I'd really like to have sex with her- but more than that, she's the woman I want to be my first. We've got a date planned for tomorrow, and I'm thinking of kissing her a bit more than usual and letting her know how I feel.

We all go out together on the weekends. She's 2 years older, and with an on again off again boyfriend. Thought of her just as a friend before all of this happened, and so I never pursued her or tried to impress her. Was just myself around her, and treated her like one of the guys.

A month ago we all go out to the club and me and her end up hooking up. We danced together and she stole a kiss from me. I tried to pull away because she has a boyfriend (I even reminded her), but she kept pulling me towards her. She would hold hands and kiss my neck and put her arm in mine. She treated me like I was her boyfriend, and I fell for her pretty hard that night. She told me how much she trusted me and we just kinda held each other all night. Closest thing to romance I've ever had in my life.

The next night she says she was too drunk to remember anything that happened, and so I act as though nothing happened at all. I stayed away from her from then on and didn't see her until the next weekend. 

From then on the entire dynamic of our friendship changed. We would only see each other when we went out to the club or bars, but inevitably me and this girl would go and find a corner and talk and flirt. She was very touchy, putting her arm in mine sometimes, or resting her head on mine. She would put her arm in the small of my back, and look deep into my eyes when we would talk. She would call me her favorite boy or announce to all our friends that I was her life partner. 

I never made a move because she had a boyfriend, but she began hinting to me that he and her were on a break. However, she went away one weekend, and I went home the next. We ended up not seeing each other for more than two weeks, and so I decided next time that I see her I would ask her out or at least tell her how I felt.

So I go to this party and see her there. She's real excited to see me, and we laugh and joke. She asks me to go downtown with her the next night and I say yes. I try to get her number but she changes the subject. She is still very flirty and touchy with me though, and I try to be as much with her. We dance a little, and then I back off and go to one end of the dance floor. She goes to the other end and looks at me hard before motioning for us to go outside.

I'm thinking this is my chance to talk to her, but when we go out some drunk guy begins talking to her nonstop and so I'm kind've stuck waiting beside her for like 10 minutes. She starts to ask me what I'm doing for Halloween before this guy cuts her off. When we're outside she's putting her arm in my arm, and resting her head on my shoulder for a little bit. It's like she steals these touches. She even touches my leg for a moment when we're sitting down talking.

I ask her if we can talk in private, and suddenly I'm feeling like a little boy. I nervously ask if she's still with her boyfriend (Yes... No... Kinda), before I ask her out. She says she's not a girl you take out. She says she tries to separate friends and dating and that she's too much for me. She's just kind've standing there shaking her head no at me, and I'm sitting down in shock pretty much. She's making excuses why she'd be a bad girlfriend (she says she travels). Eventually I'm just like, fine we'll just be friends. She agrees and we go back to our friends.

She tries to leave the party without saying goodbye but I get her to hug me. Its a real tight hug and she's resting her head on mine. After all of that I went and danced with some other girl to blow off some steam and she saw and might've gotten jealous.

Next day I see her it's a group situation and she's rather cold towards me. So I just bug out after a couple hours.

I was wondering, for you ladies, what is it like seeing a guy friend's dick in a non- overtly sexual setting, such as skinny dipping or streaking with friends? I ask because situations like these have been discussed with my friends. Strip poker, skinny dipping, truth or dare...these are all forms where you or your friends could end up naked. And you'd probably see. 

Maybe part of this stems from size insecurity. I'm not really all that insecure about my size (anymore), but I'm still curious. Do you note a guy's size? Do you try to avoid seeing it altogether?

Thanks!

Edit: So this is the impression I'm getting: For women, when seeing a guy friend's flaccid penis, it may have a slight sexual overtone, but it's basically just seeing an organ that you rarely/never on a guy, and it's really not that heavily sexualized, and kinda funny.

EDITS/UPDATE

Greetings /r/AskWomen!!!
First off, I would like to extend a very special thank you to the mods for handling the 'Stormfront' situation with extreme grace, and speed. Never once did receive or see any negative comments or messages from them. So, you all rock to the core! 

I never expected this to take off like it did, so let me shed some light on myself, and anything that comes to mind to give you a better view of myself. 

I, am a 20 year old 5'10'', 250 lb black guy. My favorite bands are Pierce The Veil, Memphis May Fire, Modest Mouse off the top of my head. My hobbies are longboarding (shoutout to /r/longboarding) video games, reading (just started World War Z, in the middle of Brad Thor's Full Black), martial arts, and music. I do work and have my own car, but it's a shitty dead end job and I will know within the week of if get this new job I'm going for (911 Operator). Multiple people have asked me if I've tried dating sites, and I am on both OKcupid and Plenty Of Fish. I even tried craigslist occasionally. I appreciate all the kind words and encouragement and although there was A TON of arguing in the comments, I do hope everyone only meant the best, as race is a very sensitive situation.

As for those in 'Stormfront', I'm not a religious man, but that's okay, because God loves you anyway :D This is for you =] (yes that is me)

Some have preferred that I do it rather lightly, while others expressed desires for violent levels of force. I've received requests like this from about 1 out of every 2 women I've slept with, making it the single most common sexual act that women have explicitly requested of me by an order of magnitude. 


What is the appeal in this? Neither giving nor receiving violence gives me any gratification aside from the joy in witnessing the pleasure that it provides my partners. What they get from it is a mystery to me, and I'd appreciate any insights. To be clear, I think that I have seen a diverse sample of women rather than a narrow representation who are drawn to me based on a specific factor. In other words, I'm a kind and peaceful man, intellectual and goofy, never been in a fight in my life. Violence and aggressive behavior play no significant roles in my life or my language. And these are women that I've met in all sorts of places and situations; it's not like I hang around outside roller derby practice and biker bars and try to pick up dates. This has also been a consistent experience since I was 18 until now, a decade later.


So, what's with all the choking and slapping and hair pulling? Do men request this of you?

**EDIT** - Two points of clarification

- With a couple exceptions, none of these women expressed interest in or knowledge about any BDSM play aside from the activities I've described. And yes, I agree that choking is too dangerous for an amateur like myself to toy around with. ""Varsity level,' as Dan Savage would say. I'll gently grasp around the muscles on the sides of their neck but use very little pressure and avoid the trachea entirely. This is out of my league and I treat it as such. 

- When I used the terms 'sample' and 'representation' it was only to express my point that I don't consider myself a man who attracts or is attracted to any narrow 'type' of women, or specifically those who are particularly drawn to BDSM/aggression/violence/whatever else motivates such desires. In no way do I consider past partners mere numbers. Some I never really got to know, but most are dear individuals with whom I've maintained meaningful friendships.

Yes, I have brought it up with him.

I worked at a restaurant that my mom managed, and I was sitting down for a break, near the front of the store.

There was a homeless man in the area that I'd seen a few times, and he seemed to hang mostly around the general area that our restaurant was in. He came in during my break, and slowly made his way to the counter. He was dirty, with a white beard and sad face. It looked like he was trying to make himself look as small as possible as he walked. Anyway, there was a man I worked with - Tommy. One of the nicest guys I've ever met. He looked up from the food he was making, and asked the man what he could do for him. The man very quietly said ""I need something to eat."" Tommy kinda stared at him for a second, I'm guessing trying to get a read on the guy, and he smiled and said, ""No problem, have a seat and I'll be right with you."" Tommy then got a huge paper bag (the kind you would get at the grocery store) and filled it with all kinds of breads, sliced meats, cheese, some desserts, some premade sandwiches, fries, anything he could find that would fit. He also gave the man a huge to-go cup of Coke. He came out with the huge bag and the soda, and the homeless man looked like he was going to cry. Tommy told him to come back whenever he needed to. The man thanked him quietly and left with his bag of food. I've never forgotten that.

I really hope this is the right subreddit for something like this, but here goes. I grew up as an extremely ""well behaved"" Christian girl, but in the past few years I've been slowly losing my religion. Now that there's nothing really holding me back from delving into the world of sex, though, I'm at a bit of loss as to how to proceed. I can't ask my parents or relatives about anything as they're still very devout Christians, and all of my friends, religious and non-religious eschew sex topics for various reasons. And I don't trust Google. So TL;DR I have a lot of questions, and would really appreciate it if y'all could answer some of them. Thanks a ton, and sorry if I come across as a total sex n00b! Because I am. :)

* **Porn**: what kind of porn do most women enjoy and where can I find this? I've seen a few James Deen videos; they're pretty awesome, but still pretty male-oriented imho.
* **Tampons**: Not directly related to sex, but...my mom thinks tampons will cause girls to lose their virginity, which means I only tried them very recently. I stupidly tried inserting one off-period for experimental purposes and had a pretty painful experience taking it out, obviously. When I tried inserting one during my period, it just wouldn't go in completely (smallest size). Might be psychological, I wouldn't know. And then it really started hurting and I nearly fainted - recovering from that took a good number of minutes. I'm not sure why - is it possible to insert a tampon ""the wrong way""? Should I see a doctor about this? :/
* **Masturbating**: How does one do this properly? Some articles I've read recommend sticking a finger in but I've only ever been able to get half a pinky in before chickening out (perhaps related to the section above, heh).
* **Orgasming**: Don't think I've ever experienced one (at least not from my pitiful attempts at masturbation). I'd really like to. Which brings me to:
* **Sex toys**: I'll be honest - I barely know anything about these at all. Should I invest in a sex toy to assist with my dastardly masturbation plans? What do you ~~guys~~ ladies use? A vibrator sounds like fun but I wouldn't know. There's also the small problem that I'm a college student with no means of transportation (not to mention I'm far too embarrassed to walk into a sex-toy store, whatever they're called). Gah.
* **Sex**: It seems from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/13xj9w/how_old_is_too_old_to_be_a_virgin/) that while many women do not think virginity is necessarily a problem, a good number of women think that there is an upper limit after which ""normal people"" should no longer be virgins. However, I think it would be easier if I were more comfortable with myself and mastered the above points before having actual sex. Am I being too analytical about this? Does sex just come naturally or something?

Many questions (that reveal my complete lack of understanding of sex), many of them too embarrassing to post on my main account. Thank you so much for your help, and sorry for the wall of text!

I have been trying to be okay with this, but it's bothering me. What should I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/wed6x/my_girlfriend_doesnt_want_to_manage_her_facial/)

Not sure if this warrants a follow-up or not, but I saw a topic similar to mine a while ago that didn't have one and that made me sad - so: The Results...

I spoke with her last night intent on getting to the bottom of things. At the end of the conversation I was either going to convince her there's no negative aspect of waxing aside from maybe some temporary stinging - OR I was going to drop it for good.

I (subtly) buttered her up for the day/evening, my main goal for her to be aware of the fact that I think she is gorgeous (because she is, probably too hot for me) and that I love her very much and enjoy the time we spend together. And then, after dinner and drinks, we went back to my place and talked a bit. That's when I brought it up. 

I started off explaining the differences between shaving and waxing, and why it is a common misconception that the hair will grow back thicker. She didn't really want to talk about it, and I came off a bit **too concerned** to her. I asked her if she understood that she's not risking growing a beard by waxing her upper lip, and she confirmed. I asked her if she really understood this, then why did she not want to do it? She replied that it doesn't bother her, she's okay with it, and I should be too. She asked me if I really wanted her to take care of it, and I (honestly) replied yes, but also insisted that she is beautiful regardless, and that she doesn't have to do anything she isn't comfortable with. 

She said she would do it, if it would make me happy. I thanked her and offered to buy her a day at the spa as ~~an award~~ a way to say thanks. She said she didn't want it, just the wax, but she wanted me to go with her (she didn't want to go alone) and she wanted a good lunch afterwards. 

So, everything went better than expected.

 At college, I was in a triple that had these *huuuugeee* wall windows in them.

At some point I turn around and see that he's shivering. He gave me his hoodie and sat in the cold so I could be warm. Nothing ever really happened between us (we only saw each other a few times after that) but I still consider it one of the sweetest things a boy has done for me.

For some reason, I can't stop thinking about having sex with one of my platonic girlfriends. We're both very busy people, she (F23) is in college full time and works, I (M25) work two jobs at 60+ hours a week. Neither of us have time for a relationship right now, and I'm not sure we would be good in a committed relationship anyway. 


However, I do think we would be good FWB for several reasons:


First, we have good chemistry together. We are both touchy-feely with each other. We hug and peck on the lips whenever we see each other, and have cuddled several times. But nothing along the lines of sexy time.


Second, we are both good looking, hard working people. We each take care of our bodies, so why not enjoy them together? I'm 6'3"", she's 5'8"" and even when we hug, we definitely 'fit' together well. 


Third, we trust each other. This is obviously the most important thing in any relationship, FWB or otherwise. 


Now I'm stuck on how the hell you ask someone if they want to become FWB. I absolutely do not want to have sex with her without her knowing that we have a FWB situation worked out, because I'm afraid she would develop feelings for me. 


So, how the hell do you go about asking someone this? I've never been in this position before I've had sex with someone. Previous relationships just kind of turned into FWB. I'm thinking face-to-face, this isn't really something you should text another human about. Also, should I mention an STD check or anything? I'm clean and I'm 99% sure she is, but you can't be too careful. I also don't want our current relationship to be ruined if she says no. I'm not worried about it being awkward, I just don't want her to be mad at me if this doesn't work out. 


How do you suggest I go about this? 
How would you prefer a male friend to ask you? 
What should my backup plan be to save our friendship if she says 'no'?


All advice is appreciated!


TL;DR - How do you ask a platonic friend if they want to become FWB without pissing them off?

I called her about an hour ago with the sole mission of making it clear to her that it was over. 

The gist of the conversation was this: I told her that I wasn't going to show up to the date we had previously scheduled for Wednesday. I expected her to deflect this or try to change the subject, but she was just silent. I took this opportunity to continue and explain exactly why I was breaking up with her, and because I'm a pushover I sprinkled it with shit like ""There's a better match for you out there"" and ""You'd be wasting your time with me anyway"". I don't even know. I was talking out of my ass by that point.

She still says nothing. I decide to just wait for her to respond. Finally, I hear her crying softly. Now I feel as guilty as if I had just kicked a puppy but I stick to the plan and say ""I'm sorry. It just has to be this way."" (Cliche as hell, I know.)

A few more seconds of quiet crying before she whispers ""Please."" 

Goddammit. I'm not proud, but I just hung up right then and there. I figured she would try to guilt me into apologizing, maybe even backtracking entirely. I didn't want to put up with it. As much as I hated to do it, I decided to be the bad guy. If that's what she needed in order to consider me an ex-boyfriend, then so be it.

I'm an involved single father. I've done: ""tee ball coach"", ""scout leader"", PTO member, band booster, field trip chaperone and driver, and have always made sure to know my daughter's friends and their parents. I'm honest and open: when my daughter asked me if there really was a Santa Claus, I said, ""do you want to know the truth for sure? sometimes the truth can be different from what you expect,"" and then told her the truth even though it was a painful moment. I've even given her advice on her love life, up to and including how to improve her - ahem - good times without bruising the fragile male ego. 

As she's moved into high school, there's that gap that opens up, and inadvertently (and in some cases intentionally), I've become friends with some of her friends on FaceBook. Most of them are teen girls, but some of them are teen boys.

I don't message them and rarely post on their pages, but I like the pictures that come up in my daughter's feeds when she's in them, and make little jokes (like sharing the orrrgrrrnc blurrrbrrreez and birthday skeleton pics on her page).

Is this in any way creepy? As a single father I've already gone through having to have female coworkers at birthday parties and friends who can't spend the night because there won't be a woman there. I don't want to be creeper dad.

To be clear, I know I'm not creepy myself. But I'm curious how women young and old view this. Thank you! (P.S. I'm in my early 40s)

Edit: the intentional friending mentioned above is when my daughter has a friend who I know well socially because they have hung out at our house, and have parents who are ... scary, shall we say? I've been asked to let them shelter at my house before. I feel this might give me a heads up if something bad is happening to them, because I do care.

Edit 2: My daughter says it's not creepy, but I feel I need more input. Also, I BELIEVE I'm not creepy. I can't say I know, because you lot might say I totally am.

Most agree it's better if they friend me, rather than me friending them. A smaller percentage felt just having a parent as a friend was creepy in itself, and indicative of possible smothering and/or helicoptering. And most interestingly, the non-parents were the ones who seemed most disturbed by the idea. I'm chalking that up to the fact that every parent I know has expressed to me at one point or another, being a parent changed how they felt about certain things. But I don't really know. Once again, ladies, I appreciate your kindness in talking to me. And you too, the gentlemen who chimed in.

I had an abortion over a year ago, and am currently in a human sexuality class.

From the minute I knew i was pregnant, I knew i was going to have an abortion. I never waivered, and didn't really think much about it afterword, besides the day after, and the week i would have been due. I only cried once about it, and that was only because i went to work the day after, some customers were rude to me, and i couldn't handle it because my hormones were ravaging my body still. But other than that it didn't really effect me.

I didn't care about what happened, because it shouldn't have happened.

But now, i'm in a human sexuality class and we're discussing pregnancy and she keeps asking the class who has been pregnant, what it was like for them.

I just sit here, keep my hand down and my eyes lowered. I don't want them to identify me as the girl who had an abortion. But at the same time, i want to talk about my pregnancy and how it effected my body.

And i'm currently just sitting here in class, and she's talking about abortion, and how it effects girls

Just want to get some thoughts from you all.,Link68759,138,18,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10fuz2/im_a_21_year_old_guy_never_had_a_girlfriend_just/,"I've got a bit of a unique situation though. I've been told by girls that I'm attractive, and I used to be hit on by girls somewhat frequently (at very inconvenient times. Yes there were times in my life when girls were more of an annoying distraction, or rather I sought out a different maturity level than the girls asking after me, but I digress). I like the way I look too for the most part. [I'm fit, I used to be the captain of my crew team, stroke of the JV team and 4th seat of V (pulling double duty). I'm not freakishly musclebound... I'm only mentioning this to demonstrate that I am functioning perfectly fine, despite my injuries, detailed below.]

However, I'm also apparently terrifying, and the older I get the greater the effect. Since the 4th grade I've gotten comments from my peers that I look ""scary"", and to further compound this, several years ago I sustained an injury that gave me a zipper-scar running up my left leg, and cost me a good portion of my left forearm, which has been replaced with steel and carbon fiber. More than one of my female friends, whom I only met after getting what can only be described as a ""claw"", confessed to me that without knowing my personality, I am a very scary person. One friend said she ""nearly pissed [her] pants in fear"" the first time she saw me. And be it through fear, or just keeping a respectful distance, it doesn't matter where I am in the states, east coast, west coast: people avoid me on the street. And you know what? I'm fine with being a little feared. It can be fun, and most importantly people get out of my way when I'm on a mission, and I do enjoy the fact that while idiotic kids might harmlessly/verbally harass other people walking by their hangout, when I walk by: *complete silence*.
My presence seems to carry some weight, and even though I feel like I talk to much while amongst my guy friends, at least one of them has said to me that I seem to have more going on in my head than I let on. Whether or not that is true is irrelevant, what is relevant is I saw myself as a completely transparent jabbermouth the day he said that. I guess what I'm getting at is, I know I look scary, but apparently my demeanor isn't quite what I think it is, and it certainly seems to be compounding the scariness, even when I feel like I've more than dispelled any illusions of me being a scary person. I think part of the reason people are afraid of me is because my face isn't very expressive, and I ""appear as if always in deep thought, perhaps slightly annoyed"". I think that the illusion of me being pensive and annoyed makes people wonder what I'm thinking about, and since people fear what they don't know, for some reason people are afraid of me because they cannot tell what I am thinking.

But being feared has cost me romance. A guy might ignore any fear at the sight of me, but girls tend to stick to their gut instincts, and thus no girls approach me anymore. I am afraid to be spontaneous and ask out just any girl, because what must she think of me if I do this? On the off chance that she is not afraid of me, then she would see my injury and despite her best intentions, judge me by it, as it is one of my more distinguishing features and thus will be a big part of how she sees me in her mind's eye. If she is afraid of me, then who knows how she'll react to my pathetic attempts at flirting. Honestly, I'm really just a loving/caring guy, at least where girls are involved... and I have no one to give my affections to. 

I'm lonely, and tired, and I feel old. I want a girl who trusts me. I want a relationship, and I think that caring about someone will give me energy which I would use to make her happy. I don't know where to go from here.

Thanks for reading. If nothing else, it's good to get this off my chest and be heard.

1339181216.0,120,self.AskWomen,uryqq,"*UPDATE* My girlfriend absolutely does not want me going down on her, kind of at a loss for how to make sex more enjoyable for her.",gorbrant,132,12,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/uryqq/update_my_girlfriend_absolutely_does_not_want_me/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/u1gcz/my_girlfriend_absolutely_does_not_want_me_going/)

So, thought I'd share what came of the discussion I had here, and what I've learned from (what became sort of) the debacle. Also to express my thanks to you guys, who helped me approach the situation more delicately and thoughtfully than I would have. *Wall of text, sorry!*

Anyway, after posting here, when my girlfriend and I would have sex, I would make a point to compliment (this wasn't nearly as awkward as it was happening as it is typing this out haha) her vagina, and I'd kind of ask about her need to hide it from me. She would tell me that she thought it looked weird, or that it would smell funny, or what have you, and I'd alleviate her concerns without being pushy or turning the conversation down a particular path.

This sorta culminated in a disaster. I'd estimate that I'm in the mood and willing to have sex maybe 90% of the time (I can control myself, though), and she's willing maybe 15% of the time. Because of our wildly different libidos, I made the fatal mistake of jumping at the opportunity when she was in the mood and invited me to go down on her, despite this being probably the only time over the course of our relationship that she was in the mood and I just.... wasn't. I guess I didn't want to lose the opportunity.

Anyway, I was in the middle of the act, and she was enjoying it (and even giving me direction), and then she just really wanted to start having sex (though she was enjoying it, I learned through this process that although she doesn't climax often from penetration, if she's really in the mood, that seems to kinda be a requisite for her). This turned into me tearing the apartment inside out looking for a condom (she's not on the pill), and then having to get dressed and go outside to the car to grab some. This completely killed the mood for me, a mood that I kinda had to labor for to begin with. When I got back in, I continued where we left off to kinda recapture it, but try as I might, I just couldn't maintain an erection. This turned out to be extremely awkward.

I totally know I should have told her from the beginning that I wasn't really in the mood at the time, but saying it afterwards felt kinda disingenuous. She ended up getting bummed, and believed wholeheartedly that I was just turned off by her vagina.

Anyway, luckily, this segued into a really thoughtful discussion about our sex life. I managed to assure her that I was attracted to every part of her, and she explained to me that whether or not she felt comfortable with me going down on her didn't change the fact that she just prefers penetration. It'll get her warmed up, but it won't get her where she wants to be. We talked about other stuff, too, but that's all that's relevant to this topic (and I'm already talking your ears off!). The next day, we ended up having sex several times (which hasn't happened since the first few months of our relationship), and she finished every time.

So, this is everything I've learned from this experience, and whether or not you guys outright told me this, it was in taking your advice that I came to discover these things, so I wanted to say thanks:

**I was quantifying the value of an orgasm based on my experience as a man, instead of understanding it from a woman's perspective.** I never had trouble getting previous sexual partners off, so I never really thought about this idea in any detail. As a man, I enjoy the act of sex, but if I don't ""finish,"" then it's essentially a failure for me. My girlfriend enjoys the act of sex, and whether or not she climaxes doesn't devalue that experience for her at all.

**There's a dramatic difference between my girlfriend being willing to have sex, and being horny.** This goes without saying, but I've come to discover that if she's willing to have sex, she'll always enjoy it, but she'll *rarely* finish. When she's horny, it's actually insanely easy for me to bring her to orgasm. It just took me a while to really grasp this concept since when we first started dating, our sex life was a frenzy, but now we have sex much less frequently and it takes me longer to figure things out. I've also learned that giving pretty much every inch of her body equal attention, and making it much more blatantly obvious that I'm attracted to her, is a major turn on for her (major credit to alettuce for helping me realize that on my own).

Discovering these two things (along with a much longer list of smaller things) has honestly made sex so much more comfortable and enjoyable for both of us. I'm confident I can get her to finish when she can, and I'm confident that if she can't, it's still enjoyable for her. She's probably under less pressure now that I'm more comfortable with the situation (which is probably a big part of the reason it's been a lot easier for me to get her off recently).

Anyway, again, really wanted to thank you guys for jump-starting a dialogue between me and my girlfriend that culminated in an improved sexual experience, and thank you guys (whether it was your intent or not) for making me way more sexually self-aware and way more curious and thoughtful about the female sexual experience.

**tl;dr** GF allowed me to go down on her.

Only when I was hitting a specific spot with a lot of tongue pressure did he really like it.

Add to all that: he's got a bad case of performance anxiety and had trouble maintaining an erection. Reddit, I'm not that great in bed, and I just know this is going to be an epic disaster. But I like the guy and I want to make him happy. What do I do?

Greetings!

Now that our greetings are out of the way, I need to get something off of my chest...

*I have always felt odd about my sexual preferences... and I don't know HOW or WHEN to reveal them to a woman*

In case you are wondering what these sexual preferences are, well... I love when a woman has muscles... and I especially like it when she uses her strength to embarrass me.

Ummm... especially if she lifts me off my feet.

I guess it makes me feel a bit... inferior... and I love it.   =/

As best I can tell, it's a humiliation fetish that involves dominance and submission.  (I'm not fully submissive, however.  I'm probably 50/50.  And actually, I kind of enjoy using my strength to embarrass a woman a bit, too).

Now obviously, these things aren't ""normal""...

...and I have no idea when I should reveal them to a woman.

Should I tell her while while we are dating?

I'm a Christian dude and Christian women seem to be very loving people.  I suspect that most of them would gladly participate in my turn-ons in order to make me happy, even if they weren't fully into them.  (Just as I would do the very same thing for them).

But there is a part of me who fears that my future wife would not be into it at all... at which point our bedroom activities might become a bit of a struggle.  (I don't *need* my fetishes to be aroused, but I would prefer to have them).

On the other hand, telling a woman these things while I am still dating her seems pretty scary.  (I fear that she might totally reject me over it).

So... what's a ~~boy~~ man to do?

And if a guy told you these things after you married him, would you lovingly participate to make him happy?  Or would that pretty much be impossible for you?

EDIT:  Sometimes I wonder if I should just try to find my next girlfriend from an online *humiliation* fetish forum.  I don't think this is entirely a good idea, because it could make sex the center of our relationship... but at least it would get the elephant out of the room.   =P

There are some parts of my life that she's not in to, though - I'm very athletic and outdoorsy, she isn't, and isn't interested in pursuing those activities with me.

I also have a shortage of friends right now. I have a few surface acquaintances from work. I'm buddies with one guy locally, but we don't get to see each other that often. My other friends are all in different cities. It feels a little weird leaning on my fiancée in almost every instance that I need to talk to someone. 

I've run into a girl a few times at a party that seems bright and is interested in the same sort of outdoor pursuits than I am. She was briefly involved with an ex-roommate of mine so we vaguely know each other, although said ex-roommate did not play nice with others and may have previously complained about me in her presence. 

So, I'm not sure if she's interested in being friends with me, but I have enjoyed what talks we've had together, and I'd like to hang out with her more so I'm not always alone on hikes and runs and bike rides.

I don't know how to handle things without rocking the boat. I'd like to hang out with this girl sometime, but I don't my fiancée to think I'm interested in her or intending to cheat (my fiancée can be somewhat insecure and jealous). I also don't want the girl to think I'm interested in leaving or being disloyal to my fiancée.

She didn't know it was *not* her boyfriend, given her mental state, and when she asked the boy the next morning, she was apparently sobbing her boyfriend's name while this guy was in her.

So she blames herself and thinks she's a horrible person and has been crying for days, and I'm obviously in complete disagreement.

Edit: Thanks for the thoughts and opinions. I know I'm only relating the story as a third party, and that I don't have (and haven't given) all of the details, but I'll add a few things to clear it up.

-The guy was not as drunk as she, nor did he smoke. He informed her of the details in the morning when she asked. (that they had sex, she wanted it, was sobbing the whole time, crying her recently ex-boyfriend's name during the act.) I know him pretty well, she dated his older brother (who cheated on her the whole time)

-She had never had sex with a guy other than her boyfriend

-For those of you suggesting therapy, she's terrified of them, so that's another issue.

-The ex-boyfriend only knows they had sex, not the rest of details.

-I am the only one that she has told the details to.

All parties are mid-to-late twenties.

My GF and I have mostly mutual friends. I've made a concerted effort in our time together to endear myself to the few friends she has that I wasn't previously friends with. Over time, I developed a really strong rapport with her best friend. The three of us will hang out frequently, spend the night at each others places, etc etc. It became common enough that if my GF or I had something to take care of while we were all hanging out, the other would continue to hang out with her. After a few awkward times like this where, if I was with her, we'd sit in silence and watch TV, we eventually opened up and got comfortable with each other.

In the past, my GF expressed a twinge of jealousy, because in all honesty, her friend is extremely physically attractive. I totally assuaged her fears, I made it clear, in absolutely no uncertain terms, that I had never and absolutely would never think of her romantically. I enjoy lounging with her, but I've learned to bite my tongue and quickly change the subject because of pretty tremendous differences in personal beliefs (nothing like religion or anything, just social and personal issues). Deep down, I honestly think she's kind of a scumbag, but when we keep things totally surface-y, it's totally pleasant.

Anyway, yeah, I'm getting away from the point. Yesterday we were all hanging out, my GF got a call that was gonna keep her away for the majority of the day, and it was just me and her friend. We were talking for a while, and she seemed distracted. I asked her what was wrong, and then... yeah. She told me that she has ""strong"" feelings for me, but that she'd never pursue them because she loves my girlfriend, and she knows that I do as well. She essentially said she just had to air her feelings and that she'd let it go. I blurted something out about being flattered but being head over heels in love with my girlfriend, and we awkwardly said goodbye and she left.

I totally get that I need to keep a hefty amount of distance from this girl now. I have no qualms finding friends to hang out with when she's around (I don't know how long that'll have to go on for, though. She's attractive, she could find some other guy easily enough, but she's essentially a hermit. My GF is basically her only friend at this point).

My problem is how I approach this with my GF. It seems like a no-brainer that I tell her, but I just wanna be delicate. One of my major personal issues with her friend was always that she would never, ever be to my GF what my GF is to her. My girlfriend would leap through hoops of fire for her friends, and this girl wouldn't. This just seems like another instance of.... I don't know if ""betrayal"" is too strong of a word. I just feel.... angry, and sad.

Beyond how I might feel if one of my friends expressed an interest in my girlfriend without telling *me* about it, I just feel like this could cause irreparable harm to their friendship, and I seriously think that would devastate my GF. Maybe I'm just overstating the whole scenario, but I can't shake this feeling that ""she deserves better."" But these two have been friends for over a decade now.

I'm sorta all over the place. I'm confounded why her friend would tell me this at all, and not just distance herself from me and get over it before it progressed to this point (I enjoyed the three of us hanging out, but I've never been offended by ""girl time""). I feel like, even if I were to just keep quiet about it and do the distancing myself, if my GF found out about this from anyone other than me, she'd feel like I was keeping it from her for some ulterior motive.

Bah! Sorry, I'll shut up now, just need some advice.

She was also very jealous and would often look up my exes on FB (even going so far as to message one of them once to discuss me). She also went through my FB messages (as well as my texts) in an effort to find out if I were cheating (I wasn't).

That whole ordeal left me with an especially negative view on Facebook in particular. After she and I broke up, I began the process of blocking her and her friends, but then decided to just pull the plug on FB altogether.

If you can control them, do you do them deliberately because it betters the experience for you? Do you do them on purpose because some boys want to hear it? Do you moan when you masturbate?

As mentioned in a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10wh66/faq_you_buddy/) about the FAQs, we will be posting a question every few days and asking you guys to give us your answer for it. The best answers will be used in the actual FAQ.

**Today's question is: ""How do I avoid the 'friend zone'?"" AND/OR ""What's wrong with referring to the 'friend zone'?""**

Some ideas for how to answer include the more specific questions of ""Does the friend zone exist for women?"", ""Is there a way to make women see me as more than a friend?"", ""Have you ever had a relationship with someone you originally friend-zoned?"" and ""Is the concept of 'friend zone' sexist?"". Basically **answer any question about 'friendzoning' you can think of**.

**Some past posts on this topic:**

- [What will surely make you friendzone someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/nz7qx/what_will_surely_make_you_friendzone_someone/)
- [Dear Ladies of AskWomen, I have read in several threads now that the ""Friendzone"" is a male fabrication and doesn't actually exist in woman's minds. How do you view your male friends then?

- [Ladies... Just simple question... How to avoid becoming ""Friendzoned""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/wspvx/ladies_just_simple_question_how_to_avoid_becoming/)

Also, **these posts will be heavily moderated** which means there will be zero tolerance for anyone breaking the subreddit's rules (see the sidebar/info button for reference) and that any derailment from the topic question will be removed. Discussing the topic is totally fine, but keep it clean and friendly and female-focussed, folks!

Also as I'm OP and a mod who is going out with someone I met and was friends with for five years, I won't tolerate anyone accusing women of lying about considering their friends as love interests. (#justsayin)

Going to add a little bit more context for those who asked for it.  My wife is in her late twenties (I'm in my early 30s), she's a college grade (BS in Business Administration: HR) in an industry many people try very hard to get into (I wont say which because things get around quickly in this industry).  As far as spoiling her, we spoil each other as its all our money we don't really draw a line between who's is who's and to be honest I'm way more spoiled then her.

Like I said in my first post we had been talking on and off very off the cuff about this for awhile so finally sat down with her the night after posting this and tried to get out what was really going on with this sudden change.  It looks like its a combination of jealous that I don't have to commute to often (I have to go see my clients and meet with my business partner or employees from time to time but mainly I work from home), her own commute (a little over an hour each way), and her just not being challenged at work enough (this one I don't get as I don't see how not working would be more challenging).  After talking it through she's going to look for another job (probably in a new industry as there is nothing in her current industry any close to home) closer to home that will challenge her a little bit more. We also had the kid talk again, that's a whole other story for another thread as we're still a little unsure there when we want to have them or if we want to.

1376272507.0,110,self.AskWomen,1k6gyd,"Have you ever willingly had sex with someone to ""avoid"" rape?",misspelledusermane,220,110,425,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1k6gyd/have_you_ever_willingly_had_sex_with_someone_to/,"Have you ever had sex with someone to ""avoid"" rape?

My girlfriend and I had a conversation the other day that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. She was telling me about her previous job as a waitress. The bosses apparently had sex with many of the waitresses. She wondered why none of bosses ever propositioned her for sex. Here's how the conversation went.

Me: Well if one of your bosses had asked you for sex, would you have done it?

Her: Nooo. No no no. Well maybe. It depends on the situation.

Me: What do you mean?

Her: Well if I was feeling threatened and I felt like the situation might turn bad, then I might do it.


That blew my mind. She was basically saying she would have sex with someone to ""avoid"" being raped. We had a long conversation, emotional conversation. Long story short: I thought less of her for that and thought it revealed she had a ""weak personality."" She thought that I shouldn't be judgemental since I've never been in that situation and people in panic-mode make stupid decisions. I agreed to reserve judgement.

She also revealed that when she was younger, she was in more than one situation where this happened to her.

In the first, she was hanging out with a guy for several months. One day, they were hanging out in his truck, and she mentioned that she had lost her virginity to a friend. He said ""We should have sex."" She felt threatened (although she admits that had she said no, the guy might have backed off,) and willingly said yes and had sex with him. She also had sex with him at a later date. She convinced herself that she wanted it and didn't realize she didn't till our talk yesterday.

In the second scenario, she asked a guy to give her a ride home and promised him cookies in return. He said yes, and jokingly asked what else he could get in return. She jokingly said she would blow him. A few days later, he asks her if he could take her up on that offer. She felt panicked, and gave him a blowjob, even though she says that he was a nice guy and wouldn't have forced anything on her had she said no.

There were other situations in which she said she might have done the same had the circumstances been different. She said she'd rather have ""consensual"" sex to avoid the pain of a rape (she can tell someone to slow down in consensual sex.)

I honestly can't wrap my head around it. I'm not a female, and I don't know how I would actually react in a situation like that, but I feel strongly that I would never have sex with someone just to calm them down or avoid a worse situation. I have too much self-respect for that. Again, I'm reserving judgement because it's unfair of me to judge. I just don't understand it at all. I'm curious to hear other women's input. Can anyone here relate?

TLDR - GF has and would willingly have sex if she feels threatened in order to ""avoid"" rape.

EDIT - My GF has seen this post and is fine with the way it's worded. No details are left out that she thinks are important. Also, in response to some of the comments about the 2 guys in those situations - neither of them was threatening in any way, and she agrees that looking back, neither of them would have raped her had she said no. She felt threatened though for whatever reason and felt like having sex was her best option.

EDIT 2 - Holy shit. This thread blew up way more than I expected. Let me just clarify one thing. The scenarios that my girlfriend was in were **NOT** rape. She gave consent. Both those guys would have been completely fine with a ""no."" Had they coerced her in a any way, then an argument could be made that it was rape, and the answer would depend on the circumstances. That is not what happened though. Both guys asked for sex. Neither were threatening. My GF felt threatened for reasons *other* than the way they asked/were acting. She decided to have sex with them. If you want to argue over whether or not that was the right decision, then go ahead. A lot of this thread seems to be questioning whether or not these situations were rape or not. They weren't.

I don't understand this, because (as a housewife myself) I've never wanted to make it seem like not choosing to be a housewife was wrong or bad. I'm glad we as women have the right to choose any career we want... but shouldn't we have the right to choose to not have a career too? (Assuming that you have the financial option to do so.) 

I just don't know why women try to keep other women from doing what they want to do with their lives- isn't that the real point of the women's lib movement? The right to choose?!

**Today's question is: ""Honestly now: Does penis size matter?""**

Some ideas for how to answer include the more specific questions of ""Would you turn down a guy who had a small penis on a one-night-stand?"", ""How big is too big?"", ""Do any of you have troubles having sex with a small/large penis?"", ""Can a small penis be satisfying?"", ""Would you reconsider a relationship with a guy due to his penis size?"" etc.

Also, **these posts will be heavily moderated** which means there will be zero tolerance for anyone breaking the subreddit's rules (see the sidebar/info button for reference) and that any derailment from the topic question will be removed. Discussing the topic is totally fine, but keep it clean and friendly and female-focussed, folks!

What makes the difference between inexperienced or all right and brings it to the next level? While there are going to be differences and personal preferences it helps when you give illustrations and examples of those opinions.

Here is some of the advice given in the last post (to name but a few).

* From ""suzepie"":
You wanna get me off? Start off by avoiding my clit. Avoid my pussy 
completely. Touch everything else. Touch my neck, my inner arms, my 
thighs, my ass. Stroke my hair. Kiss me lightly, kiss me deeply. 
Kiss my stomach. Kiss the small of my back. Very lightly touch my 
breasts. Do it till my nipples are hard. Touch the area just around 
them. Avoid the actual nipple for a while, then lick it very 
gently. Do not slobber or mash down on my breast while you do so. 
Take the nipple in your teeth, but don't hurt me. Then give it a 
flick with your tongue. Go back to the touching and kissing. If you 
can keep this up for, say, fifteen minutes, I will be begging you 
to touch my pussy. Begging you to enter me. Think of it like this: 
You don't excite the clit and/or vagina by touching it. You excite 
it by doing all this other stuff, which prepares and engorges it. 
You whet its appetite by making all these other sensual promises, 
all over the body. It gets jealous. It wants some, too. It starts 
to prepare itself for its turn. And then, when it's ready, every 
little sensation down there will be amplified tenfold. The feeling 
of penetration will be godlike. The orgasms will come so much more 
easily. TL;DR: Don't go straight for the goods. Do the opposite. 
(At least for this woman.) 


* Redditor ""poesie"" posted the following recommendation.  
Read ""She Comes First."" I had a really inexperienced guy blow my 
frickin' mind; I found out he read that book. I looked it over and 
it was awesome. Books are a great resource.

Sorry for the incoming wall of text.

Just as a background, I have had problems with my sexuality since I was a young child. I was raised mostly by my two sisters since my father passed away when I was young and my mother was constantly working to support us. I went to a religious school who really didn't teach anything about sex ed aside from that sex was supposed to between married people and anything else was a sin. I didn't quite figure out what masturbation was until I was 14, at which point my eldest sister caught me in the act and basically beat the shit out of me and told me how I was disgusting and that mom would hate me and blah blah all this other shit.

I basically from then on out repressed all sexual urges until I was 18, and I was just a generally awkward and troubled child with no friends. I joined the Army and was in for 4 years, long story short my kind of weird past came up soon after arriving at my first unit and while I was the butt-end of many, many jokes I learned jerking it was perfectly normal and not to be ashamed of myself. Like right before I got out one of my bosses told me he knew of an escort service that could help me kind of get over that first hump, so to speak, but I declined because that wasn't how I wanted it to happen.

Once I separated from active duty I started going to school at 22 and it's been about a year since then and I've been on a few dates, but whenever I come close to getting intimate I feel the need to mention the fact that it is my first time. I don't bring up my childhood or the reasons behind my previous lack of intimacy, I generally just kind of drop it and leave it.

The first time I had been on a couple of dates with this girl I met in one of my classes and she invited me over via text with the express purpose of ""watching the opening credits of a movie"" with her and told me to pick up condoms on the way. Now, I kind of got the jitters and told her via text that I was a virgin, and she basically just told me nevermind about the movie and not to come over and we stopped talking after that. Yeah, that was an awkward class for the rest of the year, but I figured maybe she got freaked out because I did it over text.

So a couple of months later I'm being undressed by this girl I like, she grabs some rubbers from her desk at which point I just kind of casually mention that it will be my first time. She just laughed at me, and when I asked what was so funny she just said something about how she had misjudged me so bad and that she almost slept with a loser.

The third at least let me down easy, she basically just told me she wasn't looking to be with someone who was sexually inexperienced at this point in time but that I was a ""good person"".

I'm starting to think I should just not say anything next time and get it out of the way and let my poor performance speak for itself, but frankly these 3 incidents have almost completely killed my confidence. I've seen on the internet a lot about how 23 isn't THAT abnormal to be a virgin, but real life appears to be a bit of a different story. I wasn't in a hurry to get laid or anything, these were just girls that I liked and was hoping to be intimate with at some point, but since then any time I try and talk to someone I'm even remotely interested in, be it purely physical or something more than that I quickly shoot myself in the foot and I'm getting a tad bit anxious.

So, what do you think? Just keep my mouth shut and let it happen or keep trying the way I've been going?",,True,,t5_2rxrw,False,,,True,t3_1il8f1,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1il8f1/should_i_stop_telling_women_about_me_being_a/,

So naturally I fucked him. Turns out he doesn't only have a nice big BEAUTIFUL dick but he also is a deviant god. So fucking dominant. He knows how to do bondage properly and beautifully, he takes his time fucking me... I mean dude, you have no idea how hard it is to find that combo. And he finds me attractive. Like awesome right? Well...I dunno. I Mean HES JUST SOOOOO HOLLYWOOD. That's the best way I can describe it. Here, I'll tell you about a bunch of things he does that really shouldn't happen in real life:


**(1)** Usually before or after we fuck he looks at me up and down while I'm naked, stares at me deeply and says ""You're beautiful you know that?"" or ""You're so fucking beautiful"". Now... I get I should be stoked. Like ""Dude he's complimenting you"" right? But.. I'm an overweight out of shape south american woman. That shit ain't pretty, sister. **I know I'm more than fuckable** but the way he says it just sounds sooo...sooo.. ugh.. I dunno. Do you understand what I'm saying? Like if you had acne and someone came up to you and said you have an awesome skin...

**(2)** Walking alone at night. I think I had said something about liking to eat and I might have described what I think is a perfect burger. so he stops me, tilts my head up by touching my chin and kisses me passionetely. Again ""Dude...that sounds like AWESOME"" ....well then why am I feeling so...WEIRD? It's just ODD! Right? Am I the only one?


**(3)** He picks me up. The first time I told him: ""Yo! You'll probably get a hernia if you pick me up. And all that extra space between me and the floor if you hold me up here is just confusing to me, I'm constantly panicking that you're going to break your back and that I'll be charged with manslaughter.""  He laughed and very dominantly told me to ""Shut the fuck up"" and refused to put me down and started kissing me. So again you'd think ""Dude! why are you complaining he's awesome"" and maybe if there was a film crewe filming us it would be but there wasn't and I. Did not. Like it. I DUNNO WHY! WHYY????? Why don't I feel comfortable about this?

**(4)** He kisses my forehead. Says stuff like ""You know, I like you. And not just because of the sex. I REALLY like you"" with that smolder look he has most of the time. Something Like [this](http://imgur.com/B0P0O) a bit more serious. He likes to cuddle, He has awesome stamina, he smells good, He trims his pubes, his balls smell nice and clean all the time, his feet don't smell, He even owns a bike with all the attire, he is great with children and loves them too, he doesn't mind period sex, we have nothing yet so much in common, we have the same sense of humour.

I even farted infront of him and he didn't even flinch he looked at me smiled and said ""Good one"". I Laughed my embarrassment away and then he let one rip aswell followed by a ""I win"". Not only is that total badass but I love that he actually tried to make it the least embarrasing for me too. He's just such a gentleman. 

WHY DO I FIND IT SO OFFPUTTING THEN???????????? I told all my friends this and they think I'm overreacting...but it's driving me mad that I can't find ONE thing wrong with him. We've been dating for 6 weeks now and I somehow don't like him! I DUNNNO! I DUNNO WHY!! WHY?? I mean.

When I lost my virginity, I did not tell the girl at the time and we proceeded to have sex a few more times over the next week.  In my mind, it being my first time had a lot to do with how i perceived the experience and what it meant to me.  But the only real outward signs I remember showing were spending a long time (maybe 30-45 min) on foreplay, and that I was rather giddy, bordering on laughter most of the time.  That first night, we spent about 2-3 hours alternating between sex and foreplay before I finished.

She said she didn't think I spent enough money on her. That was the main complaint, along with my house being messy. I would take this girl out every once in a while, never to fancy things though, which may have been my problem.

Christmases/valentines days were similar, although less costly. It seemed the main place I lacked in spending was day to day items.

As I write that sentence, I'm kind of getting a ""what did you expect"" type of feeling, so maybe I should've just known that she'd be a little ""spoiled"" or whatever you wanna call it.

I've always thought that spending should be mostly equal, but since I'm a guy and we live in America, I'd more than happy to spend a little bit more on her than she has to on me. I'm sure I'd be happy to do that anywhere, as I'm not very strict with my money, and I'm not even worried when money spent on my friends gets disproportionate.

So far everything seems to be going alright.

So the other day we were having lunch together, and I asked her to tell me something about herself. She told me about her first relationship, from 13-17, and how her boyfriend abused and beat her pretty badly. Needless to say, I was surprised she decided to share it with me.

Anyway, that was a long time ago (she is almost 27 now), and she's a very strong and independent woman (one of the things I like most about her). Still, I don't know if being a victim of such abuse you can just move on and be done with it.

My question to you gals is: what can I do to be supportive to her? I've never dealt with something like this so I don't know if I should flat out tell her I'll never lay a hand on her or ask her if she needs something from me to feel safe, is this too patronizing? Any behaviors I should be aware of, things I should refrain from doing, anything? Perhaps I should just leave that alone and don't touch the subject?

Obviously, reliable protection is necessary.  I will use a condom, at the minimum until I'm in a stable STD-free relationship, but I'd like to be on birth control as well.  For one, it's an additional layer of insurance against a pregnancy, and additionally, I have quite painful cramps and periods, and some control over them would be much appreciated.

However, my parents are far from enthusiastic or accepting that I might become sexually active, and are not in support of me going on birth control.  I've discussed the period control aspect of it with them and they're really not going for it.  Since they're providing me with significant financial support for college, not to mention that I value our relationship and peace in the family, I'd like to avoid getting birth control with their knowledge.

I know that what I tell my doctor is confidential, and that he could give me a prescription for BC, but filling it would mean going through the insurance company, and as I'm on my parents insurance, they would know.

I really doubt I can afford to pay for it without insurance.  I am a full time student, and while I have a part time job, I make something like $5000 a year, which is pretty instantly spent on essentials.  $50 a month would definitely be pushing my budget.

I'm considering going to a Planned Parenthood clinic.  I know that they scale prices based on your financial situation.  When determining this though, do they look at just my income, or my parents as well?  Are there disadvantages or other things I should know about going to PP?

Adamantly against them.  Some of it stemmed from my mother telling me while I was growing up that I should never have them and that, while she loved me dearly, if she could go back she might not have them again.

It's only been this year really that I've gone from ""I 100% never want kids"" to ""I might want kids in the future. Maybe"".  

It's still something I'm highly unsure of, and I know that were I consider kids, I wouldn't want them till after 30.  Problem is, I know my boyfriend (23) almost definitely wants them; and while we've only been dating a year, I'm completely in love with him, and I'm almost certain he's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. 

I'm not so much against kids, and if we were to get married and something accidentally happened, I wouldn't abort, but at the moment I don't know if I'll ever be in the position of actively wanting to conceive a child.  

Mostly, the idea of kids just scares the hell out of me. I'm worried of my life completely changing, of the expense and destruction and time investment they bring, of not being able to accomplish my career goals, and of  not being able to go out and enjoy myself without responsibility. I'm also terrified of the physical toll pregnancy takes.


On the flip side, I am actually pretty good with young kids. I really do like being around them. I love playing with my friends kids, and I know there's a part of me that would want to pass down my family traditions to another generation--but all of this, more often than not, is overshadowed by this fear. I'm afraid of the ""what if I never want kids?""

My question to you ladies who previously didn't want kids is: what happened? Did something just click? At what age or what point in your life? Did you have the same fears as I did and simply get over them?  If you have them now, do you regret it? 

I'm not looking for relationship advice, my bf knows I'm uncertain about kids in the future, but am also open to the possibility that I might want them. I'm' just looking for some shared stories and experiences.

I've always sucked at updating things that I've submitted, mostly because I've never had a happy ending to a bad situation before.  Fortunately, today I can say that I have had such an ending.

After a little over a week of interaction, a woman I met via okcupid suddenly fell off the grid.  For about three days there was no response to anything I said, and so I ended up just deciding that it sucked, but things happen, and deciding to get on with my day to day.  It was pretty terrible to meet someone that I had so much in common with and have that interaction suddenly cut off, but stuff happens.

Just when it was almost completely out of my mind, I received a message from her on okcupid.  It as just a simple one line message and read ""Where did you go!""

As it turned out, there was a malfunction with the messenger service we were using---kik messenger.  She had ignored an update, and so the app was not notifying her of messages.  I felt like a jackass for assuming that she had completely lost interest, and she was really excited to get back into a conversation with me.  We made plans to get together this week and grab lunch, and all of our previous plans we made before this misunderstanding are sill in place, including her birthday and a concert in October.  Everything is looking awesome!

Well anyway, I'm not sure that anyone will care, but I figured I'd update anyway.  It was a happy ending, so, I'm pretty stoked right now.  To a lot of people, such a small thing as this might not be that big of a deal, but to me, who was left at the alter a year and a half ago, it's absolutely fantastic.  I haven't been able to have a sincere, meaningful relationship with someone since then, and it looks like that's where this is headed.

Skip to the second if you just want to see my dilemma.)

So while we were experimenting sexually the other day, she said she wanted it rough. No problem -- I've been with girls that like rough sex before, and in a lot ways I prefer it (it feels the most passionate). Eventually -- after mild success with ""pounding"" -- I grab her hair at the base of her head and pull, *hard.* I've got her pinned up against the wall, strongly pulling her head back by her hair, and start sucking on her neck right in a sweet spot. She had the most intensely aroused reaction I've ever witnessed from sex.

So naturally, I wanted to talk about it afterwards, but she was suddenly very shy. She's normally confident and outgoing, having a reputation among our group of friends as being ""crazy,"" but now she wouldn't even look me in the eye. I've never seen her like that. Anyway, I didn't want to push whatever was making her feel this way, so I tried to change the subject as casually as possible.

Then, while we were laying in bed that night, she quietly -- again, like she was embarrassed -- told me that earlier the closest she's ever gotten to living out her biggest fantasy. A little more (gentle) prying, and she tells me that the thought of losing control turns her on. Eventually (finally) she tells me that she ""wants to feel raped,"" and that she wants me to try it with her (her exact words). I want to emphasize that I'm not reading between the lines here, she explicitly told me she wanted me to try raping her.

I don't have a problem doing kinky things, and if this is that sexy to her, I really want to do it. Like I said before though, I've had rough sex before, and I like being pretty dominant, but I don't have much experience with anything like this. Can anyone give me advice of any kind? Is this a common thing? I'm pretty lost at the moment.

I can replay certain scenarios for days making little changes to it until I capture perfect erotica.  It's basically like writing a 15 year long erotic novel with romantic elements, but entirely in my imagination.

I also feel affectionate towards the characters after all of this time.  They're so familiar to me that now they're comforting as well as erotic.  I have revisited their lives over and over and over again for one and a half decades.

LDR SO and I have been dating for 8 months.

I found out the other day she cheated on me as a one time instance. She has expressed guilt, anger, remorse, and disgust for herself. Her knowledge that she effectively ruined me makes it all the worse for her.

Apologies aren't enough, but because she has taken steps to completely remove these people from her life (and she has), and her vow to change her ways, I have decided that perhaps this is worth salvaging. She has expressed multiple times that nothing is worth losing me over, and she is willing to do whatever it takes to keep me in her life.

Me wanting to move forward with this, however, does not change the fact that right now I have little trust for her. I am very angry. I'm trying to find it in myself to forgive her so I can move past the anger and contempt, but it's difficult right now.
It's worth mentioning that we're in a LDR, because she has a lot of internet guy friends, and she effectively emotionally cheated on me with one of said internet guy friends.

Despite the fact that she has cut contact with the offenders, I'm worried that this will happen again. Rightfully so, because she still has a lot of single guy friends that she spends time with on the internet.
What concerns me the most is that she vehemently refuses to disclose our relationship to her internet guy friends. She says that she's not ashamed, but she feels like they wont want to hang out with us (because we all play games together) if her friends felt like they were the 3rd wheel. She feels like whether we're in a relationship or not is not anyone's business.

Even before she cheated on me I knew she felt that way, but I feel like if our relationship is not disclosed, it will potentially setup an environment that allows guys to unnecessarily develop feelings for her. I also feel like by not disclosing that there's something to hide. I mean, after all, the person she cheated on me with didn't know about us either.

Are my thoughts rational, or does this insecurity stem because of this bad past experience? I'm quite frankly uncomfortable, very much so, with her just simply refusing to disclose what we're doing. Of course I don't expect anyone to simply, out of the blue, be like, ""YEAH, I'M DATING CHEATEDTHROWS"". No. But you can certainly work it in a conversation. She won't do that either.

**TL;DR: LDR Girlfriend cheated on me with a guy that had no idea we were dating. Despite the fact she removed them from her life, going forward with her single guy internet friends, she still refuses to disclose our relationship, citing the reasons as it's nobody's business and she feels like if they know about us, they will feel uncomfortable around us because we all play games together. Do I have a right to be concerned, given the situation? Because quite frankly, her refusal to make it known we're dating bothers the everliving fuck out of me**

So, I'm really struggling with meeting new people after college. I tried googleing / searching on reddit for answers, but didn't find any advice that I wasn't already trying. I was hoping you would be able to provide me with some insight for getting out there and making new friends / building new relationships with women my age (mid 20s). 

Just a bit of background info: Like many people who have recently finished college, I had to move halfway across the country to start my career, and I left my life and friends behind. (We still keep in touch, and I go back to visit about once a season.) Unfortunately, I ended up in area where the population consists mainly of 40-50 year old parents with kids in middle / high school. I would hope there are people my age somewhere in the surrounding area because there seems to be a decent population. However, everyone is very spread out, and I just don't know how to meet them. So, basically, I'm having trouble meeting people because:

* There aren't any 20s oriented bars / night clubs within a 45 minute drive
* The restaurants close down at 9 PM on the weekends
* Everyone at my company is male and over 40 (there are 2 people younger than 30 and I'm one of them...)

Things I have tried doing to meet people:

* I joined a gym and go 2-3 times a week, but they don't seem to have any coed sports leagues 
* I go out for jogs around my neighborhood hoping to meet people my age who live nearby
* I checked meetup.com all summer but there is nothing other than new mom groups and singles over 45 clubs within a 45 minute drive
* I tried OKCupid.com but it's basically a barren wasteland for my area

* I checked the local newspaper for groups / clubs, most were for people over 50 and single parents. I did try out a hiking / canoeing group a few times but again it was just older folks.

So, where do you normally go to hang out and have a good time? What are some of your favorite places for meeting new people? Where do you look for clubs/sports to join? (I would love to join a frisbee coed league...)

I really want her to be comfortable talking about those types of things with me, (even though I'll be very uncomfortable hearing it, lol) because unfortunately, there is no mother figure in the house to help her cope with these things. I figure she may be uncomfortable talking things out with her dad, but I have no other options. I have no girlfriend to talk to her, I've been to busy with work and Emily, my daughter, to find time to get a girlfriend. I have no idea what to do, I know I need to act now and gain her trust or we may never have the type of relationship I want to have. So tell me, how can I get my daughter to talk to me?

One is questions related to women: There are three.

General questions (like the TP scrunchers/folders, prenup questions, though they could be put into other categories if you wanted): There are three.

Where it's guy related and women related about being abandoned by their fathers, didn't know where to put that one. So that's in both.

Directly sex related (blowjob enjoyment, micro-penis, etc): There are five

And lastly anything to do with guys (dating preferences, being approached by dangerous looking guys, etc): There are thirteen. 

I don't know if it's overwhelmingly true since the subs creation, but it is clearly the biggest category.

How do you feel about most questions being directly related to males?

This weekend we went on a trip together with some of my friends, and it was just a very couple-ly experience, and I realized I had much more fun with her than without her, and although we're not in a relationship it felt very much like we were. So when we got back from the trip I asked her if she wanted to be mutually exclusive. She said no, and that she wasn't ready because it was more fun right now to go out partying and get hit on (I'm several years older so I'm very much over the party scene).

Fire away!

This subject brought to you by a conversation I had with one of my best friends recently. We'll call him Jacob.

I met Jacob through D&amp;D. My first perception of him was that he was a typical gaming geek. He's shorter than I am, significantly overweight, in his early twenties, and extremely shy around strangers and new acquaintances. We met each other a little over a year ago and now he's part of my inner circle of friends.

Jacob has no martial arts training. He's not a gym rat, he doesn't bike thirty miles to work, he's not a private military contractor, he doesn't have secret ninja abilities. What he does have is deep and unshakable **moral courage**. We've been in a few sketchy situations together, and instead of shrinking back he stood shoulder to shoulder with us, even when the consequences would seem more dire for him than the rest of our little group. He stands by his beliefs with the kind of equanimity that most people wish they could have, accepting the opinions of others while staying true to his own.

He's the biggest badass I know, because he stands up for what he believes in even when, by most standards of social perception, he shouldn't have the courage of confidence to do so. He always, always does the right thing, regardless of the cost to himself. So, what makes a man a badass to you?

[edit 2] Based on responses, it seems like most of the difference is based on how much more dry women become with condoms. That would also cause the unpleasant latex-y feeling, which isn't so noticeable with lots of lubrication.

As mentioned in a [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10wh66/faq_you_buddy/) about the FAQs, we will be posting a question every few days and asking you guys to give us your answer for it. The best answers will be used in the actual FAQ.

Some related questions include ""Who pays for dates?"" or ""Who pays for the first date?"", ""Would you rather date a rich guy or a poor guy?"", ""Is my job a deal breaker?"", etc.

One: a girl who is fun, funny, lighthearted, dresses well and is reasonably attractive (she has recently gained weight due to student living and significant recent stress but there have still been people interested in her) who sabotages her potential relationships by never really ... I suppose the best way to put it would be never making the effort or extending herself. The last few guys she was interested in actually seemed pretty interested in her, and we know for a fact that one was, but she never told him how she felt and he asked out another girl. When she has been in a relationship or in a situation where one might happen she often tends to pull away and/or not really bother to hang out with the guy, because deep down she's always rather ambivalent about whether or not she wants a relationship - or whether she wants anything, really, as this applies to her study/work life as well. So even though she complains about being single it often seems like that's more about feeling unwanted than anything else.

Friend two is a massive girly girl, decently attractive but... well, she isn't a feminist at all (I just feel I should say that for the sake of the sisterhood with what I'm about to say next) and she is a complete misandrist. She's that stereotype who tells everyone that boys are stupid and mean. She once had a guy in one of her classes who invited her to hang out multiple times and at no point did she ever make a reciprocal move (eg asking him to hang next time, or telling him she was interested) because ""that's the guy's job"". On a recent first date she gave a guy a link to her online poetry and you can imagine what sort of bitterness was in those poems. She's also just irritating as hell in daily conversation. She really is very pretty but looks just aren't enough in this situation.

Friend three is a gay guy, complete sweetheart, very clever and with a sharp sense of humour and an unusual but not ugly face. His trouble - an incandescently obvious desperation for a relationship combined with a significantly more obvious low self esteem that permeates all his conversations and friendships. He has the kind of social anxiety that scares everyone away because they fear being his only lifeline in a time of trouble. I have recently found out that a friend of mine wants to ask him out, and that makes me happy because I wonder if maybe experiencing that level of interest and flirtation will be enough for this guy to see that he isn't unlovable and thus stop broadcasting to everyone that he is unlovable.",,False,,t5_2rxrw,False,,female,True,t3_14ypz5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14ypz5/do_you_have_a_friend_who_is_forever_alone_why_do/,

Teen years - likes non-threatening boy-band or artist types.

Late teens/Early twenties - develops taste for bad-boys/adventurers.

Late twenties/Early Thirties - Wants more 'successful' types.

Late thirties/Early Forties - Values emotional stability/maturity, good company, as well as a dash of the previous two decades' types.  Never goes back to the Biebers.

My friend Rachel was complaining because she had to take her daughter to one of those Godawful child-fun factories, a Chuckie Cheese type of place, but with bounce castles.  Her daughters father was very adament about not wanting to go, and not wanting to leave her stuck in that small world of hell and toddlers, I opted to share the burden with her and I said I'd go with them.  When I meet up with them at their house she told me her 15 year old cousin Sara would be coming with us.  Sara's mother died a couple of years ago leaving her an orphan.  She had been home schooled her whole life, and while she could speak more eloquently than anyone I've ever met her age, she was woefully under prepared for the real world in many other areas, including socially.  

I had watched from a distance this girl go through these terrible tragedies, as well as grow up.  Rachel's parents/family are very much my second family.  I've spent more nights there than any other place I didn't call ""home"". Part of the reason this is, is because parents are the most empathetic people I have ever met.  They have literally adopted, raised, and married off friends of mine.  When someone abandoned two baby pit bulls (runts) in my backyard a few years ago I tried caring for them while I found them an owner.  They offered to watch them for a night to give me a break. I never got them back.  It's the most adorable thing, this older Jewish couple, artistic and educated with these two nasty, slobbery *giant* abandoned fighting dogs. When I met Sara she was a sad 10 year old orphan who had never interacted with the outside world and they've done a great job raising her but she clearly was ready to assert her personality.

And God damn what a personality.  She came out in matching turquoise skirt, sweater and *lipstick*.  She was still that weird awkward home schooled kid, but she was definitely growing into her own now that she was attending high school.  On the car ride up I mainly just listened and played with Rachel's daughter in the back, when the conversation turned to if there were any other orphans in her school she mentioned a classmate and friend named Katie who was also the only *other* lesbian in school.  

Once we got to the Godforsaken torture chamber of childrens screams we huddled together to fend off interaction with the unwashed masses.  Sure we were pleasant and polite with the few much older parents we were obligated to interact with due to the nature of the birthday party, but really we mostly kept to ourselves and played cards.  Rachel had to keep an eye on her daughter which left Sara and I alone a lot.  I tried to keep the conversation to pretty casual topics like what classes she likes, adjusting to living with her aunt, and about her friends, but she kept bringing up the topic of sexuality.  Eventually I started asking her questions because she clearly wanted to talk about it.  She said most of her friends were the other gay students, except for one ""kinda weird religious kid Charles who says lesbians are ok but gay guys are weird.  His church is supposed to be all about acceptance but conversion"".  She also mentioned that Rachel was the first family she came out to, and that was just the prior day.  She's not concerned at all about her family accepting it given their liberal background, and I think a part of her does wonder if this is just a ""phase"".  That wasn't all we talked about, and oh God... teenage boys are such idiots and jerks.  I told her a story about how when I was in high school I openly mocked a girl for her cutting scars, and how embarrassed I am about that now.  I just tried to remember how when I was in my teens there was a friends older brother who always gave me great advice, spoke to me like an adult, and just really listened, and I tried to replicate that as best as I could.

I'm a 19 year old female and I have this problem--the female version of death grip masturbation. I started masturbating at a rather young age--7 or 8--and have done it in a certain way ever since. I cross my legs and sort of squeeze my thighs together until I orgasm--usually doesn't take me more than 5 minutes. 

This does lead to wonderful orgasms so I'm not complaining, but I am now in my first serious relationship and this has sort of become an issue for me when it comes to sex. I haven't orgasmed any other way before and as good as the sex is, I can't cum from it, or from manual stimulation. And yes, I know a lot of women can't orgasm from sex alone so we do incorporate clit play but I need so much pressure that it becomes impossible and tiring for both of us.

My SO is away this entire month so I want to try and solve this problem. I know I'm going to have to stop masturbating the way I do. I've tried before but it's really hard not to get impatient/frustrated so I just end up giving up and going back to my old ways. 

What I'm asking is have any other ladies out there experienced this issue? If so, how did you get past it?

She has always had male friends and that has never been an issue. I meet these guys, we hang out, we drink, I get to know them. Recently she has a new friend at work and I have misgivings about him.

 The friend is going through relationship issues and he and my wife talk at work and after hours via text and chat. A while back and a few times he has told her that he thought he had a chance with her until he found out she was married. He has mentioned that he was turned on by her once and had to leave the room. He has told her that she is attractive and funny and geeky and that is rare in a woman. 

 I have never met this guy. He is socially awkward and doesn't want to meet or hangout with people. I finally told my wife that I feel that's odd and I would like to meet him. She has tried to get him to hangout but he still doesn't want to do it.
So we had an argument about it.
She gives me two options to resolve this.
1, she stops talking to him
2, she stops talking to me about him.
I feel that either of those makes me to be a horrible person.
Either I'm the guy who doesn't let his wife have friends or my wife has some unknown attachment to a man I don't know.

It feels odd to me and I have never been a jealous type.
She says I have lots of female friends and this is true. But I try to include her in every aspect of my friendship with these people. I game with these people and they live in other states. And she can and has been invited to game and chat with all of us anytime.

Like I said, I trust my wife, she has always had and still has other male friends, but this one just makes me feel odd.  
So now we are on pins and needles and she thinks I don't trust her.
If I had a female friend I would want her to know my wife. If I were friends with a woman who had a SO I would want him to meet me so that they know everything is on the up and up as well. 

So, how bad did I fuck this one up? And how do I fix it?

*Edit* So we talked some more and I let her know my big red flag. She spoke with GUY1 and let him know that her HUSBAND would like to meet him yet again and that it is causing issues with us. I thanked her for letting him know this even though it is ultimately his choice, and I thanked her for taking my feelings into consideration. He agreed and so we will hang out like we do on most Fridays and have some beers with other Coworkers.

I've been trying and trying for years, as long as I can remember, to get a girlfriend. As I kept failing it became just trying to get a date; just one date. Finally it has devolved into just looking for sex. No luck in any of them.

I don't understand how the human race has survived if it's this difficult. I feel completely rejected and cut off by the female population. Every girl I've ever asked out basically laughs ""Oh, you thought I liked you?"" It can't be this hard for everyone or we would have gone extinct long ago.

So that creates an elephant in the room for me: Why is it so hard for me?! What is wrong with my brain that it doesn't know how to fulfill the primary natural instinct of every other creature on the planet? What is it about my behavior and personality that screams ""BAD GENETIC MATERIAL; NOT WORTH YOUR TIME""?

I've heard so much about the not seeking validation in romance/sex thing. Do those people realize what it's like to have never been told ""I love you"" except by a family member? To have never had any member of the opposite sex express any interest in you? To not know if any girl has ever looked at you and wanted you? Were you ever picked last for kickball at recess?

Give a hug (maybe), ask how she's doing, etc, etc. She does the same, and then says something along the lines of, ""You look so pretty!"" You say thank you. And then what? 

I don't want to follow it up with, ""Oh, you too!"" because that seems forced. It's not that I don't mean it, more that it won't seem genuine. Honestly, I just *never* think to comment on a woman's appearance. Is that weird?

I'm a single father...",AwesomeSingleDad,97,16,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/sxr7z/women_of_reddit_i_need_your_advice_and_on_a_few/,"I have a few big questions, and I need the help of awesome women everywhere. First a little background. I'm a single father. My daughter's mom and I didn't work out, and we separated when my girl was about 18 months old. Through twists of fate I landed majority custody, and I rocked it. I do everything for my daughter, and she is happy and prosperous (and don't worry, I keep her in check). The divorce courts agreed I kicked ass and I ended up with court ordered majority custody; my ex gets every other weekend, some holiday time etc, but I'm the primary guy. My daughter nearly 3 now. 

So first question. How the fuck do I do her hair? Currently I wash it every couple of nights, I brush it in the morning before school and put it in a pony tail, wrapping a single hair band around about seven times. Her hair isn't very long yet, just below the shoulder, but it's growing. Sometimes I put a clip in her bangs too but it often looks out of place. At the end of the day, her hair is a mess. I want to know what I am doing wrong, what other things I can do, and so on. Her hair is wavy/curly and pretty thick.

Next, how can I make sure she grows up respecting herself, and not let shitty boys take advantage of her? My current plan is just to set such an awesome role model as a strong good male that she will realize shitty dudes for what they are. Any first hand experience would be appreciated though. 

And finally, how the hell do I go about meeting a nice woman for myself? I'm in my early 30s, I am fit and healthy, I dress excellently, I have a great education and an awesome (if rather nerdy) job, I'm tall, I'm confident and I have decent amounts of cash. I am well mannered and will treat everyone very well. I've also been told by friends that I'm handsome, but that's clearly a subjective thing and I'm not one to boast. I live in Los Angeles, which has about the worst singles male:female ratio in the country.

I want a strong independent woman. I can't have a woman who is going to blow up and go crazy (like my last girlfriend, who I had to break up with because she was adding so much stress to my life). I want her to earn as much if not more money than me. I don't care if she has or wants kids; obviously she has to be understanding and loving towards my daughter, but I am not biased one way or the other for wanting more kids or not. I want her to be attractive (yes, I am shallow), and to love sex and touching and loving. 

Where the hell do I find women like this? They won't be propping up the bar in the local dive, they won't be using online dating services. Perhaps I am just too picky, but I know women like this exist. I frequently have people tell me that I will find an amazing woman, but it's not happened in the last 18 months and I'm beginning to doubt it will.

I apologize for the length of this post, and I'm sure my dating question is asked a lot, but I figured I may as well go ahead and ask. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

I've had a few conversations about it.  (Light Mad Men S5E3 spoilers)  There was a recent scene in *Mad Men* between Peggy and Abe that was discussing where they wanted to spend their future together and well.  It really got me thinking about what was important and how much I did care about this stuff.   Even if it was just a 5 minute scene on TeeVee, it was nice to hear another similar opinion being express.  Abe, you just get me sometimes.

I love living in the city.  And not like... *the city*, but just deep in the heart of any community.  I need to be connected to it, I can't passively take part.  As Abe said, ""I always thought we'd raise our kids around people who are different"".  It's not how I was raised, and frankly any other way sounds unappealing.

The home doesn't so much matter.  Location is most important.  The reason the home isn't important is I want to build it and make it *my home*.  If I have to build a firepit and grill in the backyard I will.  If I need to add a screen porch I will, but I'd prefer one be there anyways.  I'd like multiple bathrooms.  I'd like wood floors everywhere and a fireplace.  I'd like an older, more rustic look to the house.  But the point is I want to *build it myself*.

Like I said, I don't care too much about what the house *has*, but I want to fill it with books.  Books from my childhood, books from my adolescence.  A wall for comics, a wall for movies, maybe another for records.  Books though, everywhere.  Piles of them.  Plants too.  I need there to be *life*, smells all that shit in my home.  It's all I've ever known.  I don't mind clutter, or knick knacks and shit like old clocks and flags on the wall (I plan to have my home state flag hanging).  I currently have a map of my city on the wall, each small neighborhood and community divided and labeled. Comforting pillows and lots of places to curl up and isolate yourself. Pictures of loved one, pictures of people I don't know.  A framed poem that was written for me. Old clocks and kitchy shit. The kitchen is important.  I'll spend a lot of time in there, either socializing or isolating.  Lots of heavy cast iron, shit hanging on the walls.  I don't want cabinet doors, I'm notorious for leaving them open.  Shelves seem nicer anyways.  I *want to build my own kitchen*.  Fuck an island too, I want a nook with lots of light.  More glass and plants.  Light everywhere.

Most of the relationships I have been in have began because the woman has expressed an interest in me (to me or a friend), I find myself spending much more time with that person and almost always develop feelings for that person and begin a relationship. This leads to the hurt of ending a relationship that I think could have been spotted and avoided early. I am more than willing to suffer pain at the end of a relationship full of love and a good time even if I know it won't lead to anything lasting. Also, I tend to disregard minor things for the love I've developed and sacrifice my happiness or my independence for the person I am in a relationship with. Ultimately, this leads to a couple problems - I have no clue what kind of girl I am looking for (since pretty much all of them seem ""fine enough"") and don't really actively seek a partner as a result. I end up just 'accepting' the feelings she has for me and developing them myself only after spending more time on our own and romantically. I also find myself most comfortable with women that are already in a relationship with a friend of mine because there is none of the pressure of this conundrum and it has cost me a couple friendships because either the man thinks I am flirting with his girlfriend or the girlfriend starts to develop feelings for me that aren't really reciprocated (so far the former has happened twice and the latter four times). 

I need your advice or your take on this, how can I change the mindset I have to the women in my life and gain a better identity of someone who I am compatible with. Also, should I tone down the way I act around girls that are dating friends of mine? I want to make them feel welcome and comfortable around his friends but hate the problems I have when I act this way. Are my standards too low? What is the problem?

TL;DR I haven't really liked anyone on my own since high school and only develop feelings after they express some interest in me and we spend more time together. Also I have no clue what kind of woman I am looking for because they all seem pretty unique and sufficient for my love.

So, for example, a typical relationship will progress physically like this: kiss on maybe the second date, makeouts a date or two after depending on the context. I might do some feeling up, but will probably wait until the next time (again, depending on the context). Next time I might finger her (which all girlfriends except for one have said I am very good at, and I usually will try to get her off more than once in this way over the course of the evening when I first do this).

The idea I guess is to get to know her body so I can please her better, and to be generous by giving her several orgasms before I get one back :P Even on the night of the first sex I will typically try to give her one before we get to the deed.

We were usually too broke to go out on dates, so we would get a couple bottles of cheap wine, put on some music, and cook ourselves a gourmet meal.

Since then, I've expanded my cooking repertoire and have come to enjoy it as a creative, relaxing activity with a great outcome.  I like to throw on some music, pour a glass of wine, and take up the whole kitchen.  A lot of the dishes I make are inspired by pictures on the internet, but I rarely go by recipes so there have been some **epic** fails.  I have a few vegan/ vegetarian friends and family members, so although I eat meat I like the challenge of putting together a delicious and nutritious multiple course vegan meal.  It's really become one of my favorite activities.  Here are a few of my recent favorites:

**1.** [Bison steak with roasted acorn squash and brussel sprout and bacon salad](http://i.imgur.com/B72aj64.jpg)

**2.** [Vegan chipotle chimichanga over iceberg lettuce and tomato salad](http://i.imgur.com/pwOu8YA.jpg)

**3.** [Pho soup with skirt steak, plum tofu, roasted mushrooms, green onions and bean sprouts, and a nice glass of Bohemian Highway cab](http://i.imgur.com/f1FBLCD.jpg)

**5.** [Completely gratuitous cat pic](http://i.imgur.com/KWyD6Gd.jpg)

All photos snagged off my instagram, of course.

What do you ladies like to cook when you show off?  What are some of your favorite recipes?  Do you cook-by-the-book, or is it more intuitive for you?  Or do you prefer baking?  What's your cooking ritual?  And what's your favorite glass of wine to have by the stove?

And if anyone wants a recipe for any of the above, just ask!

**EDIT** Adding some recipes per request!

**1.** Acorn squash is one of my favorite things to make because it's so tasty and so easy, all I do is cut it in half, scoop out the stringy innards, drizzle or spray some olive oil on it, add salt and lotsa black pepper, then throw it in the oven at 350 until the skin starts to crinkle a little and the top browns a bit.  (Eat the skin, it's got loads of vitamins and the texture isn't as weird as you think)
For the brussel sprouts, I take a couple pieces of bacon and dice it up, then cook it till crunchy in a big sautee pan, add the shaved brussel sprouts (time consuming, but worth it for the recipe) to all the rendered fat and cook it down.  Once cooked down a bit, add some Grey Poupon mustard and pepper, and a teeny bit of balsamic for sweetness.  (This method works wonders with kale or collard greens as well!)

**2.** Make some refried beans first.  I usually use black beans, so I throw a bit of olive oil into a pan, then simmer/ fry the black beans until they're soft and mashable, add salt, pepper, chipotle powder, chopped onion and jalapeno, and cumin, let the flavors come together for a while.  dump it into a big, soft tortilla wrap and add some avocado, fresh red onion, sriracha, and cilantro, then wrap is up tight.  get a pan nice and hot with a little layer of oil in there, and put the burrito in seam-side down so that it closes itself.  fry it up until desires crunchiness, then throw it on top of some diced iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, top with vegan sour cream and chipotle salsa (store-bought).

**3.** This was a blizzard meal my friends and I made last winter, and it was perfect for weathering the storm.  we used low-sodium vegetable broth, then boiled it and added powdered ginger, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, and an onion.  The tofu and skirt steak we marinated in plum sauce and baked at 350 until we were happy with it (skirt steak was a little over-done, so I have no time to give.)  The mushrooms we marinated in soy sauce and baked for about 10 minutes, and we cooke some black rice noodles from the japanese section of our grocery store.  then we just cut everything into chopstick-manageable sizes, threw them in serving bowls for people to take what they wanted, and had a giant ladle for the broth.  delicious!

**4.**  (this is the easiest thing to make ever)  sautee the kale and red onion in a pan on high while you pop the meatless meatballs (I use Trader Joe's brand) into the toaster (it gives them a nice crunch and helps them to hold their shape).  rinse the yam noodles ( (check them out,)[http://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/category/shirataki-noodles] they're carb-free, ridiculously low-cal, and delicious!  but have a fishy smell right out of the packaging).  open a small can of sodium-free tomato sauce (I use store-brand), throw it in a bowl, then microwave it for a minute.  add the noodles and some oregano, chopped garlic, basil, whatever you want, and microwave till it's unbearably hot to touch.  throw in the kale and onions, mix, then drop the meatballs on top and let it sit for a minute for the flavors to come together.  yum!

&gt;When you approach me in public, you are Schrödinger’s Rapist. You may or may not be a man who would commit rape. I won’t know for sure unless you start sexually assaulting me.

It is pretty unsightly, and I am lucky enough to have it on my penis, among other places but they are of much less concern. I've had it all of my adult life and it has put a pretty significant reduction in my confidence to pursue dating and relationships (I know it probably shouldn't but believe me its hard to forget about), as a result I have never been with a girl. In case you were wondering there are treatments for it but the side effects can be a bit scary (some will weaken immune system), and on a place where skin is this sensitive I try to minimize the topical medications (also side effects), so I haven't been able to eliminate it completely.

My question is, and please be brutally honest, how much would this effect your wanting to be with a guy? I could participate in sex if wearing a condom, but is this reduction/limitation of physical contact a big deal? How much do you value this skin to skin contact specifically? (I know a lot of guys are big fans of not having to wear condoms) How important is the appearance of your male partners genitals? At times I feel I over think this thing but to put a certain way, it appears I have an STD despite having never been sexually active, so like I said I have trouble engaging in dating or anything further with that in the back of my head all day.

I don’t frequent this subreddit, but I figure it’s the best place to ask.

My girlfriend and I have a lot of discussions on society’s pressure to conform to a certain body standard. I personally embrace them because it makes my life (i.e. shopping, social, etc.) easier. I find that this issue is more apparent when it comes to shopping for clothes. Society has placed a very rigid standard for female body and it is quite obvious in major retail chains that their sizes and shapes are for supermodel-like bodies. I find it even worse that some stores will pin the extra cloth in the back so that the mannequin has an extra ‘tight’ look.

How do you feel about that? What kind of pressure does it put on you to “conform”? Are there any particular offenders? Are there some stores that you just feel more comfortable in?

Sorry, lots of questions from an uninformed mind.

EDIT: Upvotes for all!!!

EDIT 2: Thank you for all the comments! I tried to respond to each one constructively. Here are the general answers:
* Women come in different shapes and sizes (durrrr!)

* Women's sizes are inconsistent due to ""vanity sizing"" or just stupid systems

* A lot of women feel ashamed of their bodies or are not satisfied with their weight/shape (at least in the changerooms.

* Changeroom attendants can/should do a better job making sure women feel welcome

* The mirrors and lighting in the changerooms are unflattering most of the time

* Women of all shapes and sizes find it challenging to find clothes that fit well, which is discouraging to many

* Having others around may not make it easier to go shopping

Hey ladies.

So, I went to a club last week and my beer was drugged with what I think what a mix of MDMA and GHB (or something like this, I was released from the hospital when I was still very confused and don’t remember what the nurses told me).

I was dancing, everything was fine, and then I started feeling dizzy and hallucinating. I saw shapes and colors dancing around me, faster and faster, and then this feeling of panic and falling and then nothing. Nothing until I woke up around 5 at the hospital.

One of my friends was with me at the club. I later learned that he waited all night at the hospital but they would not tell me (they thought he might have been the one responsible for what happened). 

I spent all weekend not being able to eat (I bit my tongue pretty hard) and feeling disoriented and paranoid. I have a few flashbacks (the shapes and colors, the voice of a female nurse saying my name over and over, waking up at the hospital, waiting for a cab… each flashback only a couple of seconds each) and now my brain is trying to fill the blanks with false memories. And it’s really panicking. 

I don’t really know how to deal with that and I thought maybe some of you might have some advice.

I was pretty lucky. I fell on the dance floor and hurt myself a little bit, but the bouncers there (I was later told) took care of me until the ambulance showed up, so I wasn’t attacked or anything. But it was still a pretty awful experience.

Thanks.

*Edit: I want to thank everybody who shared their experience, as painful as the memories are. You helped me a lot and I'm sure many people were able to see how common this crime can be.

I know some women have problems putting on weight and others issues with losing weight.  I am not judging, genetics play a huge role on what you look like.  You can change your body type, but that isn't my question.  Here is what I am getting at:

- Skinny women: Do you feel you have to eat more in public to show you're not anorexic or anything of that nature. 

- Not as skinny women: Do you feel you have to eat less in public so people don't think of you as being unhealthy.

I mean no offense by this at all.  I am just curious if you feel pressure when you have to eat in public (family dinners, business outings, date night, etc.)

I went out to listen to some country music and there was a girl there that was with a guy. She gave me a look or two but I thought maybe it was weird to her that a black guy was in a country music bar.

The guy she was with was clearly drunnnnnnnk and she looked annoyed. I saw them kiss a few times and  It seemed that he had bought them drinks but his extreme drunkenness turned her off. After a bit the guy stumbles away and then another guy, who was clearly older approaches the girl. She looks even more annoyed and turns to me and whispers... ""save me, please"". 

I let her fall into my arms and lay her head on my chest. The older guy looks at me and then just walks off.  The other guy from before comes over but she just ignores him and then he leaves. The girl and I start talking and then talking turns to dancing and dancing turns to her asking me for a kiss. Having seen her kiss that other dude earlier in the night, I silently decline but we keep dancing. She then starts talking about how hot I am and this goes on the whole night. Eventually I give in and we wind up making out on and off the whole night. 

We catch a cab to her place and make out more. She throws me on the bed and gets on top of me but then stops herself saying if this goes further she won't wake up in time for work. I agree because honestly I had to be at work too.  I ask for some water and we go in the kitchen and talk more. 

After we finish the water, we start making out again on her kitchen counter and we basically get started on second base but then we both stop and just agree to hang out the next day.  Then I notice her picture of Africa on the wall and we talk about a mutual love of travel. I'm thinking awesome, I'd love to get to know her better because there's substance here beyond the physical....

But when I contact her, no response.  At all. 

**Considering this type of thing happened to me the week prior and a month before that, I'm starting to wonder if there's something wrong with me.** I meet a girl, we hit it off, we exchange numbers, most of the time I don't ask for the number because I know girls give them out to be nice or not hurt the guys ego when asked....and yet despite the number exchange being their idea they still  don't answer when I contact them. 

**What's the deal? What can I do different?** I try to have genuine conversations, be fun and show interest and lately they just seem to be done with me after that night. 

I guess what further confuses me is the extra effort, making a point to give me the full first and last name and acknowledge it so I know when I get a phone number. Or rushing to provide a number when it wasn't requested....like why do that if you plan on not answering when I call?
