1367816342.0,601,self.Neverwinter,1dry0g,Neverwinter's F2P Model: What you need to know.,Tadders,699,98,467,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dry0g/neverwinters_f2p_model_what_you_need_to_know/,"Just like in any other F2P MMORPG, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding Neverwinter's Zen shop. I will try to shed some light on the current state of Neverwinter's F2P model by assuming a neutral stance. I hope this helps when you formulate some of your own opinions about this game.

**1. Introduction**

There are three immediate currency types in Neverwinter: Gold, Astral Diamonds, and Zen. Gold is obatained through normal means and buys the general necessities to play this game such as potions, basic profession items, basic mounts, and basic companions. Astral Diamonds are obtained through special tasks such as special daily quests, skirmish events, invoking your deity, and the Leadership profession. It buys a wide variety items ranging from Identify Scrolls to rare companions to mid-level gear. It is also the only currency usable in the Auction House. Zen is obtained through paying money. It buys many luxuries that helps give paying players a better experience overall. It may also be traded for Astral Diamonds and vice versa. For simplicity's sake, I will list the price of items in terms of USD instead of Zen.

**2. Mounts**

As a non-paying player of Neverwinter, you get three tokens at level 20 for a standard 50% speed horse that lasts for 5 hours. These horses can also be bought for 5 gold which is entirely manageable. To get a faster mount, you can buy Mount Training which upgrades any horse you own to 80% for 768,000 Astral Diamonds and 110% for 2,064,000 Astral Diamonds. This is progressive so you must buy them in order.

If you decide to drop some Zen for some fancier mounts, a standard 50% mount goes for 5-8 dollars, a rare 80% mount goes for 20-30 dollars, and an epic 110% mount goes for 30-40 dollars. The more expensive mounts of their respective tier has a unique model, such as the Worg and the Howler.

**3. Inventory Space**

You get a free bag at approximately level 10 and 30. They are 18 and 12 slots respectively. There are no craftable bags. For a free player, that means spending Astral Diamonds to buy extra inventory space. A 12 slot bag costs 6 dollars and a 24 slot bag costs 10 dollars.

A player starts out with 16 bank space. An extra 16 slots of bank space can be bought for 6 dollars.

**4. Companions**

Starting at level 16, a player is rewarded a free basic companion. These companions have two skills and have a rank cap of 15. An additional companion costs 2 gold each and may be switched anytime out of combat. All companions are disabled in PvP.

Zen buys a couple of companions which have a completely unique aesthetic. 15 dollars nets you an animal of your choice which have a rank cap of 15. 20 dollars hires a friend which has a rank cap of 20. 30-35 dollars gets you an epic quality pet that has a rank cap of 30 and three unique skills.

**5. Professions**

In Neverwinter, you gain Assets (workers) to do the work for you. Every profession starts you off with the most basic type of worker. You can have them do various amount of tasks on top of hiring more workers. Eventually you can combine 4 workers into an upgraded worker which allows you to tackle harder tasks. On top of these worker Assets, there are also tools Assets. These can be bought for 50s-1g each and have an 8% quality boost. Crafted items have a total of 4 slots for tools and 3 tiers for bonuses that is reached at 100% each.

In the Zen Shop, two different Profession packs exist: Professions Booster Pack and Professions Assets Pack. In the Booster Pack, there is 1 random (both quality and type) worker and random assortments of crafting items. In the Asset pack, there are 1 Purple or Blue Asset, 2 Purple Blue or Green Asset, 1 blue or green Asset and 1 green Asset (for a total of 5 guaranteed Assets). Any player may make any item, but [paying customers will get an upwards of 20% stat increase on their crafted equipment.](http://i.imgur.com/2w42F1j.png)

**6. Character**

You can make up to 2 characters. Two additional character slots may be purchased for 5 dollars. You may also rename your character for 4 dollars.

Respeccing your skills costs 6 dollars. Respeccing your Feats costs Astral Diamonds determined by your current level.

**7. Runes**

If nothing else, please read this part. This is potentially their biggest cash grab scheme and everyone should know how it works.

Players are given the option to add additional stats/effects to their equipment in Neverwinter. These come in the forms of Runestones (pets) and Enchantments (Armor/Weapon). For pets, the Runestones are split into Offense and Defense. For Enchantments, they are split into Offense, Utility, and Defense. A single Runestone/Enchantment provides different bonuses depending on which slot there are equipped to. These also have ranks and start from 1 and ends at 9. Four of the same kind may also fuse to move up a tier. The chance of success starts at 95% at rank 1 and 10% at rank 8. You will lose a single Runestone/Enchantment upon failure.

There are two ways to circumvent failure: Preservation Ward and Coalescent Ward. Preservation Wards cost 10 cents each and prevent the loss of materials upon failure. They are also only consumed upon failure. Coalescent Wards cost 10 dollars and guarantees success of fusion. [Both these wards may also be obtained on a weekly basis through Celestial Coins (the latter being rarer)](http://i.imgur.com/d4ptd4R.png). Now you may be wondering why there's a huge discrepancy between the two Wards. I was wondering for a while too until I stepped my foot into endgame and found out there was an entirely different type of Enchantments: The Armor/Weapon Enchantments.

Armor/Weapon Enchantments are for specific slots in your weapon/chest and grant special effects. They come in shards and have a chance to drop from Epic Dungeon bosses. You must combine 4 shards to create a Lesser version of the Enchantment. [However, the success chance of fusion is at a staggeringly low 1%](http://imgur.com/RSHW1mJ). To compensate, they have very strong effects. An example would be the [Thunderhead Enchantment](http://imgur.com/ZMBmsME). However, the real kicker here is that these ""Lesser"" versions may be fused again to gain a stronger version. Those may also be fused again to create the strongest version. Ultimately, the Greater Thunderhead Enchantment will have a 30% on crit to damage and stun foes. To create the strongest Enchantment possible, it will cost **160 dollars** and 64 shards. Unlike companions, these **can be used in PvP.**

**8. Conclusion**

Cryptic wasn't lying when they said this game was 100% F2P. I have done all content on a GF and a DC without fancy Enchantments or Scrolls of Mass Life. However, I fear that a few weeks down the road, players who have paid vast amounts of money will have an incredibly unfair advantage in PvP, including the Gauntlgrym content they have yet to release. And while it is true that you can always buy Zen with Astral Diamonds, simply doing quests/professions/skirmishes is nowhere enough to realistically sustain yourself. I have tried and it is far too difficult to reach 24,000 rough astral diamonds on a daily basis. On Mindflayer, it currently costs 435,000 Astral Diamonds for 10 dollars worth of Zen. I'm sure the market will stabilize soon, but even then it will take non-paying players to take upwards of two weeks to upgrade a single Enchantment.

Any complaints/advice/death threats are welcome. Hope this helps.

1369270373.0,327,self.Neverwinter,1evg2l,I supported Neverwinter.. $2860 to be exact.,dejavu627,406,79,277,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1evg2l/i_supported_neverwinter_2860_to_be_exact/,"Hi, before you comment about how much I've spent on this game please know: I'm 25 running my own business, I work at least 12 hours a day so I have less than a couple of hours a day to play games, I look after and support my brother's education and this was the first game I've spent so much time and money on. I love DnD.. and as soon as I heard about this game I put in the $200 to buy the founders pack. I had so much fun in beta trying out all the classes, it was really amazing. I ended up in an awesome casual guild who are active most nights of the week and we'd do some pvp or dungeons together.

Well on 20/05/13 (Aus format) I charged $200 because I was running low on some AD. After work I got home but it was getting late so I decided to open some keys to get enough bars for a twilight horse and also sell some greater bags on the AH. To my surprise people were offering A LOT of AD for these items all of a sudden but it was getting late, I quickly put the items onto the AH at whatever it automatic price it generated and logged off. The next day I woke up, I found out about the whole AD situation.. but didn't care for it because I mean.. did I exploit the game? No.

I was watching some streams on twitch and surfing the forums and saw posts saying people who got banned received an email about it. So I was certain everything was okay.. I tried logging on when servers were finally up. Guess what? 'Your account has been banned'.
I immediately went onto forums to find out what was going on and looked through Facebook. I saw a few posts by either mods or the admin saying that if you didn't receive an email about your ban, report it to customer services. I did this right away and later that day.. still no reason on my ban but my PWE account was banned due to me reporting about my ban.

Anyways here's proof of my purchases made to PWE:

http://puu.sh/2WVz5.png 

Everywhere I go, everytime I post on FB, I'm ignored by the reps now. Mods would close my threads and tell me to email customer service which hasn't worked yet. I'm not asking for my money back.. but I just want to warn people that this is their ways of management/operating and money spent on their services would be at your own risk I guess. :/
PS: I'm still going to stick around and see if PWE does answer or unban me due to an improper ban. All I want to do is enjoy the game with my mates again.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_1evg2l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1evg2l/i_supported_neverwinter_2860_to_be_exact/,

* You can pick any name you like, it doesn't have to be unique.  You have a unique name generated for you which is CharacterName@AccountName.

* Your choice of god/city/etc. doesn't seem to matter.

* The 'rolled' stats are not random, there are a set few to choose from - pick one that suits your character.

* If you mouse over any stat in your character screen it'll give you all sorts of details about it, so you can understand how all your gear/skills effect you.

* You can pick a title by pressing the edit profile button on your character details window.  You earn titles by completeing achievements.

* Always make sure you have enough potions for an adventure.  Eventually you'll have loads from drops, but early on you might not so only use them when you have to (50% health).

* The first set of feats (on the left) you can invest in any way you want, every point you put in will push along the progress bar and unlock the next tier.  The right feats work in a similar way, but each of the three branches is separate.  So, to get a second tier feat in one branch you need to invest 5 points in that branch.  You can still invest in the other branches though, but you unlock their tiers separately.

* If you stand next to a camp fire for a few seconds or so you'll get two good buffs as well as healed.

* You get two character slots per account for free, but you can create as many accounts as you like.

* When *Control Wizards* get to level 10 you unlock the special power slot (TAB by default) which allows you to have one upgraded version of an encounter power, details at the bottom of the power's description.

* You can drag powers from your power selection screen to your hotbar.  There is an 8 second cooldown, however this is sufficiently short a time that you can swap for key encounters - i.e. switch powers for dealing with a boss.

* If you die you become injured which slows you down and can weaken you, use injury kits to remove the injury.  Always have several injury kits on you when attempting dungeons, particularly from the mad dragon onwards.

* Don't respec while levelling up, wait until you're 60 then do it.  It's quick to level in this game, so having a few points here and there in less than optimal positions is no bother.

*Quests*

* You can access skirmishes, dungeons, and foundry (user-made) content from the in-game home page (shortcut L by default).

* You can also access the daily quests from the home page, the big icon in the bottom right.

* Lore that you find goes into your Journal (shortcut J), in the far right tab.  It's broken down by area but unfortunately is not ordered within each section.

* There are achievements in the middle tab of your journal, there is a tick box to also show those that you have attained already.

* If you feel you're over-levelled for an area you can go to Sergeant Knox in the Protectors Enclave to get the next quest line in the next area.

* Going into deep water will kill you instantly (beware in the lizard man area).

* Dungeons from the Mad Dragon onwards are generally much, much harder than anything you've done in game until that point.

* If you're on a quest to kill X of something (and you will be, a lot) if you meet other players and you kill them together, you all get the kills count against your quest.  So it's good to help people out, particularly when they're struggling.

*Companions*

* You'll eventually get to buy a companion for 2G as part of a quest.  (Apparently you can get your first free, but somehow I missed that).

* To level extra companions hassle free, just switch to them before handing in your quests, then switch back.

* Pick the companion that you think will best fit your playstyle.  For example, as a ranged Control Wizard my favorite companion is the man-at-arms as he tanks mobs while I blast them.

* Different companions are useful in different circumstances, in particular in dungeons I use a cleric for healing rather than a man-at-arms for tanking.

* You can switch instantly, so if you're not running with a cleric by default you can switch to your cleric to get healed, then switch them back.

* In the last areas (level 58+) my man-at-arms was being put down way too quickly so swapped to a cleric and things went more smoothly.

*Mounts*

* You can buy a mount for 5G, which you should have together around level 20-25.  You'll get 15 hours of mount rental at level 20 which will hold you until you have the cash.

* You can sell mounts in the auction house, which is currently a nice way to turn gold into AD.

* Standard mounts will increase your movement speed by 50%, anything more (up to 110%) costs a massive amount to get.

* This isn't an open world like other MMO games, so a mount is less important - but still useful.

*Items*

* If you have two items that are the same but one is bound to you and the other is not, they will not stack.

* Some items that say 'cannot sell' on them, can in fact be sold through the auction house.  For example, the bounty tokens you collect in each area.

* Skill kits are very useful, when you can afford it pick up 5 to 10 of each so you don't run out - you don't need one type depending on your class.

* There are three different levels of identification scroll needed to identify different level bands of gear (1-29, 30-59, 60).  These are common drops, but when you're on the border you won't have enough of the higher tier ones.  You can buy them from the AD store (see below).

* You can access the AD store anywhere by going to your inventory, going to the money tab, then clicking the Spend button next to the Astral Diamonds.  This is only really useful for identification scrolls at the moment.

* You'll get another bag eventually (total of two additional), but if you want more space you have to pay heavily for it.

* There is very little to spend gold on, it's mainly used for health potions and injury kits.  Mounts are 5G, companions 2G, and there are profession items to spend on now and again.  So there is no real need to skimp on potions or anything else you need.

* Your three hot-bar item slots (for potions, etc.) are actually inventory slots too, dragging items here will remove them from your inventory.

* You won't get any gear that looks different until level 20-25.

* 25 Power = 1 Damage

* Each AC on gear = 0.5% Damage reduction

* Save your AD, good level 60 gear is expensive!

*Auction House/Mail*

* You can access the auction house to sell/buy from anywhere by pressing the hammer icon along the top, then pressing 'More like this' on one of the items.  You can't pick up bought items though, you have to go to the post man.

* The game is new so prices fluctuate wildly.

* Put a buy it now price on low level (&lt; 60) items, they're only good for a few levels of play max.. by the time someone wins the auction, it'll be no good for them.

* Ultimately I stopped selling low level (&lt;60) gear, it just doesn't sell.  Enchants/runes/profession stuff/horses are the way to go.

* You can end an auction you're running at any time and the item will go straight into your inventory (not through post).

* When you sell stacks you sell them as a stack, so use SHIFT + DRAG to split items in your inventory first if you want to sell them separately.

* If you think ""wow, these are selling for a lot!"" it's because the auction house recommended price thingy has messed up.  Double-check prices by searching for the item yourself.  You're not going to sell a skill kit for 200K sadly.

* When you delete a mail message it will create duplicate entries for all your mail messages.  Deleting a message will delete it and its duplicate.  Because of this I've taken to going through all my mail to get all my cash/items, then delete it all after.

*Enchantments/Runes*

* If you double click a stack of 4 or more you get a fuse interface where you have a chance to combining four into 1 of the next rank up.

* Unless you're desperately struggling, enchantments are too expensive to use as you're levelling up for the small advantage they give.  You'll only have gear for a few levels before moving on, and it costs you to remove them.

* There is no point in collecting these early on to fuse, later in the game the higher level ones are common drops.  You can instead sell them in the AH for reasonable amounts (better than most gear), the rest for gold.

*Professions*

* Levelling these up is time-based, so start as soon as you can (Level 10) if you want to do this.

* Currently in the crafting professions you'll not get much other than under-clothes that are actually useful (all the gear is terrible).  Hopefully this will change in the future, but for now I wouldn't waste too much time messing with it.

* You can access this interface through a web browser: http://gateway.playneverwinter.com/

* Leadership is a good one to invest in early as it doesn't require any resources, allowing you to quickly open up the other slots while gaining some XP/cash.

* Skill kits are your best source of materials, but some can be purchased at the market if needed.

* The profession item retailer in the market has two tabs, the second tab contains one-time purchase implements you'll need such as hammers, shears, etc.

*Combat*

* Combat is skill based, so it'll take practice to get good at it.

* Always pull the boss out of the room they start in if possible, so when their adds appear they don't join the fight.

* Always focus on taking down the most annoying thing first, then the next, and so on.

* Some areas will be filled with packs you find it hard to deal with, it's just a matter of working out the best way of handling them - there's always a way.  Try different skills, companions, tactics, etc.  If you still can't do it, ask for help/come back later.

* You can just walk out of red markers if you do it quick enough to save stamina for when you really need it.

* Buff powers will turn off when you go between an instance and non-instance, so always make sure you have these on when you change areas.

* Powers that knock targets combined with large drops can be a very quick way of dealing with nasty enemies.

* Some monsters are immune to various forms of control and knockback.

* Pop one of every buff potion before going into a boss fight/tough encounter, particularly in dungeons.

*Misc*

* When you reach level 15 you can use the Foundry to create your own quests.  There is a button on the character selection screen.  There isn't much in the way of documentation / tutorials about this yet, but more is coming all the time and official stuff will likely come soon.

&gt;* Update 12PM Pacific: We are still investigating the situation. There is a high likelihood that we will be performing character-specific rollbacks on any accounts that were found to be utilizing the exploit. Additionally, we are investigating the extent of what can additional steps can be taken to remove any illegitimately obtained Astral Diamonds that have entered into the economy. We are also investigating the possibility of a shard-wide rollback.


&gt;* Update 12:15PM Pacific: We're bringing the shards down temporarily to better investigate the issue. Estimated downtime is 1 hour. Thank you!


&gt;* Update 12:45PM Pacific: We're still investigating the issue and will have more information for you as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience!


&gt;* Update 12:55PM Pacific: The shard downtime will be extended for two more hours as we address the AD/AH issue. More details soon - thank you!


&gt;* Update 1:30PM Pacific: We are identifying the accounts that have utilized the AH exploit and will be taking action against said accounts. We are also still investigating the severity of the issue and its impact on the game, and from this information we will take corrective action. Estimated downtime is at least two more hours. We’ll have more updates for you soon. Thanks for your support and patience as we continue smoothing things out during Open Beta!


&gt;* Update 2:00PM Pacific: We're still investigating and should have more information soon. Thanks for sticking with us!


&gt;* Update 2:30PM Pacific: We're still working on resolving the AH/AD issue and are making great progress. Thanks for your patience!


&gt;* Update 3:00PM Pacific: We're hoping to have more info for you soon, and are still working on the issue. Thanks!

&gt;*  Update ~4:00pm Pacific: I will be AFK for about 40 minutes, but will return then, and will hopefully have more information. Thank you all for your patience!  ~~(from twitter forum edit seems to have messed up the formating of the post.)~~ [Clearly the reason OP went AFK](http://puu.sh/2WZ4X/7804125976.png)


**edit:** 5:10pm Pacific: twitter feed responding to tweets again, seems OP is back, no update yet. [Here's the tweet](http://puu.sh/2X1jA/58be2ddc6b.png) 

&gt;* Update 5:15 PM Pacific: We have most of the information in-hand, but are waiting on a few final details to determine our plan of action. To clarify one thing I've seen around on Twitter, whatever we ultimately decide to do, a full character wipe will not happen. We're doing everything we can to minimize the impact of this fix, so that it changes what must change, but not much else. Thank you all for your patience, we appreciate it and will have you back in-game as soon as possible.

 The above thanks to /u/Kaspanova

**edit:** 5:45pm Pacific. [From twitter](http://puu.sh/2X2rZ/fab1830efd.png) the implication here is that there is/are option(s) on the table that would involve some kind of roll back. Also it seems the downtime will continue for (what I assume means) at least an hour. [source](http://puu.sh/2X2w9/3dc70d4570.png)

&gt;* From Twitter 6:00pm Pacific. We're finalizing the plan, but I don't feel comfortable posting anything until we're sure. Sorry for the delay on this

&gt;* Update 6 PM Pacific(From forums): We're still finalizing the plan of action. Once everything is locked in, we'll be posting everything, so keep your eyes on Facebook, on Twitter and on our forums -- we'll make sure it goes everywhere. Thank you all again, we appreciate your support and patience.

**edit:** 6:37pm Pacific  - [Soon ^tm](http://puu.sh/2X4iz/3552e1bb1c.png)

&gt;* Update 6:35pm Pacific (how does time work? I guess refresh lag): We have a plan of action. We're verifying the exact timeline with the Neverwinter team, then we'll be triple-checking the planned forum post with all key stakeholders before posting. We're not finished yet, folks, but we're getting closer.

**edit:** 7:00pm Pacific [More soon^tm](http://puu.sh/2X4Yj/5af96c121c.png) Twitter feed went from multiple tweets per minuet to nothing, we can only hope the Community Manager is working on another forum update :)

**edit:** 7:35pm Pacific [Decision made](http://puu.sh/2X6dr/1a7770e9d7.png) looks like just waiting on approval from higher-ups to make it public and announce ETA.

**edit:** 7:55pm Pacific. Roughly 20 minuets since any twitter chatter from the Community Manager. Last we heard, the plan was decided upon, hope the AFK is a sign of moving something forward.

**edit:**  8:10pm Pacific [From Twitter](http://puu.sh/2X7iF/d01d75e986.png) 

 We should have a post on the plan within 30 minuets, however servers will not be up then. If I had to wager a guess, I would (optimistically) say 1hr after the announcement.


&gt;* 8:27pm Pacific - Thanks for your support, everyone. Finalizing the post about what our action plan is, stay tuned just a little longer.

&gt;* Update 9 PM Pacific: The post about our plan of action is being confirmed -- stay tuned, folks, we're getting closer.

**edit:** 9:21pm Pacific: [from twitter](http://puu.sh/2X9pW/f65118e214.png) sarcasm aside this looks like a hard deadline on at least telling us whats going to happen.

**edit** [The very vague ETA](http://puu.sh/2XcoW/313513bfa9.png)

From /u/postatyourownrisk  

[Bugs that were know, according to forum posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1enkyb/cryptic_and_perfect_world_are_incompetent_closed/)

&gt;**1** - AH exploit - This is what all the current fuss is about. Too bad it was discovered and reported in closed beta, only to still make it in. Through this exploit one can earn unlimited AD and simply clean out the AD vendors, as well as buy up all the Zen they wanted. I knew about it and reported it on the day that I logged in. My ticket was closed and marked as resolved. Upon reading it further, I noticed that a GM told me the ticket was lost and to resubmit it. I did and kept playing. The second ticket was closed and ""lost again"". So I gave up reporting it.

&gt;**2** - Quest sharing exploit - This allowed you to reach level 60 in about an hour of playing. It also allowed people to farm unlimited bags, assets, and materials. It was discovered and reported in closed beta, but still made it in to the open beta. Once again, I made a ticket about it only to have it closed. My follow up ticket was also closed.

&gt;**3** - Foundry bugs - Were used to gain max level and farm gear. Although I knew about this bug, I did not report it because I thought the other two were more important.

&gt;**4** - The CW set bonus bug allowing them to hit for millions points of damage. This was a very minor bug, but it still allowed a team of two or more CW's to farm end game content. I did not know about this bug, but plenty of people in my guild did.

&gt;**5** - The GF set bug - Yet another set bug that allowed the GF to almost instantly kill any mob in the game. A lot more consistent than the CW set bug, and caused a lot of damage to the economy. I knew about this a few days into the game, but decided not to report it since my other tickets kept being closed and ""lost"".

&gt;**6** - Chest farming exploits - These are still in the game and allow people to farm easy money, as well as gear and ingredients.

&gt;**7** - There is already a bot out for Neverwinter that members of Tault Unleashed have been using. Currently it can be made to level or exploit chests. They are working on having it take care of professions and auto pray for you as well.

&gt;**8** - TR DC bug - this was used mostly in PvP to instantly disconnect anyone the TR targeted with certain abilities. It allowed all TR groups to quickly win matches in the least amount of time possible.

&gt;**9** - Potion exploit - Basically you can have unlimited healing potions - not much of an exploit since you can accomplish the same thing easier by using any other AD earning exploit and buying potions.

&gt;**10** - AutoHotkey - Macro software that allows you to easily max your crafting.

&gt;**11** - AFK PvP groups - creating a few accounts and making an AFK group (managed by AutoHotkey or the Viper bot), you can quickly earn XP and gear while you sleep.

&gt;**12** - Their support site has not worked since launch. That's right, you can't even request a refund or report bugs through that thing! it gets stuck in an infinite loop after you log in to submit a ticket.

&gt;**13** - Dungeon exploits - There are plenty of ways to exploit dungeons to severely shorten the time required to beat them. Reaching the end boss can be cut down from 45+ minutes, to less than 5.

&gt;**14** - Boss exploits - Easily kill dungeon bosses over and over for loot and seals, then reset them and do it again. 

&gt;**15** - There is another armor set bug which gives everyone in the party stats that are above and beyond what you can get without cheating.

**edit**  from /u/tobascodagama concerning the fact that these bugs were known, and tickets about them were being closed.
&gt;  ""The best explanation is that those bugs were already in the bug tracker, and the deleted reports were considered not to have any more information than already existed in the system.""


**edit:** We are nearing an hour since the last PW update(not including responses to tweets) [I found this](http://puu.sh/2WYxn/7c004b981f.png) on thier official twitter feed [here](https://twitter.com/NeverwinterGame)

[Again, and very straight foreward](http://puu.sh/2WYI4/bea7acb0be.png)


**edit:** We seem to have 40 minuets on our hand with witch to speculate. Personally, and this is pure speculation, I think they are working on item only rollbacks or something along those lines.

**edit:** [Good Guy Community Manager](http://puu.sh/2X2U3/83879f51c6.png) I don't know why but I liked this enough to post and edit for it.

**edit:** [We're being watched . . .](http://puu.sh/2X3eP/7dfb554ea2.png) :P

By the way guys forum traffic is high for them right now, if you are on it, I promise I'll let you know whats going down. If you like, closing your forums window would help out people not watching this thread to get to the forums.

**edit:** well its been fun, and now we at least know what they are doing, keeping an eye on [their twitter feed](https://twitter.com/NeverwinterGame) would be the best way to find a more percise ETA then ""later this evening"".

Not much more to say. Just makes the game frustrating for everyone and shows how pathetically low this company will stoop when monetizing their game.

I don't mind you selling cool looking mounts/pets/ect. That's an example of what paid content should look like. It should be fun/cosmetic AND IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT TO DO (side note: $30-40 for a mount is hilariously dumb, but I digress). It shouldn't be something people get 0 enjoyment from but feel they have to do or be at a disadvantage.

I really hate that a game with a lot of potential can be killed entirely by a bad business model, but that's exactly what I see happening here. Usually I'd accept the criticism that I'm being overly cynical, but with this game it really does seem painfully obvious to EVERYONE how overboard batshit crazy they've gone with monetization and money-grubbing.

Here's to looking to the future and hoping the game improves drastically in this regard..otherwise &amp; unfortunately, I'll likely see you at the launch of the next failed game inevitably killed by greed and bad business. :)",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1368788791.0,,,True,t3_1eieiy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1eieiy/paying_for_respecs_wards_needs_to_go/,

It has all the files needed for the base game it self and character creation. Every time you join a new map or instance, it'll have a download bar at top. Sometimes it's unbearable and annoying. Some are very small downloads. Usually the lower level maps are quick to download and the later maps take a long time.

To download the rest of the assets and files simply load up your launcher &gt; Options &gt; Disable on-demand patching

Then it should start downloading 1.8GB-2GB worth of files. 

I'm not exactly sure if this will completely remove download of foundry maps as it's a player made map but it will have all the assets ready to be used.

The function is actually a great idea. Especially people who play casually and want to save some bandwidth for data they probably won't use for a long time.

Not sure if it's known but it doesn't hurt having a re-post. I tried searching for a post but, reddit's search function...

I'm not trying to say that that there are *no* problems, I'm just trying to say that the effort we put into these posts should be more constructive; should lead to *actual progress and results.*

I propose that every week we put up a blanket post for everyone to throw their issues and ideas on how to fix them into.  Then we ship it off to Cryptic.  If they listen, great!  If they don't, ...

I'm sure this post won't go anywhere, but if it gets enough hits/support today, I'll go ahead and post the first ""collection post"" today.  If it flops, then I'll crawl back into my cave.

**TLDR: Instead of complaining, let's have a weekly post to organize all of our issues and ideas for fixes into, then send it to Cryptic.**

**EDIT/UPDATE:**  This is a great series of responses.  Either tonight or tomorrow morning I'll write up a Google Doc with all of the awesome ideas here and post it for Reddit approval before emailing it to Cryptic. 

**EDIT 2:**  Also, if you bring up a specific post (i.e the $160 enchantment breakdown), please link it.  If not for anything else than for me to source in the Document.

**UPDATE** It's about 10:45pm EST (May 7th).  I'm going to begin jotting everything down that's in the post as of right now.  Any further ideas, please PM them to me and I'll work them in.  It will end up being broken down categorically (PvP, Foundry, Currency, etc...) and in short bullet points.  I'll finish up the organization of the document, add a cover letter, and post it tomorrow for Reddit review before emailing it out (if anyone has a decent contact to send it to that isn't visible on their website, that would be much appreciated).  Again, thank you all for the suggestions.  It seems that a lot of their player base is here and makes me believe that they will lend us their ear.  Goodnight!

So I trawled the AH and the zone chats to piece together what I could into the spreadsheet below. It contains details on the five named item sets that I could find. There are other sets, such as the 'Arcane Overseer' which gives the exact same stats as the 'High Vizier' but lacks the set bonus. I've only listed sets that have a bonus. Sets consist of the Cap, Tunic, Gloves and Boots. For this reason the Orbs and Talismans are listed separately.

There are a couple of items that I could not find and so are missing their stats, it would be great if someone could fill them in if possible. Make sure it's the standard item's stats though, not the Seal versions.

Also if there are any other sets that I missed, feel free to add them in too.

1368211566.0,96,self.Neverwinter,1e31fo,How I made over 1.5m AD in one day and how to take advantage of the AH early on in the game,adgloriam,235,139,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e31fo/how_i_made_over_15m_ad_in_one_day_and_how_to_take/,"Hi There, 

I was contemplating quite a bit on whether I should create this post, but given the fact that I most likely won't be playing this game after May, decided to share it with the rest of the community. 

The method that I used was incredibly easy to spot, but, surprisingly, not a lot of people were actually using it. It involved weapon/armor enchantments and, in particular, fusing them and selling back on the AH.
See, the arbitrage was that the price of individual Shards required to make specific weapon/armor enchantments was somewhat low in certain cases, and the combined cost of crafting it was maybe 70% of what the Lesser, and all subsequent tiers, enchantments were selling for.

So I spend maybe 4 hours yesterday doing this, started off with the plain thunderhead enchantment, bought 4 for about 25k each, spent some time sniping the coalescent ward for about 100k (once found it for 18k), fused them and got one lesser thunderhead enchantment. The lowest price on the AH for that item was 450k. The key to a successful sale was to substantially undercut it. So I listed it for 389,999 and it sold within an hour.
After the first successful sale I decided to do a bit more search on the AH, and then created a spreadsheet that outlined costs/profits (link below). After inputting all possible enchantments, I focused on those that resulted in NI of at least 100k AD.  Made around 6 more sales in the course of maybe 5-6 hours and had accumulated approximately 1.4m AD in total (I had a little less than 600k AD from the founder's pack). 

After that I decided to take it to the next level, and started researching the normal enchantments (required 4 lesser ones). Unsurprisingly, the scarcity of these items resulted in outrageous prices of maybe 4-5x the actual cost. I was not that greedy and thought that as long as I end up making about 2x my initial investment I would go for it. Given the fact that finding cheap coalescent wards is a somewhat time consuming process, I decided to make 2 lesser enchantments by crafting them and two more I will just buy (payed maybe around 90k AD more than the crafting cost for each). Total crafting cost for that item ended up being around 1.3m and I decided to sell it for 2.7m (at that time there were 4 items of this kind in total, cheapest one was listed for 3.9m or something like that). It was around 2am, so I decided to go to sleep. Next day I woke up and found 2.43m in my mail (mind the AH tax ~ 12%).

After checking the prices for shards/wards/enchantments today it became pretty obvious that the arbitrage is still there, however, the prices fluctuate a lot (some went down by a significant amount, some remained the same). Felt pretty good to have that amount in my bank, but I didn't feel like keep going after that, since I was already fully geared (GS 9.5k) and accumulating as much AD as possible to be able to purchase better gear later on was not my goal (told myself I'd never do that again after D3). So I thought I'd share it with you guys, hopefully people found this post interesting, despite the length. All in all, the key to success is observation and understanding the majority of your market (approximate wealth, time, likeliness of making inefficient decisions, etc.)

On a side note, I'd like to warn anyone that if you decide to replicate this scheme, be mindful of the consequences. When I was spending all my AD on it, I was fully aware of all the risks and knew that the items might not sell and I might end up losing a significant portion of my AD. 

TL;DR more than tripled my AD in one day selling enchantments.

Here is a link to a spreadsheet (this one only shows the number, but I'll post the one with formulas in it once I figure out how to properly use google drive)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Atkyn0rWFkcldHhNamNfbURILWpOOThpTTZmWks0VXc&amp;output=html

All the prices were valid as of yesterday, and as I checked them today most of them changed by a good amount, so be mindful of that.

Cheers

Nope. Instead they fixed some quest sharing bug to achieve more bag space.

This needs more attention and spreading around so they freaking fix it already. The market is already ruined. Castle Never items now go for less than T2 dungeon items.

There is something wrong with PVP scaling, I 100% confirmed it last night. I noticed as I leveled in pvp from 54-60 that my damage was going down every time I leveled.

AS SOON AS I HIT LEVEL 59 ALL MY DAMAGE CAME BACK AND IT WAS FIXED.

I based these numbers off my cleave, I am a guardian fighter. ALL MY SKILLS WERE DOING LOWER DAMAGE. 

Outside of PVP Cleave Damage:

LVL54 586-616

LVL55 586-616

LVL56 586-616

LVL57 586-616

As you can see, something with the level scaling in PVP that takes you to 59 (I am not sure about other brackets), is horribly broken.

PVPing at level 58 I was completely useless. I was critting my hardest hitting ability for 1k. As soon as I hit 59, I was throwing out 6k++ crits again.

Save healing potions for boss fights &amp; dire emergencies.  See surviving tips below.  Dieing &amp; resetting back to spawn point in levels lower than 20 is no big deal either.

Save all your money &amp; spend only on things in this order: mount, 2nd companion (to rotate when training primary), 3rd companion (backup when other 2 are training), then keep 7+ of the 4 kits on you at all times, &amp; use them liberally.  Rarely should you need to spend gold for anything else.

Save your kits to open stuff until level 20 when you start getting decent enchantments.

#### 2: Be smart about how you play

Engage in fights smartly; pull/rush/sneak, let your ranged DPS get a few hits in, CC, then engage.

Be smart about dealing with groups of mobs; focus on killing 1 at a time (even if using AoE) &amp; keep the rest CC'd &amp; away from you.

Find out what sequence of castings work best for the mobs you're playing &amp; your style.  There is a spell rotation that works best for your class; find it &amp; use it.

Find a cool player to party with.  &amp; be nice &amp; helpful on how you play.

Don't complain how NwO is Pay2Win, another class is too OP, etc.  The problem is likely on your end.  Plus one OP class at level 15 might be average at 30.

#### 3: Maximize on how you use your gear.

Keep empty spaces in your bag; trade with party mates liberally, sell often, use your hotbar &amp; companion as extra bag slots, &amp; bank when getting full.

Right click over all your gear to find out what you can do to it.

IMHO using level 1 enchantments are a waste; combine 4 into the next level &amp; use the highest level that you can.

Rotate your companions.

Hit difficult dungeons or use your coins when your gear is starting to look weak.

#### 4: Have different expectations

Always-full health bars might be in other games, but not this one.  Sorry!

Don't expect clerics to be the one to keep you alive.  No matter your class, *you* (currently) have **EIGHT different ways of staying alive longer**; choose 3-5 &amp; do them well &amp; you'll survive to the next healing fire/altar.  In priority:

 * Avoid damage (jump off red circles, watch the enemy's actions, move around, CC...)
 * Play with a party.  ++ if using voice chat ([v], but TeamSpeak is far better)
 * Cleric NPC companion (she's a permanent Heal Over Time, &amp; occasional meat-shield.  The Man-At-Arms is OK also, not as good)
 * LifeSteal stat (from equipment; good health regain IF you have good DPS)
 * regeneration stat (from equipment; slow trickle of out-of combat health; helps keep you topped off)
 * Higher AC/damage reduction stats &amp; abilities 
 * Drop a healing altar (between permanent altars, &amp; might as well Invoke &amp; tweak equipment while waiting to heal)
 * Healing potions (use emergency-only &amp; you'll have enough)

Mouse targeting is different from [Tab]-targeting.  More fluid, though requires more skills.  Holding [CTRL] locks on your target.

This is a free2play game, don't expect 1000s of different type of weapons, classes, monsters, maps, etc at launch.   More may come in time if people will spend money &amp; turn NwO a profit.  Advantage is you can choose time or money on how you buy your fun.

1368545131.0,69,self.Neverwinter,1ebh17,"Details of the possible Pay 2 Win aspects (No rants, just an objective writeup)",Avalyst,92,23,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1ebh17/details_of_the_possible_pay_2_win_aspects_no/,"So there's been a lot of talk back and forth about P2W or not P2W, about wards for $160 and so on. However, this whole discussion seriously lacks objectivity, so I will try and provide some cold hard facts and let everyone make up their own mind. Here goes:


**Background**

There are two types of enchantments in the game at level 60. First of all there are the enchantments you get while leveling and that you can put into items from around level 20-30. Second a special type of enchant that comes in two flavors: Armor and Weapon. These can only be inserted into certain level 60 epic items. The thing about enchants is that they improve your stats greatly, they are not just a minor buff. In fact, they give a greater improvement than the armor itself (Not counting set bonuses).

*Example*

As an example I will take the two chest pieces for Control Wizards (Since that's what I play) that are bought with seals. Looking at each stat's improvement between the two armor pieces you will see that they are roughly 10%-20% for the stats that matter. Picking Recovery as a sample stat, the T1 has 382 Recovery and the T2 has 403, an improvement of 21 Recovery or 5%. Now contrast this to slotting a Recovery enchantment (Called Silvery) in an Offense slot (Granted the particular armor doesn't have this type of slot, I picked it since it's a major source of stats). A Rank 4 enchantment gives 90 Recovery whereas the Rank 5 gives 120, an improvement of roughly 30% and this is not even taking the higher ranks into consideration. And if you compare it to the item, a Rank 5 enchantment gives you about 50% of what the T1 armor gives.

The point of this example was to prove that enchantments are a big deal, they greatly improve your character and you will need them if you want to be competitive. If you want to take a more relaxed approach to the game you might be alright with lower ranks, although that remains to be seen once the Raid content comes out which Cryptic said would be so hard they shouldn't be able to beat it in-house (Source: [WTF is...? Neverwinter by TotalBiscuit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0E6Yw-M1YY))


**Enchantments (Colored offense/defense/utility)**

As mentioned previously, these enchantments drop continuously during your leveling and will also be found in dungeon chests as well as in foundries and general mobs in the world.
You can merge 4 of the same rank to get 1 of a higher rank, like so:

4x Rank 1 = 1x Rank 2

4x Rank 2 = 1x Rank 3 = 16x Rank 1

etc...

In total there are ~~7 ranks~~ 9 ranks (Corrected by *beanso* and also [proof](http://i.imgur.com/dPPUv0i.jpg?1)), adding up to 65536 Rank 1 for a single Rank 9. However, each fuse comes with a lower chance of success, starting at 95% from Rank 1 -&gt; Rank 2, going down to 90%, then 85%, then 60% and then even lower. So statistically it will take a lot more of these to get to Rank 9. However there exists an item in the Zen shop for 1000 zen (Roughly $10) which guarantees success. This item is also buyable with Astral Diamonds at rather affordable prices on auctions.


**Weapon and armor enchantments**

These enchantments are another story. First of all their source, they can only be found in dungeons, more notably only on bosses and in the Dungeon Delves event chest. They are always of rare quality (Blue) or upwards, hence requiring a roll if dropped from a boss. The second big difference is how they are created, the drops in instances are shards, useless on their own, which can be merged to a ""Lesser"" version of the enchant. These can then be merged to a ""Normal"" and then a ""Greater"" like so:

4x Shards = 1x Lesser

4x Lesser = 1x Normal = 16x Shards

4x Normal = 1x Greater = 64x Shards

In other words it takes you at least 64 shards to get a single Greater. It does however not end here, each of these merges have  a 1% chance of success, in reality requiring a ward. This sparked the so-called $160 rumor since it would require a lot of wards. ~~Considering my earlier statement about the ward prices the $160 number is a bit off, and wards aren't the big deal.~~ (See edit about wards)

*Warning: Math and statistics ahead!*

Now, there are a few people claiming that you can farm and you don't need wards. Let's have a look at some statistics. The probability of two independent events occurring at the same time is the probability of each event multiplied by the others (P_tot = P1 * P2). So the probability of merging shards to a Greater without failure is 0.01*0.01*0.01 = 0.000001 (Three merges, each at 1% success rate). That is 0.0001% or 1 ppm (Part Per Million). Put in layman's terms: ~~You need to merge a million times (Literally) to get what you want.~~This isn't entirely true, apparently it only goes up to around 63% ([Explaination](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1ebh17/details_of_the_possible_pay_2_win_aspects_no/c9yp1iz)) Admittedly, for each fail you only lose 1 of them which makes the exact calculation more complex and I feel the risk of me borking it up is too large, please comment away if you can do it and I'll put it up here with credits. :)
Either way, not using wards is not an option. Case closed.


**Conclusion**

~~The problem isn't in the wards. Let me rephrase that: Wards aren't that expensive, and you don't desperately need that many, you basically only need those for the Weapon and Armor enchants.~~ After it was pointed out that my math was off, you actually need 21 wards to make a Greater Enchantment, I retract this statement. Wards are also a part of the problem.

The major issue is the source of shards, since you get about 1-2 drops per dungeon, everyone always needs on all of them since it doesn't say what enchantment it will give, you have too look that up, so statistically you get 1 every 2 dungeons at best. Then there are 13 different kinds so the chance of you getting the one you actually want is kind of small. All in all, we're talking about years of farming if you don't want to spend cash at all and even if you elect to spend some (For wards) it's still a long way to go.

Now the obvious counter-argument here is that you can buy this stuff on AH. Let's have a look at some prices at the time of writing. Vorpal weapon enchantment is the one most (All?) DPS classes should want, it increases your crit severity by 12%/25%/50% (The last one is a guess, I have yet to see a greater). Another guess is that these aren't percent, they are percentage points ([Explanation of the difference](http://www.mathsisfun.com/percentage-points.html)), this may of course be completely false but either way it's a big improvement.
A shard costs 50-70K AD. Let's pretend that there are enough shards at 50K to make a Greater enchant (There isn't). That's a total of 3.2 million AD for the shards. Then you need wards as well, these cost around 150K AD and ~~you need 4 of them, totaling 600K~~. (Correction by *Krazed59*: You need 21, equaling an additional 3.15 millions) All in all that is ~~3.8 million~~ 6.35 million Astral Diamonds *at best*. Then of course you have to pay that again each time new content comes out because you will most likely get an improved weapon.

For the sake of full disclosure I have some points about this:

* The price I used in my calculation is unrealistically low at the moment, not enough cheap shards exist.

* The Vorpal enchantment is the most expensive of all enchantments (Probably because it's the one that's in highest demand)

* All prices can go anywhere, it's still early in beta

Although it's pretty clear that getting your hands on this stuff is unlikely unless you

* A: Pay for it

* B: Exploit

* C: Are very lucky and find rare loot that sells for a lot


**Full disclosure**

As might be appropriate, here are some facts about me that I would like to share for the sake of objectivity.

* I play CW

* I am level 60, more or less done with T1 and haven't touched T2 yet

* I've played several other MMOs including a metric tone of WoW (Vanilla, TBC, LK and haven't touched it since we slayed LK)

* I have not invested any money into this game yet (Waiting for thing to stabilize and for me to decide if I want to play or not)

* I don't like how the system is set up at the moment, I consider this (Albeit small) part of it Pay 2 Win

* So far this game has been fantastic gameplay-wise and the dungeons are somewhat challenging and a lot of fun

* I do not, in any way, shape or form, hate this game. Nor do I hate anyone here, even if you disagree with me, nor do I want it to shut down, fail or anything similar. I simply think this part of the business model is skewed *at the moment*. Note the italics, this might all change in a week, prices can go down and it won't be an issue any more.

* I am 100% OK with companies charging players for accelerating your progress in a game but the acceleration should be reasonable

* I am 110% OK with companies charging players for vanity items, cosmetic things and convenience items (Bags, bank slots etc)

* I picked a few facts and stats from [a thread about enchantments](http://nw-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?193232-Epic-Armor-amp-Weapon-Enchantments)

* I do not have a cat (Neither in-game nor IRL)

If you feel this section is missing something, ask away and I will answer and put it here if it's relevant.


**TL;DR**

Basically, all level 60 chest piece and weapon have a special enchantment slot that requires you to merge shards which are hard as hell to find (1 drop/instance run) and expensive on the AH (Approx. 3 million AD for the shards). The merging has a very low success rate (1% and you have to merge them from shards to Minor enchants to Normal to Greater, 3 merges). All in all, this means 21 wards at a total cost of approx. 3 million AD. In total 6 million AD if you want to buy them (Probably takes 6-12 months of farming) or 3 million AD for the wards if you want to farm the shards yourself. Note that this is only for one slot, if you want an enchantment in both your armor and weapon slot you have to do everything all over again.

In terms of $$$ 6 million AD is around $200 (300 AD/Zen on Dragon ATM, 100 Zen/$). Double that since you have two of these slots and you get $400 to buy everything, give or take. Since prices fluctuate and you might farm some of it and buy some of it YMMV but it's around a couple of 100 dollars either way.

While there are a few additional ways to get these wards, all of them will take at least around 6 months until you get what you need, most of them more. I recommend reading my conclusions as well as the edits.

**EDIT:** If you feel like downvoting, please share why. Think my facts are off? Correct me. Think my opinion of this is wrong? Debate it. Think the post is too long? Just leave it.

**Final note**

I did not post this to anger anyone, to be a dick or to prove a point. I posted it as just what it says it is, facts. If you can prove that something isn't correct I will happily change it and credit you.
I do not expect everyone to agree with me on this, I expect everyone to make up their own mind based on actual calculations and not rumors, rage posts or fanboism.

**EDIT**: To put it plain and simple, the reason why I think the armor/weapon enchantments are the issue and not so much the other ones is because the other enchantments drop from foundries and regular mobs. They are as a result quite easily farmable. It will still take a lot of time but it's more doable, especially considering that you usually get Rank 4 and upwards at level 60.

**EDIT 2:** As pointed out by *Krazed59* I was wrong when counting that you needed only 4 wards (Should have been 3 with my logic but that's beside the point). You actually need 21 wards for a fully upgraded enchant and that's a lot of money at $10 each if you want to buy them. I have updated my calculations accordingly.

**EDIT 3:** A point was brought up about how much time it would actually take to farm this. I wrote up a quick example but it has a flaw. I don't know the actual drop rate for Vorpals, if anyone knows please share. :)

&gt; ~~From what I reckon, having done only T1 and never seen a Vorpal they only drop from T2 dungeons.~~(They drop in T1 as well) On top of that, only one drops per instance, which everyone will most likely need on. Since there are 13 enchants that's 1/13 chance of getting the right drop (Provided they all drop at the same rate in all dungeons) and then an additional 1/5 chance of actually getting to loot it. That's about 1.5% chance per dungeon run, round that a bit and you get 100 runs per shard. Multiply with 64 and you get 6400 runs.

&gt; Not quite sure about how many runs per day are reasonable but let's take a really hard core example. You do dungeons at 30 mins/dungeon (Quite fast from what my impression of T2 is) and grind 8 hours a day, all days of the week (Basically make it your full-time job and then some). This means 16 dungeons/per day. Divide the 6400 dungeons with 16 and you get 1600 days or about 4.5 years.

&gt; Of course there is the possibility that certain dungeons only drop certain shards which means you can farm a specific one. Then you can do runs with guildies, increasing your chance of getting what you want. But the 30 mins/dungeon is a bit low I think and 8 hours per day on average is high for everyone except the most hard core guilds. All in all, we're not talking a month or two, we're talking a year or two.

**EDIT 4:** A counter-argument was made about the wards by Muscly_Geek that you can actually get wards from the 7 Celestial Coin reward. While it is true that I completely overlooked this, it's still a problem.

You still need 21 wards. At 1 ward/week (Which you won't get since it only ""often times contains a ward"") it will still take you 21 weeks or about 5 months to get that. Provided you can log in every single day because if you miss one your coins disappear.

While it does decrease the cost to some extent, it's still not reasonable. And then of course you need the shards anyway.

An additional point about this was made that you can just create a bunch of accounts and farm prayers to increase your chance of getting wards. While this is true, it is probably against the ToS and if it's discovered you probably risk a ban. And of course the issue of shards remain.

While the game itself will not let you directly apply dye to your weapons, the coding for it is 100% there, including full application of kits and application of single dye bottles to primary, secondary, or accent slots.

To pull this off, open the change appearance tab on a piece of armor and slot the dye in as if you're going to dye it. Now go to your character screen and right click on the weapon you'd like to dye and select change appearance. This will replace the armor in your current change appearance window with the weapon and bypass the ""Weapons cannot be dyed"" message that usually appears.

Click to apply, and ta-da, you have a dyed weapon. For DCs and CWs the results come out a little weird sometimes, but it still works.

Here's a screenshot of red dye applied to the primary and secondary slots on the Greycloak's Legacy Greatsword from the founder pack on one of my lowbies.

###**I. Introduction**

[Neverwinter](http://nw.perfectworld.com/) is a free-to-play fantasy MMO based in Faerûn, the main continent of the Forgotten Realms, arguably the most well-known D&amp;D campaign setting. I won't go too much into detail here so I don't get all D&amp;D nerdy and forget the point of the post. Just know it's a fully fleshed out world with decades of lore to back it up.

It's put out by Perfect World, the same publishers of Star Trek Online. Like most free-to-play games it features a cash, or Zen, shop where you can buy things for your character, both useful and cosmetic.

&gt;So does free-to-play = pay-to-win?

No. There are items in the Zen shop which greatly impact your character (bigger bags, profession boosters, etc.) but none of them are absolutely necessary, they just help you along.

If you feel these items are necessary you're still not forced to pay. The game features an exchange allowing players to buy Zen for Astral Diamonds, an in-game currency. And so everything in the Zen Shop is available without paying, it just may take longer to get. Because of this I cannot say this game is pay to win.

###**II. Creating Your Character**

Download the game and watch the cut scene. Be sure to watch the cut scene. You'll see a little bit of the playstyle of every class and so it can help you choose what you'd like to be. Here's the class run-down:

*Guardian Fighter (Tank)* - Sword and shield wielding tank.They don't do tons of damage solo, they're made for tanking, and so this is great if you intend to level with friends. You may want to choose a higher damage class if playing solo, but you'll still be able to solo with the Guardian Fighter, you just may not feel as powerful.

*Trickster Rogue (Melee DPS)* - Standard rogue. All about DPS and being stealthy.

*Control Wizard (Ranged DPS/CC)* - Decent DPS and a lot of control, as the name suggests. Very squishy but the amount of CC they have should keep them alive.

*Devoted Cleric (Healer, Ranged Support DPS)* - This is currently the only healing class. They can DPS and solo well (this is what I play) but the important thing to know is they're currently the only real healing class, making them very sought after endgame.

*Great Weapon Fighter (Melee DPS)* - Less stealth and more big swords than the Trickster rogue.

**What race should I pick?**

Any race can be any class. Remember you'll be staring at this character all the time so I recommend picking something you like the look of. Races have racial bonuses but none are game-breaking enough to choose one race over the other.

It's asking me to fill in a background and deity?
From a gameplay perspective these don't matter. These are for us RPers who want to think of our character as more than pixels. Read up a bit, find something that sounds good to you. This doesn't effect play at all.

###**III. Playing the Game**

The opening quest lines give a good introduction to the way the game handles and so I won't go too much into every little bit of things, but here are some basics that I wish I'd known:

**The UI**

There are two modes for the UI. They're called Mouse-Look Mode, which is the mode you'll normally be playign in, and Mouse Cursor Mode, which will allow you to use the cursor and click things. You switch between them with the Alt key.

These different abilities will be introduced to you as you gain them through questing, so you'll get a basic rundown of the difference between all the spell types in-game.

###IV. The Noob's Guide to Starting Out

***I just started, what do I do?***
&gt;Play through the quests. They'll acquaint you with the basics and eventually lead you to town.

***I just reached town for the first time, what do I do?***
&gt;Continue along your quest lines to find the next areas to level. 

&gt;Visit vendors in the Market to sell any junk in your bags. 

&gt;Collect your welcome kit from the mailbox. 

&gt;Store any items you want to keep but don't need to use (like your welcome kit) in the bank.

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/Vrb0bDZ.jpg

&gt;You should now also be eligible to play Foundry quests. Foundry quests are player-created content that you can play instead of the default quest lines. Access them by pressing H, searching the Catalog, and accepting a Foundry quest.

***I just hit level 10-11, what do I do?***
&gt;It's time to start Invocations and Professions.

&gt;**Professions start at 10:** See section V below.

&gt;**Invocation starts at 11:** Once an hour you can Invoke at a Campfire. Stand at the Campfire and press Ctrl+I. You will get a temporary buff and possibly currency, items, and experience. Doing this once a day will also grant one each of Ardent and Celstial coins. You want to do this at least once a day to keep collecting these coins, which can later be traded for gear, mounts, and companions. 
 


***I just hit level 16, what do I do?***
&gt;You will have a quest to gain a Companion. Companions will help you in battle so you want to do this quest as soon as you can.  You can choose Man at Arms, Cleric Disciple, Wayward Wizard, or Dog. 

&gt;Non-tank classes will probably want to choose Man at Arms as it functions as a pocket-Tank for you. Warrior classes will like the Cleric Disciple to be their pocket healer. The Wizard deals good AoE damage and the Dog deals good single-target damage.

***I just hit level 20, what do I do?***
&gt;This is when you unlock your first mount. It may be too expensive now (5g) but you will be granted 3 free tokens to get temporary five hour mounts to help you in farming up the rest of the gold you need. You get these tokens in your blue Level Up Box. Alternatively you can sell items on the auction house for Astral Diamonds and use those diamonds to buy a mount from another player via the Auction House.

###V. Professions
Every character has access to every profession. Unlike WoW you will not choose just a few out of a list. However you do have a choice of what you focus on.

&gt;Leadership: Grants experience, money and other currency, and items.

&gt;Mailsmithing: Creates armor for Clerics and Great Weapon Fighters.

&gt;Platesmithing: Creates armor used for Guardian Fighters.

&gt;Leatherworking: Creates armor for Trickster Rogues.

&gt;Tailoring: Creates armor for Control Mages.

I chose Leadership because the experience it grants will help when leveling my character. You may wish to choose whatever crafts items for your class. Eventually you can have everything, though, so don't worry about choosing ""wrong.""

Every class has a gathering ""skill"" associated. This means they can use the nodes without kits. So as a Cleric I can gather any Religion node without needing any supplies. Anyone can gather any node but for non-class nodes you need the right kit. All of my expenditures so far have been kits to gather nodes, which is why I had a bag full of profession items. I highly recommend having ~5-10 of every type of kit (other than your class kit, which you won't need) when you're out adventuring, so no nodes go to waste.

You open your Professions tab by pressing N. Every player can use/max every profession, it just comes down to how you want to go about doing it. In your profession screen you have available profession slots. You begin with one slot and can unlock more by completing certain tasks.

http://i.imgur.com/Y5XdAwO.png

Your first move when getting started with Professions will be to hire an Asset. Think of these as workers or specialists for that profession. This is a fast task, and will be done soon. Once you have your asset you can send that asset for his first job.

http://i.imgur.com/ZMR8Xru.png

When you click on the profession, in this example Leadership, you will see a list of jobs you can do. Choose one that fits your playtime. Ideally you want to be able to be there when the job is finished, so if you know you're going to be playing for a few hours you may want to do a 2 hour task, but if you're going to sleep maybe choose a 6+ hour task.

Doing a task will reward Profession Experience and possibly other rewards. As you gain more profession experience that profession will level and you'll have access to a wider variety of jobs.

As you unlock more Profession Slots you can have multiple professions working on jobs at once or you can focus all of your slots on one profession, as long as you have the assets. (You hire additional assets after reaching certain levels in the Profession.)",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1368491763.0,,cleric,True,t3_1e42r7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e42r7/i_just_started_playing_and_my_friends_have_joined/,

Edit: They used GMT when BST was correct timezone to use. Corrected to the post.

Edit 2: From theirs Twitter, probably good news for us Europeans:

&gt;We don't plan for this to be the standard maintenance time. This is only to apply high-priority fixes ASAP.

Edit 3: I will quote theirs Twitter here about opening new servers during this maintenance because people will most likely ask without reading comments of thread.

I just wanted to post here on my thoughts so everyone could get an idea of what I'm going through and my experiences with the game.

* 1st, the CC the control wizard has is amazing.  I would like some sort of AOE stun, but that's not that big of deal.  As a control wizard, it lives up to it's name.  I control fights whenever they happen, I only get into trouble when I have 10+ guys on me.  I also have stunlock capabilities, and CCs overlap with each other with ease, making any unlucky recipient unable to react to what you are doing for a good ten seconds at least.  I'm saying, if they were spam mashing a cooldown to catch me while coming out of CC, they still wouldn't be able to do anything.  The CCs overlap, you come out of a hold while being stunned, you get what I'm saying?

* Combat gets crazy fun after 30.  In the beginning, combat is a lot of fun too, it's new, it feels good, you like it, first impressions and all.  But when you get into dungeons or some of these foundry missions, sometimes it's very hard to keep track of what's going on, and you feel way more in control of those situations.  In wow, if you get mobbed by a horde of enemies, you might just say, well I'm fucked.  Cya.  With this game, you can WIN those situations with proper gameplay.  The skill ceiling is HIIIIIGH in this game, due to the dodges and the action oriented control system.

* The dungeons are fun.  I'm not spoiling anything about them.  There are cool basic mechanics to them, it'd be fun to see what the epic versions do.

* You don't need money to excel at the game.  Meaning you don't need cash money, real dollar bills y'all.  The game is designed around F2P and I only have about 30 hours on my character.  So leveling is quick, and everything that makes the gameplay great is free.

* Start professons early, it's time based progression, like skilling up in EVE.  So have fun with that...

* Get all three types of companions, Cleric, Striker, Tank

* The zones are beautiful, and the difficulty gradually ramps up, right now I have to focus pretty hard to clear stuff.  DPS is lacking compared to rogues, but I die a lot less than my friends.  However, my rogue friend who started on Saturday is already 40.  Rogues can solo high high level content and level very quickly.

* The community is awesome.  I haven't ran into a dick yet, everyone is happy and everyone helps another.  If you are fighting at a node, everyone waits til you are finished before they take the node themselves, stuff like that.

* In groups, if loot drops, IF IT'S RED, GREED, IF IT'S GREY, NEED.

* Quest Turn ins give exp to companions.  Companions can wear equipment.

* In your character screen, hover over every stat for a detailed explanation

* Purchased items from the zen store can be sold on the AH

* The answer to the riddle in the clock tower is Twelve

* I've only been beaten in damage once, so control wizards can push the damage, and can keep up well with a well played rogue, but rogues are the kings of damage.

* Contrary to popular belief, there IS a personal bank.  Open your map and look at the legend on the right. 

* Foundry missions can be a good way of leveling.  On the minimap, there are events.  Pay attention to those!  You get leveling boosts if you take advantage of those events.



Thats it for right now I guess.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_1dcs6c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dcs6c/thoughts_from_a_level_47_control_wizard/,
1368433764.0,55,self.Neverwinter,1e8ghf,Guardian Fighter Threat Generation Guide,PostingUnderDuress,68,13,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e8ghf/guardian_fighter_threat_generation_guide/,"So, there have been multiple threads complaining that Guardian Fighter tanking is bugged, and a large amount of people complaining that GFs generate no threat and Clerics generate too much and are also bugged.

This was the case in Beta Weekend 3 but has since been fixed. If you want to see Clerics in a truly broken state, look up some footage from back then.

Anyway, I was astonished to see the majority of replies to these threads just agreeing that the situation is broken, and none actually offering advise to the tanks that are having trouble, so I thought I'd write a basic guide, as I think the people who think the situation is broken are missing the fundamentals of tanking in Neverwinter.

In my opinion, Guardian Fighter threat is in a good place right now, and doesn't need much altering. It's challenging without being frustrating, which is more than I can say for the situation in BW3. The only problem that Guardian Fighters have now is the Cleric shields being so powerful that they're rendering tanks superfluous. But this is easy to fix.

I've been 60 for about a week and a half, and have tanked a few of the epic dungeons in an organised group. This is what I've learned so far about tanking in Neverwinter. I welcome any additions by other tanks who want to chip in.

First of all, the threat generation in this game is based on a dynamic model, not a static one. What I mean by this is that, in for example, WoW, which uses a static model, you can build threat and it will never decay (outside of being victim to ""buffet"" abilities), and so if you build a large enough lead, you can literally stop, and as long as the DPS never catch up, you will never lose aggro. In Neverwinter, your threat seems to be based more on your threat per second, so as long as you're generating more threat on a mob per second at any one moment than your DPS or healers, you will hold aggro. However, if you walk away, you will quickly lose aggro as your threat per second will be zero. There seems to be a slight amount of static threat as this seems to take a short time and doesn't appear to be a completely instant aggro loss, but it is significantly faster than fully statically modeled games.

Your single, most effective skill for generating threat is Aggravating Strike. This is the skill you get as an At-Will while your guard is up, that is, the little lungey poke thing you do over the shield. This is the bread and butter ability for holding threat on a single target. However, if you can arrange more than one mob to be in front of you, you can hold threat on all of them, as the ability appears to hit anyone in a narrow cone in front of you. I've been able to hold fairly solid threat on around 5 mobs using this. Your main problem with doing this is your guard breaking from all the damage, rather than the ability itself.

Generally, your main threat generation will be a combination of spamming Aggravating Strike and recharging your guard with Tide of Iron.

Make sure you take Enhanced Mark, as a passive. This will greatly increase your threat on marked targets.

Max out the Potent Challenge feat.

Take Threatening Rush as your first At-Will (and Tide of Iron as the other). It will mark targets like there's no tomorrow. Generally, initiate aggro with that, then hold it with Aggravating Strike, and shift yourself so mobs are positioned where AS can hit more than one.

Taking Iron Warrior will help with keeping your guard meter full. Pop it when you're about to take a hard hit through your guard. Remember, because of Aggravating Strike, your threat depends on you having a guard meter, as you can't use AS without it.

By far, the difficulty with tanking is staying alive, not threat generation, although these are linked via your guard meter. Because of this, as tanks, we'll never be able to tank everything at once, but that's why we have control wizards. Some responsibility for add control falls to your DPS and control classes. GFs are not a magic bullet for all mob control, but we can do a lot of it.

Anyway, I hope this helps. Tanking's a little bit different to the model of many other MMOs, but it can be a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,guard,True,t3_1e8ghf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e8ghf/guardian_fighter_threat_generation_guide/,

I don’t proclaim my mission to be the best, as it was mainly a proof of concept.  Although it’s not the best, it was a labor of love and there was effort in it.  I can take criticism, and critiques (in fact I welcome it so I can better myself) but what pains me is the ignorance displayed on my reviews, and on some of my friend’s missions.  Thus, I give you…

**An Open Letter from us Foundry authors**

1.	*“The quest line went through a wall”* We as foundry authors cannot control the breadcrumb trail.  Maybe it goes through a wall, maybe it leads you up a hill you can’t climb, but the harsh reality is we don’t set this, nor can we edit it.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen mine or someone else’s missing given 2-3 stars because of this reason.  Really player? you were too lazy to look at a map and felt the need to give 1 star because you couldn't figure out to walk AROUND the house I placed?
2.	*“Too many FX! It’s causing my computer to lag!”* Us authors playtest our content over, and over again but we welcome bugs reports.  What isn't a bug is your computer not being able to handle the FX we have in a map, so stop complaining there is “lag” due to objects, encounters or FX because you’re running our map on a $200 Compaq laptop.  There is a slider in the options menu, use it!
3.	*“You put a “,” when it should have been a “.” and misspelled nub ya n00b“* If there is a spelling mistake or grammar mistake that should be pointed out.  What shouldn't come from a few errors is a degradation in the rating (unless it’s glaring and persistent and really taking you out of the content).  The rating system is there to filter not fun/ bad content.  Please ask yourself before rating  “Does a punctuation mark in the wrong place, or one typo really hinder your level of fun?”
4.	*“Your map should have a vendor so I can sell white items”* There is a limit to what can be entered into foundry missions.  We cannot put in PvP, Vendors or other quality of life things you might be used to in a Cryptic made map.  Does it suck? yes.  But there is always stuff to look forward to in content updates.
5.	*“The rewards and drops sucked”* The only way foundry authors control this is based on the average play time.  If the mission is longer than 15 minutes than the “standard reward” is something that can be attained at the end.  The drops that happen off mobs is totally out of our control and we cannot set the loot table or quality level.
6.	*“The prince shouldn't have been the bad guy, the story would have been better if you…(GIVES 1 STAR)”* #Dealwithit  Make your own content so I can log in and give you 1 STAR and bitch about the breadcrumb line and the FX lagging.


In closing, Review the Mission content based on fun, risk, and reward.  Please don't stop post critiques and bugs but do so in a constructive manner so we can fix it and learn.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_1dhisu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dhisu/an_open_letter_from_an_alpha_foundry_author/,

You will need to download [GlovePIE](http://glovepie.org/glovepie.php) and run the application. (there is no install, so I suggest extracting the contents and making a shortcut on the desktop) This is a great free and open source alternative to the keymapping apps you are probably used to, and the programing language gives us control over more parameters.


Here is the script I made that works quite well for me(you may find that you want to make changes to the keybinds, but that is a pretty simple process of replacing the keyboard.**x**  entries with the **x** being the key you wish to change it too.





&gt;Start of script



    //Set right stick inversion preference (0 = Normal, 1 = Inverted)
    var.Inverted = 0

    //Set dead zones  (Values between 0 and 1)
    var.LdeadX = 0.25
    var.LdeadY = 0.25
    var.RdeadX = 0.25
    var.RdeadY = 0.25

    //Left Stick – Movement

    keyboard.W = XInput1.Joy1Y &gt; var.LdeadY
    keyboard.S = XInput1.Joy1Y &lt; -var.LdeadY
    keyboard.A = XInput1.Joy1X &lt; -var.LdeadX
    keyboard.D = XInput1.Joy1X &gt; var.LdeadX

    // Right Stick – Mouse Pointer
    // To change the lookspeed, increase or decrease the number preceding the deadzone - default is 20
    if Xinput1.Joy2X &lt; -var.RdeadX or Xinput1.Joy2X &gt; var.RdeadX then Mouse.DirectInputX =      Mouse.DirectInputX + 20*deadzone(XInput1.Joy2X)
    if var.Inverted = 1 then{
    if Xinput1.Joy2Y &lt; -var.RdeadY or Xinput1.Joy2Y &gt; var.RdeadY then Mouse.DirectInputY = Mouse.DirectInputY + 20*deadzone(XInput1.Joy2Y)
    }else{
    if Xinput1.Joy2Y &lt; -var.RdeadY or Xinput1.Joy2Y &gt; var.RdeadY then Mouse.DirectInputY = Mouse.DirectInputY - 20*deadzone(XInput1.Joy2Y)
    }

    // 360 Bumpers
    keyboard.1 = XInput1.LeftShoulder
    keyboard.2 = XInput1.RightShoulder

    //360 Triggers
    mouse.LeftButton = XInput1.LeftTrigger
    mouse.RightButton = XInput1.RightTrigger

    //360 Buttons ABXY
    keyboard.space = XInput1.A
    keyboard.q = XInput1.X
    keyboard.e = XInput1.Y
    keyboard.r = XInput1.B

    //360 dPad
    keyboard.6 = Xinput1.Up
    keyboard.5 = Xinput1.Right
    keyboard.4 = Xinput1.Down
    keyboard.3 = Xinput1.Left

    //360 Start and Select
    keyboard.f = XInput1.start
    keyboard.esc = XInput1.back

    //360 Stick Clicks
    keyboard.shift = XInput1.LeftThumb
    keyboard.Tab = XInput1.RightThumb


&gt;End of script




Default key maps as follows:

    Lstick     - WASD (move)
    Rstick     - Mouse X + Y (look)
    Dpad       - 3,4,5,6 (Potions and mount)
    A          - space (jump)
    B          - R (third encounter power)
    X          - Q (first encounter power)
    Y          - E (second encounter power)
    Ltrigger   - Mouse Left click (primary at-will power)
    Rtrigger   - Mouse Right click (secondary at-will power)
    Lbumper    - 1 (first daily power)
    Rbumper    - 2 (second daily power)
    Lclick     - Shift (class mobility ability - run, dodge, shield, etc)
    Rclick     - Tab (class activated ability - Unstoppable, Mark, etc)
    Back       - esc (clear menus, exit dialogue)
    Start      - F (interact, autoloot)
    

**NOTE:** To add controller key combinations that execute a single keyboard keystroke use the following code


    //Custom Multi-Button Combinations
    keyboard.tab = Xinput1.LeftShoulder and Xinput1.RightShoulder


You can add as many lines in here as you wish, just follow the structure given. This is not included in my code as I don't use any key combos, but many people will want to.

Just a quick meta post about /r/Neverwinter. As we are rapidly approaching 5000 subscribers (sorry, *Dragon Slayers*) this may be an interesting moment to put a couple of things into perspective:

* On the first 4 days of May we've already had more Unique Visitors and Pageview on the Subreddit than we had in **all of April**.
* This is even more impressive considering that April was already a record month. It had more Uniques and Pageviews **than ALL previous months combined**.
* We were at less than 2000 Dragon Slayers only a couple of weeks ago.

It's save to say then that Neverwinter is very hot right now and we are happy to see that so many of you have recently found this Subreddit!

But all of that is just numbers. What really matters is that with this sudden rise in attention the Subreddit hasn't lost its 'ways'. The community here is friendly and helpful and the active mods (Pretty much just [Lawlta](http://www.reddit.com/user/Lawlta) and [SkumbagAce](http://www.reddit.com/user/SkumbagAce) at the moment) are doing an amazing job! They're constantly fishing the good posts from the spam filter and they have set up the flairs etc.

If you double-click your identify scrolls stack it will change your cursor and you just need to left-click once on any unidentified items to identify them.

1. **THE FRAKKIN' 3 SECOND RULE** (caps intended) - Why do you as a squishy rogue (or other squishy) charge that big pack before the tank? Stop it!. Just stop it. Smaller packs I couldn't care less but with 3+ ""medium"" mobs it can become a mess. Have you seen what happens when you charge in, hit a mob, get hit and healed for a bit? Every mob charges the healer and your friendly tank have to try and catch them all. So please for the love of Moradin give the tank a few seconds to charge in, position the mobs and build some initial aggro. 

2. **STOP THE KNOCKBACKS** - Seriously nothing is more infuriating than having the mobs nicely gathered and ready to blow a big AoE taunt just to see every mob being blown away in every direction. Well, now it's time for the tank to try and catch them all. So please stop it. But I know, knockbacks are a great way to get mobs off you. But guess what? If the tank cannot build aggro on the mobs (or taunt them) they will come back back to you. 

3. **NEXT MAN-AT-ARMS I SEE I WILL KILL** - Get another companion. You may think an extra meatshield may be useful but really it isn't. What he does is taunting mobs away from the tank so once again the tank have to play catch them all. And having a harder time to build aggro. Now guess the rest. Also these companions turn big mobs so they toss their big AoEs in the direction of you. Or make them cleave you. Do you want to be cleaved? 

4. **When you get aggro, run to the tank** - Just a friendly reminder, run to the tank. It just makes it easier to peel the mob off you. And I want to be honest, if I have mobs on me I am reluctant to charge through the whole group to peel one off you. Not only do I risk loosing more mobs than I gain but they will do collateral damage while going through the group. So go to the tank.

I feel it looks quite a bit more colorful without it, and the blur with post processing enabled really bugs me.

I thought I'd do some comparison screenshots, so others could see the differences, and make their own decision on which they prefer. The first picture of each set is with post processing enabled, and the second is without it. The graphics are on the highest settings.

Such as...
 
* When choosing you character's 'home city' in char creation, you get a title under your name of that place (eg, mine is 'X of Myth Drannor').
 
* When choosing your Religion, bare in mind that it directly affects a buff you can get every hour for praying to your chosen god. Keeping with the elfy theme I chose an [elf-god](http://neverwinter.wikia.com/wiki/Silvanus) (despite being a Human Guardian Fighter) and my buff is for Critical Strike and Dexterity. Not terrible but the ['Warrior god'](http://neverwinter.wikia.com/wiki/Tempus) one is presumably STR and would have been better. Don't know what the others do.[**EDIT: This is definitely wrong, will leave up for educational purposes**]
 
* Choose your Companion carefully (available from about lvl 16 onwards) as after the first fre one they're quite expensive. From what I've read the Cleric Disciple is best for most classes when soloing.
 
* Don't worry too much about where to sink Feats and Power points. I had about 5 of each saved up at one point while still deliberating how to spend them, only to realise I had to invest in most Powers anyway to unlock the later ones (flawed system atm imo). -- A few wasted points is inevitable, hopefully there'll be some free respec credits given out as the Beta goes on.
 
* If you want to ever level up Professions much, invest (once you've got a bit of gold in the bank) in Nature/ Theivery/ Arcane Kits, etc. I run around with 3-4 of each and have craploads of profession mats stored already, despite only starting to do this about level 15.
 

That's it so far. As I said I've only played up to 18 so have barely scraped the surface. It's a fun game but a lot needs to change during the Beta -- but that's the whole point right?
 
Anyone have any insights from higher levels? Tips about certain classes/ builds? Would love to get some proper spec theorycrafting going on here!
 
* **EDIT**: Another I just remembered: you should sit next to Campfires for about 10 seconds whenever you pass one.

Heck one of the things that cost the most money is enchants and if you save yours while leveling you should actually be able to sell them for an easy 150k as soon as you hit max level. A couple pvp items, a couple t1 items and you are basically ready for t2's!

All content in this game is 5 man content! Now on the surface this is something to complain about, no big 10/25 man raids to do, but as my guild has lost members we have come to realize something. The core of players that have actually stayed are still more than enough people to continue to keep doing content. Unlike in WoW (for example) where basically all you have to do is clear your raid for the week (which requires 25 people) you can grab 4 other people at any time and jump into Castle never for a quick 35/40 minute run. Granted...it is starting to get a bit boring after 100+ clears but you can't expect too much with a new game.

So to all you new players, this game can actually be a lot of fun. Leveling to max is actually an easy process that takes VERY little time compared to most other MMO's (I average about 22 hours to max level per toon). Getting an initial set of gear is relatively easy, and just like basically any other game doing dungeons reliably requires finding a guild. Sure there are plenty of little tricks and quirks to doing fights, but I never think of them as exploits.....some of them are easy and some of them are harder, but that is part of the charm. 

EDIT: Because a lot of people are saying they have joined guilds but still can't get into groups here are a few tips. 

* normally groups for Dungeon delves are formed up to an hour before delves. Groups will then Pre-clear the dungeon and then relog before the first boss. This allows multiple clears, if you wait till delves to look for a group you are probably an hour late

* MAKE FRIENDS! Jump on the guilds Voip server and start talking to people. Someone doing some pvp? Ask to join them. Someone leveling an alt around the same level as one of yours? Ask to join them. Most people play MMO's because they want interaction with people, reach out!

* On the topic of making friends, people tend to remember  when it comes time to make those groups for delves. That guy you just helped level his alt from 30-50...turns out he plays a GF main, and he would love to bring you to spellplague with his BFF cleric. Networking works IRL and in MMO's


So after Multiple PM's from people who have tried looking for guilds on the forums/zone chat I guess I can extend an invite to some of you. 

**Xtreme on Mindflayer** 

Will accept applications VIA PM (to myself) here. We are currently only interested in level 60 players

Please include your in game and past game (any other mmo's) experience in your message along with your main characters gear information/spec. 

Teamspeak3 use is required (along with a mic)

We are happy to teach, however you need to show a desire to learn an ability to take criticism.

1371780080.0,42,self.Neverwinter,1groje,A DC’s guide to dungeon party positioning and CW survival:,Katsudonna,50,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1groje/a_dcs_guide_to_dungeon_party_positioning_and_cw/,"So since the balance patch cleric aggro is mostly redistributed to other party members.  For CWs, their AOEs often mean they take the brunt of the aggro when stuff is left alive.  In many of the more difficult boss (and even elite) fights in T2 dungeons I’ve seen a pattern of CWs dying first leading to the inevitable party wipe or painful 3-4 manning the boss.  I don’t main a CW, I main a DC, so I can’t tell you what skills to use or builds or stats, but as any half decent Cleric pre patch will know, we’ve been tanking and kiting all the adds in dungeons for well over a month, so here’s a tip or two on survivability.  None of these are set in stone, they are guidelines only and may vary depending on enemy/party composition and competence.  Feel free to add you own tips below!

**Group positioning strategies:**

**The common, but unfavourable scenario:**
What I often see in dungeons is this- GFs/GWFs will engage the enemy.  The CW/DC may start attacking their targets prematurely, which causes those mobs to rush straight to the backlines.  The GFs and GWFs will the either have to come back with a whole bunch of adds they pulled, or fight and hold their ground.  As adds close in the CW will dodge further and further back and away from party trying to solo mobs.   The TR may get tunnel vision and focuses exclusive on one target (sometimes they should, such as on spawning pits in Spellplague and many boss fights).  As a result there are 3 battle fronts between the TR, the GF/GWF and the CW.  The DC has to make a painful moral decision on who to support/save, enemy aggro and red AOE is everywhere  and it just leads to everyone being scattered, finger pointing (often at the cleric), everyone taking more unnecessary damage and being overall less effective.

**The Ideal case:**
What you want for boss/dungeon fights is to have a solid frontline and a backline.  The party is hopefully positioned in advantageous terrain (eg on a bridge if tossing, away from bridge if fighting elites etc and not exposed to other mobs for aggro).  The GF/GWF will usually be on the elites/biggest mobs and a cluster of trash mobs.  TR will usually be on combat advantage with someone else or DPSing down glass cannon targets or helping DC/CW with aggro.  Everyone dodges red and use pots if you take a big hit.  If anyone goes down the DC or TR should try to revive as GF and GWF often bring too many mobs with them.  The DC will be somewhere in the middle casting AS with the GF on one edge and the rest of it towards the CW.  The CW is ideally just a little behind the DC to stay in healing range and using GF/GWF as meatshields between mobs and you.  This is a good setup, as tanks can hold the front, CWs can cluster everything there to be mowed down with AOE or control them while priority targets are dealt with. There is **focused fire** so stuff dies fast and early, and the DC can support everyone with AS/ healing.  There should be just one frontline.  If adds break for DC/CW everyone else is close enough to the frontline to be dealt with.

**Let GF/GWF grab aggro before engaging:**
Always let the GF/GWF engage first with taunt etc to grab aggro.  They will then either proceed to tank at the mobs or drag them back at the party.  Once they have held their ground, the DC will know where to cast AS and that will be the right time to start engaging and casting, not before, otherwise the mobs will rush straight at you in the backline and create two fighting fronts.  The tanks will have to either tank the mobs and leave you on your own or try to peel off you and expose the rest of the party.  Not a pretty scenario in either case.

**When adds pile up- CW survival guide:**

If you have the inevitable add train on you, ideally the GF and GWF can come in and regain aggro off you, but if they have priorities elsewhere or forgot about you here’s how to survive:

+ **Don’t stand in red** circles at all, even to get a cast off unless you’re 120% certain you’ll be fine.  There is no more excuse for laziness with no AS stacking and only 66% uptime.  Often it’s not just the damage, but the stun/ toss back from one red circle to the next that will get you down.

+ **Use potions to counter spike damage**.  Post patch your aggro is like nothing it used to be.  If you don’t heal yourself up between fights via potions/astral shield you’re going to be a liability.

+ **Dodge TOWARDS the cleric** or center of party instead of further back.  A good cleric will have his eyes on you and is ready to heal/clutch, but if you vanish or go too far they cannot support you. So often I have divine armor on cast as a clutch heal only for the CW to have dodged too far from the AOE.  If clerics have to make a choice between backing the frontline and saving the CW they will often be more committed to the tanks, as that’s where the danger and bulk of the party is.  Dodge towards the DC, they can handle a few more hits due to higher defense and they’ve dealt with adds from all their training.  

+ **Stay within astral shield**.  See that shiny blue circle on the ground that the cleric tries so hard to keep up?  That shield gives you a massive damage reduction and healing over time.  If necessary, kite by running laps on the edge of the shield.  Remember DCs during the last 25% of spellplague boss?  Or doing the Indy500 in FH?  That’s you now (if you’re unfortunate).  This is what DCs have done all this time and it keeps us alive and mobs behind.  

+ **Don’t cast unless you can dodge**.  If stuff is in your face or right on your heels, do not stop and cast unless you have clearance to get a spell off and stamina to dodge RIGHT after.  Wait for stamina to regen before casting.  With 3 dodges per full stamina bar (vs 2 for DCs), you should be able to dodge to gain a lead, cast, dodge out of red circles and keep running.

+ **Use GF/GWF and even DC as meatshields** between you and new adds.  When adds spawn (looking at you Spider temple blademasters) they often just charge the closest member or the DC with healing aggro.  You want to position yourself physically such that the GF/GWF are closer to them when they spawn/charge.  They can take the hit, you can’t.  They’d much rather take the damage and heal than to break off, revive you and turn the fight into a nightmare.

Hopefully that helps everyone have a better time in dungeons and boss fights.  Feel free to post your class tips also!

However the token respecs everything this includes:

Ability score (Things like Dex/Str/Con etc.)

Powers

Feats

So 1 respec token will basically set you back to default, hope this clears things up for people, happy farming :)


Edit: Just for people saying it's a sham spending $6 for a respec, I'll just try and put it into perspective that nothing in this game cost real money.

You can earn EVERYTHING for free by simply farming, they presented you with a free game, respecs cost Zen which is basically just AD. But if you go out and farm (FOR FREE HOLY SHIT) AD which yea it may cost 400,000 but my word all you had to do for what was invest TIME. You have a respec. 

The difference is if you put money into the game (real money) you basically just speed time up that's all, there is no forcing you to buy zen. Farm 300,000-400,000 AD convert it to 600 Zen and oh look a respec. You can get away with selling low level blues for close to 100,000 you can make 24,000 a day from dailies/events (spam skirmish event 1000 AD every time you complete it within the hour). 

Hopefully as time goes on most of the people who can't see past there blind rage of a tooltip leave the game and things settle down, I'm no fanboi of this game but show me wildstar and I'll defend it until my fingers bleed :D",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1367713823.0,,,True,t3_1dom7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dom7l/psa_respec_token_resets_everything/,

What skills I use in an instance:

At Wills - Sure Strike, Weapon Master Strike


Encounters - Daring shout, Indomitable Battle Strike, Flourish


Class Feature - Steel Blitz, Weapon Master


Daily - Crescendo, Slam

Rotation: Daring Shout -&gt; Weapon Master -&gt; Imdomitable Battle Strike -&gt; Flourish -&gt; Weapon Master -&gt; Either more weapon masters or sure strike depending on situation

My general idea for getting damage done is always keep weapon master debuff on targets, it lasts for 3 seconds so you can generally do two encounters before u reset it or 2 full sure strike rotations. Ideally in this spec if you can pop your Unstoppable to increase your encounter damage by 10% more when you doing the combo. When I was able to achieve all these debuffs lined up I was able to get a 34k Indomitable Battle strike crit.

I have made some modifications to the spreadsheet over all.

* Removed columns (Money,  Xp,  AD) from Platesmithing, Mailsmithing, Leatherworking, Tailoring. Those skills don't provide that resource

* Removed columns (CPM,  XPM,  ADPM) from Platesmithing, Mailsmithing, Leatherworking, Tailoring. If it can't reward it then it can't reward it per minute right?

* Changed the name of PXP and PXPM to LXP and LXPM to avoid some confusion. The columns are listed in the order that the game lists the rewards.

* Completed all Common tasks for Platesmithing. (A few items need exact requirements still)

* Transfered new data from the Version 1 Spreadsheet.

* Locked version 1 from editing. (Viewing is still available so any data I missed can be reproduced on V2)

Link to previous reddit post for reference: http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dmm37/neverwinter_crafting_spreadsheet/

Edit:  Kind of depressing that people would vandalize the spreadsheet like that. But anyway it lookks to have been restored and is not set to view only for most people.  If you would like to make a contribution you can request share and I will share the doc with you. THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.

I say this because it makes me have zero drive to do dungeons while it isn't up and makes me stressed when it is.

My suggestion is to remove it completely and instead change it to a 1/day or 2/day bonus chest that you get for running the dungeon regardless of what time it happens to be. 

This would encourage people to run dungeons more often as they would have a reason to run multiple a day instead of farming one during the DD timer.  They would want to get in their daily runs of each dungeon.

WTF is going on in Neverwinter.. 

- How are people monitoring threat? Is there an indicator that I am not seeing? 

- How are people keeping threat? I am level 30 and I can't pull a mob off of my level 1 Cleric.. and I am spamming everything I have.. 

- What abilities as a GF generate the most threat?

- Can anyone who is successfully tanking please link their build? 

In closing.. the only other thing I can think of .. is that Guildwars 2 ruined the trinity.. so now we have to wait for people to re learn how threat mechanics work.. 

Also .. Control wizards.. DO NOT just spam that stupid blow mobs across the map spell.. it Fucks your tank up .. use your brain and use it logically .. but if you spam it 2 seconds after your tank charges in.. it's useless. and you're making yourselves look stupid.

Hello everyone, I have created a [Crafting Tutoral for Neverwinter on YouTube](http://youtu.be/ZrXNv0MWzHo).  I wanted to put this up here for anyone that might be interested in crafting.

I have made video tutorials for a few games now and wanted to get one started for Neverwinter.  It's designed to answer the questions people have regarding how to start, how it works, and to give some tips on maximizing their crafting over time.

It's a work in progress and only part 1 is available due to the time restricted nature of the crafting system.  Below I have posted the link to the YouTube video itself as well as the contents of the video description if you wish to explore a particular subject.

If you found it informative or feel it could be improved in any way, please leave some feedback and let me know.  I'll be watching this posted thread as well as the comments on the YouTube video.

Thank you for your time.

1) Raids or at least better boss mechanics.  It feels like every boss does the same thing: don't stand in red and have OT pick up adds when they spawn.  While at first this is fun, it gets old too quick.

2) More classes.  Luckily here is something they will do so I'm not worried.

3) Balance. If you've played a GWF you know this needs to be done and soon.

4)Lower cost of needed items in zen market or subscription option.  6 dollars to respec is too much. Nuff said.  Also, if you don't know about the rune/ward system check out this post and read number 7... this alone may keep me from playing long term if they don't change it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dry0g/neverwinters_f2p_model_what_you_need_to_know/

5) Ranked PvP. Lets face it you all wanted to be 2200+ and go play WoW with 2 buddies in sanfransisco or something for like 200,000 dollars and be known as the best Orc Warlock of all time.  NW needs this, PvP just as a fun thing is good, but as a competition with points is better.

* The displacement from Bait and Switch and Blitz can be avoided by jumping before using the skill.

* You can move up a step or two between Duelist Flurry's two wind up hits so instead of watching mobs walk ever-so-slightly away, you can advance toward them during the twirl-twirl portion so they eat the entirety of the stabstabstabstabstabstabbleedbleedbleed part we all enjoy.

* Be careful when starting Duelist Flurry on mobs near cliffs.  The stabstabstabstabbleebleed portion of the skill follows mob displacement so every now and again you may find yourself sucked into a CW's Space Toilet or pushed off with the mobs as well.

* Jumping forward, or any direction really, and then using a skill keeps you moving while it goes off.  This was especially helpful for me in pvp when leading Dazing Strike on moving targets.

Last nail to the coffin was when I found out about the Cat Companion, which is definitely the best companion to have in the game. You can either drop real money on it and get it within 5 minutes, or you can farm Astral Diamonds for +30 days to get it. 

Not to mention that respeccing costs $6 worth of ZEN and all that crap with the best enchants &amp; runes. 

One could argue that you can get all that  with just a little bit farming but if you want to get the cat companion for example, you have to focus all your AD profits to it for more than a month. 

This game holds huge potential but is ruined by giving an option to make your character more effective with real money. If there was a monthly fee and gold as its only currency, this really could be something. But at the end of the day, only players this game will have are the ones who are willing to spend real money in it.


About Cleric's life at 60. PVP is a ton of fun but CTs and TRs with proper enchantments just absolutely destroy me. I had a game today where we stacked 2 Astral Shields (-40% from incoming damage) and a rogue 1 shot me from 100% to 20% hp and quickly finished me off after that. I know they most likely are gonna tone down TRs and CTs later on with patches, but I highly doubt they will nerf their runes/enchantments.

PVE is fun, but the classes are just messed up, if solo queueing to a epic dungeon. We might get a group with 1 cleric and 4 rogues or whatever. It's completely random and messed up, but most likely will also be fixed.

Only thing that could keep me into the game right now is PvE since PvP is just too horribly gear dependant and imbalanced, it's no fun unless you are a TR or CT with some RL money enchants/runes. That being said, the moment they release raids there will be a competetive aspect to the game; who clears first etc, and that'll be most likely dominated by the people who have dropped the most money into the game.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1368387683.0,,,True,t3_1e74cj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e74cj/lv60_clerics_thoughts_on_the_game/,

1369090036.0,26,self.Neverwinter,1eq4ax,Guide to augment companions and why gearscore is NOT everything.,Reyals_eht,38,12,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1eq4ax/guide_to_augment_companions_and_why_gearscore_is/,"Very simple, augment pets are a means to supplement your gear set with stats you are lacking, and reaching the optimal values for diminishing returns.

power is a supplemental rating that yields damage, but at a low ration, 5k power equates to roughly 200 damage.

critical rating levels off pretty harshly around 3400-3600

recovery levels of steeply as well, at around 3800

To begin lets compare the value of a rare (blue) to an epic(purple)

on average an epic ring, for instance, supplies between 133 and 154 to 3 ratings. and has a socket, usually offense.

rare rings acquired via pvp yield values of 243 and 133 to 2 ratings, with, again, generally an offense slot. 

let's say a t2 armor set supplies you with 1270 power and critical, 1024 recovery, 658 defense, and 785 life steal. with a rank 7 lifesteal socketed in the chest piece

add in all your accessories and weapons and you may get values comparable to:
3126 power
2411 crit
2558 recovery
707 defense
and 1403 life steal
we want to reach thresholds for diminishing returns on critical and recovery

a cat supplies both of these stats by simply ranking up

at best you can find an epic ring with 175 crit and 2 other stats, or 150 recovery and 2 other stats.

meanwhile a rare ring ""ring of the executioner"" acquired from the first boss of caverns of karrundax in normal difficulty, gives 238 crit, 72 recovery, and an offense slot that can provide an extra stats (185 for rank 7, 220 for rank 8, and ??? for rank 9) possible stats are power, crit, recovery, or armor pen


so we can get a bonus of either 399-462 + an enchantment
or very specific attributes of 310 and an enchantment.

an extra 150 points isn't going to benefit you much if you are already at the DR level for that rating, so getting a little more is a massive waste, getting more of an exceptionally useful rating is vastly more valuable in terms of character performance

**Reasons to choose a specific augment pet over another:**

currently max rank is a factor, in the future it wont be with the addition of training tomes

**offense slots VS defense slots (runestones)**
offense slots allow for the socketing of power crit recovery and armor pen.
a defense slot gives you the ability to slot an eldritch runestone, this stone provides an extra X% of its stats gained from items to you, so having a rank 8 will give you an additional 9% of all the attributes it gained from its equipment slots.

if you gear the companion with 1000 of one stat, you gain an additional 90 points to that stat with a rank 8 rune.

**accessory slots VS offhand slots**
accessories are much easier to find with specific values of specific stat pairings. it's really a judgement call


gear score is half the battle, once you reach the 9200 marker for entering castle never, its a moot value. gear with knowledge not with numbers in your eyes

I hope this helps somebody at some point in their decisions with companions.


**Useful item names:**
lethal occult items are critical/recovery, primary crit
occult ___ of respite as above with recovery primary
blessings, power and X
youth: regeneration
piercing: armor pen
berserker: crit/armor pen

executioner: several different items ranging from regeneration to a crit/recovery ring i mentioned

bleached bone belt 325 recovery and a defense slot


edit: many thanks, this is by far my most successful post since joining reddit.

Edit2: Despite being banned from the game, Kripparian offers pretty good information on deminishing returns for damage relative ratings. [DR Info](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR4KdpzlbqU)

**EDIT3:** Clerification on GEARSCORE and how it is calculated..
The gearscore calculation is extremely simple.. there is no algorithm at all.. it's the total of your attack/healing and your protection, which is listed beneath your ratings. anything that modifies ANY of those values contributes to your gearscore. feats are the only outlier

**Drei'raeth Caverns**

**NW-DRLYRON2C** 

***Deep beneath the cavernous networks of the Underdark, in the darkest depths of the of the Lowerdark regions where none dare venture. Exists a notorious order of assassins named the Drei'raeth. At the end of the age of demons, the evilest beings in all of Faerûn were driven deep into the Drei'raeth Caverns. Detained by the Drei’raeth Elders, with the help of Lolth, they use them to challenge initiates of the Drei’raeth order in hopes of weeding out the weak.  It’s been heard that the order has opened its caverns to all who dare, in hopes of hardening their training. And are offering rewards to any adventurer who is up for the challenge. To accept this challenge travel to the darkest depths of Faerûn, and slay the Demon Lord Adramalech and his cohort of minions!***

The player has to face three Chambers of Sin before facing Adramalech, Lord of Demons in the final Chamber.

* **Chamber of Lust - Cha'lice, Demon of Lust**
* **Chamber of Gluttony - Mordekai &amp; Lokash, Demons of Gluttony**
* **Chamber of Greed - Alabazz, Demon of Greed**
 
**NOTE**: Designed as a very challenging solo quest! Although possible I ***recommend 2 players in most cases***, 3 is too many.

Hello fellow Faerûnians (If that's what their called)! ***Dracarys Drei'raeth*** once again, officer of the reddit guild Karma on Dragon and a dedicated Hero of the North Founder.

 If you haven't found a guild home yet please join our channel /AllKarma and ask for an invite to our guild or our sister guild Amrak (Karma Spelled backwards) as we have hit the member cap of 500 in Karma.

So at this point I have posted three separate version of my Foundry quest “Drei’raeth Caverns”. I released v1.0, v2.0, and v2.5.  I have made leaps and strides in the development of the quest on each and every version and Have now released v3.0 as of Saturday the 11th of May.  First and foremost I would like to thank all my reviewers who have given me constructive criticism along the way, it wouldn't be what it is without you. 

**I know have over 230 reviews and well over 300 plays with a 4 star rating!**

I have now spent upwards of over 48 hours played time within the foundry alone making sure this quest is the best it can be.

For those who have completed my quest previously, I assure you it is worth your time to try it once again!  It has been completely revamped from my first, second, and third release.  It is enthralled with a much more epic, fiery, demonic, “Diabloesque” feel to it. As *Diablo* was a big inspiration for the design.

I am getting close to submitting my quest to Cryptic to be featured but still have some work to do.  I have some amazing additions in mind but my next release will be my final release before submitting it to be featured by Cryptic.  I fell it is in its last stages of its development, and I plan on creating more and perhaps making this a campaign of demon slaying awesomeness.

**But I need your help!**


**The following major updates have been made since my v.2.5 release**:

* Drei'raeth Caverns now has 100% customized monsters/demons I have designed myself along with my own mob names and descriptions. (I wanted this quest to feel very unique!)
* Increased overall difficulty of the entire dungeon
* Increased difficulty of Alabazz and Cha'lice boss encounters
* Decreased (again) difficulty of Mordekai and Lokash, The Twin Demons of Gluttony encounter and removed the aoe/knock back abilities from one of them.
* Opened up Mordekai and Lokash boss room to allow for more space when fighting the two giants.
* Added more quest objectives and side tasks by adding objects to interact with.
* Additional ""Surprise"" encounters have been added to the quest.
* Varied boss abilities.  No longer do all bosses have the same abilities.  Each boss has unique abilities.
* Significantly increased the difficulty of Adramalech, Lord of Demons final encounter.
* Added several sound overlays and special effects for boss encounters and added more appropriate music.
* Increased the level of detail and ambiance of every room throughout the Caverns to include fire, lighting, and smoke effects.
* Each section of the caverns is now ""color coded"" for each boss.  Cha'lice being purple, Mordekai and Lokash being Orange, Alabazz being Green, and Adramalech being Black and Red.  The details, fire, and special effects also mesh with this theme adding another level of detail and customization to the environment.
* Created Scripted boss encounters with dialogue and voice effects.
* Demons with Drei'raeth Caverns now speak to you while fighting, adding more diverse elements to the gameplay.
* Removed “visible” traps, and significantly reduced the amount of traps period.
* Edited Mismatched Mob names and titles and fixed skins/costumes of encounters that weren't correct.
* Added more of a variety of encounter types with different abilities instead of all encounters having skills of the ""Ashmadai""
* And much much more! 

**Some keynotes**:

* **Eligible for daily foundry quest**
* Quest has a **4 star** rating, based on over 230 reviews now (Thanks guys!)!
* This quest IS **Soloable** BUT it is not easy for everyone.  I recommend bringing a friend if you’re not confident OR bringing plenty of potions and a cleric companion if you have one.  I solo it as a GWF with a Cleric Companion at level 40 but I do consume a lot of pots and die sometimes.
* Quest can be done as soon as you enter the protector’s enclave which is the first main city you get to at around level 4-5.
* Author has no influence over loot rewards whatsoever.
* ***Falling to your death due to mob knockback is no fault of the Author.  Please be aware of your surroundings and beware of cliff edges and lava pits.***
* You can access Drei’raeth Caverns from any gate and fast travel to it.  It is not a “zone” based quest.
* A true dungeon crawl feel! Inspired by action rpgs such as *Diablo.*

**OOC**: It is a gauntlet style quest approximately **20-30 min** long depending on how skilled you are. This was originally designed as a quick, easy, simple, and fun daily foundry quest that doesn’t require a player to click through 100 quest dialogues and read a novel just to complete the quest, it has since evolved into something a bit more challenging but still does not require the player to read a short story.  Simply get to the end and survive all three chambers of sin and you are rewarded. Nice for players who just want to lay the smack down on some demons and test builds. It has dense mob packs in a linear twisting cavern experience with soundtrack that is all custom built by me. It has three minor boss fights in between the maximum amount of monster encounters for a map in dense packs which makes for great AOE encounters.  You will also face a final main boss fight at the end that has three phases,one of which he re-incarnates all of the bosses within the map. Grind quality is pretty good though not as fast as others though far less boring, due to the four boss fights you will encounter. So far the overwhelming response from players has been that they loved it! I'm still looking for more reviews to add more content and tweak any bugs players point out! Try it out, and leave me your foundry and I will try yours in return!

**DIRECTIONS**: Search for ""Drei'raeth Caverns"" in the foundry in game by pressing ""K"" then navigating to the foundry. Foundry can be done as soon as you reach the Protectors Enclave at about level 5 because it requires you to access the city gate in order to fast travel. Also this quest is not based on an over-world map which means you can access it directly by traveling using the city gate instead of actually having to go to a zone in order to enter it.

***Message me at Dracarys Drei'raeth@ashenoak for any comments or questions or email me in game with suggestions!***

CWs are amazing at keeping the mobs in the air and not beating on people, but group mates don't like it because they want to be top damage at the end of the instance (which I admit, isn't important as long as the last boss goes down.)

So far, we've got a Great Weapon Fighter, a Guardian Fighter (me), a Control Wizard and a Cleric; we've done the Gift of Tymoria, and had a ton of fun.  We've also just gotten our companions, and are going to get mounts (either with Zen or not) as soon as we ding to 20.

So far, I'm LOVING all the secrets and hidden goodies - it really helps add to the feeling that you're really playing D&amp;D. The Shield mechanic for my class is also a seriously cool touch.

We haven't gotten too far, really I think the highest level we've reached is 17 or so, so we're really pretty new to the world. 

Anything hugely important we should be aware of, or leveling tips?  

One buddy is a few levels back, so we'd like to get him current, if possible.

The system will recover, but some jerks are still going to be filthy rich, and ordinary folks will take a hit, short-term (roll back) and long-term (damaged economy). It ain't fair.

Dealing with situations like this, processing that sense of *wrongness* is a part of life. The world itself (which is much more important and serious than NWO) isn't fair, [either](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis).

What makes this rough for some people is that one of the things we want in our games (at least I do) is a world that *is* fair: within the level playing field of an MMO, time and effort are (or should be) rewarded equally, and a path to success (unlike in life) is clear, measurable, and achievable. That sense of justice within an internal system has taken a hit in NWO. 

The thing that keeps occurring to me, here, is that the ability to react to that sort of injustice/wrongness is bigger than the game - it's *life-big*, if you know what I mean. In the face of unfairness, do you walk away, do you shake your fist, or do you make what you can control/accomplish the measure by which you judge your own success, rather than dwelling on exploiters or the imperfections of the system?

I'm not quitting: for me, it's the same game it was a couple of weeks ago. Whether anyone else quits is, of course, up to them. My thought, though, is that before you quit, you should take a step back and think about why you're doing it, and what it might (or might not) say about you.

1368366620.0,24,self.Neverwinter,1e6kz4,[PSA] Account Security and recent wave of hackings,Crackcarton,50,26,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e6kz4/psa_account_security_and_recent_wave_of_hackings/,"TLDR

Your account is extremely unsafe please take this into consideration if you have put money into this game or plan on it.


There has been a wave of account hackings today me being one of them and  I wanted to bring up some glaring issues with PWI account security to hopefully save you guys the hassle of going through it.

- Account Guard is ineffective, If a hacker has access to your login info they can then enter your account through the website and change the email on the account without you ever knowing or needing to confirm the computer they are using.

- When a email change request is made the confirmation is then sent to the NEW email address and a notification is sent to the OLD email address telling you that your email has been changed. If this happens on the weekend you are then SOL.

(Hello,

We have received a request from you to change your account's registered email address. A confirmation email has been sent to your new email address for verification.

If you did not request your email address to be changed, please contact our customer support department immediately. )

- PWI Customer support only operates M-F from 10am PST-7PM. If you are as unfortunate as me your account will get hacked on the weekend leaving you helpless until the following monday.

I was actually shocked at how easy it is to simply change the email address on an account without having the account holder provide some sort of verification. This is the first time i've had an account hacked in the 10+ years I have been playing MMO's. There are players that have reason to believe that Founders are being targeted seeing as they will have a much higher amount of AD or Zen than other users.

- From level 10, you get a profession slot, and you can very quickly get another 1 by levelling a profession to 3. Hire mercenaries everyday, they go for 10k AD on the AH at the moment - so you earn 20k AD per character slot per 18 hours.
- From level 11, you can invoke the gods. Do this every day on every character, and every week for every character you have a chance to get those coveted rare wards that otherwise need to be bought for ~10 dollars and are strictly necessary to get the best enchants. You'll also get some astral diamonds along for free every day as well.
- You get extra inventory space, which otherwise costs a ton as well.

1365996705.0,24,self.Neverwinter,1cd94c,Overview of changes from previous BW to BW4,thevaladil,24,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1cd94c/overview_of_changes_from_previous_bw_to_bw4/,"So i broke down and purchased the $60.00 pack to get access to this weekend/head start access to the game, and here is an overview of what's changed since BW3.

Crafting:

I was dissapointed in the crafting system in general, you don't actually have to do anything to craft, just click a button and a crafting asset will take care of everything for you.  It takes time, but its not time that you have to actually devote to crafting.  Also, some of the time requirements are crazy, it took 6 hours to crate a pair of leather shoes (lv 9 trickster rogue boots) - this was as a lv 2 leatherworker fyi.  Overall I think the crafting system needs work.  (I did like that you can do your crafting form the internet (https://gateway.playneverwinter.com) and thought that the website interface actually felt smoother than the in game tool for crafting.

Gateway:

The gateway program is awsome!  Being able to update your Auction House listings, and search/purchase new items right from the internet was great.  The crafting was smooth from this perspective (see above for opinion) and being able to switch characters to work on all of them at the same time is quicker than the in game features.

Power Tree:

I'm of mixed feelings about the new leveling tree.  On the one hand, I really like that they took peoples concerns into consideration and made a major change to the game.  The level system isn't bad, but if they decide to keep it this way I think it needs some work.  Some of the powers got moved from early powers in BW2/3 (bait and switch was like lv 7 or something as a rogue, can't get until lv 25+ - can't remember exact level right now).

On the other hand, I really enjoyed being able to try out all of the powers in the previous BW's.  I felt like I had MORE character customization when I could pick any power and slot it into my active power section.  As it is now, I spent points on powers I would never use, just to unlock powers that I wanted.

Level Speed:

It felt to me that they made the leveling in BW4 even faster than previous weekends.  My rogue is now lv 44, with a play time of 1 day 16 hours 43 min (41 hrs aprox).  I went from lv 34 to 44 in 10 hours this weekend, which is about what they wanted, but I wasn't actually playing that entire time, I tested out crafting and searched all of the vendors for new gear and stuff, played the Auction House as well.  I think I spent a total of 7 hours leveling up, and made 10 levels this weekend - that seems quick to me, especially at the higher levels of the game.

Identify Scrolls:

In previous BW it cost 800 AD for an identify scroll.  They now have 3 different types of scrolls (lv 1-29, lv 1-59, lv 60).  The costs are much more reasonable now (15, 45, 150 respectivily).  I sold a few items on the AH, and purchased 20 lv 1-59 ID scrolls for 900 AD.  I also found 18 during my travals while questing.  It was very reasonable to keep all of my gear that I found identified so I could sell in on the AH.

General Overview:

Overall I'm still a huge fan of Neverwinter, and I'll be playing once the game goes live at the end of the month.  I feel that the Crafting System still needs work, and the Leveling system (if they don't change back) could use a little work as well.  Otherwise, a great game that I'm looking forward to.  Also, the Gateway is awsome!",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,gwf,True,t3_1cd94c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1cd94c/overview_of_changes_from_previous_bw_to_bw4/,
1364383095.0,22,self.Neverwinter,1b3rhg,Why the Guardian Fighter tanking model probably needs work,PostingUnderDuress,25,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1b3rhg/why_the_guardian_fighter_tanking_model_probably/,"I played as a Guardian Fighter throughout the beta weekend, as far as level 30. I played in an organised group of 5 experienced raiders the entire time and completed both instances we came across, with the exception of getting Chartilifax to around 3% before we had to quit, so my experience of the beta was very much from a tanking perspective.

I've been playing MMO's since WoW European launch in 2005, and as a tank since that point, tanking all encounters as main tank from Molten Core through Naxxramas 40 in vanilla as a 6-night a week raider, along with a few encounters in each expansion (although I flirted with other classes over that time). I've also played my fair share of post-WoW MMOs, including SWToR, Guild Wars 2, and a bit of Tera.

First of all, this was my first experience of Neverwinter, and I hadn't even heard much about it at all until a couple of days before the weekend, so was naturally sceptical, as I think most veteran MMO players are of new MMOs, given the rate of failure of post-WoW efforts. However, I was very pleasantly surprised, had a blast the whole weekend, and very much enjoyed how tanking in Neverwinter felt.

However, as many have pointed out, it has its issues. I won't go into the Cleric threat thing, as it's fairly obvious that it's broken. Despite the Cleric issues, I feel the Guardian tanking model has some flaws that need ironing out before final for the tanking, and instancing in general, to be less frustrating.

The main issue seems to be that Guardian Fighters rely too heavily on tricks to maintain aggro, rather than a static threat table. In fact, there appears to be no static threat table at all, at least where GFs are concerned. As soon as you stop guard-stabbing your primary target, it runs (usually for the Cleric at this point). It seems to be impossible to build any kind of threat lead at all, meaning any time spent off target at all will lead to an aggro loss.

This leads me to believe that the threat model in Neverwinter is possibly based on a dynamic threat table, like that of Tera; that being one where threat is maintained by threat-per-second rather than static threat volume. Either this, or as I mentioned before, there simply is no threat attached to GFs at all, merely threat tricks, such as taunts and marks. Either way, these threat systems lead to several issues which will inevitably make encounter design less interesting, or otherwise frustrating to all involved. What follows are a few reasons why this way of modelling threat isn't as interesting as a static model.

- The tank must stay on the main target at all times. This means that there can't be any mechanics that involve the tank avoiding obstacles or moving too much, else the DPS will pull aggro immediately, and consequently...
- The DPS has to throttle too much. A little throttling is fine, it's part of working well as a team, but having to throttle all the time is just frustrating.

- The dynamic threat model completely breaks multi-target tanking. Because the tank must keep his TPS maxxed on one target at all times, he cannot tank more than one target unless those 2+ targets are sat on top of one another and all take all the attacks. This is incredibly limiting for encounter design. It also means Clerics, even once their threat is back in check, will be being chased unless the DPS can manage the off-targets, which consequently means that the DPS will be taking aggro themselves.

- Tank kiting can't be done. Anyone remember AQ20 from WoW? Ossirian the Unscarred was the final boss of this instance. It remains one of my favourites. The main mechanic was that the tank had to gain and maintain aggro on the boss and then kite him to various points on the map, at which point someone would detonate obelisks that would damage him. With a dynamic threat model, fights like this can't happen, as the threat on the tank is too unstable to properly kite.

I understand that Cryptic may have gone this way with the design to make tanking more challenging, which is great. Despite the frustrations, I really enjoyed the fact that tanking was challenging again. It felt like vanilla WoW, which I feel was where tanking was most enjoyable. However, I still feel that using a static threat model, but tweaking numbers so maintaining aggro remains challenging, will be better for the game and encounter design in the long run.

Let me know what you all think. I'm interested to hear some counterpoint.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,guard,True,t3_1b3rhg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1b3rhg/why_the_guardian_fighter_tanking_model_probably/,

This is our first F2P MMO, so some of this may just be ignorance or stupidity, so please be kind :)

I'm not getting the economy model. There seems to be 5 or 6 currencies, with the the two main ones being Zen and and Astral Diamonds. Zen can be purchased for $10 - 1000 Zen, I think? or you can trade AD for them on the auction house. I'm ok with that. But the prices for everything seem insanely high. For example, our characters are just shy of level 30 and we have around 10k of AD from doing daily Foundry quests. But to buy most stuff you need 100k AD or more. Are we missing some easy AD earning method?

Ardent coins seem to be a single coin per day. But the Piety Vault things has things that cost 360 coins. Are they really expecting you to save for that long to save it up? 

Similarly, the Zen cost of things is high too. Blue mounts are 2500-3500 zen. That just seems like a boatload of real money for a single item used on a single character. Maybe if I'm missing the AD boat, trading it in for zen makes this more reasonable, but right now, I'm confused. 

What is the point of professions? I can make my hirelings go out and bring me stuff, but for the most part, it's far below what I'm picking up off the ground. Does it catch up at some point and eventually give you gear you can use before you level past the need for it?

Beyond dying your gear, is there any way to make your character actually look different? It seems like every piece of armor is visually identically to each other. I could dye it, but given the turnover rate of my gear, it just feels like I'm wasting my time / money with dyes.

I've got 12 Nightmare lock boxes. The keys are for sale for 125 zen or whatever. Is it worth it to try to unlock it? or is 99.9999% crap and .00001% the nightmare horse?

The game is fun, but a lot of these things are off-putting. I don't mind putting $30 bucks a month in a game that is fun. But I look around and wonder if that is enough to really get the most out of the game. and if not, do I want to bother spending my time of the game.

1363003311.0,23,self.Neverwinter,1a2swi,Short Unbiased Review from New Player,jgortner,26,3,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1a2swi/short_unbiased_review_from_new_player/,"Redditophies,

It is without any bias or preconception that I bring you a short review from Neverwinter.  I would consider myself your typical gamer (both tabletop and video) with your average MMO experienced (raided in WoW, played GW, DDO, Tera, tried GW2, etc).

**What I absolutely loved ...**

 * Lore - A veritable forest of lore hooks, story, background, lore items in the game, and even praying to your diety every hour for buffs and items. The game provides and immerses players in the lore of the game.

 * Combat - You non-movement non-keyboard hand stays on the mouse 100% of the time to aim. But this is not Tera and does not require perfect precision or power-gamer like twitchyness. Mouseover an enemy and press or hold a mouse button to fire. Once you start firing if you keep the mouse button held down you stay locked on that target. This and other things make the combat viceral and just plain fun as you throw spells (or melee) at your target.

**What I really liked ...**

 * Game Style - This game does not feel 100% like your typical MMORPG. They have made the feel more like a D&amp;D campaign you are on. At least at this stage there is not as much open and persistent world questing (it is about 50/50 where most MMOs are 90%+ in the persistent world). I thought I would hate this but it really makes the came feel more D&amp;D like. And being 50/50 you do still have quests in the public domain you just have private quests in the sewers or otherwise that are instanced. But honestly I think this (and other things) gives the game the D&amp;D feel.

 * Character and Development - Whether you like D&amp;D or not the character sheet is just awesome. Your stats, feats, and otherwise really add a nice sense of progression to the game and connection to your very customizable character. I imagine players will be very unique in their playstyle (also becuase of powers; see next bullet ...)

 * Power set - Players pick 2 at wills, 3 encounter (short cooldown), and 2 daily powers (long cooldown). I cannot stress enough what a delight it is not to have 4 power bars flooding my screen and a preset rotation to do. Daily powers are saved for specific situations to maximize their use; encounter powers are used often but discretionary enough to have to think when / why to use them; and at wills fill the gap. No to rotations and staring at cooldowns and castbars and yes to combat awareness and staring at the cool environment and monsters instead. Oh, and the spell animations kick ASS!

 * Immersive Elements - Lots of immersive elements that really pull the game together! From running into traps during quests and dungeons, to secret passageways only certain classes can enter or chests that only rogues can unlock, to praying to your diety every hour for buffs and items.  This game does not dissapoint! If you are a super-fast-paced grind-grind-grind get-to-max kind of player you won't enjoy this. For others seeking a fun, character driven, immersive experience, you'll love it.

**What I felt lackluster about ...**

 * Graphics and Voice Acting - These things do not have a big imact on game play but are present in the game and deserve reviewing. In these two arenas Neverwinter does not feel like a current generation MMORPG. Guild Wars 2 and Star Wars do a much better job here. Neverwinter character lip syncing is just OK and the graphics feel like they are from the previous generation of games. However both are still good enough for perfectly good immersion and game play.

 * Beta Qwerks - Overall the beta was very smooth. Nothing big to hum-and-haw about. However there were a couple annoyances; not being able to change zones unless everyone in your party was trying to zone and loot distribution (like chests) were a bit lacking.


Well that was supposed to be short!


**TL;DR**

LOVE

 * Superb and immersive lore
 * Perfect and fun action based but not twitchy combat

LIKE (really liked)

 * Game style and feel (it feels like D&amp;D, no really ...)
 * Character development (stats, feats, tiers, oh my)
 * Power set (2 dailies, 3 encounters, 2 at wills)
 * Traps, dieties, etc.

LACKLUSTER

 * Graphics and voice acting
 * Some small beta qwerks like zoning and loot distribution

Enjoy,

Hey there! Dracarys Drei'raeth again, member of the reddit guild Karma on Dragon and a dedicated Hero of the North Founder. 

Since the first announcement of my Foundry quest “Drei’raeth Caverns”, I have made leaps and strides in the development of the quest.  I would like to thank everyone who has given me their constructive feedback as it has helped tremendously.

For those who have completed my quest previously, I assure you it is a whole nother beast now.  It has been completely revamped from my first release, and for the better I think.  It has a much more epic, fiery, demonic, “Diabloesque” feel to it. As Diablo was a big inspiration for the design.

I am getting close to submitting my quest to Cryptic to be featured but still have a lot of work to do.  


**But I need your help!**


**The following major updates have been made since my 1.0 and 2.0 release**:

(I have gotten several reviews that the quest was “Too Easy” yet I have also gotten reviews that it was “Far too difficult to solo”.  In order to accommodate everyone I have made the following changes.  Please realize the difficulty of a quest dramatically scales at different levels.  What may be extremely easy for a level 10 player, could be outrageously hard at level 50.  The Author has no control over this so keep it in mind when assessing the difficulty.  I decided it is best to increase the overall difficulty so that it won’t be necessarily “easy” for anyone but it may require a friend or a party to complete it at certain adventure/gear levels.)

* Increased overall difficulty of the entire dungeon
* Decreased the physical length of the Caverns layout by almost 50%
* Decreased difficulty of Mordekai and Lokash, The Twin Demons of Gluttony encounter
* Increased the Physical Size of the Succubus Cha’lice, Demon of Lust and her Imp
* Increased the Physical Size of several other “standard” encounters to add a more epic experience
* Increased difficulty of Alabazz, Demon of Greed encounter and he now has a lot more minions to aid him
* Significantly increased the difficulty of Adramalech, Lord of Demons final encounter
* Spent over 24 hours customizing nearly every single monster in the map. (I wanted this quest to feel very unique!)
* Added several sound overlays and special effects for boss encounters
* Increased the level of detail and ambiance of every room throughout the Caverns
* Created Scripted boss encounters with dialogue and voice effects
* Removed “visible” traps
* Edited Mismatched Mob names and titles
* Added more of a variety of encounter types with different abilities
* And much much more!

For those who haven’t done my quest yet here is some background on it for those interested! I'd like to make this the best experience possible for players, and I need your help!  Please leave a constructive review at the end that relates to the actual Authoring of the quest.  

**Some keynotes**:

* **Eligible for daily foundry quest**
* Quest has a **4 star** rating based on 115 reviews as of today
* This quest IS **Soloable** BUT it is not easy for everyone.  I recommend bringing a friend if you’re not confident OR bringing plenty of potions and a cleric companion if you have one.  I solo it as a GWF with a Cleric Companion at level 33.
* Quest can be done as soon as you enter the protector’s enclave which is the first main city you get to at around level 4-5.
* Author has no influence over loot rewards whatsoever.
* ***Falling to your death due to mob knockback is no fault of the Author.  Please be aware of your surroundings and beware of cliff edges and lava pits.***
* You can access Drei’raeth Caverns from any gate and fast travel to it.  It is not a “zone” based quest.
* A true dungeon crawl feel! Inspired by action rpgs such as *Diablo.*

**OOC**: It is a gauntlet style quest approximately **20-30 min** long depending on how skilled you are. There is no real questing/story to it so far just some background lore but I’m up for ideas. This was originally designed as a quick, easy, simple, and fun daily foundry quest that doesn’t require a player to click through 100 quest dialogues and read a novel just to complete the quest.  Simply get to the end and survive all three chambers of sin and you are rewarded. Nice for players who just want to lay the smack down on some mobs and test builds. It has dense mob packs in a linear twisting cavern experience with soundtrack. It has three minor boss fights in between the maximum amount of monster encounters for a map in dense packs which makes for great AOE encounters.  You will also face a final main boss fight at the end. Grind quality is pretty good though not as fast as others though far less boring, due to the four boss fights you will encounter. So far users have loved it and I'm still looking for more reviews to add more content and tweak any bugs players point out! Try it out, and leave me your foundry and I will try yours in return!

The Drei'raeth of the Underdark are a notorious order of Drow Assassins. The Drei'raeth Caverns is the final training grounds for initiates in the order before being named an official Assassin of the Drei'raeth Order.

In hopes to improve their training, they have recently opened their training grounds to all who dare enter and are offering rewards for those who successfully complete the gauntlet. 

The player has to face three Chambers of Sin before facing Adramalech, Lord of Demons in the final Chamber.

* **Chamber of Lust - Cha'lice, Demon of Lust**
* **Chamber of Gluttony - Mordekai &amp; Lokash, Demons of Gluttony**
* **Chamber of Greed - Alabazz, Demon of Greed**

DIRECTIONS: Search for ""Drei'raeth Caverns"" in the foundry in game by pressing ""K"" then navigating to the foundry. Foundry can be done as soon as you reach the Protectors Enclave at about level 5 because it requires you to access the city gate in order to fast travel. Also this quest is not based on an over-world map which means you can access it directly by traveling using the city gate instead of actually having to go to a zone in order to enter it.

Message me at Dracarys Drei'raeth@ashenoak for any comments or questions or email me in game with suggestions! 

**EDIT**: Also I feel it is imperative that I remind you that there is an achievement for tipping the maximum amount after a foundry quest.

I am known as Joakim XVI (pm if you need handle) on Beholder with lvl 20 on mailsmithing, platesmithing and leatherworking (yes yes, Tailoring will be done before launch) and this is my first post in what I hope will be a series of profession related posts and guides. I always thought myself starting the guide with general 1-&gt;20 effiency guide, but I realised that 1) I most likely need to code a calculator for most efficient route from given startpoint. 2) People are quite efficient with their profession leveling as it is. Given this, I decided to attack the most common misbelief in Neverwinter since ""Opening boxes is worth it in the long run"". 

**Introduction: Leadership leveling**

The leadership is a profession for earning additional Gold, experience points, Astral Diamonds and chests that hold common consumables, profession resources enchants or runestones. Leadership is the only profession that does not need any resources/assets that you cannot make or buy from the profession vendor. This is the most common (mistaken) reason why leveling leadership is so popular, but we will get to that later. 

It's largely known that leadership is the slowest profession to level. Given one mercenary and one slot doing the best task possible (Explore Local Area, 40exp/h) it will take a little over 3700 hours to get from 1-20. Even in the best possible situation (9 slots 18 heros) the time is still 260 hours (Protect caravan, Explore local area, chart the region and 100% bonus, totaling 660exp/h). That is more than 10 days of updating tasks every 30mins. To a quick comparison, even the slowest way (just gathering materials with one slot and one white dude) is only 2600h in any other profession. With fastest route (crafting armors) and 9 slots 9 grandmaster this can be as fast as 26h. 

**Comparison: Leadership rewards vs tailoring**

Now, first reason people level leadership is the simple ""Well I do it since it gives me free AD every few hours."" While this is true, literally every other profession will give you AD so much faster. It gets funnier when you notice, that the more slots you have open, the more profitable other professions get. This comparison will be done with 3, 6 and 9 open slots, using best available assets. I will use tailoring as a comparison, to give leadership a change. let's pretend that you could buy 18 heroes at the same price as 9 grandmaster tailors (in reality, the difference is about 3 mil)

When using 3 slots, best task in leadership is Patrol the Mines, giving you a [Mining Claim], 10s and 120leadership experience for 4h. Since mining claims seem to go for 800ad in AH, assuming 3 slots, 6 heroes you would net 30s, 2160ad every 2h, thats 1080ad and 15s per hour (AH cut included). So how can we match this with tailoring? When writing this, a bolt of wool cloth costs 75ad on Beholder 150ad on Dragon (sorry no toon on Mindflayer, I'm a failure I know). Gather Wool Scraps and Weave Wool Cloth take 20minutes total and 60copper worth of thread. Assuming 3 Slots and 3 Grandmaster Tailors, you will net 24 bolts of woolcloths and lose 7s30c in a hour. Even with 75ad per piece, that is 1620ad/h (stupid auction house taking 10%). So you have to ask yourself, is sacrificing ~22 silver worth 600ad, to me it is. 

Notable things, I don't know if anyone actually buys mining claims, but I know that wool cloth sells like there is no tomorrow, and you could easily get 100 per piece if you sell in nice quantities (I usually pay more so I don't need to open 100+ mails of single item). With 100ad per piece, you are looking at a whopping 2160ad per hour, double the rate of leadership. You also need lvl13 in leadership, but only 1 in tailoring. Not to mention the prices of assets. Also, tailoring will take only about 54minutes, not 1h to get to 24, just used 24 to make it easier.

So, time for 6 slots then, next best thing in leadership is Explore Local Area giving you 1x [Local Map] per hour. They seem to sell for around 175 per piece. Meaning doing this in 3 slots with 6 heroes gives you a 675ad/h (AH cut included.) Added to the mining claiming leadership will be at 1755ad/h. 

Tailoring on the other hand does not suffer from the 3 task limit, since you can gather and weave as much as you like. In tailoring even lowest price for wool will give you 3240ad and lose you ~15s per hour. If we place wool cloth to 100ad/piece this will be as much as 4320ad/h

Lastly, we have the 9 slot (Although I know that there are only handful of players this far). The third best task in leadership is Protect Caravan, giving you 1 silver, 200ad and 40 leadership exp in 2h. Assuming 3 slots, 6 heroes for this task you will net a whopping 600ad 3silver per hour, increasing the total to 2355ad/h 18s/h. Tailoring will grow like always, giving a nice 4860ad/h at 75ad/piece or 6480ad/h at 100ad/piece with loss of ~23s/h. 

**Conclusion on rewards**

So, we see that leadership is hardly worth it even if you invest double the amount than normal profession, you still end up on the losing side. This conclusion is really to just sum things up. 

If we assume 30 gold is worth one key, and one key is worth 40k, the Patrol the Mines task will give one key per 200h, while tailoring will lose about half key in the same time. This adds 200ad/h to leadership (1280ad/h for 3slots) and subtract 100ad/h from tailoring (1520ad/h or 2060ad/h depending on price).

So the profits leveling don't cut the case for leadership, how about lvl 20 tasks. Unless the tooltip is wrong, even the epic [Very Large Chest of Goods] has chance for only blue material drops, and even the cheapest task for the chest costs 10k in materials, so no, not worth it by a long shot. Unless leadership gets drastic changes, I don't suggest it unless you are 20 in all the other professions (at which point, money is no longer an issue).

**Afterword**

So quite long start to a series. Please comment and give suggestions what profession related stuff you would like to see next. Hope this helps any of you. If you know sites that collect guides and are you consider worthy, give me a tip and I will publish on them as well

**TL:DR**

Ugh, I know someone will need this, so here is a simple table:

**Leadership**

| slots |               TASK                 |      REWARDS/H       |  
|    3   |      3x Patrol the Mines       |      1080ad 15s        |  
|    6   |     3x Explore local area      |          675ad            |  
|    9   |       3x Protect caravan       |        600ad, 3s        |  

Total: 2355ad, 18s per hour

**Tailoring wool at 75/piece**

| slots |               TASK                    |      REWARDS/H       |  
|    3   |  3xGather + 3xWeave Wool  |          1620ad           |  
|    6   |  3xGather + 3xWeave Wool  |          1620ad           |  
|    9   |  3xGather + 3xWeave Wool  |          1620ad           |  

Total: 4860ad -23s per hour.

Unless they COMPLETELY overhaul the zen store, I see no future at all for this game, which is a shame. Hopefully Cryptic and other companys learn from this mistake. Gamers can smell bull-shit from a mile away, and their store just reeks of it.

I really, REALLY wish the store and end-game were better. I had such high hopes for this game, being both a D&amp;D fan and a fan of MMOs. The kicker is, I would of easily dropped hundreds of dollars on this game if they werent so blatantly greedy, and I know I'm not alone.


TL;DR: PWE ruined an otherwise awesome game with their greed. Hopefully future MMOs learn from this.

**Account wide items**

* Dawn unicorn mount

Epic mount that is semicool looking, 3000zen if it's 110%, if more, then nearly priceless depending on other mounts released at the fury.

* Sylph companion

Even being a account wide companion, damage companions are generally not worth it and you are better of getting phoeras anyway, 500zen total.

* Fashion set

Depending on looks, about 250zen per character

* Loamweave enchantment.

Again depends on the stats, but its atleast worth 200zen per lvl 60 character

* Stone of Earth

If this is what I think it is, a epic augmentation pet, this is easily worth 3000zen per character. If its something else, then not so much.


**One per account items**

* Moon elf race

Races are always hard to value, but i'd wager if the stats are good and a new class is released, i could pay 500-1000zen for this, so lets say 500zen

* Adventurer's helper pack

Nice pack, worth 1500zen in zen market

* 600k AD

This is about 1700zen more or less.

So all in all, you get pretty nice return to your investment at least if stone of earth is actually a augmentation companion.

I'm pretty new to the MMO scene and Neverwinter is the first MMO where I've almost reached the level cap. One thing I've noticed is that there seems to be a push for people to just move along the quest line without stopping to ""smell the roses"" as I like to call it. There are lots of cool places to visit and many amazing sights to be seen that just can't be seen if you are just power leveling. Maybe that's all you want though and I see no problem with that. I prefer to explore more than PvE or PvP, so I started up a Tumblr of some of the places I've been with screenshots taken in some hard to reach or otherwise less obvious to find locations. My goal is to eventually get nice screen shots for each of the areas that could possibly be used as desktop backgrounds for interested parties. For example, here is one that I took of Neverdeath Graveyard http://i.imgur.com/G7YnnpA.jpg As I explore the areas, I keep my eyes out for locations to get a birds eye view from and a different angle than the scrying stones give me. 

If anyone has any questions, I'll be glad to answer them, unless you are asking how I got to these locations. I probably shouldn't reveal the routes I use unless its PWE asking me (in which case I'll tell them) :) Also I'm looking for feedback as well. Any feedback is welcomed but specifically I'm looking to know if people prefer the screenshots with or without my character. I couldn't decide on that but I'm starting to lean towards removing my character from the shot unless people say otherwise.

If there are any requests of areas you would like for me to try to take a nice screenshot of let me know and I'll try to find a way to do it. Remember that I'm not a GM so I'm still limited to the locations I can travel by jumping and dashing.

The final fight was EPIC, with almost our entire team dropping when the boss was at 3% health!!  The two of us that were up ran around and got people back up, during which time the boss healed back up to 30% HP, which we were able to clear and drop the boss.  It took just over 20 min, so certianly not a speed run or effiecent run, but man was it fun!

Apparently Star Trek and Champions Online both feature this system as well, but I never played either of those.

I have like no cinematography skills, but [this is an example](http://youtu.be/0PDPbrAhdmw) to get an idea of what I'm talking about.  Anyone who makes gameplay videos or trailers and is willing to put in the time can make some great looking stuff, I'm sure.

All you do is ""/demo_record *filename*"" while in game, and it begins recording your gameplay until you hit a loading screen or do a ""/demo_record_stop"" command.  Once you issue the stop command, your game will freeze for a bit depending on how long you were recording, while it writes the file.  On Windows 7 with the default install the files are located under Users\Public\Games\Cryptic\Neverwinter\live\demos.

Then you can use [a program to play back the demo file](http://sourceforge.net/projects/readcrypticdemo/) (you don't need a 3rd party program, I'm just too lazy to use the command line interface in the launcher) and while playing it back you have control over the camera.

1367808116.0,19,self.Neverwinter,1drp0c,"For TR's interested in maxing out their damage output, me and a friend ran some math on Str vs Cha values",bladeofwill,23,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1drp0c/for_trs_interested_in_maxing_out_their_damage/,"This is intended for TR's who end up with 2/3 points into the Disciple of Strength feat and 5/5 in Underhanded Tactics, as they seem to be the important feats for maximizing dps.

First off, I do not know if combat advantage has an inherient damage bonus, and I was unable to find information on it. I found the point at which an inherent bonus would make Str = Cha, and did some comparisons for the min/max values of my race (HOrc). My friend Aurorae went the extra step and compared bonus damage values for all possible stat combinations. (Also, I probably made a mistake somewhere. Please point it out to me. I'm sorry)

If the damage formula is additive
base * (1 + 1.04*str bonus + 1.2(CA bonus + CHA bonus))

and cha &gt; str due to the 1.04 ratio compared to the 1.2 ratio, simple
Additive bonuses dont make much sense, but assuming things is bad, so it might be this simple.

however, if the formula is multiplicative
base * (1 + 1.04*str bonus) * (1 + 1.2(CA bonus + CHA bonus))

its a whole different beast

Doing the math for my HOrc rogue's possible stats (max str/cha and str/ max cha, set equal to each other, solve for CA), CHA = STR when CA = .08 (roughly).

If the base CA bonus = 0, (assuming an easy 1000 base damage) maxed STR hits for 1255.5776 damage and maxed CHA hits for 1262.976 damage. If I did my math properly, this means there is a 0.5875% difference between the two numbers.

Aurorae does an even better comparison [here](http://i.imgur.com/4F68lCG.png) showing the lvl 60 stats (assuming all level up points go into str/cha and you have the campfire buff) and the final damage multiplier in column AB with the max and min values labeled. Max points into Str/Cha *seems* like the best damage investment, as it scales well with all damage stats (and a 1% flat damage increase is superior to a 1% crit chance increase from dex).

In conclusion, Cha is superior to Str when you have combat advantage. Look at the numbers for yourself to decide if you think your CA uptime is going to be worth going max Cha, or if you want to shift to Str somewhat. I *think* that if you have CA for 99.4%~ or less of your damage  maxed str over cha is superior in a minor way (probably wrong, but anyway). The difference is so minor most of the time that you will not notice.

Of course, if bonus damage is additive, its all moot D: ",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_1drp0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1drp0c/for_trs_interested_in_maxing_out_their_damage/,

The first screen you will encounter when creating your first character is the race selection screen.

When you've chosen your race you are presented with the character class screen. Here's a list of the classes and their ingame description.

##Control Wizard
Control Wizards harness powerful arcane energies to restrict, crush and debilitate their foes. Wielding a magical orb, they are capable of unleashing torrents of damage alongside an adventuring party, and use ice and force to manipulate the movements of unwitting creatures.  
[→List of Control Wizard Powers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1a11l5/control_wizard_powers/)  

##Devoted Cleric
The Devoted Cleric is a devout healer, committed to preventing injury, restoring health, and faith in the divine. Capable of controlling the battlefield with a combination of territory control and righteous holy damage, precise zone placement and strategic calculation are necessary traits for the Devoted Cleric.  
[→List of Devoted Cleric Powers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1a1sz0/devoted_cleric_powers/)

##Guardian Fighter
The Guardian Fighter is courageous and stalwart, superior at defensive maneuvers, and no stranger to hand-to-hand combat. Heavy plate armor and a shield make the Guardian Fighter a durable mainstay on the battlefield, while a trusty longsword and focused aggression cut through foes that stand in the way.  
[→List of Guardian Fighter Powers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1a0z8e/guardian_fighter_powers/)  

##Trickster Rogue
The master of stealth and misdirection, the Trickster Rogue maneuvers across the battlefield and strikes from the shadows with paired daggers. The Trickster Rogue dodges in and out of melee, inflicting massive damage on foes with a flurry of deadly blows.

Next screen is the Ability Scores screen where you roll for your starting stats. You will also choose your racial ability bonus(+ more stats).  
You can reroll as many times as you please but each stat type (primary, secondary etc.) has a celling. The celling for your primary stat is 18, but it can go up to 20 if choosing the right race.

The fourth screen is the Appearance customization screen. Here you get quite a lot of customization, everything from hair to the thickness of the feet. Their are of course presets as well if this is not your cup of tea.

The final screen is the overview screen where you can see all the choices you make and finally write down the name you wish to use for your character. You name may have spaces and it doesn't matter if someone else has taken your name before due to their @handler system. You may also enter a Biography which is displayed when inspected ingame.

Since this guide was written during the beta weekend events it might not reflect how the actual character creation process will look like when the game is released.

However, this does cost around 1-10k AD and I am not completely sure what the price is based on.  I assume the price is based on the Item Level of the gear whose appearance you are changing.

For example I currently have these two appearance changes:

* Two Handed Sword &gt; Two Handed Axe

* Necklace &gt; Cloak

Once you change an items appearance I have not yet found a way to revert that change.  It is permanent.  The item you used to change the appearance is also CONSUMED, you will never have that item again.  The looks are just transferred to the other item and it disappears.

What is also important to note is say I change a necklace/medallion to a cloak.  Then 5 levels later I find an upgrade and its another necklace but I want the appearance of the same cloak again.  You can use the same necklace you changed earlier to change the new necklace and it will use the appearance of the cloak.  

So whatever Item has the current appearance on it, it has that appearance forever and it can also be used again to change another items appearance but every time you do it the item is destroyed but the appearance is sent to the new item.

I sure hope it isn't some scheme to apply hidden nerfs without much of the player base noticing. 


I used a lv 17 cleric that was stripped naked (except for weapon) with the target dummy as my victim. I had no relevant divinity or AP gain talents besides 2/5 domain synergy(which is something really interesting, elaboration in a bit). According to the character sheet my bonus AP gain was 4.3%, 4% from charisma and 0.3% from a tiny amount of recovery on my weapon (yes i'm a stingy *******). Interestingly the 2% from domain synergy was not reflected here, which makes me wonder if the whole talent itself is bugged or the character sheet is bugged. 
I only have access to a small selection of powers, so bear with me here.


AP gain:
lance = 1%

astral seal = ~1.66666666666.... %

searing light = 5%

blazing chains = 6%

sunburst = 5% X no. of targets hit (!!!)

divine pips had no effect on AP gain and I couldn't check healing word since you actually need to heal damage to get AP and divinity. Crit appears to have no effect on AP gain.

1 pip of Divinity is approximately equal to:

~ 15 lances of faith (~6.66666666... %)

~ 9 astral seals (~11.111..... %)

~ 3 searing light / sunburst (~33.333333.... %)

~ 2 blazing chains + 2 lances of faith (~43.3333... %)


Crits didn't seem to help divinity gain significantly, if it did at all.

If someone has a nice and bored partner, send them out to take some damage in a hostile area and u can test the AP and divinity gain of healing powers. By no means do I claim these numbers to be 100% true, double check them with your own character and let's demystify this stuff (when calculating AP gain it's best to reset to 0% completely using your daily power if you're about to switch over to a different skill) !",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_1dq3l8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dq3l8/ap_divine_power_gain_for_cleric_powers/,

Search for the quest on the board in-game,It is called **Hunting with Vayne**, **Quest ID is: NW-DPWAKA49Y**

You may have to click on the ""For Review"" tab to see Quests that have not yet been reviewed in order to play it.

It should be fairly difficult for a group of 5 level ~20 players and I hope you enjoy it.

* Campfires added before and after difficult encounters.
* Music / FX added via triggers (Note music was already in each map but there is a bug that prevents it from playing, cryptic are looking into it apparently).
* Vayne disappearing / dying - This is a tricky one to solve but VERY important to me so I am working on it for this  quest and also the next installment.\

**UPDATE 2:** Added difficulty selection, speak to the ghost to choose how many enemies you fight.

i am a 60 GW leveling up was somewhat enjoyable pretty basic somewhat repetitive.

The biggest gripe with the game is EVERY boss / mini boss from ending quest/zone and Dungeon/epic dungeon is the same. 
1. Boss has some kind of AOE
2. Adds come in
3. repeat for 10-20min

I did 80% of the dungeons and its all the same i would've LOVED to see something different but it never happened it's SUPER boring.

i really hope they put some effort into making boss fights more interesting for the survival of the game. Take a note from Tera and Subtract 50-70% of the trash and give these bosses something interesting anything other then insert random aoe ability summon add.

hope to play this game in another month or two to see what happens GLHF!

If you already have a Blue Dog of your own and got more and want to donate to the Give Away, mail them to me at (@Mustkillall100) or if you have extra bags you do not want, mail them to me too :D. If you do mail me something, please mail your Reddit Username with it and I'll include it on the post as a person who Donated :D

Thank you, and have a good time killing things :D 

Edit: If you are on Dragon, please send it to BootyBumper@mustkillall100.

Edit: As of right now, this is only happening on Dragon due to the fact that there is no Cross-Server mail. If you would like to host a give-away on Beholder or Mindflayer please post here.

Edit: Going to bed now, send any bags or Blue dogs you would like to donate, I'll be back in a few hours to farm more bags and try to get more dogs. And if you would like a chance to win, Please COMMENT with your REDDIT AND NEVERWINTER Name please.

I recently tried EvE, and going back to WoW, but honestly, NeverWinter ""WoW""-ed me way more. It's combat is boss, and the people are bosserer, and I've never had more fun leveling up, where i'm looking forward to every level, not farming for 2 months wishing I were at end game, because you're leveling by playing in a well structured story. Neverwinter was different though, it is huge and It has all the attributes of ""RPG"" I yearned for, but what bugs me is the lack of ""MMO"" in it. EVE has really slow and boring combat, but there are massive guild or ""Corporation"" armies warring over territories and that itself gives me a hard-on. Instanced PvP is taking away alot of the feel that you're actually fighting for something other than points and against random people in your queue that you'll never fight again. Put some guild grudges, put some flare, put some on-going global action! I hope you add some guild territory, war, and housing systems, that would be freaking boss of the NW team, and I hope people reading this would agree with me too!

Well know this there is a way to get the ""Return to Instance"" button to appear without having to log out or close the game. When this problem occurs you can actually do two different things to get the ""Return to Instance"" button to appear:

1. Click the little rune looking thing on the top right of your map and select a different instance # other than the one your in and transfer to it. When you load in the ""Return to Instance"" button will be there. (For instance, if I am in Protector's Enclave I will transfer to a different instance where there are different players and the button will appear.

2. If the rune looking thing is darkened and you can't click on it just go to a Travel Gate and travel to a different location and when you load in the ""Return to Instance"" button will be there. (For instance if you are in Protector's Enclave just travel to a different location like Ebon Downs or Blacklake District and the button will be there, Note: it doesn't matter what location you choose it will work either way.

1367941689.0,16,self.Neverwinter,1dv8aw,How I decided to love NWO despite its flaws,clisby,28,12,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dv8aw/how_i_decided_to_love_nwo_despite_its_flaws/,"So I am enjoying Neverwinter thus far but got roped into the ""OMG end-game is p2w I can't go on"" mindset.  I thought further about it though and came up with my new perspective which fixes everything(for me). This is all my opinion, keep in mind.

Many MMO's are a lifestyle (WoW, etc).  NWO is f2p because it is not meant to be a lifestyle.  The devs don't expect most players to ONLY play NWO.  If I am paying a sub fee, I feel obligated to play the game.

1)  Like D&amp;D it's about grabbing some of your friends and playing through a new dungeon.  The foundry provides an endless amount of this.  D&amp;D is not necessarily geared towards 20 man raids, epic competitive PvP, etc.
2)  Developing and balancing classes takes time and money -- I don't think NWO had that.  I don't see that they allocated their efforts elsewhere so I imagine they simply could not afford to put in the classes.  I believe this is why they will add more classes once they get some cash flow.  They developed a class for most types of players to start.
3)  Some classes are imba because they are trying to make fun classes.  The abilities for all the classes I've played feel impactful and satisfying.  I think the classes are tuned to be fun, not necessarily to min/max who should be in a dungeon.
4)  I think PvP is fun, but since PvE is the focus the PvP designers have their hands tied as far as balance.  Many MMO vets have seen how PvP balances can harm the enjoyment of a class in PvE.  I believe PvP balances will be very slowly implemented.
5)  Lower graphics, crosshair *targeting*, lower difficulty and limited abilities allows a larger audience.  Your friends with garbage PC's and limited gaming skills can jump in and have fun. My girlfriend enjoys this.  Also the resource cost to implement the former two may have been too costly.  
6)  Respecs are pricey, which sucks.  BUT I don't feel they are super necessary as focusing on DPS abilities as a cleric, I can still heal more than enough for any dungeon thus far.  I think the invested points aren't as impactful as many are thinking.  This isn't like most other MMO's, IMO.
7)  There are P2W elements, but they aren't really necessary for any of the content I have encountered(again I don't use NWO for my PvP fix).  I could make myself super OP and my friends and I could totally burn through every dungeon with absolutely zero effort but this is essentially like opening the console on an FPS and enabling infinite ammo and invincibility on any game.  You can demolish the content but how the satisfaction level is generally much lower.  Think of it like ""OK in Borderlands 2, if you pay Gearbox $50 additional, you can enable the console and all the cheats in multiplayer mode.""  I wouldn't want to play with any of my friends if they were to enable cheats -- perhaps big-head mode and paintball mode (RIP Goldeneye).

I really agree with nearly all the criticisms as well as all the praise. I am just taking a different approach than many.  I am still playing GW2 for sPvP and world events -- it feels more like an MMO to me.  I am playing NWO when I feel like getting a dungeon run with some friends -- it feels mostly like a coop RPG to me.  I am playing LoL when I feel like getting flamed(hue).  

tl;dr:  It's a fun co-op ARPG to play with your friends.  The flaws are there, but if you see it this way then they aren't as painful.  The cash shop doesn't necessarily cause problems for the casual have-fun types.

Step seven: Click the third tab in this same window, ""My Listings.""

Step nine: Log out of this character, and log into the character you would like to transfer AD to.

You will want to buy the Mortar, Cruicible, and philosophers stone from the professions vendor as well as a few stacks of brimstone and solvent.

Once you have the workers you need to start ""Gather Simple Components, this gives you 1 Simple Pelt and 1 Pine Wood. 

From there you can create a simple vitriol Extraction which will give you 1 Blue and 1 Green Vitriol. 

Once you have the extractions you will want to do the Rank 1 Experimentation, you can only make one of these at a time, so if you have more than one apothecary, use them to gather more resources while you wait.

The Experimentation will give you unstable potions and can (but not always) give a recipe for a potion and the Basic Alchemical research scroll.

Once you have the scroll and a free apothecary You can do the  Alchemical Research which will give you the experience to level up.

Make sure you check ahead for the recipie for the next experimentation because some of them appear to require the prior potions you were given recipies for (such as the minor Rejuvenaton Potion).
 
Wash rinse repeat.  It follows that same pattern, all the way down for most things.

Once you make it to Rank 2 experimentation, note that you may not get the Scrolls everytime and you need 3 for the next level. Keep running experimentations untill you can move on and collect resources as you do. Don't do the Deep Gather or mass extrations it's a HUGE waste of time unless you aren't going to be at the computer for 6 hours.

This is a good sign, i could tell that they were botters because they ran in tandom, always to the middle and never farther, sat there half naked, and just spammed magic missile, nothing else, that and they both had completely randomly generated names.

Levels 1-5 were what everyone experiences on their first play through, getting used to the controls and UI, and learning to dodge/kill things. As I progressed into the 6-15 range and picked up some abilities I was finding dealing with mobs a bit easier.  I did notice that in the early 15 levels or so, Ranged mobs (Tier 1 or Tier 2 mobs) were absolutely wrecking me, and as such had to be dealt with quickly.  Potion consumption in the first 15 levels was at a moderate pace of which I assumed was normal for classes (having since leveled a TR and CW I can say it is not the norm).  

Leveling from 16-25 went without much effort, but a slower pace than others I knew playing the game.  The cleric companion did wonders at first but often dies to things in the first 5 seconds of combat, which to me seems bad that something so vital to some classes dies so quickly, but that is another tale.  Around the level 30-35 range, I had picked up enough skills to deal high amounts of burst and was killing things at a good pace.  Granted around this level was when the AoE really took off and with Unstoppable + WMS, and zones were no riddled with weaker tier 1 mobs so the leveling rate increased drastically.  I feel the 30-55ish range is where GWF excels and those levels went by in a fun-filled blur of Takedowns, Restoring Strikes, Flourishes, Indom Battle Strikes, and WMS clones wrecking shop.  I had high hopes as I headed into the fiery mountains.

Sadly around this level is where things slow down DRASTICALLY.  Mobs live longer, deal vastly more damage, and the cleric is dead within 2 seconds of combat leaving me to chain chug pots best I can manage.  I remember clearly the Temple of the Primordial being the HARDEST thing I had ever had to solo in this game, and my gold was quickly depleting with how many pots I was forced to go through.  As I headed into the home stretch of 58-60 I pretty much had my end game build for both pve and pvp set up, feats were all in place, and I quickly was starting to realize how far apart I was from other classes in every aspect.  There is no doubt that TR is the higher dps class, or the GF has vastly better survivability, but I feel that GWF should have SOMETHING it excels at, and when I dinged 60 started pvp and soon found out even after full pvp gear and a variety of tactics to live / kill every class I came against, I found we are just not good at anything.

Another thing I will note is I dinged 60 with still level 34 items.  The RNG on identify gear / gear for quests sucking is just awful.  

We have to try so hard to kill anything and die easier than any other class on our gear level, some even below it.  I mentioned we should be excelling at something, so far the only thing I found that GWF could do well is ninja cap bases, mostly due to everyone forgetting they are there, or in pve mass AoE trash or waves of T1 mobs.  That being said the play style of the class feels great, so I do believe the class is worth playing but sadly the state of the game right now they are just far less valuable than say an extra TR or CW.
****
**TLDR**
  
* GWF Level 1-5: Same as Everyone

* GWF Level 6-15: Ranged mobs deal a lot of damage, really no way to mitigate it, chain chug pots, pull slowly

* GWF Level 16-25: More pots, all the pots, Cleric pet dies a lot, starting to see more damage

* GWF Level 26-35: Less pots than usual, Cleric still dies, damage steadily increasing, seems to be a gear shortage
 
* GWF Level 35-55: Great AoE, Zones well built for GWF, Cleric still a noob, still lack of gear, quick levels

* GWF Level 55-60: Utter hell, still no gear, spent all my gold on pots and still ran out, PvP really shows our lack of output / usefulness, PvE just as bad. 

****

**Improvements would be:**

* Either a buff to defense or damage, TR bursts mobs b4 it is an issue, GF mitigates them, we are smack in the center with neither and it hurts...bad.

* Better gear choices/quest gear, RNG is RNG on identify gear but when all the quest gear is Arm pen / Recovery and no Power/Crit/Defense it sucks hard.

* Small tuning buffs in the 16-25 / 55-60 range could make the leveling more enjoyable, I find the challenge nice but I feel it is artificially created by class dynamics.

* Reliance on potions far to heavy for this class, Restoring Strike healing output buff could fix perhaps for leveling.


That is all I have for now, I am currently leveling other classes to see how they stack up in leveling/endgame experience.  TR has been the most fun, CW the close second, Cleric and GF while both fun just don't tickle my fancy.

**EDIT:  Thank you all for the replies and input, to make it so others don't have to dig through comments, I'll summarize some responses:**

* Check AH/Vendors for gear responses - Some Servers AH's have not a lot of options, I'm curious if it was just Beholder when I leveled, but from the time I hit 60 and even till after I got full PvP gear there was nothing on the AH above the mid 30's in level.  And the few greens that were in the 40's had all sub par stats.  Vendors were the same from what I saw, although I may have missed 1 or 2 items, but that didn't really matter once I got full epic PvP gear.  Even then the vast gap between classes is obvious.  

* Cleric Companion + def bonus runes - May have been something to check into, I went HP / Def, but didnt pay to level him to 30, it may be vastly different with a level 30 companion than a 15.  

**EDIT 2:**  

* Seems that 90% of the comments are directed at bashing the fact I found no upgrades via AH or w/e...you may be right that NOW there are more option in the AH, but at the time of my leveling there wasn't and my problem isn't with the community driven economy, it is with the fact that quest rewards and such by and large were just useless.  Also the gear issue was quickly solved in about 5 hours of PvP which yielded full epics, and the story as far as class performance was the same.   

* Some have PM'd asking what build I ran:  At Wills were Sure Strike and WMS, Encounters were Takedown, IBS, and Flourish while Come and Get It was also toyed with a bit for gap closing / peeling.  Dailys were Crescendo and Slam, and my Class Features were Steel Blitz and Destroyer with the feats to reduce target # restrictions.

Message me at Dracarys Drei'raeth@ashenoak for any comments or questions or email me in game with suggestions! I'd like to make this the best experience possible for players, and I need your help!

The Drei'raeth of the Underdark are a Notorius order of Drow Assassins.  The Drei'raeth Caverns is the final training grounds for initiates in the order before being dubbed an official Assassin of the Drei'raeth Order.  

In hopes to improve their training, they have recently opened their training grounds to all who dare enter and are offering rewards for those who successfully complete the gauntlet as well as a listing of their name in the Hall of Fame.

OOC: It is a gauntlet style quest approximately 20-30 min long depending on how skilled you are. There is no real questing/story to it, just get to the end and you are finished and rewarded.  Nice for players who just want to lay the smack down on some mobs and test builds.  It has dense mob packs in a linear twisting cavern experience with soundtrack. It has 3 minor boss fights in between the maximum amount of ""easy"" mob encounters. Grind quality is comparable to ""Easy Mob Training Grounds"" though far less boring. So far users have loved it and I'm still looking for more reviews to add more content and tweek any bugs players point out! Try it out, or leave me your foundry and I will try yours in return!  

NOTE: Search for ""Drei'raeth Caverns"" in the foundry in game by pressing ""K"" then navigating to the foundry.  Foundry can be done as soon as you reach the Protectors Enclave at about level 5.  Also this quest is not based on an over-world map which means you can access it directly by traveling using the city gate instead of actually having to go to a zone in order to enter it.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1368452640.0,,gwf,True,t3_1dh7uz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dh7uz/foundry_quest_dreiraeth_caverns_reviews_needed/,

What do people think will actually happen to the economy based on this?  I have some guesses about what will actually impact players:
People will be much less likely to buy Zen either in the exchange or directly from PWE until this normalizes.

* In the Zen/AD exchange, ~~Zen will be devalued~~  **EDIT: I'm an idiot, *diamonds* will be devalued** until the Astral Diamond flood gets stepped down.  ~~Most people will not be buying Zen for AD.~~ **EDIT: *Unless* they have huge amounts of AD, legit or otherwise** However there may still be people purchasing from the Zen shops if they don't have huge amounts of Diamonds.

* Auction House will be hugely inflated in terms of AD prices. I actually see this as a *good* thing for people who don't currently have a large amount of Astral Diamonds since those with more resources will pay *a lot more* for items. I would expect to see the price for Residuum and other crafting mats go up, and in general selling gear will be profitable.

* The time investment for non-auction AD sources will just not be worth it for most people.  Leadership and praying/daily events won't be worth it until the AD inflation goes down.

Over time I would expect to see everything slowly revert to what we had before.

I think it's ridiculous that to get full experience you need to kill much slower than you want to.  There's no exploit in any of these quests, it would be the same as grinding on any random mobs, but inside the foundry you get screwed.  Even in story quests you'll end up running into the cap, and any fight that involves a couple of encounters at once will give crap exp.

I don't see why they didn't implement some system that caps you for killing a whole slew of mobs at once, or to check if they can't fight back and restrict you on that.

Hi everyone,

A few changes to the Rogue will be going to Preview with the next patch:

**At-Wills Depleting Stealth**

In the end, this change didn't really solve the issues that we wanted it to. There are still some exploitative ways to play the Rogue that we're looking at, but this change didn't end up solving the core issue and hurt normal (and creative) gameplay. **At-Will powers will no longer deplete your stealth.**

**Lurker's Assault**

It would be tough to argue that Lurker's Assault didn't need some re-tuning. The damage bonus on it was just too extreme for both PVE and PVP. That said, the change to crit severity ended up being a bit too weak and favored certain feat builds too much. **Lurker's Assault 5/10/15% crit severity has been replaced with 15/20/25% damage and the duration is back to 10 seconds.**

I hope you all know that you have a huge impact on the direction of the game. The Preview shard isn't just a grace period before changes go live; it is a testing ground. We rely on getting lots and lots of feedback from you guys to make sure we're taking the game in the right direction.

Thanks for being so outspoken and passionate about the TR

I'm writing this from personal experience from my first run. Use this as a first hand template of general information.*

Gauntlgrym is a 3 stage event that takes around 1 1/2 hours to complete. It involves two factions fighting for domination in a combination of objective, PvP and dungeon events.

The first stage is a PvE stage, in which multiple objectives are given in an isolated map. The objectives involve killing elementals and harvesting their shards to power nearby objectives and killing the nearby mobs in order to obtain items such as broken weapons.
These items are then 'reforged' or 'reinforced' at their respective (now powered) objectives. These objectives are repeatable and continue until the time is up. The more items that are handed in, the more credit your faction receives.
All players are visible within range on the minimap and it seemed effective to roam in small groups of no less than 3 to kill the mobs efficiently to obtain their drops.
The winning faction for this stage receives a 10% damage mitigation buff for the second stage and a scroll called Iron Tabernacle Share.


The second stage appears to be two events running in parallel, one PvE and one PvP. One of these events involves collecting nearby boulders and lumber to build and load up catapults, and collecting food (from barrels) and artifacts (from chests and mob drops) to please a large giant man.
 The second event involves queuing up for an exclusive PvP event. This event is similar to Domination PvP apart from there are now 20 players on each team and there are 5 capture nodes. This PvP event's objective is to obtain the most amount of points within the time limit.
The interesting part of this stage is that succeeding in controlling the catapults (in Event 1) results in random bombardments in Event 2, and pleasing the Giant (in Event 1) results in friendly, very strong NPCs aiding you in Event 2. In my run I found pleasing the Giant was VERY effective. The NPCs were very strong and split into groups that guarded and patrolled the PvP arena.
The winning faction receives a scroll called Armories of Moradin Share.


The final stage is a pure 5-man dungeon stage. All players are warped back to the initial Gauntlgrym area where you can find a group. There are 2 dungeons, one rewarding Tier 1 loot and one rewarding Tier 2 loot. The winners of both stages (assuming you have both Scrolls receives in Stages 1 &amp; 2) are eligible for the Tier 2 dungeon. 
I ran the Tier 2 dungeon. It's very short and the trash mobs are very simple. The boss however was very tough and my group managed to get him to 60% HP before wiping (and our mage rage quit).

Yeah..that's it really. I shall answer some questions now.

**How can I join/travel to Gauntlgrym?**

First you need to join a guild, any guild as long as they are affiliated with one of the two factions. The guild leader must affiliate his guild by talking to the Guild Registrar at the top of Protector's Enclave. He will give a quest which will lead him to picking an affiliation. Once you are affiliated you can travel to Gauntlgrym via one of the city gates.

**How do I take part in Gauntlgrym**

To take part you simply need to be in the Gauntlgrym area (I think of it as a lobby) when the Event starts. You can check to see when the Event is happening next by pressing L and looking down the bottom for The Iron Tabernacle. You can not take part in Gauntlgrym without the Event. You can be by yourself or with a group of friends when the Event starts and you'll be ported together into the instance to start Stage 1.

**I'm overwhelmed by what's going on, help?**

Use the map and take note of the objectives on the right side of your screen. You typically need to find mobs to kill for their loot and take the loot to their respective nodes. You'll be told the name of these mobs/places, just cross-reference with the map.

**I'm on Stage 1, I've handed my items in, now what?**

Keep killing mobs and handing more in. It's a repeatable, continuous objective until the timer has reached 0.

**I'm on Stage 2, any basic strategies?**

Everyone seemed a little lost initially. Most groups appear to try and zerg in a circular direction. Avoid this if possible. Tactical, smaller assaults on places the enemy has only just captured seemed effective. If you have the Giant's aid and his badass mercenaries are on your side, stick with them on point. They hurt.

**I'm on Stage 3 in the Tier 2 dungeon, any basic strategies?**

I never finished it but as a healer this is what I learned. You need a CW to control the mobs that appear. They're not TOO frequent so killing them might be an option. The boss himself does massive amounts of damage when he does his large AoE circle. At ~75% health he jumps out of his suit and some sort of green poisonous gas will erupt shortly after. This will hurt everyone so keep burst heals for then. That's all I really know...sorry.

This is all I've learned, hopefully it is of some help here. If you have any questions I'll try and answer them.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1371797219.0,,,True,t3_1gqw8s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1gqw8s/gauntlgrym_some_rough_information_from_a_noob/,

I hope it's not against the rules to share Foundry maps. I had been sitting on this mission for nearly a month until the awful sound bug in the Foundry was fixed, and now I've finally published it and it's a total bugbear(hurr) to actually get people to try it.


So try it! The map is a light dungeon crawl with a major emphasis on building a tense atmosphere, and contextual storytelling through environment and clues rather than having NPCs exposit walls of text all over you. All of the environments are lovingly handmade and there is a large amount of effort put into scripting sound and visuals, especially in the climax of the mission.


It's best experienced as a solo adventure, and takes around 25-30 minutes, though you can certainly blitz through it in 15 minutes or so if you just follow the critical path.

*It just today became eligible for rewards*, so maybe give it a spin while you're doing your dailies.

Short code is **NW-DQ8I5BZSF**, or you can search the title. *I'm more than happy to field any questions about technical stuff in the map from other authors, or read feedback on the quest here*

So here are my impressions in a very basic manner:

The game is ""made"" very well, combat is fun and fluid and the graphics have a cute but very detailed look about them. The server was robust and solid with alot of people running about doing their own thing. The f2p model is the same as STO which I love.

The problem and this is often overlooked by skill grinders and mmo folk is the game world/community. In Neverwinter the world just feels like a hollow shell to the next dungeon. I have no attachment to the world and the it just feels empty and souless. If I dont feel the attachment to the world I am very unlikely to stick through/spend money on it. Maybe its the D&amp;D license or the NPC's. Its character names suck too!

*The fourth Beta Weekend for Neverwinter is coming, and you are on the list! This Beta Weekend is our way of thanking you for supporting our game. You are getting the first look at Professions, Gateway, and our new system that allows you to choose your powers as you level up!* 

*Neverwinter will be available to play starting April 12th at 12pm Pacific (PDT), and then closing on April 14th at 11:59pm Pacific (PDT).* 

*There will be five Professions available to satisfy your crafting appetite: Leadership, Tailoring, Leatherworking, Mailsmithing, and Platesmithing. Each profession will have their own set of required assets and rewards!* 

*You will also be able to utilize Gateway, our web portal that lets you continue working on your Professions and managing items on the Auction House from anywhere with internet access! You can also view your character's gear, stats, and guild activity.* 

*Last but not least, we have listened to your feedback and instituted a new system that lets you choose your powers as you level up, rather than being stuck in a linear progression! Each power has multiple ranks, and as you spend points leveling them up you unlock tiers of new powers!* 

*If you have not done so yet, you can download the client here!* 

*For any issues when logging in, please contact Customer Support.*

This means your level 10 guy can get 6,700 AD for 2 minutes of work.


Once you have a profession at level 1, but no people to do anything you get a new quest called 'Emergency Hire'


It takes 18 hours to do (just like all the hire quests) and you repeat


I recommend Hiring Weavers for the best bang for your buck. This gives you roughly 88 AD per hour per slot.

No quest in leadership gives you this much AD per hour. (protect caravan is 50 per hour)


If you spend any time leveling up a profession, go Tailoring, and get it so you can Train Outfitters. Outfitters go for 10,000 AD right now. Thats 138 AD hour based on a 72 hour hiring cycle.

GWF perspective,ezymode,15,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1g034f/playing_the_test_server_enjoying_the_new_changes/,"So i have been playing the test servers for a day or 2 now and it has been very enjoyable. So far i have played on my GWF. The GWF changes have been awesome. We are amazing offtanks now. I literally held (what felt like 20-30) adds during the Iceheart boss fights like it was nothing. I barely could find people to test T2 runs and finally made a group of 1 GF, 2 DC, 2 GWF. 1 Dc didn't even bother to slot astral shield because as he explained it, ""I want to see how well we do with only having 1 shield"". He seemed really excited to try out Castle Never when it goes live as our GF didn't have the GS to try it out in the test server.

Aggro management was awesome. The DC never got aggro after me or the GF took the initial aggro away. Overall it was a enjoyable run.

Now with the changes to GWF, i still use my old sentinel spec. Not so fast is really nice now, i had it on my bars for the majority of the dungeon. Come and get it is awesome. the reduce cool down can put it in rotation with not so fast, or IBS. I didn't have much chance to fiddle with roar, leap or any other moves that had lower cooldowns to see if it is worth using in a rotation as my encounters were Not so Fast, Come get it, IBS.  

The new Unstoppable changes are pretty awesome for PvE. I haven't had chance to PVP yet (which is what i do the majority of the time on my GWF on the live servers) but the extra HP from popping it with full determination is amazing. Our damage is pretty sweet,seeing how now we are able to grab a bunch of mobs and just mow them down.  I was the top DPS of our group (about 2mil higher then our other gwf) and i can imagine id be up there with a cw or a tr with good rotations

My test server experience has been good. Im looking to see if anyone from the Mindflayer server would like to test out T2 or even T1 dungeons. I have a CW who is geared to do T2, and i have a TR who isnt geared to do T1 yet but i can probably get some AH items to get there.  i really want to test out the ""nerfs"" these classes received and try to see if im going to need new rotations or a new spec.

We're not 60 yet, but I read comments that AD is easy to get once you're at 60 and running T2 dungeons.

However, at the same time, I see comments saying that T2 dungeons are impossible to complete without guilds. 

So, does that mean that if you're not in a guild, AD will still be difficult to get, just like how it was before 60? We're doing the professions, dailies, etc, but at the current zen prices (~300 AD/zen) it's going to take us a month of ""routines"" for a full respec. That's just ridiculous.

We're by no means bad players (probably average... we had experience raiding competitively in WoW), but trying to get into guilds and then manage the social interactions are not something we're keen on getting into.

So, is there a way to gather AD at 60 at a pace that is decent without going into T2? I don't need 5-6m AD a week.

I just started playing NW because I've been looking for an MMO to really fill the void. Anywho, I've started playing and I'm seriously loving it.

Is there anyone who would mind helping me? I just have a few questions, hopefully this isn't against the rules, I just didn't know where else to post.

1. What is the Foundry? I see/hear a lot about it on /r/Nw, from my understanding they are user made maps that people make and you can play. How do you play them and where can you find them?

2. What's the most efficient way to level in this game? I'm 13 at the moment and just playing PvP since it's my favorite thing to do in MMOs but it seems rather slow. Should I stick to doing the storyline? On that note, where do you spend the Glory PvP currency?

~~3. Is there a way to que PvP/Foundry etc without having to go to the billboards/NPC? If so I seriously can't find it I looked and googled everywhere.~~
Figured out how to do this.

4. This is the most confusing one. I can't find any good resources for Rogues online anywhere. What do I max? What stats do I put points into? What feats do I get? What abilities are good? Believe it or not I can't find anything for this on google what so ever.

5. What do all the acronyms mean? CW, T2, and so on.

1367762619.0,11,self.Neverwinter,1dqbzr,Am I the only one who thinks there is lack of balance in PVP?,Zanarchy,19,8,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dqbzr/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_there_is_lack_of/,"As a Great Weapon Fighter, PVP is pretty much impossible if the enemy team has a Control Wizard, they seem to be the most overpowered class because they can teleport (dodge) three times (more than any class) meaning they get safely away from you with ease, this means when I get past all of their CC, they can just teleport away and CC me again, there is nothing I can do against them, I suppose I could use my Determination but it only lasts a few seconds and I get about one run of my combo before it runs out in which they repeat all over again, they're just extremely silly and tedious to fight against, it isn't fun and it wouldn't be much of an issue if we had a dodge, but we don't, we have a sprint that doesn't dodge which is just stupid, it's the dodge without the damage reduction, I'd say it's good at chasing down enemies but it really isn't, you move at the same speed so you get two hits in before they get out of reach.

Clerics seem to be too good at healing and dishing out damage so much so that if there are two clerics on one team, you're going to have trouble even scraping them whilst they whittle your HP down because they just heal up whatever you damage them with, or so it has been in my experience anyway.

Guardian Fighters are kind of in the middle, fighting a Guardian is easy considering they don't dish out as much damage as every other class but holy hell, should they have that much block? It takes around 10 seconds of a full team hitting them to get that block down, trying to solo a Guardian Fighter is a lost battle because they can attack you whilst they are blocking, you can attack them from behind but whilst their team is backing him up, there's no way to do that unless you want to die.

Trickster Rogues are fine, apart from the 4 second daze they seem to have up every 10 seconds, they already do enough damage, why should they have a daze that lasts for 4 seconds whilst I get a two-second daze maybe? They have the advantage of cloaking so it's not as if it's hard for them to get extra attacks off on people, apart from them I don't really have an issue, they deal a lot of damage but they are squishy so it's fine.

I can't really comment on how balanced or unbalanced Great Weapon Fighter is as I've hardly ever fought one, it seems as if we're weak but that may just be me trying to justify my lack of skills at them, however I would like to hear if you guys think they are OP, UP or perfectly fine.

Another thing I don't really like about PVP is mounts, I think the maps are way too small for them to have much of a purpose, I've had teams of people that just mount up, run to a point, cap the point, run to another point, cap that etc... etc..., I suppose they're good for getting back to the battle but because each control point gives +300 leaderboard points, people just go after them leaving the rest of their team to fight a 4v5, perhaps in bigger maps I could see them having a purpose but for the ones we have now, I don't think they're a good fit.

I'm not saying that any of this is fact, I'm just saying that this is what I've thought when going against these certain classes in PVP, I'd like to hear what you guys think :)",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_1dqbzr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dqbzr/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_there_is_lack_of/,

Within minutes of being logged into this game every fan speeds up to turbo and it sounds like its going to explode. I don't understand. I can minimize it and they'll all slow down to normal. Bring it back up and you instantly hear them kick into overdrive. 

Is it optimization issues or what?

Edit: This post isn't about frame rate. I don't have any frame rate issues. It stays solid whether I'm in a solo instance or the conclave. Its about being the only game that causes every fan to speed up to max. 

Edit #2: FIXED: On a hunch, I got home and reverted back to the current release nVidia drivers, rebooted and started up the game. Fans all run normal. I guess it had to be something in the NW beta drivers. So it was kinda my bad, but if anyone else if having issues, try going back to the pre-nw beta drivers.

Also, I don't usually feel the need to be for conflict but hoooooly crap there was some reallllly shitty feedback here. 

#1: The AMD 965 BE was pretty much the standard gaming chip a couple years back. No I'm not going to rock Crysis 3 max, but it's still a very solid chip and this game is certainly not next gen. I just really don't understand how anyone can seriously think this game is more demanding than anything else I'd said I was running.

#2: A GTX 660 2gb to run this on max? What? No really... what?

#3: ""The simple answer here is the obvious one. You're clearly not a very knowledgeable computer user for a few reasons, but basically it's because your computer isn't powerful enough to run it easily at max settings."" Eh, you're just a dick. This PC is fine to run on max. I'm running it right now on max, alt-tabbed typing this. It was a driver issue. I built this PC and every one I've owned for the last 15 years, I'd just forgotten I'd downloaded the beta drivers over the weekend and hadn't realized that could be the issue.

**First off is the combat**  

This game comes fairly close to having perfect combat,  it still feel a bit floaty though.  It is hard to describe.  The thing is that little bit of lock when your attacking is annoying and often it is difficult to break some skills.  It makes the combat at times feel jerky, it tends to only be certain skills that feel this way, mostly skills that have a large animation with multiple stages,  the biggest one for me was duelists fury.  I actually really like the idea and visual of the skill, but the long windup and lock in of the skill made me stop using it.

  I will say this the combat is still much more well done than guild wars 2 and is one of the best action combat systems I have played.  I love the skill system in that you have two main at will and 3 main skills.  It works really well and allows you to have fun and exciting combat without having to have hotbars clutter your screen.  Even though you only are using a few skills the combat is incredible deep.  You have a ton of different viable ways of building a character.  I decided on focusing on crits and my skill setup is completely different than someone who wants to stay in stealth for as much as possible.   You really have some great flexibility in this system.  

The combat is also very skill based.  At times I have been in groups where players die just because they are not very good at an action system.  Other times me and another person(2 rogues) duoed a dungeon boss because the rest of the team kept dieing and we got tired of rezzing them.    I think the skill level is also about perfect,  it ramps up fairly smoothly and while difficult is not something that would lock out a player who wants to learn the system.    

**Second the world and instancing**

I have to say the world is really well done graphically.  It looks great and feels like the setting.  There are a few downsides though,  I would like to see more flavor text on misc NPC's as they are way to silent and the repeating lines get really annoying really fast in areas if you stand around. I have to say I am really disliking the instancing,  I like how it is being used to tell the story, so I understand the need,  I just with it was a bit more seemless in some parts as you tend to zone a lot and even installed on an ssd the loading times for even small zones are decent enough that they break the flow.  I really wish we had more of an open overworld,  I never mind the dungeons being instanced,  its just the instancing of the main zones makes the world feel small and seem disjoined at times. Its hard to tell where the zones connect because they do not even feel like they do connect to a different area, they feel like their own little walled garden.      

**The questing and NPC's**


It does a great job of actually leading you on an adventure and story just like a good DM in a PnP.   You are usually focused on one task at a time which I really love, you do not grab 20 quests and go out and kill in an area til you finish them all like so many of the generic MMO's.  You have a single epic goal to accomplish that you are focused on,  it makes it feel like an adventure in forgotten realms  by that single point as your actually following a story.  This is something that I was actually amazed that they pulled off, even the dungeons are skirmishes are part of the story of the area you are following.  It works really well. 

The biggest thing they need to work on here is getting backstory down for all the people standing around.  It would really make the world come together as right now you just have a ton of people standing around, if they are not a quest npc you can not talk to them at all.  This really breaks immersion and they really need to work on this as it breaks the PnP and forgotten worlds feel when none of the people standing around have any backstory or even talk to you.

**Finally, the state of the game.**

 I was playing around trying to break things and I will say I found a few game breaking bugs,  It is entirely possible to get yourself trapped in an instance and be unable to leave without using a specific trick.  I have encountered a few crashes playing around.  I will say this,  they really need to increase the idle timer or remove it completely.  It is really rare for a game to have an idle timer that kicks you and getting kicked after only 15 minutes is fairly annoying.   Overall the game is fairly stable,  they have a few bugs to work out,  the performance is actually better than I would have thought and the world actually looks really great,  I do notice a pretty big performance hit in windowed mode compared to most games.  Graphically the game looks great and it has great performance,  You have quite a bit of tweakable options.

The voice chat is also really annoying, it really needs to default to push to talk as I have had to listen to people talk or hear them breathing all the time.  At times the voice chat is also very picky and the in game settings for it are hard to adjust as you can not hear yourself when setting it up.  If you are going to have a voice chat system it really need to work a bit better.  The volumes are off at times and it just is not pleasant to get set up right compared to something like mumble.   I really do love the idea of having it in the game though,  I loved the EQ2 voice chat in groups because you could go with random people and still talk naturally.   I really hope the kinks get worked out as it is really nice to see in a game.



**TLDR**
The game is looking really good so far despite the few negatives I had I am loving the game and it is looking like it will be a great game.    ",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1362816950.0,,,True,t3_19ynbs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/19ynbs/the_good_the_bad_and_the_great/,

Does anyone actually complete dungeons in this game without cheese-dicking their way through with every shortcut, bug, and exploit they can find? Seriously, it's getting ridiculous. About half the time that I queue up for DD (assuming the tank and cleric don't decline the invitation, which happens approximately 85% of the time), we end up with at least one party member who wants to spend 10-20 minutes searching for just the right place to jump to avoid a few mobs, or they want to bug the boss/adds, or take advantage of some exploit that lets you reset the boss and kill him repeatedly.

I understand that not every mob in every dungeon has to be killed. I know that there are intentional shortcuts in some dungeons, including Castle Never. But seriously: if your ""shortcut"" involves training half the dungeon so that *maybe* a few party members can push through to the next campfire before dying, or pushing all the mobs into a pit where they'll respawn and cause no end of grief to anyone who dies and has to run back to the party, **stop doing that shit.** It would be easier to just kill the mobs and proceed through the dungeon.

inb4 *""but it's faster""* - No it isn't; the first time someone dies and has to contend with respawned mobs, or some newbie can't find the exact right hidden pixel to jump on, or someone forgets to dismiss their pet before jumping through some obscure crack in the wall, you've basically lost any time advantage.

inb4 *""but the dungeons are too hard otherwise""* - No they aren't, you're just so used to cheese-dicking that you need to learn how to play the right way.

inb4 *""hurr, but we get lots more lewts by using this exploit""* - Kill yourself. 

Ok, now that I've got that off my chest, are any non-zerging, non-exploiting guilds recruiting? I'd like to do T2s, GG, and CN on a fairly regular basis. I don't care about PvP even a little.

**Foreword**

Last time we started the series with [Comparison of leadership and crafting in terms of profit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1giarr/time_equals_ad_calculations_why_leadership_is/) There was some serious discussion and really good points thrown out. This time I'm back with a less controversial topic, a guide on optimal leveling of mailsmithing, platesmithing, tailoring and leatherworking.

For those who haven't read the last part, in Neverwinter I'm Joakim XIV of MOPP4 in the Beholder server. I'm currently lvl 20 on every profession except leadership (lvl 17 :/). I started playing about week after open beta came out, I have spend about 100$ on the game (Guardian founders pack and 5k zen) that I invested in the first set of tools and have since then made about 50mil crafting and farming (solo).

**Why level crafting**

Although the benefits should be easy to see, it's quite common question. The main reason why I think everyone should level at least their own profession are the reinforced tier 2 items. Currently you can reinforce tier 2 arms, but I bet later they will add more items to that list.

The second reason is profit. Even with current market the expected value per crafted epic pant/shirt is from +50k to +100k with 4 mithral tools depending on server. Since tools are about 800k per piece, and many of them can be used in two professions it doesn't take too long to start earning. Also tools don't seem to lose too much value, so basically you can sell them off losing only 10% on your initial investment.

**Notes about the guide spreadsheet**

Some of you might remember this from earlier, this has long been a ""work in progress"". The current version has 3 different paths, there is one more where you would create only white pants and shirts from your own materials. I did not bother with it, since residuum is so cheap these days, if someone really needs it, I take requests.

Fine, here is your link http://goo.gl/KVZPc

Personally I found the entire experience to be underwhelming because of some simple obvious things that I would like to see changed.

1.  PVE is way too easy for the amount of people in it.  Should there be trash mobs that are easy to clear for undergeared players?  Sure.  But there should also be epic level dragon type monsters that a group can take down for a higher count of drops.  Farming trash isn't that fun to be honest.

2.  PVP is too zergy.  Adding casters that kick people off their horses, and monsters that never lose aggro, and respawn a lot would add another dimension to the fight.  Also releasing groups in 5 man bursts through separate gates would do some good in keeping the initial zerg force spread out.  

3.  It doesn't matter how good you do, so why do it?  Last night we won 3500 to 1000, and still got stuck into a T1.  I was told that your performance doesn't matter, it is the servers performance in the event.  This is madness.  As we ran through on autopilot in the T1 our whole group was wondering why the hell we even bothered to try.  Why bother other than to make a jump macro and hop every 5 seconds in pve, and see what random dungeon you end up in?  We fought really hard, and played very hard, and did very well.  Someone we weren't grouped with, were not guilded with, did not know, and could not control apparently was a botter, or just awful in their pvp in a completely different instance.  If a group wins its 20v20 pvp they should get to go into the t2.  Socialism isn't fun in video games since the results are felt as just arbitrary, you can debate it's merits in real life elsewhere.

What we had all hoped (in my guild at least) was this was going to be an amazing guild function where guilds or alliances would be able to field 20 people into pvp, and 20 people into pve, and test our personal mettle, not the mettle of the collective hive.

GWF dps have been buffed and it shows on the damage dealt. Both GWF in the two runs had the highest damage dealt before the boss. After boss is down, the rogue damage and GWF is very close.

I dont know if it's the same if you get kicked by the leader.

You aren't able to leave the party too, you have to be kicked by the leader. Relogging doesnt help in this case.


Hope this is fixed soon..

Edit :
Good point from vmlinux, please just do something else than queue again before the game ends.
I didnt thought about that, because i am pvp only player :-)

PvE: If you do not get the teleport when queuing for dungeons, log out and back in. There will be a button that appears at the top of your screen labeled ""Return to Instance"" Clicking this should teleport you to the instance. If this does not work. Change map instances and then relog again. ***Note - This does not work 100% of the time. I have gotten around a 90% success rate though***

PvP: Queued for PvP and it didn't teleport you? Can't quit party and party leader won't kick you? Change instances and leave party. It's as simple as that.

Neverwinter has been in Open Beta (I call it actually released) but lets take a close look at some things

1. Raids have been announced but not yet released. (chances are the gear obtained here will make the gear obtained ""less than honorably"" from T2's not matter so much)

2. Drow's have not been released. Come on... Everyone wants to play Drizzt. That is why they are holding them back 

3. follow up to second...Rangers and warlocks have been leaked again everyone wants to play Drizzt. 

4. Everyone has 2 Paragon paths that are still locked. We don't even know what all the classes play like. Imagine if we were all playing wow and every warlock was only Demonology or every Rogue was Sub. The game would totally change when they opened the other talent trees. 

5. You CAN actually play for free. Sure if you want to get everything out of the game you need to pay money. But you can get a mount for 5g (that is slow, but the maps are small). You don't NEED to min/max your powers/feats and you can just play around. People complain about only getting 2 character slots but you can make multiple accounts for free

6. FOUNDRY! You want to make Astral Diamonds? Make a good Foundry Map and keep supporting it. I have had people tell me they make TONS from their foundry map in tips. Sure it takes a TON of time and is a LOT of work but they had fun with it and it is literally free money. It is something totally unique that no other game has done before. 

7. If you do want to MIN/MAX lets you need to spend your $40ish to get your character set up...then probably $20ish a month on respecs BUT there is a cool thing. In wow you had a sub, it came out of your bank account each month right? In this game you can farm astral diamonds OR pay for it out of pocket. At least you get the option. And lets not forget you are the one CHOOSING to play hardcore. You are the one choosing to want to get every little bit out of EVERY LITTLE THING

At the end of the day....I think the most important thing we do is give this game more than 2 weeks before we cast it into the volcano. Stop blowing hundreds of dollars (because I assure you the next tier will make all this gear useless) and farm your own gear. Instead of trying to min/max your spec learn to play your character and EXPLORE!

I've been playing it ever since

Before I thought posting here was a consideration, I found myself writing down the reasons why I was having fun. I made a list:

- Intuitive. Everything about this game feels very fluid, very intuitive. The way my abilities worked on their own and together, the key bindings, the minimalist UI, adventuring...

- Baldurs Gates meets GW2. Game-world unlike any other I've experienced in an mmo- the feel of a Baldurs Gate/ Demon Souls, but multiplayer in every aspect. The questing zones are intuitive and encourage multiplayer play, but it's up to the player to group with others. The classes fill unique enough roles for grouping to be a pleasant, more filling experience.

- Storytelling- The dialogue cinematics were not cringed at. In fact, I looked forward to them. Having my last mmo being gw2, not having a voice assigned to my character felt freeing. I struggled connecting with my Norn Necromancer because his voice/ character he was shoed in was just ridiculous.

- Complete immersion. If you appreciate sound, soundscapes, you'll find yourself welcoming the immersion created by their impact. The game world feels genuine and alive. This blends well with a unique refreshing mechanic- HP doesn't naturally regenerate. And when your HP gets low, your screen gets darker as the sounds around you are deafened by a thumping heartbeat. Campfires found at the scarcely located safe zones changes this. While your character replenishes his health with each pulse of warm campfire ambiance you notice a sense of calm- the music is soft, the conversation around you muffled and chill, and the fire crackles throughout it all- all this detail went into the sound alone. To heightened this effect, the moment you step outside of your campfire, the music gets tense, the color palette gets dark around you, and the sound effects get straight up creepy. This game is amazingly atmospheric, which I really appreciate since it's a D&amp;D title.

TL;DR Totally surprised by Neverwinter. Journaled my immediate reflections and thought this subreddit may be interested.

I am fairly new to Neverwinter, but i have allready made myself some thoughts. I started playing a few days before the Foundry ""nerf"".
I really grew to like the maps people made, both the story and the gauntlet type ""grinds"".

I do agree that the exp gain from the exploited foundry maps were over the top, but i do not think that the rest were. 

The reason i want to use the Foundry instead of questing, is that i actually like grinding mindlessly, as that is how i relax, and get away from day to day stuff.

Well, when i logged on yesterday there was a patch, and the notes simply stated that the foundry exp had been tweaked, my first thought was of course that they lowered the exp. But i was in for a surprise. The first half of my foundry gave exp/loot as usual, and then it suddenly stopped giving anything at all.

I now have no clue as to why, but if i re-enter a new foundry it will give exp again. But i find it stupid to leave / join foundries every time i stop getting exp. This kind of takes away from the ""idea"" of playing through other players maps.

I find the ""fix"" they made to be very inconvenient, both for us mindless grinders, but also for the map creators. I cannot comprehend why they did'nt turn the exp down, instead of turning it on/off during a Foundry, that just seems stupid to me.

Well, i know this is a topic that have been discussed alot, but i wanted to throw my point of view out there aswell.

I have basically no CC right now, so I find that a pack of mobs is up in my face really quickly, and I'm constantly teleporting around trying to get some hits on them as they're all up in my shit. This class right now seems to either give two options, either stand in melee and get your face eaten, or do a shitty attempt at kiting and barely getting any hits in due to being unable to cast for a second afterwards. It feels kind of silly just porting around the room and trying not to get killed. As soon as I stop to try and cast, BAM, the mobs are there and I'm popping health pots.


Anyway, maybe I just suck, but I'm wondering if there's anyone else who's run into these problems as a low-level CW, or maybe someone might have some advice. I'd like to hear from some higher levels about how they're finding the CW solo combat.

But instead we have warping around and a very rogueish type action (the magic missiles cast animation looks very much like throwing knives animation), which to me does not go with the whole wizard type. To me, playing a wizard usually means playing a more elder and a slower person. 

I know this is a small gripe and probably not something others will agree upon (there are young wizards as well). It's just that with small adjustments the wizard could be made to look more like a traditional wizard. Instead of making the teleport move look like a dodge, it could have had animation that makes it look like the wizard never actually moved anywhere.

1363034553.0,10,self.Neverwinter,1a3p9k,The Pay-To-Win argument is getting old.,Lawlta,33,23,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1a3p9k/the_paytowin_argument_is_getting_old/,"Anytime someone posts a review of the game, there is always a post that consists of ""pay to win ruins this game"" at some point in time.  It's the biggest argument I've seen against the game, and it's getting a little old.

Minor background info:  I'm a broke ass college student, I don't have cash rolling in to spend on games.

The game is there for enjoyment, obviously.  It is also provided by a business that wants to be able to turn a profit by producing the game.  

* You don't want to pay $60 like you normally would for a game on release?  Awesome, you don't have to.

* You don't want to pay a monthly subscription?  Awesome you don't have to.

* You don't want to have to pay at all, in order to play every aspect of the game?  Awesome, you don't have to.

* You want to bitch and complain that you don't get certain things right away, all of which are earnable, for a game you didn't pay a cent for, and don't understand how basic economic stability of a company works?  Go ahead, but you're just going to be frustrated while wallowing in your own ignorance.

In games like SWTOR when they switched to the F2P model, they require payment (from my understanding) for action bars, being able to go into PvP more than a couple times, and other things.  If you don't want to, you're limited on what you can do, and can only play so much depending on what interests you.

The big complaint that I see people forming is one based off of ignorance and entitlement.  The game can't keep updating and releasing new content, as well as decent maintenance, without a revenue stream.  So if you are hardcore, and want to play through everything without a dime, that's fine.  You'll have to farm the gear and stuff yourself, which is awesome.

People are getting caught up in the fact that SOMEONE ELSE might pay this company money in order to buy currency, so they can buy gear to skip farming/content.  Really?  That's your concern?  World of Warcraft has had that problem with gold farmers since release.  It was a problem in Diablo 2, just being able to buy weapons from third party sites.  Blizzard got wise and said ""fuck it, if someone is going to provide this service, we might as well cut out the middle man, and legitimize it.""  Hell, they allow their own players to make money off of it.

Some other arguments I've seen are ""MOBAs have a good business model that doesn't affect gameplay"", which is total bullshit.  Here is the League of Legends example:

1.  Players have the ability to buy experience boosts to get to level 30 faster.  They are skipping learning the game, and tend to be the worst people to play with because they have no skill.

2.  You can buy IP boosts so you can earn runes faster, instead of spending time to earn them.

3.  You can buy champions if you don't have the earned currency, which now costs more the first two weeks.

The above example sounds identical to what is going in this game, except for the fact that there is an auction house.  It won't affect your gameplay, it won't require you to pay to enjoy the game.

If someone wants to buy their way through a game, and not actually put any skill forth or experience the game, I say let them.  They are the ones truly missing out on an experience.  However, if you want to pay for something that will reduce a grind, while you have been playing a game they spent a shit ton of time on FOR FREE, then I think that should be an option.

If you are so worried with the SOMEONE ELSE might get an advantage, then you need to step back and look at why that bothers you.  I don't care if someone buys the level 60 BoE dragon armor of expensiveness, and stands in town because he has no reason to do any dungeons or anything.  I'm going to play the game because it's fun, and I might toss them some money here and there to reduce some grind, buy some skin, or improve the enjoyment of the game through some minor facet.

I don't care to hear any arguments, I know people in the industry that work with these models and know the reasoning behind them.  With this system paying isn't the only way to enjoy the game 100%, which is good on them.

Somehow I keep thinking there must be SOMETHING in the game that will disappoint me.
In particular, I have two questions that may decide for me whether or not to invest money in this title. Sadly, I haven't gotten the chance to check for myself, and the topic is very subjective.

**Does the world feel epic? Does the game feel important?**

Excuse my use of the word 'epic', but I think it actually fits here. What I mean is, does the outdoors of Faerun really feel large, open, real? One thing I liked the most about WoW was just wander around and feel *out there*, you know? Some say Neverwinter so far is too heavily instanced, what do you think?

Secondly, does the setting and the quests, dialogue etc. convey the story in a way that makes what you do as a character feel important? Does the plot progression and your actions in it feel significant? I understand that there won't be different factions for the players, so I'm afraid it will just feel a little... bland. Is it ""ye ye I guess I'll go whack some monsters... whatevs"" or is more like ""Oh god I'm so excited to take down this boss, because so much depends on it!"".

I would really appreciate if some of you insiders took the time to help me out with these questions.

&gt;Not much is known about Mastefino, other than his small house he holds in the corner of the Enclave.

I'll tell you a bit about my Foundry quest so you can decide if it is worth your time!

1. **Server :** Dragon server; however, I am unsure if The Lost Boy is available to other servers in the Foundry.

1. **Stage :** The Lost Boy has proceeded through the REVIEW foundry stage! It is now in the NEW column, and can be found simply by searching for ""The Lost Boy""

1. **What to expect? :** Expect a quest that takes you through multiple zones that have been customized to fit the quest line. I have taken great care in the design and have placed a lot of work into the dungeon to make it a memorable experience.

1. **Dialogue :** There are no 'fail' dialogue responses; so those of you who wish may skip the dialogue (of which there are  four instances of).

1. **Limitations :** The quest has been painstakingly reviewed and tested by characters ranging from level 5 to 56, and the dungeon has been re-balanced and tweaked over a dozen times to try and bring an equal experience to all levels.

***Recommendations :***
 
**ALMOST TOO EASY :** 4-5 People (16-18 minutes)

**NORMAL NANCIES :** 3 People (20-22 minutes)

**HARD ROCKERS :** 2 People (23-25 minutes)

**PREPARE TO REVIVE :** 1 Crazy person (25-30 minutes)

The above information is based off of multiple play-tests by level 40s and above.

Namely, is there any *more* to this game?

To show you what I mean, I'll describe my experience: I would do an instance/mission/quest, get some exp, get a weapon that made my attacks a bit stronger, but wasn't really noticeable, and some armor that made me tankier, but also wasn't noticeable. Eventually I'd level up, after a few of those, I'd get a new ability, but it didn't really matter. They would always 1 shot people pretty much, regardless of which I used. If not, I'd just left click them to death. I'd repeat this, over and over with my friends. Get some levels, new weapons, etc.

It never got hard, does it get hard later? At one point me and friend got stuck in a bug (it's a beta, I understand), so we thought to try and fix it, we'd kill ourselves. This took so long to do. It took maybe 2 minutes or more of people just hitting us for us to die, and one of them was one of the bigger, tougher guys too. It shouldn't really be that difficult to get yourself killed I don't think.

So is there anything else to look forward to in this game? The abilities are one thing, but they can only keep you going so much. Is there anything else?

Through all the character classes, the bard has always been my favorite, especially when you have the ability to build the character however you see fit. Giving the variations that Neverwinter offers for character creation from the dyes you use for your equipment to the stats you put into your class build, I'd love to be able to start playing a bard again.

Any chance that this could be added in an upcoming expansion?

at 7 Day mark, you cannot sell the Coffer of Wonderous Augmentation. However you can sell the rank 5 enchantment for 1500 AD, if you get the green ward thats an extra 4K AD. if you get the blue ward, its 110,000 AD. you may make 1,200 AD if you sell the rank 4 enchantments.

If you go for the 7 day reward, you get minimum 785 AD per day, best 15K AD per day.

Nope. Second Rinehound now. Suddenly and frustratingly. Sacrificed myself to it. Not going through that again. So while I haven't abandoned the quest yet, I probably will when I next logon.

1368339013.0,8,self.Neverwinter,1e66zl,Upcoming classes based on D&amp;D 4th edition.,overgun77,9,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e66zl/upcoming_classes_based_on_dd_4th_edition/,"Playing NWO got me interested in 4e of D&amp;D. I haven't played a game yet, but I got the book and checking the classes I got a good overall idea of the possible upcoming classes and races, if I'm wrong in something please point it out!:

**Races**

* Dragonborn: Basically humanoid dragons favoring martial classes. Strenght and Charisma are their favored stats. Their racials might include a dragonbreath encounter attack, a healing passive and a damage boost passive.
* Eladrin: They live in the Feywild, crossing to the world for adventure.  Very elvish looking. Proficient in both, magic and fighting. Dexterity and Intelligence being their favored stats.

**Upcoming Classes and Paragon Paths**

In D&amp;D 4e, there is actually no distinctions on the available powers between builds, for example, a GWF has access to all the powers of a GF, so it's hard to determine which skills will be assigned to the upcoming classes, also, the classes share the same features, for example a GWF and GF both have the same class features, so how the classes will be implemented (if they are ever implemented) might differ on the list. I will list the base class and the available builds as well as the available Paragon paths for the base classes, but omitting the ones that are already implemented.

**Cleric**

* Battle Cleric: Favoring strength and going straight in the frontline.
 Some of the at-wills favored by this build are: *Priest's Shield*: Each attack puts up a defensive prayer upon you. And *Righteous Brand*: With your hit, you put a symbol on your target, buffing all damge done to that target. I think the War Cleric will be providing a lot of utility to a party, while keeping strong capabilities of healing. The role they might fulfill is that of a Leader/Striker.

Paragon Paths:

*Angelic Avenger*: AoE DMG and utility.

*Radiant Servant*: Fire based spells and powerful healing.

*Warpriest*: Party buffs casted as you attack.

**Fighter**

Paragon Paths:

*Kensei*: Nimble warrior with strong defensive and offensive abilities with a strong focus on the weapon.

*Pit Fighter*: Ultimate 1-on-1 fighting skills, lots of control on the fight.


**Paladin**: A Defender, not as offensive as the GF. Strong group utility. Probably an Hybrid between Defender and Leader. Favored stats: Str, Cha, Wis

* Avenging Paladin: The GWF of the Fighter class. Using two handed weapon with offensive skills and debuffing the adversary. Smiting non-believers to death.
* Protecting Paladin: Shield and Sword/Mace/Axe. Hits imbues the holiness upon your enemies. Skills damages enemies and buffs your allies at the same time

Paragon paths:

*Astral Weapon*: DPS path, bringing a lot of buffs with you attacks.

*Champion of Order*: Bring divine judgement to the wicked. Weapon shines in the presence of evil creatures. Offensive Tank path.

*Hospitaler*: Party buffs and utility.

*Justiciar*: Tank utility, taunt enemies, keep aggro. Defensive Tank path.

**Ranger**

* Archer Ranger: The Archer class. nuff said.
* Two-weapon Ranger: Dual wielding melee class. Very nimble with abilities to avoid damage.

Paragon Paths:

*Battlefield Archer*: Become one with the bow, tons of buffs to bow damage. The marksman path.

*Beast Stalker*: Use companion and summoned beast to aid in the fight. Bring some party utility.

*Pathfinder*: This is for two-weapon rangers. Scouts, nimble warriors, fast striking, lots of mechanics to avoid damage.

*Stormwarden*: Full out offensive of two-weapon ranger with lots of unrelenting attacks while using two weapons.

**Rogue**

* Brawny Rogue: This is more focused on head on combat, lots of control on the fight with stuns and knock downs. Very Strong attacks.

Paragon Paths:

*Cat Burglar*: Lots of mobility and avoiding damage.

*Daggermaster*: Critical attacks, backstabs, preparing attacks.

*Shadow Assassin*: Counter attacks, single attacks that heavily hinder enemies

**Warlock**
This is the offensive casting class. This one fills the role of a Striker, while the Wizard fills the role of a Controller. The description of the class is very interesting, you should take a look on the book if you can get a hands on it, I won't do it justice on this post. They favor both, melee and ranged attack.

* Deceptive Warlock: AoE debuffers, DoTs
* Scourge Warlock: Head on destruction.
Paragon paths:

*Doomsayer*: Description: ""You wrap yourself in the fear of the darkness beyond the stars and use it as a shield against your enemies. In Addition you examine the strands of fate to issue proclamations of doom to all who stand against you"" This is the definition of badassery. Strong debuffing, cursing and control capabilities.

*Feytouched*: Summoning. Bend the will of your enemies.
*Life-stealer*: Self explanatory? :)

**Warlord**
This is a Leader. Healing damage and providing buffs and other sorts of utility to the party. Melee character.

* Inspiring Warlord: Buff up party, healing, shielding damage, cure conditions/debuffs.

* Tactical Warlord: Offensive buffs, movement buffs, damage increase buffs, more power, control the battlefield with knockdowns.

Paragon Paths:

*Battle Captain*: Tactical Warlod in steroids.

*Combat Veteran*: Brings some offensive capabilities to the warlord.

*Knight Commander*: Brings some defensive capabilities to the warlord, debuffing the enemies around the party.

*Sword Marshal*: Brings additional offensive buffs to the party and some damage capabilities.

**Wizard**

* War Wizard: Damge dealer, specializing on AoE damage. Fire, Ice Lighting all the flashy and cool stuff.

Paragon Paths:

*Battle Mage*: Brings upclose spells and damage capabilities.

*Blood Mage*: Use own blood to cast powerful spells and buff up damage

*Wizard of the Spiral Tower*: Has the ability to use a sword and channel arcane magic through the sword. Sounds very intriguing.

So ive been lvl 60 for couple of days now ,with my GWF, ive farmed enough gear (in random grps mostly) to get to 9400 GS ,only to see that GWF is totally useless and so not wanted in the high tier dungeons. Whenever i check the zone chat for somone looking for a gwf, for t2 runs ,i never read ""grp looking for gwf"" ,or when they say "" grp lf DPS"" and i send them, im getting laughed at.

 The thing is, most t2 endboss mechanics consists of either DPSing them hard, while pushing their adds over an edge , or just ignoring the adds , OR whats sadly the bigger issue , exploiting bugs/glitches 
(9200GS dungeon, Pirateking,Spellplague,Dragon(t1)). 

In both cases you´re better off with an TR and 2 CW, instead of a CW/GWF. Melee AOE dps isng needed for anything in this game, except maybe clearing trash mobs faster.
 I know some of you do t2 dungeons with GWF, but i bet you either have premade/guildgrp, or just got lucky, and had a random grp that didnt know how bad GWF is for t2 :/ 

I wish i could do pirateking exploiting and farm seals, i wish i could finish spellplague dungeon, and i wish ppl would take me to the lair of the dragon, so i can at least beat him once .But whenever i login,i end up running cloak tower ,since ppl dont mind GWF there.

Out of every class ,the GWF peaked my interest, and ofc i end up with the  least needed class in this game :(

I didn't hear much about Neverwinter until a week ago, but on the back of some good reviews, and the fact I haven't played an MMO in a while, I decided to give it a shot, and I currently have a 25 Cleric and 20 Wizard. So far I've been pleasantly surprised, but the part that has most interested me is the potential of the Foundry.

Most of the Foundry quests I've done so far seem to be fairly simple, having the formula ""Go to A, kill B, read C, repeat until finished"". Occasionally there's a twist in there somewhere, or a tough to find clue, but most of the time that's the pattern. And while that's fine for quick Exp + Diamonds from the daily, it doesn't interest me so much.

What I'm really interested in making is more complex quests and campaigns that really reward those who spend the time to find small clues. Quests that force you to decide between factions, that have multiple endings depending on the choice you make and/or clues you find, campaigns where you have multiple paths and choices you make send you down a different series of quests in the campaign. Also, quests which have different qualities of ending - if you manage to find those crucial pieces of evidence and piece together what happened, you get the ""better"" ending which unwraps the conspiracy; but if you don't you're just thanked for your service. The gear reward is the same; the story reward is different.

So what I suppose I'm asking is how many of those things are possible, and how would I find advice on doing them. I'm sure I'll spend a fair bit of time at the creation kit trying to work this stuff out, but I'd also like to avoid re-inventing the wheel if possible. I'd prefer only links to more advanced Foundry techniques - the simple stuff is not only simple by nature (thus easy to figure out), but also there will be plenty of resources to give tips on it - but all advice appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_1e26jm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1e26jm/how_robust_is_the_foundry_creation_kit_and_whats/,

I had thought that it was a full revamp of the Neverwinter Nights series (which I enjoyed) but would be heavily instanced along the same lines as the predecessor of its main IP: Dungeons and Dragons Online (DDO). I have nothing against ""Collective Lobby MMOs"" as I like to call them, but I would rather play an open world MMO any day of the week. So as details started to emerge about Cryptic Studio's Neverwinter I didn't really pay much attention. The first I started hearing about it was over at Tipa's blog and some of her posts on G+. As of last week my free ""MMO time"" was spent playing Defiance and still dabbling in GW2's Super Fun Time zones and content. I spent probably 5-10 hours playing over the course of the last few days in Neverwinter (NW) and I am really enjoying the game. I am a serial game hopper, so I don't know how much longer that enjoyment will last but overall I have been pretty impressed with the game from an MMO mechanics discussion point of view. I also am fairly impressed about how low on my radar this game was for so much content being delivered at launch. My pros and cons list has been filling up as I play, so here are my thoughts:

**Pros: F2P Implementation - Its not F2P vs P2P - (Hint: It’s both)**

Free To Play (F2P) and Pay to Win (P2W)... To most it sounds as though it is the same thing - but in my world they are not - there is a subtle distinction. I consider F2P as a decent game without a monthly sub that continues to exist by selling items to players and/or by manipulating in game currency markets to its favor. P2W is the existence of the ability to purchase non- cosmetic enhancements to your game's entity that will give it a direct advantage.

Avg Joe Gamer can signup and play through a decent chunk of the content without paying for anything but the initial game. Neverwinter (NW) has gone one step further in not even requiring the initial game purchase. Solid F2P games always have a mechanic that allows the player to accomplish a task without purchase, and strive to create a purchase price for a task in line with a good time vs money ratio. I think the best example inside NW is the use of identification scrolls. They are fairly critical to the game and it is hard to get by without them. They are cheap to purchase (if needed) and in the early levels the drop frequency seems ""fair"" (purely subjective, I admit). There are many real world currency (RWC) purchasable ""adventure packs"" contain them if you really need more, or you can buy them directly (zen) or indirectly (astral diamonds). In short, if you need more identification scrolls and don't have time to farm them you can always purchase more with RWC. That is F2P in a nutshell, and I think NW has done a good job with implementing it. I like that NW has not gone the ""first X levels route"" with F2P (think Rift), which really is just proxy trial. While NW is limiting you to slots for different containers and mount types it does follow the normal ""holding back for cash"" mentality of F2P. I will touch on P2W in the cons section.

**Pro: Staggered Introduction**

One thing that I really like about the game’s introduction model is that certain features of the game are not used until level requirements are met at certain points. Auction House is ""introduced"" at lvl 10, companions around 15, mounts at 20, etc. It gives a good slow introduction to the game’s mechanics and gives you time to get used to each one for a slight bit until the next one is introduced. One interesting thing is that you also cannot utilize Zen (the RWC proxy) until level 10. I have been trying to figure out why this is. I would think as a biz they would want to accept RWC as soon as possible, however I think this may be a tool to slow down ""zen laundering"" assuming it is hard to move around purchasable items with low level characters. Regardless the reason it is an interesting decision and should be noted.

**Pro: Lore/World - SpellPlague**

I am a Dragonlance guy. By the time I was getting to college I believe I had read every dragonlance book available. I felt like it was almost like picking your favorite baseball team in picking the realm that you wanted to read from TSR/D&amp;D's worlds. You had the Forgotten Realms people, the Planescape people, the Greyhawk people, etc. I did dabble in Forgotten Realms a bit. I always enjoyed the Drizzt stories and Elminister always intrigued me, I played the Balder's Gates and TSR's Menzoberranzan, so if I had to choose a secondary TSR world I think Forgotten Realms would be it. That being said I never read really far into any of the lore of Faerun. The [Spellplague storyline](http://community.wizards.com/gomeztoo/blog/2010/01/11/the_forgotten_realms_post-spellplague_timeline) is new to me and I like how they are implementing so far into the (main?) storyline of the game. I don't think they have done a great job in separating out and describing the different deities (maybe later in the game?) however the overall storyline and where it fits into the Forgotten Realms canon seems well done from an outside perspective. It is probably both a blessing and a curse to use such a deeply developed world.

**Pro: Foundry**

One of the best aspects of the game. If you had described it to me before the game’s release I would have just thought (oh look another player gen'd content store) and not thought anything of it (aka EQ2). There are three things that were well done about the Foundry: rewards, enticement and filtration.

I was amazed when I saw I was earning decent xp and loot from my first foundry mission. The rewards were in no way over the top, but the mission scaled well to my level and gave back decent rewards. I had come into the Foundry level because of a task given to me in the first series of tasks that take you to level 20, but I was happy to find that there was a calendarized bonus to my Foundry zone. I was also able to pick up a bit extra from doing the Foundry mission by also having a daily quest for it that is available to everyone.

Last, I was VERY impressed with the content of the actual Foundry mission itself. It was extremely well done and I picked it because it was advertised in the top of the Foundry mission list, as if hand chosen. Player generated content is awesome, however I feel like 90% is crap (subjective) content that I just don't care to do. If you have a method to bubble up that 10% of good stuff to the top so that I can grok it quickly to see if it is worth the little time that I have to play MMOs, then I will certainly check it out. NW has done this and done it well. I hope the ""rankings"" don't start to get swayed too much and go the way of the iOS app store where they are not really all that representative of the content. As players of this game I think we need make sure that we are leaving feedback to keep the system going in the right direction.

**Pro: Scheduled Content &amp; Bitesized Content**

As I mentioned above I was very impressed with the Foundry mission but there was an extra bonus that I received because of bonus time period. I like the way that during the course of my play time there is usually one or two bonus areas that are listed, it gives me a little bit of an extra nudge to try out some of the content types (pvp, skirmish, player generated, etc) that I normally would not try out. I also like the fact that some of these content types don't take too long to accomplish. The Foundry quest seem to have average times from 17-100+ mins, while the skirmishes seem to take around 20. I like the fact that the average times are posted and I know if I am going to have time to get that content in fully with my limited playtime. Some of the 100+ min Foundry missions may be skewed by only one or two players trying them and taking much longer than the normal player, so there should be a minimum before calculating that on Cryptic’s side.

**Neutral: Twitch Based Combat**

I am still at odds with the combat system inside NW. I like the twitch focusing, it is very reminiscent of TERA, and I feel like the fights mean a bit more and are much more involved (aka not button mashing). However unlike Terra I feel like for some reason in this game it is easy to mistarget. I am playing a rogue and there are some larger HP draining actions that I want to save for bigger targets as I sneak around. However a lot of times the enemies are bunched and it is hard for me to target exactly which I want to hit, or I think I have the right entity targeted but the action ends up going off on another. These are small quibbles I know but enough to keep me on the fence for the twitch combat for the time being. It may just be that I need to be slower in my setup. I may revisit this point after playing the game more.

**Neutral: Engine Seems very familiar**

I have not seen anything outright saying the Turbine's LOTRO engine was used in Neverwinter, but man it sure feels like it. This isn't a bad thing by any means I am a big fan of LOTRO and its beautiful - yet accessible - art style, that being said this game feel VERY similar, down to the font above people's heads. It looks like I am not the only one2 who has this thought also.

**Neutral: It's Too Easy**

As of thus far (level 20 Rogue) the game is extremely easy. I think I have had 2 places where I actually felt challenged playing solo and only 1 when I had my healing companion with me. I like a little bit of challenge, but with NW I can jump into a skirmish with 4 other players and pretty much guarantee none of us will go down (even without the holy trinity present) and that is before any of us break out our companions. I wish the game was a bit harder, especially the group based missions. I don't think that the Rogue is OP as of right now, but I can say that when paired with a healer, there really isn't much content at this level that would give us any hesitation. Maybe this changes closer to endgame, or the endgame moves to PvP which mitigates this somewhat.

**Neutral: P2P Mats**

Tradesmithing in NW seems to be very similar to Star Wars The Old Republic in which you essentially hire underlings to perform the skills which take a certain allotted amount of time. This system is used in Guild Wars 2 for guild missions and also somewhat for spell level research in Everquest 2. I actually like this version of tradeskilling and it also prompts the user to login every now and then to requeue different objectives to advance. It puts the onus on time rather than some type of twitch setup (think EQ2). So why did I not list this as a pro?

Materials.

I am still trying to confirm but it looks like some materials that are needed are completely Pay based. I don't dig this at all. All mats should be farmable. Instead of making the recipes available to all without paying it seems like Cryptic has determined that they would just allow other recipes (not pay) to be used which would in essence be slower. If true and they are unfarmable I don't like that strategy personally. I won't put it in the con column because I understand it, but still I don't like that aspect.

**Con: ""Open Beta"" WTF does that mean?**

As someone who had not been keeping up with this game, I almost avoided it completely because it seems to be advertised as ""Open Beta"". The key to this phrase is still the Beta moniker. I had no clue in looking at this game if my character was going to get wiped at some point in the future. Only after checking out the forums did I realized that ""Open Beta"" essentially meant the game was live, just with the condition that things may need more work. Maybe this is a term used commonly, but I had not heard of it used this way before.

**Con: So Many Currency Types**

Gold, Seal of Drake, Astral Diamonds, Zen, Ardent Coins, Celestial Coins, Rough Astral Diamonds, Tarmalune Bars, Glory, Seal of Lion, Many Arrows Insignias, Seal of Pegasus - on and on and on.

Way too confusing. If you are going to do this then there needs to be an in game listing of ALL currency types and what type of vendors and tiers use them and how they are acquired.

**Con: P2W (Epic Enchants at higher level?)**

So circling back to the above about Pay 2 Win vs Free 2 Play, I don't mind P2W honestly, as I have grown older and my MMO playtime has gotten to be a smaller window I understand and like the ability to use real world currency (RWC) in exchange for time doing tedious tasks. That being said I think it needs to scale well.

At this point I am not even near confirming the below, but it does give me hesitation in looking forward towards the end game:

*Armor/Weapon Enchantments are for specific slots in your weapon/chest and grant special effects. They come in shards and have a chance to drop from Epic Dungeon bosses. You must combine 4 shards to create a Lesser version of the Enchantment. However, the success chance of fusion is at a staggeringly low 1%. To compensate, they have very strong effects. An example would be the Thunderhead Enchantment. However, the real kicker here is that these ""Lesser"" versions may be fused again to gain a stronger version. Those may also be fused again to create the strongest version. Ultimately, the Greater Thunderhead Enchantment will have a 30% on crit to damage and stun foes. To create the strongest Enchantment possible, it will cost 160 dollars and 64 shards. Unlike companions, these can be used in PvP.*

Taken from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dry0g/neverwinters_f2p_model_what_you_need_to_know/).

If that is the case then I will be enjoying this game up until I am no longer competitive spending $15 a month (sub!) on items in this game. I don't know the drop rates of these things, so I can only speculate at this moment, but if this is true and how the endgame will work then I think I will have a lot of fun up until the end game with Neverwinter.

I have been playing D&amp;D for a very long time, and 3rd edition has always been my home. Forgotten Realms was where my most powerful and longest-lived character, the Grey Dwarf Saint Parda Silvermane, was born. 


That being said, I have never played 4th edition, because I read it all over, and decided it would make a better MMO than tabletop game. And suddenly, Neverwinter is in open beta. It's a really fun game, and i'm enjoying it immensely, but I think I am misunderstanding something. I assumed that the Great Weapon Fighter was the closest thing I was going to get to a Greataxe-wielding Barbarian, since they don't actively come out with classes in this game. They wear medium armor and have amazing damage when geared correctly.


My question is that I don't know how I should be playing this class. I understand it's a great melee class, but it seems like most of the GWF's abilities are AoE-based, meaning that they are not good single-target attackers, or at least that's my guess. Can they DO good ST damage? Can I spec my GWF in such a way that will allow Parda to deal out damage? Does the AoE damage equal out or at least match up to other people's damage? Or do I need to try and start all over with a different type of character?  


Any advice or thoughts on the topic would be greatly appreciated.

- On rails -- a very scripted storyline.  Love them, but I can get that in Dragon Age, Skyrim, Bioshock, etc. without griefers or grinding.
- Repetitive -- grinding mobs or tradeskills, repeating the same quests with new characters, etc.
- Scheduling -- Since a big attraction of MMOs is playing with friends, I spent a lot of time just trying to coordinate 3-hour evening blocks of instance/raid time with other friends, many of whom are constrained by their own family commitments.
- End-game or bust -- Many modern MMOs view the level climb as a prelude to serious raiding at level cap.
- Falling behind -- Unless we only played with each other, invariably friends with more time would level too far ahead, and friends with less time would fall behind, making it harder to group and enjoy content together.

Mind you, I loved NWN and NWN2, especially the adventure creation tools and the multiplayer -- I created a few quests myself to play with friends privately.

I get the sense that this MMO solves a lot of the problems I listed with the content creation.  I don't see anything in FAQs about playing with others at different levels, or end-game, or grouping.  The point of the original NWN was not to level, really, because you could download or create a crappy adventure and award yourself a bazillion XPs at any time.  The point was to simulate to some degree a tabletop experience where you didn't need a DM to run you through everything.

Is that right for this MMO?  From those of you who have tinkered with the beta, convince me please!

I remember seeing an ad somewhere about a new Neverwinter RPG and I got pretty excited. Then I heard it wasn't going to release (I think it had to do with part of Cryptic closing down? I can't remember), and it was acquired by Perfect World and it was going to be an MMO. whattheactualfuck.jpg. 

After raging for about a day and subsequently forgetting about it entirely, I came upon MMORPG.com and it was high on it's hype meter. I looked into it and to say the least I was blown away at how good it looks. It looks incredibly smooth and the combat, for once in an MMO, actually looks fun and engaging.

Really looking forward to playing this.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,True,t3_13wb5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/13wb5y/i_just_started_looking_into_this_game/,
