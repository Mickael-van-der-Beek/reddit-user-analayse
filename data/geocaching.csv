I also hope that if you asked a question that I gave a helpful answer. I'll still be active in the geocaching subreddit, so you'll probably see me commenting on things in here.

It has a bit of a reputation in our area as being something of a local legend. I followed the advice of the cache listing and brought a change of clothes, and set out to tackle this cache. 

We came up to ground zero, and already we know this is going to be a tough one. In front of us, we have a drainage ditch leading to a concrete culvert, all leading to essentially a well that the culvert led into, and another tunnel that led underground. Having some decent rains recently, the water level looked painfully high. A quick dip of a branch to find where the bottom was proved to put solid ground at roughly belly-button deep. ""Nothing more to it, but to do it,"" I said to myself, and started climbing down.

A few rungs down, the thought occurred to me that it might not be a bad idea to get rid of my shirt, as a cotton shirt soaked with swamp water did not sound like a good idea. So shirt comes off, and I lower myself into water that was far too cold to reasonably be sitting in.

A small eternity (which evidently turned out to be about three whole minutes of regular, non-freezing time) of frigid searching passes, and I get word from the top of the well to quiet down. Of all the possible muggles to cross our path, a member of the Sheriff's Department comes sauntering down the trail, with a prison work detail in tow. I sit tight, and my wife and buddy sit on the edge of the well, trying to look innocent.

The cop stops, looks, and thinks for a second. ""Evil?"" he asks, quite nonchalantly. The jig is up, and we are officially discovered. I climb up a bit, and wave a hand out of the top of the well. The cop laughs, as his brother, an avid cacher, had told him horror stories of this cache. The work crew, on the other hand, freaked out a bit, eliciting responses like ""What the hell? Was that a hand?"". Apparently, none of them were nearly as acquainted with the idea of geocaching. 

The group crowded about to see what we were doing, and the two cachers topside took a moment to explain what our sport was, fascinating the men huddled around the well, peering down. They even went on to offer tools to help me search where my hands would not reach.

Eventually, the work crew had to move on and get to work, and went along their way. We phoned a friend after quite a bit more searching, and eventually made the find. Changed clothes, and made a dozen more finds. Hell of a day.

**TL;DR: I spent my morning half naked, butt-deep in swamp water and surrounded by inmates, and got busted by a cop. And it was awesome.**",,False,,t5_2qyvl,1365548183.0,,,True,t3_1c0tml,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/1c0tml/it_took_me_666_finds_but_i_officially_have_an/,

If you put your logbook in a bag *inside* the box, that is fine.

But plastic bags only cause problems. Some mistakenly believe they help keep the cache dry. Nothing could be further from the truth: A plastic bag never seals tightly (even if you *do* seal it, it will quickly develop holes) so moisture reaches the cache. Instead of flowing away or evaporating, the water is now trapped close to the cache. This makes it much more likely that it will seep through even the tightest joint. If you want to keep your cache dry, choose a sturdy, watertight box and put some [silica gel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica_gel) or other desiccant in it.

In addition to this, plastic bags quickly turn into a tattered, sorry affair that looks terrible and gives caching a bad name. They can also fill up with debris and unpleasant stuff like dead insects or spiders.

Worse yet, these bags are a hazard to wildlife; as animals can choke on or get trapped by tattered plastic.

I went on a night cache with a group of four friends.  We all had headlamps, and one of the girls had the sense to bring some pepper spray.  We joked about it on the way there, but we were glad to have it in the end.

It wasn't a difficult trail to follow, and we made good time.  About a mile in (and slightly disoriented by the trees), we spy what we thought was one of the fire tacks that had fallen out of the tree into some bushes.  When one of our group went closer to check, we discovered it was a reflector on someone's shoes!  They were almost hidden by the bushes, but the reflector caught off our headlamps.

When it was announced that someone was under the bush, the person moved their feet so we couldn't see them (hence, we were able to assume that they were conscious, alive, and wanted to be left alone).  Since we had obviously disturbed them, we called out an apology.  After about 30 seconds of silence, we turned back.  The night cache was in a large public park (used mostly for Frisbee golf by day) in what we had considered to be a fairly safe suburban neighborhood, but finding creeps hiding in the bushes made the game MUCH less fun.

Walking back to our car, we heard something moving past us off the trail in the brush.  About 5 minutes later, a woman probably in her 30's, alone, dressed in all black, and with no flashlight light met us on the path walking the opposite direction.

Being a semi-nice person, I informed her that there was someone hanging out back there, and it was probably not the best idea to be out here alone.  The woman insisted that she was not alone, that she had friends behind her on the trail and to ""not let them scare you.""

Then she apparently jumped back into the brush, because she looped around and cut us off on the trail at least three more times!  Sometimes she would just be standing in the dark completely still in the trees.  I'm honestly not sure if we even noticed her every time.

Wanting nothing more than to avoid encountering her further, we left the park from the back side, which butted up against a Target parking lot, and called someone for a ride to the car.  We spotted what we assumed was her car hidden outside of the designated parking area on the way back to get ours.

My husband and I went the next weekend to finish the cache in the daytime.  We would have never seen them in the dark, but we discovered three different hidden tree stands along the cache trail!  She was watching us the entire time!",,False,,t5_2qyvl,False,,,True,t3_1kg3yr,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/1kg3yr/anyone_else_experienced_something_creepy_at_a/,

I was geocaching with a few friends yesterday.  We had done a few caches in local parks and still had about an hour of daylight and so decided to stop at one last quick grab which appeared to be just off of a side road.

Brief description of area: The side road connects some large student housing complexes to a sports bar and is perhaps about a third of a mile long.  Lots of cars park along this road for the sports bar; mine was a little distant from the others.  The cache appeared to be on the outskirts of a drainage basin - the type you often see near dense commercial and housing developments.

Anyway, we were rummaging around in the rocks and one of us turned to notice a police car had stopped about twenty yards from us, and two officers were stepping out.

""Hello,"" we called politely, ""We're geocaching!""
""Oh,"" said the first officer.  He seemed to recognize what geocaching was. ""That makes sense.  Say, who's car is this?""
""Mine,"" I said.
Officer: ""Can we see your ID, please?""
Me: ""Sure,"" pulling it out of my wallet.  The second officer maintained some distance, arms crossed, not speaking, body language not friendly.
As I gave the officer my ID, which I assumed he was going to just inspect on the spot, he then asked for the IDs of my two friends! We complied, and then the two officers retreated to the car to run our IDs!?!?!??!?!

So now we have to stand around by the car, looking and feeling like criminals, while the officers take five minutes to run our licenses for NO GOOD REASON, in my opinion.

The first officer stepped out and returned our IDs to us and asked if we were going to be doing any more caching.  ""No,"" I said. ""We're losing daylight pretty fast.""

""Well, we just wanted to make sure you weren't stranded or missing something,"" explained the first officer.  ""We just wanted to make a note that we talked to you.""

The officer never told us we did anything wrong, but they still sat there while I turned the car around to leave.

I have been geocaching for about 3 years, and over that time I have had a number of run-in's with suspicious people and police... I always use caution and leave if I think Ill look too sketchy, but it still happens occasionally.  If you're planning on doing any caching at night or in areas with a lot of ""muggles"" please PRINT OUT GEOCACHING BROCHURES.  There is a print friendly brochure on the website and it has saved me more than once:

http://www.geocaching.com/tools/default.aspx#Guide

Geocaching is a fairly unknown community (at least where I am from) and when you try to explain to a cop or even people passing by that you're looking for small, indiscriminate items hidden all over the place with gps coordinates, well, you can see how it may be taken.  Even when I present them with my gps, they aren't convinced I'm up to any good, but that official looking brochure always seems to put them at ease.  Before I had the brochures with me, I spent a half hour trying to persuade some officers that I am simply playing a game, only to be released and told not to come back again... but when I have that brochure with me, they become much friendlier and even interested.  One officer even joined me to look for an easy 1/1, and I let him find it on his own to show him it was harmless.  He actually ended up taking a few copies with him for himself and his station so that he could spread the word to others who may come across cachers in the future. 

So, thats my little rant and I know it doesnt apply to everyone, but if it saves a few people from trouble in the future it will be worth it!!",,False,,t5_2qyvl,False,,,True,t3_tqpe7,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/tqpe7/a_word_of_advice_to_new_geocachers/,

I'm in the process of creating an iPhone and Android app based on the idea of photo-caching. That is, users can place a cache simply by taking a photo in a cool place. Other users then collect points by trying to replicate that same picture at the same place. 

The idea is basically taking geocaching and making it entirely virtual. What do you think, would you play? The app would be entirely free!

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback guys! It looks like there's at least some interest in an app like this so I'll keep working on it. Maybe you guys can be my first alpha testing audience :). I'll keep you updated.

Dear Geocacher,

In our effort to inspire outdoor play through Geocaching, we are often faced with decisions about what to focus on next, and what to focus on less. It is through these decisions that we explore opportunities to grow the global game of Geocaching.

Occasionally, during this process, we are faced with the reality that certain ideas don't catch on as we had hoped. In these situations we owe it to ourselves and to you to make tough decisions about the future of every project and the resources to be applied to each. Sometimes, as a result, cool features must become casualties.

**In this spirit, we have decided to retire Geocaching Challenges.**

This means that, effective today, we have disabled the ability to create new Challenges. We have also removed the Challenges application from all mobile application stores. In approxim ately 7 days, we will be removing all traces of the Challenges functionality and related content from Geocaching.com.

On an office wall here at HQ is a sign that reads, ""Let's make better mistakes tomorrow."" By accepting that we will sometimes get it wrong, we can allow ourselves to learn from and imagine new opportunities in the world of Geocaching. Our hope is we can take the lessons from Challenges and create better tools to guide you on your next adventure.

Sincerely,

i think that its awesome that she does this, and im pretty sure that kids that find those toys in caches think its awesome as well because what kid doesnt like toys. but then theres the complaining adults who hate the fact that they find toys when they open a lock n lock. every time i see a complaint about this on logs and boards, i really want to ask them what they expected to find in there and ask them why the toys bothered them so much, but i just keep it to myself. it kind of irritates me since i know there are so many kids that go out with their families, and those kids are probably just like my cousin who get so much joy out of leaving something for a stranger to find. i cant hate on that. 

question is, has this always been an issue? i mean, i feel like the whole idea of this silly game is to get some exercise and explore places that you may not have been before....with cool swag being a bonus. so when did it become so serious? do some people take this too seriously? does anyone else come across this kind of stuff around their area? i can understand if its a premium only pathtag trading post or something, but the 'trade even, trade up, or dont trade' thing is kinda blah for regular caches that are kid friendly and available to anyone. am i the only one that gets a little peeved by this? 

sorry if this has been discussed before. maybe i just have a case of cabin fever and im overthinking lol...but i just think there are some adults in this game that need to take lessons from the kids that are playing too. :/

1329513671.0,39,self.geocaching,puehp,My evolving feelings about geocaching.,FaramirofWI,49,10,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/puehp/my_evolving_feelings_about_geocaching/,"I'm relatively new to the hobby, having been geocaching for about three years now.  When I first started it was a lot of fun and I loved it.  It got me out hiking again, and took me to places I would have never gotten to otherwise.  I quickly found all the caches in my area, and planned trips specifically for geocaching.

Since then my feelings have changed a bit.  I don't plan for geocaching much anymore.  I'm much more interested in hiking/backpacking, and if there's a geocache on my route I'll stop and get it but I rarely go out of my way.  Urban caches don't really interest me at all anymore.

So why the change?  A big part of it is the proliferation of caches that just don't interest me at all.  Park 'n grabs with nothing unique about them, caches placed irresponsibly, and a general movement from quality to quantity.  I also cannot ignore the real damage that can be done to sensitive areas by poorly placed caches and careless cachers.  On top of all this is a general dislike for Groundspeak and their proprietary ways. 

I do still geocache and I still enjoy it, but I am a little afraid of what it's becoming.  It should never be about numbers, but about appreciating and experiencing the world around us (in a responsible way). 

These are just my thoughts, and I'd be interested in hearing yours.  ",,False,,t5_2qyvl,False,,,True,t3_puehp,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/puehp/my_evolving_feelings_about_geocaching/,

After talking another minute with the police he hung up and told me he was going to let it go. I apologized for the misunderstanding and wished them a good evening before heading to my car. Whew!

My man and I met and dated for almost a year before we got engaged, and some of those dates included geocaching (a now favorite hobby of his that I introduced him to). On Halloween 2010 we had taken a trip up to Salem, Ma to visit his friends and enjoy the spirit of the season. He had been telling me that he had read of some caches in the city and there was one in particular he wanted to find. He said that it was attached to the statue in the center of town of Samantha from ""Bewitched"". 
We got to the statue, with a crowd of people around it all taking pictures. We took ours, and he looked on the statue for a minute and pulled up a magnetic microcache. He handed it over to me to open, and I pulled out a tiny scroll of paper that read, ""I fear no fate(for you are my fate, my sweet)i want
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true), i carry your heart with me(i carry it in my heart)"". As this happens to be his favorite E.E. Cummings poem I looked to him with excitement, to find that he was on one knee in front of me, with a beautiful sapphire ring, asking me to marry him. Now how could I say no to that?

Everyone's advice and encouragement and information really helped.  Since that post I've found two traditional caches and two microcaches, including a 2-star difficulty one that had eluded me twice previously.  Now that I've seen an ammo box up close and I've seen what forms microcaches can take, I feel so much more prepared to search for them.

It also looks like the one that had shaken my confidence might actually be missing, and that's why I couldn't find it.  There has been a DNF logged since my last search and it notes that the space where it should have been is empty.  I guess that was just bad luck that I happened to choose one that was missing just when I was trying to get my geocaching sea legs.

1301234845.0,27,self.geocaching,gcho5,Opencaching.com: Let's make an effort!,akoumjian,34,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/gcho5/opencachingcom_lets_make_an_effort/,"Fellow geocachers,

Many of you are probably aware of the new Garmin developed site: [Opencaching.com](http://www.opencaching.com). In many ways this site is superior to geocaching.com both from a cacher's perspective and from a software developer's perspective. IMHO the site is easier to navigate, and is much easier to use with Garmin devices.

As a software developer, opencaching.com does what geocaching.com explicitly does not. Geocaching.com is a closed proprietary system. If I wanted to create an iPhone app for Geocaching.com, I couldn't get access to the cache data without setting up some kind of expensive licensing agreement. Their system is proprietary and gated.

On the other hand, opencaching.com provides a RESTful API which means that I can easily develop my own web, Facebook, Android, iPhone, or other applications to interact with the site data and create a new/better/alternative user experience. To me, this much better represents the kind of philosophy the geocaching community shares.

Opencaching's greatest weakness is the utter lack of caches. Here in southern Vermont I've got about three within a 30 mile radius. What would really help is if everytime one of us places a new cache on geocaching.com, to take the time to make an additional listing on opencaching.com.

**TL/DR**: When you place a new cache, please add it to opencaching.com. It will be much more beneficial to our community in the long run.

Much to our delight we discovered that the Blue Ridge Chamber of Commerce embraces geocaching and placed several hides around town. 

However, we've discovered that they've published deliberately squishy coordinates in an effort to get seekers to go inside the local businesses and ask for help. In one case the coordinates are more than 100 feet off. They bring you to the entrance of a business, and if the owners spot you they'll save you from DNFing by leading you out back and showing you the cache on the rear deck. Log after log for each of the hides shows that this is a common pattern.

Am I being too picky by being annoyed by this? On the one hand I feel like I should be happy to see a city embracing and encouraging the activity. On the other hand, I hate being watched while I search, especially if I'm DNFing. And I never ever want help. I ended up choosing to leave rather than ask for help on the first two, and got wise on the third and found it on my own by reading every previous log for clues.

If they were puzzle caches where you had to ask the stores for a clue, that would be one thing. But these were traditionals.

Am I looking a gift horse in the mouth? How does the community feel about cities using Geocaching to drive tourists into businesses?

________________________________________________

Hello Foundit! 

Just wanted to give everyone an update on my situation. First off- **big thank you** to everyone who helped me by weighing in, providing perspective and citing specific rules. 

After some back and forth with a very nice Groundspeak Community Support Specialist, I was given some instruction on how to go about getting the cache unarchived. I followed her instructions and came up with what *i think* is a clever way to keep the hide virtually the same while operating within the rules. [Check the new hide!](http://imgur.com/a/UX9oI#0) Might even bump it from a D4 to D5?? Thoughts?

Now with the hide deemed ""legal"" by groundspeak- I submitted everything via-email to OReviewer and am waiting to hear from him about my new request to unarchive. 

I'll post his reply here, I can't see any reason why he would blow me off or decide to leave it archived... 

EDIT: No word back today from the reviewer :/

I was in &lt;Indiana Suburb&gt; and I found one with a 2.5 difficulty that was a micro so it was inside of some kind of bison container... I only know that name because it was the decrypted hint.  

Anyway, I had to climb through about six feet of shrubbery and I found it wedged in between two trees.  Took me about a half an hour!  Anyway, I biked a few miles and when I got home I found out that one of my neighbors had a geocache at their house like fifty meters from my house.  The description said ""stop by and say hi!  don't mind the barking dogs, their bark is worse than their bite."" 

Unfortunately, my c:geo ap was being weird with the compass so I was just looking around the block that the arrow said it would be located on.  Some guy with a tribal arm band came walking out of his garage and his little girl came running out in a diaper and said HI.

  As I was standing in front of his house looking at what appeared to be a large cooler (the description said a 'large cache box'), I thought it would be awkward if I didn't break the ice and ask him if that was a cache box.  Boy was I wrong!  ""What are you talking about?""  He looked at me like he didn't believe me/hadn't heard of geocaching/ ""are you taking pictures of my house?""

  I show him the app and he's like ""did someone put my address in there?

Vegas is pretty much 99% microcaches, unless you go to Red Rock. So I am going to try and change that.  This one isnt huge, it's a decent size. Its one of [these](http://i.imgur.com/fbLLBQL.jpg) with the MGM Grand logo on it. I am going attempt to place larger ones even though it is pretty difficult to find good cache locations here and I probably bit off more than I can chew with wanting to place 52. But I will try!

- The Beginner Photographer! Bring an actual camera, old school, not the one on your phone. (Reason : Most companies still prefer the use of photos from an actual camera, shows established business exists.) Take shots of the area. Hold up GPS, which coincidentally looks like a light meter from a distance. Bring friends, pose in front of things. Play as you are checking out the area. I've found this strategy actually attracts friendly people who want to know what you are up to. Be truthful, and always emphasize you are having fun playing a game.

- The Field Agent and Photographer. Bring a clipboard, include forms and notes, LAT and Long coordinates. Write things down as you are observing the area. This strategy tends to make people stay away from what you are doing and MAY call more attention to you. BUT! It does tend to keep the critics away, AKA the Dude who wants to enforce his ego. It also provides a really good reason for you to take notes on the area. Presence of clipboard actually helps your overall image as being official.

- The Enthusiast. Invite random strangers to check out what you are doing. Or take a picture of you and the site. People know that these games exist, telling them about it helps you blend in. Once suspicous people find out what you are doing, 98% of the time, they are cool with it, and they go on with their lives. 

ALWAYS! 
- Bring pamphlets or information for the GPS game you are playing.. Ingress, Geocaching, etc. Give the Business card or QR Code to the game websites. Show the sites on your smartphone. 
- Have the logos of the game on your paraphenalia (hat, clipboard, sleeve patch, decal on car) so you can link back and show TPTB (the powers that be) what you are doing.
- Have 2 contacts that you can refer officials to exchange information. AKA ""Yes officer, there are many people playing this game in [local town]""  Also inform them when the next meeting/meet up is occuring, tell them to come out to it.
- Have fun and emphasize that this is JUST A GAME.

[x-post from r/AskReddit]",youshouldbeworking,27,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/rnar6/has_anyone_ever_found_a_golden_goose_statue_or/,"Dear Reddit,

So I've tried googling this, but to no avail, so I figured I'd ask around here and see what sort of response I could get.

A few years back, while camping in Yosemite National Park in CA, my sister and I found what was basically a little statue of a golden goose in our campsite’s ‘bear locker’ box. On the bottom it gave instructions to take it with you somewhere, take a picture of it there, send the picture to a certain website (and say where it was taken), and then leave the statue for another random person to do the same. The goal seemed to be how far they could get this little guy to go. Which I thought was awesome.

So awesome, in fact, did I find this idea, that I decided to take the goose to Scotland with me. (By this time I had looked them up online, saw they also had a cat statue and some other stuff. I think their starting point was somewhere Midwest, but I wish I could remember more details).

However, although I placed him and took pictures, I never managed to find that site again (computer issues, mostly), and it's been bothering me for quite a while now that I've never been able to share with them my pictures, or find out where he went next. The people who started this project seemed like cool kids, so my hope is that at least one of them is a Redditor, and if not, perhaps some of you have encountered these figures or their blog before, or have some idea of what I'm talking about (because seriously, google completely failed me. But I know Reddit can do this! We’ve connected people with the cameras they’ve lost in other countries!).

Below are the pictures I took. Sorry about the poor quality, but I wanted him with a view of the castle, and although I had a couple of other placements with him around the city during the day, those same computer troubles that caused me to lose track of the site left me with only the very final pictures.

tl;dr - Some kids on the internet made an interactive art project. I helped by bringing a golden goose to Scotland. Haven't been able to find their site since. Help!

A little over a year ago I saw that one was within walking distance of my house, so my son and I went and found it.  We didn't look for any more until this past July, when my father (an avid cacher) gave my son a Travel Bug as part of his birthday present.  We put it in the local cache and it started moving within the week!  Since the end of July we have found 54 caches.  

I'm loving this hobby, and had a few thoughts and observations that I figure I'd share and discuss.  Sorry in advance for the wall of text!

- I live in the Philadelphia suburbs, which is heavily developed, so lots of urban type caches (think parking lot micros) BUT Geocaching has led me to  discover at least a dozen amazing local parks that I had no idea existed, some of which are only a 5-10 minute drive from home.  I *never* would have found these without Geocaching.

Notable one - http://coord.info/GC3B97E which is this tiny little park that has one of the largest trees in PA in it; a sycamore tree that's been around since the 1600s.  It's 2 blocks off of a road I've driven down hundreds of times, and I never knew it was there.

- One of my favorite aspects of this has been the history.  We have a local cacher who has many hides related to the local history of the area, including old train factories and rail lines.  I love this kind of stuff!

- My first 20 or so finds were just done with a printout of a Google Maps page and the recent logs.  Obviously this wouldn't work for hides in the woods, but for my area there are tons of hides in places with landmarks that are easy to spot from the satellite photos. I was a lurker on this subreddit for a while and really wanted to cache, but always felt that there was no point w/o a GPS or smartphone.  Obviously I was wrong.

- I read a lot of posts on this subreddit about people getting bored with this, or disliking particular types of caches.  No boredom yet, but I've already found many of the ones closest to where I live, and soon it's going to be something I need to plan to make a short trip for, rather than just grab one in a park on the way home from work. 

- I also see merits to the different types of hides.  I was at a large local park, bushwacking through thick scrub, smacking my head into low branches, dodging massive amounts of poison ivy, and getting torn to shreds by thorns.  All in 95 degree weather the day after a storm, so everything was soaked and steamy.  20 minutes of this and I left empty handed, and was totally craving a quick park and grab just as a confidence booster... and as a way to stay in my car's AC as long as possible.

- My 7 year old is a ""free pass"" to investigate caches.  I'm 6'8"" tall, so not very inconspicuous.  Nobody looks twice if I'm climbing a tree or looking underneath some shrub as long as my son is there with me, which has led me to find stuff that I would never get away with otherwise.  Likewise, he *loves* finding some of the lamp post hides - if anyone is in the parking lot, I pretend to make a cell phone call while he investigates the light pole skirt thing.  If people see us they just think he's a bored little kid messing around and I'm an inattentive parent, when in actuality we are having an awesome little father and son adventure.

- I've found several trackables from all over the world.  One of them that stood out was http://coord.info/TB48PQM, not because of what it was (just a key), but because the owner had taped the cache destination on the Travel Bug on a little piece of paper with 4 point font.  With no smartphone, I have no idea whether a trackable I find needs to go in a particular direction.  This one was a no brainer.  My GPS (eTrex 20) does paperless Geocaching, but unless the trackable was mentioned in the last 5 logs, I have no idea about its destination.

- My family took a short vacation to the NJ shore, and it was great to see how different the hides were.  I also found some caches that were official Cape May County tourism hides http://www.thejerseycape.com/geocaching-cape-may-county-nj.htm  Very neat way to get people to explore the area.

A notable shore find - http://coord.info/GC1AK8K  Just a magnetic keyholder, but in/around/on a *very* busy landmark that's constantly surrounded by people.  A great way to hone your stealth skills.

- I'm planning my first hides.  Spending this last month looking for caches has really shown me what think makes a good hide.  I read a post on here a while back where someone suggested that people be prevented from making hides until they have found 30 or 50 or something, and I have to kind of agree.  What I thought would make a good hide a month ago is wildly different than what I would want to find now.  

The two series of hides I'm working on with my 7 year old ""helper"" are quite different.  My son was digging through a junk box in our garage when he stumbled across a perfect container for a ""Classic Arcade Game"" theme hide, and since then we have scouted locations that would be perfect for ""Breakout"", ""Frogger"", ""Pac Man"" (or ""Ms. Pac Man""), and ""Asteroids"", all of which fit the theme and let me use unique containers and share a little bit of arcade history, which just so happens to be another one of my hobbies.

The second series is based off of a Solar System Walk (e.g. http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/events/solrwalk.html) that I had previously designed as a science project for school at my work. I'm planning on centering the sun on a town landmark, and then each hide will be hidden on the orbital path of that particular planet.  I live in a tiny little town with a lot of parks, but the inner planets are not going to be .10 miles apart, so they will be done as a multi puzzle with the actual hide ending on the orbit of the asteriod belt.  You will be able to walk this whole multi pretty easily, but after that you'll need to do some driving to get to the remaining planets. 

I have an overlay that I set up in Google Earth, and each planet's orbit lines up to a swath through a park (whew!), so I still have a bit of scouting to do to find the final spots.  I'm also thinking about making some sort of meta puzzle to include Pluto, but it's so far out there that you'd need to go over to the next town to find the GZ. 

Well, that's it. Sorry again for the wall of text, but I really am excited about this hobby!  I'd also love to hear from other new cachers (and experienced ones as well) about what you have found to be the most fun about Geocaching.",,False,,t5_2qyvl,False,,,True,t3_yr89z,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/yr89z/a_few_thoughts_and_observations_after_my_first/,

The best part was at the event last night, though.  I arrived early and sat down next to a few others that arrived early.  One of them was a local sort of legend who is close to 10,000 finds.  As they were talking, I overheard the well-known cacher telling the others about the awesome cache he found that day.  He kept saying how every stage of the multi was extremely awesome and that they all had to go find it.  The more he was talking about it, the more I realized he was talking about my newest cache.  I then introduced myself as the cache owner.  He got very excited, jumped up, shook my hand and bought me a beer.   

To me the most important number in this game are favorite points.  The validation that I get from cachers that I have made a great cache is the best satisfaction I can get in this game.  Hearing someone as well regarded as him talk for several minutes about how great my cache was really makes me happy, it is sort of justification for all the hard work I put into my hides.

I eventually got frustrated by the wind blowing my charcoal everywhere, so I decided to take a break. I started to read the graffiti all over the tables of the shelter. They were all derogatory and inappropriate, but it kept me entertained. After reading the tables, I looked up and saw that there was MORE writing on the rafters. I stood up on the table to get a better view, looked to my left, and saw a pill bottle covered in black tape. I was RIDICULOUSLY excited, thinking I was going to ruin someone's drug deal and help better the world. Instead, I opened it and found a log and some tiny items. I felt so cool, having stumbled upon some secret game. I went to the website, and have been caching ever since.

There was nothing inside, but it's definitely a geocache. A camo-taped pill bottle hidden in an ourdoor light fixture? How could it be anything else? Of course, my fiance didn't believe me, thought that I looked it up and planned it. We checked online and it's unlisted.

This article provides some basic guidelines to consider.


**1. Location!** A quality cache needs a good location, something to see which a person might not bother to stop at or not know about otherwise. It doesn't have to be a great view from a mountain, it can just be a nice section of woods getting there, or a nice park, or something historical or bizarre. Make sure the area is not private property, and be careful hiding caches near RR tracks or federal buildings or bridges - most often caches in these locations will not be approved. If the cache has little to offer in the form of location, it should make up for it in some other manner.

Pay attention to what impact the location of the cache will make on it's surroundings. Imagine what the area will look like in different seasons and times of day - visiting muggles, vegetation growth, undesirables frequenting the area, and animal life. If the area is sensitive, make note in the description what steps the cacher should take to insure minimal damage.

**2. Hide!** A quality cache should be hidden well, but match it's rating. It should be hidden in a manner where a cacher could find it, but geomuggles probably would not notice it easily. Otherwise, it is doomed to be plundered. If the cache has little to offer in the form of the hide, it should make up for it in some other manner.

Pay attention to what impact the hide can play on the area. Imagine where cachers may look for the cache if they are not looking in the right place. Imagine less careful cachers removing surrounding items while looking for your cache. If the area is sensitive, make note in the description where not to look, or what not to look under or near.

**3. Variety!** A quality cache need not be like every other one in your neighborhood. If the area is full of 1/1's, try hiding a harder one, or vise versa. If the area is full of traditional caches, hide a multi or an unknown or puzzle cache. Incorporate your interests or hobbies into the cache, and derive coordinates for the final stage from that.

**4. Properly rated!** An official unofficial rating system can be found at http://clayjar.com/gcrs/ Live it! Love it! Sometimes a cache turns out to be more or less difficult than intended, so if people seem to be finding the cache easier or harder than you originally anticipated, adjust the ratings slightly on the cache page.

**5. Good Coords!** GPSrs are not as accurate as many think, And a cacher will most likely be testing your coords once, so it is up to the hider to be confident his/her coords are as close as possible. Many of the newer GPSrs are more accurate, but when the GPSr says it’s accuracy is 10 feet, it may not be. The best way to be sure is to revisit the cache site different times on different days before submitting the cache and average any of those that the accuracy is decent. Enter the averaged coords in your GPSr manually and go back to the site as if you were a cacher and see how close it takes you. In areas of good reception a couple tries is sufficient, but you may want to revisit more often in dense tree cover. If cachers continually note that the coords may be off, check them again and edit your cache page accordingly as soon as possible.

**6. Effort!** Nothing is more impressive than a cache that shows some effort. Historical information to go along with the cache site, well written cache descrcriptions, and clear and concise instructions make a big difference. Make sure any cache attributes are correct. A container that is camo'd or otherwise cleverly made or hidden is an added bonus. Meeting all or most of the other criteria in this article shows effort!

**7. Good Containers!** Containers should be of decent construction and seal well. If it doesn't seal well, expect to have to maintain it more. I like ammo boxes - They seal real well, and there is little doubt whether it is closed tight or not. Obviously, there are places when ammo boxes will not work, so just choose your container thoughtfully, especially if it's in an area where water, ice, animals, or other dangers might be a factor.

**8. Right size container for the area!** Not very often is there a need for a micro in the middle of a million acre forest nor is it safe to hide a .50 cal ammo box in a city alley. With a little forethought, it's not hard to hide a larger container well.

**9. Good Contents!**You don't need to spend a fortune on contents, but there is no need for broken or dangerous items. Geocaching.com will not approve a cache if they know there are knives, lighters, matches, alcohol, adult material, or other dangerous materials inside. And - NO FOOD OR SCENTED items! Animals can smell soap, food, scented candles, air fresheners, and such and come after your cache. Even an ammo box might not be safe from a crafty raccoon or a bear. Plus if any dampness gets in the cache, it can make it really smell nasty. Many people have allergies to the candles and air fresheners, and after being closed up in a cache can make them quite potent when opened. If you gets logs mentioning damp or unwanted objects in your cache, check on it soon and take care of the issue.

**10. Maintenance!** Check your cache on a regular basis. Obviously, caches that are found more often or that are in an area where muggles could find it need to be checked more often. Containers that are of lesser quality or that do not have a tight seal will need to be checked for dampness or mold. If anyone reports a bad condition or multiple DNFs, check on it! And don't hide one where you can't check on it in a timely manner! Don't expect other cachers to maintain it for you. It's very gracious of a finder to help a cache out, but the responsibility is with the cache hider, not the finder!

**11. Disable where needed!** If a cache turns up missing or otherwise compromised and you intend to replace or repair it, disable it and post a note as to why it's disabled and when you plan to replace it. You can re-enable it yourself without intervention from a Groundspeak volunteer. We don't need cachers digging up the countryside if a cache isn't there.

**12. Archive when needed!** If a cache is missing or you have retrieved it, or are moving to a new place and will not be able to maintain a cache, and you have no plans to replace it or let someone adopt it, archive it! Event caches should be archived shortly after the event, when enough time has been given for visitors to log it (If someone is still late, they can still log an archived cache). If you archive your cache, you will need and volunteer to re-enable it if you do replace it, so do not archive if you plan to replace the cache soon.

**13. Communication!** Check your gc.com emails on a regular basis. Respond to emails concerning your caches. Send emails to finders if you have questions or just want to congratulate them - if your cache is their first, send an email welcoming them to the sport, and invite them to join Geocaching Maine! Be friendly and fair if there is a disagreement. If you are not willing to do this, don't place a cache!

**14. Guidelines!** Before placing or submitting your cache, read the geocaching.com guidelines for placing a cache! These guidelines can be found at http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx and if you don't read and place your cache according to these guidelines, your cache may not be approved and it will just make more work for the Groundspeak volunteers and yourself. Be sure to re-read these guidelines before placing every cache as they change as our national security and other factors change.

* If there are 3 caches of a given size within a 0.25 mill radius, you can only apply to put in a new one if it is larger than those.

* Add a ""nano"" size so that those of us who hate bison tubes can avoid them

* Standardize sizes: i.e. a 35mm film canister is a ""micro"", not a ""small"". A normal tupperware container is a ""small"", not a ""regular"".

From what I understand, with a dedicated GPS, I'd have to search for caches while at my computer, transfer the info about the caches to my GPS, then once I find it, go back to a computer to log the visit.

Heck, I've only been doing this for about 8 months.

That being said, I'm getting incredibly frustrated with trying hide geocaches. 10 of my 11 hides so far are, if I do so say so myself, better than average. I put a lot of thought and care into making my caches either good hides or fun to find when you get them (i.e. field puzzle caches). 

I have had several caches completed or near complete sitting around for months now because I cannot find places to hide them. I recently just went through an episode where I thought I was good, got permission from the land owner, but GPS error revealed that I was 40 feet closer than I'm allowed to be to another cache.

I wouldn't be upset if I were surrounded by great caches, or even slightly above-average caches, but it's just not the case. Half of the caches I find around me are old drink bottles wrapped in electrical tape and stuffed under a light post skirt. Of the 106 caches I've found, I'd say 100 have been flat-out bad. Here I am trying to improve the game, and I simply can't, because my area is saturated. I don't want to venture too far from home for my hides, because that will make maintenance too difficult.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I just needed to vent. I'm trying to enjoy this hobby and do my part to make it better, but it's only succeeded in making my free time so frustrating that I'm almost certain to be done hiding, and I may be done finding as well.

Then after reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gmrft/i_need_a_hobby_what_are_yours/c1opj9l) post, i decided i'd give it a go. I was planning on going for a walk anyway, might as well make it more interesting.  

I signed up on geocaching.com and looked up my address. Score: there was one about half a mile away, and a few more a bit further away. I downloaded the free app on my phone, to put in the code, but i guess the free version just chooses a few near by, and it wouldn't choose the one i wanted (i can't afford the full app).  

So i looked on the map, and found that it was just by a railway crossing, a place i knew well, so i figured i'd have a go at finding it anyway.  

Once i got there, i just started looking around, i knew i was looking for a small tube. There were a few people nearby (muggles?) so i was trying to be discrete. After about 5 minutes of looking, i was about to give up, when i noticed a small, white tube in the bushes. From the path it was blocked by nettles, so i tried from the other side. I climbed over a few longs and pushed aside a few branches to get inside the bush, but it was still difficult to get to. There was no way i was going to reach it without getting scratched to pieces.  
Disappointed, i got my phone out and decided to go for the next nearest one, about 1km away.  

It was a nice walk along a cycle path that i haven't been on for years, i got hit by a wave of nostalgia on the way. once i was nearby, i checked the map. The description mentioned a bridge, and i could see one not far away. I made my way over there and checked the map again, but it still said i was 50m away. Then i realised that i was facing east, not north, and i had walked past another, smaller bridge just seconds ago. 

As i got near, my phone beeped and told me i was getting near to the cache. Just then two guy walked over the bridge and chose right then and there to have a conversation. I sat on a nearby fence waiting for them to walk away. I sat there, took a few pictures, listened to some music, but they seemed determined to discuss eachother's life stories.  

It began to rain, so I had to give up and return home. Slightly disappointed, but i did have a nice time, despite not actually finding any caches. I'll try again in a few days, there's some more caches the other direction down the cycle path, maybe i'll bring a friend this time, so it doesn't look quite as weird just one guy searching through bushes.

Good idea?,AMagill,22,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/deyij/ive_been_pondering_making_some_very/,"I've been toying with the idea of a series of geocaches with a high degree of technical challenge.  I'm thinking a number of different caches, each containing some bit of encoded information needed to solve one of the others, or to find a final cache.  I want successful players to have to solve a variety of technical problems for themselves.

A few of my ideas so far:

* A key, tethered down by steel cable.  You have to figure out how to make a copy to use in a lock elsewhere.  (Or pick the lock!)

* A flashlight that flashes out a message at high frequency.  You must devise a way to capture and decode the signal.

* An exotic variety of barcode, containing a clue.  You must identify and decode it.

* Enciphered text.  You must perform the cryptanalysis to break it- should be theoretically doable with pen and paper.

* Some device that only works between midnight and 1am.

* A device you have to 'sneak up' on- motion renders it inoperable for a time.


Things I'm trying to avoid:

* Any component of this being on the internet- like a link to download a file, or entering a password on a web page.

* Flash drives, anything you have to plug into something.  Too problematic.

* Scary-looking devices that might cause a bomb scare.

* Any steps that cause the caches to be temporarily or permanently unsolvable.  No removing key items.

* Requiring any expensive tools or equipment.  Nobody (sufficiently clever) should have to spend more than $25 to solve it.


Any device I build as part of this will have to be very durable, freeze-tolerant, maintenance-free, tamper-proof, and inexpensive.  I'd prefer no accessible wires/contacts/metal whatsoever.  Probably not much more complex than lithium battery (ages and tolerates cold well), microcontroller (an MSP430 will run for years on a small battery), LEDs, and reed switches for any inputs (bring your own magnet!).

This would be done in the area of Boulder, CO.  This is a university town with a good engineering school, so there should be no shortage of people with the skills to do this.  I'm worried that few or none of those people are also geocachers, though.  I might be willing to add a $100 First-To-Find prize.

While in Chicago I had a BLAST! great people, great forum website, lots of hides, lots of meetings.
Then I moved to southeastern michigan, between pontiac and flint. I figured out why there aren't as many caches out where I'm at the first time I tried to place a cache. too much rule enforcement. Now mind you this was about 4-5 years ago and I haven't check recently, but I couldn't even place a cache on state land! When I submited the cache, the mod told me I would have had to go get a permit. When I tried, no one knew what I was talking about, and after I week I just gave up. The cache is still sitting out there for all I know. There wasn't much of a community as far and website/forums either when I checked back then. I'm thinking of getting back into caching and though I would check to see if there is anyone from the clarkston, ortonville, goodrich, grand blanc area that could let me know how things stand nowadays, I have even considering building a website for this area if there is any interest/need.",,False,,t5_2qyvl,False,,,True,t3_1dprm1,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/1dprm1/difference_from_state_to_state/,

I found a cache online that was only a block away from our apartment and was marked 1 star, 1 star. So my gf and I went for a walk to find it. We started looking around the building where it was supposed to be hidden and after 20 or 30 minutes still couldn't find it. It got a little discouraging so we started looking up pictures of it online and still couldn't find it. Some friends walked by and asked what we were doing and then they joined the hunt too. another 10 minutes goes by and while we're crouched over at the side of this building, a guy walks by and says, ""hey it should be right here"" while pointing at some grating we had looked at a million times. He comes over and checks and it wasn't there at all, so it must have been lost or taken. We laughed and said, ok so it's like we found it. I'm glad that guy walked by because otherwise the experience would have been quite discouraging to not find a 1-1 that was a block away. But now I think we will go look for a new cache tomorrow!

It was dead, scary, and hollow enough to put a neat micro in.  This tree was huge and was surrounded by many smaller, living trees and looked like it was begging for a cache.  So I got off my bike and retrieved my supply bag that I use to repair and hide caches, just as I remembered there was a key box attached to a light pole about 200 feet away.  As everyone probably knows, caches can't have other caches within 528 feet of them.  So because of this simple, P&amp;G cache that someone could have placed by leaning out of their car window, my cache idea was a no-go.  Geocaching is supposed to be a happy, friendly, fun for everyone activity, and I support and love that, but I think we should encourage each other to really put some time and thought into our caches as opposed to making a cache that looks like it was placed because someone saw a blank spot on the map and they felt the urge to populate.  I know that not everyone can get on that trail and that for elderly, disabled, or young people, the light pole cache is probably preferable.  However, these types of caches are everywhere and they really are ruining opportunities for some of the more creative and adventurous cachers among us.  I like all types of caches, simple and complex, and I wouldn't like it if there were no P&amp;G's.  But if you live in an area that already has quite a few simple, everyone-friendly caches, think about whether the cachers in the area really need another film canister under a lamp post skirt or a camo pill bottle thrown into a random tree 5 feet from the sidewalk.  r/geocaching is but 6,004 cachers out of them all, but it is a start to try and get some variety going on out there because I don't believe that caching has to be about finding something to do with your kids or an excuse to exercise.  It can be adventurous and challenging and that is what I love.

Nothing wrong with Canadian money, but I want to keep it diverse.

Some rules I was thinking of...

(I'm in the US btw)

First off I'm planning on making it a premium cache.  I don't want it to get taken in the first week.

* Absolutely no US currency, anything that was ever circulated in the US is not allowed.

    Bullalo nickles are cool and all but I really want modern foreign coins.

* Cachers can't replace the last of one currency with a currency that is already in the cache

    No taking the last Franc and putting in a Euro when there are 3 Euros already in the cache

* No North American Currency.  (I'm not 100% sure on this one, but I think it's a good idea..)

    I don't want coins from far away to be replaced with pesos from your spring break trip.

The only foreign coins I have right now are

* Belgium Franc

* French Franc

* South Korean Won

* Hong Kong Dollar

Only a few of each.  Nothing worth more than a dollar or two US.

Anyways, is this a good idea? or should I just hold on to my treasures.. What rules would you add?

However, I have noticed that the more geocaches I find, the more I learn what and where to look for.  For example, I had about 13 cahes found when I came across my first Micro.  I starred right at the thing and thought it was just a screw that was part of the sign it was attached to (same color as the sign too).  Thought nothing of it.  Looked around some more and kept going back to the sign because that's where the GPS coordinates were pointing to.  I just happened to grab the screw to pull on it ""just in case"" and sure enough it popped right off.  I had no idea that this would even be big enough to contain a log.

Another example that furthered my experience on what to look for was my interest in setting some geocaches myself.  I went to Amazon and typed in ""geocaching"" and saw all the different kinds of cache containers.  Some were just downright evil in my opinion: fake rocks with hollowed insides, real rocks with hollowed insides, a magnetic metal plate that looks like an electrical plate (so it looks like it would belong), pennies with vials glued to the bottom so that you press the vial into the ground and it just looks like a penny sitting on the ground, a fake sprinkler, etc.

So now I ask you as a fairly new geocacher, what advice do you give to newbies that you wish someone had told to you in the beginning.

I've already found two new parks I never knew existed in the 4 years I've been working at my current company.  It's worth it to keep trying for that alone.

That said, I think I'm terrible at this and it's kind of discouraging.  Twice I've been sure I was close but there were homeless gentlemen camped out where the coordinates pointed.  Twice I inadvertently went after microcaches (before I learned about sizes) and had to log a DNF because I just couldn't figure out what I was looking for.

I get nervous about people seeing me searching so I give up quickly.  I'm not really sure how much thrashing around in the brush I should be doing, or if thrashing around in the brush means I'm doing it wrong.

I feel like I need one good find that's all mine to get my confidence up.  Are there any tips you can provide for someone who's clearly overthinking this?  Most of what I can go after right now are in suburban or urban areas.  I even find park and grabs baffling.  What am I doing wrong?

I decided to go caching today, since there is a geocache near my house that's been giving me trouble (finally got it today, woo-hoo!), and just for kicks, I thought I'd try to find the Munzee that was near by as well.

I went to GZ, expecting to look for a cache container. Upon arrival there was a Munzee QR Code in plain sight. It dawned on me at that moment, that Munzee is about finding QR Codes in public, not caches. Not exactly a geocaching clone, but after the initial excitement, it leaves a lot to be desired.

Now that I have the app, I will probably try to find more Munzee's in the future, but I can't shake the cold soulless feeling it gives me. There's no clever containers, no tradables, no log book, nothing. Just a cold, QR code stuck somewhere.

I'll probably only go for more Munzees after I've found all the geocaches in a particular area and I'm still craving a hunt, but I would never go out for a day of ""Munzeeing"" or whatever they call it. Ugh, such a terrible name.

Anyway, that's my thoughts on Munzee.

The email read as follows: ""Please remove any of my caches from your search list in the future. There are plenty of other peoples caches for you to search for."" I was really concerned and looked through my logs to find out how I was connected to this particular cacher and found that we had recently discovered one of his hides. My find log noted that our GPS was jumping around a lot and that it was hard to find the cache as it was placed in a black plastic bag and was surrounded by a lot of debris(I.E. garbage such as empty alcohol bottles, other plastic bags, needles, and broken bottles) I noted this fact as well in my log as I felt it was a sad thing that the beautiful park it was located in was in such disrepair. I ended by saying that we removed some of the trash and TFTC. Did I do something wrong or out of line by suggesting that this cache was located in a dirty area or something? I don't feel like I crossed any social boundaries or made any negative comments about either the hider or the cache itself simply that the park was in poor condition which is no reflection at all on the cache or the hider. In any case I just don't want to offend other cachers and was hoping reddit might have some insight.

My back needed a stretch, so I leaned back, and there it was about ten feet above me!! I saw the blue paint of the bison tube and knew that must be it. It was jammed into a hollow knot of a branch, and hanging from another branch far away from the actual tree, so I never would've looked there.

I tapped it with a branch and it swayed around like it was on a string, and of course, it was. I followed the string about thirty feet away to where it was tied to a branch that was propped against a tree.

1.	Does a dedicated GPS make a noticeable difference for finding caches or enhancing the experience? I’m currently using an iPhone5 but after a few bad experiences (DNF 3x in a row!) I’m wondering if a topographic map would be better for my area. For example, twice now I have been on a trail and come within 30 feet of a cache, but one side of the trail is a steep hill leading to a plateau and the other is a comparatively flat, rock-strewn field.  I’d think that having a good map on the GPS would help determine which side of the trail the cache is on and therefore limit frustration. There were no hints for these particular caches. 

2.	In relation to #1, can anyone comment on the quality of the free maps out there that you can get for GPS units? I’m planning on buying an Etrex 20 but I’m thinking the TOPO 24 maps are a bit too spendy for starting out. I’m planning on venturing out much more this year in my hiking endeavors so perhaps that will justify a good GPS anyway.

3.	Do you have a set time limit for giving up on finding a cache? After 30 minutes of unsuccessful searching for two in a row I was pretty discouraged and frustrated. Luckily I found the last one of the day but it could have turned into a bad first experience.

Besides these points I’m having a great time getting out doors and I’m really glad this subreddit exists.  Cheers!

When you hide a cache, what do you base your ""terrain"" value on? Going by the groundspeak guideline, it says I should set it as 5, since special equipment is required. I feel conflicted though, since the cache is hidden on a slow moving bend in the San Antonio River, where the water is almost perfectly flat. My cache details clearly state that a canoe or kayak is needed, I feel like I'm overrating it by making the terrain a 5. To me, a terrain 5 cache that requires paddling  implies whitewater kayaking, not a peaceful paddle.

What standards do you use when rating your paddle caches?

That being said I have to run out for a few, and then compile the data, so it might be a bit before the results are finalized.***


I picked up 7 packs of [these](http://i.imgur.com/mVTtn.jpg) Firetack knock-offs a while back because they were on clearance.  I had no plans for them, but I still felt compelled to buy out what they had left.  I'm tired of looking at them, so I want to give them away to people who might be able to use them for night caches or whatever.

At 5:58pm (Eastern time) on 9/30/12 I generated a random number through a website.  Guess the number, **from 1 to 1000, inclusive of both 1 and 1000.**  The 7 closest guesses will receive a PM from me, and I will need you to respond with a mailing address.

* **Only 1 guess per person**.  If you guess more than once you are disqualified.  If you want to change your guess for whatever reason, then either edit your original post before the deadline, or reply to your own post saying that you are changing your guess and include the new guess.

* Because shipping can get expensive, even for such a small package, I will have to **restrict this to the U.S. and Canada**. 

* These are **not real Firetack brand** tacks.  They are some generic knock-offs, but should still work fine for a night cache or whatever you have planned.

* I have 7 packs

* Each pack has 50 tacks.

* They are orange in color both in reflection and normally.

* Post your guess here, or PM it to me.  Doesn't matter. 

* I will let this run until Wednesday **10/3/2012 at 6:00pm Eastern**.

* You will need to trust an internet stranger with your mailing address.

* In the event of a tie-breaker, a new number will be generated, and the closest will be chosen from that.  

* I will send them the slowest, cheapest way possible, and in a small padded envelope.  If you need them the very next day, I cannot help you.  I will not ship them overnight, or hand deliver them (unless, of course, you are in the greater Columbus, Ohio area, then I can probably meet you somewhere or whatever) or anything else.  


***Edit again: Ok, I have already sent PMs to the lucky 7.  The random number was [216](http://i.imgur.com/gNaWX.jpg).  Just because I was curious.  The closest guess was 6 away, and the 7th guess was 59 away.  The winning guesses were 176, 222, 228, 232, 248, 263, and 275.  A total of 54 guesses were made.  The highest was 985, the lowest was PI.  The average of all guesses was 483.0026***

We are comparing the accuracy of cell phone GPS's to stand alone GPS Units. The results I've posted were from our first round at this project in November, which we did on campus. We used points out in the open, under canopy, in between buildings and near metal objects like fences. Our results are pretty interesting, but now we have backing to make the project larger. We will have more devices including tablets and were experimenting at a large state park with no cell phone reception (so the devices are forced to use their GPS chips and not just triangulate off the cell phone towers) and downtown in a major city (Nashville, TN). At both sites we will have 15 points each that are picked near different obstacles. We will record the coordinates, 5 different times at each point cycling the GPS on and off in between each test, then we take the average of the point. We then calculate the difference in meters from the averaged point of each device to our base point which we calculated of USGS’s map. We are limited to what is loaned to us, but any suggestions of different onsite tests we can do or any feedback will be great. We know this project is in the rough, Thanks Here are the links to the chart which has the averages and the Map we created.

Help with tips.,SeaShanties,15,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching/comments/1d0ppj/building_a_tardis_little_free_library_for_my/,"I have a kickstarter campaign going to help build a Little Free Library for my community (New Port Richey, FL) 

The Little Free Library is a ""Take a book / leave a book"" community project that's really great. I am planning to build one in the Police Box / TARDIS shape from Doctor Who. And of course I want to make it even more awesome by adding a cache to it!

So what I was thinking was building a wooden box on the back side of the library box with a hinged lid and latch. Something weather proof. I thought this would be fun for cachers to find and also enjoy the library. (Maybe a note on the cache page - ""bring a book to share/trade""?)

I would put a sign/sticker on the top of the lid, explaining that it's a Geocache - incase curious muggles want to learn more and be converted. But I also want ONLY Geocachers to have access to the box. So what do you think would be the best bet? A little four digit code lock on the box?

* Do you think think I should just put the combination on the cache page so people can unlock it?
* Have it be the last four of the coordinates?
* Or make it some sort of easy trivia or puzzle? Like ""The original Doctor Who TV series started in what year?"" and then have the date as the lock?
* Does making it a puzzle cache deter some from doing it, as opposed to just giving the answer? I know some people don't like puzzles.

I don't know enough about the technology. Is the difference between a $200 GPSr and a $600 unit just in the other features besides the satellite receiver, like screens, paperless caching, cameras, and such?

I intend to continue using my smartphone to see what caches are near me and to post my logs, but I want to use the GPSr to find the caches. I don't need a camera or anything like that, but I would like for the GPSr to have a compass.

Back in 2006 I was deployed to Japan with the U.S. Navy. A coworker there first told me about the hobby but I didn't really think much of it. Months later, I'm back home in California and I had bought a cheap Garmin eTrex (the very basic Yellow one, forgot the model). Originally just bought it for hiking; but later I remembered that hobby my coworker told me about.

I decided to start with the closest Geocache to my house (apparently, it doesn't exist anymore or I would've linked to it's geocaching.com page; but it was at approx 34°11'47""N, 119°14'18.30""W). It was located in the vicinity of what appeared to be an abandoned homeless camp in the middle of some coastal dunes less than a mile from my house (surprising to find this camp considering how clean and beautiful of an area I lived in at the time). To this day, it is still one of the most cleverly hidden caches I've found. The cache itself was a large plastic peanut-butter jar glued to the bottom of a very old/worn sandal. The jar was buried in the sand leaving the sandal to appear as if it was just sitting there on the sand like all the rest of the discarded possessions around it. When my GPS said I was on top of the cache, I just started kicking around all of the junk till I found anything that would catch my attention. A sandal that didn't move when I kicked it, definitely caught my attention. I dug up the jar, and from then on I was hooked.

I'm buying a new smart phone in the next week or so, and haven't really decided on what model. I'm not really picky when it comes to my phone, but as I use it for geocaching it's an important criteria for me to consider.

So, I used to use an iPhone 3GS and it was fine. At the moment the plus to getting a new iPhone is that I already have paid for the app. On the other hand, I would like to try out an Android based phone and I'm eyeing off the Galaxy S II. Has anyone used this one for geocaching? There's also the HTC Incredible S, does anyone have an experience with this model? 

Any other smart phone critiques for geocaching would be welcome! GPS accuracy, battery life etc.

I have been out today looking for my first one, which I found, and so quickly went to another. The problem is, I am only looking at the map on the website, i.e. not usign a GPS device etc. The map app that you get as standard didn't really work that well either... 

So, I looked for a geocaching app, and found the official geocaching app, but it cost like ¥850 (around $10). I am a bit apprehensive to purchase it at this cost, so I was wondering if any of you have opinions of it, or alternative ways of using the iPhone.

Thanks in advance.

Has there been a lovers tiff? Or is something bigger about to happen?

Also, why would Garmin release a geocaching product like Chirp without some kind of backing by Geocaching.com? Seems like a bad business model to have a $25 device that isn't able to be used on the biggest site.
