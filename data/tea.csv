This past weekend I finally took the first steps towards getting something off the ground.

I'll be applying the lean startup method to the somewhat-more-traditional world of tea, and I'd like to know if anyone would be interested in following along (and maybe providing some feedback) as I design, test, source products, and build the company. I would do a series of posts throughout the process.

Any interest?

**EDIT:** Wow! I whipped up this post before I headed out for the night, and was pleasantly surprised to come back this morning and find such a strong response! I'll be setting up a blog in the next few days to chronicle my progress -- I'll be sure come back and drop a link when it's ready.

Mind you, in my opinion it still isn't perfect, but it is definitely a step in the right direction. 

Here are some key points:

- Our whole new theme is going to be ""transparency"". In other words, when a customer asks a question, we are now allowed to give them a direct answer. No longer should you hear ""Well, how about we come inside and have Joe Shit the Rag Man tell you more.""

* We are no longer talking about the health benefits of the tea. However, if a customer asks about the benefits, we will be allowed to say ""Some of our customers say this helps them with their yadda-yadda-yadda..."". We just aren't allowed to lead the conversation. Now this is one that kind of gets me only because it's hard for us to completely avoid talking about health benefits especially when we have a tea called ""Weight to Go"" and a book called ""Healing Teas"". 

- Finally (and this is my absolute favorite), we will no longer be shoving pounds of tea down your throat. You come in and ask for 2 ounces, you get 2 ounces. We will only put one scoop in the bag or tin, tell you about the pound discount, then ask if you want to see what it looks like.

-Nothing was said about the prices which is one of the complaints we hear a lot, but like I said it isn't perfect. I'm just happy to see the sales process become a little more about meeting the customers wants and needs than the employee trying to meet their sales goal.

1344579597.0,151,self.tea,xzgte,My Goodbye Letter to Teavana,rcgold,209,58,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/xzgte/my_goodbye_letter_to_teavana/,"Dear Teavana,

You have lost my business as a lifelong customer. As a loyal customer to Teavana, I was recently insulted by an employee of your store and received the worst customer service I have received in my life. In the past I have loved Teavana for both their service and great tea, but I cannot stand with this company in good faith after what has happened. I will take my business to both TWG and Argo tea. 

I visited the Fox Valley Mall Teavana Store on 08/09/2012 at around 6/7pm. I was used to buying my tea at the Schaumburg, Oak Brook and Chicago stores and was delightfully surprised to see a Teavana in the Fox Valley Mall. My cousin and I entered the store and sampled the teas on display when my first interaction with the employee was him asking me, “Can I get you both a cup of that to walk around in the mall?”. My cousin was unaware of what he meant, thinking the store was offering free tea, but I knew the employee was slyly trying to get us to buy a cup of tea from the tea bar; I politely declined. I then browsed the store and approached the counter. Again the same employee asked me if he should start brewing up a cup for us to walk around the mall with, I declined him again and told him I wanted to purchase loose leaf tea. 

I told him I wanted a Christmas like tea similar to that of Samurai Chai Mate and he then proceeded to bring down two teas and presented each. He told me that popularly a combination blend of both of the teas was always purchased by most customers. He then asked me if I had a bin for the tea, and I told him that I did and had already purchased teas from Teavana in the past. I then inquired about other teas, as I hoped for more teas to be shown to me as most of my Teavana experiences do. He continued by bringing down one more bin.
 
After that he then pressed me for purchasing and asked if I would be buying two canisters of each. I asked him how many ounces of a tea did I have to purchase and he responded most people either buy a full container or half a container; that did not answer my question, it was the beginning to his condescension. He started to scoop the teas and said, “So we’re having a two canister blend of these teas right?”. I stopped him, told him “no” and then told him I would take 2 oz of a White Ayurvedic Chai tea. He then pressed further, asking if I was certain I didn’t want two scoops of the tea, I responded by telling him I only wanted 1. He then again told me that most customers buy an entire canister of the tea so they don’t have to come back for more; once again this was a condescending remark. I told him, that was not a problem for me, and that I did not know if I even liked this tea and by buying one scoop I would thus sample it. He then questioned what I would do with the rest of the space in my canister at home, to which I told him I will be fine. He told me that if I liked the smell of the tea then I more than likely I would enjoy the taste and thus should buy a canister of the tea, and then offered to let me smell the tea again. I told him I was fine and just wanted one scoop. He then looked at me and said, “Really, just one scoop? Not two? Fine”. With that statement I was highly insulted; who are you to look down on me for only necessitating one scoop of tea. He measured the tea out to 2.3oz and sarcastically then asked if that would be okay for him to go over. I told him it was fine.

He then turned to the next tea and said, “So we’ll be having a full canister of this right?”. I told him, “no, that was it”, to which he then asked what I was going to do with my second canister at home? I told him it was still full with the other tea I owned. 

By this point I was rather insulted by the whole charade and felt like leaving the store. I then decided to state my thoughts as he started to process my purchase and told him, “I don’t remember Teavana being this pushy to sell things”. The employee then snidely responded, “I’m being pushy?”. Another employee on the side then responded, “Us pushy? Them’s fighting words” in a joking manner. A third employee stocking goods then looked up to our scenario and said, “The customer is always right”. This is when the main employee looked at me and then snidely said, “I didn’t know $11 was breaking the bank?”. I was then highly insulted and humiliated and looked at my cousin and told the employee, “We’re done here”. To which the employee responded, “Really?!! Fine.” and then poured the tea back into its container. 

This is a completely irresponsible way to treat your customers and because of it, you have lost my business forever. Myself being a marketing profession, this is not how employees are suppose to treat their customers and because of this your brand image has been tarnished. A satisfied customer tells 2-3 other people, but a dissatisfied customer tells about 10 – 20 people. I can only imagine how high that number goes when your employees insult them as well. 

Edit: Thanks for the support! I have also emailed them the link to this Reddit post. Hopefully they respond.

Edit 2: I received an email back from Teavana Customer Service, it read: ""Thank you for reaching out to us about your recent store experience. We would love to connect with you directly about this experience as soon as possible. Would you mind sending me the best contact number to reach you? We would love to speak to you directly about this""

I responded to the email giving them my phone number. Any thoughts? How do you predict they will try to mend the scenario? What do you think they should do?

Update 1: I was called by the overseeing manager of the Great Lakes Region stores who was mortified of this story. The manager apologized profusely and said that this employee did not represent Teavana and was going to be reprimanded and the entire store retrained. My letter had made it all the way up to their corporate office as an issue. Due to my bad experience they've offered to send me a gift card in the mail in hope I will continue to visit their stores or buy their tea online. It would seem that we've made a difference. Thanks for the support and your comments.

I have been a few times, and I noticed that the last time I went, they removed the leaves from the pot, which they didn't used to do. The first thing I always do when I get a pot of tea is remove the infuser so that it doesn't oversteep. I was wondering how I get a second infusion if they dump the leaves. Then I saw this this time. How do they justify $3 for hot water?? That is all it costs them to infuse a second time, hot water. I really like their tea, too, but I will not be going back or buying any more tea from them.

Hello! I'm from Argentina and i really enjoy tea, tisanes and all infusions in general, so i quite often lurk this thread.

It caught my eye how many of you drink Mate, and as i work with tourism and visit the place where it grows and gets processed, i thought you guys might be interested in it.

Some clarifications about stuff: I don't speak english as my mother tongue so you can expect weird grammar and spelling, i didn't take all the pics because i'm guiding the excursions but the students did. Not all the pics were taken on the same trip, i've been doing this for 5 years.

So first things first:

Yerba mate is a tree. Not a tall one, but a moderate tall tree. In the farms they are not that big because the take their leaves pretty much every day.

The natives of this area, the Guaranies, discovered that they could make a tea with the plant, but they had to dried them first. Yerba mate is poisonous if not dried. Not poisonous that you will die, but you will wish to. It will give you stomach cramps, inflamation, diharrea, intestine cramps, incontinence and fever. The natives used to have a leather pouch that was really thin and was attached to their back so while walking in the jungle and under the sun yerba would be dried.

Nowadays we use a different method:

You have to know that making yerba is so cheap, that you don't need to get better technology than this. Of course you can make the process cleaner and have almost no loss, but the amount of cash that you will make after the investment is not worth it.

Yerba grows naturally on the jungle or can be planted in order to be gathered. It's usually plantes in iron (and ferrites) rich soils and it grows really easy. 95% of the production of Yerba in the province of misiones is organic, they don't use any kind of growing factors or even insecticides.
The rach that we usually go is around 2000 acres (800 hectáreas) And has a lot of Tea ([1](http://i.imgur.com/z0ZtL.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/Sbps6.jpg) [3](http://i.imgur.com/x8nSB.jpg)) , pines and of course, Yerba. At the place that i visite, they process around 3 tons of yerba a day (3000kg, or around 6000 pounds).

First yerba is picked and trasported in [trucks](http://i.imgur.com/gAqnu.jpg) ([another pic](http://i.imgur.com/cF6Xe.jpg)) to the facility and [piled up](http://i.imgur.com/6sdTU.jpg).

After this is placed in some [transport belts](http://i.imgur.com/1Iahq.jpg) that will toss it inside of a [hughe tumbler](http://i.imgur.com/Of5FE.jpg) [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/tqt6y.jpg) [pic 3 ](http://i.imgur.com/bjW8O.jpg) [pic 4](http://i.imgur.com/mgA9V.jpg). 

One end of the tumbler is a [Giant Oven](http://i.imgur.com/cxTBc.jpg) [oven 2](http://i.imgur.com/jOjNI.jpg) [oven 3](http://i.imgur.com/XkuZ4.jpg). To dry 1000kg of yerba (2000lbs) they burn around 2 square meters of [wood](http://i.imgur.com/zMPTP.jpg). 

It's really important that the wood is not pine or any wood that will burn with a smell because it will taint the Yerba itself.

The other end of the tumbler is another transport belt to the second oven that has 60 to 80% the temperature from the first one. After this 2nd oven, it gets transported to a 3rd set of [firepits](http://i.imgur.com/XNqnj.jpg) and ovens that have around 40°C (104F) to 50°C (122F) top. It's a 2 stories oven and the yerba goes one way and then comes back on the floor below into what we call ""canchadora"".

[Canchadora](http://i.imgur.com/8d3sU.jpg) is a machine that will separate the [stick from the leaves](http://i.imgur.com/qynT3.jpg) (that's one of the peons from the ranch, he is in charge of the yerba production), ang grind the leaves. The sticks are sold too, because you can have ""yerba con palo"" (with sticks) or ""yerba sin palo"" (without sticks). The main difference is in the intensity of the flavour. In 1kg (2lbs) of yerba con palo, you have a certain amount of leaves and a certain amount of leaves. If you have the same volume of yerba but without the palos, there will be an increase on the volume of leaves in comparision son the flavour will be much intense.

By this time, everything and everyone will be cover with a thick green [powder coat](http://i.imgur.com/8f0Zj.jpg).

Then they bag the yerba in 50kg (100lbs) [bags](http://i.imgur.com/NrRYB.jpg). Each bag is left in storage for at least one year. This process is called ""estacionamiento"" (literally translates to parking, as in car parking) and the sold to the factories that will bag it in the comercial packages. This ranch sells yerba to the 3 main companies in Argentina, so it's kinda funny to know that this bags will be divided in different bags with a 100% price variation because they are selling you the brand.

The market price of one of the white bags (the 50kg ones) is around 40 pesos (10 us dollars).


Once you have you yerba, you should start drinking it.
There's mainly 2 ways of drinking, the mate and the mate cocido.
Mate cocido is the yerba in a bag, like a tea bag. Cocido in spanish means cooked, but also [brew or boil](http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=cocer). You can have a nice cup of green mate drink in the mornings and go to work. 

My grandma used to put one bag in boiling milk, and then put honey and 1 or 2 drops of vanilla essence or extract, i still do this in winter, warms my body and my soul.

The other way is getting a mate (the weird gourd like argentinean water bong thingy).
There is a GORILLION mates. You have wooden, bone, glass, stainless steel, bamboo, dried gourd, aluminium, porcelain, and a big list of etc's.

Then you need a bombilla (straw). it's really important that no matter what material the straw is, the tip should not heat. It acn be a bronce or wood tip because you are going to be zipping nearly boiling water though it and if its metal will burn your lips.

You fill 3/4 parts of the mate with the yerba and you put 95°C water (2003F). If you put boiling water you'll burn the yerba and the mate will be blend very fast. When the yerba starts to float, you take 2 spoons out, put 2 new yerba spoons in and keep drinking. You can have Mate dulce (swett ones) or mate amargo (without sweeteners). I hate sweet mate, my mom puts artificial sweetener on the thermus and i want to bludgeon her with it.

Everyone drinks mate all day here. It's one of the few things that goes across all classes and sectors of our society. Even though you don't drink, you have a mate at home because somebody could show up. 

**Bonus:** Mate myths and traditions.

""Un mate no se le niega a nadie"". If somebody asks you for a mate, you can't say no. If you do, you are the bigges asshole ever.

""Mate corto"". Is when you pour little watter on the mate. The other person doesn't what you to leave their house, so they'll pull short mates 

to make them last longer. My grandma says ""corto como beso de marido"" that translates to ""Short as a husband kiss"" in oposition to a lover's 

or boyfriend.

""Mate Largo"", the oposite from above.

If i can remember more i'll put the here.

**TL;DR:** i'm green inside.

PS: i promise to take pictures of mates, people drinking mates and the yerba shelves in the supermarket.

1325001720.0,104,self.tea,nscxq,Dunno how many of you would be interested in but: I grew up in a tea estate in Sri Lanka (Ceylon),onca32,107,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/nscxq/dunno_how_many_of_you_would_be_interested_in_but/,"I've always thought about doing something like this on reddit. I figured this would be the best place to do so.
My dad owns 2 tea factories in the low country of Sri Lanka (Ill get into this in a sec). One of them is a very small factory that still uses the old British era machines (which are incredible) and another is a medium sized fairly modern factory. Also were shareholders of a large factory.

We dont sell our tea directly to the consumer. Instead, we sell it to the auction where companies like Lipton, Dilmah and Akbar brothers buy it for export. 

There are two main classifications of tea made in Sri Lanka, low country and up country (or high country). Low country is located in- you guessed it- the southern parts of the country where there is less elevation. Interestingly, this results in the tea being stronger. Low country tea is generally favoured by middle eastern countries and Russia, but not so popular in the UK. 


I can write a step by step process of how black tea is made (with, hopefully pics of the factory :D) if you guys are interested.
I hope Im not breaking any rules by posting this here and not IAMA.

**Edit**: Gah! Wall of text, did my best to fix that! 
Ask away!

**Edit 2**: Ok sorry about the delay, I had to steal some pics from friend's facebook! 

I dont have any proper pictures of the machines, since my friends didnt wanna upload them (Ill contact them and get it asap).

Ok so once the Green leaf reaches the factory, its put in 'beds' called dryers. These beds have a layer of mesh that keeps the tea elevated and allows airflow. At each end are massive fans that suck in air and pass it through the leaves.

this is the rear side of the dryer, fans on the other end.

Next is my favourite part,
The tea is then put through a chute directly into a machine called the roller. A roller is like those teapot rides that go around in circles (but its one giant teapot and they're very small rotations). IMO one of the most dangerous machines in the factory. 
http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4716221799_5777bd5e8c.jpg a picture of an old roller (from google)

The tea is put through several cycles of rollers until theyre ready to be ferment in a very damp room.
Once fermented, they're rolled again and then separated according to size. 
You get 4 general sizes. In order of increasing: 1st Dhool, 2nd Dhool, 3rd Dhool and Big bulk.
After this, they're roasted to become black tea. At this point the manager can take a look at the different dhools and determine the grades of tea he can get from each. Also its a good way to evaluate the quality of the leaf early on. 

After this they go through several large cheese grater like machines that separate according to size, and another machine called a 'colour separater' thats incredibly loud.
This is a rather elegant machine (the one in the back). Tea goes to the top of the machine and gets blown by wind to the other end of the machine. It separates the tea according to weight, and thus grade. 
After all that separations is done, you have the different grades.
And they get 'liquored' :D
Heres the album with the few stuff I could get. Ill try get hold of the older factories stuff. The last time I was there I was taking pictures with film (damn uni!)

**Edit3** sorry about the wall of text, Im really bad at formatting.
I found my old camera, hoping it has more stuff. Heres a pic of some tea bushes :D

First, apologies for being the shamelessly self-promoting guy who posts his own tea company, but I wanted to share what I have been working on for a long time! I have always enjoyed reddit as an online community and hope to share my passion with everyone here.


Background information on me - I have been living in China for what is inching closer and closer to a decade, and drinking puer since my first trip to Yunnan in 2005. I recently started a company selling puer from China, stocking what i consider to be good teas. I have a basic philosophy, that if I wouldn't drink it, I won't stock it. The company is called [White 2 Tea](http://www.white2tea.com) , check it out, and please post feedback! I will try to answer any questions as best I can.


Also, I know there are a lot of tea sites around, and it might be tough to trust a new vendor, so here are some hopefully meaningful validations of my puer street cred. Reviews on some puer blogs like [Hobbes](http://half-dipper.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/2007-menghai-fuyuan-yexiangwang.html) and [Jakub](http://jakubtomek.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/2011-taochaju-banna-gu-yun.html) . And, if you are so inclined, I blog about puer/tea at [twodogteablog](http://www.twodogteablog.com) .


Hope you enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday or the weekend, if you are abroad!

And one other thing, for a black friday/Thanksgiving/hello reddit deal, any orders that are over 50 USD before shipping, and are ordered before midnight on Sunday Nov 25th will get a free 2012 Dayi Hongyun 100g cake. It's a good little shu cake, that looks like [this.](http://imgur.com/a/H6Uda)

**tl;dr** I started [this site](http://www.white2tea.com) selling puer direct from China. I love reddit. I will give you a [100g shu cake](http://imgur.com/a/H6Uda) from Menghai if you order over 50 bucks of tea before Sunday.

I think the favored drink by far was vanilla chai with Rum Chata (Vanilla RumChaita). It tasted like cake. It was amazing.

Also tried were chai and rum, Earl Grey infused Gin and tonics, Lapsang Souchong infused Gin and Tonics (which I dubbed the Forest Fire), Earl Grey and scotch (The United Kingdom), Roasted Chestnut tea with Crown Royal Maple, white wine mulled with our local tea store's spiced tea blend (black tea, cinnamon, cloves, some other stuff), red wine mixed with some other spice tea, Lipton with Two Gingers whiskey - but fear not, we've now upgraded him from crappy Lipton to loose tea, and a black tea and mango blend with rum.

We also just tried some of the random teas we picked up before the party from the previously mentioned local tea store. My new favorite being a cherry green tea. 

Then we played Cards Against Humanity and laughed until it hurt.

Thanks a lot for all of your recommendations. I'd have to say that all of the drinks maintained their tea flavor rather well. Everything was just brewed normally, poured into a cofee mug, and then we threw in about a shot worth of alcohol.

If you guys are interested, I'd say definitely give it a shot. We converted a Lipton tea bag drinker to loose leaf teas, found a tea or two a non-tea drinker enjoyed, and the rest of us who already love tea found even more flavors/blends we like with or without alcohol.

1354510592.0,73,self.tea,146ot4,How my love for coffee led me to switch to tea,Beelzebubba,102,29,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/146ot4/how_my_love_for_coffee_led_me_to_switch_to_tea/,"It all started sometime around 1985, in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  George Howell had opened The Coffee Connection, a coffee and tea shop, that sold really great quality stuff.  You could sit down and get a nice varietal coffee, properly roasted, and brewed in an individual press pot at your table.  Or a good quality loose leaf tea - I remember I had my first Keemun there.  I’m drinking a Keemun as I write this, and it brings me back to the flavor of that first cup in 1985, along with the fantastic sour cream poppy seed cake.  But I digress.

Howell was selling Sumtatran coffee, and Ethiopian, and Kenyan, and Costa Rican, and on and on and on.  In the land of Dunkin Donuts, this was revolutionary to my adolescent taste buds.  The tea was good too, but the coffee - I was hooked.  

Years went by, and the Coffee Connection was closed, replaced by a Starbucks.  In the 1990s, I learned to buy my coffee from Peet’s, which had opened down the street, or from the 1369 Coffeehouse in Central Square, which had really excellent stuff.  I mostly drank my coffee at home, brewed in a French press.  I was a big fan of Sumatran, eventually discovered Indian coffee from Mysore, which at the time was like the best Sumatran I’d ever had, except a little more so.  

One day, my quest for variety and quality in coffee led me to try home-roasting.  I ordered a roaster and beans from Sweet Maria’s, and began exploring Yemeni coffees, and Monsooned Malabar, and funky aged Java, and delicate, almost sweet Panamanian and Costa Rican coffees.  Heaven.  

Alas, these days would not, could not last.  The biggest problem with home roasting is that the available roasters simply aren’t very big.  You need to be roasting coffee every day or two to keep up with even a single individual’s demands.  Marriage challenged my capacity.  Occasional house guests would completely overwhelm me, and I would have to (gasp) buy coffee.  Also, my wife’s tastes, and those of her parents (who frequently stayed with us for long stretches in those days) ran towards filter-brewed Melitta coffee.  So began the dark years.  

Some time passed, and last year I realized that my wife and I were living rather different schedules in the mornings.  My wife needed to be at work earlier than me, and often left the house before I got out of bed.  By the time I was ready for coffee, the pot she had made would have gone cold, and I would need to microwave it.  If I took it with me in a to-go cup, it would invariably be lukewarm for my drive to work.  This was madness.  I hatched a plan.  

I bought a new French press.  My old one had disappeared at some point, in favor of a Bodum Santos vacuum pot that was fun to use, but a little inconvenient, and too big for my intended purpose.  I plugged in my trusty coffee roaster, and roasted up some nice Sumatran to a good “full city” roast.  A couple days later, after letting the coffee “gas off”, I was ready to have a cup.  It was perfect.  Best coffee I’d had in years.  

So, every couple days for the next several weeks, I roasted some coffee.  It scared the cats, and I had to disable a smoke alarm, but I was drinking real, delicious coffee again.  Pure happiness.

Still, the constant roasting was a pain in the butt.  Also, I thought, maybe it was time for me to buy a good quality burr grinder.  Something with a timer to allow me to measure my dose accurately.  Then one day, I didn’t have any coffee ready to brew.  That night, I went to one of my favorite shops and bought some Sumatran.  On a whim, I decided to buy a little loose tea as well - why not, that works well in a French press, and I haven’t had a nice cup of tea in a while.  

Well, the Sumatran wasn’t all that great, frankly.  Over-roasted.  Starbucks really seems to have influenced things in the last several years to the point that it’s hard to find anything lighter than French roast, even in another shop.  

After I ran out of that bag of coffee, I started alternating between the canned Melitta that my wife likes, and the tea I had bought.  It was a decent English Breakfast, nothing mind-blowing.  But the convenience was refreshing.  

I went to Cardullo’s in Harvard Square, a specialty foods shop that caters to an international clientele looking for favorite items from home.  They have a pretty good selection of tea.  I got a tin of Hediard, and a tin of Taylor’s.  These were better (though a little pricey).  I started drinking tea every morning.  I began reading r/Tea.  

Then I discovered Upton Tea.  Right in my own home state of Massachusetts, a quality tea importer with a pretty good selection.  I ordered a tin of Assam, and several samples of various breakfast blends, and a few others.  My order arrived the very next day.  I was pleasantly shocked.

Fast forward a little further, and I find that I have given up coffee almost completely.  I’m enjoying a strong Crush-Tear-Curl Assam most mornings, and have a staggering variety of tea samples at work, all of which I’m enjoying greatly.  Compared to coffee, tea is more convenient, lasts longer, easier to measure, doesn’t leave a nasty taste in my mouth when I’m done drinking it, encompasses a broader range of styles and flavor, and somehow is a bit more satisfying.  

TLDR; good coffee is a fucking pain in the ass, but good tea is good.",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,False,,,True,t3_146ot4,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/146ot4/how_my_love_for_coffee_led_me_to_switch_to_tea/,

Firstly, I apologize if this is not the forum to let you all know about my new tea company... its been a couple months in the building and I'd thought you all might enjoy it. If not, downvote away! :)

First off, I’d like to tell you all a little about myself. I am a university student located in Montreal and have always have the dream and passion to open up a store about something that has always been close to me. I think we can all guess that its tea :) I had the privilege to be able to take the past couple months off and make this a reality.

The website is http://www.blendstea.com and I’d love any feedback/criticism/questions/comments from you all. Obviously, it wouldn’t be fair for me to ask for this without providing you a little something-something in return. Feel free to use the coupon code “REDDIT_LOVE” on checkout for 15% discount on everything(and yes, this also stacks with the save 15% when you buy 2 pouches of the same tea). Thanks redditors, you're the best!


**edit 5: Thank you all SO much for your feedback and insight - Ill be plugging away for the next couple of days to try and implement all your great ideas. Ill also be working on providing you all sampler packs and a line of unflavored teas. Ill let you all know when its ready!**",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,True,,,True,t3_kegz5,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/kegz5/a_tea_company_i_just_launched/,

I used to drink coffee like it was water, easily putting down an entire extra-large iced coffee or several cups of regular on the weekends. 

It finally occurred to my dumbass that the reason I had indigestion, heartburn, a low-appetite and resulting anxiety was probably related to the gallon of acid I was mainlining every morning. 

So a few weeks ago I switched to drinking tea and the difference has been amazing. I feel better, have a better appetite, and tea seems to dehydrate me less than coffee. I really like black tea and chai, green tea is ok, I haven't really tried earl gray, and I just tried Pur-Eh which is... not for me... 

I've been drinking Tazo Awake Black Tea and Tazo Chai, both of which I really like, but I think the Chai could use a bit more spice. An orange-flavored black tea sounds like it would be delicious but I haven't really found one. 

I have a little basket for loose tea, so I'm open to that idea for my first cup, but I usually make my 2nd in the office so I'd really love to hear some suggestions on pre-bagged too. 

I'd also love to just hear some general tips and tricks to making a great cup. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,False,,,True,t3_1b8wb0,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1b8wb0/recently_sacrificed_my_beloved_coffee_for_tea_in/,

You know, if I wanted to go through the sales process of purchasing a new car, I would visit a car lot.  For that reason I won't be making anymore trips into your store.  I am tired of being harassed and lied to in order to purchase items that I don't need from some High school senior claiming to be a ""wellness expert"" that claims to know everything under the sun regarding tea and homeopathic wellness.  For some reason your employees are terrible at math and gauging weight &amp; measurements. This seems to happen every time I enter your store.  I tell the employee what I am looking for and how much I want.  Everytime they purposely overfill the bag.  Then, when I remind then of the quantity I want, rather than just adjusting the bag to that quantity, they simpy frustrate you by removing small amounts at a time until you simply give up under the assumption that you are dealing with a complete retard.  Are your employees really this inept or is it that you promote such hostile working environment, that they simply don't care about the customer?  Like I said, either way I won't be back.  There are plenty of other alternative that don't come with the extra bullshit. You can be certain this I will be sharing my experiencing with other friends and family members as I would feel bad if they fell victim to these practices knowing I could have helped them avoid it.

You will need:  
  * either 1 tsp of dried English Breakfast whole leaf tea, or 1 English Breakfast tea bag.  
  * either 1 tsp of fresh Holy Basil (also called Tulsi) or 1 tea bag (I found Tulsi tea bags in a Vitamin Shoppe, but they can also be found at Indian grocery stores if you are so fortunate)  
  * Fennel seeds (as much as you like, usually I put in 1/4 to 1/2 tsp)  
  * 1 cup of water  
  * 1/2 cup of milk  

Pour the water into a saucepan (or easy-to-clean tea kettle) and bring it to a boil. Add your Holy Basil and Fennel and allow to boil until water is dark green, about 3-5 minutes. Add your tea, boil for about 1 minute. Add milk, bring to a boil, then take the pot of the heat and remove the infusion balls (or tea bags). Pour into a mug, through a strainer if needed.

So, at my local coffeeshop that I work at, I've been assigned to be in charge of everything relating to tea, ordering it, having a knowledge base, and coming up with a monthly ""Special-Tea"" drink.

The problem that I've already run into is my limited creativity with the special drinks. I've been doing a lot of iced stuff since it's nice and hot outside, but so far I've only really come up with an Arnold Palmer and a Pomegranate Green Tea with strawberry and vanilla. The drinks are good, they work, but I'm running out of ideas fast, and was wondering if you guys had any particularly interesting drinks up your sleeve.

I should probably say that my iced tea choices are somewhat limited, to Classic Black (pretty much just Assam), coconut black tea, pomegranate green tea, gunpowder, hibiscus herbal, and a mint/citrus herbal. As for what I can mix, I've got the whole coffeeshop's inventory at my disposal, so lemonade, limeade, flavored syrups, milk, etc.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. :&gt;",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,False,,,True,t3_x7urs,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/x7urs/tea_cocktails/,

Edit 2: I saw someone post a question about AliSan, LiSan, DongDing, and their meanings, but I can't find it so I'll answer it here.

AliSan and LiSan are mountains; they are the two most famous tea producing region in Taiwan.  

Dong Ding is also a tea producing region, but now it's also considered a style of tea manufacturing (firing the tea at a higher temperature to caramelize the sugars and having a longer oxidization process).  

Oriental Beauty is a style of tea making with a really cool story behind it.  Way back in the 19th century (maybe even earlier!) Taiwanese tea farmers noticed that their summer crops would be ravaged by the tea jassid, whose bite oxidizes the leaves and adds a sweet note to the teas flavor profile.  As a result, they would refuse to sell summer harvests to the public and drink it themselves as they believed it was an inferior product.  

When British tea merchants noticed the Taiwanese farmers holding onto this product, they automatically assumed the farmers were holding onto the best product for themselves.  When the British tried to purchase the tea, the farmers would refuse to sell it.  Finally after much pushback, the Taiwanese farmers threw out some ridiculously high number thinking the British would balk at the price.  But the British bought tons of it!  And brought it back to Queen Elizabeth II, saying it was the best tea, they've ever had.  

So Oriental Beauty is also called ""Braggarts tea"" named for the Taiwanese farmers who boasted they could turn trash into fortunes.",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,1341558860.0,,,True,t3_ofzby,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/ofzby/hey_rtea_my_family_has_3_tea_estates_around_the/,

I've been noticing this with all of the looseleaf tea I've brewed, and I'm not sure if it is normal.

""Just rinse your tea leaves for a quick 30 seconds, and that will naturally decaffeinate your brew.""  

[HERE](http://www2.hcmuaf.edu.vn/data/lhquang/file/Tea1/Tea%20preparation%20and%20its%20influence%20on%20methylxanthine.pdf) is the study that debunks the urban legend.
Share it around the next time it pops up.  


If that's a bit TL;DR, here's the breakdown.

To be ""decaffeinated,"" tea needs to lose at the very least 80% of it's caffeine.  
Instead, what you see is this...

30 seconds: -9% caffeine

1 minute: -18%

2 minutes: -34%

3 minutes: -48%

4 minutes: -60%

5 minutes: -69%

10 minutes: -92%

15 minutes: -100%


CONCLUSION: If you want to decaffeinate your tea, either
1) Brew for 8-10 minutes.  Throw out the brew.  Resteep to taste.  OR
2) Drink an herbal that doesn't have any caffeine.  That includes chocolate.


CHA DAO also has a [nice discussion](http://chadao.blogspot.com/2008/02/caffeine-and-tea-myth-and-reality.html) of this study (Hicks et al) and a previous (Spiro et al).

**EDIT:** to plug the [r/Tea FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/tea).  Links to Chadao and elmwoodinn.com's take on the subject are great additional reading.

I find that I can drink it at any hour of the day. I'm always on the lookout for different brands to try and I'd like to know what the reddit tea community suggests. For reference, here are the brands that I've tried:

* **Rishi Earl Grey Supreme** (by far the best I've had)
* **Twinings Earl Grey - Bagged** (I was a little disappointed especially given the twinings name. I did purchase loose leaf and it just arrived so I can't wait to try it out)
* **Tazo Earl Grey - Bagged** (Surprisingly not that bad. I wouldn't mind buying a box to tide me over till I get something better)
* **Harney &amp; Sons Earl Grey Supreme** (It was quite good. I had it in a pyramid bag but with full leaves. I would be interested in purchasing a proper batch)
* **Adagio Earl Grey Bravo** (Awful. I'm not sure if it's the blue cornflowers that were added or the fact that there was a synthetic overload of bergamont flavoring... it just did not sit well with me.)

I've had many other brands but the names slip my mind. I'd love to hear what I should try next. If possible, I'd prefer loose leaf. For what it's worth, I drink earl grey straight.

* Gyokuro and Sencha tea leaves
* One 15$ coffee mate coffee grinder
* An infusor basket repurposed as a sifter
* A lack of common sense

**The Procedure**

Simple: Add two teaspoons of tea to the grinder, grind. Sift finely ground powder through a mesh filter and into a container/cup.

**The Results**

I actually produced two distinct powders. One was neon green and had the fine, sticky consistency of flour. This particular powder tended to get kicked up into the lid of the grinder, where it stuck to the walls.

The second powder tended to collect on the bottom. It was dark green, with a texture like sugar and a taste as bitter as unsweetened cocoa powder. A bit of the pretty, fine powder tended to collect underneath this layer, caked to the bottom.

I'm not sure if these two powders come from different parts of the leaf (IE, if there are stems involved) or if the brighter particles are simply ground to a finer consistency.

**The Drink**

Dark green, frothy when whisked, with a full bodied flavor and a sharp astringency. Separating the bright, fine powder from the coarse/dark powder seems to yield a better drink, but it's remarkably tedious to do so. I settle for a mix of the two.

**Conclusion**

Delicious to a confidence of 3-sigma. Makes a great 'matcha' latte, 8 oz water with 2 tsp of ground tea, add 8 oz foamed milk, profit. Sweeten to taste if you do not care about dishonoring your family. 

**Complications**

It takes several minutes to grind tea to a fine powder. The tea particles don't come out of the grinder easily, so if you're a coffee nerd you probably shouldn't do this with your primary grinder, unless you want to add a modicum of class to that barbarian's drink. 

The darker, grittier particles are a little coarse and settle on the bottom of the cup. The first 15~oz of my 16oz mug are silky smooth. The last few sips are thick and gritty. The answer is most likely to buy a better grinder, but a cheapo grinder gets the job done if you don't mind a little debris in the bottom of your cup.

The finer particles get airborn and will dust your counter in green. The upside is it smells amazing.

**tl;dr:** Put tea leaves in coffee grinder, everything went better than expected, 8/10 would recommend, an expensive grinder would surely do much better. ",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,False,,,True,t3_14wnca,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/14wnca/tea_experiment_ghetto_matcha/,

We all love tea, and I'm sure most of us would love to try something new. Tea should also be cheap to ship.

Would others on /r/tea be interested in doing a gift exchange here? The folks over at RedditGifts have offered to help other subreddits to create their own gift exchanges.

We could also do it more simply by people replying to comments to pair themselves and trading addresses by PM. That way, if people prefer certain types of tea (only herbal, only Chinese, etc.) they can pick a counterpart with similar interests.

We're a small community, so just trying to gauge interest for this idea :)

However with the interest I feel like to a certain extent people doesn't seem to know where to get started, despite the fact that there's a lot of information out there. I'm still quite the newbie, so I won't write too much and simply try to provide information. Hopefully this post will help everyone else who is in a similar boat as me get started :)

Have fun!

[Bearsblog](http://puerh.blogspot.com/) is /u/bearsx3's blog on puerh. He's one of the most knowledgeable people when it comes to puerh in the west. He has a nice [Getting Started](http://puerh.blogspot.com/p/new-to-puer.html) guide, and a [very very helpful guide](http://puerh.blogspot.com/p/puer-by-appearance-types-storage.html) on how to tell puerh apart by the type of storage, which gives you a very basic run down on how storage and aging methods affects the flavor of the tea.

The blog [Listening to Leaves](http://listeningtoleaves.blogspot.com/) has an [excellent guide](http://listeningtoleaves.blogspot.com/2012/03/puerh-faq-and-resource-guide-for.html) on getting started with puerh. It also has a [post regarding huigan](http://www.listeningtoleaves.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-is-hui-gan.html), which is one of the things to look for while drinking puerhs.

[Wikicha](http://wikicha.com/index.php/Puerh) also has a very good section on Puerh. [Bana](http://banateacompany.com/pages/mastery.html) also has a very good basic run down puerhs. 

And of course, the [quintessential blog](http://www.marshaln.com/) run by MarshalN, has a lot of information and opinions on puerh scattered throughout his blog.

Now as for vendors...

[Bana Tea Company](http://banateacompany.com/) is a company run by Linda Louie, who learned under Vesper Chan of Best Tea House. They have some very good teas, and even sampler sets to help you get started.

[Yunnan Sourcing](http://www.yunnansourcing.com/store/) likely needs no introduction, since it has hundreds and hundreds of cakes for sale, many of them available as samples. 

[Hou De Asian Art &amp; Fine Teas](http://houdeasianart.com/) is also a very reputable vendor. 

[Sample Tea](http://www.sampletea.com/) is an excellent source for samples of many many different types of puerhs. They also sell quite a number of yixing clay pots. 

[Origintea](http://origintea.net/) is a Taiwan based operation, so they have some labels that you can only get from Taiwan.

[Essence of Tea](http://www.essenceoftea.co.uk/) is another quite famous vendor, a bit on the pricey end, however.

[Tea Urchin](http://teaurchin.com/) is also a very good source. They also have a pretty awesome blog.

[White2Tea](http://www.white2tea.com/) is a shop run by /u/Dog22222. Their Philosophy behind the shop can be found [here](http://www.teachat.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&amp;t=17956)

Turning it over it had a big gaping hole on the bottom.  ""Yup,""  I thought ""Just a decoration.""

The auction catalog described it as a bottom-loading Yixing pot.  This was obviously preposterous as there is no room for leaf -- if you look in the hole in the bottom all you see is a narrow tube of clay.  I nearly dismissed it entirely.

Now I've heard of several pot makers who create Yixing pots with a hole on the bottom, where you cover a hole on the top to prevent the tea from pouring out until you are ready, much like covering the end of a straw with your finger to keep soda from coming out the bottom.  This was obviously not one of these pots -- the bottom hole was too big and there was no lid for loading leaf.  Plus those special pots had no spout as the hole on the bottom acts as the spout.

Then as I was waiting through the first items of the auction it occurred to me:  what if the tube on the bottom was like a siphon, or at least a block to prevent tea from pouring out?  Conceivably you could infuse the tea leaf in another pot, pour it into the tube on the bottom, flip the pot over quickly, and voila!  The tea would stay inside until you were ready to pour.

I bought it on a whim and took it home to try it out.  Sure enough it works exactly as I hypothesized!  It even holds more tea than I expected.  I thought you would only be able to fill it halfway before it would spill out the tube again, but it holds nearly it's full volume without spilling.  It even pours smoothly!

Obviously the key problem with this design is ensuring the inside is clean and does not become moldy.  I'm going to pour a number of boiling pots of water through it before use, even though my test pours of warm water had no unpleasant odors.

So, has anyone else ever run across this design of pot before?  Any idea what it is called?",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,1366049102.0,,,True,t3_1cegdr,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1cegdr/an_unusual_yixingstyle_pot_with_no_top_opening/,

1. I'm going to structure my reviews in a similar fashion to those from /r/Scotch.  I like that style of review and I hope to start a trend towards them here.

2. I am not affiliated with New Mexico Tea company, but they were my local tea shop and remain my main source for tea.  Many of my links will be to them.

3. I don't have a decent camera, so pictures will be lacking (sorry!).

All that said, on with the show.

**[Cream Earl Grey](https://www.nmteaco.com/Cream-Earl-Grey_p_137.html)**

* Ingredients: Black tea, cornflower petals, bergamot oil, and natural flavors

* Dry scent: A non-artificial vanilla is the primary scent with mild citrus undertones.  It is hard to describe the difference between artificial and natural vanilla scents in any other way than natural vanilla smells far less harsh than even vanilla extract.

* My brewing method: 1 tsp. of tea was added to my [FORLIFE tea infuser](http://www.forlifedesign.com/shop/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=12_9) in a sixteen ounce mug.  Boiling (212 deg.) water was added and the tea was left to brew for five minutes with occasional agitation.  I drink all my tea 'black', so no cream or sugar was added.

* Colour: A dark amber bordering on brown.  (I generally don't comment of the colour of the dry leaves themselves, but I must say that the purple corn flowers are lovely against the black Earl Grey tea.)

* Nose: As with the dry tea, the final product smells pleasantly of vanilla and citrus.  In addition, a slight floral undertone is present.  

* Body: A full bodied tea with medium-high astringency.  The 'creaminess' of the tea is very noticeable as it coats your mouth much like a tea with a bit of cream would.  If I didn't know better, I'd be willing to believe that there were a bit of cream in the brew.

* Palate: Vanilla, citrus dominate the palate with a bit of cream slight sweetness in the background.

* Finish: Citrus dominates the finish.  Surprisingly only a little black tea flavor lingers on the tongue.

* Summary: This tea is a must try for people who like sweet and creamy teas, but don't want to add the calories of adding sugar or cream.  I must say that I prefer teas that have more of a tea flavor to them where this tea is dominated by vanilla and, to a far lesser extent, bergamot.  That said, Cream Earl Grey is very pleasant, easy to drink, and is something that I get a craving for from time to time.  It would have been easy for this tea to taste medicinal had the balance between citrus and vanilla (or, god forbid, fake vanilla) been even slightly off, but this tea manages to be well balanced and fulfilling.  

* Pass or buy: Buy

So, do people like these sort of reviews here?  Would you like to see more of them?  On /r/Scotch people tend to post numerical scores, but I'm not terribly comfortable doing that sort of review.

I pushed forward, letting the boiling water cool and dumping the loose tea and water in the Ingenuitea cup with abandon. After letting it seep for the recommended time I put the tea into a giant mug. 

The first sip was so amazing! Having only had herbal infusions my whole life, (and not knowing anything about seeping time) I was expecting something a little bitter and requiring honey.

I put quotes around gifts, for two reasons.  One, the teas are presented to me as ""My relative X gave this to me.  I don't really like it, but I'm sure you will because you like tea"".  Two, the teas are god awful.  This year has gotten an early start.  So far I've gotten two teas, a handful (about 10) of tea bags which are supposedly a green tea (tastes a bit like boiled cardboard with salt when steeped) and an opened bag (gifter had to try it out of course) of 'German' Jager tea.  The latter is by far the worst offender.  Though it is looseleaf, it smells terrible and tastes worse; it is a mixture of nutmeg (lots and lots of it), juniper berry flavored chips (I have no idea what these are made of), some sort of powdered fruit juice (it tastes like 'red' Americans will know what I mean), and some sort of food coloring to make the final product a bright red color.

So, that's two so far, I'm sure there will be more.  Last year, I had a record five re-gift teas vs one actual present tea (which was quite good).  Do coffee drinkers have to deal with this?

**Edit:**  I'd like to point out two things.  First, I'm not an awful person and I never act ungraciously about their gifts.  I just figured that people would empathize with my plight.  Second, I don't mind *gifts*, but I do object to opened and used things in general.  I might be off-base with those one, but I'd find it weird if someone offered me an opened and used box of cookies or something too.

1362203641.0,47,self.tea,19ie7y,I ended up with free tea from this subreddit so I figured I'd make a post saying thanks,orangejulius,57,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/19ie7y/i_ended_up_with_free_tea_from_this_subreddit_so_i/,"I made one lame post about automoderator in a thread (complaining) about adagio tea and a representative asked for my address and sent me a couple boxes of tea with a nice handwritten letter saying hello.  It was really lovely, and the tea samples are pretty damn good.  

Anyway, no other subreddit has ever sent me goodies before for making a post so I figured I'd say thanks to the community for setting the stage for lively discussion and attracting vendors who seem motivated to win over business constructively.  

I mod a couple of law related subs and no one has ever approached any of my regulars in such a way (to my knowledge) and seem hell bent on spamming rather than winning people over.  So, kudos to you guys.  

On a completely different note, my friend in china sent me several pounds of pu-erh tea and an amazing tea set.  I have no idea how to properly brew tea, but the FAQ here is a pretty good guide.  :)",,False,self,t5_2qq5e,False,,,True,t3_19ie7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/19ie7y/i_ended_up_with_free_tea_from_this_subreddit_so_i/,
