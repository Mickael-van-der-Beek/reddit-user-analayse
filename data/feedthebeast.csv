1374068095.0,400,self.feedthebeast,1ihg51,We need to talk about the behavior of modders.,Gerhard2202,501,101,567,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ihg51/we_need_to_talk_about_the_behavior_of_modders/,"The recent Gregtech / Tinker's Construct fiasco, plus all the issues with Tekkit / Forestry, Tekkit / Gregtech, Gregtech messing with other mods, other mods reverting Vanilla changes made by Greg, et cetera have shown that there's just too much animosity between modders. In a world where things like Tekkit, Feed the Beast, private modpacks, and just a general interest in the usage of many mods all together, we can't have modders who do this kind of stuff.

**We are all here to play Minecraft.** That's the big thing that a lot of people are forgetting. If somebody installs Gregtech, that means he's signing up for the greater difficulty of doing things manually and the significantly slower ride to the top. That's okay. If somebody installs Tinker's Construct, he is *also* signing up for something which has a significantly better tool creation process than that of vanilla. That is also okay. If somebody installs both, that means they want to have really awesome tools - eventually, seeing as Gregtech delays access to the Nether - while keeping the rigid progression and massive infrastructure required to play Gregtech.

There is no need to hate on mods. Some people may think that Tinker's Construct is OP for the costs involved. If so, those people won't use Tinker's Construct. Other people may think that Gregtech is just a bunch of tedium, rather than progression and difficulty, and those people are welcome to *not* use Gregtech.

**On mDiyo reverting the wooden planks change:** A player who signs up for Gregtech is a player who knows that things are going to be harder and that more tools and infrastructure are going to be required to do well. If that player is okay with that, then he's likely able to adjust to the wooden planks change, and perhaps enjoy the small dynamic it adds to the game. There is no need to revert it.

**On Greg's retaliation:** It's not okay to hamper the experience of players who just happen to want to play Minecraft with both Tinker's Construct and Gregtech installed, no matter how one may feel about mDiyo. The right thing to do is *talk to mDiyo* about it and see if there's not something that can be worked out. Turning your mod into malware is just not something that should be done.

We've had this in the past. We don't need it. Mods exist to contribute a unique experience that wasn't there before in Minecraft. Let players build their own experience with the mods they want. mDiyo, if that means somebody installs a mod with a nerfed wood recipe, then by all means let the wood be nerfed. Greg, if somebody wants world-devouring hammers built from ardite, redstone, and circuitry, by all means let that mods function alongside yours.

**I'm not the only one who is sick and tired.** RedPower delays, Tekkit drama, Tekkit VS FTB, Gregtech and the nether drama, Gregtech v. Tinker's Construct, Forestry world-destroying bees... It needs to stop.

Modders need to drop their egos and look at people like power crystals or jakj. power crystals lets any modpack use his mod, source code is available, releases beta builds, links to contacting him and the IRC he frequents, a small, unobtrusive donation link, and he doesn't even route you through AdFly to download his mods. Jakj has created an interesting competitor to Soul Shards designed to provide an alternate means that doesn't require grinding, and a feature-rich alternative to RedPower frames. Both are free to download, fork from, use in modpacks, direct download, etc. Hell, he put multiple sets of community created textures for his mod built into the mod with a config to select which one you want.

**TL;DR:** I'd rather you read it, you cared enough to click on the thread, but - mDiyo v. Greg was extremely stupid, this shit has happened before, modders need to stop and let players play mods how they want to play, people need to be more like jakj and powercrystals and not behave the way Greg and mDiyo did.

Edit - PS: If you, as a modder, insist on having worthless code in your mod that only does something because you don't like something another modder did, can you not ruin the game for innocent players and instead do something harmless like the Pumpkin of Shame? I'd rather see a prank war between modders doing things like the Pumpkin instead of crashing because I had two mods that intentionally hate each other installed.

Edit 2 - Didn't expect this thread to balloon as quickly as it did, garnering even a quick (albeit negative) response from even Sengir. I do apologize to any modders that I have have ""called out"" in this thread, such as Sengir and the Vindictive Bees incident. The intent was not to attack modders who have done this kind of thing in the past, but to point out that situations like mDiyo v. Greg happen all too often.

1356994759.0,274,self.feedthebeast,15qvzw,How to use NEI (ie how to save time with the advanced features of NEI). [x-post from r/mindcrack],iluvredwall,313,39,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/15qvzw/how_to_use_nei_ie_how_to_save_time_with_the/,"I was a bit tired of watching the Mindcrackers spend half of each episode crafting items, so I decided to take a couple minutes and make this post to teach people how to effectively use NEI (Not Enough Items--not to be confused with TMI (Too Many Items)). Hopefully some of the Mindcrackers read this, and it saves everyone a bunch of time and frustration. Some of these features aren't actually documented anywhere but the NEI changelog. The details on the NEI minecraftforum thread are horribly outdated.

This is a large wall of text, but if you use NEI often it'll probably save your more time than it wastes. I won't bother with the obvious features (eg R and U for recipes).

First, the question marks that show up when looking up recipies. They only show up when you're in a gui that can create the item. (Recipes that require a crafting table will have question marks when you view the recipe from a crafting table, those that use furnaces will have them in furnaces, etc.) Most people already know about the first feature, but the second might blow some minds.

* Left click a question mark to show an overlay of the recipe on the gui.
* Shift-left click the question mark in a crafting table, and NEI will autofill the gui with the recipe using whatever items are in your inventory.

In the spirit of the IC wiki, HAYO! (NOTE: the latter only works inside crafting tables.)

Next, the item pane on the right. If you're tired of seeing all the items or are only dealing with a couple mods, you can left click the Item Subsets bar at the top to get a popup of a bunch of categories of items.

* Left click any item or subset to make it shown.
* Right click any item or subset to make it hidden.
* Double-left click any item or subset to show only that.
* Shift-right click any subset to search for items of that subset (uses the search bar; doesn't actually change your shown/hidden items).
* The Mod subset includes subsets of all mod items sorted by mod.
* The Creative tabs subset has each creative mode tab in its own subset. (Functionally similar to the Mod subset, but has subsets for vanilla items, extra subsets for some mods, and lacks some mod subsets.)

The scrolling is a bit wonky sometimes, particularly with the Mod subset. If you need to scroll through the mods, I'd recommend hovering over the Mod subset itself so you don't show any of the sub-subsets. (That sentence makes more sense after you try it.)

Now, if you right click the Item Subsets bar, you see that you can access seven saved hide/show configs.

* Left click an empty slot to save the current config.
* Left click a saved config to use it.
* Right click any slot to rename it.
* Left click the X next to a saved config to delete it.

Honestly, I find the item subsets much more useful when you can use cheat mode, but they're not entirely useless in recipe mode either. Also, some of the items tend not to save their hidden/shown state too well. I haven't figured out a good way to deal with this yet, other than ""Don't look directly at the bugs!""

The rest of these are miscellaneous features in no particular order. I've bolded the relevant actions to make this slightly easier to read. I have no idea if it helps.

* Press **Backspace** (can be rebound under NEI options&gt;controls) to go back a recipe.
* If the item switching in recipes starts giving you a headache, hold **shift** to stop it. (Item switching meaning the recipe changing once every second with a different type of wood/dye/ore/circuit-chipset-gate.
* In the NEI options menu, you can enable **highlight tips** to see the name of whatever block your selection box is around. (ie the block that you would break if you left clicked.)
* **Right click** the output while crafting to pick up as many of the result as you can. (It's like shift clicking, but limited to a stack, and you pick up what you craft instead of having it go straight into your inventory.)
* Hold **Q and click** on an item in an inventory to drop the item on the floor. (Inventory tweaks has the same action bound to the same shortcut.)
* **Scroll up** while hovering over an item in an inventory to effectively shift click one item at a time. (This is so much more amazing than it sounds, and it only gets better.)
* **Scroll down** while hovering over an item in an inventory to fill it with an item from another inventory. (If you have planks in your inventory but need a couple more, just open a chest with planks, hover over the planks in your inventory, and scroll down! Fumbling with left and right clicks is for noobs!)
* When you place an item into an inventory, hold **shift** to move all items of the same type to that inventory. (ie. left click to pick up item, start holding shift, left click to place item into another inventory. All of that type of item from the first inventory will move into the second one. This doesn't work if you place the item into the same inventory that you took it out of. Inventory Tweaks has a similar function that works better (when it does work; some of the shortcuts are a bit buggy atm.), and the newest update of the Mindcrack pack has InvTweaks, so I don't think this is too useful.)
* **Double click** the search bar at the bottom to search inventories as well as the items pane. Yellow searches inventories as well as the items pane on the right, and gray searches only the items pane. With inventory search enabled, all items that don't match the search query are grayed out. (No more missing that one stack of iron you left in a random chest. Again, HAYO!)
* **Right click** the search bar at the bottom to clear it and select it. (Almost infinitely faster than spamming backspace.)
* You can use regex in the NEI search. Except nobody seems to actually know what regex is, nevermind how to use it, so that's fantastic. [Here](http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/regex.htm)'s a link if you want to learn about it, and [here](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)'s another. 
* Under NEI options&gt;NEIPlugins options&gt;Tooltip options, you can enable or disable the **fuel tooltips**. I guess this was worth mentioning. They're annoying when they're not useful :P.
* Press **page up/down** (can be rebound) or use the **scroll wheel** if you're tired of clicking the Next and Previous buttons on the item panel. (The scrolling only works if your cursor is over the item panel.)

The scrolling directions when you hover over items can be a bit unintuitive, but if you have a enough items in a stack, you should be able to just scroll the other way to fix your incorrect scrolling. Also, the scrolling thing only works if NEI is shown and enabled. Not an issue if you constantly have NEI shown and enabled, as most of the Mindcrackers do. All the other shortcuts work fine though. (I'm fairly certain there's only five other people who actually know about/use the scrolling, so it's doesn't have that high of a priority as far as the bugs list goes. It's my favorite feature of the mod though, other than maybe creative+ (which doesn't matter if you're playing survival).)

If you like these sort of small time-saving tweaks, you should check out [Inventory Tweaks](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/323444-146-inventory-tweaks-146-unofficial-nov-24/) and [Mouse Tweaks](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1518185-145-146-sspsmp-mouse-tweaks-beta-4/). The latter is lesser known (and currently in beta), but pretty much just as useful as the former.

Also, my even stacks (autodistribute) code is now in the version of InvTweaks in the FTB packs, and hopefully it saves everyone a ton of left/right click spam while crafting circuits/bread. (Middle click in a crafting table to distribute items across all stacks. For example, if you have two stacks of 1 cobble and a stack of 64, you'll end up with 3 stacks of 22 cobble. It's amazingly useful if your recipe involves an odd number (ie not a power of 2) of an item.)

1364620986.0,258,self.feedthebeast,1baf3f,[Mystcraft] I dug around in the code and learned a lot about instability.,CoughSyrup,290,32,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1baf3f/mystcraft_i_dug_around_in_the_code_and_learned_a/,"I've been getting into mystcraft lately, as I don't have a ton of resources and it's really easy to get into. The only problem is that every age I write has instability. I know I'm missing some essentials according to the mystcraft wiki (like a moon symbol), but I wanted to know what was actually going on. So I decompiled some of the code, and here's what I found.

Each age has a stability score. The more negative a number is, the more instability that will be added. Likewise, the more positive a number is, the more stability will be added.  
When you're writing an age, the following symbols will affect from your stability:

| Symbol | Stability |
|-----|-----|
| Dense Ores | -650 |
| Accelerated | -250 |
| Tendrils w/ ore modifier | -100 |
| Charged | +25 |
| Explosions | +25 |
| Scorched | +75 |
| Meteors | +125 |

When I say ""Tendrils with ore modifier"", I mean gold ore tendrils, diamond ore tendrils, etc. Tendrils alone doesn't affect stability. It is unknown what modifiers on tendrils add instability, but I would guess that it's just ores. Things like netherrack or glass should be fine.  
For the positive symbols (Charged, Explosions, Scorched, and Meteors), I'm pretty sure the stability will be added for the first three times you include a symbol. After that, no stability will be added. For the negative symbols (Dense Ores and Accelerated), the instability is added for each time you write the symbol into the age. I don't know if the effects of these symbols stack though.

Unfortunately, these symbols are not the only way to generate instability. If you forget a symbol or add too many of a symbol, you add instability.

| Error | Stability |
|-----|-----|
| Extra Biome Controller | -200 |
| Extra Sun | -100 |
| Extra Moon | -100 |
| Extra Biome | -100 |
| Missing Biome Controller | -50 |
| Missing Sun | -25 |
| Missing Moon | -25 |
| Missing Biome | -25 |

This is all you can affect when you're writing the age. It is unknown if this also applies to completely blank ages.

Now that you have this stability score, we can figure how the instability will manifest itself. Each form of instability has its own threshold. If your stability score is lower than the threshold, that form of instability may be put into your age. I should note that I do not know how effects are chosen, only their thresholds.

| Instability | Threshold |
|-----|-----|
| White Decay | -1000 |
| Black Decay | -700 |
| Meteors | -525 |
| Crumble | -500 |
| Blue Decay | -400 |
| Purple Decay | -400 | 
| Blindness | -375 |
| Volcano | -375 |
| Green Decay | -300 |
| Erosion | -300 |
| Explosion | -300 |
| Scorched | -225 |
| Red Decay | -200 |
| Hunger | -150 |
| Poison | -150 |
| Confusion | -75 |
| Enemy Regen | NULL |
| Fatigue | NULL |
| Lightning | NULL |
| Slow | NULL |
| Weakness | NULL |

Here is where we get into a bit of speculation. For all of these NULL values, I'm assuming NULL is zero. This means that if you have any instability at all, those effects may be in your age. Fortunately, each effect that is generated for your age adds to its stability. This means that just because your stability is -1000, you won't get every bad effect. 

| Effect | Stability |
|-----|-----|
| White Decay | +750 |
| Black Decay | +500 |
| Meteors | +375 |
| Blue Decay | +300 |
| Green Decay | +300 |
| Purple Decay| +300 |
| Red Decay | +300 |
| Blindness | +250 |
| Crumble | +250 |
| Volcano | +225 |
| Hunger | +150 |
| Poison | +150 |
| Scorched | +150 |
| Fatigue | +125 |
| Erosion | +100 |
| Confusion | +75 |
| Enemy Regen | +75 |
| Lightning | +75 |
| Slow | +75 |
| Weakness | +75 |
| Explosion | +50 |

Well, that's the extent of my discoveries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

1372170488.0,216,self.feedthebeast,1h1eh0,Mystcraft lesser known random facts,Rseding91,244,28,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1h1eh0/mystcraft_lesser_known_random_facts/,"I tried to find this information for a few days but I got nothing. So, I decided to do some digging and get the information right from the source code of Mystcraft.






To start with: **What does ""Dense Ores"" actually DO?**




Once per chunk generation per dense ores page:

* 10 extra iron/coal clusters between 0-128

* 4 extra gold clusters between 0-42

* 6 extra redstone clusters between 0-21

* 4 extra diamond clusters between 0-21

* 4 extra lapis clusters between 0-21



* Clusters will not generate in mid air meaning not all randomly generated clusters will actually be generated

* Unless a mod specifically tells Mystcraft to make Dense Ores effect its ore generation it will not effect it




Secondly: **How do instabilities work?**




Instabilities will never be added to the list of available random instabilities an age might have if the age instability is below their level to begin with:


* blindness = 375

* confusion = 300

* crumble = 500

* decayBlack = 700

* decayBlue = 400

* decayGreen = 400

* decayPurple = 400

* decayRed = 400

* decayWhite = 1000

* enemyregen = 0

* erosion = 300

* explosion = 300

* fatigue = 0

* hunger = 150

* lightning = 0

* meteors = 525

* poison = 150

* scorched = 225

* slow = 0

* volcano = 375

* weakness = 0






**The limits of specific instabilities that can automatically be added to an age from the weighted list are:**




* Blindness: 1

* Confusion: 1

* Crumble: 20

* All decay: unlimited

* Enemy Regeneration: 10

* Erosion: 2

* Explosions: 20

* Fatigue: 8

* Hunger: 8

* Lightning: 20

* Meteors: unlimited

* Poison: 10

* Scorched earth: 2

* Slowness: 9

* Volcano: 3

* Weakness: 10




**When manually adding instability symbols to an age they will only help so much. After that the stability effects no longer apply (however the instability effects will keep stacking past the automatically-added instability limits of that symbol).**




Those limits are:




* Explosions: 3

* Charged: 3

* Meteors: 3

* Scorched: 3




Adding specific pages causes instability:




* Dense Ores adds 600 instability per page.

* Accelerated adds 250 instability per page.

* Altering tendrils with blocks (Diamonds/Gold/etc.). Adds 10 times the instability factor of what you made them out of (factors listed below).

* Altering the terrain or ocean with blocks (Lava/Oil/End Stone/etc.). Adds 100 times the instability factor of what you made them out of (factors listed below). It should be noted that in vanilla Mystcraft there are no blocks that add instability that can also be used to replace terrain so this only applies for oil right now.




Block replacement instability factors:



* diamond = 100

* gold = 80

* iron = 50

* coal = 10

* oil = 5

* everything else = 0





**Some pages if added too many times will cause instability:**



* Crystals: 3

* Glowstone Crystals: 3

* Tendrils: 10

* Strongholds: 3

* Dungeons: 3

* Mineshafts: 3

* NetherFort: 3

* Obelisks: 8

* Villages: 3


**When a instability is -automatically- enabled in an age it removes some of that numbered instability from the total using these numbers:**



* blindness = 250

* confusion = 75

* crumble = 250

* decayBlack = 500

* decayBlue = 300

* decayGreen = 300

* decayPurple = 300

* decayRed = 300

* decayWhite = 750

* enemyregen = 75

* erosion = 100

* explosion = 50

* fatigue = 125

* hunger = 150

* lightning = 75

* meteors = 375

* poison = 150

* scorched = 150

* slow = 75

* weakness = 75

* volcano = 225




**When the 4 instability symbols are added as pages (Explosions, Charged, Meteors, Scorched) they reduce instability by these amounts (referencing the list above) per page up to the limit listed above:**



* lightning / 3

* meteors / 3

* explosion / 2

* scorched / 2



That means that charged removes 75/3 or 25 instability from an age when added manually.



That also means that with 1 dense ores page, 3 charged and 3 scorched earth it leaves an instability score of 300 (600 - (25 * 3) - (75 * 3)) and with a good chance it will pick random rebuff's that don't effect the player much (weakness, charged again, scorched earth again...)




Thirdly: **symbol count has zero effect on age stability as long as you meet the required symbols in the required order and don't exceed the limit of a given page.**




If there's anything I missed or if someone wants to know something else about Mystcraft just let me know and I'll do my best to answer it.

[](/rdcry)I am here to bring forth this Public Service Announcement concerning the usage of a certain wiki. I have seen people STILL using the Wikia website and it makes me sad. So I am here to inform those of you who do not know.

The wikia is holding the website up against the wishes of the original creators to make a profit off of the content within from unknowing users that don't know what it implies. The creators have done all they can to dissuade people from using it wikia, even getting themselves banned in the process.

[](/sbbook)If you need information on FTB, please, I beg of you, to use [The REAL Unofficial FTB Wiki](http://ftbwiki.org). The only way we can stop this is by telling everyone we can about the wikia and the far superior, and subreddit/community supported [FTB Unofficial Wiki](http://ftbwiki.org).

1369156212.0,149,self.feedthebeast,1ervns,Reflections on the Sub,ACraftAway,227,78,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ervns/reflections_on_the_sub/,"After seeing the comments/discussions throughout this sub in the past couple of months, all I have to say is what's with the giant circlejerk and all around hate for anything that doesn't agree with popular opinion.


First:
If someone brings up the words Tekkit and/or Technic, you people go all into ragemode and start with downvotes and obligatory ""Dont say the T-word"". Like seriously people wtf drop that shit, I see some people bring up Tekkit for legitimate reasons (like discussing a certain mod) and then people just downvote the crap out of them. Drama is unnecessarily created because of a damn word, the past's the past lets leave it like that. 


Second:
Any attack on a LP'er/streamer is apparently an attack on the whole subreddit. Some people take their mc too seriously and can't stand it when other members point out flaws and errors that a lper/streamer does. Majority of these people have received a God status on this sub and are hailed above anyone else. When I see posts for good Lp's instead of comments that can give good feedback, some people just start criticizing the person for not being like a famous youtuber (like wtf, everyone has their own style).


Third:
Downvotes for an unpopular opinion. I have seen many comments where people are downvoted for an unpopular opinion. This is NOT what you downvote for; however, it keeps happening and to be honest just ruins the sub by seeing people are so ignorant and stupid. 


Lastly:
FTB IMHO has turned into a tekkit classic kinda thing. What i mean is that the collection of modpacks are really the only reason people still play 1.4.7. This contradicts FTB's philosophy of being first to update. The youtubers are still playing 1.4 and encouraging people to stay until 1.6 which is retarded. TechnicTeam dropped a 1.5 pack just recently and guess whats its pretty awesome. Slowpoke said yesterday about a 1.5 beta pack which has been ""in the making"" for sooo long now. Idk what took them so long, but I made a 1.5.2 with more or less all the FTB mods out of the box without even changing ids (last week). I don't know whats taking slow so long, but to be honest the delay and lack of communication has just been unacceptable. (Edit: Yes I know he posted yesterday, but that was like after a couple weeks)


~~Also as said above FTB used to look toward the future and yet now they are encouraging players to stay an mc version behind and all the youtubers are doing the same.~~ (Edit: Repetitive) 

In addition the ForgeCraft peeps have basically turned into what I call the Forge Goons. Why? Well they get to test mods before us and are playing beta versions on 1.5 while we are still playing 1.4. (Understandable to some degree since they are famous and it helps promote the Mod)This forces us to watch their content because they are the main source for new updates. If you really want your mod to excel post it publicly and let us beta test rather than a closed group of tubers/streamers who from recent videos look like they are just in it for the money. I rather play a new buggy beta with new content rather than an old version. (Edit: Yes i would report bugs, so we can get them fixed faster)


I know a bunch of this prolly sounds retarded, but my main point is chill out peeps its just a game, so can we have a regular discussion on things related to FTB/Forge or are we always gonna have the same haters/trolls/circlejerkers. This sub used to be a place where you could post anything related to FTB/Forge and have legitimate discussion on it now its just filled with a bunch of closeminded Redittors who frankly don't know how to have a discussion and hail the FTB team and related co. as their Gods. 

P.S. If forge had a central Repo (like DevBukkit) and a main launcher we wouldn't need FTB, Tekkit, BigDig, 
etc. We would/could be just one giant Forge Community instead of being limited by popular Mod Packs and hating each other.

End of rant.

1363899081.0,146,self.feedthebeast,1ar80o,Often forgotten early game Items that would make your life a lot easier.,Cheetah0942,170,24,173,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ar80o/often_forgotten_early_game_items_that_would_make/,"From past experience I know, that I often forget useful low-tech Items in the early stages of the game. I tend to rather do lots of research in TC for proper Boots, when a simple pair of Rubber Bots would have done the job.

Since I am about to start a new world on a small server (most likely a tweaked Ultimate), I decided to start a small list to share. Any help on expanding it is appreciated. :)


* IC2: [Rubber Boots](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Rubber_Boots)
As mentioned, they are easy to make and let you cave with much less trouble.

* Factorization: [Barrels](http://ftbwiki.org/Barrel)
Make 3 or 4 of them and store your most common Materials in them. They will save you a lot of time until you get a proper Sorting System going.

* IC2: [Scaffolds](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Scaffold)
They are extremly cheap to make and can be reinforced to remove the building limitations. Plus free ladders.

* Redpower2: [Canvas Bag](http://ftbwiki.org/Canvas_Bag)
They require a lot of String to craft, but almost only that. And a small field of Flax is enough for the first few hours. (also [Seed Bags](http://ftbwiki.org/Seed_Bag_%28RedPower_2%29))

* Redpower2: [Project Tables](http://ftbwiki.org/Project_Table)
There is nothing more annoying than putting most of a recipe in, then realizing you need something from a chest or need to craft a stick to complete the recipe and have to start all over. (thx hsmith711)

* Factorization: [Pocket Crafting Table](http://ftbwiki.org/Pocket_Crafting_Table)
A crafting Table on the go. Nothing less. (thx grey_lollipop)

* Equivalent Exchange 3: [Minium Stone](http://ftbwiki.org/Minium_Stone)
The Minium Stone can convert many Blocks into others and additionally serves as a portable crafting table. But it requires gold and some monster drops. (thx LRafols)

* Applied Energistics: [Quartz Grind Stone](http://ftbwiki.org/Quartz_Grind_Stone)
It works like a Macerator but is driven by hand and crafted with just Stone, a Wooden Gear and some Quartz Dust. (thx moustache20)

* IC2: [Bronze Armor](http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Bronze_Chestplate)
Almost as good as diamond, and way better than iron. Perfect for wearing on your early caving expeditions. (thx diafygi)

* Redpower2: [Sickle](http://ftbwiki.org/Sickle)
Removes Grass in a 5x5 and Leaves in a 3x3 space, while retaining the drop chance of saplings/seeds. (thx PoisonBerry)

* Portalgun Gun Mod: [Weighted Companion Cube](http://ftbwiki.org/Weighted_Companion_Cube)
Heals 1 heart every 5 seconds regardless of food. Great for staying alive early game. (thx osand317)

* Forestry: [Miners](http://ftbwiki.org/Miner%27s_Backpack) and [Diggers Backpack](http://ftbwiki.org/Digger%27s_Backpack)
A must for any serious mining expeditions. (thx Juice573)

* Computercraft: [Miningt Turtle](http://ftbwiki.org/Mining_Turtle)
Requires some LUA knowledge and either diamonds or gems, so its not really an early game item but if you go for it, it can still be crafted very early in your journey. (thx jaconok)
EDIT: Apparently you can go without LUA: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ar80o/often_forgotten_early_game_items_that_would_make/c901qac) is more from Bockit.

* GregTech: [Flint Mortar](http://gregtech-addon.wikispaces.com/Flint+Mortar)
Single use Pulverizer, crafted just from a Flint and a stone bowl. The [Iron Mortar](http://gregtech-addon.wikispaces.com/Iron+Mortar) is a slightly less cheap upgrade for harder Materials. (thx SketchyBrown)

* Redpower2: [Athame](http://ftbwiki.org/Athame)
A ritual Dagger crafted from a Stick and a single piece of Silver, that is able to kill Endermen in two hits. (thx Mitoni)

* BiblioCraft: [Tape Measure](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1680480-15x-147forgesmp-bibliocraft-v115-v112-bookcases-armor-stands-shelves-and-more-updated-03212013/)
Tape measure is good for measuring distances. Won't save your life but it's nice to have. (thx no-longer-inadequate)

* Railcraft: [Coke Oven](http://ftbwiki.org/Coke_Oven)
It requires a lot os Sand and Bricks, but only that. Given enough time it turns your coal into the more powerful coal coke. And save the creosote Oil for later.

* IC2: [Iron Furnace](http://ftbwiki.org/Iron_Furnace)
More costefficient and a bit faster for only a regular furnace and 5 Iron Ingots? Sounds like a plan. (thx TheEternallyRustled)

* Vanilla: Bucket with Water.
No seriously, the amount of times I got saved from that... Handy in so many ways. Usually my first three iron go to this if I dont find one in a chest.

Any more recommendations?

Gregtech has quickly become my second favorite mod. (After TC3, of course)

Back in Technic, I'd set up a few solar panels first thing, and have essentially infinite power instantaneously. It took what, a macerator? A bit of copper? It was nothing. And speaking of which, the macerator, a machine that doubles all your ores, took some flint and iron. Again, that's nothing.

I love the feeling I got when I blasted those silicon plates to make my first solar panel, I love having to explore Thermal Expansion and Forestry to make up for the nerfs, I was actually excited to build my first centrifuge, and it was thrilling building, and subsequently upgrading, my industrial blast furnace, because it held weight. It meant something. 

Gregtech was the best thing to happen to Industrialcraft since Industrialcraft 2.

Just wanted to give everyone a heads up here on a bug which I apparently introduced in the 2.2.1 update and is probably causing a lot of issues, but you really have to look for it. The evidence has been kind of anecdotal and no official issue was posted on the tracker, which is why we only just figured it out.

Basically, I introduced a change to Liquiducts which in a lot of cases is fine, but there's a screwup when BC pumps are involved. Basically, if you connect Liquiducts directly to a BC pump, OR a tesseract bridge which is directly connected to a BC pump, you are going to lose a LOT of liquid.

A temporary fix for this is to do pump -&gt; BC pipe -&gt; Tesseract bridge -&gt; Liquiduct.

We will hopefully have this fixed ASAP along with some other bug fixes and performance improvements. Really sorry about this one.",,False,self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,t3_18ypc5,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/18ypc5/psa_confirmed_liquiduct_bug_my_bad/,

I am one of the admins of the Unofficial FTB Wiki. I'm not sure if this is against the rules of this reddit or otherwise an issue, but since it is relevant to Feed The Beast, I hope I am not completely wrong in posting this.

Formerly on http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com , the Unofficial FTB Wiki has now moved to [http://ftbwiki.org](http://ftbwiki.org).

Some of you may already have seen it. We have moved away from Wikia to an independent domain. Although right now we have put up a notice on every page of the old Wikia, we know that Wikia is a for-profit organization and does not like losing revenue. Judging by previous stories of communities leaving Wikia, it is likely that the notice is going to be removed as soon as they catch wind of it, which is why I am trying to also spread the word outside a bit. There is no good way to delete a Wikia once it's made.

ftbwiki.org may be slow to load right now. There's still some cleanup to do, but all of the content has been moved to the new website and the new wiki should be fully functional. We now have a new (hopefully better) layout. There's also a few other skins we are going to support which are still in development:

[Vector](http://ftbwiki.org/?useskin=vector)

[Monobook](http://ftbwiki.org/?useskin=monobook)

[WPTouch](http://ftbwiki.org/?useskin=wptouch) (for portable devices)


Although there's still much to work on, we hope that this change will also help us get more organized and better established. Leaving wikia gives us much more autonomy and independence.

Once again, apologies if this does not belong here. Thanks, and hope to see you there!

I wanted to take the chance to introduce the community to a mod I recently began developing called Liquid Dynamics. Its goal: To turn water into a viable resource for construction, power generation, and even weapon creation. While it is still in early EARLY development, I would like to take the chance now to ask the community for what they would like to see added to the mod, or have the mod address gameplay-wise. To keep this simple, here are a few of the things that will definitely be happening:

* Living in a ocean biome will be completely viable. Ocean biomes will no longer be useless, or just an easy way to farm oil.

* Realistic coral reefs will be implemented. The ocean floors will be dotted with coral of all colors, some bio-luminescent. These blocks will be brand new models that interact in the water naturally (ie. no weird air spaces in the empty space between). The initial function of this coral will be to replace wood as a necessary resource, but many tech features will require various types of coral to create.

* Water will no longer be a secondary resource. Instead, water will be able to be processed in such a way to be usable as a building material, essentially being transformed into a clear jelly that when shaped and hardened, can be used for piping, construction, weaponry, and more. 

* A unique power system involving water will be implemented. While the details of this are not definite, I can assure you it will involve multi-block structures that are both aesthetically pleasing and intricate. A simple example could be hydro-electric energy involving intricate dam structures that utilize height to ensure water is travelling at the highest velocity before reaching the turbines, thus resulting more energy. Don't worry, I will implement a power conversion system, either through Power Converters, or something native.

I am aware that some of these ideas do not sound completely fleshed out, and thats because they aren't. Instead, I would rather ensure I'm developing a mod that has the communities input in mind. I believe the best ideas stem from group discussion, versus one person's opinion on what the ""best"" is. Keep in mind though that the overall feel for this mod should blend eco-friendly practices in with technological advancement. The idea would be a civilation that, when faced with extinction, used the natural environment around them to survive, while ensuring it would exist in the future rather than be overused.

With that said, feel free to let me know what you think! I will do my best to answer any questions, and elaborate on anything that feels confusing or out of place.",,False,self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,t3_1i1y09,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1i1y09/introducing_liquid_dynamics_a_new_mod_i_am/,

This one is all made in Java, no extra dependencies. Just open it to run.

[**Get it now!**](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/861751/imageconverter.jar)

It will ask you for the source image, destination file, the ComputerCraft image size (a full 8x6 monitor is 82x40) and whether to stretch or fit. Use pastebin to get the destination file in your computers and paintutils to draw it:

    image = paintutils.loadImage(""imageFileNameHere"")
    paintutils.drawImage(image, 1, 1)

Simple as that.

Well, I was fed up with Greg's changes, but still likes the endgame stuff, and other features of the mod. So I decided to make an alternative for people who want it. The mod is in the early dev stage, but I am moving fast. The mod would include a lot of what you all love from gregtech, and an in-game config for harder/easier recipes for you hardcore players out there. Heres what I have so far, and my ideas for this mod:

**Machines:**
Things like Fusion Reactors, Fission Reactors, and all those fun machines from GregTech. I also plan to incorporate EU usage, and perhaps a in-house power unit.

**Armor**
 We would have 3 or more armor sets that I planned so far. 

**Materials**
My mod would use common sense, and science. Real-life materials with their real-life properties. Things like Graphene, PVC, and Tungsten are some primary materials, but more will be added and thought up.

**Power**
I spoke about this promptly above, but let's elaborate. The machines will use an in-house power unit, but later on will; probably add EU and MJ support. To generate this power, we will have plasma generation, thermal generation, solar, eolian, hydro(this will play a much larger role than IC2 watermills, because where I live, most of our power is Hydro), Fission and Fusion power gen(based on the real life processes, not just a 1m^2 block that magically turns uranium into power)

All the power (except solar) would be focused around a turbine of sorts. For example; water would spin a turbine, which creates the power. Nuclear power creates steam which goes into a turbine and makes power. People also seem to be worried about water and how easy it would be for power. Let me clarify; the water mill would need to have a flowing water block touching it to generate power, and a lone would generate probably the same or a bit more power than a redstone engine. So you would need to have an array of water mills all underneath(example) flowing water to generate decent power. 


So that's a simple run down of what I have planned/coded. A beta will be up soon! If you have any suggestions, post away! Also, i'm looking for (a) texturer(s), so If you're interested, PM me!

Edit: People Seem to want MJ, so we will use that instead of a in-house power unit!


Edit 2: We have some coders on board, and I will have the github up later today for people who want to view the source code!


Edit 2.1: Added info to power gen!


Edit 3: **Git is up!** [Find it here](https://github.com/Dtroll/FuturologyMod)

Edit 4: Modders can check out the Git Above, and PM me their git users so i can add them. ",,False,self,t5_2v620,1374350462.0,,,True,t3_1ilmq3,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ilmq3/gregtech_alternative_wip/,

So last night I was sitting around chatting to a few people about various things when something dawned on me. After some quick verification it turned out that today is the first anniversary of the birth of FTB.

Twelve Months ago a group of us sat around in the Direwolf20 IRC channel just chilling and chatting with not a lot planned for the weekend. In order to help pass the time I came up with an idea to have a race against one of the other Direwolf20 Admins (aka Nishtown) to see who could built 10 items from various mods the quickest. Honestly when compiling the list, I expected it to last a week or two. It included items such as a functioning Red Power Sorting System and a working Industrial Craft Nuclear Reactor. We played using the same pack that Direwolf20 was using for his series. Instead of taking a week or more, less that 48 hours later, we finished within 20 minutes of each other.

We had enough fun that weekend that the following weekend we did something similar, except this time we started in a void world with a glass monument to display items.People watched this on stream and enough people were interested in trying it out for themselves that we released a private little pack for our community. The map started to grow in popularity within our community to the point where we really wanted to do something that was a bit more special. Getting together with a few members of the community we expanded on the idea and one of the community members (Shadow) put forth a plan to automate the process of item in, reward out. That map was built and released to the community at large. Soon after we built a multiplayer version on request for Direwolf20 and Nearbygamer and much fun was had while they spent 4 hours (I kid you not) trying to figure out how to get iron.

The youtube series was a huge success, but one thing always held us back. There was no easy way to install the mods or the map. Various attempts were made to get a solution to this and in time the FTB launcher was released and the forums created. The community expanded rapidly and today we arrive at a point where I look back at what has been an incredible year. Along the way of course there has been high points and low points as inevitably always happens. Good friends have been made and an awesome community has evolved around us.

However we havent even come close to finishing yet. Plans are already in place for the future. Work has already started on the next generation of FTB maps. In a couple of months we will have a group of FTB staff getting together at Pax East where we plan to host an open FTB server and an Official FTB Tournament hosted by the Pax East team. We still have more official packs that will be released once the necessary mods have been completed and some other stuff behind the scenes that we will talk about in the future.

I want to finish this post by doing what people normally do at times like this, and that is thanking everyone who has contributed towards FTB over the last 12 months. The amount of people that have had involvement in one form or another is pretty insane. When you take into account Mod Developers, Website Developers, Launcher Team, Pack Team, Map Builders, Forum Moderators and many many more people, I wouldn't even want to guess how many people that is. Well over a hundred though at a guess. Of course I have to thank everyone who uses the FTB launcher and have played the maps. We haven't always gotten things right, but we have always tried to do our best and no matter what,most have you have stuck by us. 

**p.s.For anyone still reading this long post, on a personal level to celebrate this year, I will be recreating the event that started it all off. From 5pm GMT (12pm EST) I will be livestreaming on twitch.tv/slowpoke101 where we will follow in the footsteps of a year ago. A list of 10 achievements have been set out and a random spawn will be selected. This will start a race to complete the objectives in the fastest time. (there are no prizes, this is purely for fun.) Everyone is invited to join in over the weekend. A section in the forums will be opened up where you can link streams or youtube videos of your attempts or if you want just post screenshots of your progress through the challenges. I am sure along the way we will be joined by all sorts of people stopping by to say hello etc, so feel free to join in.** 

Thanks,  

Slowpoke.

It is mostly based off the info from NEI and for the Fortune III stats i spawned 100 off each block, mined them, tallied the results, and just divided by 100. Its not perfect but it is a close estimation of what to expect from Fortune III on a single block. The bottom of the chart is a bit messy/confusing but i just tried adding what other things you might get from a quarry that you might want auto processed. The Chart currently only has full blocks listed, I plan to add a section at some point for Dusts and other things.  

Basically I wanted to set up my full scale base now that I'm established enough on FTB and I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with each resource as it came into my system. I hope someone else finds it useful as I spent way too much time making it instead of playing!  

EDIT: Forgot to mention it is based off the Mindcrack Pack W/Gregtech on hardmode(not sure if any of this is actually effected by hardmode but just in case.)

Edit 2: For those not too familiar with Spreadsheets and other documents. You can type [CTRL]+F to bring up the Find window and then type in what you are looking for. ex typing in gold will highlight all the ways you can get gold.

[Check the other thread with a link to the IMGUR album!](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/18k6nl/redpower_sorting_now_with_pictures/)

This is a basic text guide to Redpower sorting in FTB. ~~I'll add pictures later.~~ I'm discussing IC2 machines here, but Thermal expansion machines can be used as well. You just have to use a relay next to them, and ignore the section about pulling from them with filters.

The place to start is your input chest. You dump everything to be sorted here. I use an enderchest so I can access it with an enderpouch from anywhere. Helps keep my inventory clean. Use a sorting machine to pull from the enderchest.

Your sorter settings should be auto pull, and use the colors to direct your items. I mark off what needs to be macerated in blue, and what needs to go directly to the smelter in red. So if I dump ore in, it goes to the macerator, and if I dump raw porkchops, they go to the furnace. You'll want to use the mode with a default color, I use black. That means anything that isn't specifically marked with a color will be marked black and dumped into the network.

I also put all the dusts in the sorter and mark them red as well. If you're worried about getting the weird ingot versions, you can put those in the macerator line. That way any weird ingots will be ground up and reprocessed into the same kind as everything else.

Now you need to paint your tubes. IC2 machines are fed from the top when using redpower, so paint the tubes on top of the machines to match the colors in your sorter. You can also add additional processing lines, like an extractor color or a compressor color, to make it easy to mass produce some of the more advanced items. Just be sure to mark the items and colors in your sorter.

Now you need to pull items back out of your machines. With redpower, you can either push items or pull them. Transposers and filters push items on a redstone pulse (as do sorters in some modes), retrievers (with redstone) and managers pull items. Transposers will grab one item at a time and push it down the line. Filters will grab up to a stack, and you can put items inside to specify what they take. Empty filters accept everything. Filters also allow you to mark them with colors.

Retrievers will pull items from any inventory on the connected network. THey're like a remote filter. If you put items inside, it will only request those items, and it can mark colors. Upside to a retriever is that you only need one, downside is that it always pulls from the nearest inventory first. So if you have a setup with several machines running very fast, the machines farther down the network won't be pulled from until the first machine is empty. 

Filters are relatively cheap, and can pull a full stack on every pulse. So even though you need one for each machine, you also ensure you're completely emptying your processing machines.

Now, a word about how tubes work. Tubes are smarter than BC pipes, but they're still pretty dumb. As long as you understand how they send items around, and keep your network structure in mind, you'll see how powerful they can be.

An item can be pushed into a tube, or pulled in. Pulled items will always make their way to the device that requested them. Pushed items will always go to the nearest available inventory that can accept them. Items in color can go down blank tubes, or tubes of their own color, but will never enter a tube of a different color even if the system is overfilled. Uncolored items can go wherever they want, so if you are using colors in your system, it's important to keep that in mind. 

The next thing to know about tubes is that each set of tubes that are connected to eachother is its own network. If you have five tubes, and then a filter, and then five more tubes, you have 2 separate networks. This is important because retrievers and managers can only pull from their same network, and won't pull 'through' another machine. Machines in between networks also strip colors off items. Finally, you can re-use colors as long as they're on separate networks. 

Machines can be placed next to inventories, or inline. Inline transposers are valves. They close that path if they are powered. Inline filters are also valves, but can paint and selectively pass items. Inline retrieivers are valves, can paint, and they can selectively request items. (they can also pull EVERYTHING. Don't hook up a retriever to a clock signal with nothing inside it. It will try and empty every chest on the input side of the network!)

Finally, you have restriction tubes. Since tubes always calculate the shortest path to the nearest available inventory, it counts the number of tubes an item has to path through. Restriction tubes add 5000 to that number. This will make them the LAST destination, even if there's empty inventories waiting on the other side. They can also be painted, for more control options. Restriction tubes can also be stacked, so you could have multiple stages of last resort, for example 1 restrictor in front of your recycler, and 2 restrictors leading to the trash. So it will try to place cobble (for example) somewhere in the network, but if no available slots can be found, it will send it to the recycler. If the recycler is full, then it will send it to the trash.

If you want to keep tubes from connecting to eachother, or to machines or inventories, you can use covers to separate them. Also, painted tube only connect to the same color or to blank tubes. 

So now we're pulling items out of your machines. Like I said, I suggest filters on the a side face (front and back work too). I tend to run pipes into the top, EU into the back, and pull from the front. You can run redwire over the top of the filters, or you can use redstone tubes.

Since we're pulling items that may or may not be finished, I suggest sending them back to your input chest for reprocessing. So we put a restriction tube on the bottom of your chest, and paint it white. We then set the filters to output everything as white. As long as there are no other valid destinations for the dusts or ingots that are white or blank, they should ignore the distance calculation and head for your input chest. 

You might ask why I don't output from macerators directly into the furnaces. Because not everything that gets macerated needs to be smelted. By sending it back to be re-sorted, it allows more control and secondary processing. 

So from your processing unit, we have dusts and ingots (we're keeping it simple). Dusts need to be smelted, so in the sorter we put them on the red column. Ingots need to be stored, but we don't want to mark them out for special treatment, so the sorter will use the default color and mark them black, and dump them out into the network.

Now you have to decide how you want to store items. Chests or barrels? Barrels are the easier option, but they have some downsides. They have to be fed from the top, which can make tube runs a pain.
They only accept one type of item, (making sorting easy) but if you use up the last one, then it's likely that some other item will fall into the barrel instead, which can clog up your system.

Chests are a more powerful option, but you'll need inline sorters and a lot of paint to make them do exactly what you want, if you want to do more than 8 colors.

This is where the fact that each network is separate comes in handy. I like to send all black painted items through a series of sorters. Each sorter can mark up to 8 colors + a default. So you can put up to 8 chests per sorter, and then have the default color leading to the next sorter, rinse, repeat. I like to reduce this and use 6 chests per sorter, since that allows you to have more than 1 column of five items per chest. If you are flush with resources, you can use the entire inventory of the sorter for one color, which is awesome for sorting all common items from a given mod into a single chest, or group of chests.

Now, at some point, you'll get to the end of your sorting line, and everything you wanted marked and stuffed into a chest or barrel will be stored. But you will still have some items left over. We don't have the time or energy to mark every possible item, and RP does mark a difference between the same items with damage. 

This is where the overflow chest comes in. Your over flow chest is anything that you want to dump unsorted or overflow items into. It should have a restriction tube on it, marked with your default color. 

If you've been following along, you know at this point that every item that isn't specified in a sorter or filter should be black. But items that overflow from a chest or barrel, usually cobble/dirt etc. will be marked whatever that original color was. If you're using the serial sorter method, that can be a problem. I like to have relief valves on each subnetwork, usually a couple of restriction tubes that are unmarked, or an item detector and transposer. (item detectors can be set to emit a redstone signal if their output network is overfilled. So you can use this with a NOT gate to trigger a transposer to open and provide an alternate path.

I hope this clears up some of the confusion people have about using redpower tubes and machines. I'll put some pictures together, and edit this if I get feeback later today.

Happy sorting!

[So, 13 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1dh7gg/gregtech_from_scratch_a_tutorial_series/) I started a tutorial series, aiming to teach anyone how to use GregTech. I finished the series 6 days ago with 11 episodes on it. I've made it so that each episode tackles a particular aspect of the mod (covers, upgrades, fusion reactor, etc). Additionally, I'm planning to add video change logs of the changes to the mod to that playlist.

I'm pretty happy about the results and I hope you enjoy watching the videos as much as I did making them. 

You can check out the playlist here: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0AxSV9isODMp91p5ujrDC9FYqPDqn7u2

## Which FTB pack do I choose?

In Technic land, the choice was relatively simple - Technic for extra mods or Tekkit for multiplayer. But in the FTB launcher right now, you'll see the Mindcrack pack, the direwolf20 pack, the beta pack, the retro pack and the magic pack.

### Which packs shouldn't you start with right now?

* The retro pack is for 1.2.5 and exists so that people can play the old FTB map. It can be ignored.
* The beta pack was the first pack out for the launcher. It will be replaced by a tech pack eventually. It's still in 1.4.2, and is not entirely compatible with future packs. Don't start a new world with this pack, as it will be difficult to upgrade (but possible for someone to write a converter)
* The magic pack filled two purposes - first it was a pack for 1.4.5 while the beta pack couldn't update, and secondly for a pack focused around Thaumcraft. However, Thaumcraft is in both the newer packs, leaving the magic pack somewhat redundant.

### Choices

This leaves two choices - the direwolf20 pack and the Mindcrack pack. These modpacks are both for 1.4.6, should both be upgradable to the ultimate pack when it comes out, and are both good choices, depending on what you want. They have slightly different sets of mods included and Reddit user Kghareus did up [a diagram to compare them](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/15cwpn/ftb_146_pack_comparison/c7lif9y).

The short of it is that the Mindcrack pack is harder, including more difficult mods such as Advanced Solars instead of Compact Solars, and Gregtech with the hard mode recipes which make IC2 items more expensive. 

## Why can't I craft [IC2 ITEM X]?

If it's related to Nuclear Reactors, IC2 changed how they are done entirely. Most types of components now have multiple variations rather than single components.

Otherwise, for some items like the Macerator, you may be playing on a server or modpack with the GregTech hard mode recipes enabled. These change the IC2 recipes to be much more expensive (e.g. requiring diamonds for a macerator). These are because the mod author of GregTech felt that IC2 was too unbalanced and too easy early game. This is rather controversial. Early game alternatives if this is beyond your control are the Thermal Expansion machines, which run off Buildcraft power. The Powered Furnace is exactly what it says on the tin, and the Pulverizer works like a macerator.

## Why aren't my redstone engines working?

In the new version of Buildcraft, redstone engines are only able to power pumps, wooden transport pipes, and wooden waterproof pipes. This was because the Buildcraft maintainers didn't like that people were powering quarries with stacks of redstone engines for basically free power.

## Where is Redpower 2?

Redpower 2 is only in the direwolf20 and Mindcrack packs. It was not updated in time for the beta or magic packs.

## What happened to EE?

The maintainer of EE, Pahimar is rewriting the mod from scratch, with significant changes. As EE3 is still in prerelease and has very few features finished, it is not included in most packs. It is in the direwolf20 pack only. Collectors, Red Matter, and the power tools (like the destruction catalyst) are removed for good. The Energy Condenser has a replacement planned, but will probably require more maintenance.

## Can I convert my Technic/Tekkit world?

While theoretically possible for someone to write a converter, no one has yet, and because of big changes (the end of EE2 and TC2 for example) many items will be removed from your world even if someone eventually does.

## Where is the wiki?

At the moment there are two wikis. The [official wiki](http://wiki.feed-the-beast.net), which is currently empty and not editable by the public and the [unofficial one](http://ftbwiki.org) which is far more complete, but isn't that reliable yet. You're best to read specific mod wikis for the time being, but keep in mind that Gregtech may change things if hard mode is on, so double check against NEI.

## What is up with the Rotary Macerator/other advanced machines?

There are two versions of Advanced Machines - AtomicStryker's and Snyke's. Technic has always used Snyke's, which works entirely like the Induction Furnace - no upgrades, takes MV, uses 1 EU/t when idling, 16 when active. AtomicStryker's version is initially slower and only takes LV but can be upgraded to be even faster. However, it had some bugs in the 1.4.2 version which could crash servers, and also had issues with using too much power when upgraded, so it's not in any of the newer packs yet. The FTB devs prefer AtomicStryker's though, so if either gets added again, it will be that one.

## What mods are not there that were in Technic or Tekkit?

* Equivalent Exchange 2 (EE3 is in the direwolf20 pack)
* Thaumcraft 2 (TC3 is in some packs, but is entirely redone)
* Advanced Machines
* Nether Ores
* Power Converters (use the forestry electrical engine for EU -&gt; MJ)
* Treecapitator
* Optifine
* Matmos

## What mods in FTB were not in Technic or Tekkit?

* Thaumcraft 3 (Technic had TC2)
* Forestry (was in much older versions of Technic, removed after a fight with the mod author)
* Factorisation (check out the barrels for cheap ways of storing large amounts of cobble)
* Thermal Expansion (some later versions of Technic had it)
* GregTech
* Soul Shards
* Extra Biomes XL
* Gravisuite
* Xycraft

1353427429.0,103,self.feedthebeast,13ihp7,FEED THE BEAST TIPS!,daebat,116,13,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/13ihp7/feed_the_beast_tips/,"Here are my tips from playing FTB so far:

On my server we've added a mining world and a sand world.  This avoids tearing up all of the land around your living space and causes much less of a problem with other people.

LinkBooks are f'ing great.  Once you've created a mine or quarry or if you just want to have a way to get somewhere quickly, create a link book!

Solar power is over rated and overly expensive... set up a pump in the nether and use geothermal!  It's cheap and very efficient.  

Turtles.  I made six of these and have just been raping level 12 in my mine world.  It cost about 1-2 coal for one turtle to tunnel a 3x2x50 hole.  Set up six and you've got yourself a lot of ore.  This also creates a great place for slime to spawn = railcraft eventually!

Void pipes.  If you do set up a quarry just pump the cobble and dirt into void pipes.  This will avoid issues with overflowing chests and such.  

Portal Guns! They're cheap and they're very obviously the best way to get around in the nether pre-jetpack.  Even with jetpack they're a little safer. 

~~Crates~~ Barrels.  These hold 64 stacks of 64 items so if you do plan on holding onto all of that cobble, lapis, and redstone, this is a great way to store them efficiently and it looks pretty cool too.  

Find a damn town!  Why mess with tracking down food when you can just find an NPC village and exploit all of their hard work?  They've also got apiaries which allow for the production of bees (and apiaries are expensive!)... also, who knows, you might get something good out of the chests!

Twighlight forest.  While dangerous it is very lucrative to find strongholds and mazes.  They hold many many chests and lots of good stuff come out of them.  Just be careful not to die.

Waypoints!  If you've never used Rei's before, set waypoints!  It's definitely something that should be in vanilla but I'm not even going to go there.  Never get lost again... 

Feeders: we all know everybody is going to kill off the cows in your settling area quickly to make books and get steak so put together a feeder (they're relatively cheap) and let it induce those sweet, sweet cow moans... sorry for going there. 

No Fall Damage Portal Boots - don't leave home without them!  If you have a jetpack or portal gun, this could save your life.  You take no fall damage but it also provides little armor rating.  They're very cheap too!

Also notables:

Water Mills for when you don't have much of anything can be a good source of power.

Rotary Macerator &amp; Industrial Furnace for once you've got a good mine going.  Save up all of your ores and then blast through them all at once using these powerful machines.  

Aerial Faith Plates are really cheap and fun to play around with.  Just make sure you have your portal boots on!

**EDIT: MORE TIPS!**

Obsidian Pressure Plates allow for only players to activate therefore you can place them outside without the worry of chickens or zombies setting them off. 

With the portal gun you can use 'G' to turn on gravity mode allowing for you to pick up blocks... including spawners.  I have a mob grinder set up on my server with three spawners inside.  A lot of xp and loot.

**https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7011174/GregUnleashedv1.1.3.zip**


Goal is to make most mods set to ""hardest"" difficulty possible.

~~Edit 1. Runs atm with BiomesOp disabled.~~

Edit 2. Should work with BiomesOP and all enabled mods from both packs by default.

Edit 3. Dimensional Doors and Underground biomes should work if enabled.

~~Edit 4. Updated Gregtech config to reflect changes to FTB Unhinged pack.~~ ~~Still Working on it. Fix seems to have been a hit and miss from me.~~

Edit 5. All reported bugs should be gone now. Renamed the zip to show thats its another change. If you weren't using BiomesOP just ignore the change. Enjoy until the next bug :p

Edit 6. Added Ars Magica. ~~Default setting since I'm unfamiliar with this mod and don't use it myself.~~

Edit 7. Updated to reflect changes to Unleashed. ~~Unable to fix the Arsmagica bugs with combination of Forestry items.~~ ~~Would only recommend using one version of MFFS since they have some conflicting item id's. Unchanged on purpose to prevent destroying setups in existing worlds.~~

Edit 8. Fixed Ars Magica conflicting item ids. Fix and solution from u/Zuvuxyy and reported by u/barkingnoise.

Edit 9. Updated to be compatible with Unleashed v1.1.2. Both MFFR packs are able to run together now. Tested with all mods from Unleashed+Unhinged enabled and disabled ones.

1374359376.0,99,self.feedthebeast,1ipvt1,Why gregtech is actually succesfull,Hixxae,175,76,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ipvt1/why_gregtech_is_actually_succesfull/,"It came to light that gregtech would have a modpack on its own with very limited additional mods ( relative ).

Sure gregtech is an awesome mod, the centrifuge adds lots of new ways to automate the Secondary goods ( Iron, Gold, Electrum, not ores, but the basic building blocks of all machinery ) and so does the electrolyzer. Other machinery are often there to satisfy the communal desires for late game machinery.

But what makes gregtech shine is that it literally forces you to learn about other mods. It forces you to get into bees, to get a quarry, to get a mystcraft world filled with oil, set up a lava pump, creating humongous biofuel farms, etc.

It is a mod that makes you explore the whole modpack. And if you don't, well good luck doing everything manually.

What I'm trying to say is the following: Gregtech depends on other mods to supply it with primary goods.

A good example would be the matter fabricator. I needed a huge amount of power for it. I've always wanted to do something with the distil tower. I used a **Steve's Cart** treefarm, a **soulshard's** blazefarm combined with **computercraft** melee turtles to fuel the cart, **Builcraft** piping to extract and sort the items, **Redpower II** to transport the items long distances without using tons of gold and for the ease of use, **Forestry** fermenters to convert it to distillable biomass, **Gregtech** distil tower to convert it into biofuel, **Thermal Expansion** item tesseracts to transport them to **Factorization** routers, **Buildcraft** combustion engines also fueled by **Thermal Expansion** Aqueous Accumulators to **Minefactory Power converters** directly into the **Gregtech** matter fabricator.

That's 10 different mods used to power a matter fab through mother nature.

Would I have made such things without gregtech? Lol no. There's simply no need for it.

TL;DR Gregtech shines in forcing you to learn about other mods and be creative how to make them interact to gain the lategame items/machinery. This is also the reason why I truly despise the new changes. Can't we all be friends and not make the modding a warzone?

They put A LOT of work into making the packs we use they code launchers put packs together get working config even support their packs and by sometimes even the mods within them.  If you watch Direwolf's videos you could here the exhaustion in his(slowpokes) voice they wouldn't talk about it on camera and I respect that but you could actually hear it had taken its toll on the him and I'm guessing the whole team.

Its hard when you put a lot of time and love into a project and some stupid fight makes all that more difficult I even have to give a lot of props for how they handled it so quickly and it seems amicably.

However you feel about whats in it I'm guessing a majority of the subscribers use the FTBs pack and we owe them many thanks.

I use the FTB packs because I run my own server that I have 1 or 2 friends rarely log in but I mostly play with my much much younger nephews in different states the FTB pack has freed up what the last time I hosted turned into a VERY large job to help my family install and then later update countless mods.  Now I send out a link to the FTB downloader and a link to my host IP and go back to playing I would not be able to do this without the dedication of the FTB team to making a smooth experience both client and server side with tested and pre-configured packs.

Also a big thank you for all the mod developers to the awesome work so the FTB team had things to include in the packs.

TL:DR thank you for all your work FTB team.

The reason I chose apples and not something with a higher fruit juice yield was because apples are apparently the only fruit that drops in a tree farm (the others require an orchard).

I just wanted to say ""thank you"" to everyone on this subreddit. I began making youtube videos of minecraft when FTB was released and decided to make a plug on this subreddit. Fortunately, unlike on /r/Minecraft, it was well received.

I passed 1,000 subscribers last week and have been steadily climbing at an increasing rate and have even joined the same partnership as SethBling and Juicetra.

Thanks for all the support, continuing to watch my videos and helping get my little channel off the ground.

You guys rock.

P.S.- I didn't link to my channel because I wanted this to be a sincere thank you, and not seem like a plug in disguise. If you are curious, you can message me.

1358185976.0,87,self.feedthebeast,16k86h,PSA: Do not throw away your forcicium ore! Each one has the potential of generating 2million EU from this very simple setup.,Plornt,104,17,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/16k86h/psa_do_not_throw_away_your_forcicium_ore_each_one/,"I found myself filtering out the forcicium from my RP2 tunnel bore as I had gotten too much. I went to find out what it was used for and found it was for the force field system which in itself is pretty cool but as I am not on a PVP server, it was pretty useless to me. 

So today I watch direwolfs spotlight and found out about the MFFS Converter and did a bit of testing and you end up with a net gain of about 250k EU per forcicium (8 per macerated ore). 

This is a quick test setup:
http://i.imgur.com/Quzbf.jpg

What you need:

* 2 x MFFS Card &lt;Blank&gt;
* 1 x MFFS Extractor (far left on image)
* 1 x MFFS Capacitor (Middle Left)
* 1 x MFFS Converter (Middle Right)
* 1 x MFSU
* 1 x Lever


4 x Optic Fibre Cable (or similar). (technically you dont have to use any as MFFS is all ""wireless"")


1. Place them however you like but make sure to put the MFSU next to the MFFS Converter. 

2. Right click the converter and change it to 512 EU output and turn on the switch. 

3. Right click the capacitor twice with the two blank cards and then place one into the converter and one into the extractor.

4. Place your forcicium into the extractor. 

5. Seed the MFSU with about 10k EU from a power source (ie Lappack) 

6. Watch the power roll in.


Now what you can do is make even more of these extractors and link them to the capacitor to generate EU even faster. I have another setup that has generated over 100million EU within the last 20 mins and each one still has over 50 forcicium in them... http://i.imgur.com/IwwW9.png

1362466054.0,82,self.feedthebeast,19p0j8,(Tutorial) Getting started in Gregtech (Part 1),ultradolp,97,15,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/19p0j8/tutorial_getting_started_in_gregtech_part_1/,"The ultimate pack is out. As I believe many of us will be playing it. For those who are not familiar with Gregtech (direwolf pack did not have it), you may be afraid to look into it (and IC2 staff) because of the controversy of Gregtech rises here and there.

I am not going to discuss whether it is good or bad (well, it is both good AND bad), I am here to give all newbie who want to have awesome machines a basic guide. For any experienced folk, chances are you know more than me.

A short introduction of my ftb experience: I started playing the beta pack ~6 months ago, then I played a bit of Mindcrack pack on single player. Now I am hosting a private server with my friend on the Mindcrack pack. In the server, I go with the new Forestry staff, get some thermal expansion machine, now having hell lot of fun in Gregtech. So far I only touched some mid-tier Gregtech machines so my advice will be solely on how to get started.

Before going into Gregtech. I would assume you have some basic machine setup and resources. If you are starting brand new, you can try look for a ftb starter guide (I can make one if requested). The threshold of getting into Gregtech is not as hard as you may think of. In fact, I did a IC2/Gregtech only start in my single player and I would say definitely possible.

Key resources you will need (in the order):

* Iron

YES! Iron is the material you will most likely run out of. In fact, you will ALWAYS be short of iron, for reason later discussed. You will need around **200 iron** to get some mid-tier machine going. But you may ask ""Hey! that is hell lot of reources!"" True, but assuming you have a pulverizer/macerator already, that is around a stack and a half of iron ore. This is not that a big leap from other mod, say thaumcraft (you will need many resources for research), forestry (bronze anyone?). 

* Rubber and copper

Surprisingly, you do not really need that much of them. Each electric circuit takes 6 rubber and 3 copper if you are using the standard IC2 recipe. But no fear, Gregtech offers you a lot of alternative. The most notable one is Electrum! With electrum you only need 1.5 copper for each electric circuit, or 0.75 for each advanced circuit. **A stack or so of copper and rubber** will be sufficient for most cases. A few rubber sapling (exploration in swamp/forest will get enough of those) with extractor you will never run out of rubber.

* Coal

Coal is important ingredient for advanced machine block, a vital component of many gregtech machine. Reason I list this so late is that you always have enough coal by the time you get enough iron/copper. Mine every vein you see will yield you more than enough for quite a while. Remember later when you have silk touch, coal ore is more efficient for your usage so you may as well hold on after a few stack of coal.

* Charcoal, Gold and Silver

Self-explanatory. Charcoal as fuel in furnace and generator (build a few if you have spare resources, since generator is a component for advanced generators). Gold and silver saves your copper usage as each gold and silver gives 2 electrum ingot.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Key machines you will need:

* IC2: Extractor (rubber), Compressor (Alloy and coal plate), Macerator (if you do not have pulverizer), Batbox and MFE (you want 2+ MFE for most of your usage)

* TE: Pulverizer (if you do not have macerator), redstone energy cell + conduit (vital for quarry)

* Railcraft: Rolling machine (a must if you want to have any progression)

* Redpower: Alloy furnace (Another niche that saves your copper usage! Brass uses half of copper as bronze and is a valid material for mixed metal alloy. No more copper shortage.)

* A stable supply of MJ and your awesome **OMNIWRENCH**!

Ok guys get all your things packed in a big hollow room? Time to make the very first Gregtech machine: Industrial Centrifuge.

Ind. Centrifuge is a LV machine (which means you want a batbox/LV-transformer for it) that makes many useful material. Depending on what resources you have access to, you can get a lot of useful staff out of it.

List of very very useful recipe for Ind. Centrifuge that you may want to mark it down on a paper:

* 16 Lava + 50,000 EU  EU-&gt; 2 tin + 4 copper (yay!) + 1 electrum (yay!) + 0.25 Tungsten dust

Infamous lava centrifuge! The new recipe takes into consideration of the cell usage means you will never lose tin for it, only at the expense of 50% more EU. 16 Lava instead of 64 lava now means it is very easy to start up a centrifuge. Lava can be found from underground, nether, or your magma crucible. If you are in need of some copper/tin/electrum, turn on this baby and you are good.

* 16 Cracked Sand + 1 Fuel can + 12,500 EU-&gt; 10 saltpeter dust + sand + Filled fuel can

No body likes wasteland right? Well not for Greg Tech folk. Cracked sand centrifuge provides the easiest access to saltpeter dust, which is very useful for a lot of staff later on. Bonus of it is that a filled fuel can generate 25k EU in a generator and gives u the empty can back. Simple maths tell us this centrifuge actually generate EU for you. Though without automation you will need to pull out the can once in a while (thank you for pointing it out)

* 8 Marble Dust -&gt; 7 Calcite Dust + 1 Magnesium Dust

Tired of a barrel of marble? Macerate and centrifuge them! you may wonder why do you need calcite dust (no one cares about the Mg you get right?), answer is: Calcium Carbonate cell (calcite dust+empty cell) triples your iron output in industrial blast furnace. Did I say we are short of iron? With this trick, you will be ok... well sorry, you will still be short of iron

Remember that Ind. centrifuge only takes 5 EU/t and most of the tasks are incredibly slow. If you have spare resources you may want to get a few of them.

Next machine to be introduced is Industrial Blast Furnace. ""But hey, why do I need these bease which takes 100+ iron when I can get a blast furnace up easily?"" Correct and incorrect, but I will save the discussion for next part =D

edit: Centrifuging Lava and Lava cells yields the same amount of resources in latest patch. Centrifuging lava cell takes 50% more EU though

1368567341.0,80,self.feedthebeast,1ecanb,"Open-source mod pack: One mod, one team",IrishStevo,92,12,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ecanb/opensource_mod_pack_one_mod_one_team/,"There's a TL;DR at the end of this for anyone not wanting to read this wall of text without some context.

Another redditor posted a while back suggesting that FTB should have an open-source pack, where only open-source mods would be included (http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1bkh1f/interest_in_a_fosm_free_open_source_mods_pack/). I thought this was a great idea, especially in light of recent events that may result in one of my favorite mods Redpower getting dropped from FTB.

This situation with Redpower is sometimes referred to by developers as the bus factor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Basically, how much does a project suffer if an individual developer were to get hit by a bus? Of course it doesn't have to be a bus - it can be your job, your family, your health, boredom etc. It's a real problem, not just here within our community but in software projects everywhere.

This got me thinking that FTB might benefit from taking the open-source idea one step further. What if FTB had a mod pack that was made up of just one open-source mod worked on by a team of developers? So rather than have many open-source mods worked on by individual teams in different code repositories that are then merged together, there was one repository where a much bigger mod team works together and the result gets released as a single mod.

Below is a list of the pros/cons I can think of, though I'm sure there are ones I've missed:

Positives

- Reduced Bus Factor: If any member of the team gets too busy in real-life, gets sick or whatever, then the mod development will not halt. Other team members can step in and take over.
- Balance: All aspects of the mod can be balanced by the team working together rather than individual mod developers making separate decisions.
- Consistency: The block GUIs will look the same, there only needs to be one power unit and one tube/pipe system, one type of tin and copper.
- Quality: With more than one set of eyes on the code, you would end up with a much higher quality mod and less chance of bugs slipping through the cracks. This can be further enhanced by using a GitHub process called a pull request, where all code must be reviewed by a second developer before it gets added. This process can also help with balance, consistency and learning.
- Update Speed: When a new version of MC gets released, the team can all shift to getting the mod updated to be compatible. This compatibility update could even be done without waiting for any new mod development that was going on if you use development practices like forks and branches.
- Learning: Working in a team is one of the best ways to become a better developer. You also now have a team of other developers to rely on when you hit a bug or problem you can't solve. Some of the mods are created by very talented junior developers who may also benefit from working in a team environment, something they will end up doing a lot in their day job.

Negatives

- Credit: Some developers enjoy the kudos that comes from developing their own mod. That lessens when working in a team.
- Variety: Some players like that FTB has multiple power units and transport systems because it adds variety to the game.
- Missed opportunities: Large featured mods like Twilight Forest or Mystcraft may never make it in to the mod because the amazingly creative developers who come up with these types of idea may not be part of the team.
- Effort: It would be a lot of work to get the initial version up and running. The idea would be to start from scratch, though I've been arguing with myself over this point. There are pros and cons to starting from scratch. There might be opportunities to use existing mods as a starting point though, if the developers of those mods were open to the idea.

There are some great examples in the software industry of this concept working well. One close to my heart is Zend Framework, where a team of PHP developers worked together to create a very powerful open-source platform that I have used in a variety of software projects.

Just so you know that I'm not talking completely out of my ass, here are some brief credentials. I've a developer by day, with 18 years experience in the software industry. I've worked on small and big teams, I've lead small and big projects, and I've managed developers with a range of skill levels. A lot of what I've written above comes from my experiences about what has worked and what hasn't, including things I've learned from the mistakes that I've made.

TL;DR I think the FTB community could benefit from an open-source mod pack consisting of one fully featured mod worked on by a team of developers that would provide a reliable, consistent and balanced game.

For those not aware, the end is 100% devoid of vis; you will never find a node there. Thus, it served to be the perfect place to test some things. Here's some of the things I found out that others might find useful. If you want to know how I tested something (for reasons such as to test it yourself), just ask.

* Crystal clusters can only raise a node's vis by 10% of its max.

* Crystal clusters don't cause flux. At all. None.

* A node with more vis than its max (""overcharged"") generates flux. This is only possible via crystal clusters (capacitors won't give a node more than 100%).

* The flux generated by an overcharged node appears to be completely random, with a heavy bias towards the ""flux"" essence.

* A pure node will have absolutely no trouble keeping up with this 'overcharged' flux generation, as long as there's nothing else generating flux.

* Unstable nodes generate every element as flux, whereas dark nodes only generate malum and mortuus.

* You can't get above 100 of any one element of flux.

* When a wisp spawns, it lowers a random element's flux by 10. 

* I have no idea how vis is made outside of crystal clusters. I can't get my end node to regenerate at all without assistance.

* Your crucible can hold 500 total essentia before it starts spilling.

* Silverwoods only need between 50-100 vis to grow. Nailing this down is difficult.

* Placing a block in the same space as a node will prevent wisps from spawning.

* Each infused ore only seems to regenerate the nearest node by 10 points before becoming depleted. They also take 10 vis to replenish themselves, returning to whatever they were before.

* Bug? Infused ore wouldn't update graphically to dull ore without exiting and returning.

Edits:

* I [overcharged](http://i.imgur.com/ZT80UsB.png) a node to an extreme (as high as it would let me) and not only did I not get spontaneous infused ore (at all), but the pure node was no longer able to keep up with flux generation.

This is a self post so I do not get any karma.**

Hello FTB community.

Recently I have made some Mystcraft ages and found out that due to a bug, ages do **not** generate according to your symbols. This only happens in singleplayer. 

For instance, you write an age with a single biome lava ocean and you get a tiled snow/mushroom biome.

[I have googled around a bit](http://binarymage.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5109#p5109) and have found a workaround for this.

 

-------------------------------------------

 


Short said, you do this: 

I. Write your age as how you want it.  
II. Visit the age once(and notice it does not generate properly), then return to Overworld.

III. Shut down FTB and go to the corresponding DIM_MYST folder of that age in your saves folder.   
[Example](http://i.imgur.com/veFV1pS.png).

IV. In the 'region' folder, delete **all** .mca and .mcr files.

V. Start your game and enter the age again.

There is a small bug where you crash upon re-entering the game after deleting the files, but this shouldn't do any harm. Simply quit and restart the game, and your age will generate properly!

 

-------------------------------------------

 





**Edit: It appears to be a bug specific to FTB and *not* Mystcraft itself. Thanks to darkinnit for mentioning this.**

I've been playing FTB, and when I scroll through NEI I see some really useful items that aren't well knows, so I'm compiling a big list of some of the most underrated useful items. Feel free to comment and add!

1: Deep Storage Unit (Minefactory reloaded). This is a cheap item. only requires some rubber, ender pearls, and a blaze rod to make. It stores 2  billion of any one item, like a quantum chest. This is good mid-early game for mob traps or to store cobblestone. Did I mention you get 4 of them?

2: Mining well.(Buildcraft) Good very early game powered by stirling engines to get a bit of mining automation. Also, if you're new to ftb, gives you a grasp of how pipes work.

3: Rubber boots.(IC2) Also good early game to negate a lot of fall damage for just some rubber and wool. They don't last very long, but still, no one wants to end a hardcore world by dying from fall damage.

4: Seed bag.(Redpower) Very good if you're a farmer or you have a big farm. Sickles and seed bags are a great combo.

5: Engineers overalls:(Railcraft) Pretty sweet looking.

6: Hazmat suit.(IC2) Orange dye and rubber for lava and fire immunity. Yes please. Good for first nether trip, or caving in a cave with a lot of lava, Also you can survive shocks from superconductors.

7: Scaffolds.(IC2) Ladders that don't rely on a block in front of them, and when you knock out the first one you placed they all fall down.

8: Salamanders eye. (Xeno's Reliquary) It's an item that gives you full fire and lava immunity for a fairly cheap price.

1369794830.0,74,self.feedthebeast,1f8s7a,What I will miss from RedPower.,TheThirdPerson_is,88,14,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1f8s7a/what_i_will_miss_from_redpower/,"Considering that Redpower's future is, at best... *uncertain*... I started to think about what it is from Redpower that I really use and will miss. I took a good look at the item list from that mod and I've ended up surprising myself in regards to how much Redpower I actually use. To start off, here's some things I will not miss:

**Pneumatic tubes:** They are lovely and fantastic and they ""just work"" for the most part. That very first upgrade from buildcraft pipes to pneumatic tubes was magical, and they made my first real sorting system possible. I won't miss them though. They are laggy, the machines that make them work also cause a lot of taxing block updates, and unless you want to invest in the magtube infrastructure they are quite slow. The final nail in the pneumatic tube coffin, however, is Applied Energistics. I think FTB has outgrown standard storage options, and AE is THE storage/automation mod for FTB at this point.

**Logic blocks:** I was fascinated with these when I first started playing with them, and the idea behind them is fantastic, but I will not miss them. After some initial experimentation I have realized that I never build anything in FTB that requires complex logic. If I do it's logic revolving around item movement using BC pipes, and only then if AE doesn't fit the bill. It's just... if you want to do complex automation in FTB, there's computercraft. Why redstone logic?

**Microblocks:** I love these! These would be in the missed items list if it weren't for one thing: there is an alternative that already works. Thanks Immibis!

Now for a few things that I actually WILL miss. I would love to see some replacement options for the following:

**Canvas bags:** Sure some servers won't even let you make these because of the dupe bug, but come on. A whole extra inventory for some string. I carry like four of them all the time, colored and named, to keep my personal inventory managable and clean. I will miss these dearly, and while Ender pouches and the forestry bags offer some respite from my bag-less world... they just aren't the same. Cheap, easy, effective... I will miss my canvas bags.

**Flax:** Speaking of canvas, I will miss my lovely string-producing flax quite a lot. Not just because it makes the bags easy to produce, but also because I no longer have to keep sheep for anything. I don't have to farm spiders just so I can make some bee frames. I don't have to drop what I'm doing when a recipe calls for string and spend the next ten minutes trying to scrounge a quarter stack from spiders/mines. I remember the first flax plant I harvested... I saw the string pop out and thought to myself ""Well this changes everything...""

**Project tables:** It was only recently that I realized this was actually part of the redpower mod. Sure AE has the crafting terminal, but it is slow and clunky. I love the ability to go on a crafting binge with my 20 labelled project tables and have everything easy to reach and easy to get put together. These take up fully 1/4 of the floorspace in my workshop. I have not found a suitable alternative.

**Red alloy wire:** It just makes getting a redstone signal from point A to point B as easy as it should be, and nothing more.

**Frames:** Yeah, here's the big one. I love frames. I want to make large things that move. I want frame elevators, frame doors, frame bores, and frame ships. Such a neat and revolutionary idea, to take this otherwise rather static game and allow the creation of whole structures that MOVE. I hope someone figures this out soon.

**Worldgen:** Not really an item per se, but I will miss my volcanoes, marble floors, and easy rubies.

So that's where I'm at with what I think are the highlights of the mod (Notable exception: Sickles. I've embarrassingly never used one), and I sort of surprised myself when I realized that I'm not as ready to let go of redpower as I thought. Does anybody know of any work being done by other modders to replace some of what we might lose?",,False,self,t5_2v620,1369796900.0,,,True,t3_1f8s7a,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1f8s7a/what_i_will_miss_from_redpower/,

This is so much easier!"" moments in FTB. I just had one myself, so I figured I'd share, and encourage others to as well.

Scaffolds + Wand of Equal Trade = much easier upwards building. I'm making a round tower, so I couldn't use a filler effectively. Then I remembered when you left click on scaffolds with another scaffold in your hand, it places on top in stack. The wand of equal trade is an incredibly useful building tool from Thaumcraft that lets you exchange blocks in your inventory with blocks in the world, saving you the trouble of tearing down and rebuilding. The combination is quite nice.

For those who haven't heard of OpenPeripheral, it's a mod which turns all sorts of blocks from all different mods into peripherals. You just stick a computer down next to the block and you can instantly start calling functions on it as you would any other peripheral.

The list of mods it supports is huge, and growing all the time.

However, I've just released a new feature that I'm very excited about. They're called Terminal Glasses.

You stick a Terminal Bridge block next to a computer, hook up some glasses to your bridge, then you can start sending boxes and text to your glasses.

Think.. Google Glasses, but for minecraft.

It's best shown using videos:

Here's a small app monitoring IC2 energy storage units:

Here's a simple arrow counter:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUNrjNkRBiY

It's brand new, so not many videos out there yet - but I know some people are working on some really exciting things, such as displaying tweets on the screen, making mini-maps, making game scoring systems and more. I'm excited to see what people come up with.

A powerful feature is that if you're wearing terminal glasses, you can type chat commands which your computer can receive, so you could easily make some really nice things. For example, if you type ""$$energy"" it could display energy readings from across your base, or if you typed ""$$stock redstone"" it could show how redstone you've got stored.

Anyway, here's the release thread with a lot more information and some of the supported mods:

Your AE system being so performant you don't have anything to do, at such a point that the game doesn't even need you anymore? Sick of your 87th world you generate because you have already done EVERYTHING on the last 86 ones? Then here is a fun concept to try out for yourself:


It's called [the creator](http://www.mediafire.com/?hcwyl4hxta38b4a). It's simple, really. You spawn in a void land, absolutely 0 blocks generated through worldgen. No bedrock, nothing. Just void (and *maybe* something more). The weather is similar to the overworld's one.


Here are the rules:


- You start in survival mode, in the mentionned age. If by any means you happen to spawn in the overworld, teleport to (0, 140, 0) to find the descriptive age book.

- You start with in your inventory: 99 pieces of UU-matter, nothing else. In the age you have only three blocks around you: a crafting bench and the highest tier of solar panel with a Matter fabricator full of scrap boxes. You have to use **wisely** your UU matter to generate yourself your own world. The matter fabricator is there to help for your mistakes, 99 UU is already enough to get a good start.

- You cannot use the given solar panel to other means than the matter fabricator.


- You can create Myscraft ages (the world itself was created through Mystcraft which might give you a hint on how to create other worlds). But only to the following conditions: you can only go **once** to a given world and you cannot stay more than 30 minutes in it. You can however create as many worlds as you want and keep chuncks loaded in there. Remember that getting back what you put in other worlds can be tricky given you can only go once there.


I wish you good luck, so far I've been playing this map for hours and I've been using mods and features in a way I never thought I would!

The unit of power in IC2 is the Energy Unit, or EU. EU's travel around the power grid in packets. **The size of a packet is the voltage and is commonly called EU/p.**

Extreme low voltage is 0 to 5 eu/p. Low voltage is 5 to 32 eu/p. Medium voltage is 32 to 128 eu/p. High voltage is 128 to 512 eu/p. Extreme voltage is 512 to 2048 eu/p.

IC2 cables have a max voltage. If a packet larger than its max enters a cable, the cable will melt.

Tin cables can take extreme low voltage, copper can carry low votage, gold carries medium, glass fiber carries high, and high voltage cable can take up to extreme voltage.

**As EU packets travel along a cable they will lose energy** and eventually disapear. The rate of loss is different for each type of cable. The following list assumes max insulation:

Packets on tin cables lose 1 eu every 40th block, copper cables lose 1 every 5th block, gold cables lose 1 per 2.5 blocks, glass fiber losses 1 per 40, and high voltage loses 1 ever 1.25 blocks.

IC2 machines also have a max voltage they can accept. For most machines this is low voltage. A transformer upgrade will increase the tier of voltage a machine can accept by one per upgrade. If a packet larger than a machine's max voltage gets to the machine, the machine will explode.

**Multiple packets may travel down a cable or into a machine per game tick. This is the total current or EU/t. Increasing the current will not melt a wire or explode a machine, but increasing the voltage will.**

IC2 Generators output different sized packets. Water mills vary between .25 and 2. Solar panels make 1 eu/t when its not night. Windmills can make up to 11.5, but have a chance to break when they output a packet greater than 5. Generator output 10 eu/p. Geothermal generators output 20 eu/p. Finally nukes are capable of making somewhere in the neighborhood of 4000 ish eu/t, but I'd not recommend setting one up that way unless you want to turn your base into a big hole in the ground.

IC2 Transformers, in the absence of a redstone signal, will take the power input in its 3 dot side and output up to four packets. So a medium voltage line carrying a total 128 eu/t into the 3 dot side of a low voltage transformer, will be out put in 4 low voltage (32eu/p) packets at the same current of 128 eu/t. Alternatively if you have 128 solar panels making 1 eu/p into a line hitting the 3 dot side, you'd still get 128 eu/t but it is now in 4 packets of 32 eu/p instead.

Adding a restone signal to a transformer will cause it to upconvert the power it recieves from the 1 dot sides and output a single higher voltage packet to the 3 dot side.",,False,self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,t3_1ad5d0,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1ad5d0/a_primer_to_ic2_power/,

1362291379.0,68,self.feedthebeast,19kd6h,400+ MJ/tick Cactus Biofuel Factory built within 1 chunk (16x16 block area),Berserkenstein,73,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/19kd6h/400_mjtick_cactus_biofuel_factory_built_within_1/,"So I decided to make a new world when the last direwolf20 patch came out and wanted to see how much self-sustainable power you could get out of a one chunk area.  

I'm a fan of biofuel and the railcraft boilers and engines, so
I was thinking about would make a nice compact biomass source to use. 

I remembered this vanilla [cactus farm vid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSEfu7nge5Q) I saw made by Xisumavoid about a year ago.

At the time I didn't think it was very useful since there isn't much use for cactus in vanilla besides dye and hurting things/destroying items, but now there is biofuel!

I used a quarry to make an 11x11 hole to bedrock and used a filler to build a tower to the build cap (ly = 255) and built the cactus farm inside.  I set aside some of the bottom area to build a processing area and used the remaining area to build boilers, engines and some other machines.

At first I built one fermenter and 4 stills, but the cactus tower was producing more cactus than the fermenter could handle, so I built another fermenter and 2 more stills for a total of 2 fermenters and 6 stills.  

I started out with one 36 HP boiler running 18 industrial steam engines (144 mj/tick).  I eventually added 3 more boilers and 54 more industrial steam engines for a total of 576 mj/tick.  

The system ran three 36 HP boilers just fine with surplus biofuel coming in.  I thought it could handle four boilers, however it became apparent that the system was slowly draining more biofuel than was being produced.  

The goal was to make a self-sustaining system in one chunk, so three boilers (432 mj/tick) was be the max.  

I also added a small wheat farm so I could use the seeds to make dirt and combine it with the wheat to make compost to fuel the fermenters with IC2 windmills to supply the power for a macerator and compressor.    I changed the wheat processing to make plantballs instead of compost in the video to burn all the apatite I had found. 

TL;DR

A vanilla automatic cactus farm tower can be used to produce enough biofuel to provide over 400 mj/tick with three 36 HP railcraft boilers/engines, self sufficiently within a one chunk area.

1355914839.0,64,self.feedthebeast,153r0g,[Tutorial] A Step-by-Step guide for How to Import Existing Minecraft Maps as Mystcraft Ages.,Levy_Wilson,80,16,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/153r0g/tutorial_a_stepbystep_guide_for_how_to_import/,"Surprisingly, there isn't much in the way of detailed information regarding the process behind importing existing worlds into saves as ages, or at least none that I've found. I will attempt to go through the process step by step so you can take on the process as painlessly as possible.

**For all of you who have found this post from the future**, this process is working for Mystcraft 0.9.4.05 and previous versions. XCompWiz has been working hard on overhauling Mystcraft, lately. So I cannot be certain if this will still work in the future.

1. Load up the save you want the age to be in. Make a new descriptive book. Take note of the age number. Now, you need to spawn in a creative notebook for a specific symbol not available for regular ages, the Native Biome Controller symbol. Plonk the creative notebook in a writing desk, along with your new descriptive book.

2. Now, you need to add specific symbols to make the world as overworld-like as possible. At the bottom of this post there are symbols settings I nabbed from [this](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/most-overworld-like-mystcraft-world.4069/) forum post that fit the bill for overworld-like ages. When you're done, don't visit the age. Just quit the game and close the client. We're done with Minecraft for now.

3. Go into your save folder. There won't be a folder for the new age you made, yet. Let's make this real quickly. Just make a folder entitled ""DIM_MYST##"" where ## is the number of the age you made. This is where you place the ""data"" folder and the ""region"" folder from the world you want import. Just copy those over. *[I suggest first loading that world up and depositing your inventory in a chest, otherwise you won't see your items again. Also take note of coordinates in your world for specific bases if you don't have an Overworld transit system. You cannot have a nether within a Mystcraft age.]*

4. Now we are getting into the serious editing. Download a program called [NBTExplorer](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/840677-nbtexplorer-nbt-editor-for-windows-and-mac/). We will use this for changing the age's settings so it matches the world you want to import. Open the level.dat from the world you want to import with NBTExplorer. Copy the seed number and the spawn coordinates. Ignore the player data, just use the spawn coordinates in the Data folder. It should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/7AfCF.png).

5. Go into the game save that you want to import the world into. In the ""data"" folder, there should be a file called ""agedata_##"" where ## is the number of the age you initially created in step 1. Load that up in NBTExplorer. It should contain the symbols you added to the book.

6. First, change the Visited tag to 1, this will ensure no additional random symbols are added when we visit the age at the end of all this. Edit the seed tag to the number you copied in step 4.

7. There aren't spawn tags yet, let's change that. Highlight the ""data"" directory in NBTExplorer. Now click [this icon](http://i.imgur.com/YfVmR.png). The first tag will be ""SpawnX"". Create two more for ""SpawnY"" and ""SpawnZ"". Then add the proper coordinates to each tag. It should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/3Euxe.png) when you are done. Save the edits, then close NBTExplorer.

That should be it, then. Load up Minecraft, go to your save, and visit the age. You will spawn in at the actual spawn of the world. The terrain will be the same and anything you've made in the past will be there. From here on out, this world will act just like a Mystcraft age.

Those are my recommended symbols, you can change it up if you want, even make it a void world if you don't want new terrain to generate. But I do suggest keeping the Native Biome Controller set for consistency.

If you have any questions or are stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help. Also, feel free to experiment with symbols, maybe try to import a Nether save or a custom map.

**Important stuff here, read it first!**

Good day to all of you.

I have noticed that alot of people are still unfamiliar with how bee breeding works, and I'm here to explain it for you as best I can.

If you want me to add something, change something or any the sorts, feel free to leave a comment.

My knowledge might be limited slightly, I'm not a full expert on forestry and bee keeping, but I know some of the mechanics behind it.

***

So, you installed Forestry, and you want to get started with bee breeding.

Well, first things first, you're going to completely ignore bees, although you can collect the bees you find in the wild.

Yup, early game you can't do bee breeding until you get a couple of machines and some buildcraft power.

The first machine you will need is a carpenter.

http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Carpenter

This machine will allow you to create several nifty items and machines that you will need for beekeeping.

You will also need a squeezer.

http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Squeezer

This machine will allow you to squeeze that lovely seed oil (which means you'll also need a decent wheat farm) for the apiaries you'll be making!

http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Apiary

*^Also, ^make ^a ^beealyzer ^in ^the ^carpenter ^as ^soon ^as ^you ^can.*

*^http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Beealyzer*

Here it finally is, the base of all bee breeding.

The way the Apiary works is you place a princess bee in the top slot, and a drone in the bottom slot on the left. You will see the progress bar slowly go up, and when it's done, the drone disappears, and you get a [x] Queen.

While the bee is in it's Queen stage, you can't do much with it except let it produce things. You can manipulate it's genes with extra bees machines, but sadly, it won't give it's children the same genetics.

Oh boy, we got to the genetics part. Yup, it gets complicated from here.

So, how bees and their genetics work is basically like this. If you keep a purebred princess and drone working (purebred is where both inactive and active species genes are the same) not much will happen. You're just going to keep getting the same bees over and over. However, if you put, for example, a Meadows purebred princess in the Apiary with a purebred Forest drone, you have a random chance of mutation. Now, not every combination will give you a random chance on a certain species, you have to find the right combinations. Meadows and Forest combination gives a chance to get Common bees.

But what happens when you get bees with active and inactive species that are different? Well, you have to keep properly breeding them to gain the purebred of the bee your going for.

Let's take a princess with a Meadows active gene, and a Common inactive gene, and a drone with Common active, and Forest inactive.

What are our chances to get a common purebred here?

Well, 50%. Both bees carry the common gene, and the other two have a 25% chance, as they only have 1 gene on each bee.

Now I'm not going to tell you how to get every bee in the game. There's plenty of sites, forums etc where they have every way listed. If you still want to, there's a list on the feed the beast wiki.

Beekeeping is part luck, part experimentation and a whole lot of patience.

Also, if you want to easily keep track of your bees, I like to use computers from computercraft as a way to keep track of which I have. I have a full list of every bee (including extra bees) there is (not the way to get them) on pastebin for you guys, so just slap it in a computer and you're good to go. :)

http://pastebin.com/bB2rebzZ

(X = Yes or No, whether you have the bee or not. Feel free to expand on it)

For the people that don't know how to put a pastebin program into a computer without typing it over completely:

*pastebin get [pastebin code]*

So, for my list:

Lets see some 45 step machines that only produce cobblestone or a power setup that some how manages to consume diamonds but is only able to light a 9 x 9 room.

**Basic ground rules:** (suggestions welcome)

    1: The systems goal should be to create one block of cobble. 

*Don't hold yourself to this one if you have a better idea.

    2: The block of cobble must be created by the system, not simply placed by it. 

    3: A step is counted whenever an item is created, changes into something else, or is consumed.

    4: Anything produced by the system must be used in at least two steps. 

*IE all products of a centrifuge must be used for something not trashed. Even if its as simple as extracting from cells to make empty ones or filling an inventory to create a redstone signal. 

    5: Any FTB pack or mod therein can be used.

    6: The resulting cobble must be placed in the world by the system.

At the time, BuildCraft did one thing: Pipes. It had a pipe to extract from inventories, a pipe to transport stuff, a pipe to route things, and a pipe to sort things. These are the fundamental concepts of item transportation in MineCraft. But with these basic tools, you could build extremely useful, very powerful designs. The idea was simple, but the implications were huge.

BuildCraft has always been a mod that's about doing simple things, but making those simple things very powerful. And that's the point I'd like to make. It's better to add mechanics than devices. BuildCraft added the item transport mechanic (and later the liquid transport one).

Most mods nowadays take a different approach. They make things whose power is proportional to the resources it takes to build them and run them. They just make *things*. Not mechanics. Not things that require the user to think.

A good example is GregTech. GregTech adds a lot of devices that are expensive, but it doesn't add any new ways of thinking. It basically gives you a list of machines, and says that you need to pump power, liquids, and items to the right spots at the right time. You have to do the math to figure out how much of what goes where, but even that is made very easy with AE because of its ability to route so precisely and easily.

I was excited to see steam showing up in RailCraft when they first started doing that. I was hoping for some new kinetic types of mechanics. Moving parts with pressurized steam and having those parts do things or make other things do things. Stuff like that. But it's basically just been turned into a liquid power source.

RedPower 2 brought us a new mechanic that we call frames. And people *loved* that. ComputerCraft brought a new one in the way of adding logic to a world without big redstone contraptions. Tinkers Construct added the mechanic of modular tools and liquidizing metals.

I haven't seen very many new mechanics come out of the modding community in recent times. Just machines that do stuff for you if you pipe in the right resources into its inventories. To me, that's just a shame.",,False,self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,t3_1iqkxt,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1iqkxt/a_concept_people_and_especially_mod_authors/,

Apologies if something explaining this has already been posted, and if my results are different to yours, let me know.

From what I've gathered, the basic way bees work is that they progress in ticks, just like everything else in the game. However, a ""bee tick"" is a lot different from a regular game tick. A ""bee tick"" happens every 550 regular ticks, or every 27.5 seconds. Which is why it takes a while between anything happening when it comes to apiculture.

Bee ticks determine three things; 1) How long a queen produces for before dying, 2) How long a frame lasts in an apiary or a frame housing, and 3) The maximum yield of any bee (a bee can at most produce two of its regular products and one of its specialty per bee tick).

For the lifespan gene, there are nine alleles (from shortest life to longest life); shortest, shorter, short, shortened, normal, elongated, long, longer and longest. Each allele confers a ""durability"" to the queen, which is measured in bee ticks.

So if a queen starts with the Long lifespan trait (which gives it 50 bee ticks of durability), every bee tick (27.5 seconds), it loses one durability, until it reaches zero, at which point it dies and you get the offspring. The same thing happens with frames, except they vanish once their durability hits zero.

Here's a list of what I've calculated the durabilities to be (measured in bee ticks).

Lifespan genes:

Shortest; 10.

Shorter; 20.

Short; 30.

Shortened; 35.

Normal; 40.

Elongated; 45.

Long; 50.

Longer; 60.

Longest; 70.

As for the durability of frames:

Untreated, Soul; 16.

Metabolic; 24.

Gentle; 40.

Magic, Impregnated, Chocolate, Healing, Restraint, Nova; 48.

Necrotic; 54.

Temporal; 60.

Proven; 144.

Resilient; 168.

To calculate how many seconds this is, just multiply the ""durability"" by 27.5. For example, a Resilient Frame will last for 4620 seconds (77 minutes), and a bee with the ""Lifespan: Long"" gene will last for 1375 seconds (22 minutes, 55 seconds).

If lifespan-affecting frames (like Soul Frames or Gentle Frames) need to be considered to calculate the lifespan of your bees, remember that their effects stack. I'll give an example here to help out.

Say you've got a bee with the ""Longest"" lifespan trait (e.g., Relic bees), and you've thrown in two Chocolate frames and a Gentle Frame in your apiary to boost its productivity. You'll be getting combs at (1 + 50%) * (1 + 50%) * (1 + 40%) the normal rate (3.15x). However, instead of the usual 70 bee ticks of life you'd get, you instead get

70 * (1 - 50%) * (1 - 50%) * (1 + 50%) = 70 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 1.5 = 26.25

which rounds up to 27 bee ticks. So your Relic bee will die quicker than a non-frame-affected bee with the Short lifespan trait (30 bee ticks).

Hope this information is consistent with whatever you might find, and, if it is, I hope it helps with all you bee-breeders out there. I'm currently working to decipher the productivity mechanic, which I think will be a lot more useful.

EDIT: Just finished working out the productivity multiplier, thanks to yky2458's links down below. The magic number is a 328x multiplier for getting platinum comb (which takes the longest) down from 2.5hrs to 27.5 seconds. Getting the 328x multiplier means you're guaranteed to get two of each regular product and one of each specialty comb every bee tick for every bee. 

You get a 1.2x multiplier for using an alveary, and a multiplicative 2x multiplier for each untreated, impregnated or proven frame. After factoring in the base production speed for each productivity allele (found in yky2458's ""Speed"" link), I've found that;

Slowest productivity bees need 10 frames.

Slower, Slow and Normal bees need 9 frames.

Fast, Faster and Fastest bees need 8 frames.

So there you go! You now know how to maximise the productivity of all your bees, and exactly how long everything bee-related lasts for.",,False,self,t5_2v620,1366771803.0,,,True,t3_1cx87d,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1cx87d/bee_lifespan_mechanics/,

Hello just thought I would give you all a bit of an update on what is going on here at FTB; the big news this week is that development has started on our next big launcher version, launcher v2 which will bring a total redesign of the launcher as well as new features and more customisability.

A new and improved website adding many of the feature requests and improvements that the community requested has also started development recently which we expect to be released in the next few weeks; here is a sneak preview (feedback appreciated):

[[Image](http://i.imgur.com/W8UjMcJ.jpg)]

In other news work has began on the map for the pax tournament which will be released before pax for anyone wanting to get involved to practice before the tournament. We hope to have the ultimate pack finished **soon**, which is the best estimate we can give so please don’t ask for us a better one! We are currently waiting for a few mods before we release the ultimate pack, we always try our best to make maps forward compatible however this is not always possible.
Most of your worlds will work between packs as we keep id's the same throughout all our packs so you can change easily if you wish. The best packs for forward compatibility with ultimate pack are Direwolf20 or MindCrack, if you want to use greg tech then we recommend you use the MindCrack pack and if not you should use the Direwolf20 pack, there are also other differences between the packs so you should look at the full mod list for both packs on the launcher before making your decision.

First of all, rendering has been completely overhauled, and now is pretty damned close to photographic (in my opinion), and now officially surpasses the rendering capability of old RP2 because nothing is ever drawn as a placeholder anymore, and every mod is supported natively without having to be added to a list. (No, that's not a shot at RP2: It's just a comparison.)

I discovered an item-loss problem with continuous carriages and Buildcraft pipes: When Buildcraft pipes are reloaded (either from a save file, an unloaded chunk that was just reloaded, or by being put down by a carriage), they have a deliberate builtin delay of 2 ticks before they process their items-in-transit. If the carriage moves again immediately without those ticks passing, the items irrevocably disappear. So, I added a mandatory 5-tick (1/4 of a second at normal speed) cooldown on all continuous motion. (This also has the added benefit of giving a small window of being able to interact with the engine each time it moves, so if you have trapped yourself, you can turn it back out of continuous mode with a screwdriver.)

More compatibility with mods too: Keep reporting bugs if you find them!

Also, 16x textures are in, contributed by /u/cubemelon, /u/JustHev, and /u/uberifix. Visit the Technic thread to see screenshots; Edit the config file to select the one you want. Two of the five texture options have increased contrast and use patterns instead of just colours to support colourblind users (though since I'm not colourblind myself, I need people who are to check them to make sure they're suitable for the purpose).",,False,self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,t3_1htbil,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1htbil/15x_redstone_in_motion_massive_update_1200_july_7/,

But I really don't get the FTB community's, and the subreddit's, almost visceral anger toward anything considered ""OP."" I understand wanting a challenge in game, that's basic and makes perfect sense. But I guess what confuses me is how much it seems to bother people. For example, today's post about [Dartcraft being 'OP as Fuck'](http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1j5hpd/dartcraft_op_as_fuck/) seems... genuinely angry, to me, about the high number of nether stars a player can get from a wither with the use of Dartcraft tools and armor in the right combination. 

Here's the thing- the way I see it, Minecraft, with or without mods, is all one big playground where the only rules that matter are the ones you enforce on yourself. Things like NEI or even creative mode mean that ultimately we as players have control over our worlds and ourselves. But I've yet to see a complaint about either being overpowered, let alone with the furor I've seen hurled at other mods. I don't get it. Aren't they the same, in principle? I could get a stack of Nether Stars in a single click, with NEI. The only difference is that I choose not to. That choice is the point of Minecraft, isn't it? If I want to do something, I do it, and that includes if I want to throw a bunch of arbitrary rules at it (ie, let's say in Vanilla I don't think I've 'earned' a bow until I've collected a stack of arrows without one). Point is, I do what I want, and *don't do* what I *don't want.* So... blaming a mod for being OP seems pointless, to me. If you don't like Dartcraft armor when fighting the wither, *don't use Dartcraft armor.*

**TLDR, If you want challenge in Minecraft, then set your own rules and abide by them. That's what Minecraft is all about.**

This is all just my opinion, so I'd love to hear from others and their thoughts. Why is the fascination with OP/Balance so strong here?",,False,self,t5_2v620,False,,,True,t3_1j63zw,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1j63zw/whats_wrong_with_being_overpowered/,

Turns out, there's not a *whole lot* to do out at sea and 6 months is a really long time to be without internet. I'm going to play some serious minecrafts.

I'm looking for project suggestions, and hopefully some resources that I can download to read about the mods while underway. The pack that I'll be using is DW20. Yeah, I know that I could probably get a little more mileage out of something with GregTech, but I'm downloading a copy of my DW20 server's map to play on the patrol - that way we can all compare notes on how our paths diverged during my trip.

**tl;dr - If you were going to be without internet and had a ton of free time for 6 months, what would you want to know about FTB?**

edit: Thanks for all the suggestions! I'll keep monitoring this thread from time to time until my departure.

Another note - I'll have port calls every few weeks, so I can upload galleries of my progress. And hopefully there'll be an update soon that puts Forestry machines back into NEI.

Here's the program:

 * [Reddit Viewer](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/895569/Code/Lua/redditViewer)

Here's the json API you MUST use. It needs to be either in your CC API folder, or on the computer you're running the reddit viewer from as ""json"": 

* [json decoder](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/895569/Code/Lua/json)

Once you have both of those files on your computer, just run 

&gt;""reddit &amp;lt;sub reddit&gt; &amp;lt;number of results&gt;""

Which would look something like 

""reddit feedthebeast 10"" 

to get the top 10 posts in this sub!

Use the arrow keys to navigate; Left + Right to cycle through submissions, Up + Down to scroll each submission.

Are you tired of constantly burning your dear copper cables?

Fret not, there's help!

And what is its name? The adjustable transformer!

Simply place your power storage behind the transformer ( it can handle unlimited eu/t and package size ) eg. an adjustable energy storage unit, set both up, and you can provide 64 packets of 32 eu/t because of only one block. This means you can power an industrial blast furnace, a centrifuge and an electrolyzer from the same power line!

There must be a catch, it's too good to be true. That's probably what you're thinking. Well, no. It's fricking cheap and doesn't require orphan tears to work. Not to forget its interface looks downright sexy.

We quickly found out that the arrows are reusable, and in fact can be used as melee weapons, with infinite durability. 

One thing lead to another, and now there is a stack of cactus arrows tipped in max Quartz that does 7.5 base melee damage (more than a diamond sword) with infinite durability.

I feel this not intended... where do I go about notifying the mod author about this and/or finding out if its a known issue?

I was able to manage it in under 4 hours with almost no infrastructure (just 1 Force Engine, also from DartCraft, and a Pulverizer).  This armor provides better speed and flight than Quantum Armor, allows you to mine non-valuable blocks by hand faster than just about any pick you can make, makes you essentially immune to fall damage (I fell over 50 blocks and took less than half a heart of damage), and lets you kill any mob in one hit (maybe 2 for some, like Angry Endermen).  It seems to have diamond-level damage reduction despite being made out of *leather*, and that's without having the Sturdy modifier on any pieces (which provides 25% damage reduction each, up to 75%).

The tools you get from this aren't much more reasonable.  A pickaxe with Speed V can mine a 3x3 area in a second or two at most in area mode.  You can put Fortune IV on a pickaxe and expect to get ~2-3x yield on average - I was frequently getting 15+ lapis from each block, 5+ coal, etc.  You can put Grinding on a pickaxe and make your Pulverizer obsolete, or Grinding + Smelting to make ore processing itself obsolete.

Edit: a huge issue is how cheap the upgrades are.  That armor required only 4 claws (from bats), 4 sugar, 4 feathers, and 4 fortunes (cookie + paper).

In my opinion, this mod's current state is so unbalanced that it shouldn't have been included in FTB Unleashed.

Personally, I feel strongly enough about free software that I would commit to playing with only free (as in speech) mods. But the major benefit I think is that, without absentee/tyrant maintainers, mod updates can be crowd-sourced, and there will be fewer barriers to making disparate mods compatible and able to inter-operate. Finally, unpopular DRM could not survive, as making a fork without DRM would be trivial.

So who would be willing to play using this mod pack to put pressure on modders? And which are the most popular mods that wouldn't make the cut?

I'm working on a mod about thermodynamics and I'm looking for input.,ElvishJerricco,57,8,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1b0fyy/hey_rfeedthebeast_im_working_on_a_mod_about/,"The core of the mod adds thermodynamics. Heat transfer between blocks (blocks that choose to be heat devices, that is). Heat can be generated by solid fuels, liquid fuels, and power from EUs or MJs. And the heat can be used for some cool stuff.

First there's a heat oven, which smelts large quantities of things at a speed dependent on the temperature of the oven.

Then there's the Cyclone Converter Furnace (based on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIsarna_steelmaking_process)). This originated as a way to produce steel, but now it's got a wider usage. Throw in any metal ore and you'll get *THREE* ingots worth of molten metal. This is just to give it some advantage as it uses huge amounts of heat to melt the metal. And if you don't want to throw in ore to get the molten metal, just put in ingots.

On top of producing molten metals, it's used to mix things into the metals to create other metals such as steel. So if it's got molten iron in there, you put in one coal dust and one ingot worth of molten steel is produced. It's much faster to produce steal this way and it's cheaper on your coal supply.

Then of course there has to be a machine to cool the molten metal down to ingots. The industrial water cooler does this. As you put molten metal, it takes the heat into the hull, raising the block's temperature. Pump in water and you cool it down. This lets the metal freeze back into ingots. Also, you can heat this block with standard heat sources instead of molten metal (the metal is just heating it, after all), and as the water cools the block, the water is heated and turned into steam. This steam can be used just like railcraft steam is used.

Next is the alloy mixer. Pump in two or more molten metals and if they fit a recipe, they'll be mixed to one resulting alloy metal. These will be used for machines in the future and some of them can already be used for armor and tools that's extra durable and long lasting.

But here I'm at a loss. I'm not sure what else to add. I can't think of anything to do with the new metals I'm creating and I can't think of anything else to do with the heat I'm generating. Anyone have any ideas?

Also, I have quite a lot of alloys, and if you name a new one, I'm likely to add it. So use any alloy in your ideas.

EDIT: Also, I played around with the idea of biomes and players having temperatures. The player's temp is affected by the biome temp. If they get too hot or too cold they'll take damage. And there will be ACs and heaters to change the temperature in an area to keep players safe. This sound cool?

EDIT 2: This is some great stuff guys. Thanks!

I was thinking about the lack of information of GregTech the other day, and I figured I'd document the current state of the mod. I realized a lot of people could benefit from my discoveries, so I'm making them public on Youtube. 

So far I've released one video (on power generation), and I'm uploading another that talks about covers. I call the series ""GregTech from Scratch""; I drew inspiration from another video series that teaches you how to play Clair de Lune ([Clair de Lune from Scratch](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23BA4D8592904FB0))

The vid on power generation is here:

The mod not only replicates the original Redpower-style frames, it also adds four (so far) new types, which let you do fancy things like make unidirectional platforms, move entire cuboid sections of the world (like a whole house), or even set up a template pattern (sort of like the Buildcraft style of template) that will move exactly what is in the template and no more.

The mod is open-source and open-community, and feedback is welcomed.

&gt; Explosions are gone, loss over distance is gone.

&gt; Added new Power pipes, Cobble, Quartz and Diamond.

&gt; All pipes have much smaller max throughput:

&gt; * Cobble = 8 MJ/t
&gt; * Stone = 16 MJ/t
&gt; * Wood = 32 MJ/t
&gt; * Quartz = 64 MJ/t
&gt; * Gold = 256 MJ/t
&gt; * Diamond = 1024 MJ/t

&gt; The power display will turn red if a pipe has hit its max capacity. You can use smaller pipes to throttle certain parts of your power net.

&gt; Machines are more lossy now to make up for the lossless pipes. Expect low power draws even when idle.

I'd like to suggest semi-modular liquid-filled armours. Made from hardened glass, electrum, tin, and diamonds, on its own the armour does very little other than a medium amount of protection.

 However, it could gain abilities when each segment of armour is filled with either Energized Glowstone, Resonant Ender, or Destabilized Redstone. It would most likely have different abilities for each piece of armour

For instance, leggings could gain either a knockback reduction/elimination when filled with redstone, a jump enhanced by a  teleport when filled with Ender, or increased sprint speed when filled with glowstone.

Similarly, the helmet could cause a (very minor) regeneration effect, or maybe Strength for redstone, Night vision for glowstone, and some other effect for Ender.

Chestplates could grant a slowfall for Glowstone, enhanced defense for Redstone, and possibly a chance to not take an instance of damage (coupled with an enderman teleport sound) for Ender

Boots, now they could grant fall damage nullification for Glowstone, and... Okay, i don't even know for the others.

Thoughts? Opinions? Suggestions? All are welcome here.
