I sent her a message notifying her of the video being linked here, because I saw it as nothing but bullying. It turns out the person that actually posted it here was supposed to be her friend and the one filming.

She sent me this through YouTube:

""Thanks

I saw the username of the person who put it up, and I'm disappointed that it was my friend, he is also the one who forced me into filming that rhyme video and posting it online.

So don't be a fuckin' ass, bullying is not what this subreddit should be about. Oh and to the guy who deleted it here, guess it bit you back on the ass didn't it?

Edit: some more context [deleted] I removed it because I didnt want people to find her channel.

e: I'm glad this has reached the top of the /r/cringe, hopefully the mods can see this and consider the cancer that is ruining this subreddit.

e: Well apparently, according to some of you, being concerned for bullying/harassment makes me a white knight/moral fag. Cheers!

e: post has been restored. I'm also not going to link her YouTube page to the people asking, I may have a few exceptions for some people although the actual clip in context had already been removed.

Over the course of my time spent here however I couldn't help but notice that some of us are, well, kind of a bunch of dicks when it comes to reacting to the people we cringe over.  It's almost impossible to go to a video posted on this sub and not see it filled with douchey, mean-spirited, venemous comments directed at the poster for seemingly no reason.

For the most part -- at least from what I've seen -- true cringe is almost completely harmless.  Be it some socially awkward kid expounding his love for My Little Pony in front of his classmates, or a middle-aged woman trying to realize her dream of becoming a singer even though she can't sing a note to save her life.  These people aren't hurting anyone, least of all you -- the people who enjoy watching them humiliate themselves.  I guess I can't fathom why anyone would respond with such hostility to someone whose just put something embarassing on the internet.  It's gotten to the point that the cringiest part of a lot of these videos is the sad, misguided comments left by people who are obviously part of this sub.  Can we stop?

EDIT: I think a lot of people are focusing on George Godley.  I suppose the timing of this post was a little off, as I put it up just as GG's e-fame was hitting it's precipice, but as far as I can tell the guy seems like a relatively normal, albeit slightly misguided and delusional adult who's perfectly capable of taking your thinly veiled attempts to make yourself feel better by putting him down.  George Godley isn't the kind of person who's going to stop pursuing their artistic interests, or get depressed, or worse because some twat on the internet called him creepy.  I'm pretty sure he's a sociopath.

I made this post because it's become rather annoying to see people who are just doing something they enjoy -- be it making a music video, trying to sing, learning an instrument, or recording themselves hanging out with their friends -- getting shot down simply because some idiot on the internet decided to take advantage of his internet anonymity to make himself feel better for the day.  You realize how soul crushing that kind of stuff is?

The thing is, within minutes there were floods of negative comments and thumbs down on this kids video. As seen here:

I mean at least 4chan has a ""NOT YOUR PERSONAL ARMY"" thing they do, but you guys just viciously attacked him, he took the video down.. which ruins the fun for everyone else, who woud have otherwise enjoyed cringing at the video.


I'm not saying everyone here is a bully.

I don't know what the solution is, but some of you are bullies, and the reddit community should really intervine. This behavior is juvenile and hurtful.


Like I said I enjoy cringe very much, it feeds a strange hunger I never knew I had when it comes to being entertained. But internet bullies is not something we should be known for.

And I'm strolling through my department like I always am. Greeting customers, offering to help, showing them where that one thing they are looking for is. When I see her. Talking on the phone. Smiling that gorgeous smile. And I think to myself...""where have I seen her before? O.o"" 



I continue my rounds, when she walks up to me with her boyfriend and says ""Hi, we're looking for (thing). Can you show us where we can find it?"" ""Certainly,"" I say. ""Right this way."" After some small talk between the three of us, I hear the boyfriend say ""(Insert nickname here), let's just get this one."" When it clicks. 



It all comes flooding back. It's the girl I had a crush on in 6th grade, back when I was a 4'9"" tall, 160 pound, bumbling...idiot. And, when it does click...I freeze. In my mind, that is. ""Keep it together, man. Just...be yourself. She's with her boyfriend, you'll be fine."" And I keep talking about the thing they're looking at. When, after about five minutes, I finally muster up the courage to say ""I know this is a complete one in a million shot here, but did you by any chance go to (insert school name here) during middle school?"" ""Yes I did,"" she quickly responds, ""why?"" ""Well, I believe we had a class together in 6th grade."" I'll spare you the rest of the details, because... well, it's a damn long conversation. Long story short, it's her, she doesn't remember me, we laugh about how small a world it is, and I keep showing her and her boyfriend what they are looking for. 



After about five or ten minutes, I'm done. I've shown them everything they were looking for, made a few recommendations, and everyone is happy. But I couldn't leave well enough alone. Scumbag brain kicked in, and did something I have never, I repeat NEVER done before. I walk back up to them and say ""One last thing: do you by any chance have a facebook?"" ""Yes, but I'm never on it."" Still could have just walked away. But scumbag brain insisted. ""Well,"" my tongue continued, independently chattering away as my eyes, ears, and brain watched in terror, ""I'm a little hesitant about asking this since your boyfriend is right here, but can I have your number?"" 



Reddit, my brain reached for those words back. Boy, did he reach. But it was too late. I. Had. Fucked. Up. The look in her eyes was enough to kill. But that was nothing compared to the look in her boyfriend's eyes. I...I thought he was going to jump over the cart and tackle me. Hell, I wanted him to. But my brain, in a desperate bid to prevent him from doing so, directed me to look at him and say ""I'm not hitting on your girlfriend or anything, I just wanted to catch up and whatnot."" Good job, dude. All he heard was ""hit on your girlfriend"". I could feel my sphincter tighten from the awkwardness I was drowning in. 

I finally said, ""If you don't want to give it, that's cool. I totally understand."" She fumbled for an excuse, finally settling with ""yeah, I'm not big on giving out my number."" We quickly parted ways soon after. But the fuck up was there. The atrocious mark of my fuckup stained the floor, the aisle...Hell, the entire store. I rushed out of there, and didn't make my rounds for another 2 hours. Reddit...Kill me. Just kill me now.


Edit: forgot to mention that she didn't remember me at all.

These days, I'm 99% sure no one here even knows what the fuck cringe means.

""Cringe"" is something that results when the expected response from someone is far far far off from what the actual response is, due to a lack of empathy from the individual who is said to be ""cringe-worthy"", or when someone catches you doing something you really don't want to be caught doing.

Let's take a look at some good cringe.

[Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f_ec37PXNQ&amp;feature=fvwrel) of a guy trying to wish his girlfriend a happy 7 month anniversary. Why is it ""cringe""? Because the intention was for it to be loving and endearing but it came out incredibly fucking creepy, and the only way he couldn't realize it was incredibly creepy was because he had no idea how anyone else would look at it, showing a marked lack of understanding/social skills on his part.

[Here's another good example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwRgnZ990I). I'm not sure if this guy is mentally disabled or what, but it's clear that he has no clue how people perceive him.

[This is a perfect example of cringe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg5KsKtv-mA) because he's not only creepy, he's also relatively offensive to a lot of people, too. He tried to tell a joke, it clearly bombed, it was sexually suggestive in nature, it happened on TV...all the ingredients are there.

SO NOW WE GOT THE TREND, YA? These people all had an ""intention"" that was horrendously met, and they almost seemed to be unaware of how people would perceive them at the time. That's the cringe!

Now let's talk about some shit that's definitely not cringe and I have no fucking idea why people would even upvote it in the first place.

I remember seeing [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN2VihaR5yg) on the front page a few days ago. Why is it cringe? Because you're 25 years old and you think the power rangers are stupid? If this is cringe-worthy you could honestly just start posting every episode of it to this subreddit to reap that delicious karma.

Here's one right now, our favorite boy, [Justin BEEBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Aw7PfHTr6CM). Why the fuck would I watch a 30 second promo of something geared towards teenage girls and cringe? I know his audience. There is absolutely nothing cringe-worthy about this.

[Here's another [le]gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0ZdVme27yeg#at=126) sitting on the front page. It's a nyan/grumpy cat rap battle. Why the fuck is this cringe? If you hate these memes or whatever, obviously you'll hate it, if you like them, you'll probably like it. Look at the video, it's like 85%+ on the likes. Chances are if you're hating on something with that many likes, you're not the intended audience at all, so why cringe over it?

I was a little on the fence about [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEL93J7sQZ0), but honestly the most ""cringe"" part of this video was the obnoxious fucking text the video editor used. What is the cringe here? He didn't recognize his song immediately because it was being played by ~~an amateur high school~~ a college marching band? His voice doesn't sound the same as when it's auto-tuned? He was relatively in-key by the way, though I can't fucking imagine how hard it would be to sing perfectly in tune when you can barely hear the band playing and you're the only person mic'd with nothing being fed to an earpiece. This isn't good cringe, it barely (if even) qualifies as cringe at all.

How about [the vaseline video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IKxBoPgujNk#at=60)? You mean to tell me that you, an 18-24 aged white male who spends most of his time on the internet, don't find a video of a daytime talk-show directed to middle-aged women exciting..? Come on, stop fucking posting this shit, there's nothing cringe about this.

I don't even know why I made this post, because I doubt the people posting the videos on here who think they're cringy are going to stop. I just hate how completely fucking over-used the word ""cringe"" is these days and I feel like a large part of it is owed to this subreddit, where ""cringe"" went from ""something painfully awkward due to a lack of basic human empathy"" changed to ""OMG LOL THIS IS LIEK SO DUM!!!11""

EDIT:

I'm sorry guys, but I've realized now, that cringe is totally subjective, just like everything in the universe is completely subjective. Here are some really funny epek [le] ""cringe"" videos that go along with a lot of the front page now:

[This guy is sexually harassing this chick and doesn't even realize it ROFL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4)

[OMG this white chick can't dance ROOOOOOFL embarrasses herself when she tries to!!!!!1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0)

[this guy fucks up so many speeches hahaha i feel so awkward for him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE59vpev-xU)

I'll keep it short and sweet, but I really have to get this one off my chest.

I discovered masturbation at a very early age (6). Thanks to this, I thought I could get away with things that, in retrospect, were painfully obvious to everyone around me. I can only hope my parents forgive me for this one:

Cue late-night rated R movie on HBO. I was sitting on an L shaped couch that had a very comfortable corner joint that connected to a shorter couch, myself on the long side, my father on the short side (not to mention my mother no more than 8 feet from me on another couch). Some big tit woman pops up on the screen, and 6 year old me gets an instaboner. I had to take care of this shit. So what do i do? I decide to strip down naked behind a body pillow. And fuck the shit out of it. So there I am, 6 years old, butt fucking naked, raping a stuffed piece of cloth, and it has taken me this long to realize that, not only could my dad obviously see me over a 9 inch high body pillow, but he *didn't* stop me. Which means he knew. He fucking knew. My father watched me fuck a pillow.

Guys. My father watched me fuck a pillow.

(The guy gets revenue from views. So I don't recommend watching if you've already seen it.)

In the [comments, I posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1ax5kh/im_a_gamer/c91nk7p) a [parody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoVhdP_yXnc) made some time ago.

Within the hour, [I was called a ""stupid cunt"",](http://i.imgur.com/mIricRL.jpg) and the video was taken down with a DMCA notice.

After explaining to TheGamersCave that parody falls under fair use, I get [this message](http://i.imgur.com/9HpnxkP.jpg) in response:

(quote)""Would you like to keep arguing, or shall I get my lawyers involved? Parody is not protected under fair use when the arts and assets are claimed to be ones own, and they're not. If you wish to change the art assets used in your video, then there'd be no problem keeping your video live. If you wish to continue, I'll be sure to contact my lawyers and bring this to court.

I'd be willing to settle one one of three things.

1: You keep the video down, and we keep out of the court. I don't have to waste your time, nor mine with a lawsuit and we all live happily.

2: You post the video back, assure to credit me in the description, and I'll claim the video as mine on your channel (Which means my ads will be shown on it)

3: We go to court.""(end quote)

Ironic, considering the guy runs a channel of video game footage.  So of course, those demands were promptly laughed at and ignored.  I doubt the TheGamersCave will find a lawyer desperate enough to even listen to that case.

To this day when I think about it, it sends chills down my spine. I'm such an idiot.

Anyways, I'm at the movie theatre with my friends. As we are walking through the lobby I coincidentally see another friend from school a ways across. I wave and he waves back.

He is pushing a girl in a wheelchair. We start walking towards each other and I think I recognize the girl in the wheelchair as another mutual friend who had recently injured her leg (not seriously, but temporarily wheelchair/crutch worthy) so I loudly, jokingly shout out:

**""Who's the cripple?""**

He stops in his tracks.

I continue to walk towards them and now I can see the horrified look on her face, and it's a face I've never seen before in my life. It is in fact his cousin, who is visiting from out of town, and her legs have been literally crippled since birth. 

I was so distraught I just fumbled around some words. A very awkward 10-20 seconds of meaningless babble, followed by a ""See you later"" and walked into the theatre. I couldn't say ""Sorry I thought you were someone else"" to save my life. I was cooking. Sweating. Easily experiencing one of the top five worse feelings I've ever felt. Could be the worst next to almost drowning (which also happened).

Of course, without thinking, I sit behind the one handicapped spot in the entire theatre. Minutes later, they both come in and she parks directly in front of me. I can hear her very softly sobbing for about two minutes (remember this is when we were kids, maybe 16-17, and she was even younger). He consoles her, gives me a quick look, and then faces forward. I have to sit in shame and stare at her sitting in her chair the entire show.

I never apologized. I couldn't. I was too dissapointed in myself. And my friend who was pushing her? Never spoke a word to me again.

If I was as strong of a person then as I am now, I could have totally made it right, on the spot.

If only time machines were real....

Maybe you guys won't cringe, but I've been cringing the entire time I've been writing this.

**TL;DR I called an actual cripple a cripple thinking it was not an actual cripple but my only temporarily crippled friend.**




Edit: Wow! I can't believe how popular this post is and how many similar stories people have like mine to share. This entire thread has turned into a giant cringe, it's awesome.

I'm getting asked a lot of the same questions so I want to clear a couple things up.

First, this guy I saw with his cousin was not a best friend of mine. More like a high school acquaintance, someone I talked to here and there during school. I think we sat close to each other in homeroom. That being said, I'll probably never contact the guy or his cousin. Yes, I really wish I had had the balls to do the right thing in that moment when I acted like a fool. In the past I've tried looking him up on facebook to no avail, I'm not going to dig any further. It's a small world so if our paths ever cross again, I'll definitely bring it up.

Second, yeah it sucks to think about, but one commenter hit it on the head- there's a good chance it changed me for the better. I sure as hell learned a lesson that day, which is think about shit before you belt it out like a moron. Some people are reacting like this story has ruined my life. Far from it; I love telling this story because people love to hear it, and I love laughing at myself.

And no, I don't remember what movie it was. I was too busy untying my insides to even pay attention.",,False,self,t5_2r6rj,1373385479.0,,,True,t3_1hwfi4,http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1hwfi4/ive_been_living_with_this_moment_of_cringe_my/,

It's usually a guilt free cringe. So, here's what I've got for you guys.

7 years ago I was on a reality television show. That should be cringe worthy enough... but I was also 14. The show was ""Kid Nation"" So, I had the dubious honor of having an awkward phase captured for all posterity and broadcast on CBS. So now, if you google my name, you are greeted with a plethora of videos like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjWXOg859mY), and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp63bVZpihk), and (dear god) [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=-8cQ9ZLYUMs).

These videos are cringe worthy in their own right. Now, imagine being the subject, and having your 5'3'', 80 pound, 14 year old frame captured on 13 hours of digitally preserved video.

For those interested, [the entire show is on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=Og2p65Trlsk).

EDIT: Clearly I fucked up the title. Should have been ""I was *on* 13 episodes...""

EDIT: typos. Also, in case anyone is doubtful of the authenticity, I've got the old ""gold star""  from the show laying around and could post am imgur link when I get back home.

EDIT: [Here's the aforementioned gold star photo](http://i.imgur.com/nC0980J.jpg)

I completely agree, this sub was once great, but it is quickly turning into /r/funny, /r/rage, and /r/wtf

In the most recent post about the decline of this sub, there were arguments in the comments about **what** exactly cringe is. Since it's subjective, there is not necessarily one correct definition.

**So:** Let's try and come up with a sort of guide/definition of what cringe is. Upvote the comments that you think define it well, downvote those that don't. Maybe then we can see what the majority believes to be cringe worthy and go from there. This is my favorite sub, so I hate to see it decline like this.

I'll start:

A cringe video is something that makes me feel extremely awkward and physically embarrassed. Sometimes to the point of not even being able to finish the video. It should be extremely uncomfortable to sit through, and you should **feel** the cringe. If it's just a little bit awkward, or a video with slightly bad editing... that's just a crappy video. It's not cringe. A cringe video should be like eating really spicy food. It fucking hurts, but you kind of like it.

The video should **not** make you angry or just grossed out. 

Examples of what is **not** cringeworthy:



* example: [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/14hug0/big_brother_host_keeps_interrupting_and_doesnt_et/) Yeah, it's somewhat awkward, but it mostly just makes you angry.

Also, [this](http://vimeo.com/3425724) isn't awkward or embarrassing at all. It's just rage inducing. 

And [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDZpq-R82kU) video isn't cringe, it's just hilarious. 

We already have a list of good submissions, so I think it might be helpful to explain what cringe *isn't*.

Okay, so about 4 years ago I think I was 14 at the time and my cousin who I was fairly close with came over with her boyfriend and our grandma to watch a football game at our house. Were all in the living room and im sitting in a recliner with my laptop, now the recliner is kind of in a corner where no one could see what was on the screen. The game was getting boring and as the horny 14 year old boy I was, I pulled up some of that sweet nasty oiled up internet porn, now I had this really cheap pair of headphones that practically amplified the sound of what ever was playing out to everyone else in the room(I did not know this at the time because I was the only one that ever used them) so as the video went on the moans started to get louder and I guess they paused or muted the TV so the whole room was silent except for a tiny Asian lady screaming to give it to her harder(the porn). I see my cousin,her boyfriend and my 89 year old grandmother leave the room and my dad comes over to me and I quickly tab out and he asks me not to do that when people are over.

These are not just awkward or mildly embarrassing. These are things that you struggle to watch all the way through. They are literally is painful to watch. Things you get extreme secondhand embarrassment from. And you just want to look away or have it end.

Now granted, I'm just one person and what I find cringeworthy might be different from what someone else does. And so to some degree the subreddit as a whole can weed out the bad material through upvotes and downvotes. But unfortunately, I see some stuff reaching the front of the subreddit that isn't really even in the same class as ""cringe"" merely because people find it funny or think some guy who in a photo is a loser. And so I think at some level this subreddit has derailed and become r/picturesandvideosoflosers. 

Just my two cents. 

EDIT: A few people seem to infer that I think I'm the decider of what is cringeworthy and what is not. Again, that is not my point. Let me make a comparison. Someone might post a Madonna music video to r/music. I don't like Madonna, so I don't upvote it, but it is music and belongs in the subreddit. Someone else posts a picture of a cute puppy in r/music. And despite the fact that a picture of a puppy has absolutely nothing to do with the subreddit, people upvote it because they find the puppy cute. 

That's sort of what I think r/cringe is becoming. Just because I don't personally cringe from something does not mean it does not belong here; I fully agree with that sentiment. But by the same token, just because something is posted here that people like does not mean it belongs in this subreddit. I'm asking that we get rid of the puppy pictures in our r/music subreddit, so to speak.

(Please upvote for visibility.),drumcowski,882,130,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1084fg/read_me_please_upvote_for_visibility/,"I've responded to dozens of comments and moderator mail in the past 36 hours regarding concerns about the recent surge of new subscribers and the enormous amount of reposts and submissions that don't fit this subreddit. 

My plan, as I've stated many times, was to allow the dust to settle from yesterday's wave of subs before adding or changing any rules. Well, the dust hasn't settled yet. SO, I'm doing it now.

First of all, I'm really glad we have so many new subscribers. More people = more content. Hooray.

Now, there *is* currently a pretty big problem with reposts - which is expected when you double in size in one day. To combat this, I've added a section to the sidebar that will deal with this directly. If you haven't read the sidebar yet, do that now. Right now. It's in this direction ==&gt;

&gt; To help cut down on reposts, the moderators will remove any submission that has a duplicate found within the last 200 posts. If you find a submission that violates this rule, flag it as spam or message the moderators and we'll remove it.
If you're new to this subreddit, please browse through the past 200 posts to familiarize yourself with the content that has already been posted.

Fair enough? Some people might say that's not extreme enough, but we'll just test this out for a bit and go from there. I'm going to go remove some obvious submissions that break this rule after posting this, I won't get them all, but it'll knock out some of the main culprits and that's good enough for me.

**ALSO**, I feel like I need to remind some of you of this part of the sidebar: 

&gt; **Please downvote submissions that clearly don't belong in this subreddit, whether you enjoyed the video or not.**

I'd rather not have to make a post that points out which submissions are good and which are bad, but I'm confident this sub will balance out within a week and we'll be back to business as usual. Until then, **downvote.** Then **downvote some more.**

Cool. Good talk. 

*Questions, comments, concerns? Comment below.*

**Edit:** Added this to the sidebar: 
&gt; Before submitting, ask yourself: ""Does this video belong on /r/WTF?"" and ""Has this been on Tosh.0?"" If the answer to either of those questions is yes, chances are you shouldn't submit it here.

**Edit 2:** So you guys have some perspective, [here's some traffic stats for those interested.](http://www.picamatic.com/show/2012/09/21/08/01/8686645_398x773.jpg)",,False,self,t5_2r6rj,1348243611.0,,,True,t3_1084fg,http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1084fg/read_me_please_upvote_for_visibility/,moderator

I was in the Navy, still in school.  We called it ""C"" school, it was basicly the school that would teach me the job that I would be doing for the rest of my time I served.  My class was relatively small, only about 9 of us in the class.  I was known as the jokester.  I got pretty good at making jokes that others couldn't, or wouldn't get away with telling.  These often included, racist / sexist / insulting jokes.  We were a racily diverse class, and none of my jokes ever really offended anyone, and if they did I always apologized, and avoided making those same kind of jokes around that person.  I never set out to upset anyone.

We had an instructor that frequently came into our classroom to shoot the shit between class times.  We will call him Mr. P for this story.  Mr. P was always the kind to make jokes right along side me.  Always pushing the line of what was acceptable, and was the major reason I felt so at ease making those kinds of jokes in the classroom.

A bit of background before I really begin this story.  Mr. P was a E-5 at the time.  And he had been taking the test to become an E-6 for quite awhile with no luck in passing.  And after awhile of being rejected, eventually, you start to feel a little pissed about not being selected for advancement.  I was, as were many others in my class, an E-3 and were up for the E-4 test soon.

So, on the day in question, Mr. P had just found out that he had not been selected again.  And was doing a damn good job of not letting it show.  He came into our classroom and began talking to us about the upcoming test for E-4.  He was giving us helpful tips and useful suggestions on how to study, on test taking strategies, and other rather good information.  And seeing an opportunity, I raised my hand, waited to be called on, and asked, ""Mr P, do you mind if I ask a horrible question?"".  ""Sure SW82.""

""Why should we take advice on how to pass our exam if you can't pass yours?""

Stunned silence and absolute hate stared back at me.  He dropped his head, looking at the floor and walked out of the room.  My class mates were equally stunned.  And just as equally hated me right then.  I had crossed the line and I knew it.

I was reamed harder that day than my entire time in the Navy.  I was screamed at by every teacher and staff at that command for the better part of an hour.  It was easily the worst day of the past decade for me.  And I cringe so hard each time I think about it.  Why the hell did I ever think that would be a good idea?  I am sure that I will receive some flak for this.  And absolutely every bit of it is deserved.

To Mr. P, I am sorry.

**TL/DR: I insulted my teacher in a completely unacceptable way.  Embarrassing myself, the teacher, and the entire class.**",,False,self,t5_2r6rj,1367984396.0,,,True,t3_1dwpmz,http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1dwpmz/the_single_most_cringeworthy_moment_of_my_life/,

This is a probably 14 year old teenager and other 14 year olds (from this subreddit) are bullying the FUCK out of him on his channel because of a halfway cringe video. It's a kid. He's being silly. Let's not allow people to RUIN this kid.

So I propose a new and harsh rule. As much as I love this subreddit I suggest we make it NO LONGER ALLOWED to link to an original channel if it meets any of these criteria:

1. The person is young, stupid, and most likely going to regret it.
2. The person is disabled or challenged in any way (The schizo you guys obsessed over and spammed)
3. Maybe we shouldn't be allowed to link to original channels at all

I know it would devastate the amount of content that comes into this sub...but so what? Before it got popular it was still great...and yeah it flowed pretty slow. But at least I didn't feel like an asshole for upvoting. So, because people AREN'T going to stop bullying as the rules state, I think we need to, as a community, take drastic measures, and nip this thing in the bud...because we can't control 12 year olds with youtube accounts. I'm NOT going to be the medium for kids to bully other kids over the internet, and I don't care if it changes my experience of Reddit. I'm only flipping shit because some of you are really hurting this kids feelings....and he doesn't deserve it. I'm really fuckin tired of this sub ruining peoples lives. It's against Reddit's rules to post personal information and that's essentially what's happening when we link directly to these kids videos, except it's explicitly FOR making fun of them.",Meta,False,self,t5_2r6rj,1358227706.0,,,True,t3_16l7af,http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/16l7af/okmore_drama_but_really_we_need_to_do_something/,

Alright, so we're subreddit of the day. [No big deal.](http://i.imgur.com/LsIPR.gif) That means there are going to be a bunch of new people who probably aren't going to read the sidebar. That means, reposts. We mods will do what we can, but we won't be able to catch everything. Let's just chill on the ""Welp, goodbye /r/cringe"" posts. We got plenty last time, and we're still doing fine after that whole debacle. We'll be doing fine after this one. 

To new people: Please, please read the sidebar. Then, go through the first few hundred posts before you make a submission. THEN, read the giant red text on the top of the submission page. It goes something like this: ""**SUBMISSIONS WITHOUT A DESCRIPTIVE TITLE WILL BE REMOVED.**"" That's important. If we can't get a general idea of what happens in your video by reading the title, it's not descriptive enough, and we'll remove it. 

That's all for now. I'm sure I'll be editing this post throughout the day so check back if you want. Oh, and I'm sure you've forgotten this by now so I'll repeat it: **read the sidebar.**

Okay. Good talk. Hit the showers.

Today, I was working with a group of eight adult students (early 20s). One of them is a bit of a clown so I thought it would be safe to joke around with him. When he entered the class this morning I was eating a cookie. I looked at him sternly and said, ""I know what you want Charles, but I'm not giving it to you. This is *my* cookie."" I said it with a total straight face.

He looks at me in shock and I start to realize that he's not picking up on the fact that I'm joking, so I try to lay it on a bit thicker. Instead of smiling and repeating myself in a more joke-y way (which I should have done), I decide to get even angrier/more serious so he'll think that I must be joking. So with an even sterner face and almost shouting, I say: ""Charles, stop looking at my cookie! This is my cookie and you can't eat it!""

At this point, the whole class is silent and just staring at me in disbelief. Charles looks like he's about to cry.
