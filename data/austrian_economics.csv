1353338699.0,70,self.austrian_economics,13gbg0,90% of economic fallacies come from a misunderstanding of Say's Law,MELBOT87,78,8,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/13gbg0/90_of_economic_fallacies_come_from_a/,"I often argue in r/economics. I have come to the conclusion that a vast majority of economic fallacies (if not all) comes from the misunderstanding and misapplication of Say's Law. I think this article does a good job of explaining it: [Understanding Say's Law of Markets](http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/understanding-says-law-of-markets/).

Demand is the desire + ability to pay for goods and services. Production must necessarily come first because it is through production of a good or through labor (which is compensated with wages) that a person can have demand. He can then use that demand to exchange with other goods and services.

The two lines of argument that you will encounter. (1) Demand must come first because businessmen want demand before they produce a product. (2) Not all supply creates demand.

(1) This confuses existing demand and the creation of demand. Businessmen produce because they want to capture existing demand, i.e. they produce a product and want others who have already produced and thus have demand to buy theirs. Creation of demand still comes from supply. The consumers buying a businessman's product must have already produced in order to then consume.

(2) This argument confuses the contrapositive. Saying that supply creates demand does not mean that everything created creates demand. If a businessman creates a product nobody wants, then it will not increase demand. But it doesn't change the argument that in order for there to be demand, production must come first.

Excerpt from his bio:
&gt;His interest in economics and philosophy began in earnest during the financial crisis of 2008, where an interest in trying understand what was going on lead him to discover Austrian economics and classical liberal philosophy by way of Russ Robert’s “EconTalk” podcast as well as many other sources. He has spent the past several years teaching himself macroeconomics and the history of economic thought, having taken exactly one formal economics class in high school. Yes, John reads textbooks for fun. Yes, he knows that it’s weird.
&gt;
&gt;This interest and concern for the state of economic understanding lead John to team up with Russ to create EconStories, a groundbreaking new media brand dedicated to re-imagining economics education through creativity and storytelling. John co-wrote, produced and directed two hip-hop music videos about the economy, “Fear the Boom and Bust”,  and “Fight of the Century”, which have become global sensations, garnering mainstream international press and over 4 million combined views on YouTube. Both videos are being used in classrooms all over the world as well as winning the prestigious Templeton Award for innovative media.

I personally don't post there because I don't think it's a good target audience (mostly economics students with a vested interest in the mainstream/status quo?). But maybe we can provide an alternative viewpoint for interested readers, and that's why it's good to mix in.

I don't have a lot of time to spend on it, but at the very least I can provide some mediation in the case of deleted submissions and other problems.

&gt;In particular, we're looking for a mod who is sympathetic to the Austrian school of economics, in an effort to disabuse one of our readers of the notion that we've been ""suppressing"" Austrian submissions.

My reply:

**What would be your best response to these questions and statements:**

1. Is government the antithesis of liberty?

2. One of the things that enhances freedoms are roads. Infrastructure enhances freedom. A social safety net enhances freedom.

3. What should we do with the losers that are picked by the free market?

4. Do we live in a society or don't we? Are we a collective? Everybody's success is predicated on the hard work of all of us; nobody gets there on their own. Why should it be that the people who lose are hung out to dry? For a group that doesn't believe in evolution, it's awfully Darwinian.

5. In a representative democracy, we are the government. We have work to do, and we have a business to run, and we have children to raise.. We elect you as our representatives to look after our interests within a democratic system.

6. Is government inherently evil?

7. Sometimes to protect the greater liberty you have to do things like form an army, or gather a group together to build a wall or levy.

8. As soon as you've built an army, you've now said government isn't always inherently evil because we need it to help us sometimes, so now.. it's that old joke: Would you sleep with me for a million dollars? How about a dollar? -Who do you think I am?- We already decided who you are, now we're just negotiating.

9. You say: government which governs least governments best. But that were the Articles of Confederation. We tried that for 8 years, it didn't work, and went to the Constitution.

10. You give money to the IRS because you think they're gonna hire a bunch of people, that if your house catches on fire, will come there with water.

11. Why is it that libertarians trust a corporation, in certain matters, more than they trust representatives that are accountable to voters? The idea that I would give up my liberty to an insurance company, as opposed to my representative, seems insane.

12. Why is it that *with* competition, we have such difficulty with our health care system? ..and there *are* choices within the educational system.

13. Would you go back to 1890?

14. If we didn't have government, we'd all be in hovercrafts, and nobody would have cancer, and broccoli would be ice-cream?

15. Unregulated markets have been tried. The 80’s and the 90’s were the robber baron age. These regulations didn't come out of an interest in restricting liberty. What they did is came out of an interest in helping those that had been victimized by a system that they couldn't fight back against.

16. Why do you think workers that worked in the mines unionized?

17. Without the government there are no labor unions, because they would be smashed by Pinkerton agencies or people hired, or even sometimes the government.

18. Would the free market have desegregated restaurants in the South, or would the free market have done away with miscegenation, if it had been allowed to? Would Marten Luther King have been less effective than the free market? Those laws sprung up out of a majority sense of, in that time, that blacks should not.. The free market there would not have supported integrated lunch counters.

19. Government is necessary but must be held accountable for its decisions.",,False,self,t5_2stjd,1345604641.0,,,True,t3_ltrg1,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/ltrg1/jon_stewarts_19_questions_to_libertarians/,

The internet is a vast ""highway"" of sorts, available to the public, and sustained by entrepreneurs, volunteers, and users with money to spend. Even those without money can go hop on a computer at the library (I know, I know, state run...), though they may have to wait in line, or use lesser equipment.

I see the internet as the current crowning jewel of free enterprise, and could probably draw a lot of similar analogies in these types of debates.

1345833334.0,49,self.austrian_economics,yrmje,Things we need to stop doing: Citing ShadowStats,Aneirin,62,13,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/yrmje/things_we_need_to_stop_doing_citing_shadowstats/,"Frequently, I've seen people on this subreddit (and some others calling themselves Austrians) cite [ShadowStats.com](http://www.shadowstats.com/) (also known as ""Shadow Government Statistics""), most often while claiming that inflation rates are substantially higher than governmental estimates (usually around 6-10% instead of 0-2% for CPI-U) due to methodology changes made in the calculation of inflation rates. (See their estimates [here](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts).) **This is wrong, and we need to stop doing it for the sake of our credibility.**

* First, basic introspection should tell us that an inflation rate of 6-10% over the past 20-30 years simply does not reflect reality. A ~8% inflation rate (based on their claims about what inflation would be if it were calculated in the same way as it were in 1980) over the past 10 years, for instance, would mean that the price level would have more than doubled during that time period. Does that sound remotely accurate?

I think perhaps an even more illustrative example is this: [If you use ShadowStats numbers supposedly representing 1980s methodologies, the real value of a house has fallen pretty much consistently since 1980](http://blog.jparsons.net/2011/03/shadow-stats-debunked-part-i.html). So was there simply not a housing bubble?

Furthermore, it's not just the Bureau of Labor Statistics who have contradicted ShadowStats; [MIT and Google have as well](http://blog.jparsons.net/2011/06/shadow-stats-debunked-part-ii.html).

* ShadowStats (and its owner, John Williams) are also incorrect about the methodologies they criticize. [Here's a detailed post on EconBrowser on how ShadowStats' claims regarding good-substitution in newer models of CPI are wrong](http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/09/shadowstats_deb.html), for instance.

Also, the [BLS publishes CPI-RS](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpirsdc.htm), which is basically an inflation calculation using raw data from 1978 to now under the new methodologies. It is true that the CPI-RS rates are lower for the period than the data with older methodologies, but not by that much (it's a difference of 0.45 percentage points; see [page 30 of this](http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1999/06/art4full.pdf)).

* Their objections to the new methodologies don't even theoretically make sense. They claim that the ""basket"" of goods used to calculate CPI should stay constant over time (see the Econbrowser post I cited above, where they are cited claiming that a fixed basket of goods should be used, without any reweighting of goods). This is clearly incorrect; if consumers shift their purchases towards new sets of goods whose prices are changing at different rates than the older sets, measured inflation should absolutely try to adjust the weightings of goods to accommodate these differences. In an extreme case, if an item becomes obsolete, a ""fixed-basket"" approach would still try to include it somehow. This clearly is incorrect.

* Their own statistics are not what they say they are. For instance, [as this Reddit post observes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/omfrm/3_reasons_people_need_to_stop_citing_shadowstats/), before 1983, the housing portion of CPI was based on actual house prices, but was then changed to owner equivalent rent (the rent which would be expected to be charged for a given house). The SGS Alternate Inflation index, reflecting this difference, should have a widening gap with the CPI during the housing bubble (as price-to-rent ratios expanded), and a narrowing gap with the CPI after the bubble burst. However, if you look at the SGS estimates I linked to above, these changes do not appear.

What they seem to actually be doing is just adding a constant percentage to the CPI. This is obviously wrong, because a change in methodology would change measured inflation, but not just by some fixed amount. 

In short, ShadowStats is (pretty much) outright lying about their statistics, and is generally a bad source. Please don't cite them, and if you see anyone else citing them, point out their error.

When we talk about the history of the Austrian school or use “Austrian belief” as a shorthand, time and energy restraints sometimes make this the most realistic approach to take. However, it is important to keep in mind that there are many things on which both historical Austrians as well as modern day Austrians have differences of opinion. [Hulsmann has a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV0OcvylweM) that goes over some of the older departures. 

A list of some differences:

[Theory of Entrepreneurship](http://bastiat.mises.org/2012/05/klein-versus-kirzner/), [Klein, Foss](http://web.missouri.edu/~kleinp/papers/05-076179-Foss.pdf) and [Kirznerian](http://www.gmu.edu/depts/rae/archives/VOL14_1_2001/3_yu.pdf)

Interest Theory: [Pure Time Preference Theory](https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/guidechap6.asp) and its many detractors [Lewin](http://www.utdallas.edu/~plewin/ptpt.pdf), [Murphy](http://mises.org/journals/scholar/murphy2.pdf), 
[Hulsmann](http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae5_4_7.pdf)
This debate goes back to Menger and Bohm-Bawerk as far as I can tell. 

[Uncertainty](http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE10_1_3.pdf), [the importance of expectations](http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/b2lachmann.htm) and [kaledics](http://mises.org/books/capital_expectations_lachmann.pdf).

Free bankers like [Horowitz](http://www.freebanking.org/2011/06/27/the-problem-is-central-banking-not-fractional-reserve-banking/) and [Selgin](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7114B4956D974D8D) and full reserve banking and full-reserve, commodity backed banking [Hulsmann](http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE9_1_1.pdf) and [Rothbard](http://mises.org/daily/1829)

Even whether the ABCT is best visually represented and understood as a [Hayekian triangle](http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Hayekian_triangle) or a trapezoid [Hulsmann](http://ead.univ-angers.fr/~granem08/IMG/pdf/DT-GRANEM-09-34.pdf), [Block].

This is a cursory list of some of maybe the best known debates (we can consider BTC vs. anti-BTC very much an extension of the free banking question). I know there are also different interpretations of the exact source of rent, what make useful pedagogical tools, whether equilibrium or disequilibrium have a stronger pull in the economy, etc. 

Anywho, a person needn't know all of the nuances of the different theorists (I certainly don't), but just be aware that the school isn't a monolith.

I feel that Keynesians are often misunderstood by Austrians (I should note that I am by no means a Keynesian). They believe in the market economy, low taxes, and that increases in the total stock of production are what really matter for wealth(labor, capital, and technology). They believe in subjective value and the price system and competition for the most efficient allocation of resources. Sometimes I feel they are portrayed as anti market socialists, when that really is not the case.

1376424753.0,42,self.austrian_economics,1kau85,"Zerohedge posts article claiming GDP growth was faster without a central bank. Comments section claims growth was driven by abundant resources, so I checked to see if real commodity prices were actually much lower in the past.",davidchester,46,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/1kau85/zerohedge_posts_article_claiming_gdp_growth_was/,"The main objection in the comments that I saw was that ""the late 1800's growth was driven by a resource boom, and now resources are harder to come by.""  I set out to see if this was true or not, since nobody backed up the statement with any sort of data. 

While it is true that there were far more mining and resource extraction jobs for americans during this period, I wondered if resources themselves were any more plentiful on the market.  To determine this, I looked into the real prices of various commodities.  Two links were the most helpful:
Go to page 30 of:

http://www.sfu.ca/~djacks/papers/workingpapers/w18874%20(typology).pdf

And:

http://chartsbin.com/view/oau

The objection mentioned above really only holds true for crude oil, petroleum, and beef, primarily after 1970, and for other commodities after 2000. Remember, real GDP grew faster during the late 1800's than it did during the post war boom between 1946 and 1970.  

If you examine the second link, crude oil was about as cheap as it was during the late 1800's for most of the 1900's, while real refined petroleum prices did creep up throughout the 1900's (from the 1st link, under ""energy prices"").

Just about every other commodity became cheaper during the 1900's in real terms than it had been during the late 1800's, or at least remained stable during the period.

Also, oil may have been far cheaper during the late 1800's oil boom, but it wasn't being used that extensively throughout the economy, and probably only contributed slightly to growth overall.  People weren't driving cars during this time, after all.

By far, the most important resource during the 1800's was coal, and coal continued to be the most important energy resource throughout the 1900's.  

Let's look at real coal prices:


http://econbus.mines.edu/working-papers/wp201210.pdf

If you look at page 3, you can clearly see that coal was not drastically cheaper during the 1800's and the real price of coal during the post war boom was about as low as the real price during the late 1800's low point.  

Now, let's examine growth during the late 1800's and the post war boom, when commodities were equally cheap in real terms (approximately):

From measuringworth.com:


US	

1875 to 1900	

1946 to 1970

Real GDP	4.50%	3.68%

(The 4.5% corresponds to the period 1875-1900)


US	

1876 to 1900	

1946 to 1970

Real GDP per capita	2.39%	2.09%

So here we have a comparison between two periods, the latter involving central banking, fiat money, and a safety net combined with high taxation, and the former involving none of those things. Both of these periods experienced similar real commodity prices, with many commodities actually being cheaper during the latter period.  

Now, I can agree that this is not proof that we would be much better off without a central bank or social safety net.  However, it does explode the idea that the economy CANNOT function well without a central bank.  It clearly can, and has.  The data that I've linked to explodes the myth that the 1800's benefited from unusually cheap resources, which certainly isn't the case in real terms.  

Some people put forth the argument that land was cheaper and virtually free during this period, and that that explains the higher growth rate as well.  

I don't even need to post links to debunk this one, since even today, you can go out and find land that costs practically nothing if you really want to.  And believe me, any useful land that was in close proximity to major cities was quite expensive in the past as well. There's plenty of cheap and nearly free land throughout the US that you could easily homestead right now.  

I could even discuss all of the things that the 20th century has that the 1800s did not. Plastic jumps immediately to mind. Plastic is the cheapest, lightest, most easily manipulated substance in the history of mankind, even at record high oil prices. Then there's the fact that the US printed THE world reserve currency during the post war era. 1800s USA didn't have a fraction of the global military power or financial influence that it has in the modern era.

I am also a Communist, as you know, probably the very opposite of all of you. We probably have a lot of differences in economical philosophy, and that's what I'd love to discuss.

I've recently created a subreddit in order to attempt to foster discussion between Capitalists and Communists. As people advocating for non-interventionist Capitalism, you fall on the other side of the spectrum that we Communists are on.

I'd love to discuss more on our differences, and possibly learn from one another as well. I'm sure there are many things you could bring into the discussion, and I'd love to hear your side of the story.

After all, if /r/debateacommunist only had Communists, it would be a circlejerk, not a debate. Nobody wants that.

Keynes believed the same thing. He said that during a recession, people lose money and jobs (by definition), and that if a person is losing money, or fearing his job, he will cut back his budget. Since one man's spending is another man's income, another person will lose income as a result of this.

Today, non-Austrian thinkers far outnumber Austrian thinkers. Attempting to change that means we want to make a lot of friends; new friends. If you want to make new friends it's important to come off friendly. If you want to make other people reasonable, it's important to be reasonable yourself first. If you want to give off a sense that you have confidence in your ideas, then it's important to rely on your ideas. If you want to convince other people, then it's important to give other people as much chance as possible to come to your side, which means to give other people as little reason as possible to get upset with you.

---

To give an illustration of where I think improvement on this is possible, I will point out a number of titles Tom Woods has given to his videos and blog posts:

&gt;Yglesias Doesn't Understand Ron Paul (or Economics) (video)

Woods says another person has no understanding of economics. That's not a very respectable way of approaching another person.

&gt;Is Paul Krugman a Coward? (video)

Also not respectful, and childish.

&gt;Mark Levin, Ron Paul Hater, Put in His Place (video)

If you denote someone categorically as a 'hater', then you give them no possibility to side with you. To 'put in his place' means 'X is not as important as he thinks', which is not focussing on the ideas and instead is picking a fight.

&gt;Ezra Klein Calls for Another Housing Bubble, Is Taken Down by Murphy (blog)

Now the metaphors get more violent: 'taken down' creates an image of tackling somebody (or worse). That's not how you create friends.

&gt;American Spectator Dead Wrong on Ron Paul (video)

Unnecessary and morbid adjective. If you push this hard on how wrong you think other people are, then this is making them that much harder to reconsider their position.

&gt;Anti-Gold Propagandist Steps into the Shredder (blog)

Gruesome and inappropriate.

---

One argument would be that these sorts of actions (not just in titles, but in general) gain attention. It may gain attention but moreso by people interested in drama than people interested in ideas. Economics and its application is abstract and difficult. This means it requires concentration and consideration. If you create drama, you set off people's fight or flight emotional response instead of their prefrontal cortex logical reasoning, which they require if you're asking them to reconsider a lifetime of other ideas.

What I have read and seen of conventional economic analysis has seemed to me to be wildly unsatisfactory, viewed alongside physical analysis.

Knowing that the two studies are profoundly different, but interested to know what a satisfactory system might look like, I set out to outline the fundamentals of a potentially acceptable system for describing and later for analyzing economic activity.

I have arrived at the point where I have come into contact with the Austrian school and see some striking similarities but have come up with a potential deviation that need investigating.

Here it is:
In my view, the elementary particle in the economic universe is the human to human exchange. The economic universe can be divided into infrastructure, resources and humans, but only the human part can exert willful influence on the behavior of the system; there are no market forces outside of those provided by human minds.

One of the human participating in a potential exchange will evaluate the personal result of a change and accept the trade if the result is acceptable.

That evaluation will take one of two forms, depending on whether the human is operating in a confident or fearful environment (I haven't quantified any of this yet).  The evaluation will be expressed in terms of *fear* if he is fearful and *desire* if he is confident, but the structure is the same.

The outcome of an exchange can be thought of either as desire that the trade be made, or fear that the trade will not be made.  The two are equivalent as far as I can see.  In a fearful environment, the evaluation is made in terms of fear. Looking at his belief of his future state after the trade, if he is proposing a trade he will be fearful that the trade might not be made and his evaluation will be the amount of fear he feels for the outcome where he does not get the offering of the other. He balances this against the fear he feels for the potential outcome in which he gets the offering of the other but loses the offering he is putting up, the fear he feels for his future without that which he is offering up.  He is, in effect, balancing what he might not gain against what he might lose. He is estimating how much his fear will be reduced by each alternative and will select the one that reduces his fear the most.

Here's my problem. In a synopsis of von Mises' **Human Action**, the statement was made in the context of just this kind of transaction  *The opposite to action is not inaction. Rather, the opposite to action is contentment.*

It seems to me that in a primarily fearful environment, there is no guarantee that refusal to make a trade ( I have taken this to mean *inaction*) is based on contentment, it might just be an overpowering fear.

Is any guidance available for resolving this issue?

The LvMI has decided to shut down its forums. I have no idea why, but that was their decision to make. We would like to maintain the high level of discussion that went on there and have it migrate. That is why I decided to offer LibertyHQ forums as the place to migrate.

The forums were just created and are expected to grow rather quickly. :)

The benefits of these forums include

- Very limited moderation

- Mises.org forum members are pretty smart -and you guys, too!

- Umbrella community for right-libertarians

- Upcoming integration with the LibertyHQ website for easy access to literature and materials

Reddit is pretty great and allows for an ever-fresh stream of discussion. As such, I'm not asking you to abandon this place. I'm asking you to also consider these forums which allow for more solid, long-term discussion.

Yes, I realize that forums suffer due to network effects - the value of the forum increases with more users. But let's use voluntary action to overcome this. Post anything related to libertarianism there that you find of interest. We're trying to get numbers up.

IMPORTANT: If you're Austrian or inclined, make sure you message me after you sign up. I'm trying out a forum model where the forums are layered so that we can separate out AnCap discussion from other libertarian discussion. Posts that pertain to libertarianism in general are encouraged to go in the public forum, while if we're debating AnCap-specific stuff I would like to try out (for the time being) having it separated into another forum (we can, of course, drop hints here and there). So **MESSAGE ME so I can give you AnCap access!**",,False,self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,t3_14ymsu,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/14ymsu/misesorg_forum_to_close_soon_please_sign_up_for/,

He's an excellent instructor because he tries to get his students to intuitively grasp what they're doing in their formulaic manipulations in those subjects, as opposed to most teachers in the establishment who just want to get through their day and go home after reciting from the textbook what looks like to the students arcane gibberish.

Some in here may have already seen his first poor attempt in a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ami32DSMpJM) he uploaded and took down after only a half hour.  Like others, I'm encouraged by this act as I think it shows he wants to get it right.  He could be like all the other Austrian critics and strawman the theory and move on like they refuted it, or pretend the theory doesn't even exist.

I and I bet some of you will be watching his channel in the next couple weeks to see what he comes up with.  Imagine if he read Human Action, Theory and History, etc. and was actually converted; imagine how powerful of a conduit he would be.  I confess I don't think the chances are stellar because he was a hedge fund analyst and probably bought into the statistical aggregative computer analysis of stock trading, but we'll see.  He seems like a bright and honest fellow and I imagine a sizable portion of his audience are homeschoolers with a libertarian bent.

I do not know how to counter this. I know that government creates all monopolies and that monopolies do not exist in the free market, but i cant specifically argue against carnegie steel because there is little information online.  

I do not know much about the carnegie steel company and why it was a monopoly, or not. All I know is that Andrew Carnegie made a great product and captured most of the market due to being a stellar business man. And then it got broken up by the government after it was a monopoly. 

I cant seem to find anything on what happened to Carnegie Steel or how I should counter my statist friends. Seeking some help on why carnegie steel either A) happened because of government intervention (which is usually the case), or B) how carnegie steel wasn't that bad and just gets a bad rap but actually helped many things, kinda like how Wal-Mart is today.

Panamanian inflation is usually between 1 and 3 points lower than US inflation; it is caused mostly by the Federal Reserve's effect on world prices (it has taken the USD as a de facto currency). This market-driven system has created an extremely stable macroeconomic environment. Panama is the only country in Latin America that has not experienced a financial collapse or a currency crisis since its independence (in 1903).

...

Deflation happens without the terrible consequences that Keynesian economists predict; and the country, now under democratic rule, is experiencing its 4th year of market economic growth well above 7%. So the policy makers who have said that abolition of the central bank is unfeasible need only look to Panama's macroeconomic environment, which has been favorable for over 100 years, to realize that it is, in fact, not only possible, but very beneficial. Clearly no government-forced fiat currency, no central bank, and the absence of high inflation are working quite well in this small country.

I opted for private loans and was denied. 

I went for the worst possible route and leveraged a means of tuition payment composed of 75% work and 25% credit card usage. I never did the ""full load"" of credits as not to be overwhelmed by crushing debt. When I finished school at the age of 27, I left with around $26k in total debt. 

Today, only 3 years later, I've made my last payment of debt. Through living well below my means, and careful metering of my finances to still have some fun, I have applied the principals of Austrian Economics to my life. By consequence, I am now a debt free person. 

Moving forward, I am becoming a person who saves for the rainy day, to buy a house, to pay for the unexpected, etc. All of which is contrary to what is being advocated by our leadership.

Since the security of bitcoin is higher than conventional banks and the system is deflationary by design - there is no incentive to put savings in a bank. 

This throws a big wrench in the whole scheme whereby high savings equals low interest rates signaling business owners to take out loans for long term projects.

How would these signals be sent in the brave new world of pseudo anonymous peer to peer crypto currencies?

Austrians say that the only way for a currency to avoid hyperinflation is to be pegged to gold or silver or both. This is due to the value of gold\silver being regulated by the markets and not the government.

I get that but what about other resources such as OIL. As a commodies trader oil seems like a better choice because it gains value due to its non-renewability and it's continuously rising demand.

Gold on the other hand doesn't rise in value and if the US went back to a gold standard tomorrow its safe to say that gold will be in excess of $1,000,000 an ounce to account for all the US dollars in existence.

If we tied the dollar to oil and stopped printing US dollars then the US dollar will start to gain value again as oil becomes more and more scarce.

The obvious problem would be when the oil market collapses and that day will likely come within our lifetime however that problem can be solved by using the new value of the us dollar created through the oil peg to buy gold\silver from foreign countries to create a safety net for when oil collapses.",,False,self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,t3_q2nmi,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/q2nmi/can_a_currency_be_backed_by_something_other_then/,

""LA: Do you think our government has learned its lesson about how to manage the money supply?

Also: Why it doesn't matter.",latewire,33,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/w2uti/banks_caught_manipulating_their_own_credit_scores/,"So this is just my take on it, I found out what Libor is today so please correct me if I have it wrong.

Libor, as I understand it, is basically the interest rate / credit score the banks use when they loan to each other. The movement of money between banks facilitates a large portion of the money in the market. A shift here could cause a shift in all subsequent loans.

Recently, [as revealed here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0oV2mI0IYp8#!), banks were caught manipulating these rates in various ways to have the market work to their advantage. [The government has started issuing massive fines to these institutions](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bank-investors-dark-040018306.html) as it's become too difficult to ignore.

Many people are asking why nobody is paying attention and why this wasn't seen sooner... Why isn't the free market reacting? the problem is that it WAS checked and [suspected of being manipulated by several private publications](http://www.fticonsulting.com/global2/media/collateral/united-states/libor-manipulation.pdf) years ago! In a free market, these allegations would be a death sentence to an organization.

However, being as how the government is basically just dumping money on these institutions and telling everyone that they're ""too big to fail"", moral hazard is out of freaking control.

The whole ""revelation"" that these banks are manipulating the market is really not important news, especially when the larger picture of market manipulation and book-cooking by the government and The Fed makes this look like a ""little white lie"". The banks have become slaves / cohorts with the government. Why focus on the one limb of the monster when it wrecks a house while the rest of him is wrecking the entire country? How is this any different from Geithner telling AIG to lie about Sachs benefiting from their bailout?

[This](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bank-investors-dark-040018306.html) Article basically says that the fines that these banks are incurring are even larger than the cash reserves they have on hand (read: endangering the solvency of the bank)... Anyone think that the government would go through the trouble of bailing out these banks only to kill them for being naughty later?

**TL;DR:** Yes, these big banks are cooking their books, but they can do anything they want because the government has demonstrated that no matter how badly they mess up, they will be bailed out. Moreover, this pales in comparison the sanctioned manipulation going on in other areas of finance due to government.

Edit: PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong, I just read 3-4 articles about how we should be outraged and still wasn't any more pissed than I was about the whole government/banking complex in the first place. It actually annoys me a bit that anti-corporate lackeys ignore all the government's horrific crimes and then get appalled when the ""business"" sector does something rather minor in comparison.",,False,self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,t3_w2uti,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/w2uti/banks_caught_manipulating_their_own_credit_scores/,

Article and critique in the comments.",Charming_man,27,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/tiqhe/switzerland_calls_for_a_for_an_unconditional/,"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/05/07/switzerland-an-initiative-to-establish-basic-income-for-all/

The guaranteed income was first proposed in its modern form by Belgian Marxist Philippe van Parijs. The positives include the reduced administration costs of aid programs, as they can be rolled into one. It also does not carry with it the same deleterious consequence of reducing the labor supply for low income jobs as severely as the negative income tax as supported by Friedman. Indeed, Friedrich Heyek himself supported the policy, stating ""Some security [referring to ""security against severe privation and the reduction of the avoidable causes of misdirected effort and consequent disappointment.""] is essential if freedom is to be preserved, because most men are willing to bear the risk which freedom inevitably involves only so long as that risk is not too great."" So did Thomas Paine.

On the other hand, this induces many to leave the work force, as it substantially reduces the opportunity cost of leisure. The effects are magnified due to the declining marginal utility of the dollar. The guaranteed income was tried in Japan in the 1950 and in select US sites in the 1970s. The work disincentives were substantial and hit young people the hardest. Indeed, fraud in the UK welfare system creates a version of this proposal, and it has created a generation of disaffected youth. The program has eaten away at the foundation of their culture, and yielded consequences such as the recent riots. 

I contend that modern welfare systems for able bodied and minded individuals is nothing short of a humanitarian tragedy. It creates an underclass, destroys communities and culture, and increases inequality. Alaska, with oil rebate checks, implements this sort if system in Inuit villages. The alcoholism is finishing what Cortez started, and I do not think my hyperbole is being misused.

Furthermore, is it not immoral to tax for such a purpose? What about the burden on the economy? The picture in the article mentions that people will have more time on their hands after not worrying about pay. The artist fails to consider that the pay is earned in exchange for building up the economy's stock of capital. Capital, which is the wellspring of human prosperity, separating us from the caveman.

Check out The Conquest of Poverty, by Henry Hazlitt for a good read. Hazlitt showed that the only way to get people off welfare is to stop the payments.

Politics is an observational, not an experimental science.""[13] Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behavior in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.
Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in biology or inanimate objects as in physics.

I want a good question to ask him. I'll try and ask the best one I get here.

Update:

Damn, that was awesome. Shook his hand, got my picture with him, and got him to sign Crash Proof and Why an Economy Grows. I stood in line to ask a question, but there was like 40 people in line and he only got to about 15 of them. Both the questions I was going to ask him were asked by other people though (Gold standard, Japan).

Some of his more interesting comments were:

1) He is confident we will return to a gold standard if/when the dollar collapses. He said it is the only standard that works. Someone asked him that isn't there not enough gold in the world to support the monetary system, and Schiff responded of course there is. He said it's not a question of quantity, but of price. Gold at $10,000 could support the global monetary system.

2) Someone asked him about Japan. He made it seem like they were ok and that we have a much bigger problem. Reasons he cited were that Japan finances a good majority of it's debt internally and that they have a fundamentally stronger economy than the US, I assume because they actually make things there.

3) Timing: He said we have about 6 months - 2 years left before the system comes undone. He said specific timing impossible but that we don't have long. Pointed to the last time they tried to pump up a bubble to prevent a deeper recession was in 01/02 with Greenspan's 1% rates. That got us 6 years. This time they lowered to 0% to inflate our way out of this mess, but he said this time there's no way we make it 6 years. We're already about 3 years into helicopter Ben's 0%, so you do the math.

Everything else was just his usual speech, plenty of those videos on youtube.

Primarily, the philosophical framework each theory is operating under are not compatible with each other for the purpose of meaningful debate. It makes less sense than debating ""Fried Chicken"" versus ""Gun Control"".

In short, there is no ""trade off value"" between each theory, and technically the theories are completely compatible with each other (in contrast to creating cognitive dissonance if attempted) when it is considered that:

* Evolution - as a model for the **causal relationship** between the observed variation in species alive, and in fossil record. Of note, investigation into the theory of evolution has determined thus far (to my understanding) that the sustainability of a specific species distinct from other species is an emergent property of the relationship between environment and genetics, and that such changes are demonstrated to be ""punctual"", and not ""gradual"". This more or less explains the great diversity of species with small variations within them, and periodic extinctions, for which there is observable evidence. The acceptance / solidarity of this theory exists without an even remotely conflicting explanation to date. Advances in the theory over the past few decades have generally been adopted as quickly as they have been presented.

versus

* Creation(ism) - as a component of the **teleological relationship** between man and the universe for helping individuals discover their purpose of being. The story of ""Genesis"" explains in part that the origins of your being come from from the will of a great creator. Without going into the specifics (of which I would not be the best person to try and abridge), there has been a long tradition of passing wisdom from generation to generation through story. This wisdom, not easily quantifiable, has proven itself to be communicated well in this form and valuable to people, as much as gold has proven itself to be a good money historically. In attempt to give this message a bit more credit, if one is struggling with the question of the purpose of existence and associated free will, an axiom / foundation of certain faith, as expressed through the story of Genesis, your existence is not accidental.

In my view, the debate of whether either should be taught at all, in a public school, a private school, in which classroom under what name, or by what teacher is ENTIRELY POLITICAL, no matter how either side tries to frame it. Are there real issues to resolve in developing a quality egalitarian curriculum (the necessity of which being a completely different debate)? Sure, but not to some great controversial degree with *this* issue worth berating people over relative to any other subject.

As a ""fan"" of science and the rise in the standard of living it has brought us, I am disappointed in my fellow science fans for seemingly making it appear as though *only* causal knowledge has has any kind of validity; at times it seems *everything* else is dismissed as, ""well, that's just like your opinion, man"", when something can't be proven by the venerated ""scientific method"". I think it is arguably as narrow minded (separate from excusable) as believing the Bible is the only canon of absolute truth.

Want a real issue? Why the hell are Economics classes still explaining US Interventionist policy as ""the unquestionably *reasonable* compromise between the *extremist* proposals of Market versus Command economies""? As if that can be said with any kind of intellectual honesty. When will *that* belief be relegated to the category of ""religion / history""?

I mean if a company has soaring productivity and low costs it doesn't mean that alone it'll be successful it needs a certain amount of consumer spending to vindicate the investments without it the project will perish. Now obviously I disagree with the Fed's policies of easy fast cash to stimulate the economy but at the same time I haven't been able to dismiss the theory that spending does stimulate economic activity and is an essential tool to gage whether the investment you made was a success or not.

I plan on going to school for economics though and the austrian school fascinates me. I wanted to get your take on the FairTax and the Flat Tax. Which one would be better and why?

In my perspective, I love the FairTax because it's simple, and everyone residing in the US would pay taxes, even illegals. This could boost revenues greatly and help with the deficit. However, there are provisions for rebates for poor families so I'm actually not too sure how it would affect illegal immigrants since a lot of them are poor.

The Flat Tax sounds nice though because there are no deductions or anything, it's simply a matter of ""How much did you make this year? Okay, give us 12%."". Although personally I don't believe the government has a right to the fruits of my labor, this would be preferable to our current system.

For the lazy:  
-FairTax eliminates all federal taxes and replaces it with a 23% sales tax on new goods and services. Used goods and services will not be taxed. (www.fairtax.org)  
-Flat Tax, as far as I know, simply brings the income tax down to 12 or so % for everyone. I could be wrong though.

While I agree it has contributed largely to the problems our economy is facing, it also seems to me like a pretty sensible policy when carried out responsibly.

While it would go a long way towards preventing bank runs and limiting the severity of economic downturns, without FRB, banks would not have capital to loan out to entrepreneurs, limiting economic activity. In this world, traditional banks would cease to be a source of funding for entrepreneurial endeavors, leaving this function entirely to the equity markets, private capital firms, and hedge funds. This would undeniably raise interest rates considerably and make innovation much harder to come by. 

These are just my initial thoughts on the matter. Could someone help explain to me why the trade-off of greater stability is worth the restriction of entrepreneurial funding?

&gt; Years ago, when developing their infrastructure, the Soviets decided that hot water would be distributed to everyone from a central source; no one would have their own water heater in their home. Unfortunately, a system as vast as one which supplies piping hot water to the masses must be closed periodically for maintenance. In Russia, they usually do it by region; one neighborhood loses hot water for a week, then regains it as the workers move to a different region of the city. Here in Bishkek, they simply shut off the hot water to the entire city for a full month. 

No hot water for a month. She goes on to discuss the electricity, too.

Many Austrians agree that outlawing fractional reserve banking would eliminate the problem–it is fractional reserve that allows the expansion followed by contraction. Additionally, fractional reserve also constitutes contract fraud because it essentially creates two claims to one piece of property. Capital controls are not the solution; solvent banking is.

Doesn't Fractional Reserve Banking allow banks to make loans to consumers who will use that money to invest in certain things. IE: A car, house, etc. which is good for those markets? I don't see how that is a problem. If and when it causes expansion/contraction why not just let the free market run its course and self-correct?

&gt;If the government taxes the rich, it will spend that revenue. Either the rich spend it or the government spends it. Actually, taxes guarantee it will be spent–it’s no guarantee that the rich will.

If Fractional Reserve Banking is allowed, then couldn't those banks lend out that money that the rich are 'holding' in banks? That way, it's being spent and used in a productive manner to improve the economy.

&gt;Deficit spending is never ok

What about in times of war, or times when it's *absolutely* needed? I'm not talking about huge stimulus packages that run the debt over trillions of dollars, but rather small debts that we know we can manage.

&gt;Corporations cannot rule the world except at government behest. They are subject to the demands of consumers.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the average consumer kind of stupid? As in, they won't really research to see if there's any unethical or dishonest practices going on within the company. Also, I feel like once a corporation gets too 'big', it'll be able to create a free-market monopoly in a way and be able to run their competition out of business via lowering their prices due to how much extra money they have from big profits.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm currently an Economics major at the University of Alabama and I hope to attend the Ludwig Von Mises Institute in Auburn for graduate school. Austrian theory and the works of Hayek have really caught my interest lately.

My girlfriend and I recently got pregnant and neither of us are in a good financial position to have a child, as much as I really want to have kids. So yesterday, we got the pills and today she's in the other room having terrible cramps and conked out on phenergan.

This is my first (and hopefully last) interaction with Planned Parenthood. The city I live in has ONE clinic that does abortions, the rest are for other aspects of woman's health. The one we went to was run almost as bad as my residency's clinic (which is saying something) and we got to pay an exorbitant fee just to be seen 1.5 hours after our appointment (again, no procedure, just a pill). At one point my girlfriend asked me ""How can they stay in business being so inefficient and expensive? You'd think the government would offer abortions for free because *they save so much money in the long run*!"" I immediately pointed out that their monopoly was *because* of government, they already receive subsidy, and that human beings are NOT burdens to society, by and large, otherwise we'd have no productivity to tax to pay for this stuff in the first place.

It kind of occurred to me, listening to remarks like that from people and reading the threads in [/r/politics](/r/politics) others pertaining to abortion that people have a rather strange view when it comes to humans.

Sure, the book Freakonomics pointed out that elective, consensual abortions have a positive impact on crime in the long run, but how in the world can people think that intrinsically, the more abortions, the less burden/more stuff for the rest of us.

Human beings are the most precious resource of ALL. The left looks at the material resources of countries and thinks that's what makes them economically viable. In the long run, however, the labor force dwarfs the entire material resource industries every time, when the government gets out of the way and the labor force grows. 

Maybe it's these hard economic times, where it seems like if we could just round up all the people on unemployment insurance and welfare and send them to Bangladesh, all would be well. But I happen to think this feeling that human beings are just all mouths to feed and criminals is instilled into us with talks of overpopulation and socialized healthcare/schools/everything.

This misconception permeates every issue from Welfare to Abortion to Immigration. Everyone wants *fewer* people. Why not keep those same people, who are equally capable of making good decisions and producing more than they consume as us upper-middle class folks, and just put them in a position to succeed?",,False,self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,t3_pwebi,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/pwebi/human_beings_burden_vs_treasure_how_the_left/,

What will it take to pop the college bubble? As far as my understanding goes, college tuition (demand) is largely propped up by the US government's ability to lend money to students at low interest rates, and the guaranteed status of those loans by the US Gov. Furthermore, it is my understanding that 1) the college bubble will pop when interest rates on student loan debts increase, and students stop borrowing money to pay for over-valued, non-productive liberal arts degrees (the excess supply of degrees is apparent in the unemployment/underemployment of graduates) and 2) the sovereign debt crisis might be inflamed/caused by students' inability to make payments on their loans (which are guaranteed at the federal level to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars).

So which comes first? The US Bond market collapse or the inflated college market collapse?

It seems like a very likely scenario that if the economy worsens at all, there will be millions of debt-laden students failing to make any payments (even interest) on their loans, those loans will eventually be valued on bank balance sheets as liabilities rather than assets, and then the taxpayers are on the hook to yet again bail out failing financial institutions via borrowing at now-higher interest rates or monetization via the Fed...

1326815936.0,18,self.austrian_economics,okxzh,Why we should have competing currencies.,ThePie0fSauron,19,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/okxzh/why_we_should_have_competing_currencies/,"A lot of people don't understand the idea behind competing currencies and why certain people advocate them. I'm here to explain the best I can why you should at least consider auditing the Federal Reserve and allowing other things to compete with Federal Reserve Notes.

First of all, the federal reserve has a monopoly on legal tender, in a truly free society does it really make sense for one entitity to control what you can exchange for goods and services? Well it kind of makes sense because then everyone can use the same currency any where you go in America. So yes having a national currency is good. But auditing the Fed doesn't end the Fed.

Secondly, many economist will tell you that inflation drives investment, and this is true, but only for people who have the money to invest i.e. the 1%. How can the 99% invest their capital to hedge against inflation if they don't have the money to invest? Why in competing currencies of course! By having multiple competing currencies, people can invest in as few or as many as they want, and still use their money. Not only can they be used as a hedge against inflation, but they can also help to lessen the amount of inflation over time by having more currency to inflate.

Of course we know if the dollar crashes it hurts everyone who is invested in the dollar (most americans who have any savings, the ""99%""), but if people keep there savings in a diverse portfolio, this lessens the chances of a crash effecting them as badly as it would if they only had their saving invested in one entity. Having competing currencies makes it easier for the little guy to diverse his portfolio. In fact, if one currency does crash, it could potentially make the other currencies value go up, thus recouping your losses (at least to a certain extent).

I know many of you are opposed to the idea of a free market economy, and i'm not suggesting that deregulating banks is the best idea, but look what public pressure for the verizon 2$ convenience fee did. Not to mention the BofA debit card fee. We're living in the age of the internet. Plus there is no reason that a private entity can't audit the banks. If you leave it up to the government, only the 1% are going to be able to lobby them. And it's not like we wont get another liberal president.

I know a lot of people are against the gold standard and don't think it can work and are against ending the Fed, but I dont know of any prominent political figures that have a plan that puts federal reserve notes on the gold standard and/or ends the Fed. Most just want to allow gold to compete with Federal Reserve Notes, and completely audit the Fed. This would only end the Fed if it had a shitty monetary policy and no one wanted their tender because they didn't have faith in it.

**tl;dr competing currencies allow the little guy to invest his capital into more than one currency, and hedge against economic downturn.**

But does this actually make a nation wealthier, or is this just another Statist fallacy?",anarkhosy,19,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/18rxqo/i_have_to_assume_devaluing_a_currency_increases/,"So there is a lot of talk lately of devaluing a currency, using Japan as an example here--the Yen, to increase exports of a nation.  This probably does make products cheaper for other nations for the same goods, made in Japan, which will make exports rise.

The question I have is this:  in the end, does this actually make Japan (*or any other nation*) **wealthier**?  

...Or, is this just an **excuse** to print money?  Because in a devaluation, a nation's civilian population loses wealth and it has to play 'catch up' to regain that wealth back.  I wonder if the increased exports last long enough only to allow the private sector to simply catch up to where it was before the devaluation--which basically brings them back to square one with a net increase of wealth of **zero**.

Playing a thought exercise, let's say a State devalued a nation's currency by 99% in **one day**.  This would surely increase exports.  On the other hand, there would be a massive loss of wealth in the private sector.  In the long run, does that lead to a wealthier private sector, or is it just another way people have been duped into happily giving money to their government?

One article that comes to mind is [this](http://www.acting-man.com/?p=21391), with the interesting quote:

I am much less versed in history than I am in theory and math, so - is he right? And is the US really failproof?

&gt; I believe a diversified portfolio of assets will provide better risk-adjusted returns that simply buying a ton of gold, silver, foreign currency, or foreign stocks. I do not believe the US economy (and therefore the world economy) will fail. The US epitomizes the term ""too big to fail;"" failure is simply not be allowed to happen, even in the extremely unlikely case where economic forces dictate that it should. Our money has value not because it is backed by shiny metal but because it is backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. That has proven itself to be much, much more valuable than specie over time. It has allowed progress in the world through extending credit. Banks can thus amplify the power of money via the multiplier effect.  It is the basis of all modern economies, and going back to the gold standard would be a step backwards akin to trading shells or bartering homespun. **If geopolitical events would really bring down the dollar, why did the US dollar maintain its value during WWI and WWII?** Those conflicts were infinitely more traumatic to the world than the much smaller-scale skirmishes happening in the Middle East right now.

Some of the more common arguments in favor of bailouts are these:

•	Bailout of a company might be seen as a necessity in order to prevent greater, socioeconomic failures, bailouts can also occur to make social improvements (help struggling companies/banks and build them to be better), or for profit 

•	Bailouts are a necessary evil, the incompetence in management of any company or bank is an insufficient reason to let them fail completely and risk disturbing our (current) economic.

•	To many jobs will be lost if the government doesn’t step in and help banks when they are failing

•	After a bailout occurs, banks make sure that all customers that were affected by corporation’s failure are given any and all money that was borrowed or that is rightfully theirs back.

•	 If banks are not bailed out any company that relies on the bank for their finances have a risk of failure as well (small businesses depend on healthy and functioning banking systems.)

•	Our society is built on the idea that we help those in need in any way we can, though this does not mean it is easy to reach agreements about how to provide shelter, and sustainability to those in need, everyone must do their part.

•	The American Bailout bill helped homeowners facing foreclosure by guaranteeing them their much needed loans and assisting them in adjusting their mortgage terms.

•	Bailouts prevented bankruptcies, death of industries, loss of jobs and loss of confidence in the banking system.

•	 According to studies from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, job openings have increased. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the unemployment rate, as well as the rate of mass layoffs. 

•	By creating the bailout, the government is ensuring that more people will stay employed and continue to pay taxes, purchase consumer products and meet the needs of their families.

I understand as a matter of principle why it's not a good thing, and I can argue my way around these easily enough, but I'm curious if any of you have encountered these before, and how you dealt with them.

Edit - Sorry, I didn't bother to format it properly. Thanks to everyone who pointed it out; hope it's readable now.

Also, yeah, I've also xposted this to r/libertarian. Just wanted to see what you folks who are particularly interested in economics think.

There are some things I would like to research further, stemming from some questions I had reading this again. If any of you have links to get me started, they are more than welcome.

1. Restrictions on branching: why would ""keeping track of the value of currencies"" be a problem for the public? Money is a commodity like anything else, yet we don't see people having difficulty keeping track of the price of eggs, milk, and bread. Why is money different? I'm led to believe that there is something more to this issue that I missed. In addition, my *intuition* says that branching would prevent competition between currencies, encouraging irresponsible levels of bank reserves, but I would want some evidence to confirm this.

2. The Knickbocker Trust: what really happened? Why did the copper stock drop so fast? Were the trust's activities uninfluenced by legislation?

3. Why were shipping costs apparently too high for local farmers?

I also did a search within this subreddit for this kind of question, using different kinds of key terms, but found nothing.)

Many people, both young and old, are in a very confused state of mind right now of how to plan the rest of their careers, education, and finances.   It's an unusual time where the usual financial and educational advice (buy a home as soon as you can afford one, always go to college, invest in the stock market, etc.) isn't a safe bet anymore.  The older are investigating how to protect what wealth they have created and, if they're laid off, what career they can switch to, if any.  While the young are investigating what education and career planning have promising demand.  With how divorced universities are from the private sector today--thanks to gov't student loans--a college student will have a very tough time predicting what degree makes sense (even many of the engineering degrees are experiencing difficulties) by merely listening to his/her professors and advisors.  So, one of my aims is to do that analysis for the benefit of myself and close associates who will listen to my advice.

There are very few alternatives to college for today's young.  Long gone are the blue-collar jobs that were a ladder into the middle class.  This is one of the reasons why colleges have become so saturated and a clusterfuck of disinterested students not adequately serious about--and possibly not naturally intelligent enough for--their studies.

As a 24-year old college student with almost no wealth to protect, all I can really do in the current environment is invest in myself. I'm currently taking advanced courses in Applied Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, completing bachelors degrees in at least two of these and pursuing masters' in fields of chemistry.  I'm trying to absorb as much math, science, and engineering knowledge and credentials as I can in this time of uncertainty and stagnation, and, when many of the corrections hit and US goods-production is forced to resurge (Americans forced to also contribute value instead of merely consume it), capitalize on the movements and new industry demands to help myself financially and help those around me rebuild our lives and communities.  

Most of us here who have the benefit of the Austrian perspective are well-aware of the long-term decline in American goods-production and long-term increase in service sector jobs, consumption, and our trade deficit, and most of us also view this as economically-unsustainable.

So, what I'm trying to do is analyze, collaborate with, and compile the data of other like-minded financial analysts.  Specifically, I want to organize in detail data concerning American labor, consumption, and domestic natural resources.  I eventually want to extend this data to also include most of the major players on the global market in essential and emerging industries and products as any valuable conclusions drawn about the American economy will invariably integrate and obviously be linked to global trends, too.  I've already begun this, as I see it, monumental task of accumulating all this information using the BLS database as well as roughly 30 lesser known sites with good information on natural resources and production by country, but am probably only 5% along my trajectory and think I can greatly benefit and accelerate the process by building off any foundations that have been previously built.  Working alone, it would probably take me one to two years to get the amount of data and understanding of that data to where I want.

I have no pretensions of the difficulty in forecasting, but I think if one were to compile knowledge on all of the important economic interconnections within the global economy and natural resources locations, supply, and forecasted demand, one could be as agile as possible and make sound life decisions that would be cognizant of said realities, realities many of us strongly believe will come to pass witin the next 15-30 years.

So, has anyone already undertaken this task or know of someone who has?  I honestly don't know why someone like Peter Schiff hasn't already.  All I've heard him talk about is what he thinks is going to happen on an extremely-macro level, without any kind of forecasting of what types of American manufacturing would probably return when it did and what skills people should have (The easy answer to this is: that's ridiculously hard to do, but there's no sin in at least trying--you probably won't be *that* far off.  I would also imagine cheap political opponents would use it against you.)

That is, just because someone acquires wealth does not mean that someone elsewhere loses wealth. 

However, if money were tied to a scarce commodity like gold or silver, would the above argument still hold true?

**His response:**

You're ignoring reality here. Employees, especially poor employees, have relatively less freedom than their employers. When an employer fires an employee, it can usually still sustain it's business and, sooner or later, hire another employee. When an employee loses his or her job, he or she and his or her family lose, in whole or in part, their livelihood and income. The incentives of both parties are not equal. Employers frequently abuse employees because, for most jobs, employees are replaceable and employers realize employees have added incentives to keep the employee-employer relationship going.

Simply by sniffing the data for the years 1941 to 1946, one ought to have smelled a rat. Consider that between 1940 and 1944, real GDP increased at an average annual rate of 13 percent—a growth spurt wholly out of line with any experienced before or since. Moreover, that extraordinary growth took place notwithstanding the movement of some 16 million men (equivalent to 28.6 percent of the total labor force of 1940) into the armed forces at some time during the war and the replacement of those prime workers mainly by teenagers, women with little or no previous experience in the labor market, and elderly men.10 Is it plausible that an economy subject to such severe and abruptly imposed human-resource constraints could generate a growth spurt far greater than any other in its entire history? Further, is it plausible that when the great majority of the servicemen returned to the civilian labor force—some 9 million of them in the year following V-J Day—while millions of their relatively unproductive wartime replacements left the labor force, the economy’s real output would fall by 22 percent from 1945 to 1947?11 The utter implausibility of such developments suggests that scholars have placed far too much weight on the metaphor of a wartime production “miracle.”",,False,self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,t3_1k922i,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/1k922i/robert_higgs_explains_why_the_claim_that_the_us/,

I am an econ major who has been taught (so far) the Keynesian and Classical models of the economy. I wouldn't really classify myself as any school of thought, Im just curious (so please correct me if I am wrong!).

 In those models, interest rates sort of serve as a price level which coordinate the level of savings and investment (One could think of supply and demand except with saving and investment). From what I understand, Austrians hold to a notion of ""natural interest rates"" where a lower interest rate serves as a sort of false equilibrium. Then, as the Federal reserve raises interest rates, long term projects become unprofitable and thus resources have been miscalculated.

How can an interest rate be unnatural? If I understand the idea correctly, then equilibrium between savings and investment occur at any interest rate. 

Also, this cycle seems fairly predictable. Wouldn't rational agents understand this when making investment decisions? Perhaps Government actions are unpredictable and exogenous? 

Finally, what is the interest rate according to Austrians? (I'm sure there are differing views, but just in general) It seems in my unprofessional opinion to be a discount on future production, rather than a price on money?

1) What is the difference between the axiom of ""humans act to achieve an end"" and the assumptions of mainstream economists of actors being rational (i.e. utility maximizing) decision makers?

2) Economists build models based on logical assumptions and then test them empirically. My understanding of Austrian economics is its conclusions are deduced logically from the Praxeology axiom. Why then do they not test ABCT empirically? How have they lept from Praxeology to a rejection of empiricism?

I don't believe that no good thoughtful arguments against the Austrian School exist; I think that Austrians are such a minority, the status quo doesn't need to actually address their claims.  They are ignored in the same way the Democrats and Republicans ignore anything a Third Party would like to bring to the presidential debates by excluding them from the discussion at all.  If they even do mention them, it's to ignore them or fire spit wads at straw-men 

While I do enjoy reading Mises, I can't fully embrace Austrian economics if I don't know what the arguments *against* it are.  I would like to hear a strong, thoughtful, reasoned critique of Austrian economics from someone that the Austrians actually respect.  Not just a hit-piece by Krugman.

Decades ago, forest fires were seen as an evil to be eradicated. Whenever one broke out, it was extinguished as soon as possible. The result was that over time, dead trees and undergrowth created a tinderbox that caused extremely dangerous conditions and very large fires that could not be controlled. Today, we understand that forests and their occupants *need* fires to grow strong and healthy. Small, naturally-occurring fires take out many of the tall trees, allowing the sun to reach the forest floor again and giving new trees a chance to succeed and grow. Nutrients from dead and burned plants are returned to the soil to fertilize a new generation of plants. Certain trees have seeds that are only ""unlocked"" by a fire. While appearing catastrophic, a fire is a necessary and healthy part of forest life.

In the same way, when the government makes any attempt to prevent the economy from crashing, it is stopping new businesses and ideas from growing and blossoming, and keeping the old ones around longer than they should be. Eventually, the amount of ""dead wood"" in the economy creates conditions for an extremely severe and widespread crash/fire that destroys far more than many natural downturns/fires would have. Our economy, like a forest, needs to grow, develop, and burn according to its natural cycle. Efforts to stop the crash/fire are the root cause of much more pain for many more people, and a hindrance to healthy and vibrant growth.",,False,self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,t3_ww0f7,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/ww0f7/why_government_intervention_does_more_harm_than/,

Say a company, through the free market, was able to own all the oil fields in the world. What would stop them from holding prices incredibly high since so much of the world depends on oil? I know that alternatives will be made in the future, but what would be done about the present?

2. Similar to last one, but they don't own all the oil (just most of it). Say a new competitor came in and the near monopoly dropped its prices  so low that the other company couldn't compete, then raised their prices again.

  -I think I know the answer to this one, but just want to make sure that I have it down right.

3. How is gold not in a bubble right now and why its a good investment?

Edit: I know that the last one should be 3, but for some reason it is being auto-formated to 1.

The chart suggests that Reagans ""trickle down economics"" was responsible for the widening gap between the rich and the poor and that the solution is presumably to adopt some sort of socialist policy. 

It probably isn't valid to blame Reagan's policies given that the widening gap seems to start during Carter's presidency, not Reagans.  Is there an Austrian explanation for this?

My thoughts are that it might be related to the US leaving the gold standard but that appears to have happened 7-8 years earlier.  The timing seems to coincide with the [1979 Energy Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_energy_crisis) which was in retaliation for the US leaving the gold standard.

I became a libertarian and anarcho-capitalist in 2005. In 2006, I started studying Austrian economics. In 2007, I started [posting videos online](http://www.youtube.com/user/Nielsio); which is also the year I created the [V for Voluntary symbol](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/vforvoluntary#Thesymbol).

By now, I have a large library of valuable materials. The two main topics are: economics (how society works), and psychology (how the inner world works).

To get all that together I have put a lot of time, effort, and sometimes money, into creating videos, and editing those of others; which has often required getting their permission and establishing good relations.

Some of the videos that are doing well:

[**Image 1**](http://vforvoluntary.com/images/tumblr/succesful_videos2.png)

With that experience, I’ve been able to help other content creators as well, and continue to do so.

Another thing I’ve found the opportunity to do was start an [Austrian economics subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/) (a subreddit is a forum within the social news website [Reddit.com](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html), where the starter of it becomes the moderator). This happened 6 months ago. I have determined [its mission](http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/faq#Mission) as follows:

&gt;*The goal with this community is to be a place of respectful discussion, where the users feel free to communicate their thoughts, without fear of hostility.*
&gt;
&gt;*To this end all users are asked to refrain from personal attacks and down putting statements; and instead to be cordial.*

This policy (on which I moderate strictly), together with a set of guidelines that keep it usable, have allowed it to flourish. This does require a regular effort on my part to check all of the content and to keep an eye on the mood of the discussions.

[**Image 2**](http://vforvoluntary.com/images/tumblr/austrian_economics_stats1b.png)

*(monthly unique visitors has exceeded 10K since January)*

The respectful nature of the subreddit has aided in attracting some prominent Austrian scholars and promoters, and we have successfully held [Ask-Me-Anything question and video sessions](http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/faq#Ask-Me-Anythingarchive) with John Papola, Robert Murphy, Jeffrey Tucker, and more are coming up.

At the current rate, /austrian_economics will surpass 5,000 subscribers before the end of the year.

I also moderate [/vforvoluntary](http://www.reddit.com/r/vforvoluntary/) and [/libertariancomics](http://www.reddit.com/r/libertariancomics/), and I co-moderate ([after being invited](http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/mw5yb/ive_been_asked_to_become_comoderator_of/)) [/economics](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/) and [/unschool](http://www.reddit.com/r/unschool/).

From 2007 on, I was able to play poker for my income, which has allowed me to do all the things I’ve mentioned. Because of government intervention in the poker market last year, that has become more difficult. What I would really like to do is become full-time dedicated to the cause of understanding political and personal liberty and spreading those ideas; in cooperation with others. I have generated a little bit of income through advertising and links, but (monthly) donations can make it really workable. The more I receive, the more of my time I will be able to spend on it.

I have created a webpage that contains my [current plans and ideas](http://www.vforvoluntary.com/plans-and-ideas/) regarding content; which I will keep updating. As before, everything I create will be released for free and with a free license. I will publish the amounts (and not the names) I have received in [donations](http://www.vforvoluntary.com/donate/). I have been and remain open to all forms of communication: [email](http://www.vforvoluntary.com/contact/), skype and in real life.

I have setup a [second Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/VforVoluntaryTV), where I will be posting the videos of myself from now on, with the aim of getting Youtube partnered.

A bit more information about myself: In the past 3 years I have spent a total of 13 weeks in the United States, traveling to 5 different states where I stayed with libertarian friends and got to learn about their environment and their life. I am in a committed long-term relationship with a fantastic Austro-libertarian girl, who is into economics and psychology as much as I am.",,False,self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,t3_rfuom,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/rfuom/request_for_donation_subscriptions/,moderator

My question is why Austrians don't consider the means to an end chosen based on erroneous logic to be irrational.

For example, suppose I am working on a problem in mathematics, and I make a mistake somewhere in the problem that leads me to an erroneous conclusion. Usually, I would think of my error as an instance of irrationality because it contradicts the rules of mathematics. However, Austrian economists, as I understand them would acknowledge the error in my logic but don't consider it to be irrational. It seems that Austrians contend that the mere fact that I chose a means to attain an end (even if the means was chosen due to a miscalculation) to be proof of my rationality.

So bare with me :D 

http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14hpfc/econ_101_you_dont_create_jobs_because_you_have/

Every now and then I decide to venture into /r/politics to attempt to make simple arguments in favor of free market economics. Obviously I do not expect a majority to accept my views or even read them. So this isn't about votes or support. This is about me attempting to make better arguments in favor of sound economics. 

First I will admit that debating economics with people isn't  my strongest suit, I get confused and sidetracked easily but I do enjoy learning and better formulating my opinions. 

So here is what I attempted to say in regards to what creates economic growth and jobs. My explanation is that production which comes from savings and investment is the key to economic growth and job creation. Production is the horse, consumption is the cart. Where people get caught up in this argument is when you get into the ""supply side"" debate which so many individual on the so called ""left"" vilify. They say, ""you really think that supply creates demand!"" or ""Demand creates supply, without demand there can be no supply."" And superficially this is true. If people stop demanding Ipads, no Ipads will be created. But  I then go on to explain that everything that an Ipad is made up of must first exist in one form or another. So in a sense, without supply there can be no demand. This is where I may be getting my words mixed up and working counter to my goals in this debate. 

So help me better formulate my argument against the fallacy of demand creating supply or more specifically consumption making way for production. 

I obviously can find most of these answers below.

http://mises.org/daily/581/

But what I am more interested in hearing feedback from other people because these types of discussions will always come up in an economic debate. We need to formulate better arguments rather than simply quoting economists.

Now I'm not looking for anyone to go jump into the discussion for me, but I was hoping I could get some clarification about some things from some who are smarter than I.

Several comments down, he says:

&gt; The real interest rate, which is determined by the marginal product of capital, stays largely the same

Perhaps I'm confused, but I thought that interest rates were determined by time preference for money. And that expansion of money supply whether through fractional reserve credit expansion or outright printing, distort the perception of funds available for investment and thus apply downward pressure on interest rates. I have found [this](http://mises.org/journals/scholar/Murphy7.pdf) which I plan to read more fully, but can anyone summarize? 

&gt; Inflation and deflation don't alter people's time preference.

I'm just plain having trouble wrapping my head around that. For two situations that have opposite effects on the value of money over time, I'm having difficulty understanding that they wouldn't affect people's time preference in different ways. Am I missing something here?

In general, can anyone help point out any errors or misunderstandings I have in this conversation?

It seems to me that any theory of which relies solely on deductive logic would often times not be robust enough to adequately describe natural phenomena in economics, which begs the question of its utility.

So, instead of freely trading with other nations they decided to go on the war path. Japan had similar underlying theories.

I came here because I really have grown to distrust Keynesians to defend their own positions so that's why this post is here.  I'm really asking you guys to play Devil's advocate as best as you can. Thanks in advance.

My question is: why would a trillion dollar coin (supposedly, I know none of you believe this) not cause inflation? If it is being used to pay off debts, how is this not entering into circulation? Many of my mainstream economics friends claim that ""it won't cause inflation because it isn't entering circulation"" and that ""monetary base has tripled in the past few years and inflation isn't out of control at all.""  If the money doesn't enter circulation, what's the point? If you owe me money, then you pay it off to me, but I never spend it, then what's the point? If I don't need the money to spend, is it just to make me feel more secure and be able to further borrow or what? I just don't understand.

However, I need some empirical examples. Here's the catch though. To me it seems that whenever you bring up the concept of market self-regulation people will scoff, and they often do. That's not what worries me, however. I think the underlying assumption on their part is that the only reason markets self-regulate is in response to a threat of regulation by the government.

So are there current or historical examples of markets self-regulating without the threat of a government control or intervention? Any anecdotes are welcome, and I think would help make for a more powerful case for a normative argument in favor of free markets.

EDIT: After reading some of the responses I came to realize that this question is self refuting and almost impossible to make a case for empirically. That logical positivism is the method of social sciences in this day and age it is easy to proscribe differing causes to the same set of problems as someone else.

My professor said that the problem with doing it from an Austrian perspective is that there is a distinct lack of statistical basis. Does anyone know of a good book or article that has a good statistical basis?

EDIT: I have to write a brief outline of my paper for him. So far I have this:

I will focus more on researching the effects of demand orientated recovery techniques prevalent amongst scholars and politicians and the Keynesian analysis of the business cycle and how this impacts the market in the short term and the long term. My analysis will include the idea of governments being able to manipulate the economy through control of the money supply and inflation. I will analysis the effects of the New Deal and the current stimulus measures and their real effect on the long run stability of an economy. I will examine this model with reference to not only on the Austrian theory of the Business cycle proposed by Mises and Hayek, but also the Real Business Cycle theory proposed by Edward Prescott and Finn Kynland. I will also examine the relationship between unemployment and the rate of inflation as set out by the Phillips curve and how this relationship is used by governments to determine fiscal policy.(thank you rolante) 

Seem ok? I feel that he wants more of a research paper than a critique so it will take some rewording.",,False,self,t5_2stjd,1350044412.0,,,True,t3_11718n,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/11718n/looking_for_austrian_writings_with_more/,
