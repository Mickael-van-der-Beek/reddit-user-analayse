So happy that there is an active interest in this!  
I am by no means a pro - I'm actually studying to be a librarian, so I thought I'd do the nerdy librarian thing and put together some info on split toning for you.  
Split toning techniques are used to obtain different colours for the highlight and shadow areas of your images.  
I must confess that I love it a bit too much. Once I began shooting RAW and using Lightroom, it quickly became my favourite toy for post work, and I am definitely guilty of over-using it!  
It is an old film effect, where the images would come out somewhere between black &amp; white and colour, almost like a two tone sepia image. Often, when film photographers decided to use sepia toning, they found their image to have not completely bleached and this left a multi toned style image which was given the name split toning.^1  
It is simple to use, but using this tool effectively can be surprisingly complex.  
Split toning can be used to quickly and dramatically enhance an image, but care must be taken not to overdo it.^2 (I still need to remember this haha).  

**It is most often used for three purposes:**  

* [Simulating Toning upon Monochrome Images](http://i.imgur.com/Q2xAO.jpg)

* [Getting that Cross-Processed, toy camera / Lomo Look](http://i.imgur.com/NgF29.jpg)

## Practice File:  
If you don't have any RAW files handy, I've just taken a rather [un-impressive](http://i.imgur.com/pskE7.jpg) photo from my balcony, and uploaded a [RAW version](http://www.mediafire.com/?ee8aea1s2t6147c) (in DNG format) to mediafire.  

I hope some of you will find this helpful!

The image was selling pretty well and would only have been accepted if the logos were removed from the shot. (I have shot for stock, I know the requirements)

I have also shot for family, friends and paying portrait shoots. In all my experience I have never had anyone ask if they can remove a logo from an item of clothing.

I would like to encourage you, though, to take the time to grow in your knowledge of photography ""theory"" (so to speak). Many times the questions posed could easily be answered if you knew how your camera worked and how light worked. 

of course, it doesn't hurt to ask for advice, and to try to learn more via reddit. In fact; Reddit is a very good way to do it, there are a lot of excellent subreddits devoted to such things. Likewise there are a lot of good books and websites on the subject (""The Camera"" by Ansel Adams is a great place to start!). This subreddit shouldn't really be about that though. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not upset that this is happening: but If you truly want to be an excellent photographer you need to learn about how to use your camera to create beautiful shots before you learn how to use photoshop. Just like a darkroom: photoshop is a tool to enhance and accent your original intent for the image to make a good image better, not to make a bad image good. 

Anyways: happy creating!

There seems to be a lot of confusion about how [these double exposure portraits](http://www.christofferrelander.com/projects/we-are-nature/) were created. Most are slamming it as a simple Photoshop, but in fact most of the image was created in camera.

I went out to duplicate the effect after work this evening: [example 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/biehl/7682103690/) &amp; [example 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/biehl/7682103354/). This was all [in camera with RAW and Lightroom/ACR. ](http://i.imgur.com/5RC3T.jpg) It doesn't require adjustment brushes, clipping masks or layers in Photoshop. Although in effect, you are creating an image mask in camera similar to a  Photoshop layer set to 'Screen'. 

**In Camera How to Guide:**

Note: This is just a rough first draft of the tutorial. I may take a more in-depth stab at it (and other alternatives) if people take interest in this post.

You will need a copy of Lightroom or Photoshop. My examples are using LR v4.1; but you should be able to duplicate these edits in ACR, older versions of Lightroom or Aperture.

You'll need a camera that can take multiple exposure photos. I'm using a D800 image for this example, but just about all mid-level to pro Nikon's will have this feature (Canons are a little spottier and I'm not sure about Pentax/Sony/Olympus). As long as your camera can merge two exposures into one you should be set (you could also merge images in Photoshop[more info at bottom of post] and skip to step #4, but that takes out most of the fun from the shoot).


1. First you will need to setup the camera to take a double exposure (for Nikons: Menu-&gt; Shooting Menu -&gt; Multiple Exposures). This mode will add light values together to make the final exposure (e.g. 50% gray exposure + %50 gray exposure will create a final image of white). Note: make sure any 'Auto Gain' or similar auto modes turned off (It will muck with the in camera exposure blending and you may loose the masking effect). You may also want to shoot in Manual mode to keep exposures consistent.  

2. For the first exposure, take a strongly back-lit portrait with the background over exposed and the subject slightly under exposed. For example, stand in shadow of a tree pointing upward and out so that only the [sky surrounds the subject.](http://i.imgur.com/cyIJp.jpg) *Make sure you over expose the background to white.* The white will create the mask for the second exposure. 

3. For the second exposure, take the nature shot in the same manner as step #2 (background/sky over exposed and subject/foliage slightly under exposed). If you want the floating object effect, [make sure the sides of the second exposure are pure white/sky](http://i.imgur.com/C1QKX.jpg).  

4. Now you should be able to view the multiple exposure image in camera. Rinse and repeat step #2 &amp; #3 until you have some keepers. 

4. Import images into Adobe Camera Raw or Lightroom. 

5. [Convert the image to B&amp;W and tone to taste.](http://i.imgur.com/XxUmh.png) You may want to clip the highlights a little to clean up the borders and any area that  have exposure issues. 

6. Now you need to adjust the 'Tone Curve'. Using a custom point curve, [pull the top right point down just a little to about ~93%](http://i.imgur.com/Ehv38.png). This will push all white tones to a nice light gray. 

7. Finally, use the 'Split Toning' feature to tint the gray into a nice light tan color. [Set the 'Highlight Hue' to a yellowish orange hue and bump up the saturation to taste.](http://i.imgur.com/Dd9hu.png) 

You should end up with something [simlar to this.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/biehl/7682795464)


**Edit: Quick Photoshop How To...**

&gt;unfortunately some of us can't do multiple exposures... is there an easy way to do this without using that method?

Shoot the images separately in the same manner as above. Stack the images in Photoshop and set the top layer to 'Screen' or 'Add'/'Linear Dodge' blend mode. Then apply a[ B&amp;W adjustment layer, Curve adjustment layer and a Hue &amp; Saturation adjustment layer (although I'm sure the 'tint' feature in the B&amp;W layer would work too).](http://i.imgur.com/njZuf.png) You can use the two images I provided in the guide to test it for yourself: [image 1](http://i.imgur.com/cyIJp.jpg) and [image 2](http://i.imgur.com/C1QKX.jpg).

1330250785.0,39,self.postprocessing,q6kv4,Light Painting Tutorial,Jake2k,44,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/q6kv4/light_painting_tutorial/,"Light painting is a great way to light a subject since the results can be really cool and you don't need a ton of gear to get the shot, but if you've ever grabbed your camera and a flashlight and set out to get a light painted shot you know that's it's not as easy as it sounds. 

I've been using light painting for product photography for a couple years now but only recently have I started applying it to cars, so it's safe to say that I'm still learning but I feel as though I have enough knowledge to to share in the form of a small tutorial. 

I also encourage you to use this thread to share your own light painted photos along with a little info as to how you shot and edited them.


----------------------------------------------------


First a few basics:

-You're going to need a dark location without a lot of ambient lighting, the best spots are dark areas with dimly lit backgrounds so you only have to worry about lighting your subject. (See the Jetta picture below for an example)

-You will of course need a bright handheld light to paint your subject, work lights with rows of leds work well as do wide beam flashlights.

-To get a decent shot you're going to need a decent tripod, something that will not move once it's set in place.

{If you do get a few small differences due to movement between exposures you can use Photoshop's ""load files into stack"" script (File&gt;Scripts), just make sure you check the ""Attempt to automatically align source images"" box.}

-Be sure to set your white balance to match the color of your painting light, most cameras can set a custom white balance using a reference, usually a white card, but in this case you can use your light to paint a virtual white card a few feet in front of the lens.

-You will need to figure out how long of an exposure you can take at the location you've chosen, set up your shot and take a long exposure and see if there is any ambient light that will be interfering with your shot. If there is adjust the shutter speed until most or all of it stops showing up in your shot but keep in mind that whatever you set it to is how long you have to paint in during each shot.

-It helps to wear dark clothing so that you don't end up in the shot, also keep in mind that you don't want to be blocking the area your currently painting. You can avoid this by holding your light out to your side.

-Unless you want them in your shot be sure to watch out for light trails coming from your painting light when it's facing the camera or reflecting on your subject, the latter can be difficult and sometimes seemingly impossible to overcome but with a little practice and a lot of ""chimping"" you'll get it.

-Light as much as you can in each exposure to reduce the amount of blending you'll have to do in post but at the same time make sure you don't ""nuke"" or completely overexpose any areas.

-Make sure you have a lot of time to get the shot and it always helps to have a few friends with you if you're shooting in a not so safe part of town(which is where the best locations always seem to be)

-I'm sure I've forgotten a few so if I remember any I'll be sure to add them.

The following photos where made using [this light](http://www.amazon.com/Cooper-Lighting-LED130-Might-D-Light-Rechargeable/dp/B002T4AEGK/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330238238&amp;sr=8-5), but anything similar will work.

If you followed the tips above then you should be ready to shoot! 

The Harley picture was made from three shots and the others were made up of anywhere from 7 to 20 shots each. I first take a long exposure of the scene without any light to get my ""background"" shot, then I take several exposures while focusing on lighting certain parts of the car, side bottom, side top, front top, front bottom, wheels, hood, roof, ground and nearby background elements. After each shot I check to make sure my painting light isn't leaving light trails or reflected light trails in the cars paint that would be too difficult to work around during processing. It's a lot of back and forth but it's better than getting home and finding out you have a giant light trail that completely messed up a shot. Sometimes if I have a friend with me I will ask them to stay by the camera and tell me how each shot came out. 

I've found that the hardest part of most cars to light is the hood, a good spot to light it is from just above the rain tray, also after you shoot a few different cars you'll realize how much different paint jobs can change the way you have to paint. Light colored and flat or matte cars are cake, I freaking love em. On the other end dark and reflective cars are a huge pain, however when they're done right the resulting photos can be amazing!

So now that you're done shooting and you've packed up all your gear and walked the area to make sure you didn't leave anything behind(I learned that one the hard way) you get to head home for the ""not so fun"" part.

In Photoshop I load all the layers and, if needed, align them using the ""load files into stack"" script, then I use layer masks to bring in just the areas I want from each layer. In the BMW shot I didn't change the blending mode and on the other shots I used a combination of ""lighten"" or ""screen"". I'm still trying to figure out which method works best for me but I have noticed that when using ""lighten"" you might get some faint borders along the newly lit areas and with ""screen"" you will be doubling up on any stray colors in the paint caused from ambient lighting during the shoot. You want to get a nicely exposed car with little to no light trails, easier said than done but you'll get the hang of it and develop your own techniques after doing a few.

After I'm happy with the blending I merge them all together and do a little cleanup with the ""cloning"" and ""healing brush/patch"" tools, I usually remove large rocks, cracks, painted lines or trash from the concrete as well as any sign/light poles or other background elements that might be too distracting. Then using a combination of the ""brightness and contrast"" and ""levels"" adjustments and some masking I try to smooth out the lighting and bring out or hide details in both the car and background. These are usually set to a ""luminosity"" blending mode so they don't interfere with the color. 

Next I use ""hue and saturation"" and ""color balance"" adjustments to tone down distracting reflections and get the overall color I want for the shot, these are set to the ""color"" blending mode so they don't mess with the lighting of the shot. I can't give you exact numbers to use with these adjustments since every photo will be different so just take your time and play around with them until you start to get something that looks good.

Finally I'll add a little sharpening, save the PSD(in case I need to change something later on), flatten the image, and resize/watermark/save the photo. I then proceed to whore it out on forums, Reddit, and Facebook :P

Light painting is also a great way to get evenly exposed product shots and the best part is you can usually get away with a single shot if the item your shooting isn't too big which means less or no time spent editing. Here are a few that I've done.

These were shot with a small led flashlight similar to [this one.](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Bright-Heavy-Duty-Compact-Aluminum-Flashlight/dp/B000LIQQ7M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330238227&amp;sr=8-1) Find an area to shoot where you can shut out all the lighting, I usually use my kitchen. Set you camera on your tripod and set up your shot with the lights on, once everything is ready cut the lights and paint away!

As I said, I'm still learning myself but hopefully this tutorial will help bring about a better understanding of how these shots are done. Thanks for reading and don't forget to share your results!

Just wanted to share one super quick way that I use to add contrast in Photoshop. 

**Tutorial:** http://imgur.com/a/8LY9y

* 1.) Open image in Photoshop.

* 2.) Create new Hue/Saturation adjustment layer.

* 3.) Set adjustment layer to Soft Light blending mode.

* 4.) Adjust opacity/lightness/saturation. 

* (Try out the different channels as well!)



BONUS! (Easy little color grade): Select Colorize in the Hue/Sat adjustment panel and mess with those settings. Try something like Hue:40 Sat: 15: Lightness: 0

Settings: http://i.imgur.com/En78WEH.png 

Result: http://i.imgur.com/D1lWXkd.jpg

Hope this helps! :)


P.S.-Try different layer blending modes as well. O and different adjustment layers w/ blending modes. You never know what you'll figure out by just messing around! :)

I grew up looking at the beautiful images on the pages of my Grandmother's old copies of the National Geographic.  

Upon diving into digital photography several years ago I have looked for ways to emulate those tones and colors.  I found Alienskin and used that for a while, but couldn't help but think it didn't quite have the look that I was looking for.  It looked over saturated and, sometimes, too contrasty.

I then found some presets from the X-Equals (then Life In Digital...I believe) which, well conceived, did some crazy things with skin tones, aqua, magenta, and purple in the Kodachrome 64 variety.

I became slightly disheartened until very recently.  The advent of Lightroom 4 was a giant leap forward with its ability to change the individual R, G, B curves.  Another event that struck me was the rise of VSCO Film.  I began working on my project again, comparing images I knew to be shot on Kodachrome to my own digital work as I fiddled with my sliders.  The last piece of the puzzle was when I discovered a digital DNG recipe that had been color matched on a chart.  This seemed to be the last piece.

So this is the accumulation of a couple of years of work to try and get a preset that resembles Kodachrome.  I have four presets, actually.  The first is my basic, the second raises shadows and tweaks the curve slightly, the third lowers contrast slightly and tweaks the curve more, and the fourth is just the third but with a slight brown of split toning added to the shadows.

I'm going to guess that these really don't look like Kodachrome, but it is what I have and I personally like it.  Any tips, tricks, or ideas you have would be welcome!  Thanks for looking!

I am such a n00b. I've been playing around with Photoshop for ages, but never really firmly grasped the difference between the Opacity and Fill options. I always assumed they did the same thing.  
Well, it took [this short 3min tutorial](http://vimeo.com/13868502), by amazingly talented retoucher Natalia Taffarel - to show me the ropes.  

****

As it turns out, opacity works on ALL of the contents of the layer, including the blending modes, while fill only works only on the content of the layer. Changing the fill will not change the opacity of any effects that layer might have.  In the video, Natalia creates a light flare effect on a model, by blending a brush to color dodge, then reducing the fill.  
Hope some of you find this useful in your post work :)",,False,self,t5_2smai,False,,mod,True,t3_ily9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/ily9e/opacity_vs_fill_in_photoshop/,

1310809085.0,22,self.postprocessing,ir6w8,How I rate photos in Adobe Lightroom,erikpdx,22,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/ir6w8/how_i_rate_photos_in_adobe_lightroom/,"This is not strictly a post processing topic, but it is a photography workflow topic!

One of the most tedious tasks in photography is coming home with more than 500 photos from a shoot, or event, and going through and choosing the best 10-50 out of all of those.
 
My first pass through will usually be heavy on deleting. I'll hit x to mark the most clearly bad (out of focus, poorly composed) photos as rejected. In a sequence of multiple photos of the same thing, I may reject all but the best one or two at this point.
 
Next I'll go to the filters bar, and only show photos that are flagged or unflagged - essentially showing everything but the rejected photos.
 
This pass through, I'll take more time and look at each set of photos, choosing the best ones.
 
Here is how I decide to rate photos:
 
x: Rejected, no reason to keep this photo.
 
0: No reason to delete this photo. Not artistic and you might not ever do anything with it, but it's important to keep for some reason. An example of this might be pictures of a space before you set up, so you can keep track of any damage you might do shooting at that location. Or something that's simply not good enough to show, but not bad enough to delete.
 
1: Good photos. Well composed, in focus, good subjects. Worth keeping. If I am sending all good photos to a client, these will be included if they want a ton of photos to look through.
 
2: These photos are the best of each set. Ie, if I have a set of a few photos of basically the same thing, the ones marked 2 will be the best out of that set. An otherwise 2 worthy photo may be bumped down to 1 if there's a better photo.
 
3: Great photos. This is a little more arbitrary, but they're better than the 2s. I try to think of these as, if I am sending a client the best 20-30 photos of a shoot, they'll be all 3s.
 
4: Excellent photos. I only pick a couple of these, usually. These are the best photos from that day of shooting.
 
5: The best photos. I reseverve a rating of 5 for the best of the best out of the entire project. A photo rated 5 will be worthy of being in the collecton of the best photos I've ever taken.
 
So I make a couple more passes through the library this way, and I'll usually end up filtering out everything that's not at least 1, then not rated 2, then not rated at least 3 so I get things rated pretty well.
 
At this point I'll see how many photos I have in each catigory, and that's when I'll start through and do post work on the photos.
 
I hope this is helpful to anyone who has to go through and choose photos from a huge batch!",,False,self,t5_2smai,False,,,True,t3_ir6w8,http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/ir6w8/how_i_rate_photos_in_adobe_lightroom/,

Important edit:  *This is the nature of my problem:  http://mansurovs.com/is-your-browser-color-managed

It's something I've noticed before, but pretty glaringly in a picture I uploaded to facebook / g+ recently.  The picture looks warmer in Preview/Photoshop than it does when viewed in Chrome, and in this case, it looks much worse in Chrome.  I'll admit I don't really know anything about color profiles, beyond the fact that ""color profiles"" is a thing, and assuredly involves profiles of color.

In this pic as posted online, my dog's face is too dark to see any features.  When I look at it locally, though, it's clear.  How do I get on the web to look like it does for me when I processed it?

[side-by-side](http://i.imgur.com/CYqNL.jpg): http://i.imgur.com/CYqNL.jpg

When looking at the ""save for web"" options, I notice that if I select ""monitor profile"", it looks the way it does when viewed in chrome (in this case, terrible).  So which color profile do I trust?  Photoshop's uncorrected one, or what Windows thinks it should be?  Which is going to be closer to what everyone else sees?  

**Edit**: So if I take a *screen grab* of the open image, and save it with that, [it looks the way I wan't it to](http://i.imgur.com/Y7A31.jpg): http://i.imgur.com/Y7A31.jpg  There has to be something wrong with the way I'm saving the image from PS then, right?

I'm a GIMP user personally, and on the gimpusers Flickr group there is a monthly challenge to produce an image based around a theme.  I was thinking that it might be even more fun (and constructive for others to learn), if a challenge had the same base image for everyone to edit according to a theme.

So I went and picked out a RAW file of mine and donated it (licensed CC-BY-SA) for anyone to edit.  In my challenge I thought it might be fun to see what everyones B&amp;W conversion workflows looked like and produced, so the challenge was to take my RAW file, and convert it to a B&amp;W image (and to please detail what process/workflow you went through to produce the final result).

I have gotten a decent response, and I figured it might be fun to let others in on it as well.  If you use GIMP and have a Flickr account, [come over to the discussion and join in](http://www.flickr.com/groups/gimpusers/discuss/72157631670149577/)!

[GIMP Edit Challenge on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/groups/gimpusers/discuss/72157631670149577/)

If you want to use any other software, perhaps we could post the results here and vote on them somehow?  Not sure how to make that happen, but figured it would be fun (at the very least, I'd love to see how others approach this).

I was browsing the [ModelMayhem](http://www.modelmayhem.com/t.php?forum_id=18) boards, and found an interesting [thread](http://www.modelmayhem.com/po.php?thread_id=808393) on adding reflections.   

No, not [cheesy](http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/172342/172342,1284920646,2/stock-photo-piece-of-ripened-swiss-cheese-isolated-on-black-with-reflection-61284058.jpg) Photoshop reflections - but ones more similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/w25NJ.jpg), or [this](http://i.imgur.com/WBjrC.jpg).  You know, that ""*shot through a window - had a little camera-light leak but still ended up serendipitously cool looking*"" style?   


Now... ideally you would get this type of shot in-camera, and some of you will say that this post work ruins the photos, or it just looks plain bad.  But hey, it might be something fun to play with for a portrait on a rainy day, if you're feeling particularly creative.

I hope this is the right place to ask this question. 

I recently started working with a professional model on a one on one basis and I've done about 4 shoots with her within the last month and thankfully it's a paid gig.

She really likes my photos but she always asks for specific things to be ""photoshopped"" she's been in the industry for about 15+ years working with all kinds of magazines and catalogs big and small so I trust her opinion but at the same I feel at a loss. I'm not very experienced with photoshop, at least in the industry airbrush kind of way.

I mostly edit in adobe Lightroom 3 and use presets to the results I see fit.

How do I get better at photoshop and making my photos look more up to the ""industry standard""?

I get that that is kind of a loaded question.. And I know that a lot has to with lighting, makeup, and style. But there's also a lot of continuity in todays magazines in the way that women or men look like when it comes to their skin tones and curves. I've heard that some photographers hire other people do the post processing. That's not really a route I'd like to go down as I would like to better my craft but still maintain my own authenticity to my work.

Hopefully this doesn't get downvoted into oblivion. Just a young photographer looking for some help. 

Thanks!



**EDIT:** sorry about not responding I've been at work all day and I have two jobs so it's been a little hectic. I'll definitely add some specific photos of mine and what I'm looking for or who I think embodies work I'd like mine to eventually be at at least on a post processing level.

I'm a California resident and will be at work till midnight so I'll make another edit later tonight. 

Thank you all so much!

**EDIT 2:**
[My Shot](http://imgur.com/r1fxv)

[My 2nd Shot](http://imgur.com/Gq1jC)

[Photo she showed me/wants to look like NSFW](http://imgur.com/h0uNK)

[Another photo she likes in skin tones](http://imgur.com/JrVJS)


Just to clarify a little... she likes the skin tones. How they look ""equal"" more or less around the whole body. The coloring of the skin and how it looks the same all over. Personally I don't see it exactly, but she has shown me other examples. Not sure if I just need to train my eye. But I definitely know I can't tell if a photo is 'photoshopped' or not at times. Obviously there are certain cases when photos are extremely airbrushed. But it's in photos above that I feel like I can't tell if it's just 'a really good photo'. I know that lots of photographers can get a great image 'in camera' without having to do a lot of post processing. 

My photos she just wanted basic touch ups.
That I have no problem... Cloning and such.

It's just the skin tones issue I'm not very good at I guess. 

Making something look real, even when it isn't. That is my goal.

**THANK YOU all for your tips and suggestions.** I will definitely be doing some homework this weekend.

But i suck at using the curves/hue/saturation section, as well as all the buttons underneath the histogram sans the crop tool.

I also have a complete CS6 license (as im a lucky sob), but frankly I barely use it primarily out of lack of knowledge of the product/unfamiliarity with the interface in Photoshop.

Does anyone have any recommendations for tutorials to better expand my understanding overall and how to address the following things i want to do in either program:

* Cloning out unwanted objects
* Airbrushing/Skinsmoothing
* Selective sharpening
* Selective exposure adjustments

I've been trying to edit my photos in a certain way that isn't really common, and [this is a very similar style to what I've been trying to achieve for a long time](http://i.imgur.com/qZ1Ge.jpg).

What's going on here?  Is this actually an illustration and have I been fooled?  It is an image of an amazing illustrator after all...

If it is indeed a photograph, what processes did they use back in the day that resulted in this image?

My thoughts:

 - It looks like the printer presses back in the day were very strong on the reds, magentas and yellows but don't look very strong on the blue, cyan and greens.  Perhaps if someone could point me to the appropriate film process and print press information from that era (late 40's) I can go about and continue working it out myself.

 - Alternatively, could this be a black and white photo that's been colourised via airbrush or illustrated on top of?


In terms of the responses, I'm not looking for a tutorial or a set of filters etc.  Just some information on what you think of the photo, the production processes behind how it was made and just a direction on where I can look so I can figure this out on my own.

I am asking fellow redditors to share their expertise and experience with their processing equipment. So far, the big ones are as follow:

* **CPU**: important for speed of rendering and export; ~~number of cores matters less than speed of the processor~~ [NoisyZenMaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/zigp2/things_to_know_in_buildingpurchasing_a/c64v6il) keeps me honest: # of cores does matter for preview rendering and mass developer changes; 64-bit support is important for more RAM  
* **RAM**: go for capacity (8GB+); 64-bit OS for higher capacity (also varies among 64-bit OS options; eg. Home Basic vs. Premium)  
* **SSD**: helps minimize bottleneck caused by hard-disk storage performance; install OS (disable pagefile and hiberfil, enable pagefile on hard-disk) and applications on it (requires greater capacity), or simply use to dump current batch for every processing session   
* **GPU**: LR and PS6 is not really impacted by this, so you can save a penny and go for integrated with a nicer CPU; PS5 and earlier can use nVidia CUDA support; no GPU = less power usage = cheaper PSU/usage cost  
* **Monitor**: critical since it's your main interface, go for IPS or S-PVA; 8-bit colors or more; good color gamut coverage; and CALIBRATE    
* **Storage**: [NoisyZenMaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/zigp2/things_to_know_in_buildingpurchasing_a/c64v6il) adds that extra redundant storage (automated backups) is critical in the long-run; affordable considering low-cost.

I've not been taking pictures for a very long time but I'm already starting to see myself getting stuck in a certain pattern: I take pictures, put them all on my PC, play a bit with the raw files, think the results are okay, save them, play a bit more, save these results as well and am then never sure which pictures I should keep.

That way, I basically never get anything done. It's not like I *have* to get anything done but I'd like to. I'm currently using freeware to play around with my RAW files as my budget is limited and my money already went towards Photoshop, which I need for University. 

So my questions would be:

Do you try to get for a certain result and try everything to achieve this? 
As I said, I'm pretty inexperienced and I don't yet have an idea of what I'm trying to achieve when I start editing photos. I've read and tried a couple of the tutorials recommended for certain types of photos already but I guess it takes a lot of time until you can look at a RAW and say ""I know exactly what I'm going to do"". 

What do you do with the RAW files after you're done editing?
Should I just delete them so I can consider the photo to be finished?

What's the one thing that should be done to every single photo taken?
I personally find that a bit more contrast and the „s-curve“ improves pretty much any picture I've ever taken (there probably are situations where this doesn't apply but I haven't run into them). So is there any routine you just go through with basically any random photo you've taken? Do you sometimes not do anything and still consider them really worth keeping? 

I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit but since this is more about the postprocessing process rather than the photography itself, I thought posting it here would be a good idea. If it's the wrong subreddit or if there's a better place for my question, I'll delete this post, of course.

My grandmother also just got a tablet (which she still can't quite figure out lol) and I think she might enjoy seeing some of them if I could upload them to a website like flickr.


I've been looking at negative scanners on amazon, and so far have narrowed it down to the [CanoScan 9000](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-9000F-Color-Scanner/dp/B003JQLHEA/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349131879&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=negative+scanner) and the [Epson V600](http://www.amazon.com/Epson-B11B198011-Perfection-Photo-Scanner/dp/B002OEBMRU/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349131879&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=negative+scanner) (or V700, but the V600 will probably be fine). Enlarging an image isn't that important to me now, but it would be a nice option if I find some good slides/pictures in his collection. What are your opinions/experiences with negative scanners? Do you need to use the included trays with them?

I like to shoot in film too, so it would be nice to be able to scan my own negatives as well. (35mm &amp; 120mm)

1. Is there a way to shoot RAW+jpeg, and use the settings on the jpeg to match settings on the RAW?   
2. Or is it sufficient to do one RAW+jpeg, then in developer adjust settings on the RAW to have it match the JPEG, and then defaulting that preset to all images; my concern about this process is that those settings would vary based on environment (lighting, saturation, etc.)

I understand DPP should be able to do that, however, I don't find it to be as comprehensive of a PP product as LR (go figure).

Things are often less saturated, but color is still very expressive, and often is used to great effect to convey the sense of atmosphere. There's an almost dreamlike quality that's both blurry and not blurry, like you've been in chlorine a bit too long. Grays are stark and strong.

I've watched a couple videos on eliminating objects that are undesirable and removing them from the background. However, it seems I always tend to have such a different case than what is discussed in the video that I don't really get the help I need.

Below are examples of what I'm trying to accomplish:

I felt pretty accomplished, given the task at hand. And never using the perspective tool before.

I was recently at my sister's wedding, and tried to take several photos by hand of some items on a table, in hopes of later editing some of them together to create a more sharp image with many clear focal points. The end result turned out interesting, but sadly not nearly as good as I was hoping, as I had quite a bit more difficulty than I predicted combining them seamlessly, and in some areas you can still very clearly see the edges where they combine. Do any of you have any tips for how to stack focal points more effectively? Any tips for getting the photographs or later editing them? I feel like it might have been much better if I had used a tripod when getting the images, (but being at a wedding I didn't bring it).

Are they the same adjustment, with more customization using tone curves (ie where the cutoff is for each region and RGB channel selection). Is it completely redundant to adjust both basic tone and tone curve sliders?

In the same line of thinking, is split toning and adjusting the red/green/blue tone curves the same thing as well? I'm guessing the palette color selection in split toning just makes the RGB balance easier, but does the same thing as adjusting all these channels in tone curves.

Does this make any sense?

^those ^using ^RES ^please ^click ^link


Both came from the exact same RAW file. The first one I ran through lightroom, the second I ran through picasa. The one going through lightroom has a distinctly warm hue to it. 

I asked something similar to this on /r/photography's weekly question thread, and couldn't find anyone who could help me. A lot of people can't even see a difference between these two images. That's why the third image is there, just to show you that I am in fact, not trolling.

Please help. This is driving me crazy. I want lightroom to be able to export B&amp;W images that don't have a warmish hue attached to it.



**Edit**: To clarify, on which image is which.


Image 1 is the raw photo run through Lightroom4

Image 2 is the raw photo run through Picasa

Image 3 is a screenshot of my desktop, looking at the two images, wondering why the hell they're different.

**Edit 2- It's been figured out. Ty threedaysatsea for his assistance. Explanation below.**

Basically these images have two different color profiles. The one from picasa has been stripped of it, hence why it now has the cool B&amp;W tone that you all see. (and that I want to see) I'm still trying to figure out a way to get LR to not have this warm tone though, as I see it as undesirable.

If you've ever dropped by the photography board on 4chan, **/p** - you most likely ran into some of the helpful posts and often incredible before &amp; after pictures by /p regular - *Photoshop®*  
His informative but somewhat advanced (at least for me) blog can be found at [Photoshop® Archives](http://photoshoparchives.blogspot.com/).  
Last week, he wrote [why you should post process your images](http://photoshoparchives.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-you-should-post-process-your-images.html), which I thought might be appreciated by some of you here.  I would recommend reading it on his blog, (so many post processing goodies there!) but I'm also inserting the 'article' here:

***

&gt; This was a post I made to a thread where someone was stating that they don't post process their image and feel it takes more skill on the part of the photographer to work this way. I told them to post a picture that's straight out of camera and I'm sure I can improve it. They post an image, and I feel that I successfully improved it. You can see the image at the end of this post, but I suggest reading my reasoning first:

* Jpeg post processing has a hard time with separation of hue and saturation. There are ways to manipulate how we perceive color and saturation intensity (as long as you understand the theory of color relativity) but this takes a human mind to pull off. All the hues in your image were very red/yellow with a hint of green, and the saturation in your image was relatively even. This makes the color look more bland than it could be. By reducing the saturation of certain areas and pushing the hues further apart in others, we can make the overall color variety much more pleasing to the eye.  

* Jpeg sharpening is very unreliable. Sometimes stuff will end up under-sharpened, sometimes over-sarpened, and the noise reduction leaves much to be desired (although this is changing as technology progresses) In the case of your image it could have been pushed a little farther. Also your auto-post processing produced some slight aliasing. I tried to bring the sharpness up to where I thought looked best, but this brought out the aliasing. Had I had the raw file to sharpen, this would look leagues more appealing.  

* Composition adjustment by far in my opinion, is where the greatest advantage lies in post processing your images. Once you understand the way that people view an image (the basic: first looking at areas of most intense contrast, then detail, then saturation), we can fine-tune these to help guide the eye of the viewer to what we feel is the reason we took the picture, prevent their eye from naturally falling on random crap that distracts them, and keep their eyes from leaving the frame so they'll savour the detail and appreciate your image more. In the case of your image I added a subtle vignette to keep the contrast at the edges of the image lower than the middle to discourage them from ""escaping"" out the sides, also slightly decreased the saturation along the frame, removed all the random crap that their eyes would naturally fall on instead of looking at the good stuff (I'll get into more detail regarding this controversial move in a moment), and I didn't in this case but you can also dodge and burn to control local contrast, improve compositional lines, patterns, texture and all kinds of other crap. You can also locally sharpen or subtly blur areas to attract or repel the viewer, as well as tons of other methods. Personally I like to lead the eye of the viewer around my image with an iron fist.  

* So why would we want to do manipulate the image this way? Isn't removing some of the scratches and stuff cheating? It was there when you took the picture, so why remove it later? Isn't it dishonest in a way? Good questions! We view a 2D image and reality (that has depth) in a very different way. When you were actually looking at the organ, looking at the part you found interesting (the forms of the pipes, repetition of shapes/lines...etc), your brain ""defocused"" on the rest of the stuff/details that you weren't specifically looking at. I don't mean that it literally blurred your vision, you probably didn't even notice this was happening. This is why pictures typically have all kinds of stuff that we didn't notice at the time of the shoot (until you've trained yourself to make an effort to look for distractions like branches growing out of heads). Why shouldn't the viewer have the same experience I did when I was actually there? That's why I personally choose to remove compositional snags. If removing the scratches, nicks, and parts sticking out that caught a distracting highlight isn't something you'd do, then just ignore that and look at the other changes I made to your image. (I'm also not mentioning loads of ways our brains correct what we see in real life that isn't corrected by jpeg conversion like perspective and white balance - white balance in camera is good but not nearly as good as manually tweaking the temperature and tint sliders bla bla bla)  

* That's why I said I know I can improve an image that's been post processed by the computer in your camera rather than a human mind. The chances of you presenting an image that doesn't have anything that could be fine-tuned to more closely emulate the experience you had at the time of the shoot is so unlikely that it wasn't worth considering. As technology progresses and cameras become capable of recording higher dynamic ranges, more lifelike colors, and better focusing, this still wont be able to do the stuff that a good old fashioned human being can do by looking at the image in photoshop and thinking ""so let's see how I can make this picture more like the experience of viewing it in-person...""  

* [**pipe organ image mentioned**](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8xbBE8xrU9c/ThCF0QnoGAI/AAAAAAAAAOo/vSD12n3rAaw/s1600/postprocessing.jpg)  

***

**TL;DR**  

* Control the composition, force the viewer to look at your photo the way you intend it - same thing painters do

* Unedited photos can show all kinds of stuff we didn't notice at the time of the shoot, as or brain focuses on the bigger picture - not details like blemishes, etc...",,False,self,t5_2smai,True,,mod,True,t3_ijth8,http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/ijth8/why_you_should_post_process_your_images/,

The only difference seems to be that the tone-panel shows the actual delta curve that gets applied and that you can change the limits.

And, if there is no difference, then why are they named differently - eg lights versus whites?

My normal editing process is to set a contrast curve in the tone panel, and then adjust sliders in the basic panel. But I notice some people adjust sliders in both panels.

I have a 5D3, so that means to get my RAW files to work with LR3 I have to convert them using Adobe's DNG converter.  

This process takes a while (sometimes as much as an hour), and in the meantime I'd like to import my JPEG's and make a couple passes on them to pick my 'picks' and do a little rating.

I want to see if it's possible to import the JPEG's, make passes on them, then afterwards import or copy the resulting DNG's to the same folder, and have the ratings/flags apply to the DNG's.  Aside from the file extension, both JPEG/DNG files will have the same filename.

Will this work?  I usually shoot straight RAW, but the 5d3 gives me the luxury of shooting small jpeg for use with a eye-fi card, or shooting full size jpegs on a bigger SD card in case of the CF card or RAW file corruption.

I've tried Photo Mechanic and it while it does read my .CR2 files natively and quickly (LR3 won't), I find the color rating system and general controls to be unintuitive to me, and prefer to keep my workflow in one program.

So recently I've noticed I get some shots that almost looked washed out in certain areas? I'm not sure if it has something to do with the white balance, or maybe the contrast, or even if it's due to shooting in the bright sun? Actually now that I'm looking at them again maybe it's something to do with the exposure?

I've also been editing them in Camera Raw through Photoshop...my plan is to get lightroom soon.

These pictures are from a couple weeks ago. I know they're nothing spectacular, just wanted some new ones of the gang. And I know they  should be alot sharper, something I've also been struggling with as of late.

I've used selective coloring to lower the levels of black in the blacks (does that make sense?), and I've used curves to raise the blacks - but it never ends up looking quite like I want it to. 

[this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ssperber/6812787547/in/photostream) is the closest I've come, but it still doesn't seem right. Should I make sure my shadows are deeper before messing with selective coloring, etc.? Am I barking up the entirely wrong tree?

Over the past few days, you may have noticed some changes to this subreddit, specifically updates to the theme and the ability to choose your own flair.  This has been part of an effort to make visiting our community a more enjoyable experience, with clearer and cleaner visuals so you can focus on submitted links and posts.

You may also notice, however, that submissions are few and far between here, with only a few posts a day.  A look at our [activity curve](http://i.imgur.com/EdXKn.png) graph shows how much activity here fluctuates (compared to [/r/photography](/r/photography)).

####You can help.

---
We want to create a vibrant and active community here at [/r/postprocessing](/r/postprocessing), and we can't do it without your help.  *What do we need?*, you may be asking.  Well, firstly we need feedback - let loose and tell us everything you want improved here, whether you want stricter rules or just don't think our logo is pretty, we want to hear it.

We also need you to spread the word.  Now, that doesn't mean spam every post with a link to this subreddit (that would make us look bad and defeat the purpose), but when someone asks for help with processing their photos, send 'em a link.

####Our plans

---
At the moment, we've got a couple kinks to work out with the new theme.  We also want to try to implement a way that makes sharing settings from Lightroom/Photoshop/Aperture/etc. easier.  jc4p has also suggested a weekly processing challenge, that ~~we will try to organize~~ you can find info about [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/o4h5r/post_processing_challenge_the_beginning/).

As you can see, the LR image looks way over saturated and contrast-y.

Some details about the photos: They are a 32-bit HDR image created from 3 RAW files. I used Photoshop CC's new Camera Raw filter to do the post-processing after the HDR was created. 

No other adjustments were made, either in Photoshop or Lightroom.

I have the same problem with LR 4.

I understand that beauty is subjective, we all have tolerances for how natural or edited an image should look, etc., and that makes this difficult, but I am very frustrated at not having found a more cohesive approach to furthering my post processing skills. I can find tidbits here and there on specific tools/techniques, or if I'm lucky somebody will document their workflow for a shot or two. Even broader stuff like a Luminous Landscape video I watched about processing into black and white seems to be both specific to a small use-case, and within that still very subjective. Perhaps I am attacking this the wrong way and need to think of this not as a single process of many minute interrelated revisions but a repertoire of individual tools and techniques to be used independently as needed?

I know where the tools are in Lightroom, I just don't always know what they do, how to use them on their own, and more importantly how to use them all in conjunction as part of a cohesive intentional workflow.

How did you guys out there in redditland get into post? Would it be valuable for me to learn film processing with the explicit intent of carrying that knowledge over to a digital workflow? Should I prioritize learning that over learning digital post? For instance the Ansel Adams trinity has been on my to-read list for a long while, maybe that will give me some of the foundation I'm looking for? Are there any books/websites/videos/sources of information that you would recommend pertaining to the fundamentals of post processing?

edit: I use a Canon 450D and shoot raw+jpg unless I'm doing motorsports where I need as much free buffer as possible. I have Adobe CS5 Design Premium and Lightroom 3.

I saw these fox pups off the highway and shot a few pics from the car. The sun was shining right at me, and I'm not a pro photographer so I didn't get the settings even close...

Anyway - had fun post processing it to see what I could get...I used dxo optics, and here's generally what I did:


* Exposure correction: -.125 (lowered the exposure)
* Lighting Correction - Medium (highlights/hdr style fix)
* Black point: 40 (increased blacks)
* White point: 225 (reduced white overall value)
* Gamma: 2.14 (lowered gamma value)
* Global Contrast: 2.14 (increased by a fair bit)
* Tone Curve:  slight S curve....heavier toward bottom
* Colour Rendering: ""Fuji FP 100C"" film ICC profile applied (really brought out the greens)
* Unsharp Mask: -1 intensity, .6 radius, 29 threshold (complete guesswork)
* Colour contrast: 62 (increased)
* Saturation: 20 (Increased)
* Cropped, then added a medium vignetting to highlight the fox a bit...

In Photoshop, this is the basic process I used:

* Import the images and then do a photomerge to align them.
* Put them in reverse order in the layer stack.  The primary picture goes at the bottom.
* Add a layer mask to each layer except the bottom one (the main image).
* Fill each layer mask with black
* Move your way up from the bottom and paint white in the layer mask to reveal the hands on the next layer.
* You might need to tweak the alignment of individual layers to get it right.  I had to duplicate some layers to put a left hand on one and a right hand on another to get things aligned correctly.

What I also discovered is that the image in the original request for help I posted is two people.  One the main model, but most of the other hands had to be from someone else.  As soon as we tried it, it became immediately obvious that only a double-jointed contortionist could pull that off.

Let me start by saying I'm very inexperienced with photoshop and I am still learning how to properly use layers and masks. I'm stuck with an image that I took in the [harsh Zambian sun which has left a harsh blow out on the forehead of my subject](http://i.imgur.com/nbJrw.jpg). The image was shot in raw but there isn't much detail to be recovered from using highlight recovery as most of the spot was fully blown out. Here is the shot out of the camera for reference [without recovery](http://i.imgur.com/e5yC1.jpg) and [with 100% recovery and the exposure lowered a bit.](http://i.imgur.com/8tPrL.jpg). 

How would you go about getting detail into that spot on his head? I was thinking of blending the recovered original with the edited photo, but I'm not sure what would be the ideal technique (type of mix, any additional cloning or texture, etc) . Any ideas of the steps I should take? 

I can upload a raw if that helps, but I'm more looking for advice rather someone else to do it. I'm here mainly for the blowout help, but if you have any other feedback on the editing I'd love to hear it.

To me it looks like the lighting is basically Rembrandt with a hard light, maybe with a bit of fill, but the main light is probably either a big softbox, beauty dish or bare flash.

PP seems to be (and this is where you can help r/postprocessing) either one of those ""70s"" look presets or basically boosting the blues and desaturating a bit, maybe vibrance -30 or so (for people who speak lightroom).

I've found some RAW files for you to play with!  read on for details...  

Right now, I'm just learning the basics of working with RAW files, and I have some past experience doctoring photos in Photoshop - but ideally I would love to get a grasp on photo retouching - you know, the stuff you see on billboards and in magazines, *(and hopefully we'll have tutorials on that here soon!)*.  

So I've been creeping **/p/** on 4chan, and slowly learning new things by following the [awesome work](http://www.modelmayhem.com/portfolio/1288061/viewall) of the photoshoparchives.blogspot guy!  

Anyways, while creepin his work, I came across **[this free RAW repository](http://www.digitalphotoshopretouching.com/free-raw-files-for-retouchers)**  resource for aspiring retouchers:  

&gt; *Aspiring retouchers, we understand how hard it can be to find RAW image files for practice or portfolio building when you are starting out. There’s that silly catch 22 – Photographers don’t want to give you files because there is no retouching portfolio but you can’t get a decent retouching portfolio unless you have the files! So here you go, no more catch 22: use the bellow RAW image files for practice and/or for your retouching portfolio. The RAW files are captured with a Hasselblad H3D39, Canon 5D, Canon 5Dmk2, Canon 1Dsmk3, etc and provide great resolution and detail.*   

****
  
So while you may not know much about dodging &amp; burning, frequency separation and carving... (at least I don't) - maybe these files will motivate you to read up on retouching techniques, or they will at least help you practice your RAW conversion skills.

I'm looking into getting my wedding photos edited by a professional and it looks like all the services online are more for photographers. I guess that would be because most people ended up with a professional photographer.

Quick back story: My husband and I has a tiny destination wedding in Iceland in April with 5 of our friends there, we all jumped in the car on the day of the wedding to get to the hotel/church and the weather turned really bad. Pure white out conditions and we had to go over a mountain range twice (worst experience of my life), and came fairly close to going off the edge due to stopping to help a couple that got stuck in a snow drift (always, always have snow tires on!), oh and my husband fell over and cut his hands up, and almost fainted.

We were lucky that we got there safely and the priest arrived! It turned out it was the worst snow storm they had in years.

We had two friends who like to take pictures so they were on photo duty. But, they aren't professionals and both admit it. One of them did creative industries at uni so she knows how to use photoshop, but we only have 20 photos from her, (Which is fine because we didn't pay her, and she is doing it in exchange for me baking her 3 tier wedding cake in October) but when I look at other peoples photos I get a little sad. Almost to the point of wanting to go back and do a re-shoot with the professional.

http://shootdotedit.com
http://evolveedits.com
http://colorati.com

Are some sites I've been looking at.

Now the actual questions!:

Does anyone know of an sites that work with non photographers?
If I can manage to find some one, what is the average price? I'm guessing it would vary by skill and things like that.

I downloaded the trial version of photoshop cc and it's so fun to play with and I have no idea what I'm doing! I figure some one who has more clues could make my pictures amazing.

Any help or ideas any one could give me would be really appreciated.

Update: 
A couple of people offered to have a look at some, which is stupidly nice so thank you so much!! I threw them in a drop box folder so feel free to have a look and play with them in any way. Some were shot with a really bad resolution so they are grainy, some are blurry, some just need lightening, cropping. Feel free to make them feel weddingy.. Sure that can be a word! Feel free to do as little or as many as you want. :D

I've been thinking about using a different program for stitching because Ps sometime takes too much time and manipulation to get the panorama exactly how I want it. 

* Any recommendations for a better program?  I've heard good things about **Hugin, PTGui, AutoPano Giga**, but I'm not sure which to use(or if there are better options).  I like that Hugin is free, but is it worth it to pay for the other programs or is Hugin just as capable.

The car body ends up having a halo which is ok if thats what you were going for, but I would prefer not to have that. The wheels also look slightly blurred, but when I add more radial blur it doesnt look as if the spokes are moving like in the other pictures, and the end result was minimal movement. 

The rest I did in Lightroom, split toning and increasing the clarity mostly and brightening the orange to make it pop. Then back in PS to give the sky and floor slight darkening gradients.

I'm an amateur photographer with a basic DSLR which I try to use whenever I get the chance. About a year back I captured a shot which I've considered one of my better photos ever since, and now I'm finally considering getting it printed and framed to hang on the wall somewhere. Unsurprisingly, I'd like it to be post-processed nicely before spending a bunch of money on the print.

Currently I have two (very) slightly different versions [(a)](http://i.imgur.com/Lal0w.jpg) and [(b)](http://i.imgur.com/TXvU3.jpg), where the main changes in the latter consist of a slight boost in clarity, a slight lowering of the temperature, and an attempt to salvage some of the overexposed and underexposed areas in the sky and the ground, respectively. I'd say the overall ""mood"" in these two versions is along the lines of what I'm going for, but I'm really not sure if I've done a horrible job processing the image.

Therefore I turn to you: What would you do to this image? I'm somewhat well-acquainted with Lightroom, so I'm not looking for someone to process the image for me, but rather just some pointers on what I could do to improve the photo, though not necessarily change it drastically. What are its strong and weak points? What should I try to emphasise and understate? et cetera.

We shot at the national museum of natural history in Stockholm, which is a phenomenally beautiful building with great exhibits perfect for backdrops.

Anyway, for the PP I thought I'd do a _slight_ weathered, faded look, while still preserving the vibrant colors of the characters as they appeared in their respective games. I did a quick preset which mostly pulled up fill light, added some blues and yellows to shadows and highlights, and did the usual contrast/clarity adjustments. All in Lightroom 3.

It looks good, but I thought I'd ask for more tips on methods to create the faded look. I pulled a little at the saturation/vibrance sliders, but I don't really know how far I can take it, and whether there's something more I should counteract it with.

So, any tips are welcome, and I'll update this thread with example photos later if you want (I'm currently at work).

**Edit:** Sorry for not putting up any photos yet. I was swamped yesterday after work, and simply didn't have time. I appreciate the tips you've given me so far, though!

**Edit 2:** Sorry again, I went with the initial look, and the client liked it, so I finished the photos that way. I will link the photos as soon as I'm allowed to upload them, and perhaps give you some before/after and walkthrough of what I did as well.

I've been using the trial of Lightroom 4 for almost a month now, and I really do enjoy it. It's almost time for me to buy it, so I thought I would look up prices.

However, when looking, I found that PS elements is only 70 dollars for the full version (non student), while LR 4 student is 80 dollars. I am a student, so neither should be a hassle, but which one should I invest in. 

Here are the links: 

PS ELEMENTS: http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-65136385-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E

Want to salvage what I can and make a nice present for my wife.


So we got a photog who is a family friend to do our wedding photos. The guy used to do weddings and was very confident in his abilities and leading up to the day, he was helpful and assured us everything would be great. Even said he had a professional friend who could post process some of our favourites for us.

On the day, it was a total mess. The guy had no idea and could not direct anyone. Frankly, we only really have a few good shots and a couple of great ones. His post processing mate was horrid. and made my wife look cross-eyed and derpy. I am so saddened by all of this and over a year later, we have only a couple of small photos out on display. No album and no really nice prints on the wall. The wall prints I would so love to have in our new house when we move in in a few weeks time.

So my question is this to you all. Can I please have some recommendations of good blogs/tutorials for using Lightroom and PS? Even some simple tips and I will ask form some critique as I go along. I'm not going to post up 100 photos and ask for them to be fixed as I want to do this myself. I also have thousands of photos from world holidays to America, Europe and our latest, the honeymoon to Egypt, that I want to work on.

But I can't figure out how to do this in a non-destructive, non-linear way. Eg. Can I tweak the DNG in Lightroom, then bring it into Photoshop and move elements around, then go back to Lightroom to tweak the DNG some more but keep the changed composition? It seems like once you bring it into Photoshop you have to ""flatten"" it to a TIFF which means you lose the advantages of RAW from that point on. After a while I end up with many versions of the same file, with names like IMG_6796-Edit-Edit-Edit.tif.

Photoshop manipulation is not my strong point at all, but I felt I managed to make it appear as if this was not heavily altered.

Did I effectively accomplish the goal of removing the distracting background? How could I have better made it seem like a seamless background from left to right - as on the left side (which is a slight gradient)?

Processed - http://www.flickr.com/photos/goopie/9075490281/sizes/k/

Beyond removing of distractions in the background, I also used a high pass filter for sharpening.
Before moving the image to photoshop I did the following in Lightroom 4
 - applied lens correction
 - adjusted tone curve to strong contracts
 - reduced Hightlights
 - lightened shadows
 - deepened blacks
 - boosted Clarity
 - boosted Vibrance

The photos are actually worth keeping too - I did 9 months of rock climbing, so they are more than just ""this is me in front of &lt;insert shitty boring monument here&gt;"".  I have included a sample of some of them (admittedly they are some of the better ones) to show the type of photos I'm dealing with.  Lots are outdoor action shots with elements of landscape in them as well.  

Now, my brother and I, only had a point and click camera each, so our photos are pretty much all 10 megapixel jpegs.

I want to retouch a selection of the photos (~100 or so) to make a book out of them to remember my holiday by.  I have attempted to retouch a few of the photos myself and even printed one or two of them out however it was a very time consuming process and I didn't really know what I was doing.

I don't mind spending a bit of time on this, but I would like some advice and maybe a pointer or two.

What is the best way to go about creating a book, with a chapter heading, a paragraph or two, then a caption for each photo?  I have CS Collection 5 but don't know how to use it.

When I have printed out photos, with my own printer and Office Works (similar to Office Depot but Australian), they have been really dark - the shadows which show up fine on the computer screen just look black when printed.  How do I fix this?

Are there a few simply ways processes which basically help any photo?   

Most importantly, will everything come down to my judgement?  (I have played with contrast/brightness/saturation/vividness and a bunch of other things in 'Camera Raw' (pre-photoshop processing) and I can see that it changes the photo but I can't really tell that well if it improves it or not.)

Is there an easy option?  Are their services online where you send them a bunch of photos and they send you the fixed up ones back.

I was walking past a fence today and I started wondering if there are any (hopefully automated?) ways to remove, for example, a fence in front of a subject such as a building by taking multiple pictures from slightly different angles to the point where you have image data in at least one of the images for each part of the building and then combining the pictures filling in the fence with the data from another photo?
Thanks.

Also, I remember a tutorial about tripod mounting the camera in a busy place and taking multiple photos. You could then use a script or something in photoshop to combine the photos and anything that moved between shots would be removed. I can't find this tutorial anymore.

In order to get the print here in time, I need to upload it in a few hours. I have been post-processing like mad, but now I have some doubts. 

I have a Dell Studio 15 laptop with a W-LED screen. I calibrated the screen some time ago with a Spyder 3 Express. That calibrated color profile is correctly loaded. I shot the picture with a D300, in RAW. Did some exposure correction in Lightroom 3. Did sharpening, eye-enhancement, etc. in Photoshop CS5. I am quite pleased with the result, but now I doubt if my screen will give an accurate result for the print. When I turn the Spyder 3 calibrated profile off, the image looks very cold/bland. I don't have the hardware here anymore, so can't recalibrate, and I cannot make a test print. So I ask you to check the image on your own screen and judge the colors, tint, white balance, etc. **Does the image look good on your screen?** .

Any other comments on the processing? I was a total noob when I started, but I learned a lot while doing this!

Thanks so much for the great comments. I made some changes and the previous version looks horrible in comparison IMHO. [**The improved version**](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6746311/improved.jpg). More feedback is of course still very welcome :) .

btw: I may have made the image a bit too dark partly because my screen is uber-bright. I set it to a decent level (60%), but unfortunately, AFAIK the screen brightness is impossible to calibrate for my setup (laptop screen with Spyder 3 Express).

The plain version is more or less straight from the camera with very little post processing (crop, tiny exposure adjustment, bit of desaturation to calm the red jacket, a minor vignette).

I've made [3 short demo videos](http://acrpresetmanager.com/video-tutorials/) showing how to use this, and how this can really enhance your workflow. I highly recommend checking out the third video as it shows the true power of this application to speed up your daily working process in Bridge and Camera Raw.

I normally use lightroom 3.0, but I don't think there are any stacking features that I know of and searching for stack brings up the organizing feature.  I downloaded GIMP tonight so I have zero familiarity with it.  Thanks in advance!

Anyways, [here is the raw image](http://www.mediafire.com/?8jr831shaha1trw).

In Lightroom, I upped the exposure a bit, dodged the pants to get some detail out, desaturated greens almost completely, then adjusted the contrast and shadows a bit.

In Photoshop, I adjusted the curve on the darks, giving a slight grey film to the image (I don't know the technical term for this). I added a warming photo filter, shifter the color balance to add some blues, and did a very very slight high pass filter.

One of the main things that I use photoshop for is to build pages for photobooks. This is especially useful when setting a background for a page and then laying out multiple images on that. Beyond that, I'll occasionally (_very_ occasionally) do things like portrait retouching including skin smoothing and cloning out hairs.

CS3 is pretty slow on my Mac (iMac i5, 2009) and I was hoping that an upgrade to a 64-bit compatible version would help with that. Additionally, CS3 doesn't support the RAW format of my camera (Nikon D300s) so I have to use extra disk space and conversion time to get DNG images.

I really want to use more smart objects for backgrounds. Is this something that elements can do well ? 

I can't really justify the CS pricing in the future for a hobby, especially as they've said that you will have to upgrade each version or lose the upgrade option, so I'm looking at other solutions right now.

I'd prefer choosing a product that lets me move from the Mac to a PC in the future, which rules pixelmator out. Gimp is out for a variety of reasons, but mainly the slow release cycle and UI. Any other suggestions would be most welcome too :)",,False,self,t5_2smai,False,,,True,t3_szhg4,http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/szhg4/buy_elements_or_upgrade_ps_cs/,

What I can't get is a simple, clean look like [Tara Whitney](http://tarawhitney.com/justbeblogged/2013/05/sunny-san-francisco/) and [Solar Photographers](http://solarphotographers.com/blog/2013/05/03/fun-engagement-pictures-at-ward-meade-park/) aka [Happy Family Movement](http://thehappyfamilymovement.com/2013/05/the-portrait-project-week-67/).

The style seems similar but I cannot recreate it. Tara Whitney says she shoots with Canon and I'm pretty sure she shoots only jpeg on standard shooting style and that she does very little ps work. So she basically uses a good camera/lens with factory settings and gets shots like that? The Solars don't say anything about their photography technique or equipment.

I tried to change it around, and so I lowered the tone curve as a whole, but more on the left side than right. I made it black &amp; white because it is meant to be sad; this is my grandma's departure, and to her left and right stands her granddaughter and daughter, respectively. At that moment, she was extending her arm to get a hug from the granddaughter before she leaves.

It seems that the main two contenders are VSCO and Alien Skin Exposure. I'm kind of leaning towards Exposure as I was fairly happy with my limited use of the trial, and it seems to have a greater breadth of stocks available. I also see a lot of people that are able to immediately call out when VSCO is used - not necessarily a bad thing, but it seems to lead to some pigeon-holing.

Some more info: 
- I have Silver Efex already so I'm more interested in color stocks.
- Needs to be compatible with Lightroom and do batching, although it seems most are.

PS - I tried searching but didn't find anything that jumped out of me, so I apologize if this has been asked before.",,False,self,t5_2smai,False,,,True,t3_1eogmx,http://www.reddit.com/r/postprocessing/comments/1eogmx/best_film_emulation_plugin/,
