**Reference Site:**

First, if you're someone who enjoys gesture drawing you may have noticed a few places shut down recently. Sadly it looks like ArtsyPoses and Lovecastle are both dead. In an effort to fill their shoes, we're happy to announce the creation of this: [http://reference.sketchdaily.net/](http://reference.sketchdaily.net/)

It doesn't have as many pictures as the other sites had yet (currently sitting at 800ish), and I'm sure we'll find a few issues with it once people actually starting using it. If you do find problems, please send me a PM with the info and we'll get it fixed up as quick as we can. Note that the body parts/animals sections are very sparse. Almost all the pictures are in the full body section.

Special thanks to DavidWinters for all the bug fixes he's already done, and to A-Town/NerdOfFolly and Naiva for their tireless data entry.


**SketchDaily Forums:**

ThereIsNoJustice has been setting up [some forums to use](http://boards.sketchdaily.net/). You can create sketchbook threads, post tutorials, or join in on some study sessions. Like the reference site, this is also a work in progress... so get over there and throw some ideas around if you're interested.


**IRC Bots:**

For those of you who haven't been in the chat lately, we have two bots now. 

Drawbot - has reference images and some group drawing tools. This one has been around for quite a while, but was rewritten and is more stable now.

Sudlowbot - provides notifications whenever people post to the daily theme. (Tactic's baby)

So be sure to drop by [the chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=Sketchdaily) and join the fun.



Whether or not any of this stuff sticks around will depend entirely on all of you, so take a peek and let us know what you think. All feedback is welcome.

Alternate Theme - Manatees

Mermaids, mythical half-female, half-fish creatures, have existed in seafaring cultures at least since the time of the ancient Greeks. Typically depicted as having a woman's head and torso, a fishtail instead of legs and holding a mirror and comb, mermaids live in the ocean and, according to some legends, can take on a human shape and marry mortal men. Mermaids are closely linked to sirens, another folkloric figure, part-woman, part-bird, who live on islands and sing seductive songs to lure sailors to their deaths.

Mermaid sightings by sailors, when they weren't made up, were most likely manatees, dugongs or Steller's sea cows (which became extinct by the 1760s due to over-hunting). Manatees are slow-moving aquatic mammals with human-like eyes, bulbous faces and paddle-like tails. It is likely that manatees evolved from an ancestor they share with the elephant. The three species of manatee (West Indian, West African and Amazonian) and one species of dugong belong to the Sirenia order. As adults, they're typically 10 to 12 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. They're plant-eaters, have a slow metabolism and can only survive in warm water. -The History Channel",,False,,t5_2sf6f,False,,default,True,t3_16906r,http://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/comments/16906r/january_9th_mermaids/,

Today is a special day, because today... we'll be having guests over from /gonewild to model for figure studies!

**Gonewilders:** (or sketchers too if you feel like it! ;D)


This is an opportunity you may or may not have always dreamed of, getting a picture of your beautiful body drawn, painted or doodled!


What we need is a picture of you, preferably a sexy full body, few clothes and an interesting pose (without head is completely fine). A fresh one is always nice but not at all necessary, take the best from your history if you want!

Sadly there's a chance we won't be able to draw everyone, so be fast!

Also, it would be awesome if you could join up in the drawing, so go find some paper and pencils and help us draw everyone!


**Sketchers:**


Sketching figures is an EXCELLENT way to improve one's knowledge of form, anatomy, light, etc. So pick as many of the awesome men and women who dare post a picture here as you can and do figure studies of them!

Take as much time as you want, a limit isn't necessary and the goal is to do create an accurate representation of the model, light, shadows, anatomy and sexiness together!


*Gonewild's rules apply in this thread, no creepy comments or insults directed at the models, also try to keep your replies limited to the drawings instead of commenting on the models.*

We've been discussing the results on irc and in modmail, but wanted to share it with all of you as well.

[So, here are the responses!](http://imgur.com/a/uG7X5)

**What does all this mean?**

* We've changed the flair. It now shows two numbers:

1. Your current streak

2. The total number of themes you've submitted a link to (still considering changing this to the number of total posts, which I think might encourage people to post comments/critiques more. Will leave as is for a little while though)

The color scheme for the flair has also been reworked so it's more of [a progression](http://i.imgur.com/Vlq0KYh.png) rather than randomly changing colors. Thanks to JTxt for the idea.


* Most people seemed happy with when themes are being posted now, but quite a few people still want it earlier. The all mighty davidwinters has rescheduled it to post at 3am cst now (2 hours earlier than before).


* We're going to start either combining or alternating serious saturdays and still life sundays. This might start next month as we've already got a bunch scheduled.

* We haven't fully decided what to do with contests yet. I think the plan is to leave it in /r/artbattle for now, but do a better job of advertising the current contest here as well.

**Other stuff, not super related to the survey:**

* Donkeyitis day was a success. We're going to try moving to a randomly selected artist of the month kind of thing next month... so watch out for that!

* I've added another tag: \[\](/nostreak). Including this in your comment will cause it to be ignored by the streak counter. You're welcome to use it or ignore it... we're not going to be policing it or anything. It looks like this: [](/nostreak)

* [This](http://stats.sketchdaily.net/) exists now and is updated daily. We'll be adding more stuff to it eventually, but it seems like a lower priority than our other plans right now.

**I also wanted to respond to a few of the comments that came in:**

&gt; Is there a way to show previews of the linked images directly in the thread?

Maybe not exactly what you're asking for, but if you're not using the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) you should really look into it. It adds a whole bunch of great stuff, including a ""view images"" tab which puts all the images right in the post. I really can't recommend this enough.

&gt; I honestly have no clue how you guys keep the place running so smoothly. I can't even recall the last time I saw a nasty comment. Great community.

It's actually pretty amazing how little we have to do. The community is so great that I don't think I've ever had to remove a comment except for the occasional spam. So thanks to all of you for being awesome.

&gt; I don't know what these things are: Flockdraw replacement &amp; reference site.

If you haven't checked it out, be sure to read the sidebar. [The reference site](http://reference.sketchdaily.net/) was put together after a few similar sites kicked the bucket, and [flockdraw](http://flockdraw.com/4lv9bn) is a group drawing things. DavidWinters has been working on a replacement which has pressure sensitivity, [and will have all sorts of other neat stuff!](https://trello.com/b/bvCVRqF6/hip-drawing-app)


**And a couple from the reference site feedback:**

A lot of the ideas that were sent in are on [the to do list](https://trello.com/b/vynO3KO3/reference-site), so it's nice to know we're on the right track.

&gt; Last I checked there were still no animals.

We still don't have too many, but we're up to 238 now. I've got a few hundred more that are ready to be uploaded and tagged, just haven't had the time yet. Hopefully soon! 

    
     

&gt; better mobile support

I'd love to hear more on this if any of you mobile people have been having issues with it. I made a little change not too long ago which should have fixed the header controls when drawing an image, but if there's more that you'd like to see done (or if that didn't work) let me know and I can look into it.

&gt; It might just be my computer, but it's been a bit spotty. Many times it just gives me an error followed by a string of code....

We've recently added something that will keep track of errors like this. If it's giving you trouble send me a PM or message me in the chat and I'll see what I can do.

Don't forget to take a look at the [reference site help wanted page](http://reference.sketchdaily.net/help) if you've got some free time!

---

I'm going to stop there. If I didn't address something you'd like to hear more about you're welcome to ask below, drop by IRC, or talk loudly in my general direction.

Here are 2 sites with tools for gesture drawing:

[Artsy Poses](http://www.artsyposes.com/models)

[Pixelovely](http://www.pixelovely.com/gesture/figuredrawing.php)

From the last time we did this:

&gt;Go there, choose 2 min (or shorter if you're hardcore) and do as many studies as you want
The point is first of all to get the flow of the pose down correctly and second of all get the proportions right, it doesn't have to be very pretty. Prefered medium is pen, graphite or charcoal on paper (also, keep that eraser away from you), if that's not possible for you then digital also works, but it can be harder depending on how familiar you are with it. This is serious practice stuff and it's great if you do it all on your own whenever you're bored too, gives you great understanding of anatomy and posing.

I suggest that today we do that. Maybe you have something you want to share, but just can't find the right words for it, so draw it.

If you haven't ever checked out CGhub, do so. You are in for some major eye candy!


So today, we will be doing some character design and **Redesigning The Oracle**. A brief description on who The Oracle is:


**Personality**: Once a human, the Oracle has ascended beyond the boundaries of mortality. It can see the past, present, and future, but always exacts a terrible toll from anyone who wants to know its secrets. It takes itself, and its job, very seriously.



**Characteristics/Traits**: An Ascended being, the Oracle is akin to a demigod more than anything. Thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of years of immortality have twisted it into a creature that only vaguely resembles its humanoid origins.

Here is [the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Vr3yQYWQ).

Here are the lyrics:

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed

With a word she can get what she came for

Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven


There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure

'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder

Ooh, it makes me wonder


There's a feeling I get when I look to the west

And my spirit is crying for leaving

In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees

And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder

Ooh, it really makes me wonder


And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune

Then the piper will lead us to reason

And a new day will dawn for those who stand long

And the forests will echo with laughter


If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now

It's just a spring clean for the May queen

Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run

There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder


Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know

The piper's calling you to join him

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?


And as we wind on down the road

Our shadows taller than our soul

There walks a lady we all know

Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold


And if you listen very hard

The tune will come to you at last

When all are one and one is all, yeah

To be a rock and not to roll


And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Unfortunately surveymonkey only lets you see the first 100 answers on free surveys, so we lost a few and didn't get to leave it up as long as intended... in the future we'll find somewhere else to host the survey. 

A few of the things I've gotten from the results:

* I was surprised that so many people didn't care when themes are posted. I think it's still for the best that themes are posted ASAP, but it's nice to know you aren't plotting to blow up our cars when we sleep in.

* If the theme (during a theme week or otherwise) is really specific we should have an alternate theme for people to do.

* Most people are happy with Freedraw Fridays as they are now, and including an optional theme seems to be the way to go.

* Lots of people are interested in doing some more serious drawing exercises. Every saturday might be a bit much, but we can try to work it in every once in a while.

* Lots of people are interested in critiques, but not everyone wants it. I guess the solution for this for now is if you want a critique, just ask for it.

Thanks again to everyone who took the time to do the survey and all the great feedback! If you're one of the unlucky 5 people who were the last to fill it out and your results were lost I'm sorry! Feel free to post your comments here or message the mods.

First off THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for subscribing to /r/sketchdaily. I can’t believe it’s been less than 2 months and we have 500 subscribers! Mutki had a great idea, and I’m so glad I jumped on board in the early stages, it’s been great fun and now it’s time to give back to some of our loyal sketchers. 
We realize sketchdaily is still in it’s infancy but what better way to put us into the next level with a fun contest! 

*The Challenge:*

CREATE AN ORIGINAL CHARACTER and show that character during 4 stages of their life. 

Ideally it would be Child/Teen/Adult/Old Age 

But this character does not have to be human, and if your character goes through different life stages than so be it!


**RULES:**

* All contestants must create an ORIGINAL work. It can be both traditional or digital art. 

* Contestants may submit their entries in the comments section of this post starting now May 26th, 2011 and the submission period will end 5 days from now on May 31st at 11:59pm GST. 

* We will have 2 extra days for voting so later submissions have a fair shot at winning. After June 2nd the winner will be determined.

* You can upvote any sketch you want to win, and as many as you’d like (although upvoting every sketch will be moot so try not to do that)

* Submit (up to 3) entries however if more than one of the same submitters entries gets highest number of votes I will choose the submission with most votes and only count that (however you will get a SPECIAL bonus prize for doing such an amazing job)

* DO NOT DOWNVOTE! I trust you all to play fair and only upvote the submissions you like and leave the ones you don’t care for alone. 



**THE PRIZE!**

I’m so happy to announce that artist [Kari Fry](http://karifry.com/) is helping us with QUITE the awesome prize!

* **FIRST PLACE:** [A Caricature](http://i.imgur.com/W7MaC.jpg) by Miss Kari herself of the winner (or whoever the winner wants) and a choice of anything from the [reddit store](http://store.xkcd.com/reddit/) (thats under $25.00) or from Kari’s [redbubble store](http://www.redbubble.com/people/misskari) 


* **SECOND PLACE:** [Reddit Combo Pack from StikkitNow](http://www.stikkitnow.com/product/reddit-combo-pack) AND Create a theme of the day for /r/SketchDaily

What could be a better way to celebrate Midsummer than **Zombies**? Therefore, the daily sketch for today (and this weekend) is to *draw something Zombie related.*

You came here interested in the contest part? Great! Keep on reading. I have one Alpha code to really promising indie game [Project Zomboid](http://projectzomboid.com/blog/) and I thought that it would be fun to give it out as a prize.

On sunday, we'll see which of the Zombie related artworks here has received most upvotes and I will award the submitter with the game.

We'll announce the top three and they will maybe get some treats and special prizes so awesome that my mind can't even come up with them yet.

If you have any questions, please ask.

Rules:

Draw, one submission per user, don't downvote, submit before sunday. Simple and clear.

Now, go on and draw those undead creeps! And most of all - have fun and sunny Midsummer!

EDIT: Here's[ my zombie Jonathan](http://i.imgur.com/IQ9QV.png). I'm of course not taking part in this playful little contest. I'm still waiting for more submissions!
