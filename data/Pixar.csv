http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THhRSJC5FX8

I was thinking this is one of the cleverest teaser's I've ever seen. It nails the awful, clich√©d college recruitment materials to a tee. Then I realized that only resonates with me so well because I am in college currently, and not long ago I was inundated with these things.

Funny how that worked out, I thought.

I looked it up, Monsters, Inc. came out in 2001. I was eight when I first saw it. I was the target demo. That was about 12 years ago. Bit of a long time to wait for a follow up, in this case a prequel. And even still, it could have worked as a tenth anniversary deal...pretty arbitrary amount of time to wait on a film they've apparently had plans to make since 2005.

Then I realized it was all on purpose. All the kids who saw Monsters, Inc. in the theaters are either in college or will be going to college soon. That teaser won't make much sense to children. They are still targeting us.

And at that I was far too impressed and flattered by the whole thing to finish my paper and decided to see what Reddit thinks about that.",,False,self,t5_2r2w3,False,,,True,t3_1a9swj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/1a9swj/i_just_realized_that_pixar_waited_for_the_kids/,

What can you reveal about *The Inside Out*, better known as *The Untitled Pixar Movie That Takes You Inside the Mind*?

What about *The Good Dinosaur*?

Do you think *Monsters University* will live up to *Monsters, Inc.*?

There has been a lot of talk about *Toy Story 4*. What do you have to say about these rumors, and are they true?

There is an empty slot for a film in November of 2015, will you announce the film for this slot?

November 2015 is also the 20 year anniversary of Toy Story. In fact, the specific date for this untitled film is November 25, 2015, just 3 days after the original was released. Coincidence?

Would you rather fight 100 Flik sized Sulleys, or 1 Sulley sized Flik?

What's your favorite movie?

What's your favorite Pixar movie?

What are your thoughts on how *Cars 2* was received by critics?

Have you guys at Pixar ever thought about doing a PG-13 movie?

What about something nobody expects, like a horror film, or a Pixar remake of the Bible?

What other films have you guys thought about making sequels for?

What was the worst thing to ever happen to you while making a film?

What about the best? Weirdest? Funniest?

Will there be a sequel to *The Pixar Story*?

Will you tell everyone at Pixar that I love them and hope to work there someday?

Will you ever do another AMA? Will the rest of the staff do an AMA?

(xpost r/movies),demusdesign,32,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/1b2et8/why_the_ending_of_toy_story_3_is_absolutely/,"I shared this on a thread last week at r/movies and thought this crowd may enjoy it too:

Watched TS3 again recently and realized how everything in the end of the whole story is absolutely perfect.

After reading their [22 rules of storytelling](http://laughingsquid.com/22-rules-of-storytelling-by-a-pixar-storyboard-artist/), I go back to nos. 6 and 7:

&gt;What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
&gt;Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

After 15 years, the writers knew well how toys think. Following these two rules above, I can picture them thinking: ""We love these characters. We want to create the best possible story, to pull out all the stops, to make it so we can say and do absolutely everything for them that can be said or done, to create the most complete and satisfying end so that we can be happy to close the story. So... what is the worst possible final scenario for a toy? What is the best? How can we take them from the worst to the best and finish this story once and for all.""

And they did. What is the worst possible ending for a toy? Worse than ending up in the hands of the masochistic kid next door? Worse than retiring into a museum for eternity? Worse than being tortured by toddlers? What is hell for a toy? How about being burned in a massive incinerator as an abandoned and unloved toy... Yeah, that'll do...

How about the best possible ending... What is better than sitting in the attic of the boy you love? What is better than going with him to college as a keepsake: around but never actually played with? What is better than retiring to a daycare where you get played with, but the children don't know you or remember you? How about being given a new life, resetting the clock, and being passed from one beloved owner to a little girl who still has a decade to play with you, pretend with you and love you... Yeah, that'll do too...

Now, to top it all off, to make this transition as sublime for our beloved toys as we can, we'll have Andy take out one whole afternoon from his busy college-bound schedule to introduce them to this girl. Then he'll give them the perfect send off... the thing these toys have wanted more than anything for the years they've been waiting in his toy box... he'll play with them... one. last. time. And then he will say good bye. And then they will be Bonnie's. And they will be played with and loved every day all over again... Yeah, that'll do...

Damn, I get emotional just thinking about it again. Absolutely. Perfect.

1341085994.0,23,self.Pixar,vupfv,I need your help! I HAVE to write a letter to Pixar. I just watched Brave... and I have this burning need to let them know how this movie made me feel... does anyone know their address? (more inside. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS),Pudgekip,29,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/vupfv/i_need_your_help_i_have_to_write_a_letter_to/,"**Please do no read the following if you do not want spoilers, you've been warned**

I went to see Brave with my mother (and one of her friends and their 6 year old daughter and son). My impression of the movie was that it was about a rebellious young girl who's mother was a bit controlling and that she was just going out into the world to become more independent. I figured it would be the perfect movie to watch with my mother, given that she and I have a can at times have straind relationship, since we ever see things eye to eye. I thought this would be a great mom to say ""hey mom, let me go kthx"" (I'm 21 btw)


Well, of you've watched the movie, you know it's a bit different then that.

I was trying my hardest not to break down in the part where little Merida is sitting with her mother. Because I remember a time when I was little and I was that close with her. No fighting, no attitudes, no pride. Just hugs and kisses and I love yous...

 I looked over a few seats (My mother and her friend were sitting together and I was sitting on the other end of everyone next to her kids) and she was crying.

God damn it.

A few things I should point out:

* I've never been really good at talking on an emotional level with my mother, or anyone for that matter.

* I was a tomboy-ish rebellious teen, and I've kept that attitude forever.


* My hair is always unkept, and I like it that way, wavie and crazy.

* I've always been goofy and not very proper  (for example: I love to make faces in family pictures)

* I love archery.

* I tend to not listen to my mom. I love her dearly, but I just sometimes don't want to listen.

* Finally, the night before watching the movie, my mom and I had a huge fight.


I know the movie itself hasn't gotten many *awesome* reviews, but to me it has been one of the most intimate things I've ever shared with my mother. It fit our relationship perfectly. It was absolutely fantastic... so much so that I want to buy a copy of it when it comes out and give it to her.


The end had me crying, and all I wanted to do was get up and go hug my mother... but I didn't out of pride. Which made me cry even more. It was ridiculous. I looked over and she was crying too... saodjfsdflkj.


So when it finished... we're leaving the theatre and I'm up ahead (trying to dry my tears), and I wait for my mom and she comes up to me and says ""She reminded me so much of you, her rebellious attitude, her hair, even the archery."" and she said this while she had tears in her eyes.... and I just couldn't hold it and we cried and hugged and stuff. I just didn't say anything... cause I've never been able to. I hope she knew what I was feeling though. ;-; I'm sure she did... shes my mom after all...

I'm sure we looked like two crazy ladies, even her friend was looking at us awkwardly... but I feel people wont really *feel* what the movie was trying to convey unless they've been in that situation. Something my mother and I have been in since I can remember.

My mom has always been there for me. She's always been kind and loving and caring... it's just I have a bit of an attitude problem... which, since watching Brave, I am working hard on changing.

This movie really left an impression in me, something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I'm so lucky to have my mother. qq...

There's so much more I want to say... but I want to say it to Pixar and the people who worked on Brave. Please please help me.

Don't get me wrong, i will see Brave and i have nothing against Dream Works, it's Just that it doesn't really fall into the usual Pixar atmosphere. There aren't any talking toys, cars, or other inanimate objects, the main character isn't an animal or a monster. I know Up and The Incredibles had main characters who were ""humans"" but The Incredibles were superheroes, and many of the major characters in Up were talking dogs. Brave, however, is about a tomboy princess, which, to me, seems to fall more into the Disney category rather than the Pixar category.
tl; dr Brave doesn't look like an instant classic Pixar movie.

Does anyone else feel this way?

Edit: i went to see it and it was very Pixary. Although it was not anything super original and outlandish it did have magic and legends and was just as hilarious and heartwarming as the Pixar movies that we have come to love.

This may be the wrong group to be posting in as, presumably, we're a bit biased.

However, I was a bit surprised in reading reviews of the film as they nearly all seemed to claim that the movie was too safe.

Of course the movie was a prequel, so how much new ground could truly be tread? But I actually thought the tone and characterization in the movie was incredibly strong and that Pixar actually went to some lengths to make sure that the movie didn't end on a note that was too safe.

To me, the movie could have ended in a safe manner if:

* It had ended when OK won the Scare Contest
* It had ended with the Dean allowing Mike &amp; Sully in after the camp scene
* It had ended with Mike &amp; Sully getting scare jobs at Monsters Inc right after getting kicked out of MU

But instead it went with the mail room technique.

So what do you guys thing? Was MU too safe?",,False,self,t5_2r2w3,False,,,True,t3_1hc9ci,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/1hc9ci/was_monsters_university_too_safe/,

My thought is that Rio (though I haven't seen it) was not as memorable as their other movies like Ice Age and people are bound to forget about it sooner or later.

Was Wall-E a sentient being?

If so did he attain this sentience or was he programmed?

I personally feel it was something he attained through the years, a little bit of A.I. and a lot of time, and he developed those qualities we feel most human about himself.

I wasn't sure where to submit this, but it's something I wanted to talk about, even though it's probably been discussed here already.

I had very high expectations of Brave, because I absolutely love Pixar.  The only cartoon characters I've ever really loved were Invader Zim and Calvin and Hobbes, but Pixar just continued to create these lovable characters and original movies.  Each time they created a movie, they would start with a fresh page.  Pixar hardly ever made any sequels, and their shorts are ultra adorable.  Even as I watched the trailers and it became more and more clear what the plot of Brave was, I still held out hope because it was Pixar.  I watched the whole movie with the mentality that Pixar could do no wrong.

I hated it.  I don't think it could really be called a *bad* movie.  It's very good quality and high budget, it doesn't have any plotholes, and it's definitely not as cheesy as a lot of animation.  It just seems so mediocre and overdone.  It's about a rebellious princess whose parents want her to get married, but she wants to explore the woods and shoot things with her bow.  There are literally hundreds of movies out there that are about this.  What happened to the company that cast rats, robots, and old men as their main characters?  We don't need another rebellious teenage girl.

Anyway.  I guess I'm ranting here.  I've talked to my friends and parents about this, but they all said they loved Brave.  It seems like Pixar has such a good track record that they are almost immune to criticism.  They also seem to be making a lot of sequels to their older films (though I loved Toy Story 3 and thought it was a nice way to wrap up the Toy Story series).  I feel like Pixar is going the way of so many other successful creators by finding a formula that works and sticking with it.  Maybe I'm just imagining it, and I really hope I am.  There are very few things that I am a die- hard fan of, but Pixar has got to be in the top.  It's easy to be mad at marketing executives for cancelling your favorite show, but it's a million times worse to watch it peter out until you're only watching it out of respect.  Please tell me that isn't going to happen to Pixar, and that Monsters University is going to be an awesome movie.",,False,self,t5_2r2w3,False,,,True,t3_1awhsp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/1awhsp/this_might_be_a_little_late_but_thoughts_on_brave/,

So lets say Monsters Inc. took place the year it came out which is 2001 and lets presume that Mike and Sully are in their middle ages, like 50.  People attend college around the age of 18-22 so Monsters University takes place 30 years ago which means that Monsters University takes place in the 1970's (human years at least).  And then in the final trailer it shows Mike on a field trip to Monsters Inc.  At this time he's probably 6 or 7 so subtract another estimated 15 years and the Monsters University timeline stretches all the way back to at least 1955.

There hasn't been enough trailer footage for me to confirm this but its pretty self explanatory one you look at it.  It just kinda bothers me how some of the objects in the trailers (not counting the facilities themselves) don't look very period.  Again this may be done with the movie comes out but this is just what I noticed.

EDIT: As I was lying in bed I thought to myself ""If they're in their 50's then why is Mike dating Celia, whom herself seems to be very young.""  I've also noticed that both Mike and Sulley are roommates who live in a small, little furnished city apartment with one car.  These all are attributes of a recent college graduate.  So I've reworked my argument to say that Mike and Sulley are in their late 20's to early 30's.  Subtracts 10 years from when they first entered college and that brings us to 1991. Subtract another 15 from Mike's first Monster's Inc. orientation and that brings us to 1976 which makes a lick more sense than 1955.

And as WasabiSeventeen pointed out what I mean by period technology are certain vehicles, appliances, devices, and anything else of that sort.  Most of the things in the monster world have that teeth design on most appliances but they should look like they're at least from the 90's or early 2000's.  They won't look human, but at least similar.  Monsters Inc. and Monsters University themselves should look virtually unchanged from whenever they were first built because in real life old factories and old universities don't get modern day refurbishments very often.",,False,self,t5_2r2w3,1370250921.0,,,True,t3_1fkirf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/1fkirf/my_monsters_university_timeline_analysis/,

I just started college at the University of Central Florida, working on my BFA in Emerging Media - Character Animation. I finally start art classes next semester, but probably won't start any animating classes for another year or two. I've heard from many people my drawing skills need to go from good to fantastic. I've been practicing drawing everyday with different medias and different subjects. I plan to purchase some books on animation and anatomy soon. What books do you suggest? What subjects do you suggest I draw?

After I receive my BFA, I plan to move to California and get my MFA and get an internship. I've noticed a few colleges that offer an MFA in animation, including CalArts. What exactly is Experimental Animation? How would a BFA in character and a MFA in experimental benefit me? Do you know any schools I really should look into?

What are some free animation programs I can download that will help me get an idea of how to animate? I have no clue how to work any programs and would like a program that will get me started.

*dated*",frkmstr509,7,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/uzdfv/john_carter_pixars_lost_epic_dated/,"I don't know how many know the production story behind John Carter (of  Mars), but this film was originally meant to be Pixar's first live action film.  Rich Ross, Disney's then CEO came in with a television background green-lighting one of the highest budgeted films of all time, exceeding $250 mil.  This was done all the while he reduced the budget to Depp's ""The Lone Ranger"", and halting 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  Now, months later, John Carter ultimately made its' money back with a small single digit millions in profit.  Ross was known for blaming Pixar who pulled themselves from the project and alienated themselves from Ross allowing Disney's animation/digital company to take control of the project.  

Do any of you think that because the production name ""Pixar"" was withdrawn from what was then known as John Carter of Mars, led to the box office flop? Pixar has a library that almost bursts perfection *cars 2 exception*, but nonetheless has been one of, if not the top grossing CGI production companies of the past decade and a half.

I personally think with a title like, ""Pixar's: John Carter of Mars"" is much more interesting and inviting to the viewer.  But all is said and done. However, video sales are rising surprisingly, hopefully leading way to a sequel/continuation to the character based on multiple novels.

So where is the box set made into a lunchbox? I have literally held off from buying a single one of these Pixar films because I am waiting for this set to release. It just seems so patently obvious, do the following:

- Bundle everything from Toy Story to Toy Story 3 (the obvious wrap up for the epoch)
- Include sketches and concept art
- Assemble a few clips and documentaries
- Remaster whatever is needed for HD release
- Put it in Wall-E's lunchbox

1320039575.0,1,self.Pixar,luvjw,So i got bored one night and wrote a story... this is how it turned out... tell me what you think. [xpost from self],AV3R4G3_J03,1,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/luvjw/so_i_got_bored_one_night_and_wrote_a_story_this/," This is my story about a penguin named Lost. Lost felt he was more than just a penguin. He knew he was meant for bigger things. So he took off on the adventure of a lifetime. Now, I‚Äôd like to lie to you and tell you his journey was easy, but i can‚Äôt, this isn‚Äôt some buddy the elf magically has enough ice to make it to new york type of trip, this is the real deal.
Lost, being a Gentoo penguin, thought he had a good sense of direction so he knew to head north northwest. Unfortunately, the ocean is huge and he had no view of land in any direction except back. But he kept swimming the direction he thought was right. He swam for almost ten straight days, taking various breaks of course. Until one day ten he saw a little speck of land off in the distance this only made him swim faster in hopes of getting to America as fast as possible. So he swam and swam till he finally made it to the beautiful beaches... he was there and not a minute to soon because here comes the night once again so he grabbed a fish and found shelter under a fallen cactus for the night
Lost used the next day to collect his thoughts‚Ä¶ He looked around... Everything pointed to him being in Florida; beaches, smooth rocks, a cactus... A CACTUS!? WHAT? That‚Äôs not right ... it was only then that he saw that pesky kangaroo jumping by... HE WAS IN AUSTRALIA! How could this have happened he could have sworn he was going the right direction! This news made Lost upset to the verge of giving up... so he sat ... and did nothing.... all day.
Day 11 was about the same... still depressed still sitting ... a little less hope a little more hunger.
Day 12, his head was spinning the hunger was getting to him and it was time to wake up and make the best of a bad situation... he had seen tons of kangaroos headed away from the beach ... they had to eat too! there must be food somewhere. So he followed the path of the kangaroos towards the middle of the island, this god forsaken island.
He traveled all of day 12 and 13 looking for food... finding a bug here or there, or under a rock, or on a log, or in a pond, or in the open, or flying around his head, There were a lot of bugs.... he wasn‚Äôt too hungry any more actually
As night past once again day 14 came. He saw a building in the distant he couldn‚Äôt believe it, he had made it to Sydney! he was wondering around noticing how people responded to seeing a penguin when he came across a mail box that caught his eye ‚Äú42 W. Way‚Äù‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt know why but it caught his attention. also there was a map of Sydney in the mailbox. Perfect he thought. I‚Äôll just mark this place as a reference. he soon went on his way till he wondered into a land fill. it was getting dark so he found shelter in an old fridge and drifted to sleep.
he woke up on the morning of day 15 and as he was looking around he realized that there were tons of fridges near him and he wanted to make sure if he ever came back that he slept in the same fridge so he picked up a small plant with its dirt and put it in the fridge and shut the door. As he was walking out of the dump he noticed a pile of old dusty books, there were 2 that caught his eye; a cook book and a book on the circus. He grabbed a cloth and wrapped up his 2 books his map and what appeared to be a brand new astronaut toy and put a stick through. He started walking again but it didn‚Äôt last long Because he ran into a group of bugs who had never seen a penguin before. They thought of him as a god, they wanted a ""bible"" to teach them how to live. He was kind of in a hurry so he just gave them the circus book and went on his way.  He wondered through the city aimlessly for a little longer till he saw a pelican who appeared to be ‚Äúlost‚Äù he gave him the map he had found to make sure he found his way to where ever he was going. He spent the rest of the day thinking about how far from home he had wondered
He had ended up in a box just outside of a mall on the morning of day 16. He was awoken by a helpless mom on the phone freaking out about some kind of Christmas gift or something. she sounded so sad and it really got to Lost. He felt bad, so while she wasn‚Äôt looking he snuck up and placed the toy from earlier in her purse, he figured she would need it more than he did. Now back to the task at hand, yesterday he saw an airport and since he wanted to make it to the states and didn‚Äôt want to swim he figured flying would be the easiest way to do so. he wondered around looking for the landmarks that he had made a mental note of, but it took him longer than he thought and he was growing weary ... until finally he saw the blue blimp balloon floating above the airport. He snuck into an employee entrance and headed straight for bag checking. Weaving through people until he made it to one of the lines, he snuck into one of the flyers bags. He only zipped it up part way as he felt himself get lifted onto a conveyor belt. As he looked around he saw a crumpled piece of paper with some sort of design on it... he didn‚Äôt know what it was though. and he drifted off to sleep once again.
 As he woke up on day 17 he knew he was in the bottom of the plane and he had to get out of the cramped bag. As he was exiting, he noticed bottle cap stuck to the outside of the bag. He grabbed it before he had a look around.
He was looking for something that could get him off the plane when he lands. ""squeak"" what was that he thought? Squeak there it was again, must be a mouse‚Ä¶ or a MONSTER! No, no it‚Äôs a mouse; it has to be... monsters don‚Äôt have passports. And sure enough, up walked a mouse trying to get his life together.... Lost suggested a hobby to keep him occupied and the mouse thought that was smart. but what hobby? Lost quickly opened his parcel and held up the cook book that he had picked up earlier at the dump! PERFECT! Try this he said as he handed the mouse the book and went on his way. He really just needed to find a glider of some sort. To fly off the plane, but that would be too perfect. It was just then that he felt the plane begin to descend. They must be close he thought as he noticed a hatch by the wheel of the plane. He waited there till the plane landed, jumped out and ducked into a dark corner until morning
he slept uneasily that night so he was still tired on day 18 but he was planning on pushing through... but there was one problem, he didn‚Äôt know where the plane landed... what state was he in!? there was no way to tell for sure which direction to head and that was bad, it discouraged him so he sat... and sat.... and sat... and slept.
day 19 went better, he just decided to wonder... wondering works... usually.... but as he was leaving his small corner he noticed few papers flying around.... he managed to grab 2 of them... one said ""NEVER BE AFRAID"" and the other was a motivational speech talking about winning a race of some sort... he would read that later. He kept them with him for now. He wandered around until he saw a big sign on the side of a mountain that read HOLLYWOOD. That was it! He knew where he was! So he walked ... he walked ... he waddled until he saw a small girl crying, So he went up to her and found out that her balloon had just popped and she was super upset. It was apparently her lucky balloon and she wanted to keep it forever... Lost asked if she wanted something else that could be lucky and would last much longer than a balloon? She obviously did, so he opened he sack and handed her the bottle cap he grabbed from the plane. she was very pleases and lost went on his way Feeling happy. But it was becoming dark so he had to find a place to sleep when he noticed a red car sitting on the side of the road. So he hopped in and read the motivational speech to put him to sleep.
He woke suddenly on day 20 with the rev of the engine and quickly jumped out of the car ... not seeing who was driving. Unfortunately he forgot his reading materiel (the speech) he figured he could do without it. So he wondered on when something shiny caught his eye in the mud. after a small cleaning job he found that it was a wedding ring ... ‚Äúa wedding ring?‚Äù He thought ‚ÄúWhat am i going to do with a wedding ring?‚Äù so he snuck up behind this big muscular dude and stuck it into his pocket. Hoping it would make him happy in the future. It felt good, doing a good deed, looking back he had done a good deed here and there but none as big as giving away a wedding ring. So after a short celebration he wandered on. Until it got dark and he fell asleep in yet another box.
He woke on the 21st day thinking that he needed to stop sleeping in boxes; his neck hurt and his foot was asleep.  But he pushed through, once again, until he saw a girl on the side of the road selling lemonade,  She was really small... like ... she shouldn‚Äôt be out by herself but she was and Lost was thirsty. She gladly poured him a glass and said it was on the house, but lost felt bad so he gave her the note that said ""NEVER BE AFRAID"" he felt it a fair trade and walked on. 
After a quick sleep day 22 arose. that‚Äôs when i saw him, picked him up, fed him, and asked him what he was doing in the states. He explained to me that he felt he was meant for something bigger, bigger than him and I... bigger than everyone.  he explained his whole story to me down to the last detail. i just laughed and told him he had done more than he could have ever imagined more than anyone else knows. 
you‚Äôve done so much
You gave ratatouille his first cook book
you gave Andy‚Äôs mom his buzz light-year toy
your responsible for the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. incredible
you gave lightning McQueen the motivation to win a piston cup
you gave boo the courage to not be scared of monsters
you mapped out where marlin could find the dentist 
you gave Ellie her grape soda badge 
you preserved life in a fridge for eve to find
and you gave the circus bugs the reason they are in the circus  
You are literally the reason for the existence of all the Pixar movies...

Forgive me if this is generally known, but I haven‚Äôt seen it observed elsewhere. The other day I decided to watch The Iron Giant for the first time in many years, this time as a Brad Bird enthusiast. I couldn't help but notice this one shot of Hogarth's home, and its apparent similarities to Carl and Ellie's house in Up: both have two main, triangular wings perpendicular to each other; both have a fenced porch with stairs up to the front door on the left and a protruding window on the right; the front right of both houses protrudes slightly; and both, in these shots at least, share a similar pastel colour scheme, though in the shot of The Iron Giant on the left this is a result of the scene being lit by sunset rather than the actual colour of the house. 

Obviously the houses vary in a number of ways, from chimney placement to the number of second floor windows, but knowing of Brad‚Äôs work at Pixar and of Pixar‚Äôs general fondness for self-referential flourishes, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if the famous Up house owes a deliberate nod to The Iron Giant.",,False,self,t5_2r2w3,1343307539.0,,,True,t3_x6qow,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/x6qow/the_house_from_up_is_in_the_iron_giant/,

I really do.  But here are a few things I do not believe:

-- That Earth is ravaged by fierce daily sandstorms... but somehow the tall, skinny, free-standing piles of garbage stacked up by Wall-e never get blown over.

-- That Buy 'n' Large would use tiny little Wall-e trash bots to clean up the entire planet, while using gigantic Wall-a trash bots to clean up a single spaceship.

-- That all of Earth could be covered in trash.  Earth is pretty big in terms of surface area.  You could probably dump trash in just the Grand Canyon and not fill it for a few milennia at least.

-- That a probe robot sent to inspect Earth for signs of life would have a ridiculously powerful laser death blaster it uses to instantly blow up anything that might be alive.

-- That a spaceship sending a probe to Earth would have the delivery rocket make two round trips, instead of waiting on Earth until the probe is ready to return.

-- That a probe would have to bring back a physical specimen of life before Earth is deemed safe, instead of just transmitting back the data from scanning the specimen.

-- That a civilization incapable of living sustainably on an entire planet could do so in the confined quarters of a spaceship.
