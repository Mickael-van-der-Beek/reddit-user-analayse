His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it.

...Very very few people realize that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded.

So yes, it took less than a full day (I started at 8PM Wednesday night and finished at 12PM Thursday) but I've just finished reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and loved every bit of it. I don't think I had ever found a book to be so fulfilling. It was the kind of book where I would be reading it, then after a few minutes, realize that my face was hurting because I had the dumbest grin of my face, correct my expression, then go back to reading only to realize minutes later that my face had yet again contorted into another odd smile. I would finish a section and walk away for a bit. My mind would naturally drift back to the pages I had just read and I would be unable to do anything but smile. It was nice not having many people around because I'm pretty sure I looked like a serial killer grinning randomly at air.

I do feel a bit bad about how I plowed through it, though I have at least 4 other books to follow it up that I can take my time on, though I predict I will probably be unable to restrain myself that much. I know books 4 and 5 weren't as warmly received though I can't imagine I won't read them at this point.

I'll go first,Eparetad,52,9,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/DontPanic/comments/1895di/share_your_own_hitchhiker_story_ill_go_first/,"I first picked up a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when I was 12. I was browsing the school's library looking through all the books (Most of which completely bored me. It was a middle school in Alabama)

I decided to ask the librarian if there were any stories that took characters to space. She showed me a few titles I no longer remember and she could see they were a little too childish for me. So then she said ""Have you ever read anything by Douglas Adams? I bet his books will be right up your ally"" and smiled. She was right! I fell in love right away. I couldn't put it down.

I read during classes, I read at home... then, since my parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and they didn't allow me to read anything that wasn't approved by them first, they were furious. They tossed the book across the room and took it back to the librarian the next day and they took me with and had my library account deactivated. I was only to read books that were required by the school for classes and that was it. The librarian was horrified and she finally understood a lot about me without anything more having to be said.

Well, there was a loophole... my parents didn't allow me to celebrate holidays and stuff like that... so, I'd always get excused from class and go to the library whenever we would do holiday/school pride related things in class. So, while I was in the library I'd read the book :) I didn't get to the other books until later that year because the lackluster library of the Alabama public school only had the first book.

However, we moved around a lot so the next place we moved to had the big anthology book :)

Hitchhiker's was the first book I read that I wasn't allowed to read that I read anyway. It started my rebellion. ",,False,,t5_2t9xb,False,,,True,t3_1895di,http://www.reddit.com/r/DontPanic/comments/1895di/share_your_own_hitchhiker_story_ill_go_first/,

I love the 5 canon books from Adams. Frankly, I've just never been able to convince myself to read And Another Thing. Yes, I've heard lots of people say that it's a very good impersonation of Adams and does a good job continuing the story. Yes, I know that it was generally well-received.

But for some reason, that's just not enough for me. Something about the concept seems a little off. Sure, I wish Adams had lived another three decades and pumped out a couple more HHGTTG books. But he didn't and I feel like the legacy needs to be left intact.

Change my mind, Reddit. Should I break down and read it?

**Edit:** OK, you all crack me up. I read through all of the comments so far. And currently there are seven ""yes, read it"" votes, seven ""no, don't read it"" votes, and three that are pretty ambivalent.

FINAL EDIT: I am making these available through my place of work. We're a glass studio that has been in business for over 30 years. We run a stained glass and a cabinet glass business. Here are our websites in case you want to make sure we're legit.

www.studiojglass.com 

www.arcglasseffects.com

Please contact us by phone at 973-569-0200 to order. I've informed the sales staff to look out for these orders. Just ask for the Don't Panic decals or the Hitchhiker's Guide decals. 

$5 per decal. My boss wanted me to charge $1 for shipping, but I've decided to cover that personally to help spread some Douglas Adams goodness.

Once your decals arrive, [use the method in this youtube video to apply your decal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKRVwYZcnA)

People liked the [one that I made for my wife.](http://i.imgur.com/K415s3m.jpg)

I talked to my boss (I made the decal on work equipment) and if I wanted to make more for redditors, the shop would sell them for $5 each.

As far as I can tell, they're the same as [the ones here.](http://thedecalguru.com/dont-panic-car-decal) Good for kindle, ipad, cars, etc.

Edit: if there's interest in this, I would take a vector drawing of this pattern as payment for the decal. That way, everyone would get the highest quality decal. 

Edit 2: I'm going to work on perfecting the design, and I'll PM anyone who was interested once I get it.

Edit 3: Things are looking good. I'm a bit busy with my normal work stuff, but I should be able to produce a bunch of these by tomorrow and I'll contact people then. The one I made for the Kindle was approx. 4 inches by 6 inches. I'll make that the standard size, but I'll also make them available smaller for stuff like car decals.

Edit 4: I have a bunch mostly done, but I'm leaving work soon. [Here's the new version using a vector image that made the lines perfect.](http://i.imgur.com/KJEGbU1.jpg) I'll contact people tomorrow and start mailing these out.

Congratulations on being such a seriously hoopy frood. Seriously. I bet you always know where your towel is. If you don't know where your towel is can I suggest you look under you as that's where I tend to find mine after a couple too many Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters (more than zero.)


Anyway, due to a strange time interference between when a friend of mine said he would be in London and when he is actually going to be in London I have two amazing seats to [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Show](http://www.hitchhikerslive.com) to sell. The show features all the living members of the original radio show, is directed by Dirk Maggs - the man Douglas Adams wanted to complete his vision - and promises lots of special guests from people involved in h2g2 across the course of its life.


The show starts at 7.30pm on the 10th July 2012 at the [Aylsebury Waterside](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;gs_upl=153371l153371l0l153604l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=aylesbury+waterside+theatre&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=uk&amp;hq=aylesbury+waterside+theatre&amp;cid=0,0,5361786504117461594&amp;ei=wRD_TvgplL7yA6K52JIL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CBsQ_BI) (30-60 mins north of London, easily accessible by train) and these are some incredible seats, third row centre, so you'll be right in the action.


I'm hoping to sell the tickets so I can buy another pair for a night when my friend really is in London and, because it's you reddit, all I'm asking for is £53, the cost of the tickets, and then I'll post them out to you for free! Because I love you.

Because I was a huge fan of HHGG and my only gripe was that Douglas Adams died (so long and thanks for all the dolphins, man!) and... well, I couldn't really find any other books which had that style and type of humor and his level of comedy brilliance.

Has anyone found anything else?

Has anyone tried to make something like that? Whether a story or an audio podcast? Addressing any fellow writers out there I guess.

I ask partly because I eventually decided to take a shot. But curious if anybody else is, and/or anything out there I've overlooked. Even though I've put on the writer hat recently, I still want to read HHGG-like stories. It's a hell of a lot less work reading than writing too, as a bonus, haha.

~~Anyway, due to a strange time interference between when a friend of mine said he would be in London and when he is actually going to be in London I have two amazing seats to [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Show](http://www.hitchhikerslive.com) to sell. The show features all the living members of the original radio show, is directed by Dirk Maggs - the man Douglas Adams wanted to complete his vision - and promises lots of special guests from people involved in h2g2 across the course of its life.~~

~~The show starts at 7.30pm on the 10th July 2012 at the [Aylsebury Waterside](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;gs_upl=153371l153371l0l153604l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=aylesbury+waterside+theatre&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=uk&amp;hq=aylesbury+waterside+theatre&amp;cid=0,0,5361786504117461594&amp;ei=wRD_TvgplL7yA6K52JIL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CBsQ_BI) (30-60 mins north of London, easily accessible by train) and these are some incredible seats, third row centre, so you'll be right in the action.~~

~~All I'm asking for is £53, the cost of the tickets, and then I'll post them out to you for free! Because I love you. That said I'll happily entertain other offers.~~

I liked that, rather than just imitating the older books, he carried on with the somewhat more mature and world-weary version of the cast that had evolved over the course of them.  And the plot was as totally batty as anything Adams had come up with.  (I loved the minor god interviews.)  If anything, I think the biggest problem with them was that he spent a bit too much time doing shout-outs and referencing practically every minor species mentioned by the Book in the entire rest of the series.

Oh, and another thing I like about it, just because I'm a bit anal about these things: it allows the books to be neatly split into two trilogies, each with the proper introduction-escalation/cliffhanger-resolution structure.

**Don't Panic**

Everyone is a researcher for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, except one sucker, who plays The Guide. Play in a bar, for obvious reasons.
___________________________
Researchers:

Obtain a piece of paper. 

Write your name at the top of the paper.

Right under the name, write DON'T PANIC in big friendly letters.

Researchers have 2 stats: Froodidity and Towel. Divide 12 points between the two stats.

Write down the names of the other researchers. After each name write “owes me __ drinks.” The blank starts at 0.

For any action where effectiveness, ingenuity, or style is at stake, roll 1d12+froodidity. Any result 12+ is a success.

For any action where life, limb, or other vital item is at stake, roll 1d12+towel. Any result 12+ is a success. Narrate how you use your towel to get out of trouble.

If you fail, another player can save your bacon. They roll +froodidity or +towel, as appropriate.

If they succeed, you're both safe. You now owe them a drink. They should mark this down on their sheet, so you can't weasel out of it later. If the situation was particularly dangerous, they might demand their drink right then and there. Don't flake out dude, they just saved your life.

If they fail, you both need saving. Or maybe you die.
_________________________
Guide:
Mediate the game. Play happens in 4 stages.

1. Consulting the Guide: Give the researchers a topic from the guide, and a few key facts from the topic. The researchers must test the accuracy of the facts. Make the facts outrageous, impossible, dangerous, and ridiculous.

2. Making the Plan: The researchers discus how to go about proving/disproving the facts given. Roleplay scenes about getting supplies, questioning the natives, etc. 

3. Carrying out the Plan: Set up and run the experiment, go out to the field and make observations. Make mistakes, get messy. Bring your towel.

4. Getting Drunk: Pay off any drinks owed. Discuss your findings. Decide on a new, revised guide entry. The new entry doesn't have to be accurate, or based off any real findings.

I don't want to be the ""shameless self-plug guy"" and just spam it.*

I opened a Zazzle store about a month ago with all kinds of geeky gear and one of my categories is HHGttG stuff. All my designs are original (some simple, some clever, some cryptic) and I was wondering if anyone would be interested in seeing them.

-----------------------------------

**EDIT:** I woke up to a chorus of ""HELL YEAH!"", so I'll go ahead and spill the beans. :)

**[Galactic Hitchhiker Gear at Boom!Shirts](http://www.zazzle.com/boomshirts/gifts?cg=196965217274202305)**

A couple caveats:

1) Yes, I know the pricing is a little stiff. I got locked into these prices for the time being and Zazzle doesn't institute pricing changes until the 20th of each month. So, these are the current prices, but *everything* will permanently drop in price somewhere around $1 to $5 on April 20th. So, if you want gear but are a little short on cash, wait until April 20th and everything will be a little bit more affordable.

2) If you like a design, but want it on a different product that Zazzle offers (other apparel, iPhone/iPod cases, clocks, doggie shirts, posters, whatever), let me know and I'll see about making it available.

3) I have a few more designs in the works (like DON'T PANIC iPhone and iPod cases and a more cartoony ""So Long and Thanks..."" design), but haven't finished the designs yet. I'll let everyone know when those are available if anyone is interested.

----------------------------------------

Lastly, if you notice, there is a category called ""Gear for Redditors"". What I'm doing with that is putting together custom designs for specific subreddits (mostly ones that I sub to and don't already have subreddit-specific gear). I already have a slew of designs done and available for [/r/wicked_edge](/r/wicked_edge) and am working on a few designs for other subs.

ZARNIWOOP: You didn’t notice? Well, er, I’ll let you work it out for yourself.

&gt;ZAPHOD: Er, yeah. 
&gt;ZARNIWOOP: In to my universe. 
&gt;ZAPHOD: Yeah...

- The heart of gold has been brought into the universe

But if the Heart of Gold (HoG) was brought into the universe Zaphod must have entered it within an unknown period between **exiting** the Total Perspective Vortex (TPV) and saving Arthur &amp; Ford. For at no point before the TPV does he have the HoG. 

Unless the discovery of the HoG in the alt universe is just as good to Zarniwoop, in which case he enters the alt universe somewhere in Zarniwoops office.

Mostly I'm worried about format and silly mistakes.

I'd like to apologize in advance for my extremely long post.

   I've been through so much with this amazing book. I remember back in 7th grade when I saw my friend holding his Hitchhiker's Guide and I asked him about it. I had seen the movie a couple years before, and I hated it. He did too, however. I was hesitant to read it because of my experience with the movie, but after reading one page I was hooked. I only like a handful of books, but books hold sentimental value to me so I didn't want to borrow his because of the fear of accidentally damaging it. That night, I ordered this copy online and I waited impatiently for it to arrive.
   
When it did arrive, I started reading it wherever I was. I remember bringing it to school every day and reading it during class. I had so many people ask me, ""Is that a bible?""
  
 I'd respond with, ""I guess you could say that"".
  
 My friends would have no idea what they were getting themselves into when they asked ""What is it about?"" I'm sure they had no idea they were about to get a 15 minute overview of a book that seemingly had no plot or sense whatsoever.
   
One of the classes I had was being a library helper, which basically meant I got to sit in the library for 45 minutes doing absolutely nothing. One day when I was reading, I started laughing at one of the lines I read.
   
The librarian said, ""Stop laughing.""
  
 I tried explaining, ""I can't stop laughing. This book is so funny!""
 
  She then told me in a terrible attitude, ""Then laugh in your head.""
   
I said, quite aggravated, ""Sorry, but it's pretty hard to 'laugh in your head'. This book is very funny; I'm going to keep reading it, and when I get to a part I think is quite humerous, I'm going to laugh at it.""
   
About a minute later, I remember reading the line, ""I'm so cool you could store a slab of meat in me for a month! I'm so hip I have trouble seeing past my pelvis!"" Naturally, I laughed. This made the librarian pretty mad and she gave me ISS. Yep, ISS for laughing at a book in a library.
   I'm sure you can guess what I did all day in ISS.

   
It's also quite hard to explain a funny part in the book to people. I would read a really funny line and my friend would ask what I was laughing at. I'd try to read him the line, but then I realized it wouldn't be that funny without knowing what was going on. I'd look back a bit and try to start there, but he'd need prior knowledge to understand that part as well. I'd end up reading him 7 paragraphs just to get to that one funny part I wanted to read him.
   
It's also hard to find people to talk to about this book. I've only got about 2 friends or so that have read it, or better yet, understood it. That's why I was so excited when I found this subreddit about a week ago.
   
In the past couple of years, I've seen and heard so many references to the book that I wouldn't have understood if I hadn't have read it. It was as if I'd been put into a special little cult. Every single time I see the number 42, it holds significance in my brain. this is very distracting when trying to finish math homework. 
   
I also love the subtle humor it has. Like how Arthur's house was being destroyed to make a bypass, and had he looked in the town hall, he would have seen the notice and had time to prepare. Then when the Vogons came to earth to destroy it for a bypass, they told the humans that it had been posted in Alpha Centauri for fifty years, so they had plenty of time to file a complaint. I've tried putting post-it notes on the pages that something funny happens, but I gave up because of the extreme amount of post-it notes I was going through.
   
I'm sure many of you have lost interest in my life story by now, so I'll rap it up by reciting my favourite quote:

   
""This must be Thursday,"" said Arthur to himself, sinking low over his beer. ""I never could get the hang of Thursdays.""

Not many people have read this, and I wanted to see if any of you were interested. :)

The J'ardeen are a curious race. They are one of the only four species to make itself extinct. The most famous of these species is of course the Dodo, who spent their time trying to hug the savage apes that hunted them. Many believed that if the Dodo had arms, their lovable, but stupid, nature would have turned them into pets instead of a Sunday roast. The J'ardeen went extinct not due to wanting a hug, but due to a thirst for knowledge. Before 42, the answer to life, the universe and everything, many philosophers were still trying to find out the meaning of life. The J'ardeen were a deeply philosophical species, struggling to eat without knowing whether or the not their food would have led a richer, meaningful life had it not been slowly dissolved in it's seven heeloglans. Two million years and twelve exploded brains later and a plucky young J'ardling put forward his idea. It went like this: Blarg blarg blarg blarg, quibble quibble quibble. For thoses of you that have misplaced your babel-fish goggles, that roughly translates to: The meaning of life is death. Before I continue there is something rather important you should know about the J'ardeen. They were the most stubborn race in the southern part of the rotten cabbage multiverse. This was the true cause of the Seven Moons war, despite what the Galactic Bollocks says. Galactic Bollocks is, in fact, the only bit of truth is the whole news podcast. It all started in a planetary spelling bee against Jovian. A Jovianian had correctly spelled plasmateriaquiasiterationer (Which ironically means ""A stubborn or hot-headed person who cannot spell"") when there was a mass outcry from the opposing J'ardlings. One bit of stubborn ignorance later and Jovian was imploded in a puff of light yellow smoke. This was the record for the shortest war of all time, 14.2 seconds. It would have been quicker, but the gunner on duty was preoccupied pondering whether his banana would have ever known true love. So, when death was put forward as the answer, there was lots of suicides and fights. Strangely, death by toaster was the most popular. This proved to be a significant problem with the answer to life, mostly due to the fact they were dead, mostly due to the lack of toast (Another popular meaning of life). This led to several other questions, the main one being: How can you live if your dead? This prompted several new books to be published, boosting the economy and allowing the J'adeen to buy more toasters, which led to more deaths. The stubbornness was almost the cause of the extinction itself, but this of course, was nothing new. They'd already been 9,637,280 civil wars on the planet in the short 8 billion years it's been inhabited. Many refused to believe that toast was nothing more than part of your 38 a day, arguing and fighting that it was the true meaning of life. By this time, of course, that was no body left to fight due to the fact their opponents had been turned into toasted slugs. The answer in the end was a simple one requiring simple technology. All that was needed was to sever the link between the body and the brains, killing the body whilst the brains remains active and toast-loving. Over the course of the next few years the J'ardeen genetically evolved themselves into non-physical conscience beings, or ""ghosts"", as they were know by humans. A J'adling conscience looks like a lime green cloud of vapour, extremely similar to the gas which Teevlers (The J'adeen's organic, living vacuum cleaners) eat. This inevitably caused the extinction of the J'adeen and the rise of the Teevler army, which went on to suck up the entire left side of the Prime galaxy, 23 left socks and a baby hippo covered in peanut butter.



A Smugian is a large green slug. It is approximately 12Dr long, and 4vtR tall. When God, or whatever it was that made the universe, created the universe it must have taken a long time. Many people think Smugia was the result of God having a break, and deciding to have a dump in the middle of the universe. Much like the Vogons, evolution took one look and the green turd crawling along the floor and decided to go have a hamburger instead. The most popular theory is their smell scared it away. Smugians do not have noses, they cannot smell the richest perfumes that a Dafer emits from its rear end. Unfortunately, this is why they're still here. If they had noses, their whole body would be inside out. It's a weird reflex to try and hide from a predator or anything harmful (They never use it since everything's already been killed by their stench). The slug would turn itself inside out to try and protect itself from the odour. If this did happen, all it would do is trap the smell inside them, slowly killing them. If would be unselfish, but unfortunately none of them are that considerate. A Smugian's smell has been rumoured to be smelt by the small worm-like people of Gax VII, 2 million light years away. This has led to many strange, yet hilarious, deaths. The most popular death on the galactic show, 'What's that smell?', are the Moscerts. They possess enormous heads 14 times bigger than their whole body. They use small servants to keep their heads from snapping off and bowling down any servants, causing their heads to snap off and roll. This is the funnier of the two ways they die. The second death that can happen is their heads simply explode. The strange thing is it seems they were made especially to explode, since when their heads do explode, confetti comes out and it makes a joyful 'hooray!' sound. This was one of the things that prompted the J'ardeen to think death was the meaning of life. Eventually UPBP (Universal Protection of Bullied Planets), put together a charity gig to help raise money for nose pegs. Unfortunately they had booked a Vogon to headline it, and ended up spending the money on earplugs instead. The Smugian smell affected 1,125,545 planets, one of which was Saltapia, home to the cute salt loving hamsters know as Hamsters. 1,125,544 planets have waged war on Saltapia, because it was literally a ball of salt. They were repelled by the cute hamsters who decided to use gorilla warfare and throw bananas at their enemies. All this was pointless as 3 months later a huge crocodile ate the planet and spat it out, straight towards Smugia. Nobody knows why it ate the planet, or why it conveniently spat it out directly towards Smugia. Nobody cared either, they were busy enjoying a new found delicacy, salted slug.

But let's look at the evidence:


Fig.1: [Don't Panic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1horffGyO0)  Starting with Coldplay's debut album, *Parachutes,* is the first song, entitled ""Don't Panic."" While the song itself seems to contain nonexistent Guide references, that's why it's number 1.


Fig.2: [42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0xfWCDLoCU)  Skip ahead a few years; and the reference here is pretty obvious, and could just be considered a nerd joke, naming a song after a recurring theme in Guide fandom. However, if we continue down the album...


Fig.3: [Strawberry Swing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb9X5jMofEo)  One of (literally!) the most peaceful songs in modern music, I've read. While *Viva La Vida's* epic, sweeping songs revolved around war, death, and consequence of power, Strawberry Swing steps away from that. It's a song about being happy in the face of loss and death, because you'll always have your loved ones. Trust me on this: *Viva La Vida's* music videos don't do the album justice. I digress. You hear that?  
&gt; ... cold cold water, lead me 'round, now my feet won't touch the ground.. 

Go ahead. Deny it. Because that one line is going to be recurring throughout the whole album.


Fig.4: [Life in Technicolor ii](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXSovfzyx28)  Life in Technicolor ii is one of my favorite songs. Like, ever. It's great. Just listen to it. As you'll see, however, this B-side is just littered with this one, solid theme that is a direct reference to the Guide. Gotten to the chorus yet? Then you've probably already heard  &gt; ...now my feet won't touch the ground...  Yes, in the *chorus!* Your counterargument is getting weaker and weaker, Debby Doubter!


Fig.5: [Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZIoFXmWbv0)  A sort of spiritual successor to *X And Y's* ""'Till Kingdom Come,"" ""Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground"" wraps up *Viva La Vida* and *Prospekt's March* together. It also contains trace *So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish* references in it's chorus, lyrics and title.


That's it for me. No speculation, no hidden messages. Just solid references to one of the greatest book series of all times by a pretty amazing band.

He had a hardback edition of the first three books, the front cover of which was a picture of a couple of planets in space, maybe a spaceship too. He told me how brilliant it was, and how I should definitely get hold of the books - all of them - to read.

I disagreed. It all looked a little bit science-fictiony to me - not a genre I've ever particularly been in to - and knowing my friend was into Star Trek in a big way made me think twice. 

In the end, he shoved a battered old copy of the first book in to my hand and *insisted* that I read it.

A couple of days later I decided to bring the book along to a road-trip my family were taking. Mum and Dad in the front of the car, me in the back, opening up to the first page of the book. I read the first thirty or so pages - up until Ford and Arthur get strapped to chairs, being forced to compliment the alien on his poetry - and decided that reading this book was the greatest idea I'd ever had. I loved it,

My mum turned round and asked me what I was reading. When I told her, both parents chuckled, my mum saying 'oh *god*...'. I was then treated to tales of my mum starting to read the same book on her subway journeys in London and, eventually, having to stop because, every time, she'd end up bursting out laughing in front of an entire carriage. Knowing how quiet and awkward London tube trains are, I can imagine just how embarassing that would be. My Dad, it transpired, was also a fan, and had given my mother the first book about the time they got engaged.

Bless.

I hope it's on topic. Because it's pretty rare to find HHGG-like stuff out there.

(If it's not on-topic, please let me know and I'll remove it promptly, don't ban me or anything!)

------

So... De-Mail. What is it exactly? And how does it work? Glad you asked. Let me see if I can describe it for you. It works like this. You send an electronic message to this service, they print it out, put it in an envelope, lick it, close it, stamp it, press it, write the addresses on the envelope by hand, then place in a mail bag, hang the bag on a horse's back, walk the horse into a shuttle, shuttle flies up to orbit, it berths with a starship, the horse is led across a docking tube into that starship, then the shuttle de-berths, the starship then flies along alone to the destination star system, ostensibly, but actually has an accident (always, every time), gets lost in space, drifting for hundreds of years (well, simulated, by highly clever software written by Stanley Opolis personally in a single weekend), the crew and passengers devolve, lose civilization, but each item of mail is preserved as a sacred duty, carried across generations either through one-on-one oral repeated retelling &amp; memorization around the camp fire, or, merely hand-scrawled on clay tablets or papyrus. And therefore, some of these messages get accidentally distorted, misspelled, misinterpreted, mistranslated. But then eventually, after their civilization recovers enough in terms of technology, a new physical letter and envelope is made again and filled out, for every single message, and, after fixing the ship's engines, and continuing on their voyage across the depths of space, eventually reaches the destination system, then, the right planet, a shuttle is sent down to the surface, and some sort of wildly mutated new animal species, that's descended and possibly cross-bred from the original horse (and sexually frustrated male crew), is led out of the shuttle, slowly walking along until it arrives at the destination building, and then carried on foot inside, and hand delivered to the recipient (or their descendants -- work with me here, work with me), by a kindly old woman (hired there locally as a part-time contractor), who is also carrying a plate of warm cookies, and a glass of milk. When you open the envelope and read the letter, the message is never exactly what was originally sent, and typically either much funnier, more insulting, wildly artistic, or kinky. Because of all of this, nobody uses De-Mail for any serious business. Fortunately for the shareholders of De-Mail Corporation, the vast majority of the galaxy's telecommunications are not serious or necessary in any way, with an estimated traffic categorization at any moment consisting of at least 10% just pictures of cats doing cute things. Sexting and the flashing of normally hidden body parts are also major categories. Therefore the founders and majority owners of De-Mail are now wildly wealthy, own entire planets, and one of them has even hired a major civil engineering firm to construct for herself a secret private ocean filled with Hyper-Coke.

This same incredibly wealthy woman also hired Stanley Opolis to build for her a custom fleet of android pool boys, with literally golden skin, muscular and ripped, and the exact abs of Ryan Reynolds of Earth. She was also quite adamant about having each android so well-hung that Stanley had to briefly bring a horse into his software studio when finalizing the design models for them in order to ensure that the androids ""equipment"" was realistic enough for her.

It was so realistic she was found dead a mere month after delivery. Her body by the side of the pool, with exact cause of death left to the public's imagination out of good taste. (Photos of the scene were leaked to the Galactic Interweb, causing both a new bill to be introduced in the Galactic Congress banning the sale of custom android pool boys, and, a short meteoric boost in the sales of custom android pool boys. It made Stanley a small fortune, and it was yet another small fortune made from what was, from his point-of-view, merely a side project.) After her death her estate was divided up, except for her pool --- the gigantic private ocean filled with Hyper-Coke -- which was abandoned and left to go wild. Within a decade a new ecosystem was flourishing in the now untended ocean-sized pool, with the most successful species being a breed of mutant flying piranha with lasers for eyes. Though the entire planet is now off-limits to tourists, sometimes accidents happen from time to time. It's been said that if you're ever in a ship that MUST crash land on the nearest planet, or, stopover for emergency repairs, the absolutely only planet you should reject immediately without debate should be this one. You'd be much better off dying in space, alone in the darkness, than finding out what happens if you splash land in a Hyper-Coke ocean filled with mutated flying piranha with lasers for eyes.

Hyper-Coke also tastes pretty good. But we'll explain more about this later.",,False,,t5_2t9xb,False,,,True,t3_1g8i2b,http://www.reddit.com/r/DontPanic/comments/1g8i2b/demail_hypercoke_a_loving_homage_to_hhgg/,
