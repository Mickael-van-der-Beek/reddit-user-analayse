But its not sadness due to his lack of recognition, it is in fact, quite the opposite.

When we drafted him, and even after his first several seasons, I had serious doubts. Surely Archie couldn't have helped birth two amazing quarterbacks! My doubts held (although diminished) past the first Superbowl victory. It wasn't until the 2009 season when he played most of the season through his foot injury that I started to believe in Eli.

Now, 3 years later, I not only believe, but know that we are truly blessed with one of the best quarterbacks to have ever played the game. It doesn't bother me that he doesn't get the recognition he deserves, in fact I love it. I love it because 10 years from now he will go down in history, and people will realize he is perhaps the best late game quarterback to ever play the game. 

It is similar to an acceptance of faith. I feel reassured knowing that whomever plays in our offensive line, and whomever lines up in the wide receiver positions, Eli will make them look like all-stars. He has helped more ""no name"" receivers put up career numbers than any other quarterback with that type of staff. Nobody makes rookies look better.

Eli has a way of picking apart defenses that few quarterbacks can replicate. I grin every time I hear ""Omaha"" or ""55's got the mic"" knowing that he's calling front line coverage to defend the blitz. And on the off chance he does get sacked, he sees it coming, and wraps up the ball tighter than Tiki Barber after years of Coughlin's training. He accepts the loss of yardage, and makes it seem like it never happened once he takes the next play's snap. Whether it was ""3rd and Smith"" of a few years ago, or now simply ""Cruuuuuuuuuuz"" he is as good at using his slot receiver to get a 3rd down conversion as any quarterback in history. Furthermore, I love the playcalling this season with all of the 4th down attempts, and would never trust another quarterback with as many as he has made.

Finally, Eli's fourth quarter magic. Every game I watch, I know that we can go into the last quarter of the game, down by almost any amount of points, and still have a legitimate chance of winning. Eli has the best two minute drill in the game. His no-huddle offense is only rivaled by his older brother, but in those last two minutes, Peyton's numbers don't even come close. Years from now, his picture will reside by Webster's definition of ""clutch.""

1357736678.0,123,self.NYGiants,168vs6,IAmA lonely German Giants fan. ,Cobarith,131,8,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/168vs6/iama_lonely_german_giants_fan/,"Hello everyone.
I am a German guy, living in my home country, and since no one around here cares much about NFL football (except for those twin guys whose father comes from *Dallas* ... D: ), you in this reddit are really my only connection to other Giants fans. I've been reading along here long before finally registering, so thank you for that to begin with.
Now that I'm sitting at home being sick I thought I'd tell you my little story before starting to ask question(s).

After visiting the west coast on a trip my godmother gave me as a present for finishing school in 2010, I took my girlfriend to see New York and Niagara Falls and visit some distant family in Jersey in 2011. I thought we should do something ""stereotype American"" and so I convinced her to go to a football game. Since we were on vacation, I just got rid of the thought of saving money all the time, instead thought what the hell and got two tickets for section 117, row 17 for $75 each, instead of just paying like $30 total and sitting somewhere up in the air, having to buy binoculars before the game.

Well, this turned out to be one of the best ideas I ever had. Although it was just a preseason game and a lot of people already started leaving at halftime, it was incredibly amazing. We were like the first people except for staff to arrive at the stadium because we started out of the city so early, afraid to get lost changing trains or something. To fit in, I got a Bavaro shirt at the merchandise, having no idea who that guy actually was... Something like two hours before kickoff we found our seats and took some pictures, later we got a hot dog and something to drink in one of those fancy cups with all the game dates printed on, and then we enjoyed the game.

While my girlfriend really had no idea about the game at all, I at least knew you had to get that ball to the endzone, or kick it through those funny posts if you can't make it, and that the quarterback was the leader because he always was the cool guy in those trashy high school movies they air in Germany when they really expect not a single person to be watching TV right then. Still, we both thought the experience was worth every buck I paid. To us the crowd was fantastic, cheering at every pretty pass or nice tackle (you may think that in German soccer stadiums they're singing all day long, but that's stereotype as well – the average fan there only moves when they score a goal, if at all). My jetlag was gone for those hours of highly entertaining sports, I was really amazed.

Now after staying through Irene with my family in Jersey I got back home and yet had to leave for university again. I had no internet connection in my flat there, so first thing monday morning was to take my laptop to classes, download the Giants game, and be gone when the download finished. Especially when it came down to those famous 4th quarter comebacks, I ran around my room wearing my Bavaro shirt, screaming at my laptop, to the point that my neighbors asked me if everything was alright (seriously). During the week I studied online guides to understanding all the rules, the different positions, play designs, history of the Giants ... like I was going to be tested on that, and not on my law stuff.

For christmas, my girlfriend had realized I was going crazy lately, and supported me by giving me quite a nice bunch of merchandise for christmas, so I had a chance to go insane on that winner-take-all game against Dallas wearing a Giants scarf with my Bavaro shirt and drinking beer from a Giants cooling mug. I was home now and could watch it on a online livestream on my TV in the middle of the night. Great thing. Since the working part of my integrated degree program now started, I then had to take three Mondays off work starting with the Divisional Round Game, which of course was worth it, especially on that morning of February 6th (timeszones, man ...).
I could not sit down for just a minute of that Super Bowl. I was running around my place all night. It was awesome :D

Now my second season as a Giants fan is over and I'm still not tired of it, and I think and hope I never will be, because I just love everything about it: even staying up all night, alone because no one shares my passion, and going to work as a complete wreck monday morning. It's just awesome.

Now, here's the thing: I'd like to return to that stadium at least once in my lifetime, and I figured a Super Bowl would be a nice occasion, since that would be one of my lifetime dreams as well (I'm saying ""at least once"" for the unprobable case I would not be able to see the Giants play at the mentioned Super Bowl). Yeah, I know the ticket prices are crazy, and getting one from Germany seems not that easy to begin with, but I really just wanted to ask when and how those tickets are distributed that, according to nfl.com, are given to the participating teams. And can you legally buy a ticket from another person at all? Can you give me any further advice?
And really just thank you for any kind of answer. I've never been talking to another Giants fan before :(

1363623395.0,101,self.NYGiants,1aj3wx,Why I think the Giants are absolutely killing it this offseason:,luckyshamrok19,103,2,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/1aj3wx/why_i_think_the_giants_are_absolutely_killing_it/,"I've seen a few posts the past few weeks wondering what in JR's name the Giants are thinking. To be honest, though, I love the moves we've made and I think we're killing it this offseason, even before the draft. Here's why:

Basically, we've lost KP, Osi, Bradshaw, Black Unicorn and Canty. Potentially Cruz, but I'll get to that. Tynes too, but kickers are kickers.

To replace KP, we re-signed Aaron Ross (who came dirt cheap after Jacksonville gave him a HUGE contract last year). Not a great signing, but I like it because it allows T2 to come back and play safety with Stevie Brown and Tyler Sash. Adding veteran depth to the secondary is always smart.

Bradshaw was a tough loss because I loved the kid, but let's be honest. He was never a top 5 back in the league, and Andre Brown looked a lot like him when he wasn't injured. Not to mention, we had one of the youngest and fastest potential stars in the league sitting at the bottom of the depth chart last season. Time to shine, David Wilson.

Black Unicorn was a great Giant for a year. Go watch 1 Brandon Myers game and tell me you'll miss Martellus. Can Myers block as well? Maybe not, but that's why we kept Bear Pascoe. This might even be an improvement.

Osi and Canty were great but it was time to move on. Osi had been an off-season nightmare for years, and he's still obviously not getting the money he thinks he deserves anywhere in the league. Canty just got pushed out- too many DT's in the futures roster to justify paying him another year. Good guy, wish him all the best.

I'll mention Cruz, but I don't think he's going anywhere. Think about the other receivers on the market of similar traits (not talent necessarily but traits)- Amendola and Welker are probably the closest. Now remember that both of those guys got big contracts from their new teams this season. Since Cruz is a RFA, any team who wants him must be willing to pay him just as much, if not more, as Welker and Amendola    **AND**   give up a 1st round pick. Even for Cruz, that's a steep price. (and probably why no one has picked up a 1st round tender since Laveranues Coles).

The bottom line on Cruz is this: If Eli wants to keep him around next year, he has to restructure his deal. Flacco got a new contract and his whole team had to bolt. Eli needs to pull a Tom Brady and get more guaranteed or he better hope Reuben Randle develops in the next 12 months.


In addition to those gaps being filled, JR went out and got Jenkins to help replace Canty, Dan Connor to sure up a LB core who have been without a clear leader for a few years (I guess Boley, but he isn't the caliber I'm looking for), and also got Louis Murphy, who could be starting somewhere as a #2 guy, for next to nothing.

Finally, Josh Brown will be a fine replacement for Tynes. Thanks for the Super Bowls and NFC Championships- I wish you could hit a FG past 45 yards. JR with another steal.

Going into the draft, I'd say Jerry Reese has put the Giants in a great position. I'd like to see Boothe come back, but it looks like we might go after a OL in the draft and hope for the best. I kind of like the idea of going after Eddy Lacy from Alabama to give Wilson a little relief from time to time and not put too much pressure on Brown, but maybe that's just me.

I went into our lunch room, saw that someone keeps putting up pics from the local papers of the pats. I figured I would match that and put up [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/O5IYC.jpg) pic. I followed everyone in during their break and people were actually **pissed** that Eli was up there (no one knows it was me yet)

my goal is to put up a new (or several pics) each day. I just downloaded about 30 Giants and Eli pics, :)

**UPDATE 1  - 4:00 pm 02-01-12**, the [original](http://i.imgur.com/O5IYC.jpg) Eli pic was taken down within 1.5 hours, I put up [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/Oi9e7.jpg) one. i'll check it in the morning due to I'm leaving work soon.

**UPDATE 2, 7:00 am 02-2-12**: [NEW PICs](http://i.imgur.com/PY2x9.jpg) were added, it's not much but i was fairly busy this morning. if you cant see them one is Tom, and one of the helmet catch...someone drew a head stone that says ""RIP"" over the NY logo, which i thought was hilarious.

i'll be putting up a lot of them tomorrow,.

**Update 3, 12:00 pm, 02-3-12**, this one guy found out it was me putting up the pics so he started raggin g on me, i went to his machine when he was on lunch and put [THESE](http://i.imgur.com/DEPQM.jpg) up. He wasnt happy when he got back to his machine. I peeked in the door and gave the troll smile, he flipped me off. :)

**Update 4, 7:00 am** i wasn't able to take photos of ""all"" the pics i put up around our plant, (for proprietary reasons) ... in summary, I was really surprised at the uneasiness putting up pics in a 98% pats fan facility caused. all kinds of people were talking  about it, and talking about me
final pics i'll post

there was more, i just didn't have time to take many more pics, i do have to work :)

First time ever at a ticker tape parade and I wasn't disappointed!  I got there super early which ensured a front row spot for the parade.  I couldn't believe how close they let us to the floats!  These floats were passing by less than 10 feet from me!

Cruz's float is passing by and Victor throws the roll of toilet paper.  I make a one handed catch as I'm taking pictures with my other hand.  Cruz's mouth drops in surprise and starts pointing at me!!  I was so busy jumping up and down in excitement that I neglected to salsa at that moment which would have been perfect.

I got Osi's attention and he was pointing his finger and nodding at me all while he recorded me on his camera as I was chanting his name, and I also caught Eli's attention and got some nodding and a smile as I'm yelling ""Thank you"" over and over!!

Incredible celebration for an incredible season!!  This will be a day I never forget.

GO BIG BLUE!!!  SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS!!!

If you dare say anything negative about him in /r/NFL you are met with downvotes are some BS testimonials that say ""he's a competitor, loves the game, plays smart and will never get hurt again."" I've seen top QB lists that put him above people like Eli, Romo and Stafford (I know that's more subjective, but it's still crazy) He's completed 14 games in his career and people are calling great and that he elevated the Redskins to a new lever, while at the same time constantly saying that Luck's rookie season was a fluke and that he was bailed out by Wayne and an easy schedule. the 'skins won 10 games, RG3 only played in 9 of those games and even then he only finished 8 of them.

AND COUSINS

Oh my God. He only played one entire game, against the BROWNS. Everyone on /r/NFL is so confident in him ""If RG3 goes down I know Captain Kirk can carry the team."" REALLY? You expect a 4th round back up QB to beat the Packers, 49ers, Broncos, Falcons, and the NFC East? 

These two QB's have an extremely small sample size of success, if someone was to say the same thing about Cutler, Eli, Tony Romo, Alex Smith or Matt Flynn you would be called a homer or delusional.

You were my dude.

He's gonna be good."" And I was right. You gave me some great memories. I loved watching you terrorize the NFC East year after year. Goddammit if I can't count how many times I got off to you sacking Donnavan McNabb, Tony Romo, Drew Bledsode and countless others. I loved how you mastered the art of the strip sack. And I'll never forget being at the Eagles game where you made Winston Justice look like a JV scrub and set the record for sacks in a game.

Now, from time to time I see Pat fans talk about it, and it always puts a smile on my face. But today, it gave me a smile, then I started thinking back to Superbowl 46.  I'm only 19, and I've been a Giants fan for 7 years, so 46 is more freshly in my mind than 42. But, as I was thinking about it, this sudden feeling came over me. That feeling I have gotten since a few months after we won where I go 'Holy fucking shit, we won the super bowl.""  And I just remember how that was the best day of my life.  And how much love I have for Eli. For Cruz. For Nicks, JPP, Tuck, Tom Coughlin, Jerry Reese, and just the Giants as a whole.  This just put me in a god damn amazing mood, for some reason. There's almost nothing I love more than saying I'm proud to be a Giants fan! You can say I might take the game a little too serious, how I take the Giants too serious, but this really is my passion. No matter how shitty a week I might have, watching the Giants play(and win) on Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays will always make my week. Now let's go win a super bowl in our own house!

Tony Romo was stirring, tripping over his blouse.

Dez Bryant's mother was hiding with care,

his body guards watching him, go here and go there.

Old Jerry was nestled all snug in his bed, with visions of superbowls caught in his head.

When out on the lawn arose such a clatter, the giants front four in a full blitz scatter!

Away sprinted Romo to the left in a dash, but snap went his collar-bone as blood pooled from the gash.

They went from surely missing the Playoffs to underdogs against the Falcons, against The Packers, against The 49ers, against The Patriots. Its been a hell of a season and I wouldn't change it for the world... Well, except for maybe not losing to the Redskins twice, but that is neither here nor there. 

The Giants are now the best of the best, and we, as fans, are their ambassadors and r/nfl is our U.N. So lets try to remain civil to the others there. Let's show them that not only are the Giants one of the classiest franchises, but they also have one of the classiest fan bases. To accomplish this, let come up with a simply motto to keep us on track. That motto is ""Don't be a dick"". Don't rub the win in. Don't excessively post about how awesome our flair is. Don't post ""Eli is Elite"" comments, everyone have their own opinions, but I'll tell you what, I only see two rings on Drew Brees fingers, and one of them is his wedding band. It is pretty unrealistic to believe the Giants will win every superbowl between now and when I die, so I would like not only the Giants, and my fandom, known for winning, but winning with grace.

So remember, Don't be a dick on r/nfl, or anywhere else for that matter.

I think we all experience this while following the Giants--that desire to be respected by the national fans and media, and have the team and especially Eli be recognized as great; every time the experts pick against the Giants after they're 6-2 or whatever, and every time someone says Eli isn't a top 5 quarterback, you get defensive and feel dissed.

However, the Giants do often fall from their fast starts. And they do often do lay huge duds at home, and play awful just when you thought they were on a roll. And Eli sometimes is just way off. And furthermore, this team clearly plays better when they feel they are the underdog, that's what Coughlin thrives on (which goes to show just how emotional a game football really is, but i digress).

I think all of this stems from the fact that the Giants are never dominant, yet always a good team, with effective coaches and a true leader (and living God-King) at quarterback. I think that treating the media coverage and popular opinions about the Giants like the Giants themselves do--quietly disagree and then prove them wrong again and again--is the best way approach being a Giants fan. 

We know we have the absolute perfect quarterback and coach for this team, and we know how capable everyone is, and we love watching them come through for us. We are happy. We don't need to prove it to anybody else.

Here is a compilation of the most interesting I have found...

* Will Beatty is PFF's 7th ranked OT overall so far this season. He has only allowed 2 sacks and has not allowed a ""QB hit.""

**Running**

* Ahmad Bradshaw has 5.6 yards-per-carry when running between David Baas and Chris Snee. Andre Brown has 7.7 and David Wilson has 15.3.

* Bradshaw has forced 12 missed tackles on 161 attempts. Andre Brown has forced 8 missed tackles on only 73 attempts.

Where do I stand, I don't know.

I'll say this.

1.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Hicks dropped that touchdown?
2.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Eli threw two really underthown passes that got picked?
3.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Manningham didn't run the fade on that pick in the endzone?
4.  Is it Coughlin's fault that Cruz dropped that touchdown?
5.  Did Coughlin get called for holding on the Touchdown that got called back?
6.  Did Coughlin rough the passer?
7.  Did Coughlin make 3 false starts?

The answer is no.  Those players did that.  No amount of motivation is going to fix that.  They were all in position to make plays, and didn't make them.  We know they CAN, but they didn't.  So, there's that.

But Coughlin is the head coach and his record in Nov/Dec is what it is and I think speaks for itself.

There are some things about some pieces that I KNOW how I feel about, and these are those.

Now, I think the Fewell can go home.  If he makes it through this with a job in our franchise, I'm going to cry.  Thanks for trying, but we can't run that defense.  Bend but don't break?  No thanks.  Nobody is aggressive, they don't know how to run it, they don't know what they're doing, we don't have the horses for it, and it's a bad idea for a defense in the first place.  When I heard that we were going to be running a modified Tampa 2, I knew this was going to be our future.  It's so hard to watch a defense that is designed to give up 5-7 yard passes all day, and designed for linebackers to cover receivers over the middle.  Really?  No blitzing, despite not being able to get pressure at all this year with 4.  Third and 17 and we rush three?  Really?  Is that Giants football?  For those of you not paying attention, we've given up 27 pts/game and almost 400 yards/gm AVERAGE.  We are the third WORST defense in the league.  Sure, we're hurt, but the scheme sucks, and the defensive playcalling is worse. Perry needs to go, and I'd rather have the uglier Ryan than Perry Fewell.  I can't stand watching this garbage after 30 years of good/great defenses.

**Aaron Ross**:  You can go eat a bag of dicks.  You just plain can't play.  I wanted you to be great, but if Prince could play a lick, you'd be on the bench.  (Prince, you get one more full year, before your bag of dicks)

**Antrel Rolle:**  You want to fire up the team, make a fucking play.  Do it on the field.  Inspire someone with action on the field, not your mouth in paper.  

**Ballard:**  I want to root for you, I do.  You're better than you've been playing.  Stop running your mouth on twitter.  You want to come to my work?  Great, pay me $20,000 for a PSL and $200/game for a fucking seat, and you can watch me every day.  Fuck you.  (For those who don't follow him, this tweat after the game ""I want to go to the jobs of some of the people that talk shit to me on twitter.” agreed.."")

**OSI:**  Where are you buddy?  What's the matter with your body?  How can you have made all that contract noise over the summer and just sit for the majority of the year.  This will be two years you've missed more games than you've played.  So, looking at your contract, $41/6 years, you've only played 4 years of it.  You've only had 3 years where you've played more than 15 games.  Now, how can you possibly argue you're underpaid.  The games you've played this year, I think we all wish you didn't.  Ugh.  Where are you?  What happened to you?

**Entire Offensive Line**:  Offensive indeed.  What else to say?

**Eli:**  These are the games where you prove to everyone why you're not deserving to be in the conversation.  You can't have these games anymore.  Particularly when it counts.  I let you go on the Seahawks game, I stood behind you after the 49ers games, but this one sucked.  I know your receivers, line and running backs didn't help you out, but still, you threw 4 picks.  Two of them were really poorly underthown balls.

**JPP:**  I'm kinda down with you, but you allowed that touchdown and got two bad penalties yesterday.  Try harder, don't get caught up in the hype and just play football.  You're good, but let's take it easy.  You've got to earn it, and you're on your way, but seriously, so was Osi.  

**Kevin Gilbride:**  It doesn't matter what you called yesterday, because the team looked like a special education  class playing soccer.  So, even though we all hate you for your unimaginative playcalling, and boring offense from the 1970s, I have nothing to say about you that has not been said.  Ten points.  7 in garbage time.  Good game plan.

**Finally, Coughlin.**  I think you're a good head coach.  I think you fall short in two places.  

**Number one:** I think you're loyal to a fault.  I think you're loyal to your staff and they don't deserve it.  I don't think you know how to evolve fast enough.  Your OC, he's terrible.  Your DC, he's terrible.   And let's talk about strength and conditioning.  We're leading the league in injuries and have had a LOT of season ending knee injuries throughout your time here.  I know you're not directly to blame for the injuries, but do you think any of it could be strength and conditioning?  Is it me, or can the fact that your teams suck at the end of the year have anything to do with how they condition themselves.  I've never seen a Giants team look so tired as I have this year.  Maybe last year.   Also, anybody with a bump or bruise seems to be missing practice.  How can you play if you don't practice.  Maybe your practices are so terrible that nobody wants to participate.  Perhaps that's a reason why we've always got 10 guys on the injury report.  (this has been consistent throughout your tenure here)  Perhaps it's worth looking at how you practice and try and find out why everyone thinks it's ok to miss practice all week, and only show up on Sundays.

**Number two:**  I think you're stubborn to a fault.  I think you're too rigid in your expectations of your team and how they conduct themselves without being able to back it up with results.  The players don't like you and it doesn't seem like they want to play for you.  I respect how you run the team, with your principals above all else, but I'm not sure that works without some key qualities that I'm not sure you have.  You are not an offensive mind, or a defensive mind.  You're a good head coach, but I don't think the players respect you like they respect people like Belichick, Parcels, Ryan, or guys like that.  Since that's the case, I don't think the hard ass route is working for you, because you need respect to pull that off and I think that most of the players just don't like you. 

Playoffs?  Who cares?  I'd rather not listen to Aikman/Collinsworth/whoever tell me how disappointing my team has been for another four hours.  I'm cool to stay home this year at this point.  I've seen nothing in any of our games to lead me to believe that we can win anything.  The defense sucks.  In the games that we've won, it's been good offense, but the defense still sucked.   You can't win in January with no defense.  

And you know what?  The Fucking **EAGLES** are going to win the division.  The Eagles.  We all know that's happening right?  The Eagles.  

Yeah, fire Coughlin I guess.  I can't do this again.

Just wanted to let you know that we're all really looking forward to this game on Sunday and that it should be a great game. You guys have picked a great time to peak, and I think you actually the best team in the NFC East.

Personally, I've never really had anything against the G-men, I rather like y'all. And I especially like you more than the Jets when it comes to NY. In fact, my preference of the NFC East is really as follows -

 1. Giants

 2. Redskins

 3. Fuck that team

 4. Fuck that team

 5. Fuck Michael Vick

We would've much rather played the Cowboys, seeing as they're a shittier team we could have beaten (plus we're used to playing in a Dome, and you guys have a wealth of playoff experience). But, we'll take what we can get (we already lucked out not playing the Saints again since Detroit lost week 17).


Anyways, best of luck to you guys! I wouldn't really hold a grudge if we were to lose to you.

That being said - [Falcons Rise Up!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flBXW78dVEc)

Couldn't have adjusted earlier, right? Gilbride finally adjusted his playcalling style, and the Giants offense saw some new runs and shorter passes that it hadn't seen in a while. Against a physical team like the Browns, Eli Manning was quick and methodical, delivering quick passes that opened up big plays later on in the game. While it was easy to pick on the Cleveland secondary, I can't imagine SF will be as generous. 

By the way, how did the refs miss that obvious pass interference on Cruz that led to the interception? One more for the stat heads to deride Eli with, I guess.

**Runningbacks**

What a performance, Ahmad Bradshaw. Most Giants fans were calling for him to be benched, as he looked old and slow coming off an injury against the Eagles. What a way to respond, AB44. While the injury to D'Qwell Jackson certainly cut down the Browns run defense, Bradshaw took advantage of his opportunities and rushed for a career high. Also, welcome to the NFL, David Wilson. On that one 40 yard run, we saw the speed and explosiveness that we drafted him for. He may have put himself in the doghouse, but he's working his ass off to get out of there. One key thing to note on almost all of Bradshaw's big runs and Wilson's 40 yard run - Hynoski had the key block on all of them. If you go back and watch the highlights, Hynoski hits athletic block after block, sometimes even leaping, and that helped create wide holes for Bradshaw to get to the 2nd level.

**Wide Receivers/Tight Ends**

/u/tootie first brought this up - Rueben Randle came close to being the 5th Giants WR to get to 100 yards this year with 82. God bless Ernie Accorsi. Despite injuries, Domenik Hixon, Ramses Barden - and now - Rueben Randle, have all stepped up in the absence of Hakeem Nicks. Sure, that's more credit to Eli, but these guys have made plays when we needed them to. And Cruz, beautiful Victor Cruz, despite being double teamed all game, rose to the occasion and caught 3 TDs. Martellus Bennett is so much better than advertised. He got injured with a hyper extended knee, but still came through and provided some great run blocking. You said he was lazy, Dallas fans?

**Offensive line**

In the last two weeks, the Giants offensive line has allowed 0 sacks. Just using the eye test, it's pretty clear that they are improving each week. Since the TB game, the Giants have been one of the best pass blocking teams in the NFL, and as they gel more, should be a force in the running game too. Beatty has been a revelation, and he followed his decent 2011 performance with a phenomenal 2012 start to the season. And FFS Coughlin, please don't put Diehl back into the starting lineup when he returns. 

**Defense**

This might be slightly controversial: I don't think the defense is as bad as us fans and the media make it out to be. Yes, there is a lack of sacks... but consider that maybe sacks are a bit over hyped? The Giants, in their first four weeks, faced mobile quarterbacks who managed to escape sacks. In Week 5, they faced off against a pocket QB, but the bigger threat was clearly the runningback. Therefore, they were less aggressive this week. Is the apparent lack of pass rush a problem? Maybe. I would say that opponents have left more blockers to counter the Giants D-line. Combine that with the fact that the Giants DT depth is lacking due to injuries, I would say that I'm not worried about the pass rush, yet. When Canty and Rocky return, we'll talk.

One thing the defense *has* done well is defend the run. No, it was not apparent on Sunday when Trent Richardson torched us in the first quarter, but to be fair, Markus Kuhn had to be the starting DT, and Marvin Austin was asked to be a significant contributor. MEME alert: If you ask Marvin Austin to play significant snaps, you're gonna have a bad time. Other than the 2nd half performances against the Cowboys and Eagles, the Giants have done very well in defending the run. 

This brings to my next point - I think that the main culprit in the bad showing by the defense is the unit least affected by injuries - the LB corp. Micheal Boley is slightly nicked up, and has only played alright. Kiwi has not had the impressive impact he had playing SLB last year, and has only been on the field sharing half his snaps with Jacquian Williams. The most impressive but most culpable member of the defense has been Chase Blackburn. Yes, he makes big plays, but he misses tackles, gets easily dominated on blocks, and really has been a non-factor everywhere but when rushing the passer. The linebackers as a unit have 11 missed tackles, 6 of them by Chase.

It's really unfortunate that Will Hill got suspended for four games. He has looked impressive in the few snaps he's played, and could be the trump card when negotiating with Kenny Phillips. Stevie Brown looked impressive replacing KP, and although it was his fault on the long Weeden pass to Josh Gordon, he recovered and played pretty well for the rest of the game. Webster had a decent game, probably a rarity. But the real star of the show is Mr. Prince Amukamara. As some of you have noted, Prince has been really quiet the last few weeks. No big plays given up, barely even noticed in TV coverage. Isn't the old adage that some CBs cover so well that QBs rarely throw at them? PFF has an interesting stat that analyzes cornerbacks, where the total number of snaps a player is in coverage is divided by the number of receptions he gives up. Some of the top 15 (with at least 100 snaps), in descending order: Charles Tillman, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Brandon Browner, Patrick Peterson, Champ Bailey, Lardarius Webb, Brandon Carr, Chris Gamble, Prince Amukamara, Chris Culliver. Not bad company to be with, even for such a small sample size. 

In conclusion, the defense is not as bad as it seems. No, the injuries don't help, but neither do the turnovers. The Bucs were spotted 21 easy points by the Giants offense. Fumble by Bradshaw and (illegitimate) interception by Eli also the Giants defense with short field position against the Browns. Without those easy points, the Giants defense has allowed 24, 14, 7, 19, 20. Certainly not bad. More stats:

* The Giants only allow 18.2 first downs per game, 8th in the NFL.

* The Giants force opponents to 10.6 3rd downs per game, 1st in the NFL. They only allow 3.4 3rd down conversions per game, 2nd in the NFL. That's a 32.08% conversion rate, 7th in the NFL. 

* Here's a bad stat: the Giants have given up 21 20+ yard pass plays, 28th in the NFL. And who's giving up most of those pass plays?

1366984426.0,33,self.NYGiants,1d5ix5,Oh those short arms and those low draft ratings (projecting rds 2 or 3),mightygiants,35,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/1d5ix5/oh_those_short_arms_and_those_low_draft_ratings/,"It seems there are two big knocks against Pugh by fans who are less than happy with the Giants first round pick.  Now I will admit I would have loved the Giants to have drafted a RT who had been raved about by all the draft people (experts and pretenders alike).  Still I have to consider the scouting process and how most draft publications do their work.  

The Giants would have had scouts looking at and evaluating Pugh throughout the season.  These scouts would judge his talent, physical ability and the like in the best possible place to evaluate such things on the football field.   Now clearly the scouts considered Pugh an impressive prospect.  Then came the combine (technically he was first measured at the Senior Bowl) and in came those terribly short arms.  

Clearly the Giants didn't ignore this measurable that would be defined as an outlier measurement and an indicator that Pugh could fail at the next level.   The Giants did what I suspect not many did.  They went back (including Jerry Reese, a former scout) and rewatched his tape to see if his short arms were causing him a problem on the field.   When all those reviews were done Reese and the scouting staff felt very comfortable that his arm length would not be a hinderance. 

Ever since ""can't miss OLT prospect"" Gallery washed out as an OLT for the Raiders the arm length measure has taken on new level of importance.     Gallery was a highly touted prospect who was drafted the year the Giants traded for Eli Manning.  The book on him was as impressive as the book on the two OLTs drafted Thursday night.   Unfortunately Gallery went to the Raiders who were a poorly run organization that did not effectively develop their talent.   Gallery was a bust at OLT and OK at ORT and eventually became a Pro Bowl caliber guard. 
All the draft experts who thought Gallery was a can't miss prospect were baffled.    Most didn't bother to consider the Raiders coaching staff and organization.  Almost all of them decided it was his arms, that were a hair over 32 inches, was the cause of his failure.   After that arm length has been the holy grail measurement of OT prospects.

Still someone forgot to tell guys like  left tackles Joe Thomas (32 1/2"") and Jake Long (32 7/8"")  that you can't play in the NFL with short arms.    Someone also forgot to tell Sean Locklear that his 31 3/8 inch arms would prevent him from playing RT at the NFL level.

I am not going to suggest arm length isn't helpful and that longer isn't better (although some studies show that length has a diminishing return and that above average arm length doesn't impart an advantage).    Still it's just a measurement, like a 40 time, and it doesn't trump play on the field.


Now as to his rating by the draft experts.  How many of them do you think did extensive study on Pugh's work at Syracuse?   How many of you think that these draft experts when back and studied film after his arms were measured at 32 inches?  Is it possible many might have considered him first round talent and when the arms were measure simply knocked a round or two off his grade?   

Pugh (with the minor exception of his arms) is nearly the model of what the Giants want in their offensive linemen.   Giants love linemen who are versatile and can play multiple positions.  Giants love smart linemen with mean streaks.   Giants love linemen who are light on their feet and can pull and get to the next level.   Pugh is everything the Giants look for in their linemen.   The fact that he was a finished product who could start sooner rather than later was the point that sealed the deal.

Then Atlanta went for it on fourth down and was stopped. Three plays later, Eli Manning threw a 72-yard touchdown pass to Hakeem Nicks, and the game was iced.
Coughlin never gets the credit he deserves for being on top of game management. Who knows if the Falcons would have converted 3rd-and-10; all I know is they were a yard short of converting 3rd-and-15, and moments later the Giants iced the game.

Not only that, we beat them in the regular season in the last few seconds of the game last year. On top of that, the season was filled with eerily familiar signs of the previous run (things like #85 making a big catch against the Patriots in a close game), while finishing the season with a sleeper 9-7 record and swinging into playoff mode with an amazing 99 yard touchdown run as the road team in our *own stadium* against our crosstown rivals. We even had a huge comeback win against Dallas with five minutes left. You can't ask for a better story.

(I know this is atrollsatan's thing, but I wanted to add some personal insight) 

Some personal notes about Sunday's game against the Steelers.

**Offense**

Where do I begin? 

* This offense has been underperforming, plain and simple, and finally we have the loss to prove it. 

* I know we love our Eli, but man is he dead out there. 

* Our receivers are also to blame, running the wrong routes, dropping easy passes, the chemistry is fading between them. 

* The run game is abysmal, the line can't make holes Brown is hot and cold, and Bradshaw's age is showing.

**Defense**

* Despite the loss, this was one of our best defensive efforts this season, at least for the middles 45 minutes of the game. Getting hands on the quarterback forcing ""fumbles"" and returning them for touchdowns. 

* The Steelers owned the clock for the second half, keeping our D in for way too long, they were tired and it showed. 

* The secondary remains a problem, once the Steelers went beyond the line of scrimmage they were racking up yards.

**Special Teams**

Tynes and Weatherford continue to bailout our offense, but it doesn't matter how good of a punter number 5 is if the other team can run it back for over 60 yards, I'm glad Weatherford was able to make that tackle, but the fact that he had to is sickening.

**tl;d**


* Offense - Bad

* Defense - Getting Better, still needs work

* Special teams - Inconsistant as hell

**Silver-lining/moving forward**

* Our terrible playing finally caught up to us, maybe now they will address our teams weaknesses. 

* Our next two games are away, we can put these cursed blue jerseys in the wash and be the road-warriors once again. (I know Dallas was away, but the the color blue seems to be our kryptonite)

* The 'boy and the 'skins lost, the Eagirls are playing the Saints tonight, regardless of who wins we'll still be in 
first.

* The NFC East has only had 4 division games, and the Giants played in  all of them, giving out fellow ""easters"" a chance to destroy each other.

**Parting Words**

If we keep playing the way we are, we're gonna lose, plain and simple, but we have the tallent and resources to be a huge threat, the G-men just need to be kicked into gear. And most importantly, at least we're not the Jets.

Is good Eli-bad Eli back? I've been saying it all year, our QB looks a bit off. He was inaccurate on a few passes, and made some bad decisions. A notable one was the interception in the endzone. Marty B runs an in-route while being covered by two defenders, and Eli doesn't notice Rodgers-Cromartie just sitting in a zone. He lobs the ball up anyway, and DRC makes the easy interception. That's a forgivable mistake, but he made a similar error in the Bucs game on an in-route to Marty B that led to an INT. Cruz also had a quick out route where Manning didn't see the defender sitting in a zone, and he was intercepted. 

There were other egregious mistakes, most importantly the throw to Barden that led to the OPI. Why not go for back shoulder there? The ball was severely underthrown, and would have been intercepted by Asomugha if not for Barden's OPI. Manning's mistake directly pinned the Giants 10 yards back. [MFW Tynes is short by a yard or two.](http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/4eca54d3eab8eacc0900001c/eli-manning-new-york-giants-sad.jpg)

**Pass Blocking**

Started off awful, but they got much better and didn't allow a sack against one of the best D-lines in the league. 9 defensive linemen that the Eagles can switch in and out? Goddamn. David Baas messing up that snap on the final drive.... C'MON MAN

**Run Blocking**

Ugh. Can't put too much blame on Brown or Bradshaw, as neither could find good enough holes. They *are* getting better though. I saw a few good holes that Bradshaw was able to take advantage of.

**Receiving**

Hixon and Barden had decent games in relief of Hakeem Nicks, but I can't help but feel that the Giants game planned for Nicks to be in the game. He was only declared out on Saturday. Barden and Hixon were running routes that Nicks usually does. I didn't see any of the WR screens that Hixon usually is good at. He was expected to outmuscle CBs like Nicks usually does, and he just couldn't, evident on the dropped interception in the endzone where Hixon was out of position because of a rookie. Barden also doesn't play to his size, so he was easily man handled by press coverage. Cruz will cruise. Marty B was taken out the game by the Eagles defense.

**Kenny Philips**

Lesean McCoy first half stats - 2 yards

Mike Vick first half stats - less than 100 yards

*Kenny Phillips gets injured*

Lesean McCoy - 123 yards

Mike Vick - 241 yards

I've said it before and I'll say it again. Kenny Phillips is the 3rd most important player on the Giants after Eli Manning and Jason Pierre-Paul. We better hope his injury is minor, because the entire defense is miserable without him. Tuck came out and said that they stopped blitzing Vick after KP went down because they were afraid to be aggressive without a security blanket. The Eagles offensive line has actually been very good this year when opponents only rush four. Perry Fewell had a brilliant game plan written up, but that all went to shit when KP went down. The Giants' aggressive forays into the backfield to stop McCoy could no longer be attempted... and when McCoy gets past the line of scrimmage, it's cutback and go. There's no stopping that. 

The Giants D-line is so good and gimmicky plans like the NASCAR package are only possible because the Giants have such a brilliant player like KP in the secondary. Perry Fewell's ""schemes"" are not always popular with Giants fans, but they often work because of Kenny Phillips. I am seriously worried about the season if he's out for an extended period of time.",,False,,t5_2ruqw,False,,,True,t3_10rgn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/10rgn9/monday_morning_perspective/,

Dallas is the only competition I think.  They've got two against the Skins, and then one each with the Bengals, Steelers, Saints and Eagles.  I think they split with the skins, beat the eagles, beat the Bengals and split the Steelers/Saints.  That's 9 wins.  

For us to get 9 wins, we need to beat the Eagles, Skins and then one of the Ravens, Packers or Falcons.  The Falcons can wrap up the division in the next 10 days.  If they beat the Bucs and then the Saints, they clinch the division before our game, which maybe means you don't get 100% from them.  The Packers are fighting for their division and they're on a bit of a roll at the moment, so that's going to be a tough one.  The Ravens...who knows what you're going to get from them.  They're like we are at the moment.  But at least they DO hold a two game lead in their division with Ben out for a few weeks minimum.  It's fairly likely that between now and our game with the Ravens that they'll have their division wrapped up and might start resting guys.

Anyways, we HAVE To beat the Skins which looks like a really tough game at the moment.  We HAVE to beat the Eagles, which is always tough - even though they are a grease fire inside of a dumpster fire at the moment. 

But really, looking at the schedule, if we are to win the division, it's going to be a hell of a few weeks because it'll mean that we have beaten some good teams.  There aren't enough bad teams on our schedule to beat up on to get to 9 wins, so we'll need to beat some playoff teams on our way. (unless Dallas just shits the bed a few times)

I'm nervous.  I'm always nervous.  I don't like our schedule, but I know in the back of my mind that it'll probably work out for us, but I'm fearful to have to watch it all unfold.  It's going to be ugly and sad.  It's going to maddening at times, and none of us are going to have any fingernails come January.

(BTW, NFL game rewind is on sale right now, and really worth it if you can afford the $50 - if you are going to buy it, let me know and I'll send you a referral link)

Anyways, I'm no coach or anything more than a stupid fan, but after looking at the tape of the games, it's clear that Eli is struggling going through his progressions.  And it's not necessarily just him and his receivers not being on the same page, although there is a good deal of that too.  I've seen a pretty good number of really open reads that he's completely missed while trying to force the ball to Cruz and Nicks.  In the Steeler game in particular, they were bringing their corners in to cover the run and those guys were cheating.  There were three plays in particular where the corner cheated on the run and left the #3 WR completely un covered.  If Eli had seen it, they'd all have been touchdowns.  I'm wondering if he feels like he's getting rushed and because of it, making really quick decisions trusting that the receivers will figure out a way to make plays.  I think that the pass blocking hasn't been really terrible so far this year, so I'm wondering why he's throwing so much into double coverage when he's got his third read so wide open.  (granted, it's the third read, but still)

Anyways, the reason I bring it up is because I'm sure they'll take this week off and do a whole bunch of self-scouting to see what's going wrong, and why they're having such struggles in the passing game.  And when they do, since they're a whole lot smarter than I am, I'm sure they'll see that he just isn't always progressing all the way through his reads.  I think they need to figure out how to flip the order of the reads until Nicks is 100%.  They're doubling Cruz and leaving a safety to roll to Nicks if he goes long, so those are going to be double coverage for the time being.  They are going to need to leverage the #3 read more.  It's time for Barden to step up into that role, with Hixon being hurt.  Either Barden or Randel, one.

Also, Black Unicorn is playing really poorly.  His routes are lazy and his blocking is garbage.  The amount of times his man has made the tackle or broken up running plays is really too high.  He's not sealing the edge on outside running plays, and he's not sealing his guy off for stretch and inside runs either.  He's got to step up his game.  I was a huge fan of his until I've watched him on the all-22.  He's not playing well at all.  Hopefully, they'll see that on the self scouting film too and do something about it.

So, all in all, I'm confident that the mistakes they're making are going to be noticed and fixed during the bye week.  I suspect they'll come out against the Packers and you'll see a little more life in the passing game.  I still expect the run game to struggle because I just don't think we've got the horses to make huge holes.  We're getting dominated on the LOS during running plays, and you don't need to watch the coach's film to see that.  I'm sorry David, but your time has come. It's time to ride the pine and being more of a coach for the younger guys, because you're not blocking well at all.

I haven't seen the Bengals tape yet, because it's not available, but I'm looking forward to seeing what happened yesterday with the defense and the passing game.  If I can figure out how to make screenshots of the video stream, I'll do it and provide some examples later on in the week, when the coach's film gets released for this game.


EDIT:  Also, a huge amount of balls that are 5-10 yards under thrown.  He's had guys running free for sure fire touchdowns and under thrown the ball which caused the receivers to slow up and allow the CBs or safeties to defend the play.  In the Pittsburgh game, the throw to Hixon which ended up being DPI, was a sure touchdown if Eli had been able to hit him in stride.  Sometimes, his under thrown balls are because he's got to hurry up and get the ball out, but mostly it's just been bad throws from his back foot.

The 2nd interception he had was due to a missed holding on Cruz, but the other two were bonehead plays. Consider the fact that all three interceptions directly led to touchdowns. When not given a short field, the Giants defense was able to hold the Buccaneers to 3 points. While Eli was brilliant in the 2nd half, let's hope he doesn't have a half like that again.

* What sparked the return of the run game yesterday? Was it just Andre Brown getting a chance, or was it something else? IMO, and this is kind of taboo to say, David Diehl's injury was the turning point of the game. As soon as he left, the blocking around Eli got a lot better, and the holes began opening up for the running game. We won't know how Bradshaw or Wilson might have done with such holes, but the truth is that Andre Brown got openings and he took advantage of them. Good for him, and hopefully, he starts against Carolina.

* Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks. JR, please sign these two for the next five years. So much chemistry between them and Eli, it's brilliant to watch. Hakeem's hands and Victor's moves... what a combo. 

* Looks like the Cowboys were half right about Martellus Bennett. Not as reliable as Jake Ballard, and there were multiple throws that he could have caught.... However, when we needed him the most, he came through. So for that, I applaud him. Suck it, Cowboys.

* Best pass rush in the league? I haven't seen it. Other than Mr. Pierre Paul, and occasionally Linval Joseph/Rocky Bernard, the supposedly great Giants pass rush has gone missing. Where are you, Justin Tuck? Where are you, Osi Umenyiora? What's supposed to be a strength of this team is looking like a detriment, as Josh Freeman had ample time in the pocket to constantly find receivers. There's no point bemoaning bad cornerback play when the line doesn't help them out at all. 

* However, run defense is looking sexy. The Giants only allowed 3.6 ypc yesterday, probably the first time in a while that the offense has a better ypc (3.8)  than the defense is allowing. Pathetic, for the offense, but exciting for the defense.

* Never put Justin Tryon into the game when trying to hold a lead in the fourth. He allowed multiple catches, one of them for a TD, and almost allowed that sideline catch that the refs (correctly) marked as an incompletion. If Mike Williams cuts inside on that play, he's gone for a TD. Also, I don't want to hear that Corey Webster is ""a top 10 CB"" from Giants fans anymore. How he has played the last two games is not how a top 10 CB should play. Coe, Hosley etc were alright, and what I would expect from a backup and a rookie. 

* Unsurprisingly, Rolle and Phillips are barely seen, except when trying to make up for the awful cornerback play. It was deja vu every time the Bucs got the ball - Freeman to WR for a completion, Giants safety stops a potential TD. The CBs were not getting much help from the pass rush, but they have to perform much better in one on one situations, instead of rolling over and allowing easy catches for Mike Williams and Vincent Jackson.
