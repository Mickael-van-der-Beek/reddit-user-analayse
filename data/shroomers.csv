Well, after a little push from a close friend of mine and some research on my part, I finally decided to give them a try.
I was nervous to try shrooms because this past year I went through an incredibly traumatic event that put me into a depression. And I thought that it would cause me to have a bad trip. I could not have been more wrong.
Everything was radiant and beautiful. I was seeing the world in a completely different way. The world was more vibrant and at the same time so peaceful. I felt connected to the world; I was one with it. It was so strange to me because I have come close to ending my life before, and after taking this fantastic drug the world just makes sense to me now and I can't imagine ever leaving it. I never want to. 
I can't really explain how things made sense, but they just did.
Everything felt right.
I have always had some self-esteem issues before taking shrooms.. But in a matter of one night I learned how to love myself and who I am, and how I look, thanks to shrooms.

I have a totally new outlook on life and I feel so optimistic for the first time ever.

1357560306.0,36,self.shroomers,16475o,Mushrooms cured my anxiety,nolongerafraid,43,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/16475o/mushrooms_cured_my_anxiety/,"I finally got the balls to try mushrooms. Holy shit I was nervous. I was scared I would have a bad trip, but I ended up handling it really well.

Here's a little background: I have chronic anxiety, PTSD, depression, and aspergers. I've been on 7 different prescriptions, tried weed, and none of them have worked. I've been to the hospital 3 times for panic attacks, and checked myself into a psych ward for 3 days once.

Saturday night, I went to my friend's house, and consumed an 8th of cubensis mushrooms on and empty stomach as soon as I got there. I'll try to recollect everything as best I can.

At 30 minutes in, I was feeling a little weird. Every now and then I'd feel like laughing for no reason.

* 1 hour: Having a little bit of a hard time thinking clearly. Whatever I was focusing on would sometimes become more intense.
* 1:30: Oh jesus, this is the best feeling ever. Everything is beautiful. My friend breaks out his guitar for a few minutes, and he sounds like some sort of master with it. Either he's really fucking good at this, or I'm just high. Looking at the TV burns my eyes a bit, and the image is burned into my eyes for a few seconds when I look away. I feel like a kid again. I'm ok with who I am - something I haven't felt for a long time.
* 2:00 Watching an animated movie. It's hilarious. Everything is so much more interesting. I'm becoming really empathetic. The TV is a fixed point against the wall...and the wall is moving. A lot.

I enjoyed that for awhile. After a few hours, everything went to hell. It wasn't a bad trip, but I started getting really fucking existential and emotional. I talked to my friend for probably 4 hours about myself, life, and everything that bothers me. Anxiety cut through me like a knife plunged into my heart and left there. My friend was amazing at dealing with this. He taught me how to be ok with it. Maybe I have to feel anxiety, but I can live with it, and it will go away.

The trip ended at about 6 hours after I had taken the mushrooms. I felt like I had been gutted like a fish, and left open to rot in the sun. I learned so much about myself. I've been undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and the thought struck me that it would have taken countless years to deal with what I dealt with in 6 hours. It was the most beautiful, and the most painful thing I've ever experienced. 
[The song Forty Six &amp; 2 by Tool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tja6_h4lT6A) perfectly describes my trip.

I wrote this Sunday morning:

Both heaven and hell in the span of an hour -

a beautiful torment that cuts like a blade.

The hand of the healer that grinds me to powder

then rebuilds my mind through the pain.


UPDATE: It's been months, and I'm still doing worlds better. I feel like the majority of my depression is gone for good.",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,1371679877.0,,,True,t3_16475o,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/16475o/mushrooms_cured_my_anxiety/,

That night she came home with a cheap dental kit from the Dollar Store.  It cost $1.99, and included a dental mirror. 

So now I can look at the underside of the mushroom caps without disturbing the BRF cakes, allowing me to pick the mushrooms at the most optimum time.

1370458763.0,21,self.shroomers,1fqlt8,"Tripped for my first time on 10g of shroom tea and as cliche as it seems, I felt like all of my life's problems had been solved.",opened_mind3,28,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1fqlt8/tripped_for_my_first_time_on_10g_of_shroom_tea/,"So as far as 10g goes, I don't think they were as potent as I expected, or I may have made the tea wrong. I didn't give it a full 10-15 minutes to soak, and the water boiled over a bit so it may have lost potency due to being too hot. I made the tea about a week ago with 135g of fresh cubensis, chopped and ground up into a near paste and boiled it with about 2.5 liters of water, 5 tea bags, and some sugar to make it sweet. I also took small doses two days previous to ease myself into my first trip, as I'm a bit paranoid and apprehensive when it comes to drugs, even weed. I often freak out on weed, and I was depressed, so I didn't want to have a bad trip.

I put 2 liters into a water reservoir out of a camelback, and the other ~425mL in a water bottle. I put the water reservoir in the freezer and the water bottle in the fridge. The next day I drank about a quarter of the water bottle (250mL) which would have been about (135g/(2.5L/.125L)) = 6.75g of fresh shrooms, or about .65g just to see what the minor effects were. I felt a little drunk/high, and had a few *minor* visual distortions, but nothing really worth talking about. I had a few paranoid thoughts about my heart stopping, but I was able to push them out of my head relatively easy.

The next day I upped the dose to the rest of the water bottle, which was about 300ml or about 15g fresh or 1.5g dry shrooms. I watched Game of Thrones and saw the facial distortions that everyone talks about. Every minor facial expression was very clear and it was obvious who the good actors were, and who the bad ones were, because their facial expressions were either really convincing or not at all. I didn't see any brightened colors or anything else. It was pretty lackluster of a trip.

Then two days later, I started melting my 2 Liter ice block and had planned on drinking up to half of it over the course of 2-3 hours to take it slow. When I got to about a quarter of the way in, effects started taking hold and I had a few paranoid thoughts. I was easily able to push them out of my head and just not worry about them. Because of that I ventured on, finishing up the rest of the half and started seeing beautiful colors. I was in such a happy state of mind, so content with life and absolutely no worry of a bad trip. I thought 'Fuck it. lets go for the rest.' Melted down and drank the other Liter of tea over the next 30 minutes and it was absolutely euphoric.

All the colors were so beautiful. 2D pictures seemed to pop out at me, I was able to see them in 3d, and it almost made me want to reach out and touch them.

It was nothing like I expected. When people talked about faces morphing, walls breathing, visual distortions and hallucinations I expected it to be not only scary, but mind numbing. Out of everything my vision and mental capacity were increased by a large amount. Everyone said that using a computer would be impossible, but I ended up playing League of Legends with my brother for the next 3 hours, playing better than I ever had before. For those who play, I normally play at a Silver I level, and I'm generally a pretty toxic player, which I would have to say is probably due to my depression. That night I found 3 koreans to play with, and they were at a ~Gold I level. I was absolutely dominating everything. Everything was so clear to me, mistakes I made, places I could go, things I could do. There were just so many possibilities. Every mistake I made seemed to open up a new window to do something else. Even after I fed 8 kills one game (Due to my mouse slipping, I had to end up moving to my desk instead of my bed) I was able to see the possibilities of coming back despite having fed so hard. Generally I would have though about how stupid I was, how terrible of a person I was, and how the game was so far over. But even despite being down 20 kills I was able to see how easy it would be to come back, given that we played the right way.

Although we didn't come back that game, the next few games I absolutely crushed. I looked up the enemy's stats and they were all Gold I-II, meaning that I was probably playing at a Platinum 5 level, which I never in the entirety of my life would have thought I could achieve.

The positive mentality from that night 2 nights ago has stuck with me for the past 2 days, and I've been a very 'honorable' player, and I feel like I've greatly improved because of that.

Playing games is great and all, and I learned a lot about the game that night, but after I was done playing, I had so many epiphanies about life. I was a bit in denial that night about being depressed. I thought that I was just a lazy fuck, but I honestly was in a very deep depression and that became so clear to me. All the commercials you see for depression medication became so clear to me. It WAS like a cloud was following me around, raining on me, or like my foot was tied to a ball and chain that I had to drag around. And this night, that had been completely lifted. Everything became so clear. Just like the game, I was able to see so many options in life. After nearly failing out of college, I saw the option to actually finish it up despite my past. And should I not be able to finish up, I saw other options I could take, getting a job and living happily despite not having a college degree. I had other thoughts, what if I started tripping too hard and got caught by my parents who were sleeping in the other room? I even saw positive possibilities from that. I was so comforted by all these open windows and lifelong possibilities that for a solid 20 minutes I was just awestruck. I said ""wow"" out loud at least 12 times. Thinking to myself ""life really CAN be this good."" I had the overwhelming feeling of being exactly where I needed to be in life, that I was a cog in a complex system of living creatures, and that I wasn't so bad off after all.

For the past 2 days not tripping, I haven't been quite as happy as I was that night, but I definitely feel that the depression is long gone (at least for now). I've felt the urge to clean my room, go out and exercise, and to be friendly with people who I hadn't previously cared for. And my family has noticed it, saying they're so glad that I'm feeling better, even if it has only been 2 days. I didn't realize how much my depression had a bad effect on my entire family. My little brother's sadness seems to have been gone, he is waking up for school much easier, my dad and mom went exercising yesterday and had a great time, and my mom's depression also seems to have gone away.

Tl;Dr: Tripped, played games, mental performance seemed very much increased, metaphorically could be described as a 'kickstart to my system'. My severe depression seems to have faded at least for now, and I have the motivation to go back to school next semester and kick some ass.",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,False,,,True,t3_1fqlt8,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1fqlt8/tripped_for_my_first_time_on_10g_of_shroom_tea/,

So basically I wanted to post the best way to do it for people, as it is something that is very much worth experiencing, and I'd like to circulate the information to fellow trippers. So here's the instructions:

* Grind up your (dried) mushrooms using a coffee or weed grinder, reduce it to a fine powder.
* Get enough lemon juice to suspend the powder. Although it's not great to drink I like to us two lemons as it speeds up metabolism, and so increases the Lemon Tek effects.
* Combine the two, leave for twenty minutes stirring occasionally.
* Drink the whole concoction down! It's not very pleasant but it sure does work.

And that's it. Using this method your trip should feel twice to three times as strong as your dose regularly would (although individual variance can affect this hugely). Duration is decreased and onset is increased, with the total trip lasting roughly four to five hours and onset being within twenty minutes of drinking the potion. Sorry for the wall of text, and I hope this information is of some use to others, I found this method to be a great way of using mushrooms and wanted to make sure the information was available.

I found that Johns Hopkins university are looking for participants in a new study on psilocybin, specifically they are looking for people to answer an online survey into their experiences with a ""bad trip"".

I think its really important for the community to get involved in stuff like this, so that the truth about these harmless little beauties becomes academically established. It will go a long way into helping the conversation on legalization and rational treatment of all psychedelics... so get involved!

I gotta say, the trip has been like pressing the emotional reset button on my life, and now I can feel again.

========================

I have such clarity of feeling. I can actually feel now, whereas before I just had the illusion of feeling, or carried on the facade of feeling. Even though I wanted to feel and knew what I should have felt, sometimes it wasnt there. Now that is all gone. I feel as I felt after the motorcycle accident, where I couldnt see a bum on the street without giving him 5 dollars. 


I want to remember how it feels right now, being coming-down-off-shrooms.
I feel as though I will give myself in an instant to save my partner. Other women too for that matter. Any of the women I have slept with, I will throw myself in front of a train to save them. My partner most especially. There only needs to be a hint of danger, and my life is forfiet. 


I want to give of myself to everyone in everyway I can. I want to tell everyone I know and everyone I meet that I love them. Because I do. I really and truly do. I have felt this before, but havent felt it in a long time. Like Modest Mouse says, on the day you die you will see all the faces of all the people you have met, and I wish I could tell them all I loved them. Every last one.


I did see some interesting visuals about 6-8 hours in, but not much besides swirlies and so on so forth when looking at the floor or the clouds. I only took two whole fresh cubes, where as the person I did them with took 4. He started laughing histerically about 3 hours in. It got to the point where he could not breath unless he was laughing. 


All I can say to any first timers is that you should start with a small dose, and bump it from there. In all reality, mushrooms are *easily, by and far, one of the safest drugs* **in my opinion.** Most of the trip just felt like being stoned on really good pot. That is probably related to the dose that I took, and the fact that the veil hadn't broken because the guy who gave them to me was impatient and didnt let them be in the sun long enough. I will be growing my own and tripping again soon. This definitely wont be the last time.


&gt;The name of the Modest Mouse Song is [Life Like Weeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3QeEvgMG1s):
&gt;
&gt;I could have told you all that I love you.
&gt;And in the places you go, you'll see the place where you're from.
&gt;I could have told you all that I love you.
&gt;And in the faces you meet, you'll see the place where you'll die.
&gt;I could have told you all that I love you.
&gt;And on the day that you die, you'll see the people you met.
&gt;I could have told you all that I love you.
&gt;And in the faces you see, you'll see just who you've been.
&gt;
&gt;I wish I could have told you all...

Although our site itself is believed to be secure, I have an account on a different site which is vulnerable. This allowed people to retrieve the list of users and passwords in plaintext. To my embarassment, I disregarded basic security practices, and re-used my password on certain sensitive parts of the Shroomery and Growery. This problem has existed at least since August, and possibly much longer.

We are extremely lucky to have been alerted to this problem when we were. Unfortunately, due to our limited retention of log files for privacy purposes, there is no way to determine who might have discovered and exploited this issue in the past. It is with great contrition and embarassment that we wish to inform any members of the Shroomery and Growery that the following information could possibly have been leaked to untrusted third parties:

* E-mail addresses associated with your account
* Unencrypted private messages
* Posts in restricted or private forums and journals
* IP addresses associated with your posts
* Image uploads, including those which were not made public
* The SHA-256 hash of your password

The last item is especially important. Although an SHA-256 hash is believed to be one-way (meaning you cannot deduce the actual password from the hash), this is not always the case in practice. If someone has a large dictionary and a fast computer, they can try millions of passwords every second, and eventually find a hash that matches. If your password is a common word, or combination of words and numbers, or a geometric pattern on the keyboard, or leetspeak, it can potentially be retrieved with a dictionary-based attack by someone who has our database. If you use the same password on other sites, especially e-mail, banking, or social networking, please make sure to change it on those sites immediately!

I wish to be clear that, except for the individual who alerted us to this problem, there is no indication anyone has actually made use of this exploit. I am simply offering full disclosure and recommending an abundance of caution.

Going forward, we are implementing new security policies to prevent the re-use of passwords, and require multiple types of authentication for sensitive admin scripts. We have switched to bcrypt hashing with per-user salts for passwords, which will help prevent dictionary-based attacks in the future. The site is more secure now than it ever has been, and we will continue to work to protect our members to the best of our ability. We hope you will forgive us for this recent failure.

If you have any questions, you can post here, or there's also a [thread on our site](http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/17416556).",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,1355940466.0,,,True,t3_154aev,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/154aev/attention_anyone_with_an_account_on_the_shroomery/,

Searched exclusively in the grassy sand dunes adjacent to the ocean which is prolific with Ammophila maritima and dead wood. From research knew that p. azurescens flourish in this season and environment. The mushrooms found match many features of p. azurescens such as, ascending sinuate/adnate brown gills, long white stem thickening at the base with coarse mycelium, dark purple spore print, and rapidly bruising flesh from blue to black. The only thing that threw me off is the ones found were missing the distinct UFO shaped cap and were also a light tan as opposed to a dark caramel color. 

I dont have a great camera but below are some pics i took before and after drying.
Any input is appreciated.

My friend and I waited all day to get them. We ended up buying 3gs a piece and when we got back to his place, we cooked a pizza and put the mushrooms on top, and consumed them. It was about 9:45 (at night). Soon after, his brother comes home off of work and volunteers to be our tripsitter.


I started feeling light and things started to slow down a bit 20-30 minutes after we ate them. My friend also started to feel the effects coming on. Now, my friend and his brother are big acid heads. And you can tell when you walk into his room. Trippy posters, black lights, crazy things all around the room. At 10:30 the trip was hitting me, and my body could not stop shaking. I wasn't panicking or anything, as the visuals became greater I was really enjoying it. The thing I wasn't enjoying, although was how I felt physically. I couldn't get into a comfortable position, my limbs felt heavy, I would have random parts ache for a split second. As the trip intensified, my mind started racing. I was still calm and not panicking, it was just like my thought process was going a lot faster than I'd expect it to. We were playing Marvel vs Capcom 3, but couldn't win because we'd be too focused on what was going on in the background rather than focusing on the actual fighting. My friend was spiraling into a bad trip, he kept on yipping about how hard he was tripping and couldn't stay still. I just kept telling him to ""Chill out"" and ""Calm down"" because I was afraid if he lost it, a usual acid user, then I'd forsure lose it.


He sat back down and we continued to trip out. The whole room was moving, like everything was breathing. All the bright lights were sticking out like a sore thumb. When I'd look at something, then look somewhere else the image would still be there. I was starting to see patterns everywhere. We were definitely beginning to peak. So, my friend goes ""When do you want to smoke that weed man?"" and I said ""Now."" So us two and his brother go out in his backyard to smoke out of their bong. Now, their mother is a really floral person. Crazy plants everywhere, a forest out back, vines and roots and leaves all around the wooden planks of their patio. I looked out into the forest and I saw plants that were shaped like faces, lots of them. I just laughed and said ""that's awesome"".


After we finished the bowl, I was on the most insightful, spiritual, self-discovering trip ever. I opened up to my friends, telling them how much they mean to me, opening up about my dark family past, and I was realizing who I was as a person and who/what meant a lot to me and did not mean anything to me. At this time I'm tripping balls, I look at the ground and there's kaleidoscope patterns everywhere. I look at the nearby roots and leaves, and they look as if they're breathing to. But with every 'breath', the leaves would go from vibrant green to old and brown, almost dead. I look over to my bud that's also tripping, and it was identical for him. I looked at him and it looked like with every 'breath' his hair grew longer and his face aged. It was like I was looking at life breathing time or something like that. I felt way attuned with nature. It was very spiritual for me.


We go back inside, we're both coming down. We both talk about how awesome the trip is, and I get to bed at about 4am. I definitely will have to do this again. Rock on, shrooms!


TL;DR: I had my first trip, it was almost a spiritual awakening for me, I bonded with my brothers, it changed my life, I love the Earth.",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,False,,,True,t3_13miq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/13miq9/first_time/,

I was trying to grow some B+ cubes on BRF cakes. I took meticulous care of these cakes-- they were my babies. Humidity gauge always read 90-100%, misted the perfect amount, always had FAE, etc. I followed all of the guides step by step and produced only measly small shrooms that were all disfigured. 

So I said fuck it. I'm starting over. I wanted to do a monotub grow. I tossed (literally) the BRF fruiting chamber into my garage and walked away. About 3 days later I remembered I never threw them away, so I figured I should get rid of them before any bad mold starts to spread. Alas, to my surprise, there were 10+ shrooms all 4-5in long, and as think as my thumb.

The weather has been humid enough to keep these babies growing. They were literally laying in a mess of perlite, knocked on their side, and ignored for 3 days. Yet, a massive amount of mushrooms still managed to thrive.

I am completely amazed at how resilient the mycelium is and how well these mushrooms grew. Just take this into consideration if you're ever worried about giving your cakes the perfect conditions.

1. I did not extract in the hot water bath long enough. I extracted for 1 hour when I've read of people extracting for 4-7 hours.
2. Perhaps the psilocybin was rendered ineffective from heat?

At first it gave me a very happy and euphoric feeling, which lasted throughout the trip. The next thing we experienced was heightened visual senses. Everything started to look ""high definition"". My thoughts felt more clear, but I did have troubles when trying to think of specific things. 
     We laid down on a hill and looked at the clouds, which covered the sky as it was an overcast day. In the center of my vision, the clouds would move normally, but in my peripherals, they swirled back towards the center. As I looked longer, they began to what looked like ""bubble"". After a little longer, the clouds dissolved revealing a clear blue sky, which then turned hot pink. After closing my eyes for a few seconds, the sky would go back to overcast.
     After looking at the sky, I would look into the woods, which at first appeared dark, but would fill with color after a few seconds. Being spring, there were many beautiful plants and flowers to admire.
     I also had plenty of indescribable closed eye visuals.

Interested to hear what you guys have to say about the things i thought about during my experience or if any of you have had similar experiences.and, if you were wondering, afterwards i had a really nice long conversation with my mom, a cup of coffee and a lovely shower!]

•	MAGIC MUSHROOMS ARE OUR TEACHERS AND YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO PURGE
•	AT THIS POINT I FEEL NATURALLY AS IF I AM WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO BOTH KNOW THE ANSWERS AND ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS, A SYMBIOSIS OF BEAUTIFUL YIN-YANG; AN EXPRESSION OF THE NATURAL WORLD OR RATHER A MANIFESTATION OF HOW OUR SOCIAL GAMES ARE JUST AS NATURAL AS THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE TIDES EVERY DAYÍ

•	I FELT AS IF I HAD LET AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF MONKS, OR RATHER, ALL THE KNOWLEDGE INSIDE ME THAT I NEW I HAVE HAD ALL ALONG WAS OPEN COMPLETELY AND THOUSANDS, GROVES, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL FROM THE WONDEROUS RECESSES OF MY HEAD BOTH REAL (PARENTS, FRIENDS, FRIENDS PARENTS) AND JUST PEOPLE OF THE WORLD CAME TO ME AND MY KNOWLEDGE AND IT WAS TOTAL PEACE, TRANQUILTIY AND DAO UNDERSTANDING. IT WAS THE MOST SIMPLE EXPRESSION OF LIFE AND THROUGH HELPING THESE “PEOPLE” ONE BY ONE ACHIEVE A ZEN UNDERSTANDING I WAS REAFFIRMING TO MYSELF, AND EVERYTHING WAS EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD BE

•	AND THEN I PURGED, A LOT, BECAUSE I NEEDED ABSOLUTELY NO MORE THAN THE XPERIENCE RIGHT THERE.. THE VAST AMOUNTS OF (OR NO AMOUNT, NEGATIVE AMOUNT, JUST SPACE) OF SERENITY THAT EXIST IN NATURE ALSO EXIST IN MY HEAD AND OTHERS WILL SEEK ME TO ATTEMPT TO FEEL THAT SAME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING AND MY WHOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO HELP PEOPLE PEACEFULLY COEXIST WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF REAL-LIFE AND REAL-NATURE AND THE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANYTHING AND ANYTHING ELSE

•	TONIGHT WAS LOVELY AND THE CLEANING WAS HALF THE FUNÍ

•	YOU REACH APOINT WHERE BRINGING THE MUSHROOM TEACHERS AND THE SUBSTANCE HELPERS IS GLUTTONOUS, BECAUSE I KNOW EVERYTHING I NEED TO, BUT MUSHROOMS AND THE LIKE WILL ALWAYS RESET YOU AND REAFFIRM THAT WHICH WE ALL KNOW AT OUR CORE

•	 DRUG USE IN GENERAL AS A MANIFESTATION OF ATTACHMENT, ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS OF HUMAN LIFE TO BE COMPLETELY ALOOF FROM ESPECIALLY IN THIS SOCIETY AND WITH OUR HISTORIES, DRUGS CAN HELP US IN MODERATION, TEACH US THINGS, AND RUIN OUR LIVES, AND TURN US INTO THE SUBSTANCE THEMSELVES. MODERATION AND BALANCE, AS WE SEE EVERYWHERE AND EVERYDAY IN NATURE, IS THE KEY TO A HEALTHY HAPPY HUMAN LIFE AND IT IS SILLY TO ASSUME WE SHOULD LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE

•	WORDS THEMSELVES ARE A GLUTTONOUS PRIVILEGE AND LACK SO MUCH IN WHAT THEY INTEND TO DISPLAY. HOWEVER THEY ARE A VESSEL IN WHICH SOME IDEAS CAN BE EXPRESSED AND THEY ARE ALL WE HAVE,

•	WHAT IS TRULY BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPENS AMONGST FRIENDS IS THE WORDLESS ABSTRACT EXHANGE OF IDEAS….THIS IS PURE AND COMES WITHOUT ANY OF THE CONNOTATION OR PRECONCEPTIONS THAT WORDS MIGHT CARRY WITH THEM

•	WHEN ONE USES WORDS HE MUST USE THEM CAREFULLY AND CHOOSE VERY DELICATELY WHAT HE SAYS BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER BE QUITE SURE HOW SOMEONE ELSE WILL UNDERSTAND WORDS THAT YOUR INTENTION WAS QUITE DIFFERENT

•	SPEAK CAREFULLY, SOFTLY, CHOOSE WORDS CAREFULLY, DO WORK WITH INTENT AND SHOW OTHERS THE WAY

•	IF ANYONE COMES ASKING FOR HELP, SHOW THEM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND LET NATURE DO EVERYTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY JUST ASKING FOR A WALK IN THE WOODS AND SOMEONE TO LISTENTO THEM 

•	SO SAD TO SEE MAN AS SEEING HIMSELF AS COMPLETELY DIVIDED FROM THE WORLD AROUND HIM SO MUCH SO THAT HE NEEDS DRUGS MUSHROOMS THC LSD ANYTHING TO FULLY REALIZE THIS IS WHERE HE CAMES FROM BELONGS GREW UP AND WILL DIE

•	BUT EVERYONE HAS HOPE AND MUSHROOMS AND WALK IN THE WOODS CAN DO A WORLD OF GOOD FOR MOST PEOPLE

I had gone from 180 to 165 solely from dietary changes, which I then supplemented with swimming. I went down to about 140 and leveled off there. 

I went through a fairly serious depressive episode and I gained the weight back, though not as much when I first started. I had gone out for a swim, and found I could only swim back and forth once and then I had to stop.

So I had taken some of my shrooms, and decided I'd go for a pleasant swim on them. Then, the most amazing thing happened. I could just swim and swim and swim without stopping. I swam 20 laps in the back and forth style without stopping, and I only stopped because I wanted to, not because I was exhausted.

Just wanted to share with you my next adventure of the magical type! This is PF's [Alcohol Extraction TEK](http://www.fanaticus.com/mycoalki.htm) and it is SUPER interesting!
So let me tell you why this TEK interests me and why it should interest you too. Not only does this tek make dosing uniform where as shrooms can vary fruit to fruit, but it also is very potent! Taking the mediocre P. cubensis and vaulting it to the top of the potency list!
Also, and here is the best part, you can use this tek to extract psilocybin from your PF cakes and used substrate! 

So, I recently had about 7 out of 14 jars stall and stop colonizing. I found out it was because my sub was not mixed well and perhaps was too rich in BRF but regardless I birthed these cakes ranging anywhere between 95% &amp; 25% colonization. I washed the un-colonized sub off in the sink and was left with only colonized substrate. 

This tek is awesome because if your cakes stall out, all is NOT lost! You can use these cakes after they are bone dry or you can use some old shrooms you have around the house.

Hope you enjoy, I will post pics in a few days after I complete this tek!",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,False,,,True,t3_13hted,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/13hted/alcohol_extraction_tek/,

I'm going to skip all the silly crazy shit that was just me feeling the affects of the shrooms and talk about the epiphany I had.

I decided to try and go to sleep and be done with it and laid down, then my eyes just started freely moving left to right rapidly for about an hour, I could tell because I could see the lights on the entertainment center moving left to right rapidly.

It felt like my body was asleep but my mind was awake, and I could think clearer then I've ever been able to think before.

Then all of a sudden, not caused by anything particular I was thinking about, it was like I became one with myself.

To describe it, I'll say what I tell some people I know, there's me at work then there's me not at work. Now there are actually quite a few ""mes"" for various scenarios. But last night it was like they all aligned. I felt amazing. I still feel amazing, it's like I'm a new person. I even look different to myself in the mirror.

It's like if you took a goldfish out of his bowl and put him into the ocean and exposed this great big giant world to him.

I can't wait to go into work today and see what happens, although I'm still adjusting to this new body.

EDIT: Oh, I actually wrote this before work but went to work. There's this one guy who I really thought was cool but then this girl told me the other day one time when I got off work he said to her ""I hate the fucking faggot.""

But he's always cool to me, and actually one time when the girl I mentioned got off he came up to me and told me he hated her and talked shit. So today I went up to him and was like ""Ben, I gotta talk to you about some fucked up shit Jenny told me"" and he denied it but was clearly full of shit. I just said ""Okay"" after I heard him out and it was clear he was full of shit, and then walked away. He couldn't look at me for the rest of the day.

Catoctin mountains in Maryland . I have had many experiences with mushrooms and many different type of experiences . Before last night, it's been a couple years since my last trip. One of my most recent trips was both my powerfully blissful as equally scary. I tend to ride a wave and I'll admit that it's hard for me to keep my grip for the whole duration . I wish I was better at this . As for my trip last
Me and my two buddies spent the day hiking with plans to end the day back at the campsite with dinner and mushrooms. So around 10 pm we take some. Small doses. A cap here a stem there and over the course of the next 2 hours we sat around the fire and howled laughing . Haven't laughed that hard in ages. Truly a great feeling to be with friends that don't get to hang out as much as we did in the old days . As the night goes on we become a little more adventurous and travel outside the campsite into the complete darkness of the mountain. This is where I started seeing some visuals. I could see their bodies outlines in the darkness but their faces were black. This black void let my imagination come up with some pretty freaky but still fun faces. We wandered around the mountain campground admiring our campfire from afar and how the light was reflecting off of the trees and smoke. We made a couple trips through the night from the fire back to our little adventure. So one last time we take another dose of shrooms. This time a big thick blue stem. And this is where things go from a light hearted good trippy time to a complete mind fuck. 1 of my friends went to bed so it left just my one friend and I. I suddenly began getting this anxious feeling. An un easy feeling. I knew something was up. Then I began yawning and getting tired myself so I closed my eyes...... I will do my best at explaining this... When my eyes were closed I didn't just see darkness... I saw colors... Ugly colors... In odd creepy spider leg shapes. Then I'd see structures.. The perfect way to describe what I was seeing in my eyes was something from a damn tool video. So scary to me that I couldn't keep my eyes closed I had to open them.... But then the blanket of being so tired floated over me and was trying to lead me back to closing my eyes. I was in a hardcore scary catch 22.. So tired and needed to sleep. When I'd try and sleep I'd see horrible things. something in my mind was telling me there was an artist in my brain creating these images and it was a female. I really started bugging because time started moving slower and slower. My other buddy goes to bed to I'm left by myself . I lay down in the tent and try sleeping. Same thing. Then I open my eyes. This time I'm in the tent and it's pitch black. The fire was dying out. My phone was almost dead. I'd soon be with out light . My only source of reality I was holding on to. I go to my car and plug my phone in and call my cousin. We both had this exact experience prior . Last time I just bugged out for hours. I wasn't doing it this time. I was a lot calmer then previously. I tell him my situation and he talks to me. Explains how I control what light my mind sees things in. Gave me a speech about how I needed to go back in the tent and turn this ship around. Stop panicking. Stop thinking about the scary things I'd see. And take advantage of this. After 15 minutes I decide to go back into the tent and face my fears. I laid there. Laughed, smiled, chilled out. And closed my eyes with a positive attitude. This is where things take a turn. Something was different . Colors were brighter. I had a euphoric feeling blanket me. And then I finally met her. The dark artist. From this point on I was completely emersed into what looked a psychedelic cartoon. She was yellow. By no means human. She resembled Woodstock, snoopys friend. Yellow with hints of different colors and tentacles... These tentacles were just spinning and twirling. And I said to myself .. So this is what it's like if I don't resist... And the yellow creature smiled.and nodded. And then it was on. Kaleidoscopic hearts twirling into each other . Colors just smashing and rolling . Purely beautiful and blissful. It was right there where I learned that I'm in control of the positive and negative thoughts I'm projecting and if I just let the shrooms do what they do and don't fight them , I can enjoy my trip unlike anything I've ever experienced before. Hopefully this makes some sense as I'm typing into my notes on my phone .

I started two liquid cultures with the two core samples. After the LCs colonized I inoculated two pint jars of WBS to test the LCs. They colonized fine and I inoculated 12 quart jars of WBS, 6 of LC, 6 of the other.

I spawned 11 jars, 5 in one tub and 6 in the other via Damion's coir tek. (keeping the respective clone spawns separate by tub). I accidentally pushed the filter and broke the silicon seal on one of the jars, it colonized fine after but I decided not to spawn it and risk contamination.

I have never had shrooms before, but my first jars are well on their way; one is at 95 % colonization right now. I have, however, smoked trees and had alcohol before. One thing that I always realize while under the influence of either is that there is a world outside of what I'm experiencing. That is, there is a real world, where people are sober and act natural, and I will return to it eventually. If things ever get a little intense, I just remind myself that there is a real world, and I will return to it. That tends to calm me down, and keep me from making excessively stupid decisions. 

When I finally do get the chance to experience shrooms, I am wondering if while under the influence, I will be able to realize that there is still a real world outside. I'm sure it depends at least somewhat on the dosage.

I bought the boomers from my friend whom I trust very much, but we didn't have a scale on hand so he eye balled me 2 grams. I ate about 2/3 of it (so 1.3 grams) at my friend's house because I planned on eating the rest an hour later to make my come up more gradual. I hadn't anything for about 6 hours before I ate the shrooms, and I only ate them with orange juice, no other food. I started coming up very quickly, and initially I was afraid of how hard I thought I was about to trip, but then I embraced it as euphoria set in and the fear completely went away. After about half an hour I decided I didn't need to eat the rest because I would trip sufficiently with this amount. My visuals started when I looked into a flower and saw fractals and patterns that seemed to suck me in. Colors became more vivid and light seemed to have a ""rainbow effect"" that I can't really describe. I sat down and closed my eyes and I experienced extreme closed eye visuals, it looked like a visualizer on Xbox when you're listening to music on there. I puked, then we went into the woods and had a great time. Later we listened to some music and I was almost brought to tears when we listened to ""cat's in the cradle"", and we had some serious philosophical discussion. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if this was a typical trip for what I thought was a low dose, or if the fact that I hadn't eaten anything and I smoked quite a bit of weed before and during the trip may have enhanced the effects, because I'm curious about how much to eat next time.

It was a wonderful experience, and thanks in advance for any comments or advice!",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,False,,,True,t3_vc6hq,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/vc6hq/my_first_trip/,

It seems that there are a lot of frequently asked questions around here about shrooms, and I'm personally not a fan of seeing the same question multiple times in a week. So I'd like to make a thread every once in a while with a FAQ to discuss, maybe to add it to the sidebar.

So, today we'll help answer the question ""Does this look like X grams to you?"" **In the comments below, describe how you might answer the question, and link to pictures of known quantities of shrooms so that I can fill in the table below** 

Example posts:

* [Does this look like an 1/8 roughly? They are hard and snap if you bend em enough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1bn2nu/does_this_look_like_an_18_roughly_they_are_hard/)
* [How many grams does this look like? [PICS]](http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/1eo3je/how_many_grams_does_this_look_like_pics/)
* [First timer - rough estimate, how much does this look like? 2 pics](http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/1ci8b3/first_timer_rough_estimate_how_much_does_this/)

___________________

**Answer to your ""Does this look like X grams to you?"":**

There is no good way to determine the weight of shrooms by eyesight alone. **Your best bet is to get a scale** so that you can weigh it out properly. The potency can also highly variable from shroom to shroom, so even if it was accurate to determine the weight by eye, it still might not accurately determine the potency.

**However**, most people who are asking this don't have the time, money, or motivation to go out and buy a scale of their own. For that reason I have created a table below which you can eyeball for yourself what you think is about equal.

Note that wet shrooms are about 10 times as heavy as dry shrooms. In other words, dry shrooms are 10 times as potent by weight.

I'm pretty happy with this so far, I got 110g off the first flush of BRF cakes but I had to discard a significant amount of rotting shrooms which was a bit disappointing, all up it might've weighed about 150g.

A couple of things I noticed have got me wondering if I've got a condition wrong. A few fruits grew really early on when they were put into the chamber but the bulk didn't start to grow until about a week later. What's up with that? should I harvest the early ones? I was worried about shocking the mycelium and causing aborts. Also the fruits were pretty staggered, like 3 would grow then like another 5 or something and then suddenly 10 or so would pop up. I was under the impression that they should more or less mature at once.

Also regarding veil breaking, this was happening really really extremely early in development. Shrooms would be maybe 1/5-1/4 of their full size when the veil would tear, is this likely to be some strain artifact or are they trying to mature too early for some reason?

One last thing! The first few were much thicker than all of the others. Normal?

Since I recently finished my first attempt at growing, had a few people over to test them out. I've tripped quite a bit but never tried any inhibitors or teks to increase the intensity of my trip. 

I pulverized 3g of my B+ in a coffee grinder and stirred that with the juice of one whole lemon. Let that sit for about 25 minutes and topped it off with a little sugar and some pulpy orange juice. 

I saved 1g of them aside to munch on after, as to not face 4g altogether (especially powdered.) The come up was extremely intense, I've had teas and I've powdered them before, but this way far more intense than any other time. I went through a good 20-30 minute period of panic, which has never happened to me before. By the end of the first hour I was absolutely fine and on cloud 9. Very introspective and the moonlit clouds with snow falling were beyond humbling. 

I'd recommend at least trying the lemon tek to compare with a regular dose. I felt like it made the trip start far faster than other methods, but once the initial launch calmed down it was very enjoyable. 

Has anyone else tried this? Seems to be kind of hit or miss between people in favor of soaking in lemons and people saying its a bunk myth.

Last night I chopped up about 83 grams of fresh PB from my first flush... I split that between Myself, my girlfriend and our roommate. I made my tea with about 32g, my gf's tea with about 30g and my roommates tea was like 14g with 2 dried shrooms weighing a gram. (Lost some of the original water weight of the shrooms in the fridge.) My gf did not finish all of her tea so me and the roomie split the last couple ounces of liquid.

Our setting was great. Back yard bonfire just chilling around the fire drinking tea on a cool evening in the mountains.

Onset was fast. Felt a body buzz before I even finished my cup. By the time I was finished I was coming up fast. Started to see CEVs within 15 mins. By 45 mins hilarity ensued. We were laughing about everything hysterically. I was hoping the neighbors wouldn't hear us. 

By an hour my CEV's were incredible. Twisting and turning rivers of geometric shapes. Universes of depth. Vast space with shapes traveling throughout. Twisting and spinning psychedelic floral patterns that would spin and then stop instantly. I was in another world!

The whole night I just kept thinking about how fucked up I was. How different these were from the 30 grams I ate of B+. B+ was really mellow. Very introspective. Very philosophical. 
PB was pure psychedelics! I didn't have any revelations because my brain was so overloaded with shapes and swirls and visual information.

I stood in the kitchen for about 10 mins stairing at our flourecent lights. The were breathing like crazy. Almost pulsating... Then my gf made me come back out by the fire. 

As the fire died and I started to get cold I talked her into going into the house. We had to round up our dogs that were also outside with us but they would not come inside! It was like they knew something was off about us. They seemed very on edge. When we got them inside it was chaos for me. I was on the verge of passing out I was tripping so hard and my dog was whining and licking my face. It was away too much for me. I started to see condensation droplets and sweat dripping when I closed my eyes. It was like heat, sweat and stress. Then all of a sudden I became very hot and had to strip down. Then I was freezing cold. These waves of hot and cold stayed with me till the end.

After I laid in my room for a bit kind of freaking out that I had taken too much I almost got online to see how to come down. I turned the PC on and sat there but I couldn't really work the computer. I turned it off and laid back down and started talking sense into myself. 

My gf put on some electric sheep and I let that ride me out of the trip. We were listening to the radiohead station on pandora one and that really was great. 

So it was weird because we were thinking our roomie was missing out on these visualizations and right was we said that she knocked on the door of our bedroom. We thought it was so crazy we had to let her in even thought we were naked under the covers.

And then we watched until the end. The song and the visualizations ended at the same time and before it did, as ""In The Pines"" by Nirvana was ending I pronounced that the visualizations were over and as I said that they both ended. It was fucking crazy.

All I kept thinking was that with B+ we separated from reality but were still in that reality floating above it. With PB it was like I got into a rocket ship and blasted myself into deep space. 

I know everyone says ""a cube is a cube"" but I am just going to have to disagree after this experience. I've taken roughly the same amount the same way with the same people and it was NOTHING like this. And it affected us all the same both times. We all thought B+ was very mellow and calm and we all were tripping balls having crazy visuals last night on PB.

I'm sorry if this has been asked 1000 times before, but I've been trying to google it for a bit but I've been smoking trees all night and I seem to be too stupid to get any answers..

I've been thinking about taking up growing again and I was wondering which type I should pick.. I've been growing Cubensis Cambodia before and had decent harvests. 

I don't really have space for a proper setup so I'm going to go with a growkit from the elephant, I've been buying from another page before so I thought I'd try this one this time. Are there any major differences on the highs you get from the different types?

They currently have;
Cambodian, B+, Mazatapec, Equador, Thai and Golden Teacher.

It may have been attempted before,LSDream,12,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1g1f2n/i_had_an_idea_that_might_make_brf_cakes_more/,"So brf has pretty shit yields, in part due to the small amount of nutrient medium the shrooms have. Too much nutrient and the jars won't colonise in time, too nutritious substrate and bacteria and mold are a problem. 

bulk teks avoid this by waiting until mycelium has a fighting chance at colonising the larger body of nutrients but as a rule require more sterile practices and spawn that is easier to fragment. 

What if after a cake was established nutrient mix was injected into the substrate? I am imagining a situation where after a flush or birthing a patch of the mycelium is swabbed and then a hypodermic used to insert a mixture of sterilised honey water. by inserting the needle at am upward angle the chance of contaminants entering and getting a foothold is fairly small, verm provides a great medium for absorbing the solution.and as the nutrient is delivered to the heart of the mycelium only your shrooms should benefit. 

afaik this hasn't been tried and documented. does anyone have any remarks? is this viable in your opinion? I am not particularly experienced in shrooming.

We were lucky that there was only one other guy there, so we pretty much had the entire campsite to ourselves. Our campsite is on a small peninsula, giving us an amazing view of the lake.  

After Mixing about 4.1g with some orange juice we start feeling the usual stomach tension. We decide we want to build a fire but instead of buying firewood from the convenience store we decide to go forage it. We start walking the trail hoping to run into some firewood. We both start tripping as we begin walking the trail. 

We found ourselves mesmerized by the beauty of everything around us. Everything was so calm and relaxing; the boats riding in the distance. The gentle wind animating the trees, and the sunshine illuminating everything. We eventually find a bench where we can sit and focus on taking everything in. 

It's at this time that we have a very honest talk about the past years of our lives and how much we've experienced since last summer. We talk about our shortcomings, our fears and our goals. Both of us did not do very well in school, so grades are definitely one of our shortcomings. We both realize that we're both guilty of not caring and somewhat wasting our lives by not living to our full potential. This conversation is very honest and positive, which leads to us not really feeling shameful about our past, but rather eager to do better in the future. 

Me personally, I realize that this past year I had not put forth 100% effort. I was not committing myself fully to what I did. I can't believe that I never noticed or realized this, but at that moment it was clear that I could give a much better in just about every aspect of life. 

At this time my mood is just extreme happiness as I am surrounded by beauty. This whole time as we're walking the trial my life feels like a Wes Anderson film, that is how pretty everything is. I realize that happiness is such a wonderful emotion. So much better than sadness or anger or boredom. I realize that I must live my life in a way I can experiences as much happiness as I can. Doing things like spending time with friends, helping people, and just being a nice person that can make others smile.

I realize that I likely won't feel as euphoric everyday as I did today. But still, I can make an effort to be happy everyday and keep a positive mindset.

Also the funniest part was that as we got off the trial the effects of the shrooms had subsided. Our trip on the trail was a literal trip.  ",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,False,,,True,t3_1fvth7,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1fvth7/best_trip_ive_ever_had/,

Before investing in a pressure cooker, I wanted to test out the hobby using as little materials as possible. All in all it was very successful. 

Had to buy jars, verm, and perlite. All totaled out to less than $40. I had a friend get me a syringe (GT) since I was a bit paranoid about it being sent to my address. Plastic bins I already had, heater and gauges I already had from aquarium hobbies and the like. 

I simply sterilized the jars in two huge pots with lids, for a bout 2.5 hours, only having to add a little bit of water twice if I recall. I let them cool for about 10 hours before moving them into a small bathroom that I had spent the previous 3 days rigorously cleaning and sanitizing, and left the door closed off until I was ready to inoculate. 

Used one syringe between 10 jars, the last jar only getting two squirts since I ran out. That last jar ended up making about 3/4 of a cake that I kept in its own section and cleaned up until it was a nice solid cake just missing a chunk. Took about 3 weeks for full colonization and then gave them a few extra days while I got things ready. I dunked for 20 hours and rolled them in verm before placing them in a typical shotgun chamber with 5"" of perlite. I have this in a smaller room with a humidifier dedicated for that room. 12/12 lighting. 

All of the cakes flushed quite nicely, I averaged ~5 grams per cake (dry, using fan for 2 days then heated Epsom salt tek). No molds, no contams, I got pretty lucky. I didn't take any photos, I'm truly paranoid about that type of thing. I was only going to snap a photo if I had a mold or issue and needed help. 

I dunked the cakes for 20 hours after the flushes, and that's where I am at now. Seeing some pinning coming along decently for these second flushes. I'm already far ahead of what I was hoping to achieve out of this. 

It helped me a lot to find people that broke down what they used and did to make things go smoothly for my own try. I figured I'd offer some extra info for anyone that wanted it. If I can help at all, lmk! I've also found that freshies are *DISGUSTING*.. It took me an hour to get over how much more intense the flavor is. I've only used dried ones in the past. 

I think I'll try for a bulk grow down the road now that I know what things look like as they grow, what to look for, and how to care for them as they grow. Typed on my phone, sorry for rambling or errors.

A few months ago I bought a syringe of psilocybe azurescens by accident.  These are a wood-loving mushroom that generally won't fruit on grain alone.

First of all, I've had the spores in my fridge (unopened package) for about 6 months.  So right there, my expectations are low.

I found this very helpful guide:  http://www.fungifun.org/English/Psilocybe-Azurescens-Outdoor-Cultivation

I thought about it for a while and decided; what the hell?  I bought a three pound pre-sterilized bag of sawdust with a rye pocket.  It arrived today, and I sterilized the needle and injector site, then inoculated the rye pocket with the full syringe.

It's starting to get warm here, but I have it in a box in the coolest room in the house.  Should stay within 70-85f for the next month at least.  I'm still waiting for my new fancy thermometer.

I'll keep y'all updated, after colonization I plan to make an outdoor woodchip bed for fruiting in the fall.

Any advice or experience much appreciated.

I grew my own mushrooms, harvesting 39g of fresh, drying it in from of my cool air conditioner for 48 hours, then struck it in a tupperware container for 2 days with 8 ounces of damp-rid. This resulted in 2.2 g of very very dry shrooms. I ground them up in a blender, added it to very warm water, about 120 degrees F for 45 minutes with a squeeze of lemon and a squirt of honey. I drank the tea and all i got was nausea, a heavy feeling, and giggles. No visuals, no color enhancement. No wider music. No euphoria.  As you can see I did everything to oreserve potency, with cool drying, cool brewing and eating them 4 days after picking. 
Any idea what went wrong? I have read that 2g should be enough for a good firat trip. Should i eat more next time, maybe 4g? 
Set and setting was my house by myself. Any advice would be appreciated. I am harvesting anither batch soon and would like the next time to be better.

Picked up an 8th and saw that as being a good start between two people. I had been reading up on how to take them, how long they last, and effects at different levels but other then that I was ready...kinda. 

It was about 11pm when we arrived at our destination amongst some college bleachers but my friend got nervious since she had never done them before so she wanted me to take my half first to see what it be like. After about half an hour of consuming my portion with some M&amp;Ms we saw no change, and she said I should just take the whole thing... so I did. We left our seats and decided to just go about walking the campus and streets that lay in front of us. 

Half was into the walk we ended up by a tree nursery that was on a very dimly lit street which made the night sky the most spectacular back drop that triggered the biggest smile on my face. I began telling her that I loved how she painted because that was her mind setting forward an image to share with the world. Then I got into the idea that she not obey street signs when they have no rule over us. Slowly the other portion I took was sinking in.

We entered a very dark street covered in the shade of trees which is where I believe my trip peaked. Within the shade of the night sky I began wanting to tell her how the night felt like my home, how I was a backstage producer who loved to see others shine in the light of life. It is then that I began to feel my body vibrate and my self awareness highten as if I went in the back seat of my mind. Here is when I saw her shine in a briliant beam of orange light and I had to tell her how she became the most beautiful image ive ever seen. She was taken back but that was the first of many things that just pulled her back into knowing I was on my trip. I told her we had to sit because my mind was full of things to say, about how I felt my life had been in a state of pause and now the mushrooms had triggered me to play. Spheres this and spheres that I would say trying to get ideas out of how everything is a cycle and our lives had already been lived. We needed to get away from time to venture forward, but our bodys needed to remain in the physical realm to express love, because everything is love. 

I even had a flash back from being on the said street once before but there were signs I had to see and for some reason the idea of a fish came to mind, did I know why... no.. but I was pissed that I saw none. This got me onto thinking about God, Jesus Fish, and phish. I stayed away from the concepts for as long as I could but then I began to hate time again, until I understood time as the universes piece of paper. You cant share every idea the way we could if we were telepathic, and so with our limitations we need time (paper) to share our ideas (dreams). 

Further down the street I thought of myself as a needle on a record player, and every person was a needle playing a note on the giant record that is our planet earth. Each soul depending on where it is in time and physical space plays an alternative tune. When we are in love we are two needles that have found a melody that plays what the other is missing and there are our linkages. Just then I bagan to look at her face and see the dual visions but I also had that sense of when you stare at yourself in the mirror and see other versions of yourself, I felt as though I was taking in all of who she was.

Further still, we made our way to some post office and this is where I told her we are all God. Every one of us is that record of history, love, and spirit and we are all connected. Then the concept of adam and eve came into play. I thought women could not understand what a man could. That because she was created of a rib all she knew was beauty, and I could not create anything more beautiful then her. After that I remember referencing lennon and yoko, but its all fuzzy in my memory. I do recall tossing my glasses to the floor and saying i did not need them, as well as wanting to talk to a gentlemen cleaning the streets at what was now sometime round 3am.

Once we continued back to the car I really lost it. I felt like time no longer exsisted as I hated it so much. I felt like she had to leave me behind because all that was left was me making my moves forward. Every place around me was the same and nothing mattered but going forward. She would not leave me so she physically had to put me in the car. ""Do you want to go home"" she asked... ""I want to die"" I said. 

The whole drive back I kept closing my eyes and seeing hexagons of a raindow tint pusing, and having myself tell her to fuck me over and over again. I almost just took my seatbelt off and jumped on her while she was on the freeway. I black out then until we arrived at her house where I was at my end. Every time I began to want to share some idea I had in my head she would try to quite me down or cover my eyes and I felt that it was no longer her there protecting me but some outside force was holding my awakening from taking place and I began to cry. She finally got me inside her home and layed me down.

In her bed I bagan to try to communicate to all those I had lost in my past telepathically. My father, my missing dog, an old friend, and a former flaim all in there respective times. The last one was me asking for my brother in which at the same time she had called him on my phone. His voice brought my comfort back and I slowly began to realize where I was and what I had been doing. I felt so out of it, and to make things worse, in my fury of just moving forward and go go go mentality I pissed myself on her bed :/ .... 

I had kept my friend up for hours on end and when I finally asked what time it was 7am had just hit. So with all of this I will just learn to control my dosage next time and really just grab a grip on reality. I honestly felt in control of the cosmos but when you wake up pissed....  you know you were just tripping.

TL;DR
I, a backstage introvert, began to imagine what the world should be like, went mildly crazy, and crated a concept of God that empowers me and everyone around me.

[First harvest(part of)](http://i.imgur.com/sjNjU)

I actually took a timelapse from start till first harvest, someday I'll buckle down and combine it. Anyway, first real harvest was about 130g wet, dried down to 7g. 

I'm at what I'd probably say is the happiest I've ever been in my life (awesome job/girlfriend/everything) so I was not scared at all and took 3.5g. I'm ~170lbs male. My girlfriend (100lbs), who had tried shrooms once before, took 2.5g.

Here's the extremely short version of what happened: 2 hours in I was feeling pretty ""jolly"" and ""light"" but that's about it. My girlfriend was tripping balls. I decided to smoke smoke weed as I was somewhat disappointed. I'm not certain of what effects it had but if I had to use one word to describe the night it would be ""extreme concentration"" and raised senses. My vision was perfect, in fact it was better than perfect. The only thing I noticed was that if I stared at something the surroundings would wobble a little bit, and light exposure was sometimes a bit weird. I felt like a ""superhuman"" all around. 

At one point I talked to my GF (who I don't think had any idea what I was saying) for what felt like an eternity on one specific subject without drifting off at all, extremely fast. Things turned pretty sour after that, I felt like I had overloaded my brain (I was thinking realllly hard about the things I was talking about) and body and became extremely ""brain tired""(head kind of hurt when thinking ""deep"" but I couldn't stop thinking) and felt like I was getting a cold/sore throat (from all the talking?), which of course led into the whole ""I'm going to die, go insane, never going to return to normal blah blah"", there's a lot of detail missing here because it would take 2 pages to explain the reasoning behind it. Anyway. Things obviously returned to normal the next day.

After mulling this over for a few days, and tending to my second flush, I decided I wanted to try it again, knowing what I then knew (I'm not going to die) and without smoking weed. Second flush only produced 2.5g dried which I took. The experience was similar (without the panic), I had EXTREME concentration and was not distracted by anything. I tried really hard to ""let go"" and had mild success staring at dots on the floor, with things ""wobbling"" considerably more than before but that's that. I tried sensory deperavation (earplugs, dark room) and had no success. I definitely felt ""weird"" and again ""light"", and extremely relaxed physically and concentrated mentally. In fact I laid in bed for at least 3 hours trying to sleep without any luck because I just couldn't stop thinking. Finally fell asleep at around 5am, took shrooms at 9pmish.

So I'm wondering... Wtf? Where are my awesome visuals and ""trips""? :P And from what I've read, one should barely be able to hold a coherent thought for the most part, let alone feeling like I should get to work and bang out some code (I'm a programmer) like never before. 

I don't know if this is related, but I'm going to add it anyway. I have been smoking weed for, wow, I guess it's almost been a year now. On and off. At first, it was the typical weed experience. Munchies and uncontrolable lolz. Then in the last 2-3 months it's started drifting towards the same type of hyper concentration that I experienced on shrooms. In fact, this entire grow was completed while high, and I couldn't have done it this well sober. 

Do I just need.. more?

What I'm also interested in knowing is whether there is a relation between high from weed and ""high"" from shrooms? Because it felt very similar to me, just much more intense.

However, I'd really appreciate any input you guys could give me.

I've smoked my fair share of marijuana and loved it, if only for how it's made me look at life and how it's enlightened me. I look at things from other perspectives now I would've never considered 2 years ago. I haven't smoked in about 4 months, preparing for job interviews and drug tests. 

I've read so much about not taking psychadelics if you're in a bad state of mind. I'm graduating college soon, have been stressed about finding a job and how my relationship with my girlfriend will be affected with me moving away. Just generally a bit depressed that this stage of my life is ending and feeling like I have somewhat wasted my time/youth worrying about things that don't really matter. 

Plain and simiple, I really want to take mushrooms before I graduate. I've done my research on them and am coming into the situation with an open mind and truly think I will enjoy the experience, almost like it'd be beneficial in a sense. Should I still continue with my plan to take mushrooms or is this only going to end badly for me?

Edible strains are often found in lotions and acne medicine.,MEW5,13,5,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/123osh/do_psychoactive_shrooms_have_a_positive_effect/,"The thought just struck me.  I like to study drugs, especially psychoactives and their potential.  I've read of people having success taking small pre-threshold doses (say a pinch off a stem the size of a centimeter) daily in regards to depression or headaches.  

Anecdotally- have any of you that partake in shrooms often noticed any effect on your skin? 

Scientifically- it makes sense that it would be effective, but in what doses?  How would  you figure that out?  

Experimentation- I have a friend who has been having severe bouts of acne for the last few months.  She is the sort that would likely agree to this, since it's not tested for and would not affect her job.  If you took a small pre-threshold dose daily, or a small to medium trip once a month for a while, do you think it would have any effect on skin condition?

I'm curious and if this sounds plausible I'd like to broach it with her and send her some so that we can test it.  I'll be seeing her over Christmas (perfect time for clearer skin) and we can discuss the effects she's seen.  I'd like to eventually write a paper on my findings.

Any advice? 


**edit- Apparently in the scientific community it's standard to mock someone for asking questions instead of pointing them in the right direction.  I hope your epenises feel nice and big right now.  Next time I would suggest that instead of making someone wish they hadn't asked for more understanding on a subject, you actually do the proper thing and use your massive educations and huge, fluffy brains to help them learn from their naivete.

They arrived I went through the process of innoculation and incubation, but no mycelium ever grew. I sterilized the substrate for 90 min in a pressure cooker. From there I transfered the jars still in the cooker to my sterile room. It is a 3x3 room constructed out of taped-together trashbags in the corner of my house. I did this a week prior to beginning the innoculating process. I taped it to ensure that there aren't any air leaks and I sprayed it down with lysol a day before and also 30 mins before i actually used it. (used half a can in that sucker) Inside the room, i followed the pf tek process for innoculating the jars. After every 3 jars I heated up the end of the needle until it was red hot and waited a couple of seconds before i continued innoculating. After i finished with all of them I placed them in one of those tupperware 60qt tubs. That was within another tub that was filled with water and had a aquarium heater that kept the water at 76F. I left it there only occasionally looking at it, but nothing ever grew for a month. Not even signs of mold. I'm not sure what I did wrong. 

I did the same thing now, but not focusing as much as i did before on sterilizing. Its only been 4 days, and there aren't any signs of growth. I know it takes about a week in some cases, but I can't help but feel a bit afraid. 


UPDATE: 3/15/2011

So right after replying to runningscared's post I checked my jars and saw signs of growth. This means that the spore syringes from the first batch (not this one) were bunk spores. I got them from sporestore.com. They are the reason why I saw no signs of growth from my first batch of jars. DON'T BUY FROM SPORESTORE.COM!!!

They were growing during a rainy - gloomy period, but this week has been sunny and apparently it dried up most of the older fruiting bodies.

They were growing along a wood chip path. In a garden in the PNW.

The wavy caps seem like *P. cyanescens* but I have **no** idea what the bigger mushrooms are.

SPORE PRINTS will be done at the earlier at 1:26PM. I tested the smallest, largest, and mid sized caps from each mushroom group.

If so, I'd appreciate some help.",shroomiethrowaway,8,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1chqtq/are_identifications_of_shrooms_allowed_here_if_so/,"Hi there. First off, I'd like to make note of the fact that I'm a complete newbie at this so I apologize in advance if my questions are dumb, the mushrooms I picked are completely wrong, or if I've wasted your time. I did what I believe to be basic research from shroomery.org to know what to look for, but I'm not necessarily confident in my abilities (considering this is my first foray into trying to harvest these things). I understand that trying to identify mushrooms in this medium isn't reliable, but I suppose it's worth a shot.

Anyways.

Some information about where these mushrooms were picked and the weather conditions today to a few days prior along with some pictures. I tried to capture the top of the cap, the underside of the cap, and the stems. 

####Location

I live in Lafayette, Louisiana. Or if you would like me to be more general, I live in the region known as Acadiana. See [map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Acadiana_parishes_map.png) for reference.

Getting into specifics, I live on a farm with considerable pastured areas that house a good amount of cows. They poop a lot. Now, I had read that cow patties were a possible source for psilocybin mushrooms. Most sources seemed to corroborate this. I picked the mushrooms from a patty that was in the process of decomposing, if that's relevant at all.

####Weather

It rained for quite a bit on Thursday, Saturday, and Monday. The ground was still wet when I went out and there were a few pools of water in uneven areas of the field.

####Pictures

I tried my best to get a clear pictures that captured anything important. If the pictures are of poor quality or not useful I apologize.

[Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/dAVMwAv.jpg) and [Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/vAaWsvs.jpg)

You'll notice some of them are crushed a bit. After picking them I put them in my pocket and went to herd cattle (seriously). That's why they got smushed. 

Now according to [this](http://www.shroomery.org/8461/Which-psilocybin-mushrooms-grow-wild-in-my-area) the mushrooms that grow wild in my area are:

#

* Gymnopilus junonius

* Panaeolus cinctulus

* Panaeolus cyanescens

* Psilocybe caerulescens

* Psilocybe cubensis

I looked up pictures of these for comparison, and I wasn't very encouraged. Maybe P. cubensis or P. cyanescens, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's just a common mushroom, who knows?

Anyways, thanks in advance for any helpful and informative comments.

I didn't have any H202 on hand, so I used a 1:10 bleach/water solution and sprayed the corner thoroughly. The substrate had already come off the wall of the monotub and I could see the mold had progressed down the sides, so misted the gap between the monotub wall and substrate quite thoroughly as well. 

So far it's been 36 hours or so since the mold first appeared, and the existing patch has not progressed. Nor has any mold shown up elsewhere so far. First flush is drawing to a close, but there are still a healthy mushrooms coming up.

In the drying process, they did become green-blueish. However, the tint went away when they were completely dried. Definitely hygrophanous.

Location: Nanaino, Vancouver Island. Found it on some cut grass patch of a private company on the side of the highway. It grew mostly in groups of about 10-15. Found about 3 patches of them.

I did not know you couldn't take a spore print once mushrooms are dried, unfortunately. However, I do know that the color on the veil is caused by the falling of spores, and not bruising. So we could possibly consider that as a spore print. Which would mean ""Dark Blue"". From what I remember seeing as a deposit in the coffee filter when I was drying, ""greyish"" could describe the spore print as well.

[Trip Report]",champinonesmagicales,8,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/13hsqx/my_thoughts_about_the_other_side_trip_report/,"So I have been experimenting with different ways of consumption of this wonderful fungus. I am finding my preferred method as of yet to be chopping up fresh mushrooms, making a tea and adding lemon juice and organic honey. This tea begins to take effect in about 20-30 mins depending on stomach contents. 

So last night I birthed some jars and 8 out of 10 of the jars had began to [fruit prematurely](http://i.imgur.com/WHe7Y.jpg) in the jar. Dunking these cakes would kill the premature fruits so I harvested them and they weighed out to 11 grams wet weight. 

I prepared them as described above not expecting anything to really happen. I have never dosed so low before but then again they were fresh and taken as tea so I really didn't know what to expect.
My gf and I went to see our favorite local band and I wasn't feeling much of anything but then again I just had 3 pieces of pizza and a salad, but after about 35 mins that I noticed that old familiar foreign feeling. For 2 hours we watched 2 bands (felt like 4 hours) but I found myself unable to focus on the music. Instead I was incredibly interested in what was going on in the crowd. I caught myself staring at couple and I was extremely curious about their interactions. I was really keyed in to those around me. A girl shaking and bouncing to the music who I KNEW was on some substance (coke or speed) because I was on a substance. 

I found myself hyper attracted to females. I didn't want to do anything with these girls. The attraction was not sexual in any way but I just wanted to stare and take them all in. It was at this point I thought that I was a total creeper.

Everyone in the crowd seemed to be a TV/movie character of some sort. Probably because it was a rockabilly show but I thought everyone was so theatrical, they were all playing a part.
Perhaps the most profound (and admittedly bizarre) thought I kept having was that I did not grow mushrooms for myself but the mushrooms were using me to manifest their effects. They needed me to grow and consume them. They did not exist for my enjoyment but rather I existed so they could survive and be consumed. I kept feeling as if I was on a separate layer of reality that was pulling away from actual reality. It felt as if I was from another universe observing the people of this universe. If anyone has ever watch the tv show 'Fringe' I would say I felt a lot like 'an observer.' That there were 2 universes and mushrooms were the key to visit the other side. This is when I came up with the theory that the show Fringe is actually based on a psychedelic trip. Walter is constantly referencing LSD and in the last season we discovered a parallel universe where everything was the same but slightly different. 
I came home after and played with my dog, laughing at her funny faces and went to bed watching [electric sheep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVD67pMdv9k) and listening to [dark Side of the Moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=328WhjAXpcs).

All in all I was extremely surprised the effect of 11 grams fresh had on me. It was extremely profound and controlled. Except at the beginning when it my chest was heavy and I thought I may have been poisoned.

Instances 1-4 and 6 were 3g dosages and 5 was a 6g dose. I had a typically awesome experience with fun visuals for each except for the 6g dosage. Things got pretty screwy at that point. This is where I need help to figure out exactly what my brain was doing.

It was initially a fun trip, I felt awesome, happier and more at one with the world than I had ever been before. I was with good company and was looking at the vibrant colors that nature had to offer through my shroomin' eyes. It was awesome. And then something odd happened. About 3 hours into the trip, I couldn't hear myself speak English. I would talk to my friends and they would understand me, but I wouldn't understand myself. It's like when you tell someone that you're going to the bathroom. They hear you say ""I'm going to the bathroom"" and you hear your own voice say the same thing. However, when I told them ""I'm going to the bathroom"", I heard my own voice say some type of absolute gibbrish. It wasn't a language that exists but rather it was completely made up and composed of random sounds and words that I've heard or said throughout my life, even going as far as syllables of some words being combined with others to create new ones. The only way I knew that I wasn't quite going crazy was that I had to be certain in what I was saying. Even though I wouldn't hear myself saying ""I'm going to the bathroom"", based on how my friends reacted to what I said, I could figure out that I was, in fact, still speaking English in the real world. This occurred for the rest of my trip off and on. Sometimes I would be like that for an hour or sometimes it would flash on and off every 5 or so minutes. When the trip was over, I could say that I was kind of relieved because it sorta freaked me out. This happened in the summer towards the end of July. 

Flashforward:

Last night was my first time doing shrooms since the 6g dosage. I did 3g because I didn't want to have the same effects as last time. However, a couple of hours again the same thing occurred but to a far lesser extent. It only happened a couple of times and would only last for a maximum of 1 minute, otherwise it would just sneak itself into my conversations for a second and confuse the shit out of me. But then it got weirder. It invaded my thoughts. I couldn't understand the ideas that were formulated in my head because I heard them in a mix of this gibbrish and sound effects. I would think ""Man, these stars look radical,"" but in my head I would hear ""kingluxen something seomthing (mario coin pickup sound)."" Again, it didn't last long, but it was still strange. Thankfully I wasn't freaked out because this had happened before, but I was still wondering why and how this was happening.

Any ideas as to what this occurrence is?

I'm planning on using the pf tek videos to grow.

here are my questions:  
1) My local shop has a few different spores in, B+, Amazon, Ecuador, they had a few more but I didn't catch the names (Golden teacher was one of them but that was sold out), all of these were in 10cc syringes. Is any strain easier to grow than another? Is any strain noticeably more potent?  
2) Like I said, it's a 10cc syringe. How many cakes will this cover? Just 1? 2? One thing I noticed in the videos is they never said how much of the stuff to inject. I was planning on getting 2 or 3 syringes, so 20-30cc's, will this give me mushrooms coming out the ass?  
3) If I have a big pot and boil the jars as seen in the pf tek vids is this sufficient? I don't have a pressure cooker / canner and if I don't have to spend the money on it I'd rather not..but if it produces noticeably better results I'll buy it.  
4) I only live in a basement apartment, as such there is a lot of humidity and I have a dehumidifier, how much will this affect the process?

This is the kit I used, nothing amazing, but should get the job done.

Now, I didn't really do this too well, I screwed up the injecting, it's a long story which I will shorten, but I'm worried I've wasted my spores..

You see on the first step, where I was supposed to inject in the four corners? Well I didn't know I was supposed to pierce through the plastic and so took the entire lid off (which is there for birthing) and injected that way, then I swabbed the lid with an alcohol wipe and put it back on.

The syringe was also blocked, and so stupidly I used my nail to unblock it (I had washed my hands, but still) , and then swabbed the needle again and injected (I had shaken the syringe before and after this affair).

The thing was exposed for a long time, about 4 minutes, I did swab the whole thing with the alcohol wipe but am afriad that was probably not enough?

Also, I injected way more spores that I was supposed to, in more than four spots. I injected all the way 'round in a non-uniform manner in a rush, and ended up using the same amount of spores that should do three kits, for one.

I've made this account so I could ask for help from the community. 

I'm trying for a B+ growth. It began as a PF tek, which started off fine. The jars inoculated with no sign of contamination. However, when I went to pop the cakes out of the jars, I realized I made a rookie mistake - my jars were shouldered. The cakes weren't coming out, so they ended up getting broken up on their way out.

I read somewhere that you can just take these broken up cakes, and add it to a coir-verm mix and bulk spawn. So I broke up my cakes and put them into coir-verm mix and waited. A little bit of mycelium growth, but nothing major. The condition hasn't really changed in 2 weeks, and I'm wondering if I've passed the point of no return. Should I scrap what I have now and try again in the future? 

Here is an[ imgur album with examples of the coir tubs](http://imgur.com/a/rhrlg). You can see that there are big white clumps. Those are the original pieces of cakes that I broke into the coir mix. I think they've gotten bigger, but clearly there isn't a real network of mycelium being formed. 

So basically I'm stuck and don't know what to do. The longer I wait, the more likely it is that the containers get contaminated. Has anyone experienced something like this before? Any advice would be appreciated.

As I said above, I'm about to do my first growth. Since it's a couple month long process I want to try and do it right the first time. 

Having read some pretty good things about them (and to further simplify the process since it's my first time), I am going to get a couple [mad bags](http://themadseason.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=17) instead of going PF tek. I'm going to do a whole growth (at least up to fruiting) in one bag, then use the rest in an attempt to spawn to a monotub. (edit to clarify: I'm hedging my bets and going to take one mad bag and do the whole process as outlined on their website, possibly relocating it after the first picking. The rest of the bags I'm going to use as media to spawn to bulk)

Here's the layout I'm planning on following for the bulk:
Innoc 2-3 mad bags
Wait until the bags are 100% colonized (going to just follow the mad bag instructions until I switch to bulk)
Wait another week (is this step necessary if you're spawning to bulk, or just if you're planning on fruiting from the bag?)
Prepare coir (http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/11916595#11916595)
Prepare monotob (http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/14649819)
Place in 12/12 light, mist 2-3 times a day, fan 4-5 times a day, wait until they're ready to pick.

So my questions are:
Will 3 mad bags be enough to create spawn for a 30 qt tote like [this](http://www.target.com/p/rubbermaid-revelations-30-qt-latching-tote-purple/-/A-14051274#?lnk=sc_qi_detaillink)?
Can the mad bags even be used to spawn to bulk? I assume they can since I've read that you can do this with PF tek cakes; I don't see why it would be different.
The aforementioned ""Is this step necessary?"" 
How do you do flushes with a monotub? Or is it more of a ""one and done"" thing?
And did I miss anything else?

I'll mist 3 times a day, or when I see humidity start to drop-- and I fan about 5 times a day.

Other advanced stuff...,suffragettecity,9,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/11u11u/upgrades_on_the_pf_tek_spawning_to_bulk_and_using/,"Lots of people spawn to bulk and I think it has to do with more square inches which seems to produce more fruit. Many people also use grain in their jars instead of brown rice flour.  Also, lots of people use grains. Why grains? It has to do with inoc points and the distribution of mycelium. After you colonize a grain jar, you can shake it to distribute the mycelium and get the remaining uncolonized grains to do the shroom dance. 

Why is the pf tek so slow? Well, because the mycelium has to get through a somewhat dense mass of brown rice and vermiculite... compared to getting through airy grains. Not to say that it is bad! you can still mix your crushed up cake into a substrate... we'll talk about that later.  

What is spawning to bulk? Well, it is mixing your spawn with a substrate which is a fancy word for a soil-like mass! In other words, something like horse manure and hay, or coco coir and vermiculite which after pasteurization (you can either do it or not depending on your type of substrate) you add your spawn to. 

I see a lot of threads here about the PF Tek and they are all good and everything, but damn does that Brown Rice Flour colonize ever slowly. However that all depends on genetics, sterile procedures, whether or not you are using multispore or a liquid culture, incubation temps, Relative Humidity.

Now that I mentioned Liquid Culture... I should say that if you buy spore syringes off the internet, this is a good way to increase the amount of inoculant that you have. If you inject a spore syringe into a nutrient sugar water (there are many recipes for this, water must be sterile) a liquid mat of mycelium will form in the water and then you can shake up the jar with the liquid in it and suck it up into a sterile syringe and then put it into jars. 

Some people also use agar (many recipes, remember the difference between food grade agar and laboratory agar is that food grade agar has preservatives)... why? Because lets say that you go in the wild and find one of those liberty caps you are all talking about... you can spore print it, then pour agar plates, then take your spores from your prints and transfer them to your agar, then once the agar is colonized, you can cut wedges of the agar and transfer that to grains. Instead of making a spore syringe from your wild print, you can get it to colonize on agar and if say the agar has contaminates, you can carefully cut away the healthy mycelium from the contaminated stuff and then try with another plate to see if you can isolate the good stuff from the bad. 

Also I should say, that if you want to go deeper into this hobby, you should probably invest in a pressure cooker and learn how to use it. They're really not that hard. Any way, I just wanted to spread some knowledge. 

Here are some good OMC's that I like to use

shroomery.org
mycotopia.net
myco-tek.org
 
And remember, this stuff is not hard if you do your research. Also, remember to try and keep spore vendors off of your keyboard. We don't want them to get linked to illegal activity, which is not what I am talking about at all.

A few months ago I took shrooms for the first time, I took an eighth,diced up in orange juice, with no trip sitter, while watching an Alan Watts lecture on my 60 inch tv. I'm pretty sure I got to experience ego death, and the next day I started reading about production. I've decided me and these shrooms are going to be best friends forever.

I ordered some spores, and I found I really enjoy the process and reading all the different ways of doing things. I've currently got a damian5050 WBS monotub fruiting in the garage, 10 quart jars innoculating, and 30 more to noc up next time the wife heads out for an entire day.

I've been extremely discrete, but I don't think it's feasible for me to keep production running under her nose, and my kiddo should be learning to talk soon, so I plan on producing a metric fuckton this summer, and discretely storing for as long as possible. 

Here's the methods I've found so far that appeal to me to me.

Dried soaked in everclear(151) 24 hours, twice, fan reduced to 2 grams per mil then potency halved with more everclear(the fan lowers the alcohol content) and stashed in a pint jar in the freezer with no oxygen. 

Dried, capsuled, stashed in a dark room temperature closet with O2 obsorbers.

Powderd, bagged, o2 obsorbers and frozen.

Mixed into hot honey, twice, removed, stored at room temperature with no oxygen.


Any of you folks have a favorite stashing method you could share? ",,False,self,t5_2s3yi,False,,,True,t3_1i726x,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/1i726x/i_have_some_awesome_problems_tips_for_storage/,

Tl;dr. Good trip, small dose, Hearing songs that don't exist, would do again.

So a bit of backstory. I was raised religious and anti-drug, began with trees in college, and for a few years now have not gone more than a few days without trees. I was never interested in hallucinogens due mainly to ignorance, and also that I don't trust ""man-made"" drugs. So after I tried some Changa, my eyes were more open and I became interested in Shrooms.

Even though there are plenty of cows, and the occasional hard storm, no one ever seem to have any though. Finally I got about 2 grams (a little under probably) of Albino P.E. that I split with my significant other of the time. I remember enjoying my video game more, and combining it with trees made trees seem brand new, but i didn't get what I was expecting from shrooms

Flash forward to yesterday. I didn't plan on taking them when I woke up, but at about 5, I decided I may as well. I ate a gram, and put on the regular show for an hour as they started to kick in. I just ate them plain, no tek, slightly empty stomach. Regular show got abnormally funnier than usual, even episodes I had already saw before. (I didn't giggle barely at all the entire trip though). I'm starting to feel it as I puff on some trees, and decide to eat another dose... about .75. And it starts to kick in. I watch my cat, and when she breathes I see each individual hair reflect the light. I watched them all move in unison, yet separate from each other. The shadows started breathing, and I decided to see what it was like outside.

I'm an art major, and I couldn't believe the color. The sun set was beautiful with blue and purple melting into orange., the trees were so sharp, and everywhere I looked my thought was ""That is art"" just that everything could have been its own piece of work, just pure beauty. Was so cool

Now a third thing, and this is something I'm interested in hearing about from others is what I refer to as ""Multi-track Processing"". Which is having different ""trains"" of thought going on at the same time. I was analyzing what I was seeing, making notes of my surroundings, my cat, I could read from my phone, and at the same time, i was hearing music. Not like melodys, or piano, but I was listening to songs that I both knew, and had never heard before. they had words, drums, guitar. One of the songs was actually screamo, and I was in the middle of texting when i couldn't stop myself. Out of nowhere I start singing the song. which amounted to me halway yelling, ""ahhhhh Here comes the break-down"" then moving around (dancing) to the accompanying guitar and drum. And the omnidirectional thoughts persisted throughout.

I ended up eating another .75 around 7:30, for a total of 2.5 grams.

I didn't have any auditory or visual hallucinations, as far as I can tell, but did have a very enjoyable trip. The shrooms ended rather uncomfortably on my stomach, so I think I'll try the lemon tek next time, as well as upping my dose.

My only complaint is that, although not hung over, I do feel rather drained, which is understandable. it just feels like I got a shit night of sleep haha.

Side note, anyone know about shrooms and dreams? I don't normally have/remember my dreams. But when I woke up this morning was much more sweaty than I have been. Perspiration from being scared in dreams? Or something else.

The stem is hollow and has a bit of striations around the outside.


Spore print is light brown. This is in northeastern US. I've heard the manure was from pigs but can't confirm that. The smell is unremarkable. I can also examine other features if anyone has followup questions. It seems like the caps start out concave and then turn up with age. The gills also start out a lighter beige turning brown with age. I didn't pick any of the largest ones. The big one in the bottom photo is probably 3 inches across.

I feel bulk substrates are easy enough to perform, however no matter how much I look there's holes in the steps. I'm clarifying the steps so that contaminations and mistakes can be avoided. (All these are shortened obviously)

1. Prepare spawn by using WBS, Popcorn, etc using the proper Tek for it. Sterilize it and innoculate. Shake every 4-5 days and wait till fully colonized.

2. Prepare a substrate by mixing coir and vermiculite (I was thinking Damion5050's tek) making sure it's at field capacity and not super wet. 

3. Prepare the tub by sanitizing it, and laying it with a black trash bag, also sanitized. Poke holes throughout the tub for FAE and fill with micropore tape or polyfill / tyvek. Put spawn and substrate into tub and mix. Add casing layer of DRY vermiculite. Then change temperature to 76f~.

4. Let it grow without fanning / misting unless needed otherwise.

I've never previously used any psychedelics, but after reading about the transcendent, meaningful experiences that people have, I've been dying to try it myself.

Someone who isn't me did a grassroots operation, small-scale PF tek. Many hours of research and TLC. Only yielded a small flush from 3 jars before succumbing to a trich problem, but figured it was enough to give a taste (9g dried in a Nesco dehydrator) while the next batch colonizes.

So two weeks ago was my first try. I crunched 2g straight up and waited... and felt n.o.t.h.i.n.g. No effects. I was kind of bummed, but I knew it was a low-end starter dose and I supposed more would be appropriate.

So yesterday was going to be my day. I ate sparingly to keep my stomach mostly empty; my last meal was half a meager peanut butter sandwich, string cheese and a few carrot sticks at about 1:00pm. At 6:00pm I made tea with 3.4g, mostly caps. I boiled water, poured a cup onto the finely minced shrooms, let it steep for 10 minutes, strained and sipped. Then I did a second infusion, which I drank and then ate the solids, just in case to avoid missing any goodies.

The effects? ... :/

I felt:

* mild body high

* enhanced mood, sometimes giggly

* seemingly increased visual acuity

* somewhat clumsy

* at peak (around 7:30pm), slight shimmery glow around edges of objects (eg. outline of door)

NO ""breathing"", trails, CEVs, or emotional profundity. Setting shouldn't have been an issue, just hanging out in my apartment with my boyfriend to supervise.

I suffer from [Cluster Headaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache) and a proven medicine for this is psilocybin. So i've been eating Psilocybe Semilanceata given to me by very nice friends. I was going to pick some myself this autumn to get me through the winter but i failed miserably with the mission.

My friends doesn't do shrooms anymore, that's why they gave them free of charge to me. So now i'm without medicine and I don't have anyone to help me but myself. 

So my solution is quite simply to start growing myself. 


Sorry for the long intro, but here's my question:

I'm going to try growing some Cubensis using the PF TEK method listed in the sidebar. I'm a total newbie and notorious for killing plants, even cactuses so I want to do this right, every step of the way. 

I understand that a completely sterile enviroment is recommended for growing and here is where the problem lies. My wife and I have two small dogs that shed hair like crazy. Does this mean that I am screwed from the get go and should give up? Exactly how sterile is ""sterile"" when it really comes down to it? The only room i can keep dog free is a very small room where we keep cleaning supplies and the vacuum cleaner. 
It will suffice for storage when all the work has been done but I can not do the work itself in there. 

Suggestions, help and name calling is welcome! Thanks!

**Edit:**

Thanks for all your replies. Sounds like i'm good to go! All i need is to get all the equipment needed, will take some research to find the right kind of equipment since i am located in Sweden and jars etc isn't namned the same as in the guide. And get my hands on a spore print somehow.
I will do a follow up post when all this is taken care of and the magic has begun.

Advice welcome,anorabl,5,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/shroomers/comments/zmdt5/wondering_if_this_would_give_me_a_good_startup/,"My first idea was to get one of those kits in a box that you water and let grow.  Honestly I know the pros and cons of it but the convenience and small footprint was a huge deciding factor for me.  However, they don't ship to the US so I'm stuck.

I'm not very trustful of myself to get the process right (even with as much time as I've spent reading all these subreddits and several forums, including shroomery, and watching videos).  I have the basic process in my head, but I'm still a huge novice when it comes to anything plants or fish, and I'd like to start out in a way that I won't mentally overwhelm myself.  


So I was wondering if a good middle ground would be this- I'm looking for golden teacher, because of a few  factors.  One being the supposed intensity of mental learning and of visuals.  Two being ease of cultivation (though I know it's a slow starter).  


I found on ebay this product ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/Magic-Mountain-Mushroom-Grain-spawn-6-lbs-grow-bag-kit-/170595313683?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item27b845e813 )- it comes in three varieties- rye berries mushroom spawn, multi grain mushroom spawn, and Compost Mushroom Growing Substrate (though it says to use one of the first two varieties if I ""plan to start from a spore solution or liquid culture syringe"").  They come in 1lb, 5/6lb, 10lb packs, and honestly I'm not sure of a few things.


*what size bag i need per syringe I buy (would a one-pound bag and one syringe be a good mix, or would I need multiple syringes per that amount?  what about a larger bag, how many syringes?  etc)

*am I missing anything, or is it just buy the bag, buy the syringe of choice, dose/reseal and wait to open the bag again once I see pins?

*would a one lb bag and one syringe make multiple flushes?  would it make more sense to buy a 5 or 10 lb bag, and if so how many syringes?

*would it make sense to buy multiple smaller bags and make different cultures with the same or different syringe types?

*would the rye berry or the grain substrate be a better choice, or does it really matter? and why does the seller state that it is best to use one of those types instead of the compost variety when using prints or syringes?

*after a harvest would I want to dunk it somehow, or just let it be and see what continues to grow?


The brand has a very high rating (Positive Feedback:  100%
Feedback score:  2174) so I'm not worried there.


I'm basically hoping to get the hang of things this way, and then build up my confidence to make my own setup.  I also live in a small apartment with pets and occasional inspections, so discretion is key.  


Thanks for any and all advice, please note that a)I know growing completely from scratch is best, I'm asking about this method on purpose.

It was just an idea at the time because we just moved up to Ohio and didn't really know anyone. But the couple of frients I did know, I asked around, and there was really nothing around. 

Flash forward to 2 weeks ago, I was listening to a podcast and it was all about their trip, then separate podcast had a discussion about them. In total 4 different podcasts had mushrooms as their topic, so I decided I needed to find some. 

I sent out texts to my friends, one friends guy just start his batch so it would be some time, but other friend texted back with a cryptic text, it said, ""maybe, come over and we can talk"". I figured it was just a paranoia thing.

I go over, turns out he actually had 9 grams of lab with him. So needless to say I bought them.

The trip is scheduled for memorial day weekend because my Gf works weekends and she will be off. I just simply would like to thank the universe for helping things along.

Cubes. We each took a dose of about 4 grams each on an empty stomach then sat back to record our data. 

30 minutes: There was a strong sense of calm and relaxation. My partner noted her headache's strength downgrading to a lower pain scale. I had a tingling sensation that encompassed my brain and slight prickling feeling on my arms. Here I should add that this was all on the positive side.

60 Minutes: My partner has a deeper sense of relaxation and a heightened sense of euphoria. Headache completely gone and also felt a tingling sensation in her frontal lobe. All positive. Much laughter followed.

80 Minutes: I feel at ease and also have a strong euphoric rush. We head to the bedroom to further investigate our surroundings. A note I'd like to add here: At this point I find myself breaking out into spontaneous laughter. Everything is 100% more amusing.

115 Minutes: We find ourselves staring at an elaborate blanket that is on our bed. The patterns seem to float as if a wave and there are shapes and figures we've never noticed before. The best way I can describe the visual is how you would see heat waves in the summer looking off in the distance. 

Lost track of time: Immensely hungry and having the realization that I am very much in control of my thoughts. We are both discovering that we can still function somewhat normally despite the fact that I am still laughing at random intervals. My head seems to be racing with lots of thoughts and new ideas. My partner is overwhelmed by a soothing drowsiness that finally sets her off to slumber peacefully. I manage to stay up a little longer and ponder many things. My brain is in overdrive while it processes all the amazing things going on inside my body. This is all very positive indeed. My legs felt like hey were steadily paddling through water as I waved them back and forth under my blanket. Finally, I drift off into a truly restful sleep. 

We both wake up with absolutely no side effects. Neither one of us felt physically ill or had any negative reactions. The ""come down"" was almost nonexistent. Unless, of course, if you count going to sleep the ""come down"". 

Conclusion: In our professional opinion this was by far one of the safest forms of altered mental states one can attain using natural growth provided by mother nature.

I've been really enjoying fiddling with my vegetable/herb garden this summer. Not a lot of goods but I still enjoy it for some reason. I'm sure it'll do better next year with some preperation and experience under my belt.

Anyway. I love white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) and I've been reading up on how to grow them. I know most posts here are for psilocybin muchrooms but I figured I'd give it a try anyway.

I have a ""plan"" in mind based on the various stuff that I've read and I want to see if makes any sense or if there are any glaring holes in it.


**Spawn**: I bought [THIS]( http://www.ebay.com/itm/190505148271?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649#ht_765wt_950) on ebay and I'm awaiting delivery. My understanding is that I'll either want to sow this directly on my substrate? do I mix it or just sow on top?

Side-Question: If I were to do PF-Tek (not suitable for this type I know) with spawn, would I mix spawn with distilled water and put into syringes? I'm having a bit of a hard time recognizing the differences between all the possible ""sources"". Spawn, syringes, culture, prints, etc. Am I correct in assuming that pre made syringes are just a mix of spawn and distilled water? 



**Substrate:** I don't want to pay $30 for big bag of sterilized manure online that needs to be used within a couple of weeks. I want to start small. I'm planning to get composted manure at home depot and microwave nuke it. I know this is not proper sterilization but people seem to have some luck with it so I figure it'll be a good first step. If it fails first try I'm going to see about sterilizing it somehow. 


**Casing:** I don't really understand the concept of casing in relation to Agaricus bisporus. I have seen peat moss mentioned (readibly available in home depot) but I don't really know how to use it. Do I jsut put it on top after the colonization is finished?



**Temperature control:** My apartment is plenty warm (I live in Texas) for colonization, but from what I read temperatures mid-60's are ideal for pinning. Any advice on cooling? As far as I can tell there is no easy solution such as a ""cooling mat"" like you can get a heating mat. All the ideas that I considered included using ice somehow and would probably cool way too much. 


**Humidity control**: Not really sure on this one either but I think I'll manage somehow. I'm really obsessed with misting my plants when I'm at home. Also have some plexiglass DIY knowledge if I need to make a terrarium. 


**Housing**: Was considering just using something like [THIS](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k2YhGIZ-f-s/TkbQ3DY-WjI/AAAAAAAAKJg/mSEKontb9TE/s720/IMG_20110813_142502.jpg) although perhaps a few inches taller for easier humidity control. I have some silocone sealant if it does not appear to be somewhat air tight.

It's basically a budget method of agar plate cleaning.

All you will need is: Ground Rice/Barley, Horse Manure, and a Dried Mushroom Cap

1. Create a mush with the ground rice and water, boil it in the microwave. Smear it over a small plate, allow to to dry somewhat outdoors in the sun, you dont want it sopping wet. Alternatively, remove the grain from the microwave before it becomes overly saturated.

2. Using a sterilized utensil, break up the mushroom cap gill over the plate of whatever grain you used. Cover with plastic wrap to maintain humidity.

3. After a couple of days, you should see all kinds of funky stuff start to grow on the grain plate. Now it is time to prepare the horse manure

4. Boil the hpoo up on a stove and afterwards squeeze out as much water as you can - I personally like to leave the hpoo out in the sun to dry off a bit. You know the hpoo is optimally damp when you put it in a container and you see almost no moisture collecting on the walls. Then prepare another small plate this time with a shallow layer of hpoo.

5. From your grain plate that is now growing mold, fungus and bacteria and looks totally gross, use a sterilized knife to cut out tiny (the size of a rice grain) areas that only have white fuzz growing, and transfer those spots to the plate of hpoo. It should look like this: http://imgur.com/mqmlmUY 

6. Eventually these small white dots will spread and take over the plate of hpoo, during this time keep a lookout for any signs of contamination in which case remove healthy areas to new hpoo.

7. Once it takes over the plate and looks thick and healthy, cut it up into small pieces and mix them into a large container of hpoo. Now just keep it humid and in no time youll have your own mushrooms! Try dunking the cake in sterile water before fruiting begins for great results. Once the hpoo cake is expired, add it to more hpoo and stick it in the ground, you'll probably find some fatties pokin out a month later.

Horse manure is excellent as a substrate since it is incredibly contamination resistant and fungus thrives on it.
