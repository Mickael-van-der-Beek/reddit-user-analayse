It's a long story as to how I found out I had rated the wrong photo set, but I went back and re-rated the same user (upon request) at a 93%.

I had gotten busy at work, so there was a ~24 - 48 hour gap between ratings.

The user thanked me for the updated rating and (in passing) informed me that she had cried and nearly taken a day off of work because of the 35% rating I gave.

That was a bit of a slap in the face.  In the sense that it was a painful wake-up call - not in the sense that I was offended.

It was then that I realized that this novelty account is **extremely destructive**.

It occured to me that the point of transpassing is *not* to get a rating from an outgroup - you could do that by going out in public and asking people ""Hey, do I look male or female?""

Rather, it's to get a rating from *ingroup* - from an audience composed of people who have gone through the same experience, had the same struggles, and suffer from the same insecurities.  It's supposed to be a safe place.

For a little while, **I ruined your safe place.**

The hell of it is, most of you were too nice to mention anything of the sort to me - probably out of respect to Reddit's commitment to free speech.

For what it's worth, **I'd like to offer an apology.**

I thought (when I made the account) I'd be providing a useful insight to people who wanted to be rated - but I hadn't thought it through properly.  It was insensitive of me, and I'm sorry.

To those of you who received low ratings, I'm especially sorry.  Understand that what I presented was a single perspective from a single subjective individual, and that it's *really* hard to get a true impression of what someone looks like through still photographs over the internet.  Body language, voice, bearing, and attitude are all important - and you can't really reduce that down to a percentage.

I've deleted all of my public ratings, and this novelty account will go inactive.

I'll check in front time to time in case someone throws a message this way.

-A contrite hetero male.

**TL;DR:  I'm a douchebag and I'm going to stop it now.  Sorry.**

**Mod(s):  Feel free to take this down whenever you'd like.  It's not my intent to create drama.  However, I publicly embarrassed several members here.  I felt they deserved a public apology.**",,False,self,t5_2t5fu,False,,,True,t3_qadxw,http://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/comments/qadxw/a_brief_apology/,

First, I saw that there may have been a demand for people to opt out of his ratings and thought that maybe, it would be better to try to put that in the title of a post, so I have [tried, no guarantess] to put in some CSS so that if you have ""IC:"" (standing for in community) at the beginning of your post, it shows up pink and says that you want opinions from only people in the trans community. I would encourage, in these posts, for people not so much to focus on how well the person passes, but focus on commenting on helping them how to pass. ""OC:"" (standing for out [of] community) at the beginning will opt in to all ratings and ask for complete honesty. Still, I admonish you, if the person does not pass in your mind, tell them, but if you can, tell them why and what they might be able to do to change it. That leaves normal ones, which I suppose I don't know what that means, but if there is a consensus on this, I will put it in the sidebar. If you like this idea, say so in the comments and if it seems to have support, I will put it with the rules in the sidebar.

Second, I know I may not have been doing the greatest at moderating lately, I have been busy with school and such. That said, if you report a comment, or a link, or a post you posted did not show up, message me through messaging the mods, and I will fix it as soon as I can. Also, if you think you might be good as a second moderator, please message me through the modmail, a second moderator may be helpful to me.

Third, I was thinking about changing it to only text posts so that people may clarify what they are looking for, whether tips, or if they pass etc... in the text part of the post.

Please tell me your opinions below on what you like and you don't like.

So I posted awhile back when I was just a youngin, 4 months into transition and I was freaking out because the public kept gendering me incorrectly. Well alot of you super nice people had gendered me female but I also got a few, 4 months is too early to really expect big changes and such.

So here is my timeline in its entirety: http://imgur.com/a/qesPU

I guess I wanna know if I am still passable, did something go wrong? what does everyone think of my journey? (the physical side I guess, lol). Since my timeline is reaching almost 60 pictures of nothing but me, here is my 11 month mark: http://imgur.com/a/qesPU#8c5QQ RAYBANS!

oh and I wanna say that the general public almost never genders me as male anymore :] regardless of how fancy I do myself up to be, which is really cool when Im feeling lazy! :D

It did make me happier that, according to that subreddit, I do pass without makeup (however, I do look pretty horrible).

----------------------------------------

So here are some pictures with make up (there's one without makeup at the bottom):

(19 as of today, 29 days on HRT)

----------------------------------------

I think I've gone a relatively long way from where I was a month ago, and I'm feeling a tad better. This subreddit has generally given me a lot of inspiration. The road is long and there is still a long way to go for me. And hopefully it will only get better. Lots of ups and downs - on some days you feel like you look decent, and on other, you just feel like utter piece of shit. I think a lot of people in the same situation would share my opinions.

Some are able to pass well, some aren't. Some think they pass well, but they don't. For some, it's the other way around. We are our own worst judges, I guess. And that's one of the many reasons we turn to other people for help.

Now, sometimes, I just think I look and feel incredible, but I have a really low self esteem and I just come crashing down. I don't know what to say, I've had it all, people kinda laughing a bit at me, people not wanting to sit next to me or avoiding me, and while I thought I looked ok, the person closest to me said she wasn't sure I passed from afar, and I got sir'd the other day... If anyone has some input, I'll appreciate it :)

Here's some pics I took this week: (removed-ty everyone) click and make it bigger. 
Sorry for the stupid poses, I'm silly XD
Tried to get some neutral expression / position pics, the non neutral are at the end.

Please be honest and let me know everything, thanks! Any comment that helps me will be upvoted so high, you will lose count XD jk

Update: Whoa, so much positive feedback, it's hard to believe! Too good tobe true *looks suspiciously*. Since the writing of this I walk with much more confidence than before, which was probably not helping at all.Walk with confidence, conquer world!

Be honest. Don't try to tell me what you think I'd want to hear. Just tell me what you see. I'm interested in perceptions.

--Edit--

I'm seeing a lot of ""pretty ambiguous, but I would think on the male side,"" which is kinda what I'm going for. Which is really cool that you guys see it, but at the same time really frustrating, because I have yet to have a single person get my pronouns right (besides people who I've specifically told I prefer male pronouns). At work I'm ""ma'am""ed and ""lady""d by customers without hesitation. There is not even a moment where they maybe look a little unsure, they just immediately assume I identify as female. Yesterday I was scooping gelato for a really large, particularly slimy-looking cisman who kept telling me ""atta girl,"" which is f--ing demeaning enough when used in reference to a female, but when it's also misgendering it's just unbelievable. I was so shocked and furious and had to go in the back for a bit to only somewhat successfully ward off a panic attack.


The thing is,

I'm 4'11"".

People see how small I am and immediately assume I'm female. Every time a customer misgenders me with ease at work, a tiny piece of my soul gets crushed. But this confirms it for me: at least 80% of it has to do with my height.

But what the f-- am I supposed to do about that? Wear inserts? Great, now I'm 4'11.5"". hooray. ",,False,self,t5_2t5fu,True,,trans,True,t3_s0k9s,http://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/comments/s0k9s/how_would_you_gender_me/,

1339997993.0,22,self.transpassing,v7nvx,"From being called one of the Cray twins, and 10 years HRT later...",SarahC,28,6,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/comments/v7nvx/from_being_called_one_of_the_cray_twins_and_10/,"I've had a lot of feedback over the last 10 years, so I've got a fairly good idea of how I look ""in the real world"", where camera angles don't exist, and I can't select a good looking image.

It was a long wait - about 4 years on hormones, before I started to get gendered almost all of the time correctly.

To learn how I was passing in the face and voice, I'd do the ""Baggy clothes gender test."" it's MUCH better than asking friends, or people online.

You don some baggy black T-shirt, and loose fitting jeans, and head for a part of town you've not been seen in before. Drop by some upmarket shops, ""Yes sir/maddam, how can I help you?"" or ask someone for directions when they're with other people (so they can say ""Oh, John, can you tell her/him where the Bowling ally is?"")...

It's great, unbiased feedback.

If you can pass like that, you shouldn't be worried how you'll be read in the gendered clothes of your choice, as they'll move you more into that gender.... unlike the neutral clothes.

10 years on, and I've managed to pass for the last 5 years or so without problems.

**I'm posting this for people who are worried that they don't measure up to the people posting on here who can pass without ANY hormones... don't worry HRT is a hell of a drug!**

I was 24 when I caved and started HRT - I'd been wanting to by drugs for about 8 years... this was back before Internet shopping was a thing, and pharmacies online had never been heard of. I went as far as filling out a form for ""Transform""'s ""Super Strength Femme Tablets"", at $350 for 30, it was a HUGE rip off, and looking back, it might have been full of phytoestrogens, just like Soy-milk is. In other words, a huge, huge rip off. I never posted it... afraid of what my parent might think if they found it.

I totally regret waiting around!

Here's a piccy when I was around 21 - 3 years before hormones...    imagine me posting on here, in transPassing, wearing a tank-top. =)

Here's me 10 ish years later..... I'm not THAT femme, BUT, it's enough to get me around in society without problem. I've been to interviews and got the jobs, shopping, nights out... everything's been good.

Here's one from the side:

And one with a flash, that's not on any special angle....

So, things against me:

1: I started hormones VERY late. (which means they don't work as well)    
2: I looked very masculine at the start.    
3: I looked very ugly... HRT softens features, so I look a little less horrid. =)

Feel free to comment and add ideas you know!

~Do Try

*Over Shirts: Wearing something as simple as a plaid over shirt or dress shirt over a tee helps give you more coverage for those days when binding is an issue.

*Baseball Tees: If you already have binding taken care of, a baseball tee helps visually separate your shoulders from your torso, giving the appearance of broader shoulders. It helps to chose a lighter color for the sleeves and a darker color for the torso, but either way works.

*Tank Top Binders: A binder designed with a built in tank top is a gift from heaven in the summer heat. They are usually all integrated, no extra seams and just all around a good thing to have in your closet.

~Don't try

*Skinny Jeans: Even when you wear men's, unless you have loser skinnys, it's usually a bad idea, simply because it accentuates your hips.

*(Regular) Tank Tops: Even with a binder it's just too easy to see you have on upper undergarments aka: binder/sports bra, and lets be honest guys, it makes it almost impossible for the average pre op ftm to pass.

*Super Baggy Clothing: Yeah everyone know's on sick days it's nice to be able to go sans binder and hide in a giant hoodie the size of Texas, but the simple fact is that it makes you look smaller and very frumpy. Studies show that you may have a tendency to feel less motivated or attractive in clothing that doesn't fit properly. Also! You CAN wear more tailored clothing and still pass! It's all about how you go about it.

[Me as of ~15 minutes ago](http://imgur.com/mKw2g)

I get gendered male by most people. When I look in mirror's and such, I see a girl looking back at me (which confuses the hell out of me, because aren't I supposed to be seeing a guy looking back long after everyone stops gendering me male? That's the general feeling I get from just about every post on the trans* reddits.)

The only two reasons I can think of for why I keep getting gendered male are my voice (which I'm working on, but it's not yet presentable), and my hair. That said, I occasionally get gendered male before people speak to me.

Whenever it's feasible, I'll take a full body pic and post it. I don't have a full-body mirror in my dorm, so it'll be a while (probably a different post if I can't do it tonight).

Oh, also. my brows are kinda waxed. I kinda did a crap job of DIY'ing them. I'm going to talk to some of my friends and see if I can get one of them to help me/do them for me.

So I finally decided, why not! Here I am! 

About me: I'm 23, mostly-cis girl, and I love all kinds of girls and all things girly. My brother and I have a hobby for impressions and voice training respectively, and he always comes to me to polish a voice he's having trouble with. I have a passion for makeup, hair care (especially if it's organic), nail polish, and all kinds of fashion for all kinds of body types. But most of all I'm gushy and loving and just want to make people as happy as they can be. 

If you want help or just want to talk, PM me and we can arrange whatever form of communication you're most comfortable with, even if it's limited to Reddit. Or, just comment! Or not. I'm a redditor, not a cop.

I'll go over the basics of makeup such as:

*Foundation
*Concealer
*Contour
*Highlight
*Lips
*Eyebrows
*Eyeliner
*Eyeshadow
*Eyelashes
*Blush
*Products
*Brushes
*And an introduction of myself

I know there's a lot of videos explaining how to do this but its more directed to those who have more girlish faces, there's also /r/BeautyDiagrams *Sometimes photos don't do justice*. Keep in mind when I do these videos I will assume you know little about makeup so I will explain in depth. Here goes nothing! I hope you watch! Expect the series later this week!

The best part were these three guys, two I know, one I don't.

The other two(brothers) I've been around in guy mode, but not girl mode.  The younger brother was stumbling by me and then stopped, looked at me, leaned over to get a better look and said my male name.  I said his name back.  He then was like wow, I had no idea, I thought you were a tall girl.  Then later his brother who was out on a beer run got back and came into the room, I greeted him and he did a doubletake and said my name.

As in the title: this isn't me attempting girlmode; I'm wearing girl clothes and have my hair styled slightly more feminine than usual (at home, for comfort), but I'm not wearing makeup and there are features I know will need to be improved before I can pass. That said, I'm curious to see how people think I'm doing in general (how close I am to passing, etc.) and if anyone has any suggestions regarding hair, makeup, FFS, etc.

* [Ye olde angle shot.](http:///) I like this one (on a relative scale).
* For the sake of accuracy: [A more neutral angle and expression.](http:///) (My chin doesn't usually look that square, I think it's the lighting.)

Things I already know I need to work on:

* Eyebrows!!!
* Facial hair shadow (may not be too visible in these pictures, but it can be pretty noticeable under better lighting)
* Nose, jaw squareness, adam's apple
* Voice (not pictured here :P)

1376822376.0,13,self.transpassing,1klluu,[IC/OC] Almost 20 y.o MTF. Why do I look feminine only when I smile?,Elesaa,14,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/comments/1klluu/icoc_almost_20_yo_mtf_why_do_i_look_feminine_only/,"http://imgur.com/a/E03U2

tl;dr: Please help me pass lol.

I'm feeling awful. I'm still in boymode and stuff, but I have noticed that I look female or at least very feminine when I smile. However, when I don't, I immediately go back to androgynous mode and I look a bit masculine, apparently. Do I have to smile like a lifeless doll 24/7 to be able to look like a female? There have been a few times when I have covered my mouth with something and I have been gendered female, but as soon as I stop covering it, I'm frequently sir'ed.

For the record, I have been self-medding since September 2012 but I started a standard dose on December. HRT has already softened my features a bit, but until my first appointment with the endo, I don't know what to do. Is there like a plateau for HRT changes? When should I stop expecting changes? Can make-up help with my mouth?

Some guy approached me on the street and told me that he didn't know if I was male or female (I'm still presenting male all the time but have been gendered female until they perform a close inspection on me), and other than dressing female, voice, and waiting for HRT to do its job, I don't know what else I should do. Do I need to style my eyebrows in a different way? What can I do with my hair? Will I ever look attractive..?

Umm, I'm aware that the lightning in the pictures is kind of crappy and I also forgot to mention that I have this disgusting overbite. Will correcting it help me look more female? Thanks and sorry for the long post, but I'm feeling terrible. And please VERY honest but gentle.",,False,self,t5_2t5fu,False,,trans,True,t3_1klluu,http://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/comments/1klluu/icoc_almost_20_yo_mtf_why_do_i_look_feminine_only/,
