To believe the PR statements Maxis makes, to embrace online services like online single player and online savegames. To ignore red flags in interviews, to accept questionable decisions from EA and to listen to Lucy full of respect.

No, the truth needs to be said. EA and Maxis deserve every hate they get. And they still do because Lucy continues to lie, the servers are still bad, savegames are being lost, gameplay features are still disabled and gamebreaking bugs are still not fixed. That is unheard of almost 2 weeks after release. Even MMO's get this done faster. On top of that they are actively trying to patch out modding, delete mod topics and ban modders from origin. They have now almost disappeared from this once Maxis-filled community. Now that we need them the most for fixing bugs, patch notes and patch schedules. The game is out, we want to play it, do your jobs! We all paid you in full, some even bought day one dlc. Don't hide because we caught you on your lies and bugs. Be a man about it! Admit it, apologize and fix it. You owe us!

Here on reddit the truth needs to be said. It is what puts the spotlight on the wrongdoings of EA and Maxis. What EA is desperately trying to hide and Lucy tries to cover with lies.

1363150573.0,1410,self.SimCity,1a75te,How It Came To This,Heinrich_Agrippa,1899,489,817,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a75te/how_it_came_to_this/,"So as the week has passed, it’s become more and more evident something – no many things – are horribly wrong. The list of offenses is egregious and growing:

-Draconian DRM which monitors you at all times, requiring you to be online to report in at regular intervals.

-Horrendously unreliable servers wholly incapable of supporting the number of players.

These two issues alone are damning. You must play under the strict EA terms and only when they allow you. You thought you purchased this game and own it, but soon realize you’ve only been granted tentative permission to borrow it, and only when it’s convenient. Little did most suspect that these issues would only be the tip of the iceberg.
Then came the game itself:

-A supposedly required set of server-side calculations to allow for a simulation engine so complex and powerful that your puny computer alone wouldn’t be able to handle it – revealed to be a hollow lie concocted to justify not allowing any offline play.

-Cities that reach populations of hundreds of thousands of individual Sims – revealed to be another lie – the supposed hundreds of thousands of Sims being nothing but a number displayed on the screen desperately hoping you won’t notice your actual population is but a tenth of what it displays.

-Sim AI as dumb as shit. Quite literally, the sewage agents are no different in their one-track behaviors than the Sims themselves. There are no doctors, no engineers or scientists; no teachers or real police or firemen. There are only generic nomad agents which assume the first job they stumble into that day, and sleep in the closest available house that night. Not a thing about them resembles a real life. They are all as mindless and generic as the water, electricity and sewage that all travel the same streets.

-Finally, even the game’s cities themselves cannot function with these sewage-brained Sims and they inevitably collapse in a sea of asinine gridlock as the entire police force prioritizes individual criminals in sequence, as do the firefighters with fires and the workers with jobs. And so your city will crumble as uncontrolled inferno erupts in factories while 16 fire trucks dutifully douse a smoking kitchen on the other side of town.

Perhaps some may have found it in themselves to forgive the onerous DRM policies and unreliable server issues, but the final nail in the coffin is the stream of blatant lies which were marketed. We were told this revolutionary SimCity would at last achieve the coveted dream of simulating an entire city of individuals, and that from these individuals the social dynamics of modern life would fantastically emerge before our eyes. Instead we get a population counter that shamelessly inflates the modeled population by up to a factor of ten. Worse yet, the minority of existing Sims aren’t the dynamic individuals we were promised, but a shambling horde of mindless, indistinguishable zombies entirely incapable of any situational decision making.

How did it come to this? It’s been speculated that perhaps those who pushed for publication at EA considered the customers so stupid that they wouldn’t notice. While it’s abundantly evident that the EA executives think very little of their customers, I suspect the truth is much more sinister. It wasn’t a matter how whether they would be found out, but whether they could maintain the façade for a week. After all, that is when most sales would be made.

Once it was clear that the game was fundamentally broken, damage control was required. In many situations, a delay might have occurred, but perhaps some market research showed that Maxis customers didn’t overlap too heavily with other EA published subsidiaries. Perhaps they felt that the entire Maxis dynasty had been more or less burnt out anyway. And so a decision was made: burn the SimCity fan base and maximize immediate profit. They knew the outcome and thought “They won’t ever buy from EA again, but we won’t need them too. By then we’ll have cut our losses and grabbed as much money from this broken SimCity as possible. Then we’ll never bother with this franchise again.”
Everything served this purpose. The one hour beta ensured that no one would be able to see the deep and horrible flaws. Like sleazy used-car salespeople, they only needed it to last for a test-drive. The terrible AI and the inflated population statistics only needed to trick the viewer long enough to secure a sale. The DRM wasn’t expected to deter pirates forever, but maximize the number of impulsive first-week-purchasers who would have otherwise tried a pirated version first. The failed server infrastructure saved costs and in actuality helped delay the inevitable discovery of the game’s many failings.
Like good snake-oil salesmen, they knew they would eventually be found out and have planned accordingly. By the time the villagers gather the torches and pitchforks in rage, they will have skipped town – off to con another franchise’s fan base.

In short, you’ve all been screwed.

1363033305.0,1359,self.SimCity,1a3nf2,To Maxis Devs: Here's a condensed list of extremely good ideas that have been brought up by the community in the last few days. (Will update).,Paradigm6790,1570,211,471,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3nf2/to_maxis_devs_heres_a_condensed_list_of_extremely/,"Hello all,

I see a lot of great ideas and I've seen the colorful Maxis rep reply, and they seem earnest in their desire to improve the game. I figured I'd help both sides out by trying to collect the good ideas into one page. I'll be updating this as I go along, and it may be a couple hours between (have to drive home) updates.

Hopefully Maxis/EA will get a nice list of improvements, while we can (potentially) get some features we sorely desire.

I know we're all feeling raw and jaded from the launch (both sides alike), but let's take a step in the right direction.

**Please comment with links to good suggestion posts/comment with ideas, fellow redditors.**

*[Bus Routes(and building off that, Fire/Police/Ambulance routes)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a2xql/necessary_idea_bus_routes_for_fucks_sake/)

*Multiple Highway entrances. There are a few posts about it, but the content is uncontructive.

*Improved pathing agents (no need to link posts, we're all well aware of this)

*One way streets. Simple idea, put signs for 1 way traffic, if a car violates that they become a criminal.

*[More connections between cities](http://imgur.com/jzgRPRf)

*[Zoning specific Services](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a2lqt/zoning_vehicles_suggestion/)

*Improve emergency response. (Don't send all your firetrucks to 1 fire. Assign more based on traffic conditions ( and for god sakes send them down different roads)

*[Overpasses](http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I64-I295-Int-Feb0307-13.jpg) This already exists to a degree with roads climbing mountains, but being able to control it would greatly reduce traffic congestion.

*[More tutorials](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3nf2/to_maxis_devs_heres_a_condensed_list_of_extremely/c8tskif). More than just highway planning. These will probably crop up as community-driven tutorials, however.

*[Hotkey remapping](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3a23/request_hotkey_remapping/)

*[More intuitive Region View](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3jf9/feature_request_when_i_am_in_spectator_mode/)

*[Service Sharing/Region UI/Town Hall options](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3nf2/to_maxis_devs_heres_a_condensed_list_of_extremely/c8tt3ut)

*[Be able to view previous messages/prompts](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3nf2/to_maxis_devs_heres_a_condensed_list_of_extremely/c8ttm7m)

*Enable city growth while in another city of your own.

*Increased plot size. Currently 53x53 ""dashes"".

*Region creator tool

*Emergency Vehicle priority

*Train Station snap-to-road

*A way to deal with ""stuck"" abandoned regions (No bonds, taxes can't get you out of red, cannot receive money because game is paused)

*Improve Advisory intelligence (zoning guy mostly)

*[Game List Sorting] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a2l9n/maxis_give_us_an_option_to_sort_the_game_list_in/)

*More road planning (tolls/road naming/etc)

*And obviously, the internet hates DRM and we all want offline mode, but I feel like a nod at the elephant in the room at the bottom is more than enough. To continue with the animal idioms, let's not beat a dead horse.*

Even though it wouldn't be my preferred method, these hateful, disrespectful, bashing posts are actually useful in gauging how upset the people are who actually bought the game.  

If the outrage disappears by filtering/limiting/deleting posts, people like me who haven't bought the game yet won't be getting the whole picture.

Here's the official forum post [link](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9453148.page).  Note that the servers will be down for approximately 2 hours at 1pm PST on Monday.

Update 2.0 Notes

What’s New

* Mayors Mansion: Mayors will now drive their fancy cars to work. Mayor will take their helicopter, limo, or sports car if the modules are present. 

* Data maps: Now show in their normal color when a color filter is enabled (unless in a colorblind mode)

* HUD: Now color-corrects when in a colorblind mode.

Fixes and Updates

* Cities not Processing: Mitigates some of the issues that were causing cities not to process. We are continuing to work on and improve this issue.

* Region Filters: Now sorts regions with available cities to the top

* Invitations: Invitations to join a region should be sent and received more quickly.

* Tourism: Fixes for unexplained fluctuation of tourists. Tourists more smartly counted on transit.

* Cruise ships should now be a lot more effective at bringing medium and high wealth tourists in coastal cities.

* New tourists will now decide to come into a city once leaving tourists reach train stations, bus depots, or cruise ship docs instead of waiting for those tourists to go out to the region first.

* This change should reduce the downtime of tourist buildings.

* Casinos: Casinos tuned so that Gambling will be a more profitable specialty. Players must bulldoze and replace existing casinos to see effects of tuning.

* The larger casinos now invite more tourists into the city which helps keep them full.

* Note that existing casinos will need to be replaced to take advantage of this change.

* More Casinos: Raised module limit on Sci-Fi and Sleek Casinos to 6 modules.  

* Region Play: Cash gifts can now be received in a bankrupt city.

* Education: Fixed school buses getting stuck at the high school. Existing Schools will fix themselves.

* Education: Fixed school buses picking up students at neighboring cities that didn’t have school bus stops. 

* Education: Fix to more accurately track regional student population.

* Education: Fix where kids leaving the school bus stop would teleport to the nearest pedestrian path instead of walking directly into the school. 

* Education: University wings now give the proper bonus.

* Recycling: Fix for the Recycling Center where it would sometimes stop working, recycling services will visit other cities.

* Air pollution: Fixed issue where air pollution would appear to come from nowhere. Fix issues where your regional air pollution would be reflected back into your box for a double penalty.  

* Fire Service: Fire Trucks don’t clump, dispatch to fires more efficiently.

* Water: Water pumps are now capable of pumping water from rivers at a larger radius so they can take better advantage of the water table in a city.

* Disasters:  Some players were getting hit too frequently with random disasters, this introduces a cooldown where no random disasters will occur.

* Trade: Fix for trade ports that suddenly stop shipping. 

* Transit: Street Cars and Buses go to high volume stops first.

* Transit: A city with residents and public transit will now provide the accurate amount of workers and shoppers to its neighbors.

* Transit: A transit vehicle stuck in a pick-up or drop off loop will now go back to a garage instead of trying to pick up more people.

* Transit vehicles should recover automatically after the update. If players want to force the recovery, turn off the stops that are having looping issues, wait a few game hours, then turn them back on. 

* Transit:  Neighbors buses will now come in lower numbers into the city and do a better job at picking up local passengers first. 

* Traffic: Medium density roads now create traffic lights at intersections with other roads and avenues of equal or higher density.

* Residential Tuning: Residential-only cities have failure state.

* Buildings are prevented from going up in density when they don’t have power or water.

* The amount of happiness gained from low taxes, police, fire, and health outreach has been lowered.

* Fixed some cases where buildings would not go abandoned when they should have.

* Higher density residential buildings are no longer blocked from going abandoned due to not having enough money.

* Happiness from low taxes does not double up every time it is given.

* Losing happiness due to not having a job is more impactful.

* Budgets: Fixed bug with monthly transactions being used to get around systems pushing back.  

* Systems like fire, abandonment, garbage, sewage don’t turn on until you've made a certain amount of money.  Gifts from neighbors are taken into account as well.

* You can no longer create a city that never gets fires, crime, health, or other pushback issues.

* Income progression (which we use to turn on pushback systems) was not including transactions from gifts, global market sales, or loans.

* Income progression should always go up regardless if you have higher expenses. It is the total income that you are bringing in from your city that turns on pushback systems.

* Audio: Fixes issue where audio will stop working after creating a large city or where phantom audio sounds play in a city.

* Demolish: Fixes issue that occurred when players demolished buildings that had service vehicles, delivery vehicles, or agents out in the city or region. Previously, the agents would be in a state of limbo and would not recover when new buildings of that type were placed. This will no longer happen.

Because this is our first significant Update, we wanted to inform you in advance that **we’ll be taking down all servers for approximately two hours while changes are being issued**. Choosing a time to issue a major Update is never easy, but after looking our peak player time, **we’ve concluded 1pm PST is the best window for us to make these improvements**. As you can see from the list above, the wait will be worth it.

I was hoping for a patch that makes the game playable. Today, that little bit of hope just vanished.

The last patch was released nearly a month ago and contained nothing but minor fixes. A big patch was announced shortly after release and we still don't know when it's coming. Only thing we do know: The list of fixes is.. rather short compared to the amount of time it was in development.

Instead of fixes we get DLC. But not the good stuff. We get a sorry excuse for in game advertising and the privilege of watching how EA exploits a dying cash cow...

What I'm trying to say is: I just uninstalled the game, kicked Origin where it belongs (beyond the recycle bin) and I don't have any intention of buying another EA title. Ever. As in ""for the rest of my life"".

1363193349.0,806,self.SimCity,1a82e2,What a Shame... SimCity Ruined,AJm4ck,1106,300,378,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a82e2/what_a_shame_simcity_ruined/,"SimCity 2000 was the second game I ever played. I started playing it with my father when I was about 7 or 8 years old. It was the first game I've ever been addicted to.

I watched him lay down zones, roads, and connect water. Soon buildings were popping up. It was magic on a computer screen. We'd spend hours in his office. Me looking over his shoulder as he smoked a cigarette and watched his city develop.

It wasn't long before I started playing the game myself, on days he would come home late. He'd come into the small office, and praise my work on his city, even if half of it was on fire.

Then I was developing my own cities, as my father became too busy with work to spend much time playing. I played it for over two, three, four years. At my current age, in my mid-twenties, it's hard to remember. But it was the complexity that drew me in.

There were highways, trains, seaports and airports. I remember building a few plots, then spending all my money on airport plots, just to watch them stay dormant as my city went bankrupt.

I learned things like traffic management, zoning commercial within residential areas, pollution control and how water got to my tap. It was SimCity that caused me to realize the water tower in my town wasn't there just to declare the town's name.

After SimCity 2000, I played 3000, then SimCity 4. I may not have spent as much time with these sequels, but that was only because high school got in the way. I still played them and I loved them. They were worthy sequels, to a revolutionary game.

Which brings me to the new ""SimCity"". EA apparently didn't have the heart to name it SimCity 5. Probably because calling that would lead people to assume its a successor to the other games.

It's not a successor. It's a dumbed-down game, for a society increasingly becoming dumbed-down. I'd be impressed if anyone has read this far, as attention spans online have shifted into reading the first sentence of paragraphs and catchy headlines.

What EA and Maxis has delivered here is a game that would be fun on an iPad for an 11-year-old, for about two hours. The city size prevents users from creating anything other than a New York City borough. The pathfinding system leads sims to go to a different job and a different house every day. There are no highways for users to build, there are no subways.

Regions are some sort of no-mans green plush land. A national park of some kind that is not open to the user of the game. I almost think of the land between cities as EA's space. It represents all the money they refused to give up to make this into a worthy successor. It's what could have been.

That space is where a suburban community could have flourished. Where heritage breed pigs were bred that could later appear on a menu in one of my city's downtown restaurant districts. But no, that area is out of the dotted white bounds that have now constricted a fanbase teeming for a new game for 10 years.

This game, with all of its fancy graphics, expensive marketing and city specializations fell short of the one requirement of its educated fanbase - an effective simulation.

And now Maxis and EA have gone silent. They have not addressed the real issues at the heart of this game, wasting what little momentum they had during the release on a terrible server problem.

But now the real questions are coming out and the gaming executives are curling up in their shell.

As a gamer, who feels the best days of games are behind us, who now feels stuck in a system of downloadable content where everything is about leveling up to gain some kind of random skin, achievement, or gold coating, that means nothing and is worth nothing, this is the latest slap to my face.

SimCity was the game that tested your mind, taught you about design, about interactions of people, commerce, wealth, trade, transportation... but now it's just another stupid social game, that's not social, that's not fun and that's not mentally challenging.

If this is the direction gaming developers are going, then you can no longer call me a gamer.


*Edit: Thanks for all the love, I had no idea anyone would actually care about how this game made me feel. And, I have a wonderful father, who has never let me down once in my life. Other than that, thanks for the recommendations on new games I should try. My only hope is that Maxis/ EA fixes this game so we can all enjoy what we expect of a SimCity game - a huge sandbox city game, the best of its kind, capable of being entertaining, educational and (somewhat) realistic in its simulation.*

**Birth**
You are born in ""The Region"".  The Region is a mystical land that can be seen in the distance, but never reached.  Stories have been told of people who commute, but those who pass through The Region never return the same. 

**Caste**
When you are born, you are given a caste.  This will be your role in life.  You will be either a Worker, a Shopper or a Kid.  You will be given a wealth level.  This will shape your experience for the rest of your pitiful existence.   You are loaded up into a truck with a number of other Workers, Shoppers and Kids of the same Wealth class and The Region has you materialize in The City.

**The life of a Shopper**
You are a shopper.  You wake up in your new home, it's called the Windsor residence. You are disorented.  You look at the clock, it's 5:45 AM.  What is your name?  You don't remember... Windsor, it must be Windsor, but that's a last name... what was it Michael?  Matthew? Maybe it was Francis Windsor. That's right, Francis.  You are the book keeper in this new home, you look in the cupboard and there are nothing but yellow and green cans.  The yellow cans are marked Money, the green cans are marked Happiness.  A sign in scrollwork above the cupboard explains ""Money makes Happiness"".  

It's 6:15, you feel an odd compulsion.  You aren't able to explain why, but you feel the calling of blue cans, a haunting voice in your head says ""You can buy pizza from the wig store now"". Uneasily you reach into the cupboard and grab one of the yellow cans.  You head down the street to the wig store.  You start to have an irrepressible thought ""Heading to the store before my shift starts!"" ... ""my shift of what?  Will I be going to work later?""  You've heard stories of people who work, but you'd always thought it was just workers that worked.  You get to the door of the wig store and a thought crosses your mind ""There is no food for your baby here.  Go to the gas station"" so you double back, you cross the street and head to the gas station.  

There is nobody filling up at the pumps.  You look around inside, and there's no fun to be found.  The voices lied to you.  In one side of the store there is a series of blue cans. On the other there is a series of blue pods.  A helpful shopkeeper comes up to you; he directs you to stand in the blue tube while he takes the yellow can you carried to him.  While you are in the tube you watch as he pours the blue can into the yellow can turning it green.  And then you start to feel a change, maybe THIS is the shift they were talking about?  Slowly you start to feel something being sucked out of you, you see a faint teal fluid draining through a hose at the top of the chamber where you've been interred.  You start to forget, all of the things you've learned so far: the story about the Windsor residence, the strange voices, the mishap at the wig store.  Your name, Francis Windsor.  You try to hold on to these things, but they keep slipping away.  You notice a teal can appear on the shelf behind the clerk's desk. 

Who am I? Where am I? The pod opens, and you are released.  You ask the clerk ""Who am I?"".  The clerk tells you ""Oh, I think you said you are Mary Jacobs"", a feeling of deja vu washes over you; ""Wasn't I a man?"" you think. But you can't remember, maybe you have been Mary Jacobs all along.  The clerk hands you a green can and sends you on your way.  A faint voice in your head tells you ""You're feeling happy! Head home!""  but where is home?  You start to knock on doors of every house you pass by.  This one is full, that one is full.  This one is empty, you look at the sign on the door, it says Henry Residence.  Maybe that's who you are, a Henry.  You enter the building and look at the cupboard.  There's a sign above it that says ""Money makes Happiness"" and a series of green and yellow cans.  You look at your green can, and place it on the shelf.  Then you start to think back, trying to recall any scrap of your memory.  You come up blank.  Maybe I was Frances, yeah that's right, Frances Henry.  All of a sudden a wave of compulsion washes over you.  There is pizza at the wig store, and I need to get that. 


**The Life of a Worker**

You awaken.  It's 8:00 AM.  You are not a morning person. You have lost any semblance of an identity long ago.  You've been asked to be so many things so many times that you don't know if any of them were ever really true. You look around, ""Where am I now?"" ... the Windsor residence.  You roll over in bed and see your wife for the night. ""What if this could be real?  What if we could just keep this?""  You gently kiss her neck and she slowly opens her eyes revealing a delicate twinkle.  ""Good morning honey"" she says with a sincere sweetness, but belying a grudging frustration.  

You get a call, you knew this would happen.  It's ""your boss"" - periodically someone with a ghastly voice claiming to be your boss will call you up and tell you to come to work.  He does not tell you where to come; it is always a different building.  But this is reality.  This is your life. But he does one thing, he calls you ""Richard"".  You know today that you are Richard Henry; you turn to your wife and see an inscrutible look on your wife's face as she sits in bed.  You've seen that look many times before.  You say to her ""Good Morning Mary."" and smile.  She looks comforted.  ""Mary...  Good Morning ...?"" she stammers.  ""Richard"" you respond. ""Ah, good Morning Richard."" Finally, she looks relieved.  

You both walk to the kitchen for breakfast, as you see Francis walking out the door with a yellow can.  You brought three of those cans home last night, and you've heard stories about what happens to people that carry those yellow cans out of the house.  You shudder at the thought.  ""What are you doing today dear?"" Mary says to you.  ""The boss called me in to work."" you reply.  ""I hate it when that happens, today I'm just going to look for work."" 

""Don't you get tired of this?"" you ask.  ""Yes, but there's nothing that can be done, I've seen what happens to workers who don't work in this economy.  Their houses get boarded up and they disappear, forever."" She says.  ""I just want to stop, you're beautiful Mary.  I want to just stop... with you.  I don't care if we get boarded up and disappear, I'd rather live a single day certain of who I am, what I'm doing, and then never again than live in perpetuity under a different roof with a different wife.  I just want to be me, and I want to be with you.""

""Oh Richard.  I want the same thing, this time I'm going to do it.  I'm just going to stay here.  I want to be free."" she exclaims.  From the beyond a voice booms ""Work makes free!"" and Mary and you are ejected from the Windsor Residence.  She starts walking away; you shout to her ""I thought we were going to be together!"", and she responds ""I am trying, I just can't control my body, I have to leave!  I will come back for you Richard, I promise!"".  You get another text on your phone telling you that you really need to come to work.  You know what happens when you come to work though, it happens every time.  Once you enter the workplace, people will fill up your house, it's gotten to the point that you don't even bother trying to return, you just find the nearest house and the nearest wife and make a new life.  But this time will be different.  You're not going to work today.  You decide to take the dirt road.  The dirt road is crowded, and a giant traffic jam develops.  There is another avenue that you could have taken, but that would only have gotten you to work on time.  Like Mary you're unable to avoid the compulsion to work, but be damned if you're not going to resist it the best you can.  This dirt road is a bit of a loophole.  Sitting through the overloaded road and the subsequent gridlock nearly two hours pass, but a workplace is in sight.  

Unable to resist you walk to the door -- full, thank goodness.  You start down the street and see another factory, it looks to be at capacity as well, you try to head to that one but you're unable to resist crossing the street, you see the factor and people are walking into it, there are jobs available.  This must be the one the boss was telling you about.  You look at your watch, only a few more minutes.  You get to the edge of the property and you get a call.  ""It's the boss, I don't know what you're trying to pull here.  Don't bother coming in today, you're too slow.  Next time think about your priorities.  I can make you disappear"".  Elated, you walk home, you remember your name, you are Richard Windsor, from the Windsor Residence.   Maybe Mary is alright too.  You get back to the Windsor residence just around noon in time to see the kids you've never met head off to the park.  You look in the cupboard and watch as three yellow cans disappear.  You know what the penalty is for running out of yellow cans, in this economy.  You sit down, open a beer and watch TV, it's the same hillbilly comedy show that plays all day and all night.  In the past you've gotten yourself sick just so you could drown it out with your coughing. 

6:30 PM, you hear the doorbell ring.  You see a bewildered woman at the door, she looks familiar.  ""Mary?"" you ask?  She looks a bit confused, ""Evelyn... I think. Evelyn Jacobs."" Damnit, they got to her. Could this still be her? Maybe it is. ""Well Evelyn, today you're a Windsor.  I'm Richard."" you explain.  ""Oh Richard, I'm tired of working at the factory."" she says, handing you three yellow cans - but she doesn't sound just physically tired, she sounds completely drained.  ""I don't want to watch TV tonight Richard, I want something different.  Tell me a story... Tell me about Mary"" she pleads.  You oblige and begin ... ""It was 8:00 AM..."" as you tell her the story you see a delicate twinkle in her eye.

**Users want to play single player offline.**

Period.

They don't want your 'vision' or 'ideas', so stop trying to push it upon them.  They don't want to have to constantly be connected to your servers.  They don't want to hear your bullshit lies. They don't want to play with other people.

Why ""design the game with multiplayer in mind"" when simcity has NEVER been multiplayer?  You knew that this would conflict with the history of this franchise and the fans.  Why make it ONLY multiplayer and *force* everyone that has played simcity to play multiplayer?

Sure, it would be cool to trade resources with a friend, or work towards a common goal, but only if it is OPTIONAL.

You have ignored your players' voices from day 1 about offline mode when this was the single most wanted thing to not happen.  You release an unfinished game without it being tested fully, and are denying refunds.

You need to LISTEN to your fans, you need to APOLOGIZE for lying to us, and you need to ADMIT that this game does not live up to the expectations of the franchise and that you guys have failed.


There are a few things that can be done though, if you DO finally decide to listen to us.

* Make an offline mode *optional*.  Those that want to play with friends and fulfill your 'vision' will still be able to.

* Make modding acceptable and available.  People that don't work for you guys are making this game more enjoyable and fun.  They are fixing what is broken.  You respond to this by patches, ban-able threats, and punishments.

* Make refunds readily available to those who request them.

* Admit that you lied to us about the ability for the game to run offline.


And for gods sakes, this game is *no where near close* to being anything like an MMO.

Instead of fulfilling YOUR 'vision' for this game, why didn't you think of the PLAYER'S 'vision' of this game?

1363135989.0,751,self.SimCity,1a6oeo,"PROOF THAT THE GAME IS MISLEADING REGARDING POPULATION COUNT, AMONG OTHER THINGS... ",monochromatic0,931,180,306,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a6oeo/proof_that_the_game_is_misleading_regarding/,"As a user of the Simcity forum named “anickle” brought up an experiment he made so he could understand why only a minor percentage (10-15%) of the sim population is considered workforce, I have decided to run the same experiment myself and stubled upon major flaws in the core game, flaws that are until now probably unknown for almost every player, if not all of them. This is new, and this is very concerning. 


The credit of the idea goes to anickle, who performed his own version of the experiment, which can be found here: 
http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9359265.page 


My experiment: 


I started sandbox mode and built water, electricity and garbage facilities, police and fire stations and a clinic. 


I built one single house, low density and low wealth, and stood obeserving them. The whole experiment is made entirely with this type of house. 


One single house, as already explained by anickle, has a pop. of 6: 4 workers, 2 shoppers and actually 2 kids that are never included in the population count. So it is safe to assume that from now on, provided sims don’t die, my workers count and my shoppers count will always be: “no. of houses x 4” (workers) or “no. of houses x 2” (shoppers). 


I kept building more houses and recording the increase in the numbers of workers and shoppers. As expected, all the numbers were perfectly fine. For a while. User marcoyim believed the pop. count started to go wrong at 500, so I tested for that, and he is absolutely right. 


This is the count of the population and the number of workers and shoppers so far: 


1 house = 6 pop, 4w + 2s; 
12 houses = 72 pop, 48w + 24s; 
53 houses = 318 pop, 212w + 106s; 
83 houses = 498 pop, 332w + 166s 


And here it goes the odd part: as the next house was finished, the population count increased by 7, not by 6. As the next house was finished, the population count increased by 10, and at the next time it increased by 12. 


BUT THE HOUSES CONTINUED WITH 6 PEOPLE (4W+2S). 


So indeed, the game adds a phantom population in the count that doesn’t really exist, and I guess I figured out the general way in which it does that. I will put the numbers as they are easier to understand by themselves. 


House 1, which would achive 500 or more in the pop count: 7 sims (6 real); 
House 2: 10; 
House 3: 12; 
House 4: 13; 
(...) 


I kept counting this for 41 houses, always subtracting the former pop count on the new one to find how many sims the game added in the pop count, while the houses always actually had 6 sims. The real progression I found was this: 


7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 16, 17, 18, 17, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 19, 18, 19, 19, 19, 20, 19, 20, 20, 21, 20, 20, 21, 21, 20, 21, 21, 21, 22, 21, 21, 22, 22, 22. 


The final house count was at 121 and the population was at 1.294, but I had 507 workers and 254 shoppers. If you do the math, I should have a little less (and 1 worker died too). It was not at the “pop x 4” and “pop x 2” ratio I told you before because 24 workers and 12 shoppers were added to the real population trough this process of adding phantom people. So as you see, they increase both real and ghost sims in our cities. 


I stopped counting there as I though I already had the general idea, and I am sure you get it too: The game adds an increasing number of sims per house to the population count, in an organized way, without ever adding these sims in your actual city. 


This is alarming, at least. It means that the game is not what is advertised (intentionally or not), it means glassbox does not process every sim individually. One can argue that each sim is technically tracked individually when it exist in the map, but that is not so true as I will continue below. 


Besides the experiment above, playing with the concepts of the game brought me insights of how the engine works and how it is flawed at every level. Here are miscellaneous things I captured while doing the whole thing: 


1. If you demolish a bulding that provides jobs, for ex. a power plant, while a worker is working, this worker is deleted along with the building. I managed to intentionally have a city with no workers by doing this. Note that I 
did it when I only had 2 houses, so I don’t know if that will ALWAYS happen. 


2. After I closed the police, fire station and clinic, 1 worker at the police and 1 at the clinic took AGES to go out. It means that if you demolish it, chances are you will lose many workers there. 


3. The game does not know how to behave when sims die: If one sim die both the pop count and the workforce go down by 1 (so far so good), but the house where he lived keeps showing 6 citizens. Worse, if those sims leave your city the count will go down further 6 points instead of 5, meaning that you actually lose 7 sims, not 6. 


4. Even if you only have 1 single house in the map, the house will show 3 kids running around it and 3 different sims appeared for me going in and out while 2 workers were at work. That means I saw 6 people + 3 kids (9 total), and these people, although (usually) maintaining their names, used different “sprites”/models each time, with no consistency at all. There was no connection with the names and “surname” of the house. The only rule was that sims that leave the house for working always had the same surname as the house. That means the sims are not “real” agents, they are randomly generated each time, with different names and models every time, provided they are not going to work. 


5. Numbers I gathered for you guys while playing: 


Commercial: 5/10L, 2/4M, 0H (I found two different values for C, I guess different buildings have different job slots. There may be more); Industrial: 20L, 6M, 0H (Again, there may be others); Wind Power Plant jobs: 20L, 6M, 0H; Sewage facility: 0L, 0M, 0H; Garbage dump: 20L, 6M, 0H; Police: 10L, 4M, 0H; Fire Dept: 20L, 6M, 0H 
Clinic: 12L, 8M, 4H.

So, how are you feeling about our great simulation game?

1363094437.0,730,self.SimCity,1a58uz,Does SimCity lack long-term objectives and a large scope?,Atranox,862,132,377,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a58uz/does_simcity_lack_longterm_objectives_and_a_large/,"Maybe it's just me, but it really seems like SimCity 2013 lacks the larger scope and long-term objectives that the prior games have.  In the previous games, I would spend **weeks** working on building up one city.  Making a successful city was both challenging and time-consuming, which is fitting for the series.

However, with the new SimCity...I just can't see how the game is going to keep people interested long-term.  The game has been out for one week, and I've already essentially ""maxed-out"" two cities.  They both have no more room to build, tons of population, loads of money and income, no unemployment, excess services, etc....there's simply nothing left to do unless I start rebuilding sections of the city just for the sake of doing it.  

The only remaining thing to do is to move on and build more cities in the region, and that can't possibly be the intended style of play...is it?  To cycle through making a new city every few days after you have nothing left to build or expand upon in your existing ones?  To a point, it just becomes tedious and forced.

SimCity is a sandbox game, so it's expected that you make your own challenges and create your own games; it doesn't need to be handed to you.  But the design now, for the first time in the series, truly limits creativity.

After making a successful city in the older games, there was still a lot to do.  You had more room to build, additional buildings you still didn't have, things to tinker with, extra ways to bring in needed income to expand, etc.  In SimCity 2013, after you make a successful city, you're simply out of space unless you want to start demolishing entire blocks of zoning.  Loads of excess income sits around with nothing to spend it on, etc.  Once cheetah speed is re-added, it's only going to make this entire process even shorter.

I don't want to recycle through common game suggestions, and it's been said time and time again, but the small map size is really awful.  I think that is the primary root of many of this game's concerns.  Additionally, there just aren't many challenging aspects of the game once you get a grasp of the mechanics.  Income-generation is really unbalanced, and it's possible to make millions of simoleons in just a day or two of play.  Regional play is a fantastic concept, but it's either broken or unreliably random in its functionality.  I think all of this comes together and turns an otherwise great game into something very shallow and very limited.

Does anyone else feel that SimCity lacks a large scope and long-term objectives?  In a month or two, do you really see yourself enjoying the game as much as the prior ones?

This is fine. Enjoyable, even. I'm a bit of a drama-whore that likes digging into the shit. Whatever. Corporate deserves it. 

But I've seen very little that resonates with me on a whole host of other game quandaries. So here goes in no particular order:

* **Land value** - high desirability should *not* just be triggered by parks and civic buildings. I want elements of the landscape itself, such as nearness to the shoreline, to add value. Makes no sense to have shacks on the waterfront and mansions in the center of town that happen to sit across from city hall.

* **Ground textures** - Ploppable objects, like parks, have grass which is colored in this rich, deep green. Undeveloped land has a hue of a much brighter green (or brown). Why the fuck? They look stupid next to each other.

* **Property shape/no autofill** - Ungainly wedges form when placing anything on an angle or a curve. These inscribed spaces yield unusable land, making it functionally pointless to ever place anything but straight and gridded structures. So, the only remaining reason to stick properties on irregular angles would be the aesthetic value - which is then hampered by the unappealing boundaries that occur between land and property. Solution, allow an auto-fill with generic objects or parklands to bring cohesion to these odd spaces.

* **Player/Regional Accountability** - the ability to grief a region by bankrupting cities or mess with other players by polluting upwind is just not good. To avoid abuse, implement a ""morality"" system for players, where during each play, region players will have the opportunity to rate and assess fairness/decency of others. Griefers will be picked out quickly, and those with low ratings will only be permitted to join ""low rated"" region games. Ratings will not be irredeemable. 

* **Resource scarcity** - this is the most instantly fixable thing I can think of. Ore shortages might make a bit of sense in a ""fuck you, it's realism"" sorta way, but it makes mining specialization somewhat pointless (keep in mind, some mines have been in operation for thousands of years in reality). Water supply diminishment is the worst example of this scarcity, it is entirely ridiculous and will ultimately doom a city. **Edit: this can be alleviated by placing a pump near a sewage treatment plant** (thanks: tyren22, vondruke00) But it is also mentioned that the treated outflow goes back into the water table (rather than the pipes, which makes little sense), you have to ensure it remains clean, and it is my contention that the ground water should not vanish so quickly, regardless. At the end of the day, introducing scarcity when you have unfinished or crippled modes of production, recovery and trade is a potentially bad idea.

* **Statistics availability** - how many people are on that bus? (**Correction: This stat is in-game** thanks, LeoPanthera).. Edit: How many commuters exist citywide vs. bus capacity? How many workers exist in that building?  Etc. etc.

* **Non-dispatchable emergency services** - I want the option to flag emergencies for police/fire/rescue vehicles. 

* **Unrealistic development rates** - If the density of my city would not sustain or justify a skyscraper, I don't want to see one yet. If I'm bled dry for workers to fill new jobs, don't keep spawning industrial buildings. For that matter, why are commercial structures appearing at all if the demand for them is zero?

* **Lack of useful, satisfying problem-solving methods** - This is the new SimCity. They could have done so much more on the creative side to handle our mayoral troubles, y'know, like the original Maxis did? How about this: **1.** Traffic woes? If you have a university with the superconductor upgrade, you can research the flying cars project. Or - **2.** Ground pollution, you need the recycling center's de-soiler poo-poo repurposer. Cleans up surface muck and produces great fertilizer for your local farms *(by the way, farms)*. **3.** Labor shortages? Play bad mayor and gain a little ""ostensibly-legitimate help"" in the form of a stream of overseas workers. Play good mayor and research the robotic assembly line project. Why should the game stick us with challenges and no way to address them?

* **No ordinances/edicts** - I want to initiate public policies with real trade-offs in the form of virtues vs. consequences. Recycling mandate: Citizens are required to sort their garbage into llama-proof recycling bins (bins themselves non-recyclable). Approval -%2; garbage yielded -15%. Or, same ordinance, city-funded sorting. -$700.00 per day; garbage yielded -15%. If an ordinance provides ONLY benefits to the city (super-ez tax forms: +1% approval, +0.5% residential tax income) then let it be a reward to mayors... instead of getting gifted with do-nothing microsoft-style achievements that no one cares about. 

* **Modifiable service and civic buildings -- that fundamentally look the same** - I want to see new skins. Variants, styles, colors. Yellow hospital. Tudor police station. Because i said so. More modification snap-points should be made to the upper floors of these structures as well, so as to make them potentially taller. Wider. As is, the city hall moddability is pretty cool, as well as the elementary school's.

* **Working educational system** - High schools and elementary schools should be required. Their coverage would then affect a drop-out vs high school graduate metric. Can't afford them? You're going to have a shitty-ass set of schools with shitty-ass students. Think institutional shack-and-brick where you rape student families for hot lunches and prom tickets. As to Colleges and Universities - their placement would impact the percentage of higher-ed graduates (obviously) which would have a direct effect on industry type, wealth demographics, protester types (fix protests!) et al. Also, we should have the ability to set *tuition and fees* which would also affect graduation rates. (Too expensive, fewer graduates.) Again, statistics.

* **Road-laying difficulties** (thanks: Hirathian) - Draw roads around a building imperfectly -- and prepare for weirdness in the form of giant odd loops, irregular positioning, or an absolute refusal to meet perpendicularly. When a player has to do incremental measurements, it's annoying. Roads should snap to structures as they do grids, and make it easy to continue in a 90 degree manner around buildings. Cross-roads are also tirelessly fussy when it comes to forming intersections if the existing road-ends aren't perfectly aligned. Or they intersect at bad angles. Solution - Roads should have a ""snap-to"" key, such as shift, which communicates the will of the player for ""straightness"" which conforms to the shape of structures and which would also fill in any gaps from roads you intend to intersect that happen to fall a bit short. Supplemental solution: ""ghost roads"" - test your layout before you commit to payment. Sort of like masking in photoshop.

* **Dynamic city changes only partially implemented** - Noticing the solar panels appearing on some structures within ""green"" cities, you start to get your hopes up about the depth of the game engine. But wasn't there supposed to be pink neon for ""gaming"" cities, gritty industrial appointments for ""dirty"" cities, etc. etc.? Are the solar panels really it? What happened to the rest of it? How about changes to roads, signs, or anything else that might convey an identity to the work you've done?

Did EA lie about how much population a city could support in this game in order to reassure the potential player-base that small tile sizes would be okay?

Check out [this](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9359265.page) thread from the Sim City forums. In particular this post:

&gt;A Low Income - Low Density House has 6 adults, 4 are workers and 2 are shoppers. 
If you destroy this home, your total population at the bottom center of your screen goes down by 6. Makes sense. 

&gt;A Low Income - Med Density House has 60 adults, 40 are workers, 20 are shoppers 
If you destroy this home, your total population at the bottom center of your screen goes down by 60. Makes sense. 

&gt;A Low Income - High Density House is where things go all whacky... By the pattern above you would assume that a high density home would be 600 adults where 400 are workers and 200 are shoppers, and this is true. If you look at the data layers (at the right times) you will see that there are indeed 600 residents and 400 are workers and 200 are shoppers.... 

&gt;BUT... 

&gt;If you destroy this High Density house, your population goes down by 5200!!!!! (As well as increasing by 5200 when it gets rebuilt) 

&gt;So either the worker/shopper count is bugged for high population buildings, OR they are purposefully ""padding"" the bottom center population numbers to make the city look bigger than it actually is. 

So what the hell? This basically confirms a lot of suspicions of mine and others that we aren't actually seeing that many sims in our cities and it also explains why only 1/10 of the population is working. We don't actually have as many people in our cities as we think! EA has stated numerous times that their internal testers were able to get cities of 500k and even 1 million sims, but in reality they may have been blowing smoke up our asses!

I assume Maxis had actually accounted for the fact people wanted to mod the game and made it seemingly easy to do from the get go. I assume they are waiting a bit until after launch to officially release tools. 

This is a very basic guide to get people who have experience in modding started. I will show you how to create a very very simple population mod to show the real values - I do not currently know if this will adjust the AI at all (I doubt it). I am unsure of the current capabilities of this but have succesfully loaded some custom javascript into the game UI etc and would like others to help explore the possibilities.

What you need to begin with:

Some Javascript knowledge.

[SimCityPak](http://community.simtropolis.com/topic/53278-simcitypak-modding-tool/)

[s3pe Development Release](http://www.den.simlogical.com/denforum/index.php?topic=1808.0)

A text editor (Preferably Sublime Text 2) - Notepad will work but will be a pain in the fucking arse. 

**What we do with SimCityPak**

We will use SimCityPak as our general .package file viewer, the reason being is because it has built in model viewer and various other functions that I personally find easier to use than s3pi (unless I am missing something obvious).

Open up SCP and navigate to the install folder of Sim City from the open file dialog. Go into the SimCityData folder - this is where most of the assets are located. Most of the files are named appropiately but the one we will be looking at is ""SimCity_Game.package"". Open that up. On the left hand side it lists all the files in the package. Have a look around and try to find interesting files. The most interesting ones are usually large in file size and are type JSON or Javascript. 

This is general information by the way and not entirely related to the basic visual mod we are going to do - its just to show you how to navigate the files for yourself. You are safe to close SimCityPak.


**On to the actual mod**

Load up S3PE and open ""SimCity_Game.package"". CLOSE ALL INSTANCES OF SIM CITY. The file we want is JSON in the TAG column and is large in file size. So click the headings at the top to sort by Filesize. As this is a generic tutorial I cant specifically say what its reference is as I have to assume it changes from patch to patch. The file we are looking for is a huge compressed javascript file which likely starts with: 

&gt; 'use strict'; var COMPILED = !0,

Here is a screenshot of the uncompressed code (Sorry only copy I have): http://i.imgur.com/hG7cy44.png

Now export that by rightclicking the line in the table and clicking Export. Load it into your text editor and if it has syntax highlighting either turn it off or change it to javascript.

To make the code at all readable I recommend you plop it into http://jsbeautifier.org/ (making sure you turn off the fancy text box or prepare for mass lag).

And replace the code on there with your code. 

Now you have 100% editable UI/Whatever else is in there code. For this quick tutorial we are going to find the line that starts with

&gt; simcity.GetFudgedPopulation() = function


I assume you know how to edit javascript so it should be self explanitory but two lines after put 

&gt; return a;

Save the file, hop back on over to s2pe and right click the line in the table with the unmodified code and click ""Replace"", find your new file that you edited and replace with it. Now click File &gt; Save - wait until it finishes - and make sure you close s3pe before loading up sim city to test it out. 

If you did it correctly your cities and I guess other peoples cities should now be showing the *actual* population


**Wrapping up**

As I said this is a generic ""off the press"" sort of tutorial not designed to do anything other than show people how it can be done on a very basic scale and see what other people can come up with with more time.

1364151641.0,601,self.SimCity,1axcpx,I am a very patient person but this game has broken me.,djcrs1,750,149,224,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1axcpx/i_am_a_very_patient_person_but_this_game_has/,"So here is the experience that finally convinced me to give up on this terrible game:

I experimented with various city layouts and economies for well over 100 hours. I also read this and other forums and watched many youtube videos to learn about shortcuts and problems from others. As someone with programming and server cluster experience, I understood some of the challenges facing this game and I maintained a positive attitude while making it as fun as possible and just laughing at the sim behavior and server behavior stupidites.

After trashing many cities, regions and great works, I was ready for my ""keeper"" - a region to invest in for the long haul. I chose Reflection Atoll because so many cities are connected to the great work.

I started an oil-fuel city to support my region, followed by a coal-ore-metal-alloy city. I used profits from these cities to found two tourist/gambling cities which have beautiful street layouts, huge landmarks and every amenity. However they were barely profitable. 

I then began diverting my exports to the great work International Airport. I had not yet completed this one before. My plan was to support my region by tourism and gambling since my natural resources were running out. I have gone down the long boring path of consumer electronics before and I found it to be a trade port micro and tree planting simulator in the long run.

I began to export the natural resources oil, metal and alloy to the great work and finished it in record time. I then went and ""cut the ribbon"" in each city and made sure the great work was working properly from each. 

Now I began spending some time in my tourist cities to prepare for the onslaught of tourists! I noticed the international airport closed then repoened a few times due to criminals?! I had sent plently of services there so I just gave it a few days to stabilize. Finally my big airport was up and running for three days uninterrupted. Time to check the stats!

Now before the International Airport, my two tourist cities had around 30k pop and 50k tourists each. After the great work... 30k pop and 50k tourists. What??? How many tourists am I getting from the airport: 450 each! Not 450k - Four Hundred Fifty! Versus the 50 thousand I already had. Really? Oh I have plenty of taxis flooding my streets now but the real impact to my tourism and income was nil.

OK keep a positive attitude. I already have lots of tourists. The airport is just cosmetic and part of the ""immersion"" then. No problem. Let's start figuring out how to maximize these tourist towns so they can support the region.

On a sidenote, I had intended to run these tourist cities with full utilities and services from the industry cities. Makes sense to keep my prime real estate here free from sewer plants right? As we all know this just plain doesn't work and I ended up having to plop down a nuclear plant right next to my three ferry landings, and a garbage dump by the two double decker bus terminals.

But I digress.

I remembered to place down my casinos near to the event centers and landmarks in the center of the map so that the entering and exiting tourists would be drawn in. Upon watching more closely, I saw that over 90% of these exiting sims take the exact same roads out of the city center and do not directly pass a casino. Very few diverged even half a block to stumble upon my choice of massive casinos.

Ok fine. I demolish two city blocks of prime residential 3/3 real estate so I can place a new big casino directly on the one exit path the sims use to leave the one particular event center I was looking at. I realized I would need to do the same for the areas around my other event centers and cities also.

I wait for the next event to exit... all the sims hit the streets... and proceed to walk right past my shiny new casino because it is not on their side of the street! So they won't visit my casino unless I place it not only directly on their exiting street, but also directly on their side of that street. 

So do I demolish my nice Empire State Building to adapt to this new information??? No! For the first (and likely last) time I just immediately exit the game. I truly give up unless Maxis makes drastic changes to this terrible broken game. What kind of ""freedom of city design"" do I really have when I am so restricted by these programmed behaviors that there is only one location to make my casino profitable. While I have not yet lost any cities due to server errors, I really wish this region would get corrupted or deleted so I can just pretend this experience never actually happened. 

Yes I can reorganize my cities so all the tourist entrance and exit paths lead right by a casino, on their side of the street. Yes I can start a new better region bearing this in mind from the beginning. Yes I should have read about the International Airport beforehand so I wasn't so disappointed. But you know what? I just don't care anymore. The frustration vs fun ratio of this game has officially passed the balancing point for me.

I like a challenge. I play Starcraft 2 ladder. My Skyrim has over 200 mods. I am starting to play SimCity 4 now (although I feel dirty giving Maxis any more money). But this game is no challenge and offers no freedom. It is an exercise in futility at its core. I refuse to play it again in its current state: not out of principle, but out of respect for my own time and mental state.

I understand that you have put work into the game, but I'd like to believe that this whole mess is not your fault. I'm a developer myself and I can totally imagine corporate  politics messed up this game. It is clear that you guys had to release it before it was actually finished. By looking at how much detail you put into some aspects of the game, it really hurts me to see all the unfinished game mechanics, the tiny map sizes, the broken agent system, and so on. Looking at that broken mess, many of us are able to see the magnificent game it was supposed to be, which makes it even harder to bear with it now.

Same goes for ""the big patch"". I really believe you wanted to fix whats broken, I really believe your topmost priority is giving an enjoyable game experience to players, heck, you probably wouldn't be a game developer in the first place if this was not your intention, but I kind of think EA is not letting you put as much manpower to work as you might need. 


As a guy who played the original Sim City on an Atri, later on a SNES, I have nothing but fond memories of the game series. Hell, I even let my SNES run over night, secretly, so my parents wouldn't notice that damn bright red light during the night, just so the next day I have enough money to build a huge city. The first game I played on my computer was Sim City 2000, I just loved it. Same goes for 3000 and 4, both which I played religiously. It is hard to count the time I played this game in hours, probably it would be easier counting it in years.

Well, at least thanks for reminding me what a great game Sim City used to be. You guys are responsible for a lot of great childhood memories, surely not just for mine. But bear in mind: Sim City 5 destroyed many of these mmories and gave, probably not only me, nothing but a bitter taste to maybe the best game series so far.

I really really hope there will be a next city building game from you guys, hopefully not restricted by whatever politics you are bound to play by now.

I've had other things to occupy my time and just felt like it might be better in a week or two.

Last night, after getting back in town after a week, I went to play the game again. Lo and behold a new message, never before seen on Origin, popped up and said that I needed to re-verify my game. I went ahead and did it using the key Amazon provided but it didn't work. Instead the game disappeared from my Origin library. I thought maybe a glitch was happening so I decided to wait until this morning.

I tried to chat with Origin support at 8 and didn't get connected until 9. I answered all the support questions and they verified everything about my account. Then my Indian friend said ""You have filed a chargeback and/or you purchased was deemed fraud.""

I tried to tell him that I haven't even been in town to play the game or issue a chargeback but all he would do was say, ""nothing more can be done regarding this issue"". 

I hope this is an isolated incident but as a word of caution, and another wonderful layer to this huge fuckup, I felt inclined to warn you.

This is a deep and storied franchise with a dedicated and highly (for the most part) thoughtful and intelligent fanbase.

That said, I think it's time to clear the air.  There's a significant amount of confusion around this game.  The mechanics of which *seem* intuitive however don't exactly do that.  A lot of us think we know how the game works, only to find out that despite planning, things just don't work (for whatever reason).  Things like a commercial building sitting between two ""profit/busy shopper"" buildings, yet without shoppers of their own.  How one car can change lanes and hold up an entire highway?  Why all-residential cities work at all?  Why one-way streets aren't in the game? so on and so forth.  We've all seen some pretty odd (and many recurring things).


It shouldn't be a lynching nor should it be a grand jury.  I'd hope that participants would be as civil as possible.  Prior to release this sub saw Maxis activity, now it has become a pit viper nest.  I'd hate to see this sub become completely devoid of Maxis members discussing the game with the inquisitive aspect of this community that's actually looking to play their game and get the most out of it.  I can't speak for everyone, but it seems to me that players just want to know what the heck is going on exactly, or at least why somethings aren't working.  ANYTHING besides these canned and ambiguous blog ""updates"" which say everything while saying nothing at all.  Help us by helping us *understand*.

I really hope this can happen.

*EDIT:  I've read all of the comments throughout the day as they came in, and figured I would comment again myself.  As much as I'd love to see positive discourse between community and developer (after all, what better way to get a handle on future development than by using the playing community as a barometer), it won't be happening.  I never really thought it would when I made the post.  What I did know was that the sub would do what it's been doing and continue to show its lack of confidence in both developer and publisher, since they sadly have become interchangeable.  I think it's interesting that this would have an 81% upvote yet nearly 100% negative comments, I'm assume that this is because people want Maxis/EA (one in the same, see!) to see their vote of no confidence.  I figured that if I had created the subject and let it ride, which it did, maybe a PR rep would see the fact that even in a situation like an AMA, a no holds barred form of questioning where commenters would expect transparency, this particular subreddit would have no faith in Maxis delivering answers it so desperately needs/wants.  Even though this is only a small slice of SC mayors, it's still a sizeable community that represent a cross-section of players.* **Free games don't replace the game we originally wanted to play.

I only recently noticed that the true multiplayer SimCity, *SimCity 2000 Network Edition*, released way back in 1996, doesn't work correctly on any of the NT-based versions of Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8) and I happened to be capable of fixing that. So, for those that just want to give it a whirl, scroll down for the download link that will automate the install and patch process; for those that want more details, read on:

Upon initial inspection, the type of hang and crash looked like an IPC issue. I opened up the executables with a hex editor, scrambled the mutex and semaphore names, and sure enough, that got things slightly working. It then became obvious that there were more issues that were arising due to differences between Windows 95, which the game had been programmed for, and the NT line of Windows. The client was running 3 threads at full tilt, maxing out 3 cores of my CPU, and the server was doing the same with 1 thread. I simply added in some clumsy sleeps to fix the maxed out threads. I then did a slightly more proper job of clobbering the mutex and semaphore scheme in use and let the game just rely on TCP/IP even for a local client; a side benefit is you can now run multiple clients on one computer, so you can play 4 player by yourself. I then discovered some very nasty flaws in the server that allowed a client to crash the server very easily (so easily that a client might do so accidentally), so I fixed those up too. I used an XP SP2+ feature called registration-free COM to get the game's newspaper and help utility functioning again (though only owners of the full retail game benefit from this; the trial version just uses the newspaper and help utility as advertisements).

I then made some usability improvements so that the game was more bearable to play, namely the way error messages are displayed. The installers are all 16-bit, so I had to come up with a proper way to cope with that if I was going to share this with anyone running a 64-bit version of Windows. I set up an automation script to try and make getting things up and running as easy as possible and so here we are!

Extract to a folder and run _setup.cmd; it will prompt you with a y/n with instructions for files it needs. If you don't want to trust a batch file to download files for you, then don't; if you answer no, it will then offer you a URL for a webpage to download the files from yourself. Neither SimCity 2000 Network Edition installer that are used for installation are actually executed; they're extracted manually since they're 16-bit and won't run on 64-bit Windows.

Run the server first, select File &gt; Start New Game, then run the client, select Join Game, and connect to yourself (127.0.0.1). Be sure to enter a name (if left blank, the server will reject you saying the name is already in use).

Once in game, you have to buy land before you can build on it. To buy land, use the bottom button on the left.

If you start a selection action but want to cancel it, hold SHIFT when letting go of left click to abort the action.

When you first start, plop down a power plant, a short road, zone industrial and residential within 3 squares of the road, and make sure to run power lines.

Don't forget that most power plants have a lifespan of 50 years.

The initial client connection seems to take longer the higher the ping between server and host is, but once connected, the game performs pretty fantastically.

Turtle speed is 1 month per 30 seconds, llama is 1 month per 15 seconds, cheetah is 1 month per 10 seconds, and african swallow seems to be 1 month per ~6 seconds. I'd recommend cheetah or african swallow.

Good luck keeping your finances in the black on your first few tries; this game can be hard.

What's the deal with showing it off when it doesn't work? 

You guys have been completely silent on this. 

Edit: I have been informed that the guy in charge of the online part of the game, Derrick Schneider, left Maxis shortly after release. So apparently his team is left to pick up the pieces of his project that he failed to make sure actually worked in any capacity. 

Edit 2: **A developer has PMed me about this, asking for specifics. I would love it if you guys who have also experienced this (read: all of you) would post what your experiences are in this thread, and include server/region/origin name/etc information.**

 Here's what I said-

&gt;Stuff like fire trucks, garbage collection, etc are a lot more uncommon. But things like power, water, sewage services being unavailable for minutes or even real world hours before the game finally recognizes that other cities are providing them is a very common thing. And of course great work contributions/great works in general. Start one in one city and other cities show an empty great work plot. Finish one in that first city and other cities show they're incomplete (and still send resources to them, losing those resources forever). 

Edit 3: Obviously things not working at all is unintentional, [but it appears that a lag between updates is.](http://i.imgur.com/myE4U27.png) Apparently the game wasn't built to have 1:1 communication between cities to begin with, despite recent claims that such communication makes up for the small city sizes, and despite *literally every single player's expectations.*

It would add a lot to the end game, since instead of maxing out your money and not knowing what to do after that, you would be working in the long term to scrape together enough money to buy that plot that will let you expand your commercial district or that other one with a bunch of oil that you need underneath. It seems that this game is in need of a money sink like that right now.

It could also add an interesting dimension of competition to the game if your city and one controlled by a neighboring player are both interested in the same land. Plus, it would be realistic—real-life cities often do swallow up surrounding land as they become more significant. If land can be bought in smallish parcels, cities will end up with interesting and realistic borders for the first time in SimCity history.

Using bribes and threats is exactly how EA operates when it comes to suppressing highly negative attention (or generating positive attention). So, was it free DLC for life? A trip to the studios? Exclusivity on something or other? You think this would be below EA? Think again. This subreddit is generating a lot of traffic, and the first thing people see when they get here is a whole load of very angry people.

Remove the 'angry' threads. Replace them with people who look like they're 'fans' discussing the game in a civil manner, with the harshest thing being constructive criticism. Doesn't seem like such a huge problem anymore, eh? Great success!

Are EA and Maxis too fragile to stand up to harsh scrutiny? Are they just little boys being bullied, and do they need protection from the big bad internet? Are their lies and deceit built on such a foundation of sand, that a few harsh discussions are seen as such a threat?

Does it matter if I'm just speculating? Can I have my free speech?

Edit:

RE: people calling some of us 'conspiracy nutjobs'. You must have missed the part where I literally admitted that I was 'just speculating', not making any solid claims.

The point is that actions such as these could easily be seen as colluding with EA, even if that's not what it is.

Who cares if this subreddit is shitty for a while? That's the state of SimCity, unfortunately. All the negative attention will go away when/if EA fix their mess. They certainly don't deserve any sympathy until they do. The mods here seem to care more about keeping up the appearance of their subreddit (and the contact they enjoy with SimCity developers -- who probably threatened to stop coming here), rather than the interests of the franchise in the long term.

Trying to play 'house' and attempting to keep things tidy when there's a disaster out there is irresponsible. This subreddit should reflect the situation with SimCity. Only EA and Maxis can fix that -- not moderation or censorship. People have every right to be angry, and should continue to be angry in order to protect their consumer interests. This, along with voting with your wallet, is the only way they'll understand that a lot of us won't take their shit anymore.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1363610125.0,,,True,t3_1aicdc,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1aicdc/so_what_did_maxisealucy_bradshaw_offer_as_a_bribe/,

1. Traffic uses simple shortest route with no weight for traffic or road type.

2. Firetrucks all go to same fire even if there are multiple happening.

5. Amount of jobs specialization buildings create depends on you city size. For example mine built in 5000 population city creates x jobs while  mine built in 100 000 population city creates 20x jobs.

6. Buildings tend to work at 100% efficiency even when there is not enough people to fill the jobs.

7. Commercial buildings work just fine without any freight.

# They reverse direction somewhat arbitrarily after picking people up.  We suspect it's because of where the passengers want to go.

They don't know where they are going, there is absolutely no intelligence in their movements.  They don't go to full stops, they don't go from commerce to residential.  They go forward, randomly choose a direction if presented with a choice, and flip the other way periodically after picking people up.

I had rather foolishly put street car intersections (mostly T intersections) into my city so the light rail could get where it needed to go, big loops to allow them to go wherever they needed, but it wasn't working.  I'd see 16 street cars on the same street and 4 blocks away 1000s of people standing around at stops, not picked up.

The key to light rail is ZERO intersections.  The street cars need to only be able to go 1 way, a snaked rail path through the entire city.  They will leave the depot going a random direction (ideally the station is at the end of the line) and travel along the line until they are full, then they will flip to the other side of the track and go back the other way.  It looks like this: http://imgur.com/EdXSvQk

With no intersections, you do not run afoul of their random code and the entire city is covered.  I dropped the average wait time on my light rail for 232 minutes to 12 minutes in the same city by just doing this.  It takes time for them to spread out, but after awhile they cover all stops along the line such that folks aren't waiting overly long.

Edit: After more analysis (clicking on the car shows how many are on it, they hold 200), I've realized that they don't just flip when they are full, they flip for other reasons I've yet to determine.  Without the intersections they do spread out nicely and none of my stops have many people in them, and no street car is carrying &gt; 100 people, but now I am not sure why they flip.

1362785518.0,432,self.SimCity,19xx7d,Trying some technical analysis of the server situation,fuckyouimbritish,504,72,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19xx7d/trying_some_technical_analysis_of_the_server/,"Okay, I'm looking for input on this working theory of what's going on.  I may well be wrong on specifics or in general.  Some of this is conjecture, some of it is assumption.

What we know:

* The SimCity servers are [hosted on Amazon EC2](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/c8rsfkv).

* The ops team have, in the time since the US launch, added 4 servers: EU West 3 and 4, EU East 3 and Oceanic 2 (sidenote: I would be mildly amused if they got to the point of having an Oceanic 6).

* Very little data is shared between servers, if any.  You must be on the same server as other players in your region; the global market is server-specific; leaderboards are server-specific.

* A major issue in the day(s) following launch was [database replication lag](https://twitter.com/derricks/status/309282958668341248).

This means that each 'server' is almost certainly in reality a cluster of EC2 nodes, each cluster having its own shared database.  The database itself consists of more than one node, apparently in a master-slave configuration.  Writes (changes to data) go in to one central master, which performs the change and transmits it to its slaves.  Reads (getting data) are distributed across the slaves.

* The client appears to be able to simulate a city while disconnected from the servers.  I've experienced this myself, having the disconnection notice active for several minutes while the city and simulation still function as normal.

* Trades and other region sharing functionality often appears to be delayed and/or broken.

* While connected, a client seems to send and receive a relatively small amount of data, [less that 50MB an hour](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/107699/how-much-data-does-simcity-transfer).

* The servers implement some form of client action validation, whereby the client synchronises its recent actions with the server, and the server checks that those actions are valid, choosing to accept them or force a rollback if it rejects them.

So the servers are responsible for:

1. Simulating the region
2. Handling inter-city trading
3. Validating individual client actions
4. Managing the leaderboards
5. Maintaining the global market
6. Handling other sundry social elements, like the region wall chat

The admins have disabled leaderboards.  More tellingly, they have slowed down the maximum game speed, suggesting that - if at a city level the server is only used for validation - that the number of actions performed that require validation is overwhelming the servers.

What interests me is that the admins have been adding capacity, but seemingly by adding new clusters rather than adding additional nodes within existing clusters.  The latter would generally be the better option, as it is less dependent on users having to switch to different servers (and relying on using user choice for load balancing is extremely inefficient in the long term).

That in itself suggests that each cluster has a single, central point of performance limitation.  And I wonder if it's the master database.  I wonder if the fundamental approach of server-side validation, which requires both a record of the client's actions and continual updates, is causing too many writes for a single master to handle.  I worry that this could be a core limitation of the architecture, one which may take weeks to overcome with a complete and satisfactory fix.

Such a fix could be:

* Alter the database setup to a multi-master one, or reduce replication overhead.  May entail switching database software, or refactoring the schema.  Could be a huge undertaking.

* Disable server validation, which consequent knock-on effect of a) greater risk of cheating in leaderboards; b) greater risk of cheating / trolling in public regions; c) greater risk of modding / patching out DRM.

* Greatly reduce the processing and/or data overhead for server validation (and possibly region simulation).  May not be possible; may be possible but a big undertaking; may be a relatively small undertaking if a small area of functionality is causing the majority of the overhead.

Edit: I just want to add something I said in a comment: Of course it is still entirely possible that the solution to the bottleneck is relatively minor.  Perhaps slaves are just running out of RAM, or something is errantly writing excessive changes, causing the replication log to balloon in size, or there're too many indexes.

It could just be a hard to diagnose issue, that once found, is a relatively easy fix. One can only hope.

Notes

* **New:** Added more Hotel models to increase hotel variety.
* **Traffic:** Updated routing system to improve traffic. Routing system now understands more information about u-turns, required vehicle stops, and vehicle behavior on certain road types. This should make traffic smarter.
* **Traffic:** Commercial and industrial buildings stagger their work shifts to start throughout commute hours instead of at the top of the hour. This should reduce traffic.
* **Traffic:** Fixes one issue where a car won't move causing traffic to back up behind it.
* **Traffic:** Vehicles can now make right turns on Red. This should improve some cases of traffic.
* **Traffic:** Trading polish that will improve regional traffic when one city has a lot of jobs and its neighboring city has a lot of workers.
* **Air Pollution:** Fixed more issues where cities that placed air polluting buildings received large amounts of air pollution from unknown sources.
* **Service Vehicles:** Fix for disappearing service vehicles on cities that whose vehicles had disappeared before update 2.
* **School Buses:** Fix for issue where school buses were getting stuck at neighbor's city or arcology.
* **Audio:** Tuned audio on French Police Station.
* **Trading:** Fixed issue where fire servers were not trading consistently between Brakeman's Folly and Twain in Whitewater Valley.
* **Trading:** Sewage trading: Sewage will now take a more direct route to regional sewage plant instead of throughout the city.
* **Trading:** Made gifting more reliable.
* **Ferry Terminal:** Ferry Terminal can now send its sewage to the output pipe and treatment plant.
* **RCI Tuning:** Fixed issue where sims going to a park via transit would sometimes lose their money or happiness on the way home.
* **RCI Tuning:** Bulldozing abandoned or rubble buildings will now prevent new developments for 6-12 hours.
* **RCI Tuning:** Less Happiness is taken from wealth 2 and 3 buildings when rent is due when no money is present.
* **RCI Tuning:** Fix for issue some users experienced where buildings would stay abandoned because moving trucks would not be able to move in.
* **Trees:** Trees now last longer, but also do not eliminate as much ground pollution.
* **Radiation:** Radiation causes less ground pollution than previously.
* **Transit:** Changed thought bubble suggestion to add more trains to deal with crowded passenger trains to suggest that you add more train stations.
* **Transit:** Improvements to lights to make rail look better at night.
* **Transit:** Streetcar stops can now be placed directly on standalone streetcar tracks, and passengers can walk along the tracks to them.
* **Transit:** Tuned the chance buses or streetcars will go to high-traffic stops first as a minor traffic improvement.
* **Roads:** University pedestrian paths can now cross streets.
* **Manufacturing Trucks:** Fixed issue some users experienced where manufacturing trucks left the city and were lost permanently.
* **Delivery Trucks:** Fixed issue where some users would experience a loss of resources is their delivery trucks returned to garages without proper storage.
* **Sports Parks:** Tuned the amount of skateboarders and neighborhood athletes at the sports parks.
* **Data Layers:** Zones are now visible in heavy data layers.
* **Edit Mode:** Added more valid snap points in edit mode. This improvement is most noticeable on Parks.
* **Buildings:** Addressed some cases where buildings would stack on one another. ",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1367880636.0,,,True,t3_1dtn8g,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1dtn8g/simcity_update_30_comes_later_this_week_changelog/,

**Fix Suggestions:**

*u\binaryrage's suggestion for traffic: (Note: I don't know if it'll work for all the bigger cities)*

* On traffic - use high density roads back one intersection. It'll add traffic lights and avoid the worst of the flareups. I have a 60K city with almost no traffic and the only transport I have is street cars down one main avenue.

*u\Hive_64 suggestion for random crashes:*

* If you get the random crash and loss of progress, try disabling Origin in game (ctrl + f1 in game, options there, disable origin in-game). Next, restart your client. I kept crashing every ~20 minutes when I would start a game and this fixed it for me.

**Launch Issues:**

* Unable to see Origin friends in game
* Keep being forced to complete tutorial
* Servers being full
* Second city keep crashing
* Cities desyncing, not processing properly and forcing you to rollback, or in extreme cases abandon the city
* Cities disappearing entirely from the region
* Clock disappeared
* Changing speeds no longer worked 
* Random crash
* Trades don't occur properly between cities
* In game chat doesn't work. Region invitations don't show up in game, need to exit to see it.
* All options for the in game menu don't load.
* Origin only downloads about 286 MBs worth of data, then doesn't play properly. Even with multiple installs/uninstalls and only way to fix so far is to install via DVD and not through Origin.


*u\shadowclaimer's crashes:*

* Crash 1 - City claimed, started construction, believe it crashed when connected to region, 3 other cities + International Airport in works (Reproduced in Crash 2)
* Crash 2 - City claimed, started construction, believe it crashed when connected to region, 3 other cities + International Airport in works
* Crash 3 - Opened recyclables map in city with tons of recyclables.
* Crash 4 - Placed School of Business, opened Budget, Budget opened then crashed.
* Crash 5 - Random Crash, completely random
* Crash 6 - Crash 1/2 similar, basically starting any new city when the servers are being weird/slow tends to blow up and crash. My girlfriend had this bug for about an hour trying to start new cities, claimed like 3 different plots, all of them crashed.


**Game Bugs:**

* No Railroad - Discovery Delta has a city with no railroad connection but a railroad that stops at a bridge (the Island City)
* City to city trades are late, slow or not occuring at all
* AI services (firetrucks, ambulances) don't ""cheat"" around traffic and get around them
* Cars driving in circles with no reason
* Service cars (police, fire, dump, etc.) distribution seems off, they often drive in a pack which decreases the overall range
* AI always takes the shortest route, never the fastest or best (traffic-dependent)
* Accidents aren't handled properly by emergency services
* Unable to build ploppables on top of fences, barrels etc. leftover from previously demolished items.
* Great works do not update resource count until all players in the region exit.
* Additions to Great Hall do not translate over to the entire region. Build a department of transportation, but neighbors couldn't build train stations. Same with dept. of education as well.
* Not enough rain to refill water supply

*u\shadowclaimer's minor bug reportings:*

* Recycling Center - Metal Reclaimation Lines are too wide, if placed first you cannot place anything else, if placed last its fine.
* Road Connections - Are broken whenever elevation is involved, gets really screwy, leads to really inconvenient creations

* Traffic - Has something wrong with it, I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, but out of 6+ cities, each with different road layouts/road density/avenue-no avenue bits, I hit massive massive traffic backup.s Huge bus networks, trains, planes, etc. did NOT help.
* Magical Criminals - Loaded my city, dozens of criminals, they were wrecking my city and spiraling it down. I join my neighboring one and all those criminals unload off a train into it (like 20-30 criminals into a city with usually 0). I capture most of them/the rest board the train to leave. When I log back on my other city, they're all gone. Whether intentional/a bug or not, its absolutely absurd.

*u\macellan's minor bug reportings:*

* Traffic seriously fubar. Locked intersections, cars not moving at all when they can, sitting at intersections.
* $ Sims not using mass transit, filling streets, adding to traffic AI problems. 
* International/cultural digital deluxe set not changing buildings to look like target country.
* Can't claim cities in my own private zone.
* Streetcars wander, no logic, over hit one area, completely ignore another. Riders/day bugs at a number and never changes.
* Road bugs when starting a city, can't connect to main road.
* Mass transit keeps getting stuck at one number. Population dropped from 220k to 32k and 7687 riders for buses, 18598 riders for light rail is stuck and does not change.

**Graphical Issues:**

* The roads disappear at certain zoom levels
* Roads underwater
* Driveways connecting to roads vertically
* Buildings on avenues
* Ploppables not graphically connecting to roads properly (eg: Tram depot)
* Buildings on top of other buildings
* Viridian Hills Region, Tosca Cliffs: passenger ferry dock can be plopped but never connected to your road infrastructure

1366320859.0,415,self.SimCity,1cmu9s,I've avoided raging about this game... until now.,MemeHermetic,498,83,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1cmu9s/ive_avoided_raging_about_this_game_until_now/,"So I sat quietly through the announcement of always on DRM.
I sighed to myself at broken servers on release.
I shook my head at 4 hour queues.
I shrugged at constant rollbacks.
I kept my aggravation to myself over regions that don't connect.
I even kept my mouth shut at broken recycling, traffic, trade depots and electronics plants.

But then today. Today I log on and finish working on my new tourism city. I sent a gift of 10M to the new town. Built everything I needed. Airport, ferry, bus terminal, schools, expo center, arena, tourist attractions, hostpital, fire station, police precinct, an incredibly complex road system with a well thought out street car system. Power, water and sewage. Built up residential and booming commercial. 96% approval rating. 

Then I got booted from the server. When I logged back in, it was all gone. All of it. The only thing still there were about three roads I laid down in the beginning. All gone. And to top it all off, the start up money was nowhere to be seen. I built my city hall back up and waited for the gift to show again. Nothing. Gone into the aether. 

The thing that really pissed me off? What sent me over the edge? This would have never happened, I would have never wasted all that time, if I could SAVE LOCALLY. But hey. Maybe later I'll go buy some fucking Crest so I can feel better about things. This game is fucking pathetic. 

**EDIT and UPDATE:** 
First off to anyone to anyone saying ""where's the proof"" I simply have to ask... are you serious? I'm not trying to tell anyone I saw Bigfoot or discovered free energy! I'm talking about problems in a game that has been discussed at length, displayed across the web and recognized by the creators of said game. You're not on the verge of uncovering some grand scheme of the Society of the Interwebz, sorry Hercule Poirot.

Second, a few people suggested ways to deal with the rollback. Problem was this wasn't a rollback at all. It literally just reset my town. I haven't been booted since that happened, and I ended up sending yet another ten million from my other town and starting from the ground up. So far it seems alright. It's only been running for a couple of (realtime) hours though, where before it ran for I believe 6, so here's hoping nothing happens. 

I will say this. Overall, the game has improved. The changes they made to the traffic issue are working (not ideal but far and away better than before). Trade depots are glitching less, and recycling plants even less than that. Region connection is working 80% of the time vs the 40-50% we saw at release. The game is getting better. It is NOT at the level to be expected of a $60-$80 dollar game yet, and realistically with the AlwaysOn, city size and DLC schemes, I don't know that it ever will be, but at least it's getting better. That being said, the original post here was made because you can only grin and bear a succession of fuck ups for so long and today I hit my limit, and wanted feedback to my situation directly. Which I've gotten in spades, and I thank you for. ",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1366336843.0,,,True,t3_1cmu9s,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1cmu9s/ive_avoided_raging_about_this_game_until_now/,

After two days of unsuccessful log on attempts at launch, I emailed Amazon to see if I could get a refund for the game. I was told that they were not giving refunds for SimCity and that I should contact EA. A day later, I was finally able to log on, so I started playing. Game-crippling bugs aside, it was fun. I only lost two cities to server disconnections.

Tonight, I tried to log on and got a message asking me to enter my activation code. Once I did that, I got another message saying that the code was already in use.

No problem. Happens all the time in software, right? So I get on a chat with EA. After a loooooong wait, the rep says, ""Sorry, but Amazon issued a chargeback, so we disabled your game."" I asked if they were sure, because I saw no such refund from Amazon. They repeated the same sentence and then asked if I wanted anything else.

I immediately called Amazon. The person on the line was very helpful. Apparently, EA is doing this to a lot of Amazon download codes whether the person asked for a refund or not. Amazon never asked EA to chargeback the money. He said if any refunds were given, it was only on Amazon's side because it was such a freaking mess of a launch. He said Amazon called EA about it and EA is ""aware of the issue"" and will be re-enabling the accounts sometime in the next day or so.

Eff that.

I asked the Amazon guy for my money back and he happily obliged. Amazon, I'm a customer for life. EA, you will never see my money again.

TL;DR - EA is disabling the game for some people that downloaded from Amazon even though no refunds were given. Amazon is boss. EA is run by maniacs.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,True,t3_1abtky,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1abtky/ea_disabling_simcity_for_some_amazon_orders_and/,

Traffic is bugged as hell. Call it bad A.I. if you like, but it's just plain bugged. No matter what, traffic will always take the shorter route. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHdyzx_ecbQ

Busses, and garbage trucks back up traffic for blocks. Emergency vehicles sit for hours in backed up traffic, and when they are at a fire scene they block all the traffic behind them. Emergency vehicles have **zero** priority in emergencies. Busses are required to help alleviate traffic problems, but in my experience they just cause more of them by blocking up the streets! When all this piles on top of each other, and garbage trucks cant reach the buildings guess what... fires and sickness. Guess what cant make it to the buildings to remedy this because garbage trucks are in the way? You guessed it.

 I understand planning and thinking ahead is part of this game, but I should not have to resort to gimmicky solutions to this horrid A.I. I should not have to make a snake pattern with trams and never allow an intersection. The only way to get about 200k (that I know of) with horrible, yet stable traffic problems is to ""zig-zag"" your avenue so there are absolutely NO intersections at all. What the heck kind of ""planning"" is this? It's not planning, it's **broken**.

That's just traffic concerns! So many times when I have workers of the available education and class, business and factories just randomly shut down. The building happiness is also broke, look at examples like this that are popping up everywhere:
http://imgur.com/D5RPmDc

Taxes mean nothing when you can run -40k and still make a crapton of money. Mining / Oil town are fundamentally broken. There is currently a flaw that makes what is to be finite resources infinite. 

EA and Maxis, please fix this game. I have been waiting and anticipating this game for ages. I am very disappointed that you guys would release what I call a broken game. There is no way you guys did not know about this, and there was no way for us to test it with the ""betas"" that you guys provided for us. Failure to launch right away, meh... releasing a fundamentally broken game that you knew was broken? Unacceptable.

They don't fundamentally change the game in some way and I don't believe they are worth 15% of the base cost of the game.

I don't have a problem DLC. I like that you're adding in stuff to continue bring change to the game - but at this price? I've now spent nearly $80 on SimCity since its release. I love the game, but there's no game out there where I'd say ""yeah, I'm willing to spend $80 on that."" 

I feel these prices should have been much lower considering the base cost of the game - or the base cost should have been much lower. Example: iOS games don't cost $10, then another $2 every time they want you to buy some kind of add-on.

If I buy a map DLC for Call of Duty or Battlefield, I'm doing so because it gives me something new to play the game in. Not just a single map, but a few of them. In SimCity we're literally getting one new thing for 15% cost of the game. It's a little absurd.

A final point  raised by /u/Schwagadelic, it would have been great if you guys released some DLC that was attainable not only by spending a lot of money - but by playing the game. Make them hard or expensive (in simoleons) to unlock, but make it possible. Maybe not for everything, but  at least something to reward those putting a lot of time into the game.",Suggestion,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1372197450.0,sugg,,True,t3_1h2d91,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1h2d91/to_maxisea_please_reconsider_costs_of_dlc/,

Broken game features and servers that need to be patched, whatever, those can all be patched in the future, these things aren't new or unique.

What really ticks me off? What **really** made me get a refund?

**The game is an insult to my intelligence.**

The same intelligence I used to sink hundreds of hours into SC3K and SC4. The same intelligence I used to mod the living crap out of SC4 and minmax my cities in an ultimately futile attempt to replicate Magnasanti.

What Lucy McFuckFace is doing now with her **infuriatingly** single-minded PR releases? What the dev team did with things like getfudgedpopulation and dumb traffic?

These things insult me not as a gamer, but as an intelligent individual who seeks to get the most out of his games. I feel like I'm being treated like some 50-year-old Facebook mom.

Fuck you, Maxis. You want to know why this is all exploding in your face and you didn't get away with it? SimCity fans were never 50-year-old Facebook mothers. They were young, intelligent adults who found in your games a thoughtful and deep simulation that challenged us.

Dumb pathfinding, seemingly random agent behavior is one thing. But now with claims of the 10% of the population being worker/shopper bug when buildings go high density, number of workers not scaling upwards with growing commercial and industrial, making any chances of balancing the RCI a pipe dream.

The trade economy is broken, the ratio of residential job seekers to commerical/industrial jobs is broken when it reaches high density, larger cities are crippled by faulty traffic logic, inter-regional cooperation becomes a bigger problem because of the one and only chokepoint they supply to you per plot.

Who is EA/Maxis trying to fool here? Probably 8 out of 10 Simcity players love maths, ~~jerk off at bar graphs~~, and are all capable of experimenting and calculating precisely the faults of the game. Some of the faults will be dismissed as ""features"" than actual bug, which pisses me off the most. The longer you play, the worse the game is, with fault after fault slowly but surely becoming glaring issues that forces players to play the game in one true way; **no high density structures, roads are constricted to optimal layouts, and a huge focus on export.**

While 'deep' simulation is relative, I feel like I've been cheated, lied to, and taken advantage of by EA/Maxis. Yet I remain hopelessly optimistic that Maxis would fix these balance issues. I expected the server problems, but not the broken game within.

Till then, Tropico makes for a better city simulation; at least it doesn't lie as much as Simcity to me.

tl;dr: the very demographic that wants to play Simcity finds this Simcity to be shallow, dumb and broken. EA/Maxis to blame.

Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Half-Life, Fallout, Command &amp; Conquer, and SimCity are some of my favorites. I was excited to get the new installment of SimCity, I have been playing SimCity since SimCity 2000 was released in 1995 on Windows, I was 9 years old, and I have absolutely adored each version since then. I've dabbled in other titles in the ""Sim"" franchise over time. Who can forget the awkward yet fun gameplay of SimCopter? Or the quirky gameplay of SimTower? I've been happy to give Maxis my money (and my parent's money) for almost two decades now.



I bought the latest SimCity the day after its release, I wasn't able to actually play until 4 days later. I'm not going to list all of the problems with the game, they are well documented on this subreddit, and they are completely unacceptable. The last straw for me was seeing my cities simply disappear, without any way to get them back. Had they been saved to my computer, I would still have access to them. I tried so hard to enjoy this game, I didn't want to believe that it was awful, but it is, it really is, and I don't believe that there could possibly be enough updates to make it good. For the first time, I had to get my money back from Maxis.



I opened a chat via Origin, explained my situation, and stated that I would like to have a refund, as I was not able to actually use the game as it was designed. The origin chat rep said no refunds were available, he escalated my case after I pushed a little, and gave me a case number. I called in, waited on hold for 30 minutes and spoke to a ""Game Advisor."" I re-explained the situation, and was told that there would be no refund. 



Leaving me with no choice, I called American Express, and told them to perform an instant chargeback on the transaction, they did so, and the charge was removed from my bill immediately, **the call took 4 minutes**. Others on this subreddit have pointed out that my origin account will be banned for doing this, thats fine, because SimCity is the only game in my Origin account, as I said, I don't buy games often.



I am completely appalled at the behavior that EA has displayed toward their customers. We have been tossed aside as nothing more than statistics, and to be honest, it's saddening that it has come to this. Not saddening so much for those of us who have been enjoying video games for years, but more for those who are entering the world of video gaming now, this is their status quo. Abysmal customer support, outright lies, poor quality products, and invasive DRM, this is what a new gamer is greeted with today, and it's sad. We had a name for this type of DRM in the 90s and early 00s, it was called ""SpyWare"" back then.



The moral of the story is, vote with your dollars. Money is clearly the only thing that motivates companies like EA, so that's the only place we can hit them, and it's the only way that we can tell them this is not the direction that we want the video game industry to take.



EA will never see another penny from me, I gave them money for years, and the one time I tried to tell them that I was unhappy, they simply tossed me aside -- ""Nothing we can do."" That's fine EA, there may be nothing you can do, but there's certainly something that your customers can do, and I hope you start to feel it.



TL;DR: I was really looking forward to the new Command &amp; Conquer, now I will never play it.

I'm sorry Maxis, but this is unacceptable. Why would you release a game which cannot be played? Why would anyone spend 60 dollars on something which isn't even theirs for all intents and purposes? The game can be the greatest ever made, but if it's unplayable it doesn't mean a damn how good it is.

I was very excited for the release of the new SimCity, but you may have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory here. I will not be buying this game anytime soon and I'll be sure to tell my friends to do the same. Hopefully you'll learn from this fuck storm and either drop the always-online bullshit, or at least actually allow your fans to play the game they payed for. You guys want to stop piracy?

My closing thoughts on SimCity 2013,sab0tag3,369,65,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1c1ec9/is_that_all_there_is_my_closing_thoughts_on/,"Let me begin by saying that this is not a rant, a bashing, or anything of that nature. Although I did share the same frustrations over the bugs (which seem infinite now, every day I read this subreddit someone points out more I didn't know about. Thanks a lot /r/simcity.. I was enjoying my blissful ignorance lol) I thought I'd share my thoughts on the game and hear what else the community thinks. Over the last month I've logged about 220 hours of play time and despite the numerous bugs and glitches, I've enjoyed the game immensely. However now I'm growing increasingly bored with the game. It's come to the point where I feel as if I've accomplished all that I can. I feel as if I've 'beaten' the game so to speak, which is rather disappointing. I've played SimCity 4 since its release and to this day I find it entertaining. There's always something to do, and this keeps the game engaging. The massive regions and the millions of ways to customize your city (especially with modding) makes you feel as if your city is truly a unique metropolis.

SimCity 5 had a lot of features removed, especially the complexity and difficulty that made SC4 such an engaging experience. SC5 is a good game in its own right, but it just doesn't offer the same replay value as the previous version. So far I've completed all four great works projects, achieved success with all the city specializations, and experimented with cities of all different wealth and zone types. Now it feels as if my cities all end up being clones of one another and the only thing to tinker with is the road layout.

I think this feeling of unfulfillment comes from two things, the first being a lack of depth - in the sense that there doesn't seem to be any real challenge. The creators made the game much too easy; for example if you want to create a city with towering high wealth skyscrapers all that’s needed is an upgrade in road type and an increase in land value with parks. Or if you need money just plop a mine or oil well and watch the dough roll in effortlessly. It's arguable that specializations add some variety, but what good is that when the sense of challenge is lost? Once your city reaches the edges of the map the only thing to do really is sit back and watch the city climb upwards. Once that’s done, it's time to move on to the next plot and repeat the process. The second thing that creates this sense of unfulfillment is how the game really limits how creative we can be. In SC4, modding combined with massive regions meant you could literally have multiple plots that didn`t have any identical buildings and so on. I'm sure in the future there will be DLC content with larger city sizes, new building sets and specializations. And sure it will be fun for a while to try these out and make a few more cities. However ultimately the questions still remains:

And then what?

However to me the thing that is riling people up the most is blatant lying to placate/deceive/deflect.  Unfortunately for EA/Maxis there are a lot of very smart cookies in this community who shone beacons of truth at this bullshit.  For people new to this the biggest lies are:

* LIE 1) Offline mode cannot be enabled. 
This took less than a week to be proved false and was published as such in many distinguised media sources such as [BBC NEWS](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21802508)

* LIE 2) Quote from Maxis ""The bugs at launch are the result of the impossibility of testing every possible outcome.""
Anyone that builds a city for 3 or 4(takes longer as no Cheetah) hours or more will find numerous bugs/broken mechanics. In fact I would challenge the Maxis QA team to stream the build of a city for 3-4 hours without encountering gamebreaking bugs. It is just not possible.  Therefore they must have known about these game breaking problems and launched a broken product deceiving a million customers who assumed they had a working product, in the process.

* LIE 3) Quote from Maxis  ""Customers wanted an always online (MMO) experience""
I think every reasonable customer would like the opportunity to play multiplayer however very very few want it forced on them when it results in such a limited game play experience e.g. no load from a saved game or microscopic cities compared to previous versions'. Basically latest versions should not offer less functionality than their predecessor

* LIE 4 Everything is simulated. 
The clever cookies soon put pay to this lie by uncovering how vacuous the 'sims' are and that sim numbers after a certain point are inflated and not actually part of the simulation.

What other lies from EA/Maxis have I missed?

I have read numerous other articles from people complaining about this game and even some stating they like it, but I particularly enjoyed this one and I urge you to watch it:

But, honestly, I didn't stop playing because of the bugs and lost cities...I stopped playing because the game seems to be severely lacking in complexity. 

I've put about 20 hours into the game, but now that the veneer and novelty of the graphics have worn off, the actual gameplay seems to be mundane and empty. The only real creativity one can seemingly employ is with the design of roads. However, after your entire city is mapped out, it devolves into the repeated ""plopping"" of buildings. Plop this, plop that. And the rate of ""plopping"" decreases gradually as the game progresses. 

There just doesn't seem to be any management required. No challenges, no complexity, nothing to stop and make you think about how to best approach a problem or solve an issue. Unless there is a layer of depth I'm somehow missing out on...

Myself and my wife both agree the game isn't worth our time, no to mention the money.

I regret ever buying the game in the first place. Getting SC for my wife and I cost $125 total from Origin. The whole time I was thinking to myself, ""Just wait a few days, see the reviews. Don't pre-prder it, just wait and see"". I convinced myself to do it for the limited edition ""Only pre-order"" pack. Needless to say I was dissapointed that they used that as a marketing tool to trick you into buying the game early. They later extended it anyway. Hell, you can still get it on their site right now.

Anyway, I wouldn't have normally wanted a refund for a game, no less dispute the charge for a game, but this PR non-sense is intolerable. They are acting like the game is actually working perfectly even weeks after launch, and that's horse-shit. Even on simcity.com they are praising their 10/10 reviews. It's the dishonesty at this point that bothers me.

Anyway so the point of this, I called up Amex to dispute the charges. The rep knew about Simcity and about EA, and really didn't ask me much once I explained it was for SC. They said, ""Normally we do a dispute process, where we get in touch with the merchant, but for this merchant we just do a straight charge-back"". That was it.

So clearly EA has gotten so many charge-backs at this point due to this release, that they aren't even contesting them anymore. It costs more to dispute it than to auto-chargeback it, so they are just letting them all through immediately.

Anyway, it was fun /r/SimCity! I'm not concerned about my Origin accounts being banned, because I got Origin specifically for SC.

I don't see why downvoting and/or dissagreeing with someone who is enjoying the game is the right thing to do. People who are on /r/SimCity must know about the bugs and the broken game engine, let them enjoy it. Hell I enjoyed the game a lot too (until I noticed the broken things).

EA/Maxis hate is one thing, I understand it. But /r/SimCity has become very toxic and negative, besides the occasional SC4 post, most posts are about how broken SC5 is.

1363186751.0,256,self.SimCity,1a7uhp,Five Quick Fixes that would almost entirely solve traffic and simulation problems ,WeLoveKanjimari,315,59,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a7uhp/five_quick_fixes_that_would_almost_entirely_solve/,"1. Allow service vehicles free reign of the road, ignoring traffic lights and traffic itself. 

2. When a service vehicle is called somewhere, allow them to ""claim"" where they are going. If one bus is headed to one bus stop, do not *allow* other busses to be going there at that same time. If one fire truck is going to one fire, do not *allow* another to try to get there, too. 

3. While sims are at work, randomly decide which home each individual car will be heading to. While sims are at home, randomly decide which job their car will be heading to. No more forced gridlock from every single sim going the same route to the same buildings in the same order every fucking day.

4. Simulated population needs to be consistent. Right now, we've discovered that low and medium density population is multiplied. There may be 4 sims, but the population lists it as 16. That's **not a big deal.** It's not even ""misleading""- one sim simply represents 4.  SimCity 4 had populations that were literally meaningless as all sims were just little sprites on the buildings or little cars that disappeared and appeared at random. Here, we can see the sims and cars moving about, but if literally every single one was simulated, the game would be unplayable due to traffic. **The problem comes from high density populations**- they're not multiplied by the same factor as the others (one sim is equivalent to 16, IIRC), and it causes problems with every other aspect of simulation. (for example, double population =/= double tax profit, because you don't actually have double the taxpayers)

5. Modify the happiness system. Do not allow happiness to increase dramatically as long as a sim comes home with more money than they started with, as this leads to wild population growth and even **makes industry and shopping unnecessary** as sims can get shopping happiness from going to parks (which are treated as if sims are spending money, but they don't spend money, and thus have an excess every single day). Something here is just busted. Instead, happiness should focus on land value, proximity to services, education value, etc. No more ""High wealth as long as a statue garden is nearby"", high wealth homes should only appear if the things they demand **after** moving in are there **beforehand**. 

I played SimCity 4 for years. I don't know if it's just easier to understand what is going wrong in this version, or what, but I **never** got a skyscraper in SimCity 4. In this SimCity, population growth and happiness is so out of control that I got one the first day I played. Was it exciting? Hell yes. Did I feel accomplished? Of course! But it happened too fast. I should need 3 cities of crappy buildings before a fourth feels comfortable enough growing like that, and then the others can catch up.

[This image](http://imgur.com/z6Ovmkn) is ridiculous and speaks volumes.

I've logged in 108 hours of gameplay, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself at times, learning from the good people on /r/simcitystrategy about what I did wrong and how to master density, traffic and specializations. It's 3 AM now and I've been up to greet the roosters almost every night for the past week. Rest assured, I really applied myself.

I'm still against the hate bandwagon on this subreddit, and I tried my best not to bitch about the game too much, even earned a bunch of downvotes by trying to be constructive. And I continue to hope that Maxis will sort out this clusterfuck of a game.  I also truly believe I would not get 108 hours of anything worthwhile for 60 bucks, so I'm not saying I wasted my money. It's like watching a bad movie. I'm not sad I paid the admission price, but boy... that sure was a weird movie. 

It's like Prometheus all over again.

And like with Prometheus, I feel lied to and cheated with SimCity. I preordered this game on the merit of it's pre-release marketing and promises, not to mention the amazing legacy of the SimCity series. Although it's addictive and challenging on many subtle levels that I enjoyed uncovering, the simple truth is that more advanced gameplay simply isn't possible with the current traffic system. This image speaks for itself. 

I've done everything I possibly could to alleviate the traffic troubles on my casino island, and after fine tuning everything I could for the last FIVE HOURS most of the city is dense as fuck with the neighborhoods traffic free. The only bottleneck is the highway connection to my main avenue artery that simply cannot handle the tourists pouring into the city and is creating a bottleneck that stretches from my main casino all the way to the highway exits of neighboring cities! 

Four ferry docks, three train stations and a municipal airport that are spread around the city generate next to no traffic on the routes to the main city attractions, even though they're all utilized to the fullest -- further proving I did a good job on everything I could when it comes to other traffic sources. But this single point of entry from the highway stunts the growth of my city, as well as my patience with the game.

Game over, Maxis. Let me know when you get things right.

For visibility, here's an answer on why cheetah speed was disabled:

&gt;As most people have already guessed, cheetah speed has been temporarily disabled to reduce the amount of load on the servers. While the server team works to improve server performance, we are hopeful that this will allow more players to play the game in the interim. We fully intend to reenable cheetah speed once server stability improves.

1358624891.0,245,self.SimCity,16w1p6,My thoughts on SimCity so far,iomex,278,33,306,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/16w1p6/my_thoughts_on_simcity_so_far/,"I've done about 15 hours in the Dev Beta now and thought I'd share my feelings so far.

The game really is great - it does feel like a good quality product, despite some shortfalls it's overall excellent.

**TRANSPORT**
Laying roads feels very similar to CXL - except Maxis has done a better job. Being able to draw even curves, perfect circles - as well as dotted lines appearing on the ground to guide you all adds up to a good system. Being able to upgrade roads is a valuable tool, and GLR-in-avenue is very handy.

The traffic data view is a little more natural, in that you only see a snapshot of what's going on at that moment. In SC4, you saw day-long congestion data, in SC, you only see what's happening right now. So, if you want to see how your main avenue is doing at rush hour, you'll have to wait for rush hour.

Bus termini are an excellent touch, you are able to build large termini which also cater for intercity bus lines, so your sims can catch buses between cities. Your bus termini and depots can be upgraded, so you can add more garages to increase the size of your fleet.

Unfortunately, there are some shortfalls here. You cannot adjust road height as in CXL, which makes it difficult to iron out lumps and bumps in the roads. There's no one way streets, and no highways (that you can build, anyway). Also, I was disappointed to see that buses are used in the same way as SC4, in that you place bus stops and buses travel between them autonomously (with the exception you must now have bus depots/termini). Also, buses appear to be free to board (although I might be mistaken here).

**CIVIC AMENITIES**
Police stations, clinics, fire stations, etc are all implemented excellently. Basic stations can first be built, which gives you the building and a fleet of 1 or 2 vehicles. Additional facilities (such as patient wards or prison cells) can be added later using the excellent modules system.

The operation of these systems is equally excellent. Sick people will drive to the hospitals, and your ambulances will go and collect injured people. Of course, if your fleet isn't up to the job, those injured people can die waiting for an ambulance. Sims will stay in the hospital for some time then will be released. Policemen sims will patrol the streets, and actively pursue criminals who will be detained in the police station for a set time. What I particularly like here, is how sims are criminals - crime isn't committed randomly, people with criminal tendencies start with petty crime and will escalate to things like murder. With fire, crews respond by themselves when a fire starts. They respond in much the same way as before - but the whole package feels a lot more convincing this time round. I particularly like watching emergency vehicles negotiate city traffic, and how cars will go around parked ambulances/police cars/fire trucks.

Adding the relevant department to your city hall will give you more options for upgrades and buildings. (While we are on the subject, you can add departments to city hall to get further upgrades for relevant items - plop the Department of Transport to get access to train stations, for example).

There is little to say against the game in this respect really. It all works as you'd expect it to.

**UTILITIES**
This is one of my favourite parts of the game. All utilities are handled by roads - no laying pipes or power lines. Dealing with sewage is a new and interesting aspect to the game. I enjoyed listening to the gross sounds the sewage outlet pipe made when I first placed one.

Waste collection has been improved immeasurably in this new release. You place a city dump (which you can expand), and are given a few garbage trucks, which will make their way round the city collecting trash from each trash generating premises. If you open the data view, you will see the trash level at each property lower as a garbage truck visits. Once their rounds are complete, the trucks return to the dump to offload the garbage and await the next collection round. This system is absolutely excellent and very rewarding when you've got a well managed system.

Water and power work as very similar systems. You place a source at the best location (a windy hilltop for a wind power station, or a high part of the water table for a water tower, for example), and the power/water is distributed along the road network. Consumers are served on a first-come-first-served basis, so homes and businesses closest to the stations have the most reliable supply. When demand outstrips supply, those at the furthest reaches of the network are the first to lose their supply. The supply recedes along the road network, until capacity is increased. You can add further wind turbines to your wind plant, for example - or secure a supply from another city in the region (as you can also do with police, ambulances, fire service, garbage collection and other services).

Again, its very hard to fault this system - it works brilliantly. My only complaints here would be that the range of these systems are very poor. It might be an idea for substations to increase the range, for example.

**STABILITY**
Not so good here, but we are talking about beta software. Occasionally, I've had problems where on trying to load a city the game states there has been a problem, and I am returned to the main menu. When this happens, the game must be rebooted or the game will hang at the loading screen when trying to boot a different city.

I've had one crash to desktop error, too, which was a .NET problem.

There are still a number of graphical glitches throughout the game, most prevalant are missing road textures on some intersections, and how terrain can 'cover' roads when zoomed out.

**LOOK AND FEEL**
Feels a little strange at first, and I've only just started to get into the swing of it. Feels homely, though. Some reused sounds from SC4 as well as Simlish speak and Maxis humour reminds you that you are playing a SimCity franchise game.

Once you have become accustomed to the game, it hooks you in and is very playable - much like SC4. You can play by laying a grid pattern city, plopping down power/services as and when demanded, or you can play the game to its full potential and run a city to its full potential - so its accessible and engaging at the same time.

I particularly like how you can zoom into region view on the fly, to be able to setup neighbour deals, etc, and instantly zoom back into your current city.

However, a major problem here is city size. Whilst Maxis keep saying how cities are the equivalent of a medium SC4 city, it in no way feels like this at all. I'd certainly say that cities need to be at least double the size. I understood points made about restrictions on city sizes being dictated by computer performance benchmarks - but I don't buy this at all. I have been playing quite happily at 30fps on my low-spec system on low settings, and 15fps on high settings (in developed cities). I think it should be up to the player how large his city should be. For example - I avoid large cities in CXL due to performance issues.

This aside, the game runs beautifully. I run a low-spec system and the game runs upwards of 30fps (if you are prepared to sacrifice the gorgeous lighting effects). The game still runs to an acceptable level on a low spec system with decent settings if you don't mind sitting below 20fps. It looks beautiful - camera zoom effects when you move about are really nice, and the overall look is excellent. Being able to set a colour tone to match the city is a nice touch, too. I can't say too much about tilt shift as I've set it to minimum.

The music really ties it all together - you already know about this system but it really does feel better in the flesh.

**MULTIPLAYER**
I've not played about with this yet, but I can certainly say that as a single player game, this works absolutely fine. You can play by yourself in your own region - and if you hash a city or a region up, just abandon it and start afresh.

Just as long as there isn't a network issue - which could be a problem in the future. I hope that there is an API or something so people can host their own SimCity servers if/when EA can't be bothered to anymore.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,True,t3_16w1p6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/16w1p6/my_thoughts_on_simcity_so_far/,

1359654090.0,243,self.SimCity,17n11e,Simoleons to USD conversion,abcedarian,274,31,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/17n11e/simoleons_to_usd_conversion/,"In another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/17lhf7/witch_simcity_you_will_buy_limited_edition_or/)  in criticizing the OP's use of ""witch"" instead of ""which"", I wondered how Galleons, Knuts, and Sickles (that's Harry Potter wizarding money, for the uninitiated) converted to Simoleons.  Since no one replied, I decided to find out for myself. Of course, a lot of speculation, and shoddy work went into this, so, it's no guarantee. 

In the beta for the new SimCity, a police station costs 30,000 simoleons.

Using [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/I1iJazRh.jpg) as a guide, I measured the width of the police building and compared it to the width of the avenue which developer Ocean Quigley has stated is [48 meters](https://twitter.com/oceanquigley/status/296498338004598785).  
So, I came up with the width of the main building of 17 meters, or 55.77 feet.  To my eye, the building seems twice as deep as it is wide, so I assigned the depth to 111.54 feet.  This gives us the square footage of a single story as 6220.58.  I multiplied that by 4 (the last story is smaller, but I did not include the garage in my original width measurement, so I'm fudging a bit here) which gives us a total square footage of 24,882.
According to [this website](http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/rsmeans/models/police/) to build a police station with a brick facade (like we see in the screenshot) costs (using union labor) $181.97/sqft, which gives us a total cost on our building of about $4.5 million.  BUT the police station also comes with two, fully equipped squad cars which according to [this random guy](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101127110325AASA38k) would cost just shy for $100k, so let's round that up to $4.6 million.  That means that 1 Simoleon is approx. equal to **$153.33**.

I really like the new SimCity. Sure, the always-online DRM, sub-par traffic AI, small plot sizes, server issues, etc. are all pretty bad, but I don't really find them game breaking at all. Once I actually start playing, I have a lot of fun drawing my cities and seeing how they turn out. It might not be the deepest simulation ever, but it still makes for a fun couple of hours. If I were to rate the game objectively, I'd give it a 4 or 5 out of 10, but if I rate it based on how much I actually enjoyed it, it easily gets at least an 8/10.

I also don't really like all the hate directed toward Maxis and EA. Sure, a bit of it is justified, but it really is crossing the line.

unfortunately, reddit has a character limit on these posts so i've decided to host the list through an external site. if you're new to the modding community, i highly suggest checking out my list, it's a great starting point. if you already know what you're doing, check it out anyway and let me know what you think. i'm open to suggestions, if you think i may have missed something, let me know and i will add it to the list.

1364230551.0,240,self.SimCity,1azd1r,Thank you EA/Maxis for bringing a great city simulation back into my life: SimCity 4,Exivus,324,84,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1azd1r/thank_you_eamaxis_for_bringing_a_great_city/,"After reaching a complete dead end with SC5, I found myself insatiably longing for a true city simulation. So I read a few posts about SC4 and reinstalled it. 

Perhaps like others, I only played SC4 for about a year or two and then off and on after its initial release. But this time around it wasn't the SC4 of eight years ago - following my experience with SC5, it was new, vibrant, challenging, expansive, beautiful, creative and exciting. The kind of thing you'd leave on your second monitor to watch a little ecosystem grow while you work and at night, tinker with it and build a little more.

In those missing years I really did not know that a vibrant community sprang up and genuinely supported and grew SC4 into a masterpiece. I just never really bothered to check in on it. I didn't even know it was modifyable. 

Slowly it all came back to me - as if SC5 was the predecessor and SC4 was the new SimCity. Expansive city sizes, offline regional play and connectivity, ordinances (my how I missed them), highways and infrastructure were just the beginning.

Then I went out and installed NAM, some props and a few other key components that the community built and supported. The new SC4 on my screen didn't insult my intelligence - it actually left me challenging the extent of my imagination, with nearly endless possibilities in the sandbox game that I always grew up with and loved.

In short - thank you EA. I would have never taken the time to find SC4 if it weren't for SC5.

P.S. - a big thank you to all those people that supported and created a great platform in SC4. Everyone that enjoys it should donate to the websites and communities that continue its support.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,True,t3_1azd1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1azd1r/thank_you_eamaxis_for_bringing_a_great_city/,

The feeling of ""This City goes like clockwork because I am an awesome city planner!""",C_h_r_i_s,286,58,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ac9ap/the_real_issue_with_simcity_the_feeling_of/,"As a long time die hard SimCity fan something struck me last night.

I remember when I used to play the older SimCities. You started out with this huge sandbox. You had months and months ahead of you to build a huge metropolis. The vastness of it was mesmerizing. 

You got to plan ahead and make clever decisions on macro and micro level. If something didn't work as planned, you fixed it. When your city evolved you felt that it worked well because *you* planned it so. You felt *you* where responsible for the awesome creation.

I remember thinking ""I should be a city planner! I am really good at this!""

With the new SimCity I get a feeling of ""I can fill the entire city space in half an hour"". It's not a grand building project. And because of weird traffic/agent behavior you don't feel it is *your* accomplishment if the city works, or *your* responsibility if things go haywire.

In the old SimCities, if traffic was bad, you thought about how to tackle the problem, analyzed the traffic patterns, and made an adjustment. The feeling of seeing things clear up. THAT is what created the good experiences. In the new SimCity, you see a problem, you try to fix it. It may work, or it might send 20 fire trucks to the same fire while the rest of your city burns down. Either way, I don't feel responsible for the outcome of my development.

I guess the feeling I'm longing could be fixed if the agent logic was fixed, the game was better balanced, the city size was greatly increased and the fudging of sim count was fixed. But as of now, I didn't feel it. I returned the game, hoping to see some fixes down the road.

It really is a shame. The game has incredible graphics and the idea behind the ""real simulation"" is exactly what I wanted. It breaks my heart to realize I got bored of the game after 3 days of playing.

**TL;DR: The game feels random. I don't get any proudness when things work, or feel responsible when things don't. It doesn't feel like a grand building project, but a two hour exercise to maximize your city. Fixing the game logic, balancing the game and increasing the city size would help, but as of now, the game feels like a big beta. Returned the game yesterday, which breaks my heart.**",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1363335895.0,,,True,t3_1ac9ap,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ac9ap/the_real_issue_with_simcity_the_feeling_of/,

------------------------------------------
###Analysis###

For sheer value-for-money, **Dead Space 3** is a clear winner. It's been criticised for watering down the horror aspect and instead going for frights and action. Still, it's a polished game from a mature franchise. *Edit: [seriousbusines says](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1al86d/looking_for_advice_on_which_free_game_to_choose/c8yhffk) that the singleplayer campaign has a good co-op mode, so if you and a friend both bought SimCity, you may enjoy playing this as co-op*.

Skip **Bejeweled**, **Plants vs Zombies**, and **Medal of Honor Warfighter**. The former two are much better on mobile (and are better suited to that format); the latter is astoundingly mediocre.

**Battlefield 3** is a very pretty large-map large-team multiplayer shooter. It stands against Modern Warfare 3 and each side of this argument has its defenders and detractors, which I won't engage with here. One thing to note is that this is the Standard Edition, so it does not include the expansion pack or any unlockables (equipment, guns, etc). As such, you *will* be at a disadvantage starting multiplayer ~2 years after release. *Edit: [rmsrk says](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1al86d/looking_for_advice_on_which_free_game_to_choose/c8yhj8l) that the first weapons you get are just as powerful as unlockables, and there are servers that restrict players to starter weapons/gear only.* Still, it is pretty.

**Need for Speed** is a Need for Speed game. Do you feel the Need? The Need for Speed? You should play Need for Speed. If you don't feel the Need for Speed, then you have no Need for Need for Speed. *Edit: [rotj says](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1al86d/looking_for_advice_on_which_free_game_to_choose/c8yfy0o) that NFS: Most Wanted is more like Burnout Paradise, an open-world racing game with a focus on multiplayer.*

**Mass Effect 3** is the long-awaited conclusion to the massive, operatic science fiction series from Bioware (Baldur's Gate/Knights of the Old Republic/Dragon Age). The ending of this game was widely and thoroughly derided as lacking in emotional closure or thematic consistency with the rest of the series. Following widespread outrage and far-reaching negative press, EA and Bioware released an free Extended Cut ending DLC some months later that mollified most, but not all, players. The game itself is excellent and I was less put out by the ending than most, but it's best experienced as the conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy rather than as a stand alone game. This particular game and the Mass Effect trilogy is commonly on sale at retail and online. Note also that this Standard Edition does not include any DLC, which typically costs $5-10 per pack. ME3 also includes a 4 player co-op multiplayer mode where you defend against waves of enemies.

**SimCity 4 (Deluxe Edition)**. This is a strange inclusion, from a messaging point of view. Would you offer a free copy of Civ IV to people pissed off with how Civ V came out? It suggests that the previous game in the series is perfectly adequate at satisfying users' desire for ""Civilisation game"". 

In any case. Simcity 4 was released in 2003 - 10 years ago. In some respects, it has aged remarkably well. The UI remains serviceable instead of maddening, the mature (in some cases, aging) mod communities has fixed many of the issues that affected the game even following the desperately-needed transport-focused expansion, Rush Hour. The same communities have also created a multitude of new buildings, services, terrain doodads and other tweaks that mean that game remains playable (in widescreen!) a decade after release. Of course, SC4 is not without its issues. Cities take a comparatively long time to load and run relatively slowly, even on modern machines. Cooperative regions require fragile and ungainly hacks to get working. For most of its life, /r/simcity has been a SC4 subreddit. Take a look at the links in the sidebar, including the related subreddits, for more information.

------------------------------------------
###Conclusion###

Whatever your thoughts on the launch or quality of the new SimCity, if you've bought the game then you're entitled to a free game. If you don't own SC4, now's the perfect time to get it. Otherwise, consider picking up Dead Space 3 or Mass Effect 3.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1363738607.0,,,True,t3_1al86d,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1al86d/looking_for_advice_on_which_free_game_to_choose/,

The reason that the simulation is flawed, is the lack of proper time-scaling. This post is a bit nerdy, but stick with me!

###12mph speed limits - the maths

You can try this out for yourself in a sandbox city. We have been told repeatedly that the city plots are 2kmx2km - let's take this to be true. Draw a road immediately from your highway connection all the way to the other side, and time how long it takes that car to reach the other side of the map - it will be around 13 seconds in realtime. Each in-game minute is 2 real seconds, hence 13 seconds is 6.5 in-game minutes.

As speed = distance / time:
&gt;Speed = 2km / 6.5mins = 2km / 0.108hours = 18.5 kph = **11.5mph**


###Why does this matter?

Realism aside, it shows that the idea of representing every sim is a flawed mechanic, *unless* you are going to appropriately adjust either the length of an in-game hour or the speed of the traffic. Ironically, a representative traffic system such as SC4's, is actually a lot more realistic without these changes.

This will be a key challenge for devs in opening up larger city plots, as there is just no way you can avoid traffic snarls right now. The problem is also further complicated by the whole budgeting system being linked to the in-game clock. You can't simply adjust the length of an in-game hour without it having an impact on finances.

We all have complaints and I've sure got my own (often heard) complaints.

* City size.  It's too small
* The online requirement.  It does not need to be there.
* The server issues (you KNOW they will be fixed.  Except for their long term 10+ yr. support is still a tossup.)
* DLC will be added way before modding (if modding is ever added)
* The space between the cities looks ridiculous, and they could at least put some trees or fake houses there.   
* They should have not been dum-dums and expected the immense demand based on their preorders alone.  How they messed this up is beyond me.

Now, let me step off my soapbox and say a few things I couldn't find in the first 50 posts here.  When you are playing, it is fun.  It could be a hell of a lot more fun when cheetah speed is back, and we'd all like a little more space, but it does add a bit of challenge, and they've really focused on inter-region play.  This isn't that different from the way SC4 is set up, it's just being implemented differently.  Here's a few positives to even out the bad, just from my own personal experiences.

* The game is fun.  Okay, it may not suit your playstyle, but you can't make a game that everyone will like.
* EA has worked hard to bring more servers online.  Every day I play I see more progress.  I'm frustrated  it's not completley reliable, but they are making progress.
* They're giving you a free game from the EA library for toughing it out.  I know that's a bribe, but it's always nice to hear an apology accompanied with a bribe.  
*There can be the argument that the limited city size can add a degree of difficulty to the game.  

That's just my 2 simoleons.  I like the game.  Downvote away.

It would probably be a bit hard to follow parts of it without the audio and/or some programming knowledge so I'm writing this to try to help alleviate some of the emotional response to parts of the simulation seeming to be broken. I highly suggest you guys try to read through the slides though and maybe watch the [SimCity specific footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=15v46iYUCck) which explains how the parts of GlassBox work for a few scenarios in SimCity including going to work and coming home. Seeing that should make it clear to you guys that they intended this kind of simulation logic since early development.


Disclaimer: I could be wrong about some of this stuff and things may have changed. This is just my attempt as a fan who has a lot of enthusiasm for interesting design (beyond my boring-ass development job). I've learned a lot in the past couple days and just want to share that to hopefully help people understand.

**----------------- GlassBox basics -----------------**

* ***Resources*** - This can be anything you could represent as an integer number. Power, water, money, goods, and even the population themselves are all resources.


* ***Units*** - These are the ""things"" on the map. Each unit has a state (collection of resources) and a location (where it is on the map). For the most part units are going to be buildings, but in the slides Andrew says they could be people. This is NOT the same as an Agent. Different kinds of units have different kinds of resources associated with them.

Completely made up Example I'll be using later in the Agent's section: ""Smith's Residence"" is a Unit in some residential zone. It has a set of resources, say: 3 $$-wealth sims, 5 money, 12 happiness, 2 water, 0 trash, 4 electricity, 0 sickness.


* ***Maps*** - These represent the resources that are in the environment. So this is the ""oil"" under the ground, or ground pollution, or air pollution but also more ""abstract"" things like land value, crime, whatever. Basically anything you see in the data views thats displayed as gradient on your map (as opposed to the columns).

Units interact with Maps based on where they are. So a Coal Mine periodically will extract coal from the map under it, reducing the resource count associated with that map. A dirty factory will increase the resources of ground pollution in the ground pollution map, air pollution in the air pollution map, and fire hazard in that map. A water tower will extract water from the water table map (and I guess ground pollution, though I'm not sure if water towers actually do reduce the amount of ground pollution).

Another example shown in the video of a map is how they draw trees. I imagine there is a ""growth map"" and when you use the Nature Trees tool you're directly adding to the resource in the map where you click. This is why when you draw trees and then build a road over it, the trees don't show up while the road is there, but if you demolish the road the trees pop back up. The road's presence just stops the art for the tree from being drawn, but the resource is still in the map. I imagine trees can also be planted on top of industry buildings to reduce their ground pollution similarly (there is probably a looping rule that just reduces tree amount and ground pollution every x time across maps).


* ***Globals*** - This would be a pool of resources that is associated with the game instance (no defined location).

* ***Rules*** - These are the ""verbs"" of GlassBox. They are used to move resources, convert them, etc.

Examples from the slides:

    rule harvestWood
        Money in 10
        Wood out 2
    
        People in 1
        People out 1
    end

What this rule did was it converts money resource into wood resource IF a person resource was available. The whole rule happens only if every part can occur and you can set them up with some periodicity as well as repetition.

There are different kinds of rules, some for units (which can work on local resources (within the unit), global resources (to the whole gamespace), or map resources. They can also give game feedback.  Map rules might move resources around (spreading of pollution). Here is a more complicated rule:

    unitRule mustardFactory

        rate 10
        global Simoleans in 1

        local YellowMustard in 6
        local EmptyBottle in 1
        local BottleOfMustard out 1

        map Pollution out 5

        successEvent effect smokePuff
        successEvent audio chugAndSlurp

        onFail buyMoreMustard
    end

So this rule runs every 10 ticks, takes some money in from the global pool, uses up 6 YellowMustard and 1 EmptyBottle resource from within the mustard factory unit, adds 1 to the BottleOfMustard resource in the unit, puts 5 pollution on the map, and creates some visual effects/sounds. Finally, if something couldn't work (say you were out of YellowMustard in that unit), it runs another rule called ""buyMoreMustard"" which presumably would somehow get the factory more mustard.


* ***Box*** - The final main part of GlassBox - everything from the resources, units, maps, globals, and rules are in the box. This would be the collection of the game scripts as well as the game state (this is what is getting synched for cloud saving).


**----------------- WHY DID THEY BUILD IT LIKE THIS? -----------------**

This architecture gives the units the simulation logic, so you can add new novel logic by simply defining a new type of unit. It also allows them to theoretically design better through iteration (instead of spending a lot of effort creating a lot of code to script how things should interact this is much simpler and they can just try it out in the game; if they don't like it or find something they don't like then it's an easy tweak).  This is part of why the whole residential with no commercial/industry thing is sort of a non-issue. They could easily tweak the rule for the park to not cost money and bam problem solved. If they want a more elegant solution they can change something else. Or add a new resource for park happiness. Whatever.



**----------------- Agents -----------------**

Okay this is sort of a big topic to try to discuss, particularly since it's probably the biggest thing that people are ""armchair developering"" about (I say that completely non-ironically as I try to explain this. Sorry to Maxis devs if I'm butchering something but I'm getting sick of it and wanted to write this). I'll try to do my best to explain why things are the way they are (and why it's NOT (in my opinion) a bad design) but this is basically off some year old notes that I didn't get the opportunity to even hear the associated audio for.


* ***Agents*** - These simply carry resources from one unit to another. They are NOT units in themselves in that they DON'T have their own rules. Why don't they run rules? Well the architecture of the rules is such that they seem to be periodic events fired by some unit with chaining involved. There's many orders of magnitude more agents than there are units (compare # of sims to # of buildings) so I imagine that it's simply not possible memory-wise for agents to have their own rules.

Agents are created in the unit rules (similar to how you create a resource such as ""local money in 1"" you would do ""agent People out 2"" to make 2 people agents). They're also given a destination in that rule and the rule can give some 

rudimentary instructions on how the destination should work. Other units will have ""sinks"" that advertise that they are accepting a type of agent.

Agents are controlled by *Transport Handlers* which is responsible for taking the agent to the destination unit.

Basic code:

    unitRule goToWork
        options -sendTo Work -via Car -using Road
    
        local People in 2
        agent People out 2
    end

This rule subtracts 2 people resource from the unit that the rule is associated with (probably a house) and then creates two People agents that are linked to a transport handler that will seek out a ""Work"" sink using the Roads in a car (so obey collision/traffic rules).

This is why one of the maxis devs said it would be trivial to ""fix"" the services to ignore traffic because they could just define a new transport handler that used the roads but ignored collision. It just wouldn't look great and they felt it added to the gameplay. They might still do it later though!

***Example*** So to go back to my ""Smith's Residence"" example above. It might run the goToWork rule. When it creates the People agents they're given random names that end with ""Smith"" to give the illusion of some persistence. If the ""Smith's Residence"" unit had previously accumulated enough money to become a $$ house then the agents it will emit will be $$-People (or something like that) and they will seek the nearest $$-job according to pathing. Later on the workplaces will run some sort of goHome rule that will create $$-people agents (and others) who are looking for Homes. When one gets to the Smith residence it will add to the local people number (up to the capacity), delete the agent, and also add 1 money (that it brought home from work). When a $$-shopper-sim is created by the ""Smith's Residence"" it will decrease the local money number by however much it is taking to spend, go to a shop; then an agent from a shop might come back to the Smith's Residence, add to the local people and add happiness.

**----------------- Pathing -----------------**


They're using a D*-based algorithm with wavefront updates. I'm not that informed about these kinds of algorithms and the slides covering this part have no text associated with them so this is a bit hard to piece out for me but here's my best shot:

Each sink unit advertises a capacity (number of agents of whatever type that it can hold. This defines the sink's ""strength"". E.g. a factory looking for 12 more $$ sims has a higher strength for $$ agents than one that only has one $$  sim job left. Conversely if the former factory was almost full on $ sim jobs but the latter wasn't then the latter factory would be the stronger sink for the $ sim agents.

They also say they have a modifier for the length of the road which could be based on congestion or speed limit. My thought is maybe this modifier is too weak right now but hard to say.

Anyway, each time a wavefront update occurs, the system basically goes through every road intersection and calculates the distance from that vertex to the nearest sink. Agents will always move along the road towards an intersection with the lower calcuated number (how it calculated the ""shortest distance""). I suggest just looking at the slides for a visual, or check [**this IMGUR album I just made**](http://imgur.com/a/GEs2C); the slides walk through this process of some sims leaving a house (source) and at each vertex (intersection) there is a calculated ""distance to nearest sink"" that has been modified by capacity. So the sims keep moving towards lower and lower numbers. Once another house has been added as a new sink, the system recalculates distances; in the case in the slides there is a tie between two different directions... which way they go is presumably based on the traffic light then or random choice if there is no such traffic light (e.g. power resource). Once some sims have reached the destination house the capacity is decreased which lowers that house's sink strength and the vertexes are recalculated and agents will continue towards the lower number (in this case the agents that are already close to the house will continue on, but those that are back at the first intersection will go towards the second house that's still empty).  Finally they show that there is a different virtual distance field calculation for each type of agent with some other kind of agent on the same road system.

-------------------
**My Conclusions**

Anyway, this is relevant because all the suggestions [particularly here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a7uhp/five_quick_fixes_that_would_almost_entirely_solve/) that it's so easy to fix the pathing are based around the idea that the agents have their own rules. They don't! I don't know how hard it would be to contort the rule system into trying to make the agents ""claim"" a destination or have them do random destinations or whatever other idea people have. Honestly, once some things are tweaked I'm personally OKAY with the logic; it presents its own problems that have separate solutions ([making new side-streets that don't create a new shortest path but still let agents get to their destination without making U-turns? Neat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a5c4z/building_a_no_public_transit_400k_self_sufficient/))


I honestly don't think the simulation is broken. It's just not balanced perfectly and could use some additional rules and tweaks to help things along.  Yeah it isn't a perfect ""city simulator"" and I was depressed for a bit about that but I think that's maybe unrealistic and if we keep an open mind and give it some time to get fixed we'll be able to have fun in this system.

That's not to say that Maxis are faultless. While I'm sure the Maxis devs are working hard on trying to fix it; I imagine they just released when it wasn't quite ready and a lot of these problems would have been caught a lot faster with better beta testing/fixed a lot faster if they weren't working on making the servers not crash. The game just needed more tuning and I think it'll get there.

The biggest bright side of all this is that the system is really easily tweakable. I don't know how much Maxis intends to allow for users to create their own rules and mods (man, please do. I really want to play around in this engine and I barely even know how it works. So many ideas kicking around already) but if they let us we should be able to do incredible things with it. Expect entire new systems easily added via DLC at the least (please don't make this thread into a circle-jerk about DLC though... I really want to try to calm people down a bit rather than incite more anger).

Many of us subscribe to a mismatch of labels all at the same time: modder, offline advocate, et al and are highly devoted to our love of the game, so why the intolerance opinion?  Infinite diversity in infinite combinations, right?

I'm seeing a lot of comments down voted to oblivion, which have ample content, who are trying to be constructive, but don't follow the present narrative laced with angst.

If you take a moment and start reading some of the down voted commentary in some of the topics here on our sub reddit you will see a great many of them have been down voted to oblivion without taking this guideline from Redditquette into consideration :

**Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something,** and do so carefully and tactfully.

I have also found myself falling short in this area because I have failed to remember that after I edit I need to add an explanation. It usually takes me a long time to write a reply out and I repeatedly have to go back and better elucidate my point.

http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette

Here are some examples with people who have different opinions than the original posted, who wrote well thought out replies, as a courtesy. Many of the down votes they received seem instinctual and not given the same courtesy the the fellow redditor gave to the OP, regarding their disagreement.

Why this is a problem? It is stifling debate if you don't follow core tenets of agreeableness, the meta-narrative. We're also seeing more and more posts vilifying Maxis employees, yet we want them to show their face around here more? When people see this as going too far in their comments, they are down voted. *How far IS too far if our own community can't get a word in edge wise?*  People with valid points are being silenced for disagreeing with a particular slant on ""the facts"". Take a moment and go through top voted posts, scroll down, and take a good look for all the comments that were down voted. You'll begin to wonder why, too. It's the same way political correctness sometimes silences sound inquiry.

Here are some examples (by no means are they perfect examples, just ones that I plucked from today):

EA may have a PR machine that edits out all negative/contentious feedback, but that doesn't mean we have to follow suit in order to match them. Especially, when it ostracizes people who have different perspectives from having their say on the matter here, too. 

*I implore you to post examples of comments you found/read that didn't deserve the downvote status, so we can start giving credit to honest, constructive criticism, and bring awareness to this issue, even if we don't agree with their opinion.* **We should be moderating based on quality, not opinion.** (Reddiquette) A post that lacks in quality would be one that isn't follow the guidelines.

If this post helped you get your money back, just leave comment so I know.
-----------------------

*EDIT: It's funny how people get upset if you downvote someone for their opinion on here, but they will gladly downvote someone just trying to help people get their money back.*

So I have seen a lot of people post about how they have given up on the game. But most of them say nothing about them getting their money back. If you are unhappy with the game, get your money back. In the end, if you think EA has done a good enough job fixing the game, you can always buy it again. But right now EA is just trying to string people along for as long as possible, because the longer you wait, the less likely you will be to get your money back. Whether it's because you just gave up and don't care, or because they think the longer you have the game the less likely your credit card company will be to approve your dispute.

This isn't about getting your money back because you simply didn't like the game. It's about getting your money back because you were lied to through false advertisements, and given a defective game, full of bugs and half ass lazy programming. Some people can't even play the game because of errors, and EA refuses to give refunds even to those people. As far as I'm concerned, EA does not deserve a dime for this game after all the lies and carelessness that has come with this game. I could go on about how corrupt Always-Online DRM is, but sadly, for SimCity, that is not the problem here.

And just so people are aware, EA will **NOT** ban your Origin account. They will simply deactivate SimCity in your account. This was confirmed, by a Phone Support Manager I personally spoke to. You can also ask EA Support yourself, if you want to verify.

So here's what you do.

1. Seek out a refund from wherever you bought it from. Origin, Amazon, GMG, etc. Even though the chances Origin will give you a refund are like 1 in a billion, you need to do it. This step is very important. Make sure you take down the date, time, and name of person you spoke with. If this fails you will need most, if not all, of that information later.

2. If you didn't use PayPal, skip to step 3. If you did use PayPal, and the first step doesn't work, open a dispute. Make sure you make it clear that you tried to resolve the issue with the seller. Again, make sure to take down the date, time, and name of the person if possible. (I am not sure if PayPal gives you the name of the person that handles your case)

3. ***Make sure to read this entire step***  
If that doesn't work, then it's time to contact your credit card company and file a chargeback. Some companies allow you to do this online. Make sure you make it clear that you tried to resolve the issue with the seller. Most credit card companies are aware of SimCity by now, but make sure you make it clear that the game does not work as advertised, and is as defective as a game can be. If a long time has passed, you can also mention that you were waiting to see if the company would fix the game in a timely manner, and they didn't. At this point, there is not such thing as too much information/detail. You are pretty much building a case against EA to persuade your credit card company to get your money back.  
**Just to clarify, this is not always labeled or referred to as ""Chargeback"". It may be as simple as ""Dispute Transaction""**   
*Chargebacks can take some time to process. I am not sure if this is standard, but my credit card company gave me a temporary credit on my account instantly until my dispute was resolved.*   
**If you used PayPal, and you file a chargeback, it is going against PayPal. PayPal will deduct the money from your PayPal balance, even into the negatives. If it goes into the negatives, PayPal will lock your account until you rectify your balance, essentially giving them the money back, at least until you are at $0.00 balance.**

Hopefully by now you have your money back. Most people got their money back through a chargeback, myself included. If you were unfortunate to have your chargeback denied, there is one last step.

**READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**   
If possible, call and cancel your credit card. Obviously if have debt on it, you can't. Now the objective isn't to cancel your card. The objective is to be transferred to Customer Retention. Their job is to try and get you to stay. They will undoubtedly ask you why you wish to cancel. Tell them they denied your chargeback for a defective product, and don't want to do business with them if they can't get your $60 (Or however much it cost you) back. Make sure you tell them how much, because most companies would rather get you your $60 than lose you as a customer. If they don't then at that point it's up to you to decide whether or not you really want to stay with them. Personally, I wouldn't. But cancelling your credit card is not the point of this thread. I'm just trying to help you get your money back. So you decide.

So there you have it. All the advice I have on how to get your money back. Best of luck. And remember, you are the consumer. Companies need you. Not the other way around.

----------------------------------

There have been some good questions asked in this thread so I will include them along with my response here.

-----------------------

&gt;I am waiting for 2.0 first, at that point I will decide.

I am willing to bet that EA is dragging out this 2.0 patch as long as possible to help deter people from getting refunds/chargebacks.

From one gamer to another, I would advise you to act now. Like I said, if you feel that EA has fixed SimCity enough, you can always repurchase.

-----------------------

&gt;My banks a Federal Credit Union but the cards they issue out are Visa. Do I contact Visa about a Charge back after I talk to EA? Or do I contact my Federal Credit Union?

Your best bet is to contact whoever you received the credit card from.

-----------------------

&gt;I purchased the boxed copy from GMG with my debit card (bank account) and would like to know of any advice. You can't just do a chargeback.

First off, try getting a refund from GMG.

If that doesn't work, your bank should have a similar process for getting your money back. Call customer service, and ask them what you can do about a merchant who sold you a defective product and refuses to issue you a refund.

-----------------------

&gt;Tried the bank and they said they couldn't do anything, however I'm not 100% sure that is correct and so I am waiting until the end of this week for GMG to get back to me before phoning the bank again!

When you call them ask them that if they aren't willing to protect you from people who are essentially scamming them then why should you stay with them?

As long as you don't have a history of anything like that, they should be willing to make a one-time exception for you.

Customer care is rapidly diminishing these days because so many people are willing to take whatever they are told. If a company/bank/whatever is treating you like shit, take your business elsewhere.

-----------------------

&gt;I paid cash at a game stop, f*ck me right?

First off, when did you purchase it, and do you have the receipt?

You can try calling Gamestop and ask to speak to a manager. Ask him if they will issue you a refund for SimCity because [**Insert 1 of a billion possible reasons here**]. Although I don't advocate lying just to get your money, I do think the situation EA caused is unfair for a lot of people. You can tell them that the game gives you an error and you can't even play at all. If the manager tells you he won't give you a refund, you can tell him that that's the last time you do business with Gamestop since they clearly don't value you as a customer, and you will be writing a letter to Gamestop's Corporate Offices. Hopefully that will work.

1364172683.0,204,self.SimCity,1ay1bo,My battle for a refund with GreenManGaming and PayPal - GMG stacking reviews to sell more SC5 copies,AghaChris,260,56,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ay1bo/my_battle_for_a_refund_with_greenmangaming_and/,"I'm not sure if this community is aware of GreenManGaming, however, I would like to bring notice to what I consider to be their dubious business practices revolving around SimCity 5 (and possibly other titles). I purchased my digital copy of SimCity 5 through them on launch day. Excited to play, after booting up the game I was met with the same problems everyone else had. I was forced to play the tutorial 5 times and my regions were wiped out twice. Even worse, my friends regions showed as empty while on their side it showed they had saved regions. Frustrated, I wrote an honest review of the game on their website to warn other users that the game was broken. I then requested a refund from GreenManGaming. Surprised, I noticed the review didnt show up and thus I thought it just needed to pass a moderator queue.

I submitted a ticket to their refund department and shortly after I was told they would not be giving me a refund as per their TOS. I advised them that the game was significantly not as described insofar that you expect a product to work when it is sold, not be defective. They did not refund me thus I turned to paypal and filed a paypal dispute. At this point their SimCity 5 product page had 2 positive reviews, rating it 95%+, but mine still had not appeared yet.

The dispute was filed, I entered detailed notes about how the game didn't work, it was broken, and that it was a defective product. A few more days passed, no response from GreenManGaming, and so then I escalated the dispute for paypal to review. Another week passed, no response from GMG to respond to the dispute, and then finally they commented on the case (comments not visible to me). A week later, a paypal employee reviewed the dispute and filed in favour of the seller. I would not be getting my refund from paypal or GMG.

I then did some research to see what would happen if I filed a visa chargeback against Paypal and discovered that if I ever did a charge back from my visa to paypal, they would bar me from sending money until I paid back the amount I charged back through visa. Since I use my paypal to pay for other services (web hosting, etc) then this would not be a solution.

In one final plea, I sent another message to GMG and asked for it to be passed to someone senior. I asked for either store credit or a refund and advised that their business practice was poor and they were turning away future money I would spend buying products from them. I also advised that my review wasn't showing up and that it was suspicious that only positive reviews were being displayed for SimCity 5. I was told no refund would be issued once again and no comment was made about my review which seems to have disappeared.

Anyway, just a heads up, and a bit of a rant I guess. GMG may have good deals but the definitely don't have customer service at the top of their priority. Likewise, they do not provide honest reviews about games but rather sensor reviews which may hurt their sales. 

What frustrates me now is that I see paypal is issuing charge backs through their own dispute process for many other purchasers, however, for me they did not. *rage*",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,True,t3_1ay1bo,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ay1bo/my_battle_for_a_refund_with_greenmangaming_and/,

This is disappointing. I wanted to see how much cash I could accumulate and turn this into a minigame of supply chain management. The rest of the game isn't terribly challenging so my goal was to save enough money to rival the GDP of some smaller African nations. Instead I cap out at two billion and now there's nothing left to do. Why on earth did they put a ceiling at two billion (more precisely, a 32-bit signed integer, I suppose they could have used a 64-bit)? And what's the point of trying to salvage the gameplay by shooting for the trade leaderboards if you just stop making money at a certain point? 

I'm really trying to make the most of this game by trying different strategies or setting fun goals, but this is just another arbitrary limitation that kills the enjoyment. I realize that not a lot of people want or plan to save up that much money, but shouldn't I be able to play the game as I see fit, not bounded by seemingly random limitations?

The kicker: you can only gift a maximum of §10 million at a time. And you have to wait until it's been delivered to gift again.

**Traffic Pathing Algorithm**
&gt;Indeed :)
Ok, now take your road network, and imagine there are dozens and dozens of D* graphs getting built all the time, one graph per destination type.
Some of those are pedestrian destinations (like a house, workplace, shop, etc...) some are ""transit"" pedestrian destinations (like a bus stop that will lead you to a house, a street car stop that will lead you to a workplace, etc...). Those are used by the pedestrians and the stops to figure out who should go where.
Then there's a bunch of sets that are used by the transit vehicles themselves, like ""pick up shuttle passengers"", ""pick up train passengers at a neighbor's"", ""drop off streetcar passengers near a workplace"", ""drop off muni bus passengers near a home"", and finally, ""go from stop to stop"".
Whenever a transit vehicle makes a stop, it drops off all the passengers that can walk to their destination from it, then pick-up passengers. In most cases, if there is still room for passengers, the vehicle will try to go to stops that have people waiting. If it's full (or with a small chance if there's still room) then it will go straight to the first valid drop off point in a list, based on its passengers desired destination.
If it's empty, then there's a chance it will drive at random from stop to stop, until it picks up people.
Hope this helps figuring out how to play the transit game!

**Zoning**
&gt;If you use the guides, then you should get the right amount of space for back to back medium and high density buildings (they have the same depth). Sometimes it helps to be zoomed in when you draw your roads, as the guides tend to be followed more precisely than if you were zoomed out.
[[Source]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19sr2t/is_this_the_problem_with_traffic/c8rirot)

**Reset Traffic**
&gt;Also, when you load into a city, all the cars, pedestrians, trucks, buses, etc... start from the unit that originally emitted them again -- their location on the map isn't saved.
[[Source]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19sbn9/how_streetcarlight_rail_works/c8r332m)

**Mixed Zoning**
&gt;Do a search for Horizontal Mixed Use and Neighborhood Commercial, those are the two types of mixed use zoning the game supports.
[[Source]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19sr2t/is_this_the_problem_with_traffic/c8r2ycm)

**Work Requests**
&gt; I wrote the original code, but another scripter took over after I started working on the public transit piece. Work buildings send requests to residential buildings at 6am and 6pm (for night shift/continuous workplaces), but only for a portion of their workforce, say about 1/3. Neighbors will also call for workers at those times. This is so you get the rush hour effect. People will decide to walk or drive based on the distance between the workplace that requested them and where they live. If you build your city so you tend to mix zones, then you can effectively create a walkable city.
&gt; Then for a few more hours, the rest of the workforce will trickle in. You can speed up that process by building public transit.

&gt; OP is definitely on the right track in being disciplined and building his streetcar system as 1 line per depot, as opposed to a spaghetti dish.

**Bus System**
&gt;Keep buses on avenues and off smaller streets. Place bus stops on both sides of the road (so they're paired) to limit how many U-turns buses have to make.
[[Source]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19sbn9/how_streetcarlight_rail_works/c8r00jy)

&gt;You need to balance the number of buses you place with the number of stops as well as the complexity of your network. Not enough buses, and people wait a long time. Too many buses, and your streets get flooded by them.

&gt; Sims don't know which way the bus is going, they just know that if they go to this stop, then they'll be able to reach their eventual destination.

&gt;You should also put the pairs farther apart from each other, each stop can cover about 400 meters each direction.

1362784913.0,201,self.SimCity,19xwhx,Distribution of Client and Server Responsibilities Explained,DBrickShaw,231,30,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19xwhx/distribution_of_client_and_server/,"As we all know EA/Maxis has been very insistent that the centralized cloud server setup of SimCity is required to support the regional play, presumably because all cities must be simulated at all times for the interconnection of cities to work properly. This gives many people the idea that the EA/Maxis servers are doing a lot of work constantly simulating AI agents for all cities with the same level of detail that you see when playing the game, and that the centralized server is justified because our lowly desktop PCs don't have that kind of horsepower. However, based on my observations I strongly believe that this is not at all how the game works.

Here's my working theory for how the processing responsibilities are distributed between client and server:

**ALL** AI agent simulation is performed on the client side, and inactive cities **are not** simulated at the AI agent level. There's a few very good reasons why I believe this to be true:

* Speaking from a purely technical standpoint, it is simply not feasible to continually distribute the amount of data required to perform routing calculations for hundreds of thousands of individual agents in real time over the vast majority of internet connections available today. If any of the AI agent simulation was being done on the server side SimCity would use significantly more bandwidth than it does during gameplay, and gameplay would be significantly impacted when the connection was lost. As those who've fought through the last few days can attest, you can lose your connection to the EA/Maxis servers for hours at a time and the intra-city gameplay keeps working perfectly fine.

* Cities which are not being actively played show no signs whatsoever of intra-city development. Zoned land does not develop. The number of jobs, workers, and services provided by the city don't change. Industrial resources are not produced, and ore/coal/oil deposits are not exhausted. When you stop playing a city only a static snapshot of the city and the services it provides are saved to the server.

So how does inter-city regional play work? As far as I can figure, these static snapshots of other cities are distributed to active clients, and AI agents are generated from other cities on the client side based on aggregate statistics. Let's use commuting workers as an example. If workers are commuting from a nearby city to work in your city, there is no AI agent that actually travels from their home in the other city to their workplace in your city. What happens is that your client uses the static snapshot of the other city to determine how many workers are available and willing to commute to your city, and generates these AI agents on the highway leaving the other city. I would expect that your client also notifies the server of how many workers it's generated so that the snapshot can be updated for other active clients, but this is near impossible to test with the current delay on syncing between cities in a region. All passive services are handled similarly (i.e. water, power, sewage, etc.).

So what are the implications of this architecture?

* Industrial resource chains are fundamentally broken (especially for single-player): You've probably noticed by now that there's no way to have a city passively supply another city with industrial resources (i.e. they must be manually gifted by the player while actively playing the city), and this is a side effect of the above architecture. Unlike passive services generation of industrial resources depletes a finite resource in the generating city, and this requires that the intra-city simulation be run. This means that as soon as you stop actively playing an industrial city, it stops generating resources. Because of this the workflow for having a multiple city industrial chain is frustrating, at best. Let's say you have a city devoted to smelting alloy, and a city devoted to building processors. To make this work with a single player you'd need to play the industrial city until your freight depots are full, manually gift the resources to the processor city, then switch to the processor city to produce the processors, over and over. When you're playing the processor city no alloy is being produced, and when you're playing the alloy city no processors are being produced. If the city synchronization times were instant (which they should be once the server situation is resolved) this would be somewhat tolerable, but in the game's current state city synchronization can take hours, so this process just can't be done in a reasonable time-frame. Once the servers are resolved working concurrently with another player in real-time could result in a reasonable workflow, but people who prefer singleplayer are shit out of luck for the foreseeable future.

* Server demands related to simulation are significantly lower than you probably expect: With this setup, the processing of regional city interaction on the server side is just glorified periodic distribution of save games between clients. There's no heavy duty AI processing going on under the hood, and the bulk of the CPU use for the game is taking place on the clients. So what else do the servers handle that are bogging them down so ruthlessly? There's the leaderboards and achievements, but I think the bulk of what's bringing the game to its knees is probably the global market. Every 60 minutes of ingame time each of the trade depots/ports in your active city interact with the global market, and the calculation of global market prices seems like the only form of processing which spans between regions. This also explains why cheetah speed has been temporarily removed, as speeding up the ingame time also speeds up the rate at which your trade structures periodically make requests to the global market. **Edit**: The server also performs client action validation, as described in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19xx7d/trying_some_technical_analysis_of_the_server/). This is a huge source of load that I hadn't considered, and is more likely the reason cheetah was disabled (especially since the global market seems to be using fixed prices at the moment).

* With the exception of the global market, a centralized cloud server is in no way necessary for regional play: Since the regional play is really just glorified save state distribution between a maximum of 16 players there's no reason this couldn't be done using a traditional server architecture, and implementing regional play for singleplayer would be trivial in comparison to any multiplayer solution. For multiplayer, players and hosting companies could host dedicated servers (1 per region) that are responsible for storage and distribution of save states to active clients. This would bring the risk of losing your cities when your favourite server goes down, but backing up of regions to the local client could be easily implemented. It also opens the possibility of having multiplayer for modded games (i.e. pick a server with your favourite set of mods running, and you and yours friends can all play with mods together).

So why did EA/Maxis choose this network architecture?

* DRM and planned obsolescence: I think this plays a huge role in the decision, but it's been beaten to death so I'd rather not discuss it here.

* Elimination of user mods: This part of the system actually bothers me more than the DRM. Unlike previous SimCity games whose lifetimes were continually extended by user mods, the only extra content that will ever appear for this game will be whatever DLC EA/Maxis chooses to sell us. This looks good in the financial statements at first, but it significantly cripples the longevity of the game. It's also particularly frustrating that the game itself is structured such that it could fairly easily be made to support user mods in multiplayer (and likely already does have this code in place to handle DLC), but this will never be a possibility.

Thoughts? I'm very interesting in any observations you've made which would help prove or refute my theory of the network architecture. Has anyone noticed if workers stop commuting to your city when you lose your connection to the server? That data would really help determine how exactly the worker/service sharing is actually implemented. Also, has anyone tested what happens if two people spectate a city at once? Do both players see AI agents in the same places?

1345119569.0,193,self.SimCity,ybex6,[UPDATE] I have been playing SimCity 5 yesterday for over an hour. Here are the answers to the community's questions! (part 1),dudelsac,214,21,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/ybex6/update_i_have_been_playing_simcity_5_yesterday/,"Hi guys,

sorry to keep you waiting, it's quite busy here at gamescom :) Also sorry for not providing any pictures, but taking photos was forbidden at the booth and I wanted to respect the wish of Maxis. Besides, I was afraid they'd kick me out :D

I have been playing SimCity 5 at the Maxis booth, where they have set up a 20 minute demo of the game that ended with a meteor crash. The demo had a large watermark in it that made clear that this is ""Pre-Alpha Software"". I have been playing the demo four times: First, I did the tutorial that they set up, which led you through some easy steps: protesters in front of the city hall. They were demanding that I connect the city to the adjacent highway. Afterwards, other speech bubbles were popping up around town: Build a power plant, build water towers, build a school etc. This was a good introduction into the game, but for me as a experienced SC player, it felt a little shallow. To be honest, my first impression while playing the game was very different from playing SC4 and I was a little bit let down by the first playthrough.

But this initial bummer was gone when I started my other runs: The other times, I skipped the tutorial and went straight to the action. But what is this??? No rails? No Bus? No highways? I was shocked!!! 

But I was just being dumb: They have a new interface at the bottom, which had subcategories that I first didn't see. The interface looks great and is intuitive with a special twist: Once you click on roads for example, not only are you in the build menu, but you also have access to corresponding data layers - in this case the traffic layer, the pollution layer and so on. And let me tell you this before diving into your questions: The game is not as deep as SimCity 4, at least from what I could gather - But this lack of depth was made up for when you realize that the simulation is really great. The data layers are just awesome and I wish I would have a picture to show you their glory. There were data layers for almost everything: Happiness, Income, pollution, sewage, water, efficiency (radius) of civic buildings and many, many more. I can imagine that the old-school players among you might not be happy with their first impression of the game since the look and feel is quite different from SC4. At least it was like that for me. But once I found the data layers, I was really, really enthusiastic.

Anyway, **the tl;dr of my playthrough** is this: I was a little bit let-down at first since the game looks and feels different from SC4. But after some time with the game, I was rather enthusiastic and would have kept on playing and playing if Maxis had let me :)

&gt; **an honest commentary on the ratio of plop to plot. also whether choosing a city type is an explicit choice.**

It was just like in the previous SimCitys: All zones (R, C &amp; I) were plotted, Civic buildings were plopped. The building editor also plopped when you built enhancements there, like extra garages for the police station. So don't worry about too much plopping, it will be like in SC4. And it was possible (though a little fiddly) to bulldoze everything, so you shouldn't be commited to an explicit choice.

&gt; **What is the ""single-player"" experience like? For the conservative players (read old-school) amongst us - how does it translate in comparison to previous editions?**

The demo was set up on some kind of server (they had to reboot it after some play sessions), but it was essentially a totally singleplayer experience. I was never bugged with anything ""social"" or ""connective"". I felt like in my own little town, though I cannot say anything about the final game in that matter. Possibly, the SimCity World will be more prominent in the final game, but in the demo, I was totally in my own little space. 

As for the comparison, it is hard to tell. At first it felt strange, but once I found the data layers and the beauty of the simulation, it really felt like a true SimCity. It was defnitily less realistic and not as micro-managy as SC4 was, but it was very deep when you looked for the details. And it was defnititely not comparable to SC: Societies, since that felt like a totally different game. Not so for SC5. Some may think it is too cartoony, with all the speech bubbles popping up, but those little details made me feel much more connected to my sims. In SC4, you were like a detached god looking over the city, in SC5 I felt more like I was a part of it. I really liked that, but I can imagine that it is not for everyone.

&gt; **I would love to know how the services (medical, education, police etc.) zones are set up. In SC4, You plopped a school down and it had a radius around it that showed who it serviced. Has that changed? I think it would be great if you could create a customizable service area for schools and hospitals (think staff zones in Roller Coaster Tycoon)!**

It was kind of like in Cities XL: The reach is calculated by the amount of time the emergency vehicles take to reach their destination. So essentially, the more intersections you have, the shorter the reach of the building was. The width of the roads did not have an influence on the range, I tested that extensively. Funny sidenote: The police station had a radius of its own, but the patroling cars also spreaded the reach. The data layer became green in realtime where the cars were driving. The more police cars I added to my station, the more green area was ""driving around"". It was really neat to watch.

&gt; **I would like to see how much of that greenspace you can get rid of. Try to get buildings close to the street, I would love to see if you can pack a lot of urban design into this, vice everything having it's own 10m bubble around it of sidewalk and lawn.**

Just like in SC4, the size of the lots was determined by the AI, trying to fill everything as good as possible. You build roads and the system puts lots of different sizes along the roads. Some lots had more green area, some had less. So I guess that once you know how to ""trick"" the system, you can get rid of most of the green areas. Also, larger buildings had less green, just like you would expect it.

&gt; **Also, I want to see if you can build a community on a hill. suburbs winding up mountain sides would be good.**

We had only one city in the demo, which was rather flat. But the way I see it, building on slopes should not be a problem, the road building system looked pretty adaptive.

&gt; **finally, with the editor, play with that, do you find it to be like lego, or can you actually put together some pretty complicated stuff. Something prokissmo or somy would do, is it possible?**

I tried it on the garbage plant and the police station. At the garbage dump, you could lay out dirt roads alongside which you could put extra dumps. Also, you could add extra garbage trucks and an incinerator, editing all that was horizontally, not vertically. Not so for the police station: I build a cell block on top of the building and another cell block on top of that cell block. I wanted to stack another on top, but the game wouldn't let me. I didn't have time to test the editor more than that but it looked very flexible. I could have built the cell block on the ground beside the building too for example. It really looks like a fun addition and it should also satisfy the craving for more micro-management.

&gt; **Can you build narrow roads, buildings close by, alleyways to hide car traffic. Think of any major walkable cities downtown core (except most american cities, they are pretty spaced outl)**

This is tricky, but should be possible. If you build the roads in the right shape, the buildings are standing very close to the street and have not much green space. The only quirk is that the size of buildings is coupled to the road width. So you would need avenues there to get an american Skyscraper ""canyon"", which would space out things a little bit more. But it should definitely be possible with some clever layouts.

&gt; **Tell me if we, the simcity 4 enthusiasts, will enjoy it.**

This is a tough one. From what I've seen, the game is less of a transit simulator and concentrates more on the relationship between you and your sims. Maybe this was only my impression because in the demo, all other transit options besides roads were greyed out. I cannot say anything to this question as a final answer, because I only saw a limited demo but I will tell you this: I liked what I saw. It was definitely different, but it felt like a true SimCity after getting used to all the new stuff. I would have needed much more time with the game to really give an answer that would be fair to the game and to you.

&gt; **Stick it on a USB and share it with us ;)**

I still cannot believe that they gave it to me, but they said that they really like the way that I'm doing this questionaire for the community. So, behold, [THE DEMO OF SIMCITY 5 FROM GAMESCOM!!!](https://maoctopus.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/download-bear.jpg)

&gt; **can you please find out about agriculture and farming? I have seen no farm kind of things yet and I'm curious if they are going to include it at all, or it iti will be a ""stepping"" stone like it was designed to be in SC4 to get to small cities.**

In the demo, there was no farming and agriculture. Other items in the interface were also ""still under construction"", meaning they were blocked for the demo. But acriculture was not even in there as a placeholder, so my guess would be that it isn't in the game. But don't count on it, they could still be adding that afterwards.

I really just wanted to shout out /u/maxisMC for sticking with us.  Its clear that the game release wasn't what people wanted and being an individual who on their own couldn't control the overall company MaxisMC has stuck with us and born the brunt of our hate on this sub CONSISTENTLY through the launch.


I try to imagine what it would be like to be /u/maxismc or another person within the SimCity team right now.  Its very likely that I'd be lower ranking in the org and was working on the project because I loved the franchise.  I would be a couple of years into working on my project and was super into all the exciting pieces of what I had done.  Then... Shit...  The game was balled up.  Someone up the chain fucked up...  Technical glitches and PR gaffes as well as a general, constant unhappiness with my team's work.  


So what do I do?  I fucking dig in an bust my balls.  I was supposed to get to celebrate with the community and have fun but instead I make myself the connection that people have; I'm trying to bear the brunt of anger so that the community can at least feel a little bit like they're being cared for.  I'm probably under-qualified to fix the problems and can't do much more than mostly pass real information along, all the while taking large amounts of personal attacks and overt hatred for the thing I've worked so hard on.


I'm not making excuses for the game and I'm not saying anyone has been perfect along the way.

I admit that I bought it more because ""it's sim fucking city"", not because of an informed decision about a product. And now I feel duped, and it makes me angry at the publisher, and a bit ashamed for having been so naive.

The only solution to piracy is to make it an unattractive option. The ignorant traditional solution has been to punish paying customers by limiting usage, tracking information, requiring logins, and putting further restrictions on the PAID product (see the irony). Pirates remain unaffected, and this cause-and-effect is pathetic. I use pirated versions of several apps *that I purchased*, because the pirated version doesn't need USB dongles or online connections.

Even a fully cloud-based solution misses the point. This limits the user experience so much that users will be compelled to find another solution. For example the new Office licensing scheme simply makes users want to look elsewhere. The open source community kicks in here.

As a long-time software developer, I have a feeling I know what SimCity's developers are going through right now. They don't feel good about this either (and ohh man I would LOVE to read the post-mortem report about this scenario), in fact they're sick thinking that they just made something they're proud of, something that's could be the greatest yet, but is infected to the point where the reception will be bitter-sweet.

I had expectations for SimCity based on the previous versions. SimCity has always been my most ""introverted"" game. It's a decidedly single-player game, a game without a real goal, it's a bit like virtual legos. With every SimCity version, I wanted just a little something else. Curvy roads, less grid...

SimCity 5 was advertised as ""your"" SimCity. Finally a SimCity that actually is a real simulation. Deals equally well with grid cities or curvy cities. And finally a SimCity that's ""built to be modded"". From the videos I saw, it looked technically amazing. I was ready to give my money for this.

And for that the developers must be proud. But they must hate the fact that this exciting potential is ruined by a shaky foundation: this online DRM garbage. If there was an offline single player mode, I do think it would be the SimCity that I hoped for.

I even knew that the game would require an Internet connection, but I never truly believed that it would be so restricted as it really is. The implications of always-online are massive, and I underestimated this:

1. Your city names cannot contain foul language. Not a big deal, but this makes it feel different, too public. The feeling of an introverted lego game is lost.
2. The obvious connection issues... Online queueing for a single player game with no substantive reason to be connected is just horrible.
3. I cannot play in introverted moments like on transportation, or when my laptop is too far away from my wifi, or when my internet is down, etc.
4. If I must switch servers, I cannot play my cities. And then all my *new* work will be on a different server.
5. Potential to lose my progress entirely, as many have already experienced.
6. I cannot save my favorite cities locally or send them to a friend.

My point is that online DRM is not merely a DRM, it changes how the game feels and behaves. This feels like SimCity, suffocating inside a coffin.

As it is, I don't like playing SimCity. By seeing the launch screen, even if I can connect and play, it just makes me feel like I wasted my money and I'm wasting my time. Most of the details of SimCity are exactly what I wanted, but the online DRM transforms the entire thing into some game I would never have bought in the first place. I never thought I would ever feel duped by a SimCity game.

I wish I could complain about the small city size, but my critique stops at the online DRM.


**tl;dr:**

1. I have been duped based on expectations from previous SimCity versions.
2. Online DRM is not just a licensing module, it changes the entire feel and purpose of the game. SimCity is no longer my introverted virtual lego game.
3. I ""like"" this game like I like a steak covered in sewage. In theory yes. But I won't be digging in any time soon.

Follow the instructions and when asked to, go take some screenshots of the SimCity GB site: http://www.simcity.com/en_GB

Under their game info tab, there are a number of mis-represented features that need to be brought to the attention of ASA, who can at the very least force EA to not mis-represent the game. 

You are looking for information such as:

The site detailing leaderboards: Leaderboards have been disabled
The site detailing global markets: Global Markets have been disabled
The site detailing the construction of a Fusion Reactor as a great work: No such work exists
The site detailing industrial influence: Pollution is the only region wide influence. 

When asked to describe your issues with the advert, do so politely but extensively. Screenshots should only be of actual missing features By all means mention the bugs in SimCity (the game is therefore not performing as advertised) but that should not be your primary complaint. Nor should the MMO stance of EA. I threw it in but didnt find it on the site so just mentioned that it misrepresents the game. 

What you can mention is EA refused digital copy refunds in the UK, despite consumer protection laws allowing any UK resident to return a defective item bought on-line for a full refund within 28 days of purchase. 

I stress again, this is not EA bashing. Keep it clean and simple. What we are trying to achieve is for EA to correctly display their product in its current form. Which, as it is broken to all hell, will mean noone will buy it. If they refuse to do it, they will be bared from selling in the UK. 

The worse case outcome of this is the ASA deem EA's adverts to be representative. But they still have to talk to EA about every single complaint. So the message gets through anyway.

(includes a major rant),DJQuadRocks,256,75,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ccnkj/why_is_simcity_still_so_damn_broken_includes_a/,"I've been ATTEMPTING to play solo regions and it seems like things are getting much worse instead of better.

- Sharing services between cities suddenly stops for no reason whatsoever. It most often happens with water closely behind all the others.

- City Hall upgrades aren't being recognized to the other cities.

- Traffic paths are still broken beyond belief. Alexander from Maxis's blog post did 0 help. After about 90 minutes in a new city that was entirely based on his suggestions, all it resulted in was constant traffic jams.

- Things they didn't include like subways, one-way streets, high-speed rails, etc were all changed to street cars? They are a horrible replacement.

- There were some very fun things in older versions like agriculture that are gone now. Not only is it not realistic, I believe Maxis should have included that aspect. Why they don't realize games like Farmville have about 2 million people *each day* playing aren't included makes no sense.

- Casinos are still obviously broken.

- The city sizes are still way too small, but that's nothing new. If Maxis is still insisting on they want SimCity to run on every old computer in existence your grandfather owns, why don't they offer various region and/or city sizes which suits any configuration?

- Gifting is still bugged. If it rarely even happens, it takes about an hour for it to work.

- ONE entrance to almost every city? Yeah that's realistic. Which major cities in the world only have 1 single road connection to enter and exit them?

- After about an hour of playing on 4 different and new regions, the game decided to roll my cities back. I've seen complaints about that but it seems to happen on a regular basis now.

- Dr Vu and Maxis Man, please stop bugging me every 10 minutes.

Believe me I could go on. The beta test was obviously a joke and should have involved a lot more people. I cannot believe EA and Maxis didn't know the servers would have been overloaded based on the pre-sales alone. Servers should have been set aside to handle the load and deployed in minutes, not weeks. They based the server load by reaction instead of proactively. I own a server/hosting company and even a small business like my company knows in order to handle a potential server load, you need to have servers in place just in case the current ones can't handle the traffic.

Despite all this, I normally don't complain about games and services like this. I believe EA certainly shouldn't be the worst company in America. I attribute that to the bandwagon hate that gamers have when they can't play a game exactly when they want. Most YouTubers and bloggers think it's cool to criticize instead of actually being positive about something in their miserable lives. Most have no experience with the other ""nominations"" like Bank of America, Ticketmaster, AT&amp;T, etc. Really gamers?? It only shows you have 0 experience with real-life, and that's pretty sad. Telling for sure.

Ironically the same ""gamers"" that hate EA will be buying, and in fact, have pre-ordered Battlefield 4. How hypocritical is that? What a great way to support a company you ""hate"". Idiots.

i calmed down at work, i needed to vent about this ""game"" and felt i should wait until tonight and maybe i will be able to play. i was wrong, i played for maybe 10 minutes.

It's sad.  So much potential.  But after just, what, not 2 months of playing it, I'm really getting bored with this game.  And that's not because it's not a gorgeous game with a (potentially great) fun factor.  It's because the tiny city size is so limiting (my biggest complaint), the bugs are so bad, the ""multiplayer"" aspect doesnt feel like that at all, etc etc ...

Every one of my cities just seems to get to the point of being boring due to no further room to expand, all resources used up, just nothing left to do and no room to do it anyway.  And the whole concept of it being an MMO --even if you believe EA/Maxis was sincere about that and not just for DRM's sake-- is a huge fail b/c from what I can tell the most players you EVER really interact with are 3 or 4 at most... even if you're in a large region like Titan Gorge, you're not really connected to 15 other players b/c no city has road or rail connections to more than 3 or 4 neighboring cities.  Also how about some city shape other than perfect squares?  Looks dumb.  This wasnt an issue in SC4 b/c the plots were big enough that you probably didnt need to always build right to the edge anyway. 

Also as for the whole supposed ""MMO"" concept... if you mouse over icons of other cities/players it's not uncommon to see ""last time played 2 weeks ago"" or something like that.  That's multiplayer?  Building a city next to another one that someone set up but hasnt played in weeks?  When you play a real MMO like WoW there are always people there you're interacting with.  I think a lot of people start cities on here, abandon them or just stop playing, but they never go in and ""officially"" abandon it.  This game isn't an MMO.  Just a collection of random cities that no one is actively playing half the time.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,True,t3_1dcc33,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1dcc33/this_game_has_officially_become_boring_after_2/,

1364023477.0,174,self.SimCity,1aulc3,Non-Gamer Wife spend an aggravating hour with SimCity,decker12,240,66,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1aulc3/nongamer_wife_spend_an_aggravating_hour_with/,"My wife looked over my shoulder as I played a few hours of SimCity. She’s not anywhere near a hardcore gamer, but could appreciate a good game. She’s seen me play hours of SimCity 4 and while never actually playing it, she could appreciate the R/C/I aspects and budget managements of running a city simulator.

Anyway, last night I asked her to give SC5 a shot to get a non-gamer opinion. I poured her a tall glass of wine and let her run through the tutorials. 30 minutes later and she started up a city in my private region (har har) that had my only other SC5 city, a 5000 population plot of land which I built up over about 2 hours when I first got the game. I left her in the den and in the living room, I caught up on an episode of The Walking Dead.

She called me back into the den about an hour later, perplexed and annoyed. I did a quick glance over what she created. She had about 500 Sims, a coal plant, and a few blocks of reasonably spaced out residential, commercial, and industrial sites. Water, sewage, and garbage were in place and workin fine. She even dropped a clinic and a fire station. Everything looked normal – no high density buildings, no wacky road layouts, no traffic issues. Just a standard starter city, the kind you make after an hour without any major foresight as to any of the problems we’ve all come to know about this game.

Then I saw the rubble and heard the sirens. Two of her buildings, right near the fire station, were burnt down. Another was on fire. The fire truck was stuck in a loop. It would drive to the end of the street, turn around in the middle of the road, and drive to the other end, continually, while the building in another block burned. There was no traffic, there were no wacky elevation changes or curves or intersections, there were no strange dirt roads adding phantom turn arounds or anything. It was simply a fire truck U-turning for no reason, no where near the fire and no where near the logical pathway towards the fire.

That building burnt down and another caught fire. The fire spread while the single fire truck endlessly went in a U-turn type of circle, never stopping to put out the flames.

“What happened?” I asked her.

“I don’t know. A fire started and I saw my truck leave the fire station and it’s been going in this circle ever since. It won’t go to where the burning building is. It just does this.”

We watched for a few more minutes as more buildings caught fire. I briefly considered grabbing to mouse to intervene and ""trick"" the game by demolishing roads or quickly adding another fire truck to her existing station, but then realized I would probably just delay the inevitable.

My wife was annoyed. She spent an hour enjoying herself with the game, built up a decent starter city, and in my opinion did nothing wrong with her layout. We simply couldn’t get the fire truck to ever put out the fire, and 10 buildings ended up burning down, which at this starter city level, was a good chunk of her city.

That was it for her, she was done with the game. She felt cheated and felt like she literally wasted an hour of her evening. I was pissed as well, as after an hour of her playing, I had a promising vision of buying another copy, and then an evening building cities side by side with my non-gamer wife.

After quitting, she then she said “Sorry to waste a city in your region, I’m not going to play it anymore so just delete it and start again at that place.” I had to tell her that it was impossible for me to delete her city without deleting the whole region, which included “my” city from earlier in the week. 

Her words, not mine: “That’s really fucking stupid of them to have the game that way.”

**TL;DR: My non-gamer wife played SC5 and had an hour’s worth of fun building a decent little 500 population city. Ridiculous path finding AI resulted in a burnt down city and a wife who will never play this game again.** 

**She also cannot find any logical reason why I couldn’t simply delete a city that will never be played again.**

1363461897.0,175,self.SimCity,1af8jw,Guide – How to Get Rid of Germs,simcitymastery,207,32,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1af8jw/guide_how_to_get_rid_of_germs/,"Germs, germs, germs! Your city is amazing, you have a hospital and two clinics, and people still complaining about Germs. In this short guide I'll try to teach you how to get rid of those little bastards!

*(I apologize for any English mistakes you may find in the text. English is not my native language, so I'll probably make some mistakes.)*


**How to get rid of germs?**

Germs are a problem because they cause sickness. Sick Sims don’t go to work and don’t shop, resulting in sadness, which is bad for your city. Germs are caused by pollution, so **in order to get rid of germs you need to get rid of pollution**. 

These are the kinds of pollution that cause germs: **air pollution**, **ground pollution**, **garbage**, **sewage**, and **water pollution**. If you manage to combat all those kinds of pollution, you will be able to minimize germs in your town. Keep in mind that sometimes it will be impossible to have zero germs, so the best thing you can do is minimize the germs and have a hospital treating sick Sims.

**How to get rid of pollution?**

**Air pollution**

Air pollution comes from industries and other builds such as coal and oil power plants. That doesn't mean you can’t have these kind of building in your city, however you have to make sure the wind is not blowing the polluted air into your residential and commercial areas. The best thing to do is to check the wind direction before starting to build your city and plan your industrial/residential/commercial areas in a way to avoid the air pollution being blown into your residential/commercial areas. 

Another way to combat air pollution is planting trees (the option *Plant Forest* in *Parks* &gt; *Nature*). Trees remove pollution and die if they're in a heavily polluted environment. When they die you have to replant them.

**Ground pollution**

Ground pollution comes from **garbage** and **sewage**.

**Dealing with garbage:** Sims create garbage and garbage becomes ground pollution if not collected. To deal with garbage, you need a Garbage Dump, which will collect and burn garbage (To burn garbage you need Incinerators at your Garbage Dump. Incinerators generate air pollution tough) and a Recycling Center, which will cause Sims to separate recycling from garbage. The Recycling Center will reduce pollution, because you’ll have less garbage in the city, and will produce resources (alloy, metal, and plastic), which can be sold through a Trade Depot. Keep in mind the even with a Recycling Center you still need a Garbage Dump to collected the regular garbage.

**Dealing with sewage:** Sims produce sewage and sewage becomes ground pollution. The Sewage Outflow Pipes collect sewage and converts it into group pollution, which is bad! The Sewage Treatment Plant on the other hand collects and treats sewage, so you don’t get ground pollution. However, not always it's possible to build a Sewage Treatment Plant in the beginning (in order to build it you need a City Hall and a Department of Utilities **in the region**). If you don't have access to the Sewage Treatment Plant, use Sewage Outflow Pipes in a area away from your city and surround it with trees to minimize ground pollution. As soon as you have access to the Sewage Treatment Plant build it, close the Sewage Outflow Pipes and destroy them when they get empty. After this plant some threes on the place to eliminate the ground pollution left (Keep in mind it may take a long time and you may need to replant the trees several times).

**Water pollution**

If you place a Water Tower or Water Pumping Stating above polluted ground, it will suck polluted water, which will make your Sims sick. Just avoid placing your water sources above or near polluted ground.

**Wellness Center**

Besides eliminating pollution, which is the main cause of germs, you can also help Sims to eliminate germs through the Wellness Center, which is an add on the the Hospital. Each Wellness Center will provide a wellness van, which will visit and clean buildings, removing the germs for some time.

*TLDR: in order to eliminate germs, eliminate pollution or build residential/commercial areas away from pollution, and have as much Wellness Centers as possible.*

I bought my game from gamestop and if I could return it, I would because I 'd just like to play the game, ""broken"" or not. But I can't.

At the same time, as I understand, the simulation still works correctly, i.e. it still tracks those sims, it just fudges the displayed numbers.

This is quite inconvenient when you try to understand how many and what type of zones/buildings you need to add/modify in your city. For example, I see that I have 1000 tourist in the city, is it real 1000? Does it mean that I can build casinos/gambling houses with capacity close to 1000 and provided that they all go there I will be able to fill them up? Or is it just fudged up 100? There are a lot of similar questions that require better understanding of the actual numbers of sims.

So, here is suggestion, can you give us an option to display the actual number of the sims, that can be enabled/disabled? I understand that it will be much lower number (10 times lower for larger cities) but I personally do not care. It is better for me to see the actual number of sims, then to see 200,000 and trying to guess that it is likely 30,000 of actual sims in the city.

They came and said we're sorry but we're only developers. We can't do anything about it. Okay I get that.

But what about now? Now that the obvious GAME DESIGN has problems, numbers not matching up, pathing AI being crap and leading to unmeasurable health, fire, crime and traffic problems bringing your city to a stand still. What about the region ""sharing"" because it's nothing more then that. Buying everything is so cheap there is literally no reason to make anything of your own. Because buying is done at ridiculously low price.

Please don't tell me this is working as ""intended"" and is supposed to be ""easy to learn hard to master"" because it's not it's just dumb AI plain and simple. I kept more or less quiet thinking well, servers will be fixed sooner or later. City sharing will be done too. I had no real problems with the internet DRM bullshit. 

But now, now the more I play them more I see. Didn't the beta testers see this? Were they like ""oh it's just a beta""? I mean it's very PAINFULLY obvious after playing the game for like 12 hours that there so many flaws. I'm not even actively searching for them, they just appear. Numbers don't match, traffic gets stuck like crazy, firefighters let buildings burn down because they focus ONE SINGLE BUILDING out of 10 and theres 10 of them.

I think that when the removed search filtering temporarily in order to hunt for server problems, it messed with the flagging of private regions. Either that, or there is no flagging to begin with, and the search filter just makes it so that private regions don't show up. No filter, no private regions.

My solution for the time being is going to be to claim all of the cities in my new region immediately upon creating it in order to block anyone else from coming in.

lots of you hace reported missing submissions and deleted content, thank you for your notes! I apologize for this mishap - it was a technical problem. I just went through the whole list since yesterday and manually approved every single submission. If your submission is still stuck, please report here.

**Here's the explanation:** We didn't delete these threads manually - our AutoModerator went berserk because I made a mistake in its configuration.

**Background:** AutoModerator is a great tool by /u/deimorz that helps with mod work (auto-approving things out of the reddit spam-filter, deleting spam etc.). Recently, Deimorz has allowed mods to determine AutoModerator's behaviour themselves via the wiki. During the setup, I made a mistake that caused AutoModerator to delete every single submission (and some top-level comments as well) since yesterday, 11:43 UTC. Like I said above, I manually re-approved all of these submissions, took out the AutoModerator settings and everything should be back to normal now.

***tl;dr:*** I made a mistake setting up AutoModerator, which caused it to remove every new post for the last 19 hours. This has been fixed and I re-approved all these submissions – if yours is still stuck, please post in here.

*  Remake SimCity 4 with a fully functional traffic system
*  Region gameplay would allow to seamlessly build one large system effectively reducing agent load but allowing to craft a million-sized city divided into burrows/zones/neighbourhoods 
*  Utilities are used locally and excess utilities are traded to other zones in the region
*  Agents are representative of data and not a function of it
*  Utilities flow without using roads but in the case of police/fire/freighters are influenced by transit
*  Mass transit/public transports allows effective connections between all regions
*  Build-able ports and airports 
*  Online component similar to Steam Workshop: you can post mods, Maxis/EA could sell their own graphical bullshit items and minor stuff like facebook integration, city stats, leaderboards, etc, are all optional fluff. No online gameplay required.
*  RCI fully works but it's possible to create Residental or Industrial or Commercial only zones provided you have effective commuting capability (allowing for industrial border industries, inner city commerce and low density wealthy suburbs as well as high density poorer inner city zones.

That was a relatively large -- but still not maximum -- city. Those gridlocked cars, for the most part, were going to/from work, completely ignoring the mass transit on every corner.

We shouldn't have to plan cities with a single road for things to run effectively. I'd love to know what the rationale is behind these pathfinding systems, and if we can maybe expect an upgrade in the weeks to come.

I can no longer get accurate data on Test (as of 13/3/19), because I'm getting *401 Authentication Required* when I try to query.

Here is the logins by date information. This is a count of the latest date a screen name logged into the server. The game was released on 3/5, so any logins which occurred before that were preview/dev/beta logins which were never used again.
You can see a spike on 13/2/27, which coincides with the date of the beta test. The total of pre-release logins are 1908

It should be noted that I started gathering this data on 13/3/17, and once I successfully scraped a user's data, I haven't updated it. Some of this data is up to 3 days old, and players may have logged in since then. I will try to update my scrape data at some point, but I'd rather not hit the servers more than what is necessary to satisfy my curiosity.

The total number of unique screen names is **1078474**, minus the pre-release names puts the total at **1076566**. This number is about 30k short of the 1.1 million sales, but it is reasonable to expect that those sales have not yet activated their game, thus would not exist on the servers. The number has grown by 68905 since my original scrape at 13/3/18 [(original post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1aicwk/publicly_available_data_scraped_unique_user_count/)",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1363812928.0,,,True,t3_1ao25q,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ao25q/more_user_statistics/,

Just look at it! Tell me it isn't everything you ever wanted in a Grand Theft Auto game. They've taken the best aspects from each previous iteration as a *baseline*, and did they stop there? No, they built on it, they innovated by allowing you to play multiple points of view characters. And they made everything you know bigger and better using the current level of technology to push this new title to great heights. It's already clear that what we see is going to be a killer game. How do we know this? Because Rockstar knows what fans loved about GTA, and they fucking just made it bigger and better. Watch that gameplay trailer, and ask yourself this one question:  the decisions for these game mechanics, was it made with the player in mind? Fuck yes.

Now, you know where I'm going with this, right? Maxis, all you had to do -- seriously, *all* you had to do, was take everything that was fucking awesome with SimCity 4, and that means pretty much 90% of it, and make it fucking better. Fully 3d and bigger cities, curved roads, better graphics, deeper simulation, more things to control, more things to customize, bigger regions -- in other words, take the best of what was before you, and make it better because we have the technology.

I understand you took a gamble to reboot the game, and it's a fucking shadow of what should be a great game, a ghost of a once-awesome franchise, killed at the feet of DRM and developer hubris.

You had to re-purpose areas, decide where you should expand, and what the purpose of the expansion was.  For me that is where the challenge was, using all the data views to help make that decision. 



In SC5, because there is so little space, there is not a lot of challenge left.  I see a blank city tile, layout some general areas and then fill in.  The next step is where it becomes harder and more fun, and that next step doesn't really exist.

I think the engine despite its faults is decent, and hopefully will be tweaked to make it a bit more sensible.  Without larger plots whats the point?  I can fill almost every empty space in the city before I hit any real challenges, and have given up on regional play because it doesn't really seem to work.

Has anyone gotten regional commuting to work in a decent way?

I'll do my best to relay any issues that come up here to the rest of the team, but those aforementioned links will be your best bet.

Complete [change list](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9453150.page) below:

Update 2.0 Notes

What’s New

* Mayors Mansion: Mayors will now drive their fancy cars to work. Mayor will take their helicopter, limo, or sports car if the modules are present. 

* Data maps: Now show in their normal color when a color filter is enabled (unless in a colorblind mode)

* HUD: Now color-corrects when in a colorblind mode.

Fixes and Updates

* Cities not Processing: Mitigates some of the issues that were causing cities not to process. We are continuing to work on and improve this issue.

* Region Filters: Now sorts regions with available cities to the top

* Invitations: Invitations to join a region should be sent and received more quickly.

* Tourism: Fixes for unexplained fluctuation of tourists. Tourists more smartly counted on transit.

* Cruise ships should now be a lot more effective at bringing medium and high wealth tourists in coastal cities.

* New tourists will now decide to come into a city once leaving tourists reach train stations, bus depots, or cruise ship docs instead of waiting for those tourists to go out to the region first.

* This change should reduce the downtime of tourist buildings.

* Casinos: Casinos tuned so that Gambling will be a more profitable specialty. Players must bulldoze and replace existing casinos to see effects of tuning.

* The larger casinos now invite more tourists into the city which helps keep them full.

* Note that existing casinos will need to be replaced to take advantage of this change.

* More Casinos: Raised module limit on Sci-Fi and Sleek Casinos to 6 modules.  

* Region Play: Cash gifts can now be received in a bankrupt city.

* Education: Fixed school buses getting stuck at the high school. Existing Schools will fix themselves.

* Education: Fixed school buses picking up students at neighboring cities that didn’t have school bus stops. 

* Education: Fix to more accurately track regional student population.

* Education: Fix where kids leaving the school bus stop would teleport to the nearest pedestrian path instead of walking directly into the school. 

* Education: University wings now give the proper bonus.

* Recycling: Fix for the Recycling Center where it would sometimes stop working, recycling services will visit other cities.

* Air pollution: Fixed issue where air pollution would appear to come from nowhere. Fix issues where your regional air pollution would be reflected back into your box for a double penalty.  

* Fire Service: Fire Trucks don’t clump, dispatch to fires more efficiently.

* Water: Water pumps are now capable of pumping water from rivers at a larger radius so they can take better advantage of the water table in a city.

* Disasters:  Some players were getting hit too frequently with random disasters, this introduces a cooldown where no random disasters will occur.

* Trade: Fix for trade ports that suddenly stop shipping. 

* Transit: Street Cars and Buses go to high volume stops first.

* Transit: A city with residents and public transit will now provide the accurate amount of workers and shoppers to its neighbors.

* Transit: A transit vehicle stuck in a pick-up or drop off loop will now go back to a garage instead of trying to pick up more people.

* Transit vehicles should recover automatically after the update. If players want to force the recovery, turn off the stops that are having looping issues, wait a few game hours, then turn them back on. 

* Transit:  Neighbors buses will now come in lower numbers into the city and do a better job at picking up local passengers first. 

* Traffic: Medium density roads now create traffic lights at intersections with other roads and avenues of equal or higher density.

* Residential Tuning: Residential-only cities have failure state.

* Buildings are prevented from going up in density when they don’t have power or water.

* The amount of happiness gained from low taxes, police, fire, and health outreach has been lowered.

* Fixed some cases where buildings would not go abandoned when they should have.

* Higher density residential buildings are no longer blocked from going abandoned due to not having enough money.

* Happiness from low taxes does not double up every time it is given.

* Losing happiness due to not having a job is more impactful.

* Budgets: Fixed bug with monthly transactions being used to get around systems pushing back.  

* Systems like fire, abandonment, garbage, sewage don’t turn on until you've made a certain amount of money.  Gifts from neighbors are taken into account as well.

* You can no longer create a city that never gets fires, crime, health, or other pushback issues.

* Income progression (which we use to turn on pushback systems) was not including transactions from gifts, global market sales, or loans.

* Income progression should always go up regardless if you have higher expenses. It is the total income that you are bringing in from your city that turns on pushback systems.

* Audio: Fixes issue where audio will stop working after creating a large city or where phantom audio sounds play in a city.

* Demolish: Fixes issue that occurred when players demolished buildings that had service vehicles, delivery vehicles, or agents out in the city or region. Previously, the agents would be in a state of limbo and would not recover when new buildings of that type were placed. This will no longer happen.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1366680242.0,,maxisflair,True,t3_1cwkid,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1cwkid/update_20_is_live/,

Enter at your own peril, thoughtful participants appreciated ;)

For the complete article head over to EA: http://www.ea.com/news/simcity-update-straight-answers-from-lucy

Having played Simcity 2013 since launch I wanted to take a second to response to the recent post on EA.com from Maxis General Manager Lucy Bradshaw.  First off, I love playing Simcity and have since my first experiences getting abducted by aliens as a 13 year old.  This is not intended to add to the epic bash fest that has sprung up around the internet, but rather to accurately reflect my experiences and to directly response to her claims in the article.  
One basis for numerous complaints about the game is the always online requirement, which Lucy explains as not an attempt to control players but rather the foundation of a new shared multiplayer experience for Simcity.  I have to say the multiplayer functions are a really nice addition.  The concept of sharing resources, workers, gifting when disaster strikes and collaborating on epic projects really does capture the imagination.  The first time I caught a glimpse of a glimmering skyline in the distance really made me smile.  Need fire trucks, help is one the way!  Breaking the bank?  Load up the armored car!  Boy did those tools add a lot to my game play experience at the outset.   I began to imagine my sims having a life, and the cities around me as part of that life.  So for that Maxis/EA I thank you.  All that said imagination and reality are different things.
 
Ok with my highest praise out of the way let us explore some of the claims made in the article and how they relate to my experience with the game.  The following statements were given as examples of how the online requirement serves to enhance gameplay not just arbitrarily control players. 

1.	“We keep the simulation state of the region up to date for all players.  Even when playing solo, this keeps the interactions between cities up to date in a shared view of the world.”
I assume this statement refers to the fact that even when a player is offline resources shared with the region are still made available to active players.  This system means that if I send you fire trucks and then log off, the trucks will still continue to function in your city while Im away.  I don’t have any specific complaints about the offline continuation of the services, but since many of the services are intermittent to begin with it provides little benefit.  Recycling centers are bugged for example and once they stop working the trucks will stop collecting as well.  Sometimes vehicles sent to another city will get caught in traffic before they even arrive, blocked by a bug detailed below.  All in all, the feature she describes does work, but given the instability of resource sharing in general what does it matter that an offline player can share too?

2.	“Players who want to reach the peak of each specialization can count on surrounding cities to provide services or resources, even workers.  As other players build, your city can draw on their resources.”
Counting on surrounding cities for resources and workers is almost completely broken.  Getting regional commuters is great, I have 800 jobs you have 800 workers: they will commute, genius!  In practice, a bug replicates the number of commuters when they don’t reach their destination in time.  This means that traffic preventing commuters from reaching their destination will infinitely spawn commuters trying to enter your town, completely shutting down a city.  Everyone I play with has encountered inexplicably massive traffic sufficient to shut down a city.  Sharing resources is also problematic as a 50MW surplus of power shows up as far less in the menu to actually purchase power regionally.  This means players with excess can’t actually sell that excess and players with need can’t actually fill those needs.  Water, when purchased from the regional market, suffers from frequent and inexplicable “brown outs” which can cripple a city.  The solution?  Don’t rely on regional resources or commuters.

3.	“Our Great Works rely on contributions from multiple cities in a region.  Connected services keep each player’s contributions updated and the progression on Great Works moving ahead.”
Adding resources to a great work area seems to function on initial testing.  Unlocking the process was democratic in that several people have to agree on the project, then wait for “project approval” and head on the way.  The effects of the great work once completed leave something to be desired however.   Tourists seem to inexplicably vanish after a period of encouraging success.  I will leave the jury out on this one, as these are hard to put together and have been tested the least of the games features.

4.	“All of our social world features - world challenges, world events, world leaderboards and world achievements - use our servers to update the status of all cities.”
All these features are currently disabled.  The challenges menu recently became active but will not start for 3 days.  At this time, none of the features listed are available in the game.  However, Maxis assures us they will return presently and I believe they will deliver.

5.	“Our servers handle gifts between players.”
Gifts between players can buttress flagging economies, aid in major investments and create good will among players.  The mechanism works by creating a little truck which travels from one town to the other carrying the resources/money.  In my experience gifts are problematic and unreliable.  They can take hours of real time to arrive and often do not arrive at all.  This mechanism barely works and is useful only as a last resort.  How can I know an hour in advance that someone will be in trouble?  You send the gift when the need arises and hope, but often it does not arrive or arrives too late to matter.

6.	“We’ve created a dynamic supply and demand model for trading by keeping a Global Market updated with changing demands on key resources.”
I have yet to see any indication that global prices fluctuate at all.  I assume these features are disabled as well.  Commodities sell for the same price in every city I create, regardless of the volume I produce.  I would love to see prices fluctuate as it would encourage greater diversification, but as it stands I have yet to experience this feature in gameplay.

7.	“We update each city’s visual representation as well.  If you visit another player’s city, you’ll see the most up to date visual status.”
This feature does work, and has seen some improvements as of late.  It comes in two forms, first is a view from your city of the horizon which graphically depicts a static image of regional cities.  It represents the city well and really caught me off guard when I started playing the game.  I love this feature.  The second aspect comes in the ability to visit other cities.  In this mode you enter the city view of another mayor for a detailed inspection of their hard working sims.   It works in that you can see and interact with their city a bit, but game conditions are often sorely out of sync.  Modifications to the city do not show up in real time and the city itself offers a view of how it was,  some undetermined time in the past;  all this despite messages about “syncing cities” when initiating a visit.

8.	“We even check to make sure that all the cities saved are legit, so that the region play, leaderboards, challenges and achievements rewards and status have integrity.”
Ok this is a nod to DRM.  Checking to ensure that a city is “legit” means verifying that no conditions outside their scheme of control have taken place.  Can it mean anything else?  Pretty unclear as to what exactly they verify since a prominent mod of the game recently revealed a debug mode allowing modifications outside city bounds which are save-able.   “Verification” tools like this have been used in other games to ban players using modifications to game code, and often serve to quell user explorations into how code can change and improve.  I suspect it will serve the same purpose here, no real game play features to speak of, just her being honest about an important feature of their always online requirement.  It is not arbitrary control from their point of view since businesses view this as a means to prevent loss.  The efficacy of that technique is probably debatable but I’ll leave that alone.  

The game as it stands is enjoyable if a bit under-cooked.  The online potential of the game is clear.  When those features are fully enabled, the game it will be everything she claims in the article.  But for now, the unreliability of resource sharing encourages totally self-sufficient cities which avoid regional features.  The game feels a bit like a single player game you cant play offline, and an online game you cant play with friends.  Caught between these two extremes Maxis has some work to do convincing the community that their intentions were always about getting a truly multi-player experience into Simcity.  For an MMO style game, they seem to struggle with even the most basic multi-player experiences.  More likely this game was designed the way all city builders are for the personal experience of creating a unique and lifelike city.  The online conditions of the game arrive through a desire to expand the franchise into the increasingly profitable realm of online play while guaranteeing powerful protection against piracy and unauthorized user modifications.  I would urge EA and Maxis to embrace the fervent community of fans in crowd sourcing solutions to these problems.  Surely tens of thousands can accomplish more than a few dozen.  It would ingratiate a loyal player base, improve technical communication between players and developers, and probably help out over worked programmers facing a seriously up-hill battle.  But hey what do I know, Im no game executive.

Stop patronizing us. Stop calling us ""fans,"" stop treating us like kids, and stop insulting our intelligence.

Just come out and say ""yes, piracy was a heavy factor in our decision to include always-on DRM. We included it because we like our jobs and want to get paid for the work we did.""

Simple as that. People are cracking the DRM as I type this, and they won't stop. The game hasn't been built from the ground up with online in mind (maybe the third floor or so, but not the local simulations.) If you stop ignoring the elephant in the room and just sincerely come clean quite a lot of people (myself included) will think much higher of you, Maxis, and EA in general.

I hope that this doesn't fall on deaf ears, all we want as customers and consumers (not fans. Fans of what SimCity can be, perhaps, but not fans of you) is transparancy and sincerity. Can you do that?

1364254019.0,153,self.SimCity,1b08hf,I can admit it - and I'm bowing out (The Twitter Bomb),Niclistin,218,65,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1b08hf/i_can_admit_it_and_im_bowing_out_the_twitter_bomb/,"Yesterday this Tweet happened on Twitter: @holtmiester:

@MaxisGuillaume I just made a 500K+ city. No I, No C. No other citys and no parks. So its not just parks to blame.
@holtmiester where did your Sims get their happiness from? Other nearby cities?

I happened to have Guill on my Twitter usually for the sole purpose of having a question answered (or ignored) or to get information on what's going on with the ""simulation.""

When that Tweet happened I was in game (after having created another region since mine was ""missing"" and chimed in with: https://twitter.com/MaxisGuillaume/status/315872614759403521

I am the top tweet but not the person who began the conversation.

What's missing from the entire conversation is my explanation about how you don't need Industrial regardless of whether you have other cities providing happiness. I tagged the first tweet as ""clueless"" because as we have learned from that entire conversation - he was. In fact three more messages came from Guill the last one telling me to go ask one of the other devs - when that's all he really had to say.

Was typing ""clueless"" mean or wrong? I guess that's your perception. Our household bought 6 copies of the Deluxe Edition. In the US that equates to 480.00 our family spent for a game that doesn't work as intended. There's nothing Deluxe about cities burning down, region play not working, regions being deleted, cities being constantly rolled back, busses being stuck, cars being stuck, pedestrians blocking traffic, brown and missing textures that make your city look like crap when you're zoomed out, criminals that won't leave your city, 500,000 visitors you can't get rid of and honestly - the list goes on and on.

But even in all of that I still have tried to stay in the middle of the problems, continue playing and have posted publically here time and time again that hopefully they will fix this mess. Disagree it's a mess if you wish - but a quick search around the internet will put you squarely in the minority.

I have used my Twitter account to post every bug, every picture of a bug I could find. Social Media can be effective for getting change and getting things fixed.

The last straw for me was when I realized Maxis was blocking people for asking questions and asking for clarification. If you're an adult and you're on Twitter and a tweet as tagged as ""clueless"" and you feel you shipped a quality game then I don't know what to tell you.

Was it insulting? No more insulting than the state of the game my family paid almost $500.00 for. That's insulting. As a matter of fact we play a lot of games. We have extensive libraries and we can't think of one other game that has had these amount of issues still in tact a month after launch and where the devs have blown as much smoke as we've gotten this month.

We have had at best, marginal server fixes, a marginal traffic fix and are told that more fixes are coming ""soon."" Soon is the word we've heard for weeks now. Soon, soon and soon. No explanation, no idea what's coming - absolutely no reassurance and if you ask those tough questions - you're blocked and no longer matter even though YOU shipped this crap game. Your vision stinks by the way whoever dreamed this one up.

And so - to the delight of many Redditor's and the Delight of Maxis - we're done. AMEX has refunded our 480.00 bucks and we are not coming back. We don't care about our Origin games, we've deleted the origin client and we'll spend our money on Steam where service is a tad more reliable anyway.

480.00 bucks may not hit you in the wallet but again, we don't care. We're done with EA and done with Maxis and with the condescending remarks we're apparently deserving of because you shipped a flawed game.

To everyone else who can stick with it, I salute you - sincerely. I hope the game works out for everyone and that this SubReddit goes back to a place of being optimism as it was before the disgusting AMA that happened here.

The team is actively investigating connection issues (“Unable to Connect to Server” messages) and general trading lag while in game.

- *Roman Casino*
Yes, I know you've already seen [this](http://oi47.tinypic.com/2ezs94h.jpg), but I found more proof:

        ""0x0d54dae4"" : ""Roman Casino"",
            ""0x0d54db33"" : ""Penthouse"",
            ""0x0ea79611"" : ""Roman Rooms (Ground Floor)"",
            ""0x0ea79677"" : ""Roman Rooms (Tower)"",
            ""0x0ea79a17"" : ""Brazier Sign"",

This was in the file where all of the city specialization buildings in the game are listed, along with their module names. Possible DLC? [Could this be it?](http://i.imgur.com/kQQYHz0.png)

In another part of the code in the module descriptions, I found this:

          ""0x0ea7972c"" : ""Hail Mayor! May Fortuna smile upon your casino efforts! Attracts medium-wealth tourists
          to gamble at this imposing anachronistic casino."",
          ""0x0ea78b40"" : ""Have your rich Sims stay like Caesar. Veni, Vidi, Dormivi!"",
          ""0x0e93b531"" : ""Establish the base of your Roman Casino hotel empire 
          with this block of rooms!"",
          ""0x0e95483a"" : ""Caesar towers over all! Use this tower of rooms to create 
          a hotel-casino. Tourists will stay in lodging to spend any remaining Simoleons
          in the casino the next day."",
          ""0x0ea79a77"" : ""You'll be praising Jupiter with all the tourists 
          that arrive at your Roman Casino with this important-looking sign!"",
          ""0x0ea79ae5"" : ""Summon a legion of tourists to your Roman Casino with this proud marquee sign!"",


- *Coal Strip Mine Great Work*
A Coal Strip Mine is in the list of Great Works

        ""0x0d92684d"" : ""Coal Strip Mine"",
        ""0x0d92684e"" : ""Coal Strip Mine Construction"",
        ""0x0d92684f"" : ""Coal Strip Mine Site"",

Also somewhere else in the code:

        ""0x0c11961a"" : ""Build Strip Mine"",
        ""0x0c11961b"" : ""You have started building a Strip Mine! Invitations 
        have been sent to your neighbors to join!"",
        ""0x0c11962a"" : ""Join Strip Mine"",
        ""0x0c11962b"" : ""You just joined your neighbor to build the Strip Mine! Don't get too dirty together!"",
        ""0x0c11963a"" : ""Upgrade Strip Mine"",
        ""0x0c11963b"" : ""An extra plot of land will now be dug up to bits in the unending search for Coal!"",



- *RoboTank Disaster*
In the file listing all of the disasters, there is also one for a ""Robotank"". 

    0x0dbfc53a"" : ""RoboTank"",

Of course, this disaster was most likely later replaced by the Godzilla disaster. [Could this be it?](http://i.imgur.com/B2cQfMW.png)


- *Power Plant Batteries*
I know the developers already said they took them out because they were too complicated, but they were still in the code.

    ""0x0d3a856e"" : ""Solar Storage Batteries"",
    ""0x0d2e3fd1"" : ""Wind Storage Batteries"",



- *Education Used to be a specialization!*

In a list of specializations, there is a category for education. Later taken out in the full game.

    ""//"" : ""Specializations:"", 
    ""0x0e54630b"" : ""METALS"",
    ""0x0e54630c"" : ""PETROLEUM"",
    ""0x0e54630d"" : ""GAMBLING "",
    ""0x0e54630e"" : ""ELECTRONICS"",
    ""0x0e54630f"" : ""TRADE"",
    ""0x0e1cf6b5"" : ""EDUCATION"",




- **List for future DLC???**

Finally, there is a list of what seems to be upcoming DLC. Of course, the ""hot air balloon DLC"" that was leaked a while ago is in the list. Take a look! In the list: ""Transport Air Ship Blimp"", ""Worship buildings"", Some kind of military buildings, ""Army Base"", ""Symphony Hall"", ""Planetarium"", ""Amusement Park"", ""Nissan Charging Station"", and finally, a ""Red Cross Base"", maybe a hospital?

As the title says, some of the devs here at the studio are doing another AMAA tomorrow.

Some of you have seen me popping into your posts here and there so I thought I'd make a formal introduction as well.
My name's Richard Shemaka and I'm the lead engineer/designer behind data layers in SimCity! You'll be seeing more of me around here, largely clarifying misconceptions and spreading tidbits of information.

I'd love to answer a few small questions, but try to save the bulk of it for tomorrow.

Looking forward to chatting on here more often!


*Edit: That's all the question answering I'm gonna do for now, you'll need to tune in tomorrow for the main event!*

How About You?,turokman2000,250,101,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1atr0t/this_is_why_im_quitting_simcity_how_about_you/,"Sure, the server issue sucked.  Yes, the simulation is terrible, with stupid traffic and broken RCI.

However, there's still fun to be had with this game right?  Wrong.

First, having cities get corrupted then lost means no incentive to ever work hard on one again.  This is a very very big deal.

Second, the region system is so broken.  I want to get over the server and DRM issue, but the feature that's supposed to make it all necessary, that I'm trying to convince myself to like, doesn't even work.  I'd love to build a great work with friends, but resources are unevenly distributed.  The game doesn't really know whether a great work is completed or not half the time.  Second, regional data is terribly inconsistent.  Why provide garbage trucks to a neighbor when they might not arrive?

Worst of all, there's no matchmaking.  It's really hard to find people to play with unless you know somebody.  Regions are full or empty.

The whole thing is a disaster.

And finally, as engrossing as city specialization and great works could have been, it's still so limited.  So you max out a city?  So what?  You build a great work.  Great, so now you can max out your city with great work perks.  But wait, you already did.  And they max out so fast.  And, why build an industrial city when freight is broken, and commuting is broken, and intercity play is a joke, for example.

Look, when the devs release a video a month after launch explaining how they're working a 'fix' so traffic isn't absolutely stupid - that's called a broken game.  GlassBox was a great concept, they just didn't flesh it out.  Can you imagine the time they wasted engineering the game getting the servers to barely function?  What a joke EA.

First of all I want to thank Maxis for actually including those new indicators which show up how much room a plot will take when zoning, we asked for something like it and they delivered however as it currently stands it isn't all that useful to us, mostly because they only show up when we are about to actually make the plot rather than being available to see when we are planning our roads.

My suggestion to fix this is that whenever we have a road tool selected, could we also have all the zones that we currently have shown, as well as those new bars to show how large the plots can expand up to? This would make it so much easier to plan around instead of having to roughly guess exactly where those lines reached to.

1364234164.0,136,self.SimCity,1azhry,It's not SimCity 5. It's a SimCity reboot with a lot of unfinished work.,MaxisHelper,241,105,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1azhry/its_not_simcity_5_its_a_simcity_reboot_with_a_lot/,"OK, so feel free to downvote me to oblivion, but I am going to come at this from a completely different point of view than most of the posts here. I will however, preface this entire post with the full admission that I have been frustrated with the game since minute one of release. Perhaps though, I've moved onto a stage of grief which some of you have yet to reach--acceptance. I went through a confusion stage, a frustration stage, a denial stage where I tried everything to get commuting and casinos to work, I even gave the game up for about a week once I realized these things were simply broken. I've moved on. I've accepted reality.

I've accepted the fact that this game was released earlier than it should have been. Those in development must have known about the issues we are all seeing--even with the most recent patch (1.8 as I write this). They should have seen the convoys of busses, emergency vehicles, and garbage trucks. Now that the servers are mostly delay free (gifts are pretty immediate, syncing of power, sewage, etc. is mostly delay-free), we still have major issues with commuting. With commuting broken, the small size of the cities is horribly apparent. My initial desire to overcome the small city size was to utilize the region fully and build my residential cities and my industrial cities separately and have my people commute. This does not work yet.

So here is where I get to my point... ""YET"" is my point. It seems that the development team is still working diligently on fixing what they know is broken and can fix quickly, pushing out patches, and staying involved more than ever before on networks like Twitter. It seems like a big patch is coming--unlike the smaller ""quick"" fixes we've seen through 1.8: https://twitter.com/MaxisGuillaume/status/316224351361978370

I would bet that the long-term goal for SimCity is a model not unlike The Sims, where they continue to make money off expansion packs. With that said, even with the bad press so far, I highly doubt the executives are going to pull the plug on the game and just stop development--they sold a lot of copies. More likely they will eventually get the game to a place where it should have been at launch--all features working and optimally tuned. Commuters commuting, students traveling to universities, Fire trucks not traveling in a conga-line, busses reducing traffic problems, not creating them, etc.

In the end, this is what I've come to accept… I paid full price for a beta. I expected a near flawless experience, but became a QA engineer. Here's the thing though... I was so eager to play, I signed up for the betas and played as much as I could while they were online. If they offered an open ended beta for the full price of the game, I would have paid it, and essentially had the experience I've had thus far. Once the commuting, tourists, and conga-lines are fixed, the game (IMO) will be ready for release and we can start looking forward to expansions--bigger cities, different resources, all that good stuff. Too bad the game is already out there and everyone has a bad taste in their mouth now, but again, this is reality. I would encourage everyone out there to join my thinking. Not for the sake of the money-makers, but for your own mental well-being. 

Bad decisions were made to rush this thing out the door without fully grasping the consequences. The gaming community is one of the most connected groups in our society. By nature we are online more than the average consumer, and we take advantage of all of the networks that allow us to vent, rage, and commiserate. You can't fuck us over and think it will be taken lying down. Most people, I feel, are frustrated by the fact that they paid for a broken game. I'm in my 30's now so $50 or whatever for a game is really nothing for me given the hours of entertainment I get--I mean a meal out that lasts for a couple hours costs me more. But for some of the kids out there that have to scrape together the dough to buy each game they do--well they're the ones who truly got screwed when they bough SimCity over their other choices at the time. In the end, I'm confident they'll get what they paid for, but that's not going to settle any of the rage we all are currently feeling.

Here's what I'm doing now to enjoy the game as much as possible… I'm building cities that don't need commuting. Small cities, mostly all below 200k population. I'm sharing utilities to keep clean cities clean. I'm setting up mining cities, university cities, gambling cities (where casinos lose tons of money unfortunately), etc. These cities will all be there when the big fixes come out. At that point I'll have fun converting them to the specialized residential centers, or industrial centers I want them to eventually be. When we can expand their size, they will have a history in them for sure--albeit a tortured one in my memory.

Let's encourage the good folks doing their job every day developing the fixes we crave (they aren't the ones that pushed this out the door too early). Let's try to give as much constructive criticism as possible, praise where good things are done, and have some patience while we experience first hand the development process in a game series we all have grown to love deep down. This is just my point of view. I acknowledge you all have the right to be as pissed off as you like--never buy an EA game again, write the deservedly poor reviews, rant here and elsewhere, make hilarious memes, but let's keep in mind if we get what we really want, this game will be great in the end, expansion packs will come out with cool new features, and we'll all be as addicted as we remember being to the originals in the good old days. If they keep up the development, just imagine where things will be in 5 years or more. The core concept will really allow for amazing growth of the series--they needed to reboot, it's just unfortunate how it's gone so far. All in all though it hasn't been a month yet. We have years to enjoy what they are building.

One last thing: a plea to the executives. Please don't let the troubles of the last few weeks kill this thing. The concept may be cracked in places, but the potential is amazing. The people might not forget, but they'll surely forgive if you keep up your end and have your teams fix what needs to be fixed. Once that is done, EXPANSIONS!!

TL:DR: Accepted reality, trying to help, being patient for the fixes that will surely come. Enjoying what I know works for now. You should too.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,True,t3_1azhry,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1azhry/its_not_simcity_5_its_a_simcity_reboot_with_a_lot/,
