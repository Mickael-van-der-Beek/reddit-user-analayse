Everything below is what I needed to be able to manage a core server, with the intent of a main 2012 server with a GUI being the managment host.  I'm still missing a simple Powershell v3 command to be able to modify the local admins group easily.  If anyone knows one please enlighten me.  I'll also update with the additional commands I used to open the firewall for remoting.  I'm wondering if enable-psremoting would be sufficient.      
  

**Update:**  Have a much simpler way to add to local admins group now.  
**Update 2:**  Learned about SCONFIG utility.  This is a configuration utility that comes with core OS installs.  It will allow you to configure many of the things listed below.  Very useful for manually configuring Networking, Domain Membership, and Remote Management.

1376664039.0,36,self.PowerShell,1khn9o,A fun script for Friday - make your friend's computer start talking to him/her,Sinisterly,38,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1khn9o/a_fun_script_for_friday_make_your_friends/,"A co-worker of mine stumbled upon [this nifty blog article](http://pmckibbins.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/powershell-text-to-speech/) on how to make a text-to-speech call using PowerShell.

The article gives two examples:

* Call the SAPI.SPVoice COM object

* Load the reference to System.Speech

Where can this come in fun? Well, if you throw PSRemoting in, of course! In my testing, if you use the second method (or the pared down script below) you can make your victim's computer start talking to him or her. Here's how you do it:

1. Provide a distraction so that your victim leaves their computer unlocked, and make yourself administrator on their workstation (only needed if you aren't already an admin!)

2. Enable PSRemoting on their workstation. A method for doing this would be using [PSExec](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx):

        psexec.exe /acceptEula \\(yourVictimsComputer) -d -h -s powershell.exe """"Enable-PSRemoting -Force""""""

3. Start a new PSSession connecting to their workstation:

        New-PSSession -ComputerName YourVictimsComputer

4. Load this function:

        function Say-Text {
            param ([Parameter(Mandatory=$true, ValueFromPipeline=$true)] [string] $Text)
            [Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('System.Speech') | Out-Null   
            $object = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer 
            $object.Speak($Text) 
        }

5. Ensure that their volume is on. (For example, say, ""Hey I just found this really funny video!"")

6. Start speaking to them by calling the function you just made:

        Say-Text ""I'm afraid I can't do that Dave""

Have fun, and don't scare anyone too much :)

1373892626.0,32,self.PowerShell,1ic49m,How to (usefully) encrypt and store credentials.,meepstah,34,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1ic49m/how_to_usefully_encrypt_and_store_credentials/,"I noted this in the other thread about credentials and figured more folks would see it here.  The problem, as pointed out, is that your computer is used to generate the encryption key when you encrypt a string with convertto-securestring.  That means if you try to run the script on another computer, the decryption will fail since you'll have the wrong key.  

The solution is to provide your own key.  You can store it somewhere secure, or stick it in a text file, or really whatever you like.  You can think of it as a two-part password:  You need the encrypted password data and you need the key.  

So, step one:  Make a key.  It's just an array of 24 numbers between 0 and 255.  You can do it manually or stick it in a text file (one number per line).  Numbers can be anything you like within those bounds.  

So, 
    
    $key = (1,2,3,4,5,......,23,24)

Then, you encrypt: 

    Read-Host -AsSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString -Key $key | Out-File .\adminpw.dat

And maybe put your key in a file too. 

    $key &gt; ./keyfile.dat

To use it, then: 

    $key = cat ./keyfile.dat
    $password = cat ./adminpw.dat | ConvertTo-SecureString -Key $key

Perfectly safe, right?  No one can even see the password since you were super savvy and encrypted a secure string in the first place. 

Except securestrings suck. 

    $decrypted = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($password))


That's right, you can reach into the memory and yank it out any time (and so can anyone else with half a mind to find out how).  

So, the moral of the story is to keep your scripts out of the wrong hands.  Short of requiring an interactive password dialogue (no good for automation), I haven't come up with a genuinely secure way to store credentials.  

Speaking of which, you might be curious as to why you'd store them anyway.  Why not just schedule the script to run as a task, using Windows to store the credentials for the AT job?  Well, I've got one application for this that really can't be duplicated.  

Suppose you wanted to run a script against a bunch of servers, some of which are in the domain and some of which are not.  As long as you've synced up an administrative local account, you should be able to talk to everything (except domain controllers).  The caveat is that the domain must be the local computer name...which changes for each machine!

So, using the above code, I store the synced password as $password.  Then, for each box, I create a new cred: 

    $username = $computername + '\adminaccount'
    $cred = $cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential `
    -ArgumentList $username, $password 

Then call 

    invoke-command -credential $cred -computername $computername -scriptblock {get-process}

or whatever you want to run remotely, as a local administrator, on any list of boxes you like.

The report was to include:
  
- Username
- Display Name
- When the mailbox was created
- The last time the mailbox was accessed
  
Obtaining the first three fields was easy as they are returned by the Get-Mailbox cmdlet. The last access time, however is returned by the Get-MailboxStatistics cmdlet. Normally I would just echo the output of both commands to a file and let Excel parse it out but I wanted to use the native Export-CSV command this time. So I used Add-Member:
  
    $mbx = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited
    $mbx | foreach {Add-Member -InputObject $_ -Type noteproperty -Name LastLogonTime -Value (Get-MailboxStatistics $_.name).lastlogontime}
  
The second command loops through each mailbox and runs the command to retrieve the last time the mailbox was accessed. It then appends that information to the mailbox object as a property. Now that I have all my information in one object I can export the data easily:
  
    $mbx | select name,displayname,whencreated,lastlogontime | export-csv mailboxreport.csv

A few notes:

* All preferences can be configured with the variables at the beginning of the script
* `$Regions` and `$Searches` are arrays; you can define more than one
* All search strings can include [advanced craigslist search functions](http://www.craigslist.org/about/help/search)
* There are issues with results if you stray from the `cta` section (cars+trucks for sale), but it is easily adaptable to any section if you want to make it work elsewhere (housing, for example; mainly lines 107 through 125)

Then it groups them by (separately) subject and sender, and gives you the top 20 of each (minus any *.int domains, which are Exchange's internal messages.)

    Set-Location -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce'
    Set-ItemProperty -Path . -Name joinDomain -Value ""C:\scripts\joinDomain.ps1""

This will create a subkey in the RunOnce registry key (assuming you are running Vista/7/2008) named ""joinDomain"" with the value of ""C:\scripts\joinDomain.ps1""

It will write a two text files.  One text file will tell me what java's are install before I remove them, and the other file will tell me whats installed after the removal / install.

* I break down some of the code for Run-Parallel in [this post](http://ramblingcookiemonster.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/parallel-powershell-part-ii/)
* I list a number of references that discuss parallelization or performance in PowerShell [here](http://ramblingcookiemonster.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/parallel-powershell/)

* [Script Repository link for Foreach-Parallel](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Foreach-Parallel-Parallel-a8f3d22b)

These can be a big help.  I went from a domain wide query taking on the order of two days, down to 5 hours with an acceptable increase in bandwidth usage.  Your processor will be a major factor.

There may be a better way to implement runtime tracking for timeouts.  Waiting to hear back from the pros : )

*Update*:

* For Invoke-Parallel (Run-Parallel):  Modified the way timeouts are tracked.  Instead of queueing up all runspaces in the pool immediately, we set a threshold ('maxQueue') for the maximum number of runspaces to allow in a pool.  If we are at this limit, we check for completed runspaces and sleep a short while before trying to add a new runspace.

* Boe [posted an idea](http://powershell.org/discuss/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=801) on using nested runspaces (i.e. create intermediary runspaces to track timeouts for actual runspaces).  This works, but I found the performance hit completely negates the purpose of these scripts - performance : )

This is probably pretty elementary to this crowd- I'm new to powershell as a scripting language.  The other scripts I found for accomplishing this task were way too verbose IMHO.  

This script just takes the output of a DSQuery command and passes it to DSMOD and DSMOVE.  The items moved programmatically are labelled and time stamped.  A total of the newly disabled items and the duration of the task are calculated, then this info is emailed.  

Without these lines or comments, this script could be reduced by about 90% and still have the same effect.

1375653416.0,15,self.PowerShell,1jpaff,Using PowerShell to Monitor TCP/IP Socket Use.,jawapima,17,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1jpaff/using_powershell_to_monitor_tcpip_socket_use/,"I was asked to monitor the number of sockets a CRM installation was creating on a Windows 2008 R2 box. There were some custom applications on the machine not properly closing sockets that had been created. It seems the CRM machine was calling a local webservice to help sanitize leads that were being injected into the system, and do other custom actions when users were executing various functions while in CRM.


The event log was reporting the TCP/IP subsystem had run out of available sockets periodically.  After doing some research, it seems Microsoft has increased the dynamic client port range for outgoing connections in Windows Vista and in Windows Server 2008 and later. The new default start port is 49152, and the default end port is 65535. This is a change from the configuration of earlier versions of Windows that used a default port range of 1025 through 5000.

I was interested in seeing exactly how many connections were being left open by this custom code. Using netsh gave me the answer; 


    PS C:\&gt; netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport tcp
    Protocol tcp Dynamic Port Range
    Start Port      : 49152
    Number of Ports : 16384

    
So it appears this code is exhausting over 16,000 ephemeral ports at certain times. Going through the event logs confirmed this behavior. It is possible to up the number of ports through the registry, or by using netsh to set the dynamic ports (editing the same registry key); 


    HKEY\LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters 


But that seems sloppy at best. If the code is using up this many sockets, it's obvious the code is the issue. To prove that, I needed to receive notifications whenever the socket pool was exhausted, and then could take that to the development team, to have their code sanitized further to make sure all the connections that were being opened, were subsequently closed when no longer needed. 


I came up with this simple powershell script to run through a scheduled task every 10 minutes to check netstat -aonp ""TIME_WAIT"", and ""CLOSE_WAIT""  connections. If it's over the threshold specified, it will dump a simple alert to the users specified.

        $timeWaitCount = $timeWait.Count
        $closeWait = netstat -aonp TCP | Select-String ""CLOSE_WAIT""
        $closeWaitCount = $closeWait.Count

In virtually every instance where I'd use Write-Host it turns out that Write-Verbose or Write-Warning is a superior choice.

&gt;Whenever a PowerShell script asks for credentials, PowerShell pops up a dialog box. You can view this by running this command:
&gt;
    Get-Credential
&gt;
&gt;PowerShell is a console-based scripting language, and so it may be unwanted to open additional dialogs. That's why you can change the basic behavior and ask PowerShell to accept credential information right inside the console. This is a per-machine setting, so you need local Administrator privileges and must run these two lines from an elevated PowerShell console:
&gt;
    $key = ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds""

`PS C:\tmp\&gt; gc .\file.txt | Foreach-Object {$_ -replace '(FOO)(BAR)','$1-$2'} | Set-Content .\file2.txt`

What this does is use regular expressions to find and replace text in a file. Specifically, using backreferences to add a hyphen between FOO and BAR, then output it to a new file. I admit there are probably much better ways to this, but since it took about a year and a half to learn regular expressions and I've used them about 8 times since then, this is how I did it and it worked. FWIW, this was the final command that I used:

`PS C:\tmp\t&gt; gc .\file.txt | Foreach-Object {$_ -replace '([A-Z]{2}\-[0-9]{3})([A-Z]{1,2}\-[0-9]{1,3}).*','$1-$2'} | Set-Content .\file-clean.txt`

The intended outcome was to turn something like `AB-123CD-45 Some other text` into `AB-123-CD-45` and strip off the end so that I can drop a csv into excel and have four separate columns, using the hyphens as the delimiter.

I've written and released an application called [NoCloud Office](www.nocloudleftbehind.com). Developed with Office 365 administrators in mind, it manages a lot of functions you probably find yourself using on a regular basis for your clients. On top of that, you have the ability to create dynamic scripts that changed based on what you've selected (users, variables, etc). 

I've been using this internally for months and have finally set it up for people to subscribe and create their own accounts to try it out and use. Here are some of the reasons why I think it's a good fit for a lot of people:

* Allows for quick access to clients and the ability to authenticate to their accounts and run scripts against their users. This eliminates the need for multiple scripts and allows you to create single scripts based on variables. One variable, for example, is predefined and changes based on user selection. It can also run scripts against multiple clients.
* Has a suite of simple tools that are the bulk of what we as admins probably do for our clients. This includes password reset, permission changes, forwarding, etc. More to come!
* No worries about security and where your stuff is hosted. I run a database for authenticating to your account with NoCloud and it doesn't store any kind of sensivtive information like 365 credentials. I set out to create a tool, not a platform. It really doesn't need to be any more complex than that.
* Simple pricing. The whole per-client thing never made much sense to me. It's just $45.00 / month for an account and you can add as many clients, script, etc as you want.

Does this sound like something anybody would be interested in? If so, please feel free to checkout my site. If you do end trying it out, please message me and I'll send some scripts to try your way. Feel free to comment with suggestions, too! Again, I've only been using this internally so I'm open to anyone's thoughts.

Also, you may notice that download speeds are pretty slow. I'm hosted through my web host right now for a few days until I move to Amazon, so bare with me. :)

EDIT: I'm also able to give out trial keys. PM me and I'll get one to you.

Thanks!

Some backstory first though:  I'm a consultant and one thing I do for most clients is a Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer scan of some target machines to see which patches are approved in WSUS and make sure no important ones are missing.  Inevitably, I'm asked when I present my findings ""What are all of these KB's for?!?!"".  So I wrote this little guy to automate the task.

It just grabs the output from MBSA, which is a CSV that has the KB # in it, with no descriptions or even a name to say what the patch is for.  All my script does is control an invisible IE in the background and grab the title bar text, and dump that in column in my CSV.

Inevitably one of them is missing something, so a bit of massaging the output is needed, but it has saved me googling 200 patches more times than I can count.

    $ie = new-object -com ""InternetExplorer.Application""
    $i=$null
    $entries = (Import-Csv 'F:\Consulting Tools\MBSA\Found_desktop_installed_patches.csv').Count

    $values = Import-Csv 'F:\Consulting Tools\MBSA\Found_desktop_installed_patches.csv' |  
    % { $i++;
    Write-host ""$i out of $entries""
     if ($_.Description.Length -le 2){ 
        
        $kbNo = $_.ServicePackInEffect.Replace(""KB"","""")
        $ie.navigate(""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/$kbNo"")
        while($ie.busy) {Write-host ""Loading..."";start-sleep -Milliseconds 25}
        

        $_.Description = $ie.LocationName
        write-host $_.Description

1368638061.0,11,self.PowerShell,1ee5tg,Automating Windows OS patch installs on F5 pooled web servers intelligently and safely,BattleChicken,11,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1ee5tg/automating_windows_os_patch_installs_on_f5_pooled/,"I've been kicking around the idea of automating my windows patch installations for some of the easier servers in my org for some time now.  I'm going to finally do it starting with F5-pooled web servers and thought it would be a good idea to get some input from the community - in the event anyone has done this, someone already created the wheel and I'm duplicating effort (IE, use X program to do what you're looking at), or if there are some gotchas I'm not considering where I can benefit from your experience.

The environment with the systems is all VMware VMs.  

Each group of servers is a group of 3 in a F5 pool.  At any time, i need 2 of 3 servers online for the group to be considered 'up' and to ensure enough capacity for odd surges in traffic. and when I mark a system down in the pool to patch it I need to wait until all the persistent connections close so I can't just start patching immediately when I mark it down.  

Then, I patch, reboot, wait until the system is stable (low CPU utilization is the easiest indicator), then mark it back up in the pool... then wait for the F5 to ramp up connections to the system, then begin the process again with node 2 of 3.

I should be able to do all of that using the icontrol snapins (F5 tools) and MAYBE the powercli snapins (Vmware tools).. but i'm pretty sure I can do all of it with stock cmdlets and the icontrol tools.

The rough flow I see in pseudocode is:

1)  Read in in a list of pools and/or server names from  a file.

2)  for each line in the file, check the F5 pool to confirm all nodes are marked up.  If they are marked up, mark down the first server of the 3.

3)  After the mark-down, confirm the other two are still up.  keep an eye on the active connections to IIS (not sure how to do that one yet.. but wmi should have something)

4)  When the connections are under a thresshold, patch the servers.  On patch completion, reboot.

5)  Watch the system stop responding to pings, then start again.

6)  keep an eye on the CPU usage on the system.  when the average usage over 4 or 5 minutes is within a certain threshold, mark system back up in pool

7)  Repeat for other systems in the 1st line.


I think that flow covers anything, but I'm not sure - I welcome any input into this undertaking.  Suggest cmdlets, third party tools, that I don't do it (with reasons)... anything.  I want to make sure if I do this I'm doing it correctly.  It doesn't have to be fast, it just has to be stable.


Edit 1:  It's looking like while there are options to install patches via windows update (which would use WSUS if configured) on local machines easily, but options to install on remote systems are somewhat limited.  I'm looking at the options but it seems like using psexec.exe (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx) and a copied Powershell or VBS script may be how I do the actual patch applications.  Still digging.  It looks like there are people who've done that part already so I'll probably try to leverage one of those.

Edit 2: I determined that I have to use a less-than-ideal method to enable/disable machines from the pool.  There's a homebrewed ""make it easy to mark stuff up and down so nobody needs accounts to the F5"" method I'll have to use that has me toggling flag files instead of just marking up or down...  It's actually easier to implement but it's not as portable as it would be if i just use the icontrol cmdlets.

Also, the method I spent a bunch of time with today isn't working properly;  it could be how i'm loading it, or it could be it just doesn't work.. I've got another set I'll be trying tomorrow (time permitting)

Edit 3:  I finally got a chance to do some more playing and for actual windows patches, I don't think anything can beat what Levon Becker has written:  http://www.bonusbits.com/main/PSModule:WindowsPatching

I haven't had a ton of time to dig into it yet but I've looked over 25% of the code and have had a successful test so far and these seem really well put together.

I am not allowed to install new software on this server, because it is super mission critical to the company. As such, I'm limited to built in tools on Windows Server 2008R2.

Robocopy in all it's single threaded glory is too slow to be useful, so I hacked this together to call multiple copies of robocopy on subfolders with the data in it. Essentially it ingests a list of files, that are text files with a list of subfolders in them (too many folders at once will bring the server to it's knees). It then launches robocopy for each folder path, and waits until they all complete, then moves on to the next file.

But, it's ugly. I'm relatively new to scripting in powershell and I know there must be a more efficient way of doing this. One big glaring issue is if a single instance of robocopy gets hung up, the script will loop forever waiting for it.

Can anyone offer up any tips, tricks, or other ways of doing this? (or if you just want to make fun of the newb, that's OK too)

   I'm back with another hopefully interesting project.  I'd like to make a script that copies out all of the attachments from a user's Outlook Profile and stores them in a path I specify.  

   Here is the kicker, I need to somehow try and keep the folder structure the user had in their documents, so this makes sense to them.

   Why?  We're migrating from Exchange 2003 to 2010 and are migrating all of the user's PST's to our central store, but don't have the space to keep ten years worth of attachments.  We've been preaching that ""Outlook is not a file-storage system!"" for years, but have no buy-in from management to do any enforcement.

   So, I have this script I found online and have been tweaking.  The problem is that I can't seem to figure out a good way to mimic their Outlook folder structure.

   Ideally, this would create a directory structure like this:

    Inbox:
         Accounting Timesheets (has XLS documents)
         Time-off Approval PDFS  (full of PDF's)
         Fantasy Football Team    (Has more XLS)

   Such that the folder structure is similar to what they would've seen in Outlook.  

  This is what I've got so far:

    $outlook = new-object -com Outlook.Application 
    $inbox = $outlook.Session.GetDefaultFolder(6) 
    foreach ($group in $inbox.items |% {$_.attachments} | group     filename) { 
    trap { 
    Write-Host There was a problem saving $fName 
    Continue 
    } 
    $fName = ""C:\Powershell\Temp\$($group.Name)"" 
    $group.Group[0].saveasfile($fName) 
    if ($?) {Write-Host $fName was saved succesfuly.} 
    } 


EDIT: Hey guys, I've completed the script.  The user's Outlook must be closed for this to work.  

I've tested it and so far, so good, it will dump the contents of a user's PST to a specified folder.  It is ugly now, but works.  Later I'll parameterize it.

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6268163/Save%20Attachments%20from%20PST.ps1

**Edit again: Well, turns out I was accidentally getting items form the Inbox, not the PST, I've tweaked it further but it still doesn't work.**  The problem is getting the $.Items.attachments from the archive to work the way it works with $.Inbox.Items.Attachments

The naming convention is something similar to ""department.machinetype"". So for example, a sales laptop would be named ""slslpt"", a marketing desktop would be named ""mrktdsk"". Apple machines are also need to be considered, as they are placed in their own OU's.

Moving the machines from staged to the proper OU was a necessity for group policy processing to function correctly. We additionally had a requirement to add any newly provisioned laptops to the AD group responsible for allowing our certificate services to hand out certificates to any client needing access to our DirectAccess solution. 

I decided to write a script that will place the machines in the proper OU, and if it's a laptop, add it to the proper security group for the certificate services to process. I initially did all of this using if/ifelse/else, but found it too cumbersome. (I have many more machine names and locations to deal with than are listed here, and it ended up being over 50 lines of processing just for machines). I re-wrote it using switch statements, which I've found are far superior!

Switch is awesome.

There's the link to the thread.  I'm a complete noob to powershell, so please be prepared for some stupidity.  I have been trying to get a better grasp of networking as I build my web dev skills, and this has caused me to venture into the realm where linux and windows meet in what appears to be some strange middle ground where they both appear to speak almost the same language, but definitely not even close.


Here is where I am confused. I can open up a cmd and ssh into a linux server without a problem (using PuTTY, plink, etc.), but when I try to do the same thing with powershell, failure ensues.  I know there's a difference between the two, where one is a scripting language and the other is....   just a console? 


I can run cmd from within a powershell instance and I can run powershell from within the prompt, but I cannot run certain cmd commands from powershell without invoking a cmd instance, and this is causing me some confusion as well.



I'm trying to make it so that I have just one interface where I can run all of my commands, whether they be from the command prompt, powershell, or any unix shell like bash or what have you. 

Then there's Powershell ISE which I thought was perfect. Especially in Windows 8, where dummies like me can see all of the commandlets right there without having to consult Microsoft's online reference, and auto completion, just like my favorite text editors.


But this thing still won't ssh me to my Unix server, which I can currently invoke through Window's console or even Cygwin using PuTTY.  


Is this because PuTTY and Cygwin are just using cmd commands and Powershell is not compatible, or am I just missing the point completely, and Powershell will only work for Windows networking completely?

Here's the info I'm collecting thus far:

* Basics: OS, CPU, RAM, Disk Space, etc.
* Current Users
* Events from Application, Security and System event logs
* File shares and open files
* [Netstat -ano results parsed and resolved](http://ramblingcookiemonster.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/get-networkstatistics/)

* Recent reboots
* Services
* Services set to autostart and not running

Info I'm considering collecting:

Basically I'm working as a scheduler for a tech support contractor for a major municipal power company. For the past few days I've been shadowing the head scheduler and watching her work. A lot of the job involves entering the same data repeatedly into two different and (for the most part) redundant databases, as well as writing emails to clients/techs.

My new boss asked me how I was getting along and what I thought about the work. I told him that I could think of a couple of different ways to streamline the process, and to start I already had an idea for a simple VB or AutoHotKey GUI script. I figured that rather than manually entering the same data in several different ways I would set up a simple form to collect vital data ($TECH_LAST_NAME, $TECH_FIRST_NAME, $CLIENT_LAST_NAME, $CLIENT_FIRST_NAME, $APPT_TIME, $APPT_DATE, $ASSET_ID, $LOCATION, etc) and then set buttons next to the fields that would correspond to the many different versions of this info needed and copy said info to the clipboard, as well generate notification emails and the like. Functionally rather than selecting, copying, and rearranging this data several times over I could gather it in a little window and click to copy what I need and paste from there.

He surprised me however and said that while that sounds like a good idea, he wants it in a Powershell script. He said that since it's my job and my personal project it's up to me of course, but he said that he wants someone in the office with the capability of scripting in Powershell and that it could go a long way in showing my motivation to advance. 

This seems like a nice opportunity, but I find it a little baffling at the same time because I'm not sure Powershell would be the best tool for this, or even that it would be a demonstrable exercise in showing my Powershell capabilities (if I had any). With a little hunting I've found Admin Scripting Environment and I'm going to brush up on a llittle Powershell syntax, but I figured I'd check out this sub and see what you guys think. Any advice would be much appreciated.

This database also needs to be relational to their user account. Lucky for us, Active Directory Domain Services has a specific attribute for storing user images. This attribute is called the thumbnailPhoto attribute. The thumbnailPhoto attribute has been around in ADDS since 2000, but it is just now finally being used throughout applications. Some applications of note are Outlook (&gt;2010), Lync, and Sharepoint. The one caveat of this attribute though, it is a byte field; meaning that you cannot just upload an image and call it good (although there are other utilities that allow for this). Again we are lucky, thanks to the proliferation of PowerShell, converting files to their byte format is very simple. Also, I am keeping the system of jpg &gt; byte &gt; jpg for continuity's sake; although theoretically you could convert the images mid-stream. 

Here is the main outline of how this process looks:

1. Crop image to a square layout

2. Resize/Compress image to be less than 100 KB

3. Convert the image to a byte form

4. Set the user’s thumbnailPhoto attribute to byte form of the image

5. Have a user GPO that executes a PowerShell script at logon

6. The PowerShell script retrieves the thumbnailPhoto attribute data and saves the data as an image file
   * Then the PowerShell script calls an executable where it passes the image in

7. User’s image is set

**Steps 1-3 should be processed by a script. I haven't written one for that though.**

**Step 4 as well should be handled by a script. The below can give you an idea where to start.**

    Import-Module ActiveDirectory
    $photo = [byte[]](gc \\path\to\edited\photos\user1.jpg -Encoding Byte)
    Set-ADUser user1 –Replace @{thumbnailPhoto=$photo}

**Step 5 you will want to create a new GPO. I setup one computer policy and one user preference to accomplish this.**

    Computer Configuration =&gt; Preferences =&gt; Windows Settings =&gt; Files =&gt; New File
    	Action: Replace
    Source File: \\domain.com\netlogon\domainLogo.bmp
    Destination File: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\User Account Pictures\user.bmp
    User Configuration =&gt; Policies =&gt; Windows Settings =&gt; Scripts =&gt; Logon =&gt; Add
    	Name: \\domain.com\netlogon\executeUserTile.ps1

**Step 6 below is the code to accomplish the actual picture creation and application.**

    # Executes PowerShell in STA (Single Threaded Apartment) Mode and then executes the actual script.
    powershell -sta \\domain.com\NETLOGON\userTile.ps1

With that in mind, what I'd love to automate would be a way to compare local profiles (on XP machines) to valid user accounts on the domain. If 1) the domain account does not exist and 2) the profile is not for a local PC account I'd like to have it delete the profile on the machine. 

Ideally, I'd like to run this against the entire domain, but I'd be almost as happy if I can execute it on individual computers as needed.  We have a lot of turnover in employees and each person can work on half a dozen different computers, so we eventually have hundreds of 'orphaned' profile caches just sitting there taking up space. 

Any tips for how to approach this would be appreciated.  

Edit: Deleting huge chunks of files across the entire domain frightens me a bit... so even if I just get it to report back to me which orphaned profiles exist, it would be a huge step forward for me.

1334277550.0,8,self.PowerShell,s74rf,Avoiding GUI lockup when running a command (e.g. a ping that fails),Plonqor,9,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/s74rf/avoiding_gui_lockup_when_running_a_command_eg_a/,"So I've been writing a sort of dashboard GUI in PS, and one of the problems I came across was that when I wanted to run a ping, it would lock up the GUI until it finished. This is most noticeable when the ping fails, as it waits to timeout. Here I will explain my solution.

The basic concept is to create a background job, then use a timer to check if that job is done (at an interval, e.g. 200ms), and if it is done, retrieve the result.

**Note:** I'm assuming you already have the code to create the GUI using Windows Forms

Step 1. Create the timer:

    $tmrPingResult = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Timer
    $tmrPingResult.Interval = 200 #Interval in milliseconds
    $tmrPingResult.add_Tick($tmrPingResult_Tick)

Step 2. The ping code (or anything else that causes the same lockup):

    Function PingComputer {
        #Start the ping job using -quiet to suppress output
        $j = Start-Job -InputObject $CurrentComputer {
                Test-Connection $input -Count 1 -Quiet
        }

        #The following allows the PingJob variable to be accessed by the whole script
        Set-Variable -Name PingJob -Scope script -Value $j 

        #Enable the timer to check for results
        $tmrPingResult.Enabled = $True
    }

Step 3. The timer code (runs on each tick):

**Note:** you could put this straight into *$tmrPingResult.add_Tick()* in step 1, but this is how my script is set up

    $tmrPingResult_Tick = {
        #Checks if job has completed
        IF ($PingJob.State -eq 'Completed') {
            $tmrPingResult.Enabled = $False #Disables the timer

            #Checks if ping was successful
            IF (Receive-Job -Job $PingJob) { #Ping successful
                ### PING SUCCESS CODE HERE ###
            }
            ELSE { #Ping failed
                ### PING FAILED CODE HERE ###
            }
            #Remove the job
            Remove-Job $PingJob
        }
    }

And that's it! Just running the function (in this case PingComputer) will start off the timer which will check for the result and run code based on it. This solution can of course be adopted for any other command that locks up the GUI, not just a ping.

Hope this helps a fellow PoSHer!",,False,,t5_2qo1o,True,,,True,t3_s74rf,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/s74rf/avoiding_gui_lockup_when_running_a_command_eg_a/,

   Seeing some posts like this one on [getting web Content with Powershell](http://waynes-world-it.blogspot.com/2008/05/reading-web-content-with-powershell.html) made me wonder if there is a way I could make a script to browse various subreddits safely from Powershell.

Now, before you make a request, you have to set a ""metadata"" object to the request, so it can do whatever magic it needs later for version compatibility.

So I create the object, and try to assign it like the example code shows, but I'm getting a bizarre error

**Exception setting ""metadata"": ""Cannot convert the ""RequestMetadata"" value of type ""RequestMetadata"" to type ""RequestMetadata"".""**

Any idea what could be going on there?  I can't imagine what the error is trying to tell me since that looks like the same type to me.  Am I just blind?

BTW, here's the test harness I'm using to get rolling if that helps make any sense 

     $service= New-WebServiceProxy -uri ""https://$myserver/enterprise/admin/ws?wsdl""
     $util= New-WebServiceProxy -uri ""https://$myserver/enterprise/admin/util/ws?wsdl""

     $Metadata = new-object RequestMetadata

     $Metadata.organizationUid = ""0"";
     $Metadata.locale = ""en_US"";

     $request = new-object GetEncodedUsernameRequest;
     $request.metadata = $Metadata;
*this assignment is what causes the error*

Any clue what that error message in bold could mean?  

-

EDIT: Never mind... solved the problem.  (though I still have no idea what the underlying error is telling me)

EDIT2: Don't ya hate that?

I actually had 2 problems... the first was that originally tried using a much [more complicated chunk of code that didn't work quite right](http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2007/02/28/calling-a-webservice-from-powershell/), before switching to this style.  The types were still loaded from that one, so it didn't error out on the redefinitions.  (That error is the reason I switched styles originally, and I should have started fresh in a new session)

The second was that I wasn't setting up a name space usefully.  Changing some of the lines to the following got rid of errors


    $service= New-WebServiceProxy -uri ""https://besnva.office.aol.com/enterprise/admin/ws?wsdl"" -Namespace BESAdmin
    $util= New-WebServiceProxy -uri ""https://besnva.office.aol.com/enterprise/admin/util/ws?wsdl"" -Namespace BESUtil

I've got a pretty big analysis to run on multiple DNS zones.  

First step for me would be to get all the DNS Records of the ""old"" zone and to be able to extract their Recordname / RecordType / RecordData, then checking if it Resolves, to which IP address.  
  
So I'm stuck at the very first part already, getting all records of the zone.  
I tried using the DNS-Shell Commandlets.  

    Get-ADDnsPartition -server serverOLD | Get-ADDnsZone zoneOLD | where-object {$_.zonetype -eq ""Primary"" } | Get-ADDnsR
    ecord | where-object {$_.recordtype -eq ""CNAME"" } | sort

I keep getting the invalid namespace error. In PowerGUI, I set a break point on line 6, so I can see that the $_.Computer variable is accurately being populated. I did get-member on the $_.Computer variable, and see that it is a string. If I run the command on line 6 w/ the name of the server, it goes through fine, but if I populate a new variable from the same $_.Computer variable, I get the same error, if I were to do something like, $test = 'server_name', it works with $test.

The main issue I am trying to solve is having a report on all my scripts that will not overwhelm my inbox.  Currently I have a lot of scripts setup waiting for input and without checking I have no idea if they are running or not, unless they succeed or fail reading an input file. So I made some functions that can be added to scripts that will have them output a .csv file (turns out might have been a bad choice because of no -append parameter, but I digress.).
  

Another script will read this file/archive the old log and send an email with the contents of the log file.  The way I set my script up it is expecting a Report folder where current.csv will reside, and under that folder one called ""Archive"" where archive.csv will reside.  You can keep my defaults or edit those parts of the scripts.

I was primarily interested in getting the failover history for cluster nodes. So I wrote a function that will use three parameters, a server name, and two numbers, the after day, in numbers, as in 14, if you wanted events after 14 days ago, and a before day, as in before 1 day ago. If no day parameters are entered it will assume 14 days for the after and 0 for the before. Additionally, it has a check for the OS, since it can only pull the data from Server 2008 (if you have 2012 in your environment, you will need to make modifications). It will also check to make sure the server is a cluster. The function will also get the names of all the nodes in a cluster and before proceeding to get the failover history.

I posted the [function](https://github.com/Polonius19/PoSH/blob/master/func_getfailoverhistory.ps1) to GitHub. It relies on another function, a module really, that gets the OS version. I've also [posted](https://github.com/Polonius19/PoSH/blob/master/mod-osversion.ps1) it to GitHub as well.

A couple of caveats. The regex I used to pull the node names matches our naming convention. You'll need to modify to match your own. Also, this doesn't seem to work on XP systems. I wrote this for our NOC, but they have only XP workstations. So I don't know that they can't use it because they can't install PoSH v3 or if the problem is XP.

I'm looking for the fastest way to distribute file(s) or folders to approx 5000 windows 7 devices.  I'm essentially looking how to mimic the functionality of Windows Server DFS but for windows 7 devices. Tinkered with SCCM but it uses BITS and isn't fast enough.  So now i'm wondering if powershell is up to the task.  

So two parts: Anyone have any luck with not only a multithreaded file copy with jobs but also creating a single powershell script that is distributed amongst many servers that will partition the request and execute a task?

I'm thinking of a central powershell script that partitions the work writes to the slave servers that actually do the task with their subset of machines (avoiding double hop credential issues).  

Or would it just be easier to just use PS jobs and instantiate thousands of Robocopy instances?  

*EDIT
Thanks for your suggestions, and it appears you all have solved the problem using the standard platform tooling.

I guess I should give some background, these are all kiosk devices with possible slow/non-reliable circuits and some devices. So that's why sometimes these tools underperfom.  These are all critical devices and in a pinch I was looking for on-demand parallel execution of file transfer that could happen within 10 minutes to all devices for a file under 1 mb.

Your suggestions are solid with SCCM, GPO, DFS but wondering if there was a faster way with more distribution and parallelism using powershell.  It seems that powershell would be a perfect option for it's flexibility to handle varying distribution needs.

      484 4611 {System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntry, System.Diagnostics.EventLogEnt...

So what I ended up doing is breaking out the first entry of each group and 
displaying its first line.

    $logSource = 'Security'
    Get-EventLog $logSource | 
        group InstanceId | 
        % { 
            $count = $_.count
            $_.group[0] | 
                select `
                    InstanceID, `
                    @{name='Count'; exp={$count}}, `
                    @{name='Message'; exp={($_.Message -split ""`n"")[0]}}
        } | 
        sort InstanceId | 
        ft -auto

(If you want to look at a log other than the security log, change the logSource
variable in the first line.)

Some example results:

1366896405.0,8,self.PowerShell,1d2x8j,Converting an IP Address into an integer using HEX,Soul_Retriever,10,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1d2x8j/converting_an_ip_address_into_an_integer_using_hex/,"I need to create a function that will turn an IP address into an integer. (it's weird I know)

I have a function that converts from integer to IP address. This works fine.

An example of this would be:

*First value received: -567235574

*Convert it to hex: de30ac0a

*segment it into four: de 30 ac 0a

*convert each segment to decimal: 222 48 172 10

*The last segment is the first segment of the ip address so swap it all around and add a few periods for readability: 10.172.48.222



I need to do the reverse of this which would be:

*Remove formatting and segment: 10 172 48 222

*convert to hex: 0a ac 30 de

*swap it back around: de 30 ac 0a

*press it into one: de30ac0a

*convert to decimal: -567235574


The function I have made for this does not seem to work, when I try to convert a decimal number to hexadecimal it remains in decimal. I'm probably doing something wrong as I'm fairly new to PowerShell.

This is my function:

        function Compress-IPAddress
        {
        param([parameter(Position=0,Mandatory=$TRUE)][string]$IPAddress)
            if(!$IPAddress.Contains('.')) {Write-error -Message ""Not a valid IP Address"" -RecommendedAction ""please use periods to denote each section of the ip address""; Return}

            $splitIP = @($IPAddress.Split('.'))
            for($i = 0; $i -lt 4; $i++)
            {$splitIP[$i] = ""{0:x2}"" -f $SplitIP[$i]}
            $IPHEX = ""$($SplitIP[3])$($SplitIP[2])$($SplitIP[1])$($SplitIP[0])""
            $CompIP = [int](""0x$IPHEX"")
    
            Return $CompIP
        }

At the moment I get an error of :
&gt;Cannot convert value ""0x2224817210"" to type ""System.Int32"". Error: ""Value was either too large or too small for a UInt32.""""

I can see this is because the numbers haven't been converted to hex though I am unsure why. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.


For those interested, this is the other function (probably badly written too but it works):

        function Expand-IPAddress
        {
            Param([parameter(Position=0,Mandatory=$TRUE)][int]$Number)
            $ipHEX = [string]::Format(""{0:x}"",$Number)
            $SplitHEX = @()
            for($i = 0; $i -lt 4; $i++)
                {
                $SplitHEX = $SplitHEX + ""0x$($ipHEX.substring(($i*2),2))""
                Write-Verbose ""Segment $i: $($SplitHEX[$i])""
                }
            Return ""$([int]$SplitHEX[3]).$([int]$SplitHEX[2]).$([int]$SplitHEX[1]).$([int]$SplitHEX[0])""

In those scripts, I also automate providing the user their credentials by generating an email draft using Outlook.

For whatever reason,  the draft keeps having additional space at the end of every line, and when a user goes to copy/paste the credentials for the app, it copies the extra space.  This results in a number of emails from the users saying their credentials don't work.

I've tried a number of things, but I'm not able to figure out WHY it's adding the extra space so far.  I know for certain that the $variables I'm using do not have spaces since I'm logging in the script pretty heavily - it seems 100% related to either the outlook-portion of the script OR outlook is doing some jiggery itself.

I suspect it might have something to do with the multi-line string or the encoding of the message (i may see if i can figure out how to send as HTML/force plaintext later on), but I can't confirm either thing currently.

So far so good, I begin playing with a datetime object and notice method .ToFileTime() appears to output the correct the correct format.   Here is what I have tried so far.

SubStatus is an enumerated list whose values can be found here: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/get-bejob-substatus-and-other-properties (about halfway down).

This script will toggle between two MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe.config files and can be combined with task scheduler to automatically speed up mailbox moves at night, when server performance does not need to be as high, and then slow them down in the morning when users start to log on.  

Simply make a copy of the config file and name it MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe.config.alt and change the performance settings as desired, then run this script manually or via scheduled tasks.

Basically it suspends all queued requests, waits for active moves to finish, stops the MRE service, swaps the config files, starts the service, and queues the moves again.

More information on the config file can be found here:

I've worked out the primary Import-Counter commands I will need to use to get the data out, but am trying to parametrise this so that I can do it for each machine in the log file (without having to open the log up in Perfmon, which can take 15 minutes or sometimes more, and is the reason I'm writing this script), and find out what each hostname is.

The script I have does the job, but it still takes a minute to return the data I want, and I wondered if there was a simpler way to do this, as I'm not too familiar with Powershell?

Here's what I have:

    $counters = Import-Counter -Path $log_path$logfile -ListSet * | Select-Object paths -ExpandProperty paths

    $svrs = @()

    # for each line in the list of counters, extract the name of the server and    add it to the array

    # remove duplicates and sort the list of servers
    $sorted_svrs = $svrs | sort -unique

    foreach ($svr in $sorted_svrs) {
        Write-Host $svr
    }

I'm just printing the names for the moment, but they'll go into an array in the proper script, and then I'll run my Import-Counter block with each of these hosts parametrised in.

It seemd like I should either completely emulate browser behaviour while using WebClient or WebRequest - including cookies and UserAgent, or just figure our how to manipulate an instance of IE to download files.

Hence I wanted to program my own reports from scratch.

So I just develop my reports as SQL Stored Procedures and use a PS script to write nice Excel files and e-mail them to upper managers automatically. I tried to wrap things into a reusable library so that the actual reports obey the DRY principle. I would like to share it and also ask a question because something doesn't work.

What doesn't work is that when I run it manually it is fine but when automatically, as a task, it does not actually send the attachment.

Also I would appreciate every suggestion how to improve on this. Like not having the .bat file or more error-handling or something. Or is there are better PS reporting library already out?

Hope someone will find it useful and can also help me to make it better. Or to make the attachment actually work. Weird. When I run it manually it works.

I currently work part-time in a large corporation, in the quality control department.  My job requires me to upload an enormous amount of files (mostly .pdf and .jpeg) to a database-kind-of-thing. Now, each entry in the database may or may not have a file or a couple of files associated with it. I can either upload the documents manually, one by one, via a clunky web interface (Which isn't really an option when I have tens of thousands of files to upload), or zip them up and upload a bunch at once, but only if they follow this file name format - *reference number*_YYYY-MM-DD.*extension*

So this part is kind of simple, after a couple hours of googling I figured out how to automate the copying of a file and naming the copies accordingly. [Here's](http://pastebin.com/sM66b5du) what I've got so far. Now, there's only one little problem. Say I've a certificate of conformity that needs to be uploaded 500 times, for every colour of brand X paint (The whole system is kind of retarded like that). It's a 1MB pdf file. So I run my script, zip the output up, and upload the zip, right? WRONG. There's a 20MB filesize limit on uploaded zips. So, I could just zip the files into 20 MB chunks manually, but that's a shitload of work. So my question is this : how can I build on what I've already got and automate all the zipping? Ideally, the output should be as many &lt;20MB .zip files as necessary.

My work computer has no permissions whatsoever. It's running Powershell v1. I also have 7zip. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I don't actually have a use for it and have only done basic debugging so take it as is or improve if you want.  If you do improve on it please post back, would love to see some functional critiques or what other people do with it.

There are three functions in this script, one that isn't even used but might be useful in the future.

The main function Query-FileOnComp takes the dns name of a computer and a local path.  It will return an object containing name/path/fileexist properties.  If an optional parameter of -UNCtoCopy is populated it will copy that file to the computer.

This relys on a function Convert-LocaltoUNCPath, which takes a DNS name and local path and will convert it into a UNC.

There is also a function Convert-UNCtoLocalPath which takes one parameter of a UNC and converts it to a local path.

The error trapping could be much more robust, but other than that has a few salvageable parts, all you can ask for 2 hours of lazy friday work.

Fortunately it’s a tiny part of my job. 

I’ve recently inherited a bunch of scripts used in setting up our test environment domain controller. After creating the server we run this script to set up active directory, create 6 default users and set up SQL. 
I was just given the task  of modifying the script to also set the 6 domain accounts to have the passwords never expire. Unfortunately I cannot use the Quest cmdlets, or any other due to the insane approval and testing process mandated here. It would take too long to get through approval at this point in the project. 
So I keep trying to use ADSI methods I have found all over the net to no avail. I’m missing something as I constantly end up with it bombing and the change not happening to the accounts. 

I have tried inserting this in the function that creates the accounts and it dies on all 6 accounts
$objworker.userflags = 65536 -bor 64
$objworker.SetInfo()

I also tried, at the end of the script, to insert this to just change one account, and it fails too
$user = [ADSI]""LDAP://TestUser""
$currentUAC = [int]($user.userAccountControl.ToString())
$newUAC =  $currentUAC -bor 65536
$user.put(""userAccountControl"",$newUAC)
$user.SetInfo()

I would be fine with inserting a line at the end of the script for each account, if I knew how. Ideally I would like to add a line to the function that creates them so it would happen for all 6, but at this point I just need it to work. Unfortunately I told my boss it would be pretty simple to have the accounts we already created never expire, before I realized I didn't know how to do it without using the Quest AD cmdlet  ",,False,,t5_2qo1o,False,,,True,t3_ii849,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/ii849/inherited_a_powershell_task_longtime_sysadmin_but/,

Currently this is the code I have:
     import-module activedirectory

     # gets the date of 60 days ago
     $setdate = (get-date).adddays(-60)

     #gets the users from the Awaiting Deletion OU in Active Directory that are older than 60 days old. Lists the users account name

I can pipe it into a file using out-file and it looks normal to me. But when I try to call it using $userlist[5] I can an error.

Luckily enough all of the email addresses of these users reflect the desired logon/UPN. So if I can search or query active directory for users whose email address differs from their UPN I can get a list of who needs to be changed.

I am attempting to do a powershell search as such...

**Get-ADUser -f {UserPrincipalName -ne 'EmailAddress'}**

Obviously that doesn't work. It was my first attempt. That just searches for users whose email doesn't equal that value. And that's where I got stuck.

But, you don't want to have to enter this set of creds every time.

Write the creds to a text file, amirite? Just kidding.

I've spent some spare time dabling in a few POC how to approach this, and sadly yes you'll have to write creds to disk at some point.

So, I'd appreciate any thoughts. If this is one of those ""give up now lest"" situations, that's an acceptable answer too.

####Method 1: .NET
----
[pastebin](http://pastebin.com/M17uVBzT)

This will take a list of computers with FQDN and try to gather credentials for each individual domain (e.g. ""FOO.CORP.LOCAL, BAR.BAZ-CORP.COM, FOO"" etc). It then tries to encrypt and export the credentials into an xml file that can be re-imported later and decrypted using the master password.

I had seen a lot of examples that used the simple rijndael provider, but my network has FIPS encryption enabled which will not allow this type of encryption. 

My main concern with this is I don't have enough experience with using these crypo providers, and there could easily be all manner of mistakes.

I'm not looking for somebody to write it, but maybe just somebody to point me in the direction of something that is similar.

---------------

**The environment:**

* Multiple Server 2008
* Failover Clustering
* Many-person administration
* Running the script on a server that isn't one of the failover nodes
* 100 Resources spread out across 1 cluster, 4 nodes, with about 20 groups.
* About 50% of the resources are java.exe...

**The problem:**

My coding team doesn't have the time to fix a problem with their code. When failover manager fails over (or even gracefully turns off) the java.exe's they don't always turn off. Leaving us to find and kill erroneous javas.

**What I'd like to do:**

Get a list of the PIDs for all the JAVA.exe's on each node of the cluster. Then look on each node/server for any JAVA.exe's that aren't on that list and terminate the process.

It seems so simple. I don't know why I've been having so much trouble. I am generally just a script-kiddy, googling something similar and adjusting it to fit my own needs, but this is something a bit too specialized I guess. I could PROBABLY do it with a batch file, but our group and resource names are pretty dynamic and I'd hate to make something that breaks when somebody puts a space in a group name or something.

While I haven't done the looping part to go through each event or each ID, I thought I'd post the solution to the first problem I ran in to: identifying lines from the event message.

I figured Get-WinEvent might be smart enough to go through the message of an event and make each value into a property, but no. The message ends up being counted as a string, I can't even loop through each line of it because the whole thing counts as one single line.

So, the solution:

    $text = ""#text""
    $event = get-winevent -filterhashtable @{logname='security'; id=4624} -maxevents 1
    [xml]$eventmessage = $event.ToXML()
    foreach ($line in $eventmessage.Event.EventData.Data) {
        $event | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name $line.name -Value $line.$text
    }
    $event | select -Property TimeCreated,LogonType,TargetUserName,TargetDomainName,IpAddress,ID

At first I did an ""if ($line.name -eq ""Logon Type:"")"" evaluation to it for each value I wanted to collect, but then I figured why not just assign a property for every single line? Maybe someone will want to use a property that I'm not interested in.

The problem I found when putting the message into xml, is that one of the property names ends up being #text. Since I couldn't call $line.#text without an error, I stored ""#text"" as the variable $text.

Does this mean they are copying the files to be compressed into another directory and specifying the directory as the parameter to the NameSpace method instead of the file to be compressed?

&gt;Of course, this function will last only as long as your current Windows PowerShell session. If you’d like multiplynumbers to be a permanent addition to Windows PowerShell then add the function to your Windows PowerShell profile. To do that, type notepad $profile to bring up your default profile, **add the function call**, and then save the profile.

I'm running a groupwise &gt; exchange migration at a Law Firm which has fairly granular mailbox permission requirements.  The easiest way I can think to solve this is a script that would grant permissions to the Inbox and all subfolders via a script.

So what I need is a script that will take each users inbox then grant permission to a list of users, then recursively add these permissions to all subfolders in the inbox.

I know this sounds like permission inheritance should resolve it, however all the folders come in from groupwise and they may have dozens of folders that they need to give access to.  However we can't use 'full access' as they may have folders they need private.  So the idea is to train people to move all folders under their inbox that should be shared, and to keep any private folders out of their inbox.  My script would then grant access to those who need it.

I'm more than happy to write the script myself - I just need someone to point me in the direction of the commands I need to be using and how I acheive this, preferably with a couple of lines of pseudo-code.  I can flesh out the details myself.

I started my work with a goal:  To make my Robocopy scripts log data about their tasks to the Windows Event Viewer- this would expose the details of their activities to my event aggregation systems and allow me to alert on them, etc.  
  
So, to get started, you've got to first create a new Event Log to house your alerts.  I created one called ""Robocopy Scripts"".
To do that, run this command from an elevated command prompt:  
    New-EventLog -LogName ""Robocopy Scripts"" -Source Robocopy

This only has to be done once, so it won't be called in our script.  The script in the link above will take the exit code of Robocopy and apply a little (very little) logic to connect it to a predetermined human readable text containing information about the result of the task, and the duration(a particularly important consideration for a replication task).  It will output to the event log using the ""write-eventlog"" cmdlet.

I would appreciate your input or recommendations- the script runs well as is, but it sure seems like the ""elseif"" business is way inefficient.

(details inside),empty_message,7,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/iwulu/need_help_with_psobject_and_properties_i_think/,"Okay, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way, so any advice, pointers, or corrections are definitely appreciated. First a little background information.

I'm trying to store information gathered from an xml a file about network connections on servers. The info has to come from the xml file and not pulled directly from the systems. I have multiple servers, multiple network connections, and multiple properties for each connection that I need to store information for.

I started by creating an PSObject for each server and storing all the properties using Add-Member with the NoteProperty option like this.

    $objServer = new-object PSObject
    $objServer | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -name Name -Value $Cluster.fqdn
    $objServer | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -name UniqueID -Value $Cluster.UniqueID
    $objServer | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -name SiteName -Value $Location.Name.""#text""

I then used **foreach** to loop through each network interface on the server. Sometimes theres only 1 network interface, and sometimes it can be 6, 8, or even more. Here is the code I was trying to use to store the information about each network interface. My original idea was to create a PSObject to represent each network connection and add NotePropertys to store the information. I then tried to create an object to represent the network interfaces as a group and add each individual interface as a PropertySet. My plan was then to add the object representing the group of interfaces as a PropertySet of the original server object. Here is the code I was using.

    $i = 1
    $objNetInterfaces = new-object PSObject
    foreach ($NetInterface in $Cluster.Machines.Machine.NetInterface){
    $objNetInterface = new-object PSObject -Property @{
    ClusterUniqueID = $Cluster.UniqueID.ToString()
    InterfaceNumber = $NetInterface.InterfaceNumber.ToString()
    InterfaceSide = $NetInterface.InterfaceSide.ToString()
    IPAddress = $NetInterface.IPAddress.ToString()
    }
    $objNetInterfaces | Add-Member -type PropertySet -Name Instance$i -Value $objNetInterface
    $i++
    }

I know this is a mess. My hope was to be able to store the information so that it could be represented and accessed like this.

$Server.NetInterfaces.Interface1.IPAddress

Maybe I should be using hashtables or arrays. I tried arrays before, but like the idea of properties and subproperties because they can be accessed by name as shown above.

TL;DR: noob who wrote a script in an environment where UAC is autodisabled, how can I avoid permission issues when adjusting registry – and learn how to generalize my script even more? 

It’s kinda long so here’s the link: http://pastebin.com/Q0e8Uktp
MAIN QUESTION:
I’m a PowerShell nooblet who’s trying to make my coworkers lives easier by automating our post image setup (name, join domain, add local admin, and a few other things).  I was successful in achieving this but ran into a snag today when testing my script on a fresh installation of windows 7 where I forgot to disable UAC. UAC happens to be disabled per our GPO…don’t ask me why, I’m not sure if this is best practice or not. In any case the registry edits that are pretty crucial to the smooth functioning of the script get blocked when UAC is enabled and if I wanted to make my future scripts available to others who may have UAC enabled I feel like I should figure out how to fix this – even though it’s not an issue inside of my environment.
I’m not sure if you guys do general critiques in this sub, but as I’m trying to improve myself, any thoughts would be helpful too!  I also just started looking at other scripts today where .Synopsis .Description etc  are present and I realize that I didn’t do this and would like to refactor this script to match that format

What I am trying to do it run a script on my backup exec server, that will look at all the previous nights jobs, and ultimatly send info to a sharepoint list I have. I have a script that will give me the data I need in $variables. So, I can make $ServerName = the actual server name, and I can make $Runtime = the time each jobs runs for, etc.

WHere my problem comes in is that I then do this:
Enter-PSSession -computername sharepointserver.domain.com
Add-PSSnaping microsoft.sharepoint.powershell

That works great, I can now run commands as if I was in sharepoint server, such as get-spweb

Problem is, all the variables I set before I entered the remote session are no longer available. Those variables contain the text that I ultimately want in my sharepoint list.

So, question is, how do I pass variables that were set before I entered the remote session into the remote session so I can do what I need to do.

Seriously, this is a task and it sucks. It takes forever and there's no need for it. My co-workers can be chumps sometimes and are against scripting things for weird reasons.

I wrote the checks to see if updates are needed to be installed (parsing C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.log) and if the server needs a reboot due to Windows Update (there's actually a registry key for this).

So, now I want to change it to make it easier to run across my Orgs domain. It would be awesome if I could just stick with POSH remoting, but our developers suck and can code their way out of a paper bag, so Server03 will be around for the forseeable future.

I don't know how to present this code to a user of this. For right now, I'm just going to keep it a regular .ps1 script, but I want to change it so I can use it in a pipeline (like, get-updatestatus) and present the user with output that can be used as they fit.

Depending on the state of each switch, I am changing the way an LDAP filter is constructed.  Right now I have a three step If..Then..ElseIf type construct and I can't help feeling that I should really be able to force this into some type of switch statement.  While this is probably just me trying to be a perfectionist, it just strikes me as a better coding practice to use switches rather than cascading if..thens.  
The intended result is that is either switch exists to the exclusion of the other, the LDAP filter text for that objectCategory is included.  If both switches exist or both switches are missing, then the LDAP filter text performs an OR on both types.  
so at the moment, here is what I am doing: 

    if(($User -AND $Computer) -OR (-NOT $User -AND -NOT $Computer)){
        $TypeFilter = ""(|(objectCategory=person)(objectCategory=computer))""

The basic functionality behind it is that you give it a mail source and destination, and it will ""convert"" between the two. 

For example, you can specify an Outlook inbox as a source, and then some file system location as the destination to have the script take all the mail from the Inbox and write it out to the file system as .msg files (recreating the folder structure from the Inbox, of course). You can reverse the source and destination to have it save a folder full of .msg files back in the Inbox, too. Or the destination could be another mail folder in the profile, or even a .pst.

The script goes further when it outputs to the file system as .msgs. If you give it access to run LDAP queries, it will assign explicit permissions to each .msg to allow access to the file only to the sender and recipients of that particular message. It also has an option write the important data from each message to a SQL database (stuff like sender, recipients, subject, body, attachment names and sizes, and certain dates).

It is heavily based around the Outlook COM object model, so it requires Office 2007 or later to be installed.

As far as I know, I haven't found anything that will perform all the functionality, even in the commercial space. Initially, it started out as something simple to automate some trivial task, but it ballooned into this massive script spread across multiple modules totalling thousands of lines of code. At some point I began thinking it might be fun to convert it into a C# console application, which got me thinking if there might be any value in this for others.

What do you think? Could this be something that a lot of people might be interested in?

**Edit:** Since most of the interest seemed to be about exporting to .msg files, here's most of the module that was written to do that: [Extract-Mailstore](http://poshcode.org/4039)

I'm sure there is much better ways to do what I'm trying to accomplish. So I would like to avoid scripts until I get a solid understanding of how commands work outside of a script before I start scripting. So the basic goal is to look at a domain, get the number of computers in a domain and output only the count instead of all the extra info it comes with.

So far without making the command without a variable gives me:

    Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Server 'server.domain.org:3268' -SearchBase ""DC=childdomain,DC=domain,DC=ORG' | Measure-Object

    Count    : 260
    Average :
    Sum      :
    Maximum:
    Minimum :
    Property :

So I figured if I only want the line that has the count, I would let a variable = the command and then search the variable.

    PS C:\Users\gex&gt; $count= Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Server 'server.domain.org:3268' -SearchBase ""DC=childdomain,DC=domain,DC=ORG' | Measure-Object

    PS C:\Users\gex&gt; $count | Select-String -Pattern ""count""

This returns a blank (nothing) to the screen.

But when I actually think about it, the results of $count does not equal what is displayed above. Rather $count is holding the actual command as a string.

So I think what I need to figure out is how to get the results of the command into a variable. And then use:

    PS C:\Users\gex&gt; $count | Select-String -Pattern ""count""

to actually read the varible and display the line that says ""count"". Once I figure that out, then I can move into substrings and all that glorious stuff.

We have users with 50, 60, or 70GB mailboxes. Tens or hundreds of thousands of mail items in their inbox alone. It's absurd. We're moving towards implementing a quota policy from the mail server, but before we do that, sanity must be restored. We've got over 100 users with mailbox sizes over the soon-to-be quota.

What we're trying to teach users is to create multiple PST files (one for each year) and move files from their mailbox to the PST in manageable chunks of several thousand at a time. Ultimately, these PSTs will be copied up to a central network location for long-term backup. We document the process with pretty pictures ELI5 style, but 95% of our users don't follow up. They're too busy, it's too overwhelming, etc. They just want to give my team their passwords and let us do it for them which is a bad idea on several levels.

My organization currently has 6000 home directories that are saved across three different shares such as:

* \\\storage\home\
* \\\storage\home_2\
* \\\storage\home_3\

My co-workers and I have recently gone through and deleted 6000 invalid home directories. The next item on the list of things to do is bringing the remaining home folders into compliance with a new naming standard. Previously there was NO naming standard everyone just named the home directories what they wished, but as you can guess trying to track down folders for restores and other admin functions has gotten very time consuming. The new naming standard makes all home directories the same as the users username so ""firstname.lastname"". Has anyone run into a situation such as this?

I can do a bulk user update using a CSV file and the Set-QADUser command. But I have no idea where to start on writing a script that would look at a users current home directory and then rename that to the users username field.

    }

    Remove-Job $timed;

While I realize it seems silly to just return values, I'm using this as part of a timeout function, so just ignore that for the time being.

In this script, the code block stored in $input is either a stop-vm or start-vm command. I'm testing the success of that command, and it works fine -- I end up in the first part of the if statement if it's successful, and return 1; I end up in the else block if it fails, and return 0. In a failure case, I want to skip to the next item in my loop, and do so.

But there's another case I want to catch here, and that's a *warning* response. Stop-VM (or Start-VM) can return a warning indicating that the VM is already in the specified state, and in these cases I want to continue this item in my loop -- a VM being stopped already doesn't preclude the rest of the stuff I'm doing in this script.

Trouble is, a warning is evaluated as a failure in my logic, and I'm not sure how to fix that. I tried sending the output of Stop-VM -name $whatever to a variable, but the warning text doesn't actually end up in the variable. It doesn't end up in $error, either. If I could somehow *check* the warning text, I could just add an extra block in my if statement which would allow me to check the text the command fails with and return (but log) a success in the case of an ""already in the specified state"" warning.

Is there any way to catch the warning text? Or is there some way to check that I've gotten a warning, rather than an error?

I have successfully created other scheduled tasks on other servers in a similar manner so the fact that I can't figure this one out is extra frustrating.

The script that I have written uses the Cisco UCS Powertool module (CiscoUcsPS).

If I run the script manually myself it runs correctly.  If I run the script inside a session for the user the scheduled task runs as (using run as different user from the context menu) it runs successfully.

Running the scheduled tasks generates a System.Management.Automation.CommandNotFoundException from the calls to the cmdlets provided by the CiscoUcsPS module.

The script:

should be loaded.     I was doing this per attribute, but it seems somewhat inefficient  when dealing with several thousand users.  

I am now playing with a query of the current user and compare the incoming information.   If anything has changed,  I would just load the hashtable.
What I am not sure of is,  what is the most efficient way to compare a hashtable with an object?

I simply added a loop so it could run periodically, and then an if-else statement that searches the output .txt file for what I'm looking for.

Naturally, since I'm a bit new to powershell, I don't understand a lot of the syntax used by Jrich.  I just have a couple of questions that someone more well-versed may be able to answer:

1) Will this script disconnect and reconnect to the FTP server with each pass it makes through the loop?  If so, how can I make it stay connected through the duration of the script?  Or vice versa?

2) What does JRich mean when he says ""Allow data to buffer for a bit"" near the beginning of the main script?

[Script is here](http://pastebin.com/xMJvdvxV).

      -Permission ""FullControl"" `
      -DriveLetter ""E""

Assuming MyComputers.txt is a text file with a list of computers to change.  
Because I am an AD nut, I would probably just go with:

    $ds = New-object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher(""LDAP://OU=User Workstations,DC=Contoso,DC=com"")

      -DriveLetter ""E""

This must be run under an account which has admin access to the computers in question, and can access the admin share for the drive in question (\\computer\e$).  If there are a lot of files/folders on the drive, it may take as while as the inheritance flags are set.

I've run into a small problem which when the script reports into Excel it replaces the line before it.

I tried throwing $intRow = $intRow + 1 in after that line, it kinda worked but threw everything off kilter.

Also, my processor and physical memory queries do not return anything in Excel. Is this due to a syntax error or am i using something incorrectly?

I'm starting on the journey to learn powershell and I am pretty much at level 0. I've got this book ""Learn Powershell in a month of lunches"" which is pretty good so far.

I recently put together a storage report for my boss and I wanted to brainstorm some ways that powershell could be used to automate portions of my report. My requirement is pretty simple I think:

I want to query our AD domains: corp, corpdev, corptest, corpexternal, corpexternaltest for all member servers and DCs (optionally those which are VMs) and get a list of disk size AND disk size free space

Is this doable? Easily doable? One red flag that I see right away is the different credentials for those domains.

What features should I add?",BattleChicken,4,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1k8r3f/would_anyone_find_a_smart_file_delete_script/,"In the environment I'm working in right now, we deal with a lot of web server logs and without getting too into the details, we have identical logs on the web server, a ""hot"" location and a final resting place.  This results in the logs living in 3 different places, and necessitates purging the files older than X days from the web server and hot locations from time to time.  If the sometimes janky backup processes bomb, this Could theoretically result in purging files that haven't yet been backed up since the deletion method is outside of the backup method.   

So, I'm currently writing a smart-purge script that takes a source, destination, and number of days as parameters and checks each file on source older than X days.  If it exists on both source and destination, compares the modified date and sizes of the files.  If they are identical, it deletes the file from source.

I thought someone else might find such a thing useful for either home file management or work environments that are ... similarly non-optimized... and, if so, I'd like to share it if anyone is interested.

I started this evening and I'm mostly done but I thought it would be a good idea to get opinions from anyone who has similar needs if there are additional functions, options, or features I should add to it.  Right now, if the file doesn't exist on the destination it just doesn't delete the file and I'll probably log it or send an email if it runs into issues.

Edit: even if it's been done before by a hundred different people, I decided to finish the script since I was enjoying the process of writing it.  I completed iteration 1, full testing on my local machine.. everything worked great.. then when I decided to test on some live data I encountered an issue where the SAN and server reported different timestamps for the same file, resulting in no objects matching the conditions. 

I reworked the function to get MD5 hashes of the source and backed-up files instead since it was less prone to error.  Still refining my output but the core logic is basically done.

Edit2:  Hit to performance for using hash files is too high, going back to the other method and will determine a proper threshold for acceptable deviance for time.

No one apparently has problems with this. :/

Domain operation Level: 2008 r2

Client: Windows 7 Pro

Problem: I created a group policy that should run one script at the user's logon. It doesn't run.

Diag so far: I have singed my script with a code signing cert from my CA. I have set execution level to allay any powershell script to run. I can run the script on the workstation just fine.

I have three methods of determining if the script ran. Two that tell me if it ran, but couldn't save to the network share.
Neither the popup pops up, not the log is created.

If I run the script from the workstation, it runs fine.

The GPO has the defaults plus Domain Users included in the Delegation and without, with Read access to this GPO.

The script is ran like this from the GPO in the Scripts tab: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -noexit &amp;'\\\server\NETLOGON\save-pcinfo.ps1'
I also tried running the script from the PowerShell Scripts tab, but that does the same thing.
I can run my other .cmd script just fine, just not powershell scripts. :/

I have added other items in the GPO, create a blank file in C:\temp. That gets created. The GPO gets executed as Group Policy Results states that it was applied.


The script is as follows:

    #variables for site
    $centLocation = ""\\server\share\login\hosts.info""
    
    #get needed info for AD
    $name = (get-wmiobject win32_OperatingSystem).__SERVER
    $serial = (Get-wmiobject win32_bios serialnumber).SerialNumber
    $model = (Get-wmiobject Win32_ComputerSystem Model).Model
    $user = (Get-ItemProperty 'hklm:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\' -Name LastLoggedOnSAMUser).LastLoggedOnSAMUser
    
    #save needed to centLocation
    Get-Content $centLocation | Where-Object {$_ -notmatch ""$serial""} | Out-File $centLocation
    $name + "","" + $serial + "","" + $user + "","" + $model| Out-File -Append $centLocation
    
    #My Diag
    
    #make a popup
    $a = get-content env:username
    if ($a -eq ""spyingwind"")
    {
    $a = new-object -comobject wscript.shell
    $b = $a.popup(""spyingwind"",0,""You are"",1)
    }
    
    #Make a log file
    $msg = ""$(Get-Date -format 'u'): save-pcinfo.ps1 Finished.""
    $msg | Out-File c:\temp\pcinfo.txt



Edit: updated with correct \\

Edit2: Moving the script to the Computer Config on Startup runs the script. I've tried adding Domain Users to the Policy, but that didn't change a thing. Adding Loopback as TheMuffnMan suggested, just caused the test machine to take longer to login than normal.

As a treat here is the other half of the script that runs on a schedule on a server.

    import-module ActiveDirectory
    $centLocation = ""\\server\share\login\hosts.info""
    $header = ""COMP"",""SERI"",""USER"",""MODEL""
    $cont = (Get-Content $centLocation); $cont = $cont[0], $cont[1]; $cont = $centLocation
    
    $contH = Import-Csv $centLocation -Header $header
    Foreach ( $line in $contH ) {

Now, here's the catch... output from these scripts must output to the current shell, if they open a new shell, output, and close, cmk will not catch it.  I should be able to runas administrator, dump the output to a file, and then have the script read the output file in the current shell, but I cannot believe that windows does not have a way to run an elevated process in the current shell, and I really don't want to write a file to the HDD once a minute for no godly reason.

I've been using Powershell for a while now and even though I'm not 100% technical on the ins and outs of PS, I had a quick project that I needed to uninstall an application/service from 300+ workstations and figured PS was the way to go as I've used it before.

So the problem, the application wasn't showing up when I would perform Get-WMIObject queries, the application was also not installed using an MSI file and repackaging it as an MSI file wasn't helping either.

I quickly discovered that if I executed the following in command line, it would successfully remove the application using the app's own uninstaller executable:

    C:\Program Files\application\unins000.exe /Silent

So I wrote a quick script in PS to attempt to perform this action, but every time I ran it, the script would either appear to exit successfully or it would give me some errors which all seemed to be more from my lack of experience with flags and operators than anything. 

Here's the script:

    $servers = Get-Content serverlist.txt
    $command = &amp; ""C:\Program Files\app\unins000.exe"" /Silent
    
    foreach($server in $servers){
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server -ScriptBlock {$command}}

That's pretty much the bulk of the issue at hand, I have more for the script but it's mostly for logging and installing the new application (which was thankfully packaged in a nice MSI file). 

I had a PS Shell open on my own workstation and this string worked perfectly for me:

    &amp; ""C:\Program Files\app\unins000.exe"" /Silent

But go and throw it in the above and nothing was working :-/

I ended up using PSTools with the following one-liner, but I want to know where I went wrong in Powershell and how I can fix it for future reference

    powershell -noprofile -c ""&amp; %PSFILE%"" &gt;&gt; %location%\logs\%logFIle% 2&gt;&amp;1 

However, this often requires this stdin/stderr fix for PS v2:

	$bindingFlags = [Reflection.BindingFlags] “Instance,NonPublic,GetField”
	$objectRef = $host.GetType().GetField(“externalHostRef”, $bindingFlags).GetValue($host)

	$bindingFlags = [Reflection.BindingFlags] “Instance,NonPublic,GetProperty”
	$consoleHost = $objectRef.GetType().GetProperty(“Value”, $bindingFlags).GetValue($objectRef, @())

	[void] $consoleHost.GetType().GetProperty(“IsStandardOutputRedirected”, $bindingFlags).GetValue($consoleHost, @())
	$bindingFlags = [Reflection.BindingFlags] “Instance,NonPublic,GetField”
	$field = $consoleHost.GetType().GetField(“standardOutputWriter”, $bindingFlags)
	$field.SetValue($consoleHost, [Console]::Out)
	$field2 = $consoleHost.GetType().GetField(“standardErrorWriter”, $bindingFlags)
	$field2.SetValue($consoleHost, [Console]::Out)

Then I generally handle writing to a ""log"" by just letting stuff fall through the pipe to write-output

    ""$(Get-Date -f 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss') INFO | DOING SOMETHING""

I really like this because it handles any errors I might forget to grab in a `try/catch/fail`. 

**However**, letting stuff fall through the pipe can have one PITA problem -- if you're returning objects.

Take the following example of code that would cause issues:

    $disksToUse = Foreach ($disk in $disks) {
	if ($archiveLocationsRoots -contains $disk.DeviceID)
	{
		$diskTotal += $disk.Freespace
		
		$percentageFreeSpace = ($disk.FreeSpace / $disk.Size)
		if ($percentageFreeSpace -le 0.95)
		{
			(Get-Date -f ""yyyMMdd-HHmmss"") + "" WARNING! The amount of free space in $($disk.DeviceID) is only $percentageFreeSpace - $($disk.FreeSpace/1024/1024/1024) GB free of $($disk.Size/1024/1024/1024) GB total.""
		} else {
			(Get-Date -f ""yyyMMdd-HHmmss"") + "" The amount of free space in $($disk.DeviceID) is $percentageFreeSpace - $($disk.FreeSpace/1024/1024/1024) GB free of $($disk.Size/1024/1024/1024) GB total.""
		}
		$disk | Select *,@{N=""percentageFreeSpace"";E={$percentageFreeSpace}}
	}

The alternative would be to re-write the application logic to perform another query against the returned data *afterwards*.

**I realize** that common solutions are to use `Start-Transcript` or using a custom `Write-ToLogFile` that just uses `Set-Content -Append`. However, the one thing I don't like about that approach is it won't capture any errors I might have foolishly not tried to handle. I'm also not a huge fan of the output from `Start-Transcript` as I often don't really want to see such a cluttered log.

These executables seem to be poorly written in that, even on a successful operation, they output the result to Standard Error instead of Standard Output.  

For example:

    .\symclone.exe -g $groupName -establish $sourceDevice sym ld $targetDevice -noprompt

Returns:

    symclone.exe :
    + CategoryInfo         : NotSpecified: (:String) [], RemoteException

    'Incremental Establish' operation successfully initiated for device 'SourceDevice' in group 'DeviceGroup' paired with target device 'TargetDevice'.

This is perfectly expected and running as normal.  Unfortunately the tool has been written to throw an error for this.  Even worse: this is not consistent. Another executable from the same set of tools will output the result to Standard Output.  

My dilemma is how to best handle this from PowerShell since I then need to parse the return string to check it's doing what I want.  

My current solution involves using *Start-Process* with *-RedirectStandardError* and *-RedirectStandardOutput* to output to a text file (these switches don't allow output to variables).  I then check both of the text files and do my RegEx on the contents to check what the executable has done.

I found no good way of doing it, so i'm running two searches, where the second one is super slow (performing | where {_.name -eq $dataONE} 


    If ($inputTWO.name -contains $dataONE)
    			{$inTWO = ""RecordISinTWO""
    			$matching = ($inputTWO -match $dataONE)
    			$matchingCORRECT = ($matching | where {$_.name -eq $dataONE})
    			$inTWOType = $matchingCORRECT.type
    			}
    
The problem with the first search ""-match"" is that it also gives me records that are called ""hostnameBLABLA"" as -match is not -equals, and -eq can only search in .name and not the whole array. 

**See example for fast, not exact search:**

All servers are 08R2.  The server the script runs from is a VM with an allocated 16GB RAM and 4 X5680 Intel Xeon processors at 3.33 Ghz.  The script runs fine, pulling information and inputting it into the desired format.  However, the script runs incredibly slow and hogs all the memory.  All 16 GB. Every iteration it seems to increase anywhere from 1MB to 10MB of usage until the server has nothing left.  This of course affects other processes on the server.  I have played around with using outstream versus Out-File, piping the directories directly through a foreach-object loop, and a couple other simple things.  It also takes forever to run.  Most of the DFS shares we are auditing have roughly 50k folders and the script will run for days, keeping the server memory pegged the whole time.  In addition, and this is really tangential but worth mentioning, it does nothing to address the wonderful character limit for processing files / folders.  Anyway, I have been beating my head against a wall for a little while now, trying various things, so I am appealing to this community for help.  Thanks in advance!

Edit1: I should also add, I am using Powershell v3.0 and the DFS shares are hosted on separate servers sitting on the same subnet with response times of less than a millisecond.

If I launch a powershell command window and run a script such as test.ps1 it completes in just a few milliseconds. If I instead run powershell from the command line such as ""powershell.exe -nologo -noninteractive -noprofile -file test.ps1"", it takes about 10 seconds to complete. I knew there would be some overhead of loading powershell modules, and .Net framework, but I didn't expect it to be that long. Is there a way to easily get powershell to run faster from a command line? Is it better with version 3? I think 3 only loads modules on the fly if you need them.

Event 805 and Event 307.

Initially I was using the $event805.Event.UserData.RenderJobDiag.JobId to match the two events but I have found that the JobID resets after it hits 255.

I would like to use the $event805.Event.System.Execution.ThreadID to match the events, but I am unsure as to whether the ThreadID is always constant for any given print job.

Alternatively I could use the $event805.Event.System.EventRecordID which appears to log event805 and then event307, this would allow me to search for the previous event when joining the data.

Anyone have insight into this issue or know of a better way to connect the two events?

In Windows 2008, it's simple...Just ""winrm quickconfig"" and it starts a listener that Powershell can connect to for a session.

Some other 2003 servers will not respond, and I need to figure out why and how to fix this.

Sorry If I seem like one of those people who just needs someone to write some code for them really quick, I am deeply interested in working with powershell to help automate admin tasks. 

Here is my problem. I have been given a spreadsheet .xlsx file with a list of over 600 user names and information. Column A has last names, B first names, c to J are misc information that if I ran a script would just get into the way. In column K I need to export an ID number. The ID number is already on *most* everyones account and is located in the ""User logon name"" field. 

Basically, if I made a .csv or similar file how could I code it so that it either:
A) searches for each user on file and imports logon name next to it
B) pulls a list of all account information from the users account and I just remove the columns that I do not need. 

I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/related/13sgwf/looking_for_some_help_in_getting_powershell_to/) thread that matches a little about what I want to do.

I would be content with taking an export of all the users in OU x and editing out the information I need.

The current idea for the config script is to have it craft a custom object containing important directories, external executables, domain controllers, etc..

I have the object setup like so:  

     $obj   #parent object
     $obj.config  #Child Configuration object
     $obj.config.dir #Containts all relavent directories 
     $obj.config.dir.function #Contains powershell function locations (ie.AD,Exchange,Misc) 
     $obj.config.exe #Contains all external executable files (TODO: Paramaters?)
     $obj.config.dc.(parent,child1,child2)
     $obj.config.email #contain distribtion lists

This works fine so far, my current problem is verifying path's and such in each of the objects.  For instance $obj.config.exe should contain the UNC paths to programs such as psexec (don't judge).  I would like to refer to it in scripts via $obj.config.exe.psexec, so I use the following code to populate the $.exe subobject.

     function add-Exe(){
     $exe = New-Object system.Object
     $exe | Add-Member -MemberType mem -Name ""7zip"" -Value ($obj.dir.programs + ""\7zip\7z.exe"")
     $exe | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name ""Psexec"" -Value ($obj.dir.programs + ""\sysinternals\psexec.exe"")

     return $exe
     }

     $config | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name ""exe"" -value $(add-exe) 

So my question:  Is there a way to enumerate my $config.exe object to return all subproperties and test their UNC values? 
I am currently trying variations of:
 
      #Test external executable paths
      $config.exe | %{$exe = $_ ;#Test for executables
      if((Test-Path $exe) -eq $false){$warningObj += ""Not Found: $exe .`n""}
      Clear-Variable exe
      }
 The idea is to send an email to a group letting them know if any parts of this initialization script fail.

I have a small script that I created which I intend to use with my Nagios monitoring system (in combination with NSClient++/check_nrpe) on a client PC end, in order to check the load times for a few specific internal web pages (we have one office that always reports very long load times).

Goals of the script:  

 * accept command line variable input for url, user, password, domain, search string, warning and crit times.
 * return some help text if any of the required variables are missing
 * load the given website, using ntlm authentication
 * grab a timestamp before and after loading the webpage, and use this as an assumed page load time (i know this won't be perfectly accurate, but when using as a comparison between computers/offices/sites it should work i think)
 * look at the returned webpage for the given text string
 * provide Nagios friendly results (ie a short sentence about the status and an exit code of 0/1/2/3/4 for OK/Warning/Critical/Unknown status)

If I get it working properly and well enough, I intend to put it up on the Nagios Exchange for others to use; but I feel like I need to provide better error handling or something..


The Script...

    &lt;#
    .SYNOPSIS
    This Powershell script was created for use with nsclient++/check_nrpe/nagios in order to check the load time of a given website. It currently only uses NTLM authentication.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    The script accepts input parameters for URL, username, password, login domain, search string, crit and warn times. It uses .net's web client functionality in order to grab the given page.
    
    It grabs the system timestamp immediately before and after getting the page in order to calculate how long it took to execute that bit.  It then looks at the returned page and searches for the given text string.
    
    If it takes too long to load the page, or the search string isn't found it will return a nagios friendly status code. It currently accepts the password in plain text and then converts it into a more secure form.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    
    Script: 
    check_site.ps1 -url ""http://intranet.contoso.com"" -user ""tuser"" -pass ""Reset123"" -dom ""contoso"" -find ""hello"" -w 2 -c 6

My end goal is to have a working script which spits out a list of groups where a certain user has 'Write Members' security on the group.

There is a piece of web-based software that lets users manage access to file shares without having to call the helpdesk or use AD. The list of shares a user can manage are the groups on which they have 'Write Members' security.

So far I have used the Quest tools to achieve this as they have been the most documented while researching a solution, though I would prefer to find a solution that used the activedirectory module.

My current working script:

    Get-QADObject -ShowProgress -SearchRoot 'full.domain.name/path/to/fileshareshare/groups' `
    -SearchScope 'OneLevel' -Type Group -SizeLimit 1500 -LdapFilter '(name=site_name_*)' `

    -Account ""username"" -WarningAction SilentlyContinue | `
    Select -Property TargetObject,Account | Export-CSV C:\Scripts\managedGroups.csv

This spits out a CSV:

TargetObject|Account|
-|-
domain\site_name_share1|domain\username
domain\site_name_share2|domain\username
domain\site_name_share3|domain\username

I'm going to guess that there's a far easier way of doing this, or at least a way I can instead use Get-ADGroup with Get-ACL.

These procedures need to be written as a script (Hence my need for PowerShell to read a webpage). The issue I'm having is that I am not able to read the text of the article (what you would see in the browser) Instead I keep reading the code behind the article.  I tried creating net.webclient object, I've also tried saving the web page to harddisk and using select-string on the file. Same result either way.

Basically, is there a way to get PowerShell to read the user-side text on a webpage?

schtask.exe leaves much to be desired because from what I can tell the /SC (trigger) flag is not valid for schtask /change.

I've also tried using Get-WmiObject and Invoke-Command, but GWMI is unreliable at best and Invoke-Command relies on me having powershell remoting enabled on the remote PC.

I'm sure most of you have better things to do than troubleshoot my script, but I'm not very good at this and can't seem to find where I'm failing.

I am brand new to PowerShell and scripting in general. I am trying to automate checking that shares on a server are operational.

So this is what I have, but when I run it through ISE, I am still getting results like C$, E$, etc. included. Maybe ya'll can tell me whats wrong:

    $s1 = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Share -computer computername
    
    foreach ($i in $s1)
    
    {if ($i.name -notcontains ""$"")

I have an issue where I'd like to have a progress bar for the progress of a get-childitem command. Get-childitem itself doesn't seem to hold any such variables unless you store the result in a variable, but by the time that variable is assigned it's too late. It's finished by then. So as I wanted to recurse folders and just sitting there waiting for the variable to be set isn't good enough, I figured I'd make my own recursive function to try and get an estimate.

Since I can't predict the total number of folders I will be traversing I cant set percentages immediately, but will have to go with some kind of median where I keep adding to a global variable the number of folders/subfolders seen so far during the traversal. But I've found a funny behaviour that I don't think is appropriate for a global variable. 
Here's a short example

    $global:numfolders
    Function MyOwnRecurse($folder) {
        Get-ChildItem $folder | Where  { $_.PSIsContainer } | ForEach-Object {
            $numfolders += (Get-ChildItem $folder | Where  { $_.PSIsContainer }).Length
            $numfolders
            MyOwnRecurse $_.FullName
        }
    }

    MyOwnRecurse X:\Folder\SubFolder


The output from the $numfolders is the following

    3
    7
    12
    17
    22
    27
    32
    11

    87
    96
    19
    6
    9
    12
    15
    18

Since I'm not passing the variable through to the function, which would give this kind of behaviour, but simply adding to the global variable, why is it Rolling back to a lower value as if it had been passed through to the function during it's iteration?

I'm writing a script to search for items created between specific dates but starting off I can't even seem to be able to check if a value equals another. The below code returns CreationTime  for one .exe file.

Now if I run the following code it works:

    gci -path H:\ -r -filter *exe | where-object{$_.CreationTime -ge ""07/18/2013 16:25:40""}

The above piece of code works but this is where I get stuck. Now If I replace “-ge” with “-eq” it returns nothing. No matter how accurately I add the parameter for createTime it does not return a value if check for equality.

    gci -path H:\ -r -filter *exe | where-object{$_.CreationTime -eq ""07/18/2013 16:25:40""} - Returns nothing

Another very confusing  aspect is that it displays the date as dd/mm/yy when I call get-date or creationTime but only takes mm/dd/yy as input.
As you can see below although calling CreateTime (as seen inabove) returns 18/07/2013 4:25:40 p.m. it wants 07/18/2013 16:25:40 as input.

We've got a few print servers due to some wonky requirements by some of our software vendors, so eventually this script will keep print queues in sync with each other across different servers. Idea being, instead of setting up a printer 4 times on 4 different servers, plug properties into a .csv and fire off to all 4 servers at once.

Here's the code I'm using:

    $print = ([WMICLASS]""\\$server\ROOT\cimv2:Win32_Printer"").createInstance() 
    $print.ServerName = $server
    $print.DriverName = $printer.DriverName
    $print.PortName = $printer.PortName

This is a pretty generic error that basically means ""I don't like one of your parameters"". I looked it up and see tons of people having the same problem, but it always ends up being a driver that's not installed on the server or a port that doesn't exist on the server, neither of which apply in my situation. So I did some troubleshooting and found that if I first assigned the ""Generic / Text Only"" driver, it would create the print object. Furthermore, once the print object was created, I could change it to whatever driver I wanted and it seemed to work fine. Here's what I'm using now.

    $print = ([WMICLASS]""\\$server\ROOT\cimv2:Win32_Printer"").createInstance() 
    $print.ServerName = $server
    $print.DriverName =  ""Generic / Text Only""
    $print.PortName = $printer.PortName
    $print.DeviceID = $printer.DeviceID 
    $print.Put()
    $print.DriverName = $printer.DriverName
    $print.put()

This works fine, but feels really sloppy. Does anyone have any idea why it would prevent me from creating the object with the correct driver to begin with, but then later allow me to assign the same driver it complained about to an existing object?",,False,,t5_2qo1o,False,,,True,t3_1hykig,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1hykig/strange_behavior_adding_print_queue_over_wmi/,

We often find situations where it would be helpful to clean up profiles.  Tools like [delprof](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5405) and [delprof2](http://helgeklein.com/free-tools/delprof2-user-profile-deletion-tool/) make this handy, but there are times you might not want to depend on these, or licensing may not permit their use.

[Remove-Profile](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Remove-Profile-787d9188) will remove profiles based on profile age, specified profile names, and with specified exclusions.  The profile names and exclusions are inserted into a regex ""^ username$"" (no space between ^ and the username, Reddit formatting issue); you can thus use regexes within these, keeping in mind they will have a ^ and $ added to them.  For example, I could specify -profiles JohnDoe, Mary.*, JeffDoe; JohnDoe, JeffDoe, and any profile starting with Mary would be removed.

Given that local profiles may contain important data (note: you should fix this!), this command supports -whatif and -confirm.  I would recommend running get-help \\path\to\remove-profile.ps1 -full to take a look at the available parameters, and some notes I included in the Description section.

We use this to regularly clean up profiles on a few servers where mandatory profiles or other solutions present application compatibility issues, and our support team uses them to clean out old profiles on workstations on an ad hoc basis.

Boe Prox provided a [helpful post](http://learn-powershell.net/2010/11/01/quick-hit-find-currently-logged-on-users/) on the topic covering the drawbacks of WMI, a cool function that parses query session (note: no idle time in this), and the [PSTerminalServices module](http://psterminalservices.codeplex.com/releases/view/65937) by Shay Levy.  PSTerminalServices is a fantastic module by the way, and if I could get away with dependencies I would have stuck with that.

So!  It looks like the best way to pull this data is query user.  Boe already provided code for parsing query session, figured I would take the same approach.  The only problem here is that query user has variable output; if the Idle Time is something like '24692+13:29', that line will get pushed out a few characters and mess with out parsing.  Okay, let's split each line into strings!  This won't work either.  Certain fields will occasionally contain no data.  Fortunately, a combination of the two methods does the trick (according to my initial testing).  We parse by substrings if the line length is 82.  If the line length is greater than this, we parse by arrays.

The result is a quick query for the following info on one or more computers: ComputerName, Username, SessionName, Id, State, IdleTime, LogonTime

Please note that you may need to configure your environment for this to work.  You will need query.exe (you probably have this already), permissions to the remote system, and the remote system will need to be configured for [Remote RPC](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff710472.aspx).  You can run the script as is, or wrap it up in a function for a module, profile, or script you run.

Side note:  Does anyone know what the format is for Idle Time?  . means less than a minute.  Most values are readable... But I get a number of sessions with cryptic idle times like '24692+13:29' or '1+08:31'.

I keep my end users locked out of admin so they don't break things. One of our clients pushes update to our server that then has to update individual computers next time the program runs. This fails because the end users are not admin.

They give me &lt;4 hours notice every update (every other month).  So I don't feel bad about the client breaking their own system everytime they push an update and communicate poorly. But I am getting tired of manually making the program run as local admin after they push a surprise update. So I decided to throw together a quick command line to run it remotely with admin creds. While I was putting it together I thought, Why don't I explore if there is a way to use powershell to check installed programs, see if the computer has the program and if it does start it up as admin.

So I was thinking since I am complete novice to powershell, I would ask a couple questions.

A: Is this a good way to use power shell.
B: Is this how someone else might approach it.


As far as getting it together I see it as 2 parts.

Get a csv of the computers I want to have this run against (and it is a mix of ~200 machines ~50% have the program and 50% don't)

Run powershell against that CSV doing a get WMIobject to find installed programs [link](http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2011/11/13/use-powershell-to-quickly-find-installed-software.aspx)

Take the output of that and pass down computers that have specific installed program.

Launch program using credentials for local admin.

The program will then fire up on all machines listed in the CSV that met requirements.

Write results back to CSV.


The only other way I am thinking to get this working is maybe read directly from OU instead of bothering with a CSV.

Is this a good way to utilize PowerShell or would I be better off falling back on VBS or just going with a command line. 

Is there a better way to do what I am thinking about doing then how I outlined it?

But I figure the Fix-Quotes function is still useful to those that may have to fix this issue on a wide scale.

It has me really stumped as I am not at all proficient with powershell command lines. Any help or hints would be appreciated.



for simplicity's sake. I will copy paste the exact problem being asked.

""Submit a csv file via email to create an OU named lastname-xyz (where xyz = your initials) and to create five users that will be salespeople and will work in the sales department for a company named Stuff. The users are named yourFirstNameX yourLastNameX (where X is a number from 1 to 5 inclusive). These will be created in the forest root domain in your forest. The properties must include DN, job title, first name, last name, upn, company name and any other items that are necessary to make it work.
Please also submit a printout of your file (format it in Excel so that the text in each column prints in full).""

**EDIT1** I figured out the answer to my question. For those wondering. it is a two part deal. part 1 is the creation of the oU which can be done using CSVDE. using the cmd csvde -i -f ""filename"" will inject the OU to the root domain.

the syntax within the csv file you just ran would be:
    DN,instanceType,distinguishedName,objectCategory,objectClass,ou,name,
""OU=Woodward-JMW,DC=morris,DC=lab"",4,""OU=Woodward-JMW,DC=morris,DC=lab"",""CN=Organizational-
Unit,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=morris,DC=lab"",organizationalUnit,Woodward-JMW,Woodward-JMW

the second part of the answer is to inject the users, using the same cmd line method the syntax of the second file would then be:

    DN,objectClass,sn,givenName,SAMAccountName,userPrincipalName,company,deprtment,title
    ""CN=Jason1 Woodward1,OU=Woodward-JMW,DC=Stuff,DC=com"",user,Woodward1,Jason1,Jason1.Woodward1,Jason1.Woodward1@Stuff.com,Stuff,Sales,Salesperson

This is my first post and my first powershell script. I don't really have much experience with this language, but I had fun with this. Basically this script is getting hostnames from files on some other server, gets number of event 6005 (The Event log service was started) in 1 month to check how many restarts the host had.

I'm sure this script has a lot of room for improvements to be ran quicker, since it is kind of slow right now. Thanks in advance for all tips.

1355438397.0,3,self.PowerShell,14t61q,I'm totally stumped by trying to time out a command properly. Help?,jwestbury,5,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/14t61q/im_totally_stumped_by_trying_to_time_out_a/,"Context: I'm in a foreach loop, working through a supplied list of VMs, stopping them, locating and copying their VHDs, and restarting them -- I'm running several servers which support integration drivers, but don't support VSS, so they can't be copied successfully without shutting down first (or so I'm told?).

One of my problems is that some of these VMs occasionally encounter a problem where the Stop-VM command hangs due to something going on within the VM -- I've had this happen on a Windows XP VM I've been testing with, for instance, where a prompt which appears at boot which actually prevent shutdown... but it doesn't throw an error, so I can't rely on errors to tell me what's going on.

As such, I want to put a five-minute timeout on my Stop-VM commands. After looking around, I believe running something as a background job is my best bet, here: I can use Start-Job, put my stop-vm command in a script block, and add a Wait-Job/Stop-Job, then evaluate whether or not the job was completed or if it was stopped prematurely. This works great -- in test cases.

Trouble is, Start-Job creates an independent runtime, and in that runtime I have no access to my profile or any variables created outside of this runtime... which means that the name of the VM (passed in as an argument to the script via schtasks, theoretically) is not accessible by the job.

Here's the snippet of code I was trying :

    Start-Job -name stop -ScriptBlock {
        if(Stop-VM -Name $vmname) {
            Write-EventLog -LogName Scripts -Source VMBackup -EntryType Information -EventId 2201 -Message ""$vmName stopped successfully."";
        } else {
            Write-EventLog -LogName Scripts -Source VMBackup -EntryType Error -EventId 2215 -Message ""$vmName failed to stop: `n`n $error[0]"";
        }
    }
    Wait-Job -name stop -Timeout 300; #if stopping the VM takes longer than five minutes, exit the job with the following
    Stop-Job -name stop;


What I want to do is then evaluate whether or not the command within the job was successful, and, if not, skip the current VM and move to the next (a continue in my foreach). I can accomplish that easily enough, even without passing data back out of the job -- just check my most recent event log entry, or check $error[0], or something. No problem.

But since I can't pass variables into my job, that doesn't work. I've tried the -InputObject arugment on Start-Job, i.e.:

    Start-Job -name stop -InputObject $vmname -ScriptBlock { whatever }

And I know that, when I do this, I need to reference $input within my script block, not $vmname. But this results in $input being empty, it seems -- my event log gets this entry in it: "" failed to stop: ...""

I've also tried $($input) instead of just $input, thinking maybe I had to cast it as a string, because it was being interpreted as an object.

Soooo... how the hell do I get this damned Stop-VM cmdlet to time out? :(",,False,,t5_2qo1o,False,,,True,t3_14t61q,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/14t61q/im_totally_stumped_by_trying_to_time_out_a/,

I guess the only way to really learn is to ask questions and fiddle around.

The only issue I've run into now is that whenever the email sends out, the Log output comes in a text file attached to the email.  This is obnoxious because now I have to click the attachment in Outlook to see the output.  This is really just a minor inconvenience and more a personal preference kind of thing, but I'd much prefer the output to come through in the body of the email and I can't quite figure out how to get that working.  Going to continue fiddling with it over time and hopefully get it working.

I want to thank everyone for the pointers and help.  I'm also new to scripting (new to everything, really) and am anxious to find time to learn it proper.  You'll probably see much more of me around here.

My most recent task involves creating a directory for a user on our server with their name, giving them modify permissions to the directory, and setting it as their home drive in active directory. The end goal is to create a script that will set up home drives by reading employee names from a .csv.

The below script provides me with most of the results I'm looking for. The only problem arises when I go into the GUI to look at the shared properties of the directory. The Network Path is listed but when I go into ""Advanced Sharing"" the ""Share this folder"" box is unchecked. The folder is not shared and it can not be accessed from other machines. Checking the box fixes the issue, obviously.

Is there an error in my code below? I'm relatively new to programming and I've been working out of PowerShell for less than a month at this point. I'm also self-taught, so I apologize for poor PowerShell formatting.

(For the sake of security, the server is $server and the domain is $domain)

So, as you can see, pretty simple query bringing back two columns of string results. So. The results are in memory and I can print them if necessary using Write-Host, but I don't want to do this. What I need is to Stop-Service of each of the BII_SSERVICENAMES on the BII_SMACHINENAMEs. Each command would be constructed thus:

So I'd need to create a loop of all the results in the query run previously. How do??

I have a working VBScript which does this (which I didn't write, and as you might imagine is bloated and unwieldy), so while this is more of an educational exercise than anything it would be great to get working to learn about loops and queries etc. Anyone have any ideas?

OK for setting certain stuff, like IIS, uses inverted commas and brackets that powershell also uses, so to do certain commands powershell is trying to interpret what Im putting through as commands for itself, not to basically pipe to the command.

EG:
&gt;$IIS1 = 'Set-ItemProperty IIS:\AppPools\'

&gt;$IIS2 = $SitePoolName + ' -name processModel -value @{userName=""'

&gt;$IIS3 = $SiteUser + '"";password=""' + $SitePassword + '"";identitytype=3}'

&gt;$IIS4 = $IIS1 + $IIS2 + $IIS3

&gt;invoke-expression $IIS4

Will run the command: (With the variables just set as the same name, however Im actually using this in a for loop)

&gt;Set-ItemProperty IIS:\AppPools\sitepoolname -name processModel -value @{userName=""siteuser"";password=""sitepassword"";ide
ntitytype=3}

That works exactly as expected because I use the symbol ' to stop the inverted commas and brackets from messing it over, while also using variables.  So how would I do that with, say, one line?

I have been using the following script to generate a report and mail it every Monday:

HOST cpu1 192.168.20.61 cwp

HOST cpu2 192.168.20.62 cwp

HOST cpu3 192.168.20.63 cwp

There is other content in the file, but I pick this stuff out with:

$items = (get-content machine_list.txt | select-string ""host"")

And I would like to simply run something like

foreach ($item in $items) {cmdkey /add:$item[2] /user:name /pass:pass}

But this [2] pulls the second letter, not the second word from each line.


I am not a network admin, nor do I have any real experience in comp sci or engineering, I'm simply trying to stream line a process.

Can anyone tell me how to pick the second whole word out of each line to use in a command?

Much appreciated!

It turns out my domain is not properly scavenging our DNS records, and there are some old entries that occasionally pop up and cause problems.  I'm getting ready to turn on scavenging following the tips in [this article](http://blogs.technet.com/b/networking/archive/2008/03/19/don-t-be-afraid-of-dns-scavenging-just-be-patient.aspx), and one step says ""Sift through your DNS records looking for any records older than the Refresh + No-Refresh interval.""  Sounds easy, except for the fact that there are hundreds of them spread across hundreds of DNS zones.

You can [query your DNS servers using WMI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682125%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), but I couldn't find an obvious way to query for resource records with old timestamps.  This is complicated by the fact that each DNS zone can have its own scavenging intervals.

Here's what I've come up with.  (WARNING: this may blow up your server, your network, and/or your domain.  I'm not responsible for that.)

    # change this to your DNS server
    $dnsserver = 'dc01'

    # don't change these

    $epoch = get-date '01/01/1601'

    # figuring out the default scavenge interval in hours, default is 7 days
    # ...not really sure if this is needed because zones have their own
    # ...but it's there anyway
    $defaultNoRefreshInterval = $defaultRefreshInterval = 7 * 24
    gwmi -computername $dnsserver -namespace 'root\MicrosoftDNS' -class 'MicrosoftDNS_Server' -filter ""Name like '%$dnsserver%'"" |
        % {
            $defaultNoRefreshInterval = $_.DefaultNoRefreshInterval
            $defaultRefreshInterval = $_.DefaultRefreshInterval
        }
    $defaultScavengeInterval = $defaultNoRefreshInterval + $defaultRefreshInterval

    # collecting zone info
    $zones = @{}
    gwmi -computername $dnsserver -namespace 'root\MicrosoftDNS' -class 'MicrosoftDNS_Zone' |
        # each zone has its own scavenge intervals in hours
        % { add-member -inputobject $_ NoteProperty 'ScavengeInterval' ($_.norefreshinterval + $_.refreshinterval) -passthru } |
        % { $zones[$_.name] = $_ }

    # collecting resource records...
    # ...include only ""IN"" (Internet) class records
    # ...filter out static records (i.e. no timestamp)
    $records = gwmi -computername $dnsserver -namespace 'root\MicrosoftDNS' -class 'MicrosoftDNS_ResourceRecord' -filter 'RecordClass=1 and Timestamp&lt;&gt;0' | 
        # adding attributes useful to human beings
        % { add-member -inputobject $_ NoteProperty 'WhenChanged' $epoch.addhours($_.timestamp).tolocaltime() -passthru } |
        % { add-member -inputobject $_ NoteProperty 'Class' ($_.__CLASS -replace '^.+_([^_]+)Type$', '$1') -passthru } | 
        # filter out records not yet old enough to scavenge
        ? { 
            if ($zones.containskey($_.containername)) {
                $zone = $zones[$_.containername]
                ($zone.aging) -and (($now - $_.whenchanged).totalhours -gt $zone.ScavengeInterval)
            } else {
                ($now - $_.whenchanged).totalhours -gt $defaultScavengeInterval
            }
        }

You can dump these records into the console using Format-Table:

    $records | sort Class, OwnerName | ft -auto OwnerName, RecordData, WhenChanged -group Class

Export to a CSV (e.g. for Excel):

    $records | select Class, OwnerName, RecordData, WhenChanged | sort Class, OwnerName | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation u:\ExpiringDNSRecords.csv

I don't know if this will actually help or cause other problems, but you can tell all the computers listed in the A Records to re-register their DNS:

    $records | ? {$_.class -eq 'A'} | select -exp recorddata | % { psexec.exe ""\\$_"" ipconfig /registerdns }

This morning I was tasked with writing a script to search AD computer objects for strings contained in the description for the purpose of asset retrieval. I wrote the following one line command which returns the correct values:

    $strings = Get-Content -Path C:\DescriptionStrings.txt
    foreach ($string in $strings)
    {
    Get-ADComputer -Filter 'description -like ""*$string*""'

I added a write-host above my get-adcomputer command to verify that the script was moving through the text file as expected, which it was.

This is my first attempt at a Powershell script. It was an interview question (sort of like homework) and I have no idea what the 'grading scale' was. I already submitted my work to the manager but wanted to see how y'all thought I did. Here was the prompt:

Scenario:
There is a critical file that needs to be backed up throughout the day to protect against possible corruption.  Build a PowerShell script to copy a file from one folder to another and implement a required file retention policy.  The source file data will change over time.

Setup:
-	Create a folder c:\PowerShell
-	Create a folder c:\PowerShell\Source
-	Create a folder c:\PowerShell\Backup
-	Create a source text file with a few lines of random text within as c:\PowerShell\Source\Source.txt

Requirements:

-	The script will run on the same computer the source file and destination files are located on.
-	The script will be run manually from PowerShell.
-	Each time the script is run, it will get the current time, round down to the nearest 15 minutes and copy c:\PowerShell\Source\Source.txt to c:\PowerShell\Backup\SourceHHMM.txt (where HHMM is the time rounded down to the nearest 15 minutes in 24 hour time format including leading zeros).
-	Over time, this script will end up overwriting files.  If the file to be overwritten is not older than 23 hours, the script should not overwrite the file.
-	The script should only create files If run between the hours of 6 AM and Midnight.
-	Implement a logging function to write your script’s activity to c:\PowerShell\Backup\Log.txt

Deliverables:

-	Phase 1:

o	Sketch out a flowchart showing the proposed logic of your script.  Use “pseudo code” to describe processes that occur (you don’t have to know syntax).
o	Create test cases to use for the following phases.
o	Review with me before continuing.

-	Phase 2:

o	Create the folders and files in the setup section.
o	Begin to code your script.  At this phase, it only needs to be able to get the time and copy the file to the Backup folder using the correct rounding and naming convention.  It will always overwrite at this point.
o	Show me that this runs and meets your test cases created for this phase.

-	Phase 3:

o	Implement the time restrictions in your script (6AM to Midnight)
o	Implement the file overwrite logic in your script (do not overwrite if file is less than 23 hours old)

-	Phase 4:

o	Implement the logging function.
o	Log the following to c:\PowerShell\Backup\Log.txt, a file your script creates.
	The date and time the script starts
	The file it will attempt to generate
	If the file exists in the backup directory
	Whether or not the file will be overwritten, created, or skipped
o	The log file should only maintain information for the current calendar day.

Examples (Phase 3 Complete):

-	Script is run at 1:48 PM, no files exist in Backup folder
o	Script copies file as Source1345.txt
-	Script is run at 8:48 AM, file Source0845.txt exists in the Backup folder and was created at 8:47 AM yesterday
o	Script overwrites file Source0845.txt with data currently in source.txt
-	Script is run at 11:32 AM, file Source1130.txt exists in the Backup folder and was created at 11:31 AM today
o	Script does not copy the file
-	Script is run at 4:15 AM, file Source0415.txt does not exist in the Backup folder
o	Script does not copy the file

So, I've been working on a script that is parsing error logs. That's not important: what I have is a txt file that contains the Log text, a couple of integers and a text string I need to extract. I need to take all four of these things as variables and pass them off to either a SQL query or the body of an email. The latter aspect of the problem is all sorted, but getting the right content from the files is causing me a great deal of suffering!

I've been using Regex. Sigh. 

My regex can pull matches from the text, but I only need a part of that match. For example, this is (a small part of) the string I'll be using: 

     InstanceId         : 34202
     Message            : Error in Query :

               AGR_LKEY : 71501
               Query    : 

The regex (at present) is: ""AGR_LKEY : ([0-9]{4,})""

This brings back AGR_LKEY : 71501, which is fine, but I only need the number. Given my knowledge of Regex is extremely narrow, I can't work out - even with a lot of Googling - if it is even possible to use Regex to use ""AGR_LKEY : "" as a ""anchor"" in the text, and to give me the number that comes *after* that, and assign it as a variable. Is such a thing even possible?

I played around with a few different approaches, and the most flexible seeming to me was to use an AD account (one for each department) as the template, and use the new-aduser -instance to copy over the account properties. I like this because I can let the less technical staff make updates to default settings easily, and the ADUC console is one they are already familiar with. Here's what I have:

    	$template = get-aduser -identity $depts[$userinfo.department].template -properties city,country,company,department,description,Fax,HomePage,Manager,MemberOf,Organization,PostalCode,ScriptPath,State,StreetAddress,telephoneNumber,wWWHomePage

    		-DisplayName $userinfo.displayName `
    		–GivenName 	$userinfo.givenName `
    		-Surname 	$userinfo.sn `
    		-Initials 	($userinfo.givenName.substring(0,1) + $userinfo.mi.substring(0,1) + $userinfo.sn.substring(0,1)) `

    		-Manager $userinfo.Manager `
    		-AccountPassword $securePassphrase

However, when I run this I get an error ""New-ADUser : The name provided is not a properly formed account name"" if the -name parameter has a comma in it. Without -instance, it works fine with or without the comma.

Is there another, equally simple method to copy a ""template"" account to a new account? I don't want to have to think through all of the possible options that might be set in template unless it's really necessary...just copy over as many as possible to the new account.

My problem is that it seems like on some machines it makes the text file very quickly and then never runs the exe. Or it just runs the exe regardless of the text file being there. It's been very frustrating and I would greatly appreciate any help or advice. Please find my script below:

I am running as an enterprise admin so permissions shouldn't be an issue.  In the past I have had no issues adding the users in the child domain to the parent domain groups, but removing seems to be an entirely different thing.

I have tried two commands: Remove-ADGroupMember and Remove-ADPrincipalGroupMembership.

At the point where I am trying to remove the groups I have a list of the distinguished names of the groups and the user's AD account (from Get-ADuser) in an object. I am running the groups through a foreach loop like this:

   ""The specified account name is not a member of the group"", (It is in the group, have verified that)

      Remove-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity $User -MemberOf $_ -Server $ChildDC
I get """"Cannot find an object with identity: 'CN=Group,OU...etc' User &lt;DN of Child domain&gt;"" again

We need to grab the photo's for every user in AD and have them dumped into a folder. I can edit them easily in batches to reduce the file size from there.

What's the best way to tackle this?

Turns out that this only works if you are using Microsoft System Centre with the relevant add-ins (which we do not have). The other option is to use the following: 


    $VMManagementService = Get-WmiObject -ComputerName ""&lt;HyperVHostName&gt;"" -Namespace root\virtualization -Class Msvm_VirtualSystemManagementService 
    $SourceVm = Get-WmiObject -ComputerName ""&lt;HyperVHostName&gt;"" -Namespace root\virtualization -Query ""Select * From Msvm_ComputerSystem Where ElementName='VmToSnapshot'"" 
    $result = $VMManagementService.CreateVirtualSystemSnapshot($SourceVm) 

This doesn't work as the Virtualization namespace does not exist on the machine that I want to run the script from (and the CreateVirtualSystemSnapshot method also). It only exists on machines where HyperV is installed, and can only be installed on Server 2008. I cannot run from the Hyper-V host as it is a ""bare metal"" install, so that's a no go (although ultimately I can add it to the scheduled tasks roster on this box, if need be). 

Is there a way of using a remote machine's namespace and methods? If not, what might be a potential solution? I'm a bit of a PS newbie, so apologies if any of this is unclear or has a glaringly obvious solution.

2.Create a new file named ""c:\temp\mytarget.txt""

3.Add a few lines of text to it

4.Assign the value ""NO"" to a variable called $trigger

5.Assign an empty string to a variable called $old_len

6.Assign an empty string to a variable called $old_writetime

7.Create a while loop that will loop until $trigger is equal to ""YES""

8.Write a log entry stating that your script is starting up

9.Inside of the loop:
Check to see if the file exists; if it does not, write a log entry to your new log stating that the script is terminating with error, set $trigger equal to ""YES"", and then continue the loop
Get file information for your file using Get-ChildItem
If $old_len and $old_writetime are empty strings, set your variables equal to the Lengh and LastWriteTime properties from your object and then continue the loop
Assign the Length of your object to a new variable called $curr_len
Assign the LastWriteTime of your object to a new variable called $curr_writetime
Compare the old and current variables:
If both sets of variables are equal, then sleep the script for 5 seconds and then continue the loop
If the length variables are different, write a log entry describing your findings, sleep the script for 3 seconds and then continue the loop
If the writetime variables are different, write a log entry describing your findings, sleep the script for 3 seconds and then continue the loop

It's still a work in progress as I am currently trying to figure out the best way to do this. I am not sure if my current route will work. The line to populate the contents of the hosts file before it distributes it is as follows:

$Names = gc C:\temp\TempHosts\register_name.txt
$Storeno = gc C:\temp\TempHosts\store_no.txt
$Address = gc C:\temp\TempHosts\addresses.txt

[Just en example, I know I'll have to create a new file for each entry going forward]
foreach ($Name in $Names) { 
Add-Content C:\temp\TempHosts\hosts_temp ""127.0.0.1       localhost `r
10.0.$Storeno.1		$Name `r
10.12.13.90		APPSERVER2 `r
# DEV Reserved host name. `r
10.0.$Address.2	devmgr	DEVMGR`r""

}

I am having multiple problems with this on account of not knowing what I am doing, honestly. First off, it is pulling all stores each time I reference $Storeno so that it looks like this:

10.0.1 2 3 4.195		name1 
10.12.13.90		APPSERVER2 `r

10.0.1 2 3 4.195		name2 
10.12.13.90		APPSERVER2 `r

Rather than each line:

10.0.1.195		name1 
10.12.13.90		APPSERVER2 `r

10.0.2.195		name1 
10.12.13.90		APPSERVER2 `r

How do I go about forcing it to do an additional ""foreach"" so that it only pulls the 1 store # rather than the whole list?

Secondly, how is there a way to PS pull a row of information rather than multiple files? I I need to make sure that when it loops through the first set and comes back to the second, it doesn't start at the beginning of the file again. For example, the files would look like this:

Stores.txt
1
2
3

Names.txt
Name1
Name2
Name3

When it performs the loop, how do I make sure it doesn't do this:
1 Name1
2 Name1
3 Name1

Rather than:
1 Name1
2 Name2
3 Name3

Hopefully that all makes sense..... I feel like I wrote a novel. Thanks in advance for any help on this one.

OK, so I have an object, actually an object that contains 3 other objects, one to hold errors, one to hold warnings and one to hold information.  I pass this in and out of functions and everything works just fine until I call dsmod.  Now before you get on me for using dsmod, I am fairly sure I have to use it to set home directories in this environment.  I have beat my head against the wall using new-aduser/set-aduser, they will both fill in the information to AD but it does not apply to the user accounts when they login..  

So anyways back to my object,  when I am in the AD account creation part of the script I can step through it all the way to the end of the function and my object is my object, but the minute it is returned from the function my object contains the output of dsmod and then my object is in postion [1].  I am getting around this right now by doing $myobj = $myobj | where {$_ -notmatch ""dsmod""} but it is real hacky and I would like to figure out what I am doing wrong/not understanding.

So can anyone enlighten me or point me to some good resources to figure out wtf I am doing?

General flow

     $myobj = new-object system.object
     $errors = new-object system.object
     $warnings = new-object system.object
     $info = new-object system.object
     $myobj | add-member -type noteproperty -name ""Errors"" -value $errors
     ....
     ....

I create this custom object in a function to keep my main function clean so in my main function I call it like 

       $mainobj = create-customobj

Then I pass it in and out of functions like so 

      $mainobj = create-aduser -object $mainobj


Inside the function I use the information portion and add warnings/errors/information and then 
     
     return $Obj  

Back to the main function.
So everything works as expected in the scope of create-aduser, but once I put it back in $mainobj I now have 2 objects:  

     $mainobj[0] - Dsmod output  

     $mainobj[1] - Expected object..",,False,,t5_2qo1o,True,,,True,t3_rv5ay,http://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/rv5ay/question_about_objects/,

I wrote a process that reads the files
in and updates the attributes as expected,   but I have found that it is extremely slow.    The process that I am using is..

-Read provided file {from erp}  
-Load info for each user into a hashtable  
-  -&gt;shoot attribute to a  function {below} that reads current attribute &amp; compares to new erp value.  If different update, if not leave alone

I realize {now :) } how slow and inefficient this process is.   My biggest reason for writing it this way was for load and logging reasons.  Meaning,  each attribute is only written if there is an update.    This and if there is an error,   I would be able to see it was for a specific user/attribute.

So  assuming I scrap this methodology,   does anyone have any thoughts/suggestions on a better way to accomplish this task?

* Associate the file extension to the script
* Have the script pull the referenced file location
* Modify the registry with this new file location (for the software to open to)
* Open the original application

Would something like this work? I'm only trying to fix the file association here to actually open the file within the application and not have to manually complete this action.

I have a script that grabs a list of sqlserver instances, then connects to each (foreach), executes a query and loads the results into a table.

Every time I execute the script through a sql agent job(via cmdexec) , it only queries against 2 of the 4 servers it should. 

Its run successfully from powershell, powershell ise, starting powershell through sql server, it even runs successfully if I run it through a standard command prompt.

Please be gentle.

Here's a snippet of a script I'm writing to restore data from a lagged database copy in Exchange 2010:

$roll = Read-Host ""Enter the number of days the database should be rolled back""
$db = Read-Host ""Type the database name""
$recoverypath = ""e:\rdb""
$date = Get-Date
$time = ($date.adddays(-$roll)).tostring(""dd/mm/yyyy"")
$server = hostname
[string]$prefix = @(Get-ChildItem c:\$db | ? {$_.name -like ""*.log""})[0]

if (!(Test-Path e:)) {
    Write-Host ""A separate drive/partition has not yet been created for the Recovery Database.  Create an E: partition and re-run this script."" -ForegroundColor red
    Exit
    }

if (!(Test-Path e:\RDB)) {
    New-Item -ItemType directory -Path e:\RDB -Force
    }

Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy ""$db\$server""
Get-ChildItem c:\$db | ? {$_.name -like ""*.log"" -or $_.name -like ""*.edb""} | % {Copy-Item $_ ""e:\rdb""}
Resume-MailboxDatabaseCopy $db\$server
Get-ChildItem $recoverypath | ? {$_.LastWriteTime -gt $time -and $_.name -like ""*.log""} | Remove-Item -Confirm:$true
eseutil /r $prefix.substring(0,3) /a /d $recoverypath /l $recoverypath

$state = eseutil /mh ""c:\$db\$db.edb""
if ($state[25] -like ""*dirty*"") {
    Write-Host ""The database is dirty"" -ForegroundColor red
    Exit
    }

What I would like to be able to do is get rid of the first two Read-Host variables ($roll and $db) and replace the user prompted input with parameters in a function (with the $db variable being required).  I've tried following the examples from a few Technet and Hey, Scripting Guy! articles with no luck so far.  Basically I want to open up this functionality:

PS C:\&gt; Restore-LaggedCopy.ps1 -Database DB01 -RestoreTimeframeInDays 5
