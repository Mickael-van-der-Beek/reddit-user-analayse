The general consensus was that matchit and the like were the closest thing to that behavior.

I took it upon myself to ask stackoverflow the same question, and the question quickly gained traction. Greg Sexton recognized the usefulness of such a feature, and was kind enough to implement a ftplugin that provides this feature. [The HTML tag highlighting plugin is available here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3818).

This tip is how to speed up editing of your complex ex commands or / searches. 

If you are in normal mode hit q: to get the history window of the commands you have recently typed. Now you can navigate the command window using regular vim commands, edit a command line using normal vim editing commands. When you are done hit enter to run the current command line (the line you are on).

q/ does the same for / searches. So if you entered long complicated regular expression, you can now edit it faster using all vim's might :D.

CTRL+c gets you out of the search or command line history window (if you change your mind and don't want to re-run the command or search after all).

By the way q? also works if you are wondering (for opposite direction search history).",,False,,t5_2qhqx,False,,,True,t3_a5rex,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/a5rex/editing_your_command_line_in_vim/,

A few days ago I decided to start from scratch and just add things to my vimrc as I realized I needed them.  Today, for whatever reason I decided to start using buffers instead of windows this lead me to the internet.

6 hours later I didn't get any work done but I think I will now make up for it with all of the knowledge I have now.

My goal was to focus on more movement/usage type shortcuts rather than a full vim manual of every type of regular expression search.

Please feel free to add, I know I'm missing a few really important ones. Granted most of you probably know all these like the back of your hand, so if it helps you thats awesome but if not perhaps can help me find some good ones that I'm forgetting. 

The only thing I still plan to use is buffer shortcuts. I may also add a section at the bottom for command mode but honestly theres so many I'm not sure it would be good in this guide unless people like it and want me to add.

The main plugin I use is [vimoutliner](https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner), which has some nice features for outline-based notes. I've since modified it with some custom code to create hyperlinks (similar to the link functionality in [vimwiki](https://github.com/vim-scripts/vimwiki)) to either URLs, other text files (with the ability to specify lines with marks), or pdfs.

For my Todo list, I use a ""GTD-ish"" list, with ""Next actions"", ""Project plans"", ""Agenda"" and ""Waiting for"" for various contexts. Vimoutliner makes it very easy to add checkboxes, which I use. I move completed items under a ""DONE"" heading, then I have a perl script to ""clean out"" the file (moves all completed items into an archive file, preserving headings).

Since I use multiple computers (with different OS's) often, I have my entire notes directory controlled with git on a central server, so I can push/pull whenever I need to (plus that takes care of backup). I used to use Dropbox for that, which was a little more straightforward, but I moved off because of security concerns.

Skimming through the color schemes should be MUCH easier. A little preview window pops up when you hover over the scheme names. A click will replace the colorscheme in the current context (including any changes you've made)

The code-preview windows have been smushed into a dynamic blocky layout. This lets you get an idea of how color choices affect *everything*. I'm looking to add more languages and pieces that show vim features (spell check, ctags, whatnot). If you have a code snippet of a language not featured please send it over and I'll looking into adding it.

You can now un-set foreground a background colors.

Next I'll be looking into organizing the existing colorschemes and allowing users to share their own. I'll probably add a simple ""thumbs-up"" ranking system as well as some tags for categorizing them.

If you do wanna kick me a dollar or two to cover the shipping cost let me know and I'll give you my Paypal username or if someone can tell me how the fuck to do that with Google Wallet I'll do that

    set -o vi

I love it - but there's a problem: over the years I've formed ""muscle memory"" for the default bash (actually, readline) shortcuts:

* ""ESC-.""  will reproduce my last line's last argument
* ""Ctrl-a"" will take me to the line's beginning
* ""Ctrl-e"" will take me to the line's end
* ""Ctrl-w"" deletes the word before the cursor
* ""Ctrl-l"" clears the screen

These obviously don't work in vi-mode - ""ESC-."" for example switches to VI command mode (because of ESC) and then ""."" repeats the last inserted word.

After a bit of research, I found a way to have my cake and eat it too - this is what you need in your .bashrc:

    set -o vi
    bind -m vi-command ""."":insert-last-argument
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-l."":clear-screen
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-a."":beginning-of-line
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-e."":end-of-line
    bind -m vi-insert ""\C-w."":backward-kill-word

This way, the shortcuts I've been using for decades still work - and I can still switch to vi command mode (with ESC) and enjoy the immense powers of vi. Granted, I am losing some functionality (the repeating of a series of commands with a single '.') ; but if you are like me, you'll prefer this tradeoff.

* `[c`/`]c` for diffs, `[n`/`]n` for merges

I never really got into the habit of using text object motions such as `{`/`}` and `]]`/`[[`, since they don't seem to work consistently with the languages I use most (Ruby, JS, Bash, HTML), at least last time I checked.

It's been over a year since the [last 
time](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/o62ig/powerline_vim_statuslines_with_mode_and/), 
and during this time Powerline has been rewritten in Python and loads of 
new features have been added (shell prompts, tmux statusline, etc.) I'm 
aiming for a release pretty soon, but I'd love some feedback from you 
guys before finally bringing the plugin out of beta.

1. **Documentation.** [The docs](http://lokaltog.github.com/powerline/) 
   are fairly detailed already, but I'm only using Linux, and I'm unable 
   to write a comprehensive guide for many different configurations myself. 
   It would be awesome if you guys could help out with the docs (in 
   particular the installation and configuration guides on OS X and 
   Windows). I know that many users are still having issues even when 
   they're following the existing guides, so any corrections and 
   improvements are greatly appreciated.
2. **Third-party plugin support.** We've been having a [long discussion 
   regarding this](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/issues/3), but 
   proper third-party plugin support still haven't been implemented. In 
   this version of Powerline we won't include any third-party statuslines 
   in the main repo, but rather ask plugin authors to include Powerline 
   support in their repos. We'd love some input from other plugin authors 
   on how you would prefer to include Powerline support. See the discussion 
   on GitHub for more details.
3. **Patched fonts.** I'm hoping that we'll be able to remove the font 
   patcher soon, and instead [supplying properly patched and adjusted 
   fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts). I can't maintain 
   the powerline-fonts repo myself, so if you have a open source patched 
   font that looks good, please submit a pull request to this repo.
   Note that font patching is no longer required for most Linux users, 
   but OS X and Windows users still need patched fonts.
4. **Testing.** Since there's so many different vim configurations 
   out there, we need more testers before releasing the plugin. If you 
   think the plugin looks interesting, please consider installing it and 
   submitting any issues with the plugin to the issue tracker on GitHub: 
   https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/issues

Please let me know what you guys think about the plugin in general, and what 
could be improved. If you have any code or documentation improvements, 
please submit a pull request on GitHub: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline

http://www.rudism.com/s/vimcreep

...for me it started in Java 301 with a network poker game group project (server, hand eval, ui).  The ""professional"" programmer in our group worked with the server stuff, and there we were, 9pm, in the darkened computer lab, and I was in awe of how he moved around with vim.

I picked up vim b/c I was working as a government intern doing ASP web-dev with `notepad.exe` and got tired of having to hit the down arrow 87 lines when ASP spat back ""Syntax error, line 87"".

I've eventually moved from "":87"" to where I am today, but I love how this guy describes that sense of wonderment and discovery that I first felt when I saw vim.

I have tried to use this knowledge to my advantage many times, and have always failed.  So today I decided to try out some things, and use the :reg command to inspect the list of registers.

So, I discovered the following:

If I use dd to delete a line, the line I deleted will be in the registers.  If I keep dd'ing lines, these lines appear in order in the registers listing.

If I use de to delete a word, the word appears in the registers.  If I keep de'ing words, these words do not flow back through the registers as the text would if I was using dd.  The same appears to apply to x, c, s and other non multi-line d commands.

As an aside, one of the more common actions I'd like to make better using registers is something like this:

    [""one"", ""two""]

Say I wanna swap the above array elements.  I'd love to do it with the following actions:
delete ""one""
delete ,&lt;space&gt;
move to end of ""two""
paste the last two registers, resulting in:

    [""two"", ""one""]


So - is there some fundamental thing I'm not getting where registers are concerned?

But still, what would you change in Vim given all the time of the world? 

I'll start:

* Replace VimScript with LuaJit (or V8). Additionally, remove the Perl, Python, Ruby etc. bindings. This creates a uniform environment for scripts, and hopefully some reusable and open APIs. Currently the amount of reuse between plug-ins is absolutely minimal, especially compared to that other editor.

* The cursor is placed before or after a character, not on it! This is a pet peeve of mine. It causes craziness like the difference between a and i, p and P, ve=onemore and so on.

* Standard plug-in and package management. Vim already has a script 'repository', why not take the next step? I'm personally not very happy with initiatives that depend on external tools, especially when it involves GNU or Unix tools (that are difficult to use on other platforms).

* Background processing for some tasks. Vim is single threaded, kind of 90s. For example, I would like for FuzzyFinder to check its MRU files in the background, or run :make while I continue to edit.

I have some more (e.g. key-up and key-down events), but I think the above ones are the most important to me.

Purely hypothetical unfortunately, writing an editor like Vim is an enormous amount of work, and Bram did a fantastic job so far.

Things not really related to the language itself.

I find it hard to believe that this is a question of syntax. If you don't know common lisp, I think that you are more likely to feel at home with VimL, because it is closer to popular languages like Java and C than what ELisp is.

Possibly it could be that ELisp has some killer features that VimL lacks. But what would those be?",,False,,t5_2qhqx,False,,,True,t3_1b1g6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1b1g6y/is_elisp_really_that_much_better_than_viml/,

I am pleased to announce version 1.2, which includes the following great features:

* Fewer bugs
* External snips (described below)
* Now goes to 11

The majority of bugfixes were relatively trivial and I am pretty confident to label this release as stable. I do use it on a day-to-day basis, but my use cases are not all-encompassing.

External snips is the biggest new thing. It's basically the ability to link an external file to one of your tasks when you need to provide explanation or take notes (which I've used it for).

You set up a directory where you want snips to be saved, and then by pressing &lt;Leader&gt;tS the current task gets a snip placeholder and the snip opens in a new split (your choice of horizontal or vertical, maximized or a specific height) with the filetype of your choice (""text"" by default, but I personally use ""markdown"").

When you open your task list later on you can just press enter on the snip placeholder and the snip will open for you. It's pretty handy. In the interest of keeping Quicktask light and quick, it doesn't do anything else at all; no fancy searching in all snips or indexing or anything.

I just save my to-do list and accompanying ""snips"" folder in my Dropbox and use some switches in my .vimrc to change the path based on which environment I'm in since I use a Mac, Windows, and Linux pretty regularly.

You can check out the homepage at http://quicktask.aaronbieber.com or go straight to the github page at https://github.com/aaronbieber/quicktask.

Any and all feedback welcome. If you find a bug you can send me a message on reddit or open an issue on github.

1343708840.0,41,self.vim,xfl4b,I never understood how anyone used terminal vim until I found Lucius,dddbbb,63,22,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/xfl4b/i_never_understood_how_anyone_used_terminal_vim/,"*(I recognize that `:colorscheme` is a personal thing, so please don't think I'm pooping on your colorscheme. I'm sure those browns in popo.vim really complement each other in your eyes, but mine are wonky, so I just don't see it.)*

I've always found terminal vim to be something that's only suitable for quick commit messages or editing during a remote session. Aside from the quirks of whatever terminal emulator I was using (like ctrl-s -- which is more a lack of knowledge on my part), the colors were always so basic and ugly that I couldn't understand why you'd give up the richness of the gui.

I picked up the [Lucius colorscheme](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2536) from that ""what colorscheme is this clojure code"" reddit post, but was uninspired.

Then I fell down the rabbit hole of getting more colors in my terminal with this [vim tip](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/256_colors_in_vim) (look for the script that comes after ""to catch gnome-terminal and automatically set the TERM correctly for xterm""). After doing that, I flipped through some of my colour schemes and when I tried Lucius, **[I was impressed](http://imgur.com/Vs7e3)**.

It wasn't too stark with too much contrast in some places and not enough in others like candycode look to basic like wombat and other schemes that don't live up to their gui beauty in the terminal.

(I bet that image was a huge letdown for half the people reading. If so, have a look at [jellybeans](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2555). It's also [quite nice](http://imgur.com/qYFVR) on the terminal, but too dark for me.)

* In **insert** mode, up and down move the current line up or down in the buffer.
* In **insert** mode, left and right move the current character left or right by one character.

What do other people use their up and down arrow keys for in normal and visual mode? Anything?

For better or for worse, I learned to program right before I learned about vim, so gedit's been the editor of choice for the past two years. I've also been casually learning how to use vim for the past two years, and found a happy compromise in ViGedit--which allegedly gives vim keybindings to gedit. But tonight I lost it. I've been doing a lot of piddly work with Java files and Ant output. `yy` would've been a nice feature. ViGedit doesn't support it. Whatever, I filed a bug. Then I tried `dG`, since `99dd &lt;beep beep beep beep beep...&gt;` was getting old (my laptop beeps when it hits an error). ViGedit doesn't support it. ""Oh,"" I say. ""I'm just flicking through compiler output. Nothing major, I'll just pop this open in gVi--holy cow, everything works! And the UI stays out of my way! And...why was I using gedit again?""

Nobody in my house would appreciate my editor conversion, but I had to share it with someone. Tomorrow, I'll dig up some Java-friendly plugins to deal with indentation, file trees, etc (recommendations, anyone?). And over the next few weeks I'll figure what I have to use the GUI for, learn the ""correct"" equivalent, and then switch to the terminal.

Greetings from Emacs land.  I come in peace.  :)  I noticed that quite a few Emacs users are using VIM keybindings through evil-mode lately and claiming very high productivity.  I know some basic VI commands and use it adequately when doing sysadmin tasks without Emacs handy.

However, I have heard that once you get used to VIM, your brain can run a subprocess that subconsciously tells your fingers what to do to get editing done quickly and awesomely.  Is there a quick youtube video that can showcase this?

I've only been able to find very slow ""intro"" type videos or videos that showcase particular plugins.

Thanks a bunch, homies.

Since I didn't just want to tell them to figure it out themselves, and at the same time not just give them my own vimrc (filled with tons of personal customizations). Instead I thought I'd provide a foundation for bare functionality to the point where Vim does a little more work for you than by default. From here, they could add on whatever they want to it.

So I went through my vimrc and tried to pick out the things that I probably wouldn't be able to do without and came up with the following: (check link at bottom of post)

I might have missed a bunch of stuff so if anyone has any suggestions or modifications, please post them. I haven't really organized it much so I might also do that.

As of now I can only think of adding clipboard / pastetoggle related options so that copying and pasting between the system clipboard works nicely. Not sure if I should add mapleader, or things like smarter searching options.

long story short, you could replicate ctrlp's behavior with unite, and since unite uses [vimproc](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim) it can do asynchronous file searching.  AND it has an `-auto-preview` feature which makes it work like Sublime text.

i've been experimenting with it in my vim [distribution](https://github.com/bling/dotvim) and it's pretty amazing.  this one plugin is capable of replacing 3-4 plugins.

Of late, I find myself increasingly annoyed with gui tools. They are slow, or quirky, or unstable, or don't work cross-platform, or I just have some other reason for vague dislike (vim is low in terms of distraction for me). I'm also finding that I write a lot of code using vim and I'm getting increasingly tempted to just write my novel in vim. Therefore, I'm looking to you, the vim user community, to tell me why this idea sucks.

When I write, I typically just write as fast as I can. I turn off spellcheck during the actual writing session, and am focused at getting text on the page as fast as I am able. Each chapter has its own text file and I sometimes will bring up another text file beside the one I'm working on if I need to refer back to something. Vim seems nearly perfect for this phase of things.

I also noted some people doing screencasts where they had some sort of auto-complete feature. If I could get that working and map the keys appropriately, my muscle memory from years and years of using Visual Studio would come into play - I could get work done very quickly with this. I realize I'll still have to come back and edit, but I can use a different tool for that part if needed.

So, tell me. Why is this a bad idea? The reason I assume it is possibly a bad idea is because I don't really see many others doing this. Or if it's a good idea, what would you do to make it awesome? In particular, what would you do to your .vimrc file?",,False,,t5_2qhqx,False,,,True,t3_uwojb,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/uwojb/vim_for_writing_a_book/,

I've always had issues with the :make command behavior, namely outputting the result of the compilation and having to press enter, which not only was redundant with the quickfix window, but also necessitated an extra keystroke.

I automated this process with the following mapping:

    noremap &lt;leader&gt;m :silent! :make \| :redraw! \| :botright :cw&lt;cr&gt;

The mapping runs the compilation process silently, then opens the quickfix window if there are errors, or close it if it was already open and there are no more errors.

 * `&lt;expr&gt;` makes the right-hand side of the mapping an expression that is evaluated when the mapping triggers.

 * We are no-op if the currently active register is not the default register (`v:register == '""' ? … : 'p'`).
 * When it is the default register, we act as `pgvy`.
 * The default behaviour of `p` in visual mode would be that the selected area is replaced with the contents of the selected register. And, since they have been deleted, the contents of what was the visual area are stored into the default register.
 * Our new behaviour of `p` is that after replacing the contents, it re-selects what you have pasted (`gv`) and yanks it again (`y`).",,False,,t5_2qhqx,1342244075.0,,,True,t3_wii9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/wii9v/try_that_xnoremap_expr_p_vregisterpgvyp/,

I love the new workflow, and I have my vim set up exactly how I want it. In fact it's identical to MacVim (to those that think you can't get a beautiful color scheme/syntax on terminal vim, you're dead wrong).

But... I'm having an issue... When I open a file in terminal vim, not matter the size, there's a very noticeable pause. So much so that I'm holding off on finishing my workflow video because it's so damn annoying.

Is this a common issue? Do I need to post my .vimrc and .tmux.conf (could it be tmux that's causing it?). Going back to macvim with the same setup it opens files *blazing* fast.

**EDIT** Here's a video of the difference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK_Bydx7Dsw

As you guys can see it's not just a few milliseconds we're talking here...

**UPDATE &amp; SOLUTION**

It turns out that my slow vim was due to a plugin called: vim-css-color. Here is a quote for a github issue about this problem.

 &gt; This only applies to 256-color terminal vim, not mvim or presumably gvim. Since mvim can handle direct hex values for colors, no translation is needed and everything loads quickly. For 256-color terminals, however, the s:Xterm2rgb function is required for converting RGB values to appropriate color codes. Because it's implemented with a loop scanning all 255 colors for the closest match, and repeated ~150 times, once per e.g. s:SetNamedColor('#40E0D0','Turquoise') call, it takes awhile.

This is easily remedied by downloading and installing a fork of this plugin by another developer.

I've been using VIM for a while now, and have started looking into customising it a bit more. The things I've been missing from more fully fledged IDEs are code completion (for both the language, and the codebase in general), and the associated ability to look at appropriate documentation. 

I mostly code in Python and Javascript (+ html/css), but I tend to play around in a number of languages.

The area I have most issue with is when using a new facet of a language (eg a new module in Python). Not having code completion hugely slows down my workflow, as I have to switch to looking at docs every time I can't exactly remember what a new function is called (or, indeed, what it does).

First off, I told them that vim is not something you can learn in a day.

After much begging I agreed to see what I can do. Additionally we do in-house ""fun"" information sessions for which we get around 45 minutes. I decided this would be a good candidate.

But 45 minutes to explain vim is *extremely* short. So I am currently struggling with the selection of ""essential"" and ""cool"" things you can do with vim.

So far, as a rough outline I considered starting to explain the different modes, focusing on normal, insert and visual as they are most useful for beginners. Also explain the ""verb-noun"" nature of the vim commands. It makes many things easier to understand later on.

As a ""cool"" feature I'd like to demonstrate the following: 
 
* command repetition using the ""dot-command"".
* folding
* splits
* tabs
* macros (if there's still time)

I also want to mention ""customization"". As in my opinion, this is one of the most important topics about vim to make you feel ""at home"".

Naturally, given the short amount of time at hand, I can only scratch the surface of these topics.

I am fairly certain, that if the guys see vim in action they'll want to know more and I'll be able to give another 45 minute course. But I still want the first instance to be an all-round closed session. IOW I don't want to end with a cliffhanger like ""And next time we'll cover..."".

This is terrible for fast, iterative workflows, where even a delay of 0.5s can feel terrible.

For Python, I've used `pyflakes.vim`, but it wasn't long ago where the project was officially deprecated in favor of Syntastic.


Again, Syntastic.vim is not a bad choice, except if you get annoyed by the fact that it makes Vim wait for the external command to complete.


I had a look at [Flake8](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) (a Python flake checker that uses Pyflakes, Pep8 and a McCabe script) and though that was interesting and started looking for a Vim plugin to use it right away.


Both Vim plugins for flake8 do the same thing as Syntastic: they block.


The biggest problem with blocking is that, the bigger the file (or the more errors it has) the more you have to wait.


So I decided to make pure VimScript plugin with an asynchronous implementation that will make it seamless to edit huge files. The plugin is called [khuno.vim](https://github.com/alfredodeza/khuno.vim). Actually, the tag line for the project is *""Static code analysis for crappy Python code""*.


It already has a bunch of functionality, but for the most part, I consider the async behavior to be one of the biggest strong points of the plugin.

What makes mine different is that I came from the IDE world and tried to configure VIM to act as much like an IDE as possible.

Opening files is normally done by navigating NERDTree. Use ,h and ,l to move left and right between panels, ,q to close a buffer, ,Q to close a window.

I normally use this for developing PHP, and there are two PHP specific keybindings. Use ,p to run the file through PHP's Lint feature, or use ,P to execute the php script. Other than that, this VIM configuration works fine with all languages (assuming tagbar supports it).

I'm loving my life with vim. 
I'm no guru of the tools, hence spend sizable amount of time hunting for customizations. fell like many in to plugin mania, now following the track of many other trying to kip it simple.. this is hard ;-)
Anyway, one thing that i feel vim has a lot of power that i don't tap into enough yet is the motion options.
And i'm wandering if vim couldn't help out here.
I'm thinking what if Vim could watch every motion i make between 2 edits for examples, and prepare a set of alternatives that i could review and learn from, or even have vim replay in some slow mo to see what's happening. 
I know this is not very Vim serious user to look for this kind of things.
Well, here are some basic examples :
- before i learned the ci', i often used the visual mode then use the hjkl usual suspects to move to the other end of the ' then x the a and started typing.
- same as before, but instead of moving with the hjkl, i type instead /.'
then x, then a

there are probably smarter /worse ways perform the ci'.

What I'm looking for is if exist some kind of vim robot that could analyse our editing sessions and suggest alternative ways to do things.

Anyway, I started reading the learning vim the hard way and that's probably what anyone wanting VIM to the edit tool for evereything should go through... but sometimes a little help would be great don't you think.

As an alternative, consider first jumping to the midpoint of the line, then halving that distance either left or right, then halving again left or right until you winnow your way down to your desired position.  Much the same way binary search works to find an element in an ordered list.

As I watched them hack furiously in un-windowed Emacs and code sporadic print statements, we finally noticed something subtle -- Python could not find something to the effect of `/home/students/2012/foo/bar.py^M`. However, in Emacs, no linefeed characters were in sight.

""Why not open this in Vim,"" I suggested. At first they balked; the culture of my school's CS department is staunchly pro-Emacs and anti-Vim. They thought I was simply joking. The moment I opened the file in Vim, the problem that had plagued them for almost an hour became instantly clear -- `^M`s trailing every line. When I taught them `:%s/^V^M//` , the problem vanished before their eyes.

It is possible the settings of the version of Emacs they were running were wonky in this case, but I still succeeded in finally make them appreciate Vim in a new way. Anyone else have a story of how they raised awareness of the awesome powers of Vim to the people around them?

    someMap.insert(std::pair&lt;std::string, ENUM_TYPE&gt;(""some_string"", someValue));
about 500 times in a row. Apparently someone didn't know that the operator[] can be used for insertion. It should look like this:
    someMap[""some_string""] = someValue;
Before I learned this trick, I would record a macro and hold down the '@' key until I reached the end of the block. With ~500 lines this wasn't the best way to do it. Then I learned about the norm command. It's best to show you what I did for it to make sense:
    let @a=f""l""xdi""w""ydt)SsomeMap[""^Rx""] = ^Ry;
    ( select all 500 lines with ^V} and press : )
    '&lt;,'&gt;norm @a
BAM. All 500 lines now used the operator[] for insertion. I generated the macro for the first line and stored it into a. I represent it above as key presses. If you want I can break it down, or if it's obvious I'll just leave it as-is.

Let's see your notepad do that!

I change some stuff in the header, then move to the c file's pane, make some changes there, then save and make. Then, if there is an error in the header file, it jumps me to the error -- in the pane I'm currently in. In other words, both parts are now the header file. That's kind of silly.

Basically, I wanted to rsync a file on save and see an indicator in Powerline that something was happening and be notified of an error.

I had to recompile vim with the client server option.  Then I created a bash script to tell vim it is doing an rsync, do the rsync, and then say it was done or an error occurred.  Finally, I created a segment that checks a vim global var.

On error, the segment gets an ! at the end.

[gist](https://gist.github.com/3cooper/5698023)

Everything seems to work well.  The only issue is that sometimes the rsync is fast and it seems that powerline doesn't check the variable in time, so the indicator may never show.  I'm not sure what powerline uses for the event loop, but it seems that if I'm interacting with vim, it will happen, but if not, there is a good chance it won't.  I'm not sure if there is something I could add to my SetRsync function that would force an update.  Also, I'd like to load my error into quickfix, but I don't know how to do this.  I looked into how vim-dispatch does it, but that's a bit over my head.  I feel like I can follow the code somewhat, but I'm not sure what I have to to with makeprg and compiler to get that to happen.  I'm very new to both vimscript and python.  Maybe I do some debugging in there in the future to try to figure it out.  Thanks again for everyone's input.

EDIT:  Found :redrawstatus! to make it so the segment always shows up.  I added it to the gist.

I've been using Sublime Text 2 for about a year now, and have been using the ~~legacy~~ vintage mode for 6 months. I'm at a point where the legacy mode feels very limiting and I'm sure that switching to Vim is the answer. (Although it helped me learn basic vim shortcuts/commands.)

However, I've gotten accustomed to a couple of features, absence of which would set back my workflow quite a bit. 
Namely, 

* I need to have a similar project support (group folders together mainly for project wide search and/or fuzzy finding of files only in a project)

* jumping to function definitions in a file (in sublime text it's just @&lt;first couple of letters&gt;) 

* FTP support similar to the Sublime FTP plugin (map a folder to a remote folder completely, upload automatically on save etc.)

Other than these I think vim and some plugins got me covered. 

I know that vim has Command-T plugin that is somewhat similar to ST2's fuzzy finder, but is this plugin project/folder aware? Are there alternatives that are, perhaps?

If it's relevant, I'm working with PHP/Yii/js/HTML/CSS and some Ruby/Rails.

Recently a guy sitting next to me saw me remapping capslock to ctrl (+esc). He asked me why I would do that, given that I use vim. I started explaining how there are lots of things you can do with ctrl and it's useful to have another modifier available (certainly more useful than caps) for personal keybindings. But he cut me off with a rather angry ""NO!"" and left. I certainly don't mind having missed out on a conversation with that guy, but I'd like to know what your favourite use of the ctrl-key in vim is.

Movement via \^d and \^u comes to mind and redo (\^r) is another obvious one. A bit less known is \^k in input mode to input digraphs.

I love vim for text editing and I'm always frustrated when it comes to rendering something beautiful (I'm good with white text on black, but for some reasons my co workers expect meeting minutes, reports etc to be formatted with titles, paragraphs, colors etc...)

So far, I'm doing the bulk of text editing in vim with markdown synthax, then I use pandoc to convert to a doc and then style it in word.

Problem is, I always mess up the markdown syntax a bit and end up having too much styling to be done within word (which I'm not a big fan of)

I'd like to have a way to use my good old vim with all my nice plugins and see in another window at the same time the result of a markdown to html conversion.

I was thinking of writing a python script that would monitor the vim swap file and render some html on the fly based on the result of a markdown conversion.

Now the problem I have is:
 - How do I exactly parse the vim swap file? I haven't seen any documentation on how it's built
 - More generally is there any other way for an external program to monitor (read only) what's happenning within a vim buffer and take actions depending on it? Also, knowing where the cursor is currently at would be a huge plus as it would allow scrolling the window depending on where the cursor is on the vim buffer !


Any hint or links very much appreciated !

Give this a spin; it emulates the accent input method in Vim (specifically MacVim, due to Meta key requirement). The way to type an é in Vim is now `&lt;M-e&gt;e`, instead of the more clumsy `&lt;C-k&gt;'e`.

**BUT. What I think would be even better and intuitive, is to set line numbering to relative only when a motion is expected.**

Example: I want to yank 9 lines. As soon as I hit `y`, le linenumbering becomes relative and as soon as the command is finished, it's back to absolute. Any idea how that can be done?

This is not a plugin you should be using. This was a personal code challenge based on something I saw a user do in an emacs video, which resulted in some compact, highly-commented code by me that I felt other vimmers may wish to dig through for the learning.

**The Problem**

So I was watching an ""Emacs Rocks!"" video, trying to see what's so great about the other side of the editor war, and one thing that looked pretty cool was called ""AceJump."" You can see it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Te_a-AGqM#t=10m48s). I was sure someone would have made a version for Vim, and it turns out that the guy who made [AceJump-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AceJump) was initially inspired by two Vim plugins that do similar things, namely [EasyMotion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3526) and [PreciseJump](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3437), both of which have animated demos.

**The Challenge**

Before looking to see if there was a Vim equivalent, or to see how it worked in emacs, I decided to try to code it up myself. I've been trying to build my Vimscript skills. I got it working (took about 2 days), *then* researched, and of course found out it exists in multiple forms. No worries; it was all for the learning. I figured I'd share my code here, though. It's heavily commented for your learning enjoyment.

**The Code**

[Here it is](http://pastebin.com/vJek9vvW) (**updated**: no longer needs incorrectly-named GetASCII() function (removed - thanks to romainl for the pointer to nr2char()), and is no longer fooled by duplicate first letters). It's pretty light. I had to write a key code-to-ASCII function (is there one in Vim? I couldn't find it), but sans that block, and sans comment and blank lines, the actual work of the function is only 61 lines of Vimscript, all in a single function. Not bad.

**Description/usage**

There are 2 lines above the function to define highlights (dark gray and dark red, based on what I saw in the Emacs Rocks video), and a mapping at the bottom (`&lt;leader&gt;aj` for AceJump). Type that (or remap it), followed by a single letter. It uses the `\&lt;` beginning-of-word bound to only search for words starting with your search letter, but you can play with that.

**Caveats**

I learned after researching that the other scripts, maybe also AceJump in emacs can search internal letters as well, and if there are more than the number of jump characters results, they first group the screen into chunks of all ""a"" and ""b"" etc jumps, then after you choose one of those, it fills in all the jump characters for just that area, and you press another letter to complete the jump. That wasn't in the video I watched, and it didn't occur to me while writing it (though running out of jump characters certainly did, and is handled in my script by simply not adding jumps for those), so my version doesn't do that. It wouldn't be too hard to add. Feel free to add it yourself as a learning experience.

I also didn't think at the time of coding about using this as a motion, which the authors of the other two Vim plugins did. This is a fun area of exploration that I haven't begun to travel down. Feel free to take this down that path for the learning.

**Learnings**

`\%23l` and `\%52c` in Vim regex lock matches to line 23 and column/character 52 respectively. These are handy. I was initially using a range over `line('w0')` through `line('w$')` and `join`ing with parts of those to build up a massive regex to grey out the lines on the screen, but decided to step back and just use a for loop, which made it easier to break up the problem, store up match points, and later come back and do things to them. You can do something like `\%3c.*\%27c` to match a section on a line, or `\%10l\_.*\%20l` to match those full lines, or even `\%13l\%7c\_.*\%20l\%12c` to match a stream-select-like chunk from line/col 13,7 through line/col 20,12, but making that useful when searching internally for things like words starting with 'b' is trickier still. I gave up on that path.

To undo all the junk the script does, I just do a `normal u` at the end (which I've since learned could just be `undo`). That feels a little weird, because the script is doing a ton of things in a loop, replacing all the letters with their jump equivalents, but it seems a single undo undoes it all. Hopefully that always works. I looked a little into the undo helps, with undoj[oin] and the branch stuff, etc., but couldn't find anything very helpful. I long ago wrote into a function an undo-waypoint system, wherein I could run a waypoint function that did nothing, then call another to undo back to the previous waypoint, looking at the undo history to find it, but that was overkill for this. Suffice it to say, all of this stuff doesn't affect the undo queue (at least for me), though it does leave things in your redo.

**Feedback**

I'm curious to hear if it doesn't work for anyone. I did throw it together in two nights, and I've only tested it on my home Linux/terminal Vim setup. I could have inadvertently used features of a plugin or based on my settings that won't work for others.",,False,,t5_2qhqx,1342967706.0,,,True,t3_wy9v0,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/wy9v0/easyjumpprecisemotionace/,

1) Save a text file with this content:

    This is the first line.
    This is the second line.
    This is the third line.

2) If you do ""ggVGy"" to yank all lines and paste them with your cursor somewhere in line 2, you should get this (without the comments):

    This is the first line.
    This is the second line.
    This is the first line.    // pasted
    This is the second line.   // pasted
    This is the third line.    // pasted
    This is the third line.

The three lines were not pasted inline.

3) Now exit Vim without saving. Reopen the file in Vim. Put your cursor somewhere in line 2 and paste the lines again (they are still yanked*). This time you should get something like this:

    This is the first line.
    This is This is the first line.  // inline paste start
    This is the second line.
    This is the third line.          // inline paste end
    the second line.
    This is the third line.

Can anyone explain why this happens? And for extra karma, appreciation and thankfulness: How do I force Vim to never paste multiple lines inline?

*Edit: They are still yanked only if you happen to have something similar in your .vimrc:

    set clipboard=unnamedplus

### Some questions

* Is there a binding for copying the URL of the site you're on? I've been manually highlighting the status bar. 
* What's the fastest way to get around the same dozen sites you visit?
* Autocomplete for URLs always ranks the root domain `domain.com` behind URLs like `domain.com/profile/abba4life` even though I go to domain.com every time and have been to abba4life's profile like once. Doesn't it get this data from history? I'd prefer if the root domain was always first.

(My role is maintenance/enhancement of the framework they use to script their tests.) Lately, it's become *painfully* clear to me that most of them do not know how to get any real functionality out of their text editor. The majority of them use Notepad++ on Windows, but company-wide we have vim (7.2) installed on all the hosts that these QA developers use.

So I am considering volunteering to develop one or two one-hour tutorial sessions on using vim. To most of these users, it is a mysterious thing that they don't completely understand, but comes across as less user-friendly than Notepad++. (For example, one co-worker would hit Esc after *every* command when not in insert mode. *Every* command, other than movement.) However, I am not a vim expert. I use vim regularly, but I also use emacs (and jEdit and whatever I feel is the best tool for the file-type I am working on to be). I have a [modest vimrc](https://github.com/rjray/dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles/.vimrc), but I'll admit that there are parts of it I've cribbed from elsewhere and don't completely understand.

So I come to ask advice: If you had just one or two hours to introduce good vim practice to a mostly neophyte audience, what would you cover? Here's an summary of relevant details and goals:

* Our language for QA automation is Perl, luckily the syntax support for Perl is excellent
* Clean coding (well- and consistently-indented code) is a **major** issue with these developers, so emphasis on letting vim do a lot of that for you
* Basic vimrc content, the most common settings that they would likely want to adjust
* Efficient movement, code navigation, etc... I want them to realize the difference between a real coding tool like vim vs. Notepad++

I *don't* want to get into plugins or VimScript (yet), because I don't want to overwhelm them with too much material too quickly. Basically, I have to do peer-review on most of their code, and I'm tired of indentation all over the spectrum, inconsistent use of tabs vs. spaces, no alignment to speak of, etc. (I also plan to do a series of basic Perl sessions to drill in some better coding habits, but those I can handle.) I think that if I can get them to be better utilizers of vim (and completely off of Notepad++), that will at least be a step in the right direction.

Any and all help/advice greatly appreciated. Pointers to your favorite online tutorials, cheatsheets, etc. also greatly appreciated.

I can accomplish nearly any editing task very quickly with it, particularly popping open config files for a quick change.  That said, I still encounter a number of hurdles when using it for more heavy-duty programming.  Somebody please enlighten me as to the best way to resolve the following qualms:

1. Debugging breakpoints.  How do you use GDB effectively when it isn't integrated into the editor?  I am not interested in trying to memorize the line number of every breakpoint I might want to set every time I go to debug something.

2. Managing lots of files.  I know there are a bazillion plugins to help browse files but they all have steep learning curves and require a huge amount of custom keybinding.  Doing tons of :e and :ls is inelegant and slow.  Do you use Vim's built-in tabs, a buffer explorer plugin, a combination of those?  Would somebody be kind enough to post some .vimrc examples of keybindings so I don't have to struggle to do it myself, please?

3. Executing and testing programs.  Do you use :sh and exit, or perhaps :make with the execution as part of the makefile?  Lets hear some tips about efficiently building and executing programs.  It's hard to justify more than a few keystrokes when every IDE in the world has build &amp; run as a simple button press.

4. Tags.  What's the best way to go about using ctags?  I typically have my source files in a hierarchy of directories and using ctags involves doing a find, issuing custom commands to let vim know where the tags file is, etc.  Is there a plugin or something that will automate this and keep the tags file up to date when new code is added without me having to constantly write and execute little custom scripts?

Let me use the file_operations struct from include/linux/fs.h in linux kernel as example to explain it. [Here it is](http://pastebin.com/VhYp2WSw).

As you can see different functions have different number of of arguments. Let's say I would like to change each of these declarations into structs that contain these arguments as elements. So:

    ssize_t (*aio_read) (struct kiocb *a, const struct iovec *b, unsigned long c, loff_t d);

changes into:

    struct prefix_aio_read {
        struct kiocb *a;
        const struct iovec *b;
        unsigned long c;
        loff_t d;
    };

To achieve this I would have to break the declaration into 5 lines since there are 4 arguments, but other functions would have different number of arguments. How do I do this transition with a macro on all of these functions?

Currently what I do right now is to write the outer for loop (int i = ...), and then use visual mode to yank this, and paste it inside itself, I then use h and l to manually replace every occurrence of i to replace it with j. Is there a better way, short of using a snippets plugin?

From cygwin, I launch gvim to edit any file(s) that I am interested in. The call to gvim is wrapped in a bash/perl script. When opening FILE1 on gvim server PROJECTA, here's the behavior I desire:

1) If gvim server PROJECTA has not been started, spawn gvim server PROJECTA and open FILE1. (Default behavior)

2) If gvim server PROJECTA has been started and FILE1 is already the active buffer being edited, bring gvim server PROJECTA to the front. (Default behavior)

3) If gvim server PROJECTA has been started and FILE1 is not the active buffer or FILE1 is not in the buffer list at all, open FILE1 in a vertically split buffer. (This is the one I am having trouble with. Default behavior will not split the current window to open the new file.)

Like a normal TODO but it would trigger on certain actions like :make or :qa",leperLlama,21,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/171rvz/how_would_i_go_about_making_a_smart_comment/,"Inspired completely by [this article](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/).

Context here:

&gt; Prospective memory holds reminders to perform future actions in specific circumstances e.g. to buy milk on the way home from work (PM).

&gt;Various studies have described how developers have tried to cope with prospective memory failures. For example, developers often leave TODO comments in the code they are working on (Storey:08). A drawback of this mechanism is that there is no impetus for viewing these reminders. Instead, to force a prospective prompt, developers may intentionally leave a compile error to ensure they remember to perform a task (Parnin:10). A problem with compile errors is that they inhibit the ability to switch to another task on the same codebase. Finally, developers also do what other office workers do: leave sticky notes and emails to themselves (Parnin:10).

Important part here:

&gt; A smart reminder is reminder that can be triggered based on conditions such as a teammate checking in code, or proximity to a reminder

I've never made a vim plugin but this does seem like a good productivity booster. It seems like the best way to go would be to work with TODO text already present in comments and allow a way to specify what the triggers are.

The parts I'm not too clear about (since I've never understood a line of vimscript in my life) are:

* how do I go about checking for 'TODO' in a file upon save?
* how do I go about looking for extra options in a line beneath it (e.g. trigger on ':qa')?
* how do I then display the smart comment in its context, either in the current buffer or a new one from the bottom?

There's more I'd like to do but I imagine if I knew how to do all of that I could probably do most of everything else I wanted to do.

Here's [vim-projectroot](https://github.com/dbakker/vim-projectroot) which is a plugin which might be useful to you. It detects the project root folder of files and allows you to use that in combination with other scripts/mappings. Some mappings I've been using with it are:

    nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;dp :ProjectRootCD&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; ]f :ProjectBufNext 'F&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; [f :ProjectBufPrev 'F&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;ef :exe 'CtrlP' ProjectRootGuess(""'F"")&lt;cr&gt;
    nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;F9&gt; :ProjectRootExe NERDTreeFind&lt;cr&gt;

You're probably wondering about the `ProjectBufNext 'F`; well instead of using a filename it is also possible to reference a filemark! When you're working on a project but have a ton more buffers open it would normally be annoying to use `:bnext` to try to get to that specific buffer but not now! Just mark some file with `mF` and can use `[f` and `]f` to navigate between project buffers only. Check out the full documentation [here](https://github.com/dbakker/vim-projectroot/blob/master/doc/projectroot.txt).

However, the tool produces helpful, human-language error messages that span many lines and can vary in their form. Not so helpful for vim `errorformat`. They look something like this:

    FAILURE: Could not execute!
    
    - Where
    File '/path/to/file', line lnum
    
    - What
    Some human error message/explanation.
    &gt; error message directly from tool.
      error message format 1: column, line, error #, specific message

    - Solutions
    Suggestions about what to do differently
    
    FAILED
    
    Invocation finished on [date/time]

Not that bad - but what I learned is that vim's errorformat does not like disruptions when you start a multi-line block. I had issues with not picking up information even though if I switched from a continuation (`%C`) to a new error (`%{A,E,W,I}`), it appeared as extra errors (that is, the pattern was successfully matching).

Most examples of multi-line errorformat strings usually end with `%-G%.%#` - this tells vim to ignore non-matching lines. What I discovered is that this *breaks* the multi-line group parsing, which is why I couldn't add information to an already-declared error. The solution is to switch this to `%-C%.%#` so that these extraneous lines are added, but ignored, for the current error.

This introduces another problem: before the error is declared, and once the error is finished (with `%Z`), vim thinks these continuations mean a new error should be added. The effect is that lines before %A and after %Z are added to the clist. To fix this, add the customary `%-G%.%#` on the very end and non-multi-line messages will be completely ignored. So, this ends up looking something like (I took out the inner error format sections):

    let &amp;efm = '%AFAILURE:%.%#,%CFile\ ''%f''\,\ line\ %l,%C\&gt;\ %m,%ZFAILED,%-C%.%#,%-G%.%#'

matchit has been proposed as a next-best-thing, but it takes an extra step (pressing %). I'd like be able to see where the blocks of HTML begin and end without an extra keypress.

I've trawled the internet to find something like this for vim. Apparently, I'm not the only one, according to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2154193/using-vim-as-a-html-editor) and [nabble](http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/How-can-Vim-highlight-the-matching-tag-when-I-put-the-cursor-on-the-other-one-in-a-pair-of-tags-td1177554.html).

I've almost resigned myself to vim not being able to do this. Can /r/vim prove me wrong?

1304740582.0,15,self.vim,h5uk6,reducing vim startup time by loading only some plugins,skeept,20,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/h5uk6/reducing_vim_startup_time_by_loading_only_some/,"I have spent a lot of time trying to costumizing vim, either by tweaking my
vimrc file or by adding plugins and costumizing these plugins.
The problem is lately the startup time of vim has gone up to sometimes about
2 or 3 seconds (it has become emacs :) ).
If I am going to be editing a file for a long time this is fine but for a quick
edit to fix something this is not pleasant.

My solution now is the folowing:

define an alias:
    alias v='vim -u $HOME/.vim/simple.vim --noplugins'

simple.vim has the basic settings and loads some plugins that I feel I really 
need: 

    set nocompatible
    syntax on 
    map &lt;f4&gt; :x&lt;cr&gt;
    map &lt;f1&gt; :wa&lt;cr&gt;
    set backspace=2
    set laststatus=2

    ""load eventual plugins here (the ones that would be really necessary)
    let g:p0 = split(&amp;runtimepath, ',')[0]
    exec ""source"" . g:p0 . ""/plugin/NERD_commenter.vim""


Note that some of the plugins install files in the folder ftplugin and 
these files will be sourced when you open a file of that type.
This might result in some errors because the commands defined in these files
would have to be defined in the corresponding plugin file, which is not sourced
because of the --noplugins flag.
The solution I am using now is to use pathogen. I created a folder d in bundle
and moved the ftplugin folder to bundle/d.
In my regular vimrc file it calls pathogen so everying works file and for this
simple.vim call it also works fine.

Let me know if you have an alternative solution that might be better than this.

The thing is, I feel like I can make using vim even better, but I am not sure where to start since there are SO MANY add-ons to vim. Can anyone recommend some good add-ons/built-in vim commands that have really proved useful in their programming? I heard a little bit about ctags so I think I will check it out, but any recommendations along those lines are very much appreciated.

Just in case it matters, I do the bulk of my programming in C, but any tips about add-ons to help with Scheme, C++, vhdl, verilog and possibly python (which are all either languages I use or would like to learn) would also be useful. Thanks! 

EDIT: Thanks again for the contributions. I will look at the different things you suggested, and I hope that this post will help others who are in my same position. I just wanted to add that as far as Scheme goes, I just read about something called ""Like Slime, for vim"" which might help me in that department. 

EDIT 2:   So another thing I'd been wondering is if there is any way for vim to detect whether blocks of code surrounded by pre-processor statements are active based on the macro's definition and then maybe gray out the inactive code. I sometimes like to do the following:

#ifdef DEBUG
//code here
#endif 

It would be nice to see a visual cue whether the code would be active at the time (this of course is only just an example off the top of my head). This issue is pretty much what lead me to ctags and this broader thread question to begin with, but I wasn't able find a definite answer when I searched some time ago.

I've started a new project that aims to bring/emulate ST2 like features for Vim(MacVim currently). I've started it because I really like Vim and ST2 too. And lots of people try to emulate it. Vintage mode is not much powerful and fast like bare vim. 

But there are to much modifications some has to make in order to make vim really like st2. Thus I've included some pre-compiled binaries, plugins in order to make the experience more fluently (with the help of #vim on freenode).

Subvim has really nice features and the same shortcuts like ST2:

* `cmd + p` -&gt; Goto Anything...
* `cmd + r` -&gt; Goto Symbol on  current file...
* `cmd + k` -&gt; Show side bar 
* `cmd + /` -&gt; Toggle comment
* `cmd + [` -&gt; Indent 
* `cmd + ]` -&gt; Unindent
* `cmd + &lt;number&gt;` -&gt; Jump to tab 1, tab 2, ...
* `cmd + alt + left` -&gt; Move to next tab
* `cmd + alt + right` -&gt; Move to previous tab

and so on .. and features like:

* SublimeText like colorscheme
* On the fly ""Goto symbol, definition"" feature for 41 languages together with Go, Rust,Coffeescript, Objective-C and Markdown are supported. No need to install externalplugins or binaries.
* Full featured autocompletion via YMC. No need to compile the YCM plugin, subvim has already pre-compiled binaries included.
* Restore latest state (tab, files) when quitting and restarting again.
* Automatic closing of quotes, parenthesis, brackets and etc..
* ... many other fixes and improvements.

It's currently not finished and there are many things that needs to be implemented. It's not aimed for vim-only users. It's just a niche for people that want to migrate from st2 to vim or for people that loves vim but want sublime like editing.

Anyone who thinks it's a good project is welcome to test and contribute :)

I think there are four core bits:

* syntax highlighting
* code navigation (jump to definition, find references)
* completion
* build support (converting error messages and callstacks into quickfix locations)

For me this means:

* Getting a syntax file if (shock!) vim didn't come with one.
* ctags and cscope for almost all of my code navigation
* Finding a decent completion plugin. For languages it supports, I use the massive [eclim vim plugin](http://eclim.org/vim/python/index.html) (lets you use eclipse functionality like completion, tasks, finding files, syntax checking from within Vim). Since I already have Eclipse open for debugging, I don't mind the weight.
* I usually have to write my own compiler script to get builds working. I rarely find compiler scripts (see `:help :compiler`) and often people set them up to just check syntax instead of running from vim and parsing the callstack. Figuring out the efm is my least favourite part (I've never actually used scanf, so I haven't internalized the commands).

After I've got the basics (and I'm still enjoying working in the language), I get fancier:

* Mapping K to pull up language-specific documentation.
* Adding folding to the syntax file. (My default foldmethod is indent, which usually works, but syntax is better.)
* Interactive behavior with a [slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime) or [screen](https://github.com/ervandew/screen) plugin to inject your code in a REPL running in a screen session.
* Auto-running unit tests ([like autonose](https://github.com/gfxmonk/autonose)). These tend to be super-language specific and the most integration I would do is a compiler script for their output. Also, I don't test as much as I should.

I guess it's hard to know exactly what ex even is. I get that ed was written in a pre K&amp;R, memory-unsafe world in assembly on a PDP-11/20 by Ken, and ex was written in C in a post K&amp;R world, was memory safe, and thus had lots of plugins written for it, but there is surprisingly little historical information that I can find on ex itself. It seems really bottled in with vi. Example from the link above:

&gt;Ex is the root of a family of editors: edit, ex and vi. Ex is a superset of ed, with the most notable extension being a display editing facility. Display based editing on CRT terminals is the focus of vi.

That makes it seem like ex isn't really its own thing, but that doesn't sound right. I also know that ex was part of the Berkeley Software Distribution, and the closest I've come to an answer is a quote from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) in the history section:

&gt;...the first Berkeley Software Distribution (1BSD), which was released on March 9, 1978.[1] ... its main components were a Pascal compiler and Joy's ex line editor.

So did Bill Joy write ex, then later write vi when ex wasn't enough for him? If anyone has the gripping historical tale, please tell it!

The more sane behavior would be remaining a sidebar and loading a different buffer into the working window.

If I only have a single file (buffer) open and "":bd"", NERDTree will behave sane and stay a sidebar while a blank/new buffer occupies the working window.  The case in which I only have a single buffer open is a vast minority, however.

So far I've been tediously and annoyingly either working around or fixing the behavior when it happens, but with a tool all about speed and efficiently like VIM, having to account for this as much as I do has become mind-numbing.  It's so bad, in fact, that I would go so far as to say if there isnt a solution to this I now question the astuteness of anyone who uses VIM with NERDTree and doesn't recognize this pitfall as crippling.



**edit:**  To clarify what I mean when I say my approaches have been (unfortunately at the mercy of) ""working around"" or ""preventing"" this behavior here is what I mean:

* If I'm going along my merry efficient way and forget to work around this issue, and am left with an inane full-screen NERDTree, I can't just "":bn"" to switch to a working buffer and then ""&lt;leader&gt;n"" and expect NERDTree to fix itself.  It will simply stay broken and come back as full window when I next invoke it.  I also cannot simply "":bd"" it out of my way and expect it to return to a sane state after a fresh ""&lt;leader&gt;n"" call, I simply get a bunch of undefined variable errors the next time I invoke it.  So... what I have to do is this more convoluted and careful approach in which I *use NERDTree filesystem exploration to find a file already in the buffer and open it VIA NERDTree*. This is the only method which allows NERDTree to come back to working order itself.

* By having to always remember to work around NERDTree to avoid the breakage mentioned above, I have to perform careful additional steps when removing a file from buffer (aka when I'm using NERDTree in a project where I have to hop around files and am finished with one, which is daily).  I have to shelter its innocent little eyes by first closing NERDTree with a ""&lt;leader&gt;n"", then I can safely delete the buffer with a "":bd"" and then I can bring back NERDTree without it having lost its mind with another ""&lt;leader&gt;n"" and be back to where I wanted to be.

***tldr; If you use NERDTree to work with files in a project and try to close a buffer you're finished with, better beware, NERDTree will give you problems if you don't work around it.

How can I do that best with Vim?  
Is there a plugin for that?  
Can that be done with AWK or such too?

&gt;it.  Vim is waiting for you to type  w .  If you see another character
&gt;than  d  you typed something wrong; press  &lt;ESC&gt;  and start over.

I can't see that anywhere. I assume there must be some option to enable this (I don't know why it isn't enabled by default if it is in the tutorial, or maybe I did something wrong). I did the rest of the tutorial ""blind"", whenever I typed an operator I was careful to really type the right thing, given that nothing was displayed in Vim.

A quick lazy google search didn't help me, so I guess it will be easier to ask here. So, how do I enable this? Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qhqx,False,,,True,t3_1g2gxe,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1g2gxe/question_about_lesson_21_in_vimtutor/,

I'm doing some work to fix major bugs in the Perl runtime files before 7.4 comes out, and I've hit a bit of a snag in my work.  I'm testing the highlighting for the following Perl code:

    m{ foo{}bar };

There is a rule so that the nested braces don't end the m{...} block, but the inner closing brace has no highlighting applied.  `synstack()` reports that the inner closing brace is in the right group, but it has no highlighting for some reason.  Could anyone provide some insight as to what I could be doing wrong?

The runtime files are managed [here](https://github.com/vim-perl/vim-perl).

Thanks,

[1]  not have those automatic carriage returns

[2]  maintain line wrappage at 80 characters

and [3]  allows me to hjkl navigate based on what is visually on the screen instead of what the actual line numbers are (because the lack of carriage returns makes every paragraph a ""line"" now)

I've found an rc script that lets me do [1] and [2], but the [3] part really bothers me when I have long chunks of text and there's no easy way to navigate to the middle of them.
