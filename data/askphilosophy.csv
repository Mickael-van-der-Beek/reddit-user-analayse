Lately I've noticed a rash of people downvoting and admonishing submitters for asking questions related to their schoolwork.

I also wrote [this thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/mddju/welcome_to_askphilosophy/), the welcome page, which says, among other things: **Questions about homework are allowed here.** If that's not still the case, then the mods should update the sidebar to say so, because that sets the stage for a lot of confusion. Personally, I hope that hasn't changed, because most of the other philosophy subs are aggressive about discouraging that kind of thing and, oh yeah, it makes sense for a sub called ""AskPhilosophy"" to field all questions relating to that subject.

Besides: ultimately, it's a choice between knowing that you're helping someone with homework, or helping someone because they were clever about hiding the nature of their question and penalizing everyone else for being honest. Given my choice, I'll take the one that lets people be upfront about their motives.

The trick is to approach it correctly. Obviously, we don't want to be in the business of doing people's homework for them. The link about plagiarism is a great addition—all credit to the current mod team for that one. Another way to avoid doing a person's work for them is something that I've encouraged all along: treating philosophy as an approach rather than a series of questions and answers. That might mean giving someone the bare outlines of a philosophy and a series of references that they can follow up on to get a fuller story.

Especially for students, that usually ends up being a more helpful answer, since it gives them direction for further study. But it's also helpful for anyone serious about philosophy, since most of us are more interested in working out our own understanding and opinion than in having the whole shebang spelled out for us.

**Interested in an MA?**

1. Constructing a List

These are the only two unfunded MA programs for which it might not be insane to consider attending. Of particular note is Tufts, whose unparalleled placement record suggests the use of black magic.
&gt;* Brandeis University
&gt;* Tufts University
    
These are generally considered the top tier funded MA programs out there.
&gt;* Georgia State University
&gt;* Northern Illinois University
&gt;* University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee

These are the next tier programs, all funded.
&gt;* Texas Tech
&gt;* Texas A&amp;M
&gt;* University of Houston
&gt;* Virginia Tech
&gt;* Western Michigan

These are some Canadian MA programs, should all be funded.
&gt;* Simon Fraser University 
&gt;* Victoria
&gt;* University of Alberta
&gt;* Queen's
&gt;* Calgary
&gt;* Toronto
&gt;* Dalhousie
&gt;* University of British Columbia  

If you're interested in looking at more funded MA programs, take a look at this comprehensive [&gt;LIST&lt;](http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/grad_guide/gg12_macomp.pdf) and this continental philosophy specific [&gt;LIST&lt;](http://www.spep.org/resources/graduate-programs/ ). For the first link, look at the number under the ""Fellowships"" column. If the number there is 5 or greater, it should be an indication that the university regularly offers stipends to incoming graduate students.

1. Important Considerations

An MA's placement record and funding level are the two most important factors in choosing where to apply and where to attend an MA. Generally speaking, the funding on the MA will be tight. Some programs are more generous in comparison to cost to living, others less. But generally speaking you should be able to wing it at any of funded MA program. Just that at the tighter programs, you may have to share a place with two or three other students if saving money is of the utmost importance to you.

1. Why should I be interested in an MA?

You might be interested in an MA if,
&gt;* you were not a philosophy major (though this does not preclude you from being admitted to a PhD program)
&gt;* you need or want supplementary philosophical education before the PhD
&gt;* you want to be more competitive/attractive to PhD programs (Remarks have been made that an increasing amount of PhD students are coming in with MA's)
&gt;* you simply want to keep your options open depending on your PhD admission results. I hesitate to say MA's are a safety, because they can be just as competitive if not more so than some PhD programs. You should treat your MA applications just as seriously.

**Interested in a PhD?**

There's going to be a lot less information here. 

1. Constructing a List

I hope you have some philosophical areas that you want to specialize in. Though keep in mind a department with strong, broad interests will be an advantage at making you more well-rounded, and potentially saving you from distress if you end up changing your interests.

Use these [&gt;GENERAL&lt;](http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall.asp) rankings and [&gt;SPECIALTY&lt;](http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown.asp) rankings of philosophy programs to guide you in looking at programs. Start from the top and work your way down. Look at the department: their past course offerings, their faculty members, their graduate students and their stated interests if given, and their placement record. See if the program looks attractive to you. If it does, mark it down.

1. Important Considerations

Placement and fit (and placement again). 

**Interested in applying?**

1. Aspects of Your Application

I will address things in reverse order of importance, roughly. 

1. Transcript &amp; GRE

By this point, your grades are largely already determined. Ideally you want a 4.0 in the major. If you had problems such as a death in the family or medical illness that might have affected your grades in some way, have a letter writer address this.

For your GRE, don't blow it off. Try to do good. Back in the dark ages, the standard advice was to get a 1400 or above on the GRE. I don't know if there's a new established standard. There's a whole lot of speculation on the GRE and how it affects things. Frankly, it's not worth stressing about. Just study and get a reasonable score and don't worry about it.

1. Statement of Purpose

The importance of your SOP is almost as enigmatic as your GRE scores. But the general consensus is that fit is pretty important in how a university decides who it's going to admit, so this is your chance to make your case.

This is not a chance for you to write your autobiography about how you got or why you are interested in philosophy. 

This is a chance for you to,
&gt;* state your philosophical interests in broad strokes, and then,
&gt;* state your philosophical interests in specific, discussing the topics you are interested in, and speaking towards the work you have done already in this general area or on those topics, and then
&gt;* state how your interests align with those of the department. Give names, and maybe even examples of their work if it'd be relevant and not unnecessary. (Perhaps they wrote an article on a pretty narrow topic in Area X that you are also interested in. The admission committee might not otherwise have been cognizant that one of their colleagues had done relevant work.)

Here are three examples of successful statements of purpose: [&gt;ONE&lt;](http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/sample-statement-of-purpose.html), [&gt;TWO&lt;](http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/sample-statement-of-purpose-b.html), [&gt;THREE&lt;](http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/sample-statement-of-purpose-c.html). Here's a [&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/10/applying-to-philosophy-phd-programs_08.html) about statements of purpose.

1. Letters of Recommendation

It took me longer than it should have to connect the dots on this one. Prestige matters a lot. The first day you step foot on your university's campus, you should have already picked out the professors in your department who are well regarded in the profession and who probably have a strong publication record. You'll want to learn from them, and you'll want letters from them as their letters will carry the most amount of weight. Ceteris paribus of course though. Perhaps you did bad in one of their classes, and instead made a great connection and did great work with another professor who you know will be able to write you a very personal and strong letter.

Here's a [&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/09/applying-to-philosophy-phd-programs_20.html) and here's a [&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2007/09/advice-on-perso.html) about letters.

**Interested in enabling your post-application anxiety?**

There are two different forums you can visit. [&gt;HERE&lt;](http://forum.thegradcafe.com/forum/40-philosophy/) and [&gt;HERE&lt;](http://who-got-in.livejournal.com/).

Eventually, admission offers will start to be made. You can keep track of when programs are sending out offers [&gt;HERE&lt;](http://thegradcafe.com/survey/index.php?q=philosophy).

[Yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1hhr6s/eli5_derrida_andor_deconstruction/) someone asked for an ELI5 on Derrida. I provided the following:

&gt;Words can mean lots of different things. Sometimes when I use a word over here, it can mean one thing. But when I use it over here, it means something else! People sometimes imagine that words have only one meaning, or maybe just a handful of meanings, but they're not watching carefully enough.
Sometimes it's fun to play with words, to explore all of the different things that they can mean. By putting a word where it isn't used to being, we can make it mean something totally new, and learn something about what it usually means by looking at what changes.
And the meanings never end! You can just keep playing and playing with words, and you'll never run out of meanings. Someday, someone may come along and play with words you made, and make them mean something new again. Isn't that neat?

What I'm wondering is, what did I miss? What deep and important ideas from Derrida aren't included in this? What dimensions of deconstruction did I leave out? I know there must be some, but I can't for the life of me think what they are.

Derrida is quite far from my area of study, so please go easy on the technical jargon.

We went with various parings (doctor/lawyer, doctor/history major, successful doctor/less successful doctor) and arrived at the idea that the individual was valued strictly on what he provided his community. I was uncomfortable with this answer and wanted something more egalitarian, so I proposed playing Russian Roulette with the two victims, refusing both to base an individual's worth on his output and to pass judgment. This also allowed me to make the point that an individual's past did not dictate his future. We moved into more extreme instances (kill a murderer or a doctor?), but I held my ground and continued to let chance pick. That's when he got me: If there were a woman alone in the subway and I had to send either a serial rapist or an average guy in with her, would I still rely on fate to choose who goes? At first, I thought/hoped the situation might be too different from deciding life and death; but I realized that if fate allowed a serial rapist to live over an average guy, there would be no preventing or predicting a situation in which he would be in a subway with a lone woman. 

My discomfort arises from the contradiction I've created: I don't want to determine the value of an individual and his future through his previous actions, and yet I do seem to believe in probability and allow my decision (at least in these instances) to be based on it.

I've been interested in Nietzsche for some time now, and since I've been trying to stress objectivity, I've been looking into some criticisms of him.  I found this audio clip of Russell to be of much interest, and I think that many of you might as well.  What are your thoughts on Nietzsche's apparent misogyny?  Or his lack of compassion, believing that the suffering of many 'lesser' men (as much as a nation, even) was not worth as much as one great man?  Or how his lust for power may really be simply an outcome of fear?  My respect for Nietzsche is not what it used to be after hearing Russell's opinion.  What do you fellows think?

&gt;3.333 The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition 'F(F(fx))', in which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(f(x)) and the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of 'F(Fu)' we write '(do): F(Ou). Ou = Fu'. That disposes of Russell's paradox.

I'm going to be hosting a lecture/discussion on philosophical themes found in video games at a convention that's coming up soon. I've done this before, but it's been expanded to a two-hour format and I'm adding new material. Essentially, I will be giving a brief introduction to each topic, discussing a game or games in which it appears, and then hold a brief discussion.

Now, I was easily able to come up with *many* examples in ethics, so I'm not really looking for any of those.

But the other fields of philosophy, such as epistemology, logic, metaphysics, and their many components such as ontology and physicalism, are very difficult to find examples of.

To those of who with familiarity with games, can you cite any examples of such themes being explored or referenced in a plot? It doesn't necessarily have to be explicitly referred to. I'd very much like to expand these sections. Classic games as well as newer ones are perfectly acceptable. As I'd said, I'm looking for pretty much anything besides ethics. (Please feel free to share any ethics examples, but unless they are decidedly poignant they will likely go unused.) Other elements of philosophy, such as illustration of paradoxes, is also fine.

First, I have been wondering what, ultimately, makes life worth living? When people are normally asked this, answers are usually things like ""travel,"" ""a fine wine,"" ""the love of a good woman,"" or something else that is generally regarded as a positive thing in life. But these things are contingent, not essential, properties of life. They are encountered by some lives, but not others. What makes life, on an essential level, as a phenomena in and of itself, worth living? The act of being alive, stripped of all other contingent properties -- experiencing and interpreting sensory phenomena, occupying ontological space, making decisions that affect the future course of your life: why are these things, in and of themselves, worth it? Previous answers to this question I have received have lacked philosophical rigor and can easily be dismantled (namely because people persist in listing contingent things when I'm talking about the essential), which frustrates me. Is there any philosopher who addresses this question? 

The other dilemma that has been eating up my mind lately has been people's tendency to use and retreat into self-justifying narratives as a way to avoid harsh truths they'd rather not face. We see this all around us. People who don't bathe, dress well, and are foul-tempered will say that women don't like them because they're all shallow, stuck-up bitches. People who receive a thorough and accurate dressing down of their talent are soothed by their peers, who tell them things like ""what do they know? You're great!"" A crushing bore who interprets his partner's yawns not as an indication that it's time to shift topics or develop more diverse interests but as a sign that their partner is not smart enough to keep up in conversation with them. I'm distressed by being unable to tell when something that makes one feel better about one's self is something that is true, or is just another self-justifying narrative that hides from us real problems about ourselves. What's more, other people complicate this issue enormously, because they can't necessarily be trusted, either because they don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, or they are so blinded by their perceptions of that person that they themselves are caught up in the same self-justifying narrative and are thus unreliable for determining your true state (asshole vs. not-an-asshole, talented vs. a derivative hack, genuinely intelligent vs. pretentious poseur, etc.) I believe it's important to live life with as few illusions about yourself as possible, but I can't tell what's real and what's a self-justifying narrative I tell myself to make me feel better. Again, people have proposed answers to me, but they lack a philosophical basis and have all the believability of that banal ""co-exist"" bumper sticker.

At the beginning of the interview, Stewart says more or less ""You've shown that Kennedy wasn't a bootlegger,"" and Nasaw sort of agrees, then says, ""Well, you can never prove a negative.""

Why is this idea widespread?  The implicature seems to be that *positive* claims can be proven, but negative ones can't.  But it's just super weird for a historian, who has amassed all sorts of evidence, to say that his negative claims are somehow categorically epistemically weaker than his positive claims.  Aren't all such judgments made as best as possible on the basis of the available evidence?

So I've been trying to figure out what's the deal.  One possibility is that people who say ""You can never prove a negative"" are just acknowledging the possibility of actual but undiscovered evidence against the negative claim.  But this seems wrongheaded, since there is parity with positive claims: there's always the possibility that, for any given positive claim, there exists actual but undiscovered falsifying evidence.  

So how about this: finding no evidence that *P* (say, that JK was a bootlegger) provides *no reason to believe* that *P*, but it does not provide *reason to believe that not-P*.  I can see how this would make for a disparity between negative and positive claims.  But I'm not sure it's right.  When we have background information or auxiliary premises, as we always do, the principle looks wrong.  For example, someone deals me a card from a properly shuffled deck.  I have no evidence that it's the ace of spades, but given what I know about decks of cards I'm warranted in believing that it's not the ace of spades.

Or, more to the point, if I'm a historian doing careful work, I can probably help myself to the auxiliary premise: *if there were evidence for JK being a bootlegger, I'd almost certainly have discovered it*.  Once I add this premise to my set, it follows from my lack of evidence for the claim to having good reason to believe its negation.

I'd get it if Nasaw was just saying ""oh hey, I'm fallible in all my inferences, just like the rest of us.""  But he wasn't saying that, and he's not the only person saying ""You can never prove a negative.""

What exactly does this mean?,banquosghost,29,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/rpomu/possible_worlds_what_exactly_does_this_mean/,"I've read a lot to the effect that ""something is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds."" It came up in my reading about attributes of God and his necessary existence (a revisiting of the ontological argument). It also came up in the recent thread about modal logic in this sub. 

I see epistemological red flags flying up all over the place when I read about this, but everyone seems to take for granted that this is a reasonable argument to make. Why do we assume that any world besides the actual world is possible? I remember specifically one writer saying something to the effect of ""there is no mountain where my house stands, but there *could* be one. Hence there is a possible world in which a mountain stands where my house is."" Etc.

The fallacy seems enormous to me: Just because we can conceive of something being a certain way, doesn't mean it's actually possible for it to be that way. In order for a mountain to be ANYWHERE, there have to be the conditions of plate tectonics that would cause it to be there. In order to alter this one part of the world's features, you would have to inextricably alter the geological history of the planet, all the way back to its formation.

If we assume that things can only come about given certain conditions that bring them about, then in order to even begin to think about a certain change in the actual world we have to postulate certain conditions that brought that change about. These conditions in turn would have been caused by differences in conditions before them. We can extrapolate from there that you would have to alter the history of the physical universe in order to fit those changes into the system of conditions and causes. 

This is not to say that there is no possible universe in which such a mountain exists, but that *there is no telling what else would be different in such a universe*! Postulating a universe with just one difference makes no sense: we'd have to assume that a mountain just appeared out of nowhere.

I know that the existence of mountains is not the kind of problem that the possible worlds argument is trying to solve. I'm just using it as an illustration. I'm just wondering what the logic of possible worlds is trying to prove, and how it gets around the obvious epistemic problems of assuming worlds *could* exist that we know nothing about.

It happens most often when the philosopher is attacking an opponent's position or in debates and when somebody offers a thesis and it's supporting arguments, it seems quite solid. But then the opponent can find a problem that is simple once you listen to it, but only after you listen to it do you see it's effectiveness.

I recently took an existentialism class and it has heavily challenged my previous world view. To give you all a little context, we read selections from the following: Kierkegaard's *Repition &amp; Concluding Unscientific Postscript*, and *The Present Age*; Jasper's *Philosophy of Existence*, and *The Unconditional Imperative*;  Marcel's *Ontological Mystery*; Camus's *An Absurd Reasoning*; Merleau-Ponty's *Cogito*; Beauvoir's *Ambiguity and Freedom*; and finally Sartre's *A New Authentic Way of Being Oneself*.

I feel like throughout the class I was able to understand the majority of concepts presented in the texts, or at least the concepts we focused on. Yet the more I learned the more I felt how I felt about the world slipping away. I had strong motivation to study hard, graduate, find a corporate Software Engineering job, and make a decent amount of money. I had somehow convinced myself that by achieving these life goals I would be happy.

Now that I've taken this class I've realized how ridiculous that sounds. My motivation to try was to achieve some sort of monetary and societal status, but that seems so pointless now. I've spent so long identifying myself through my skills and what I can offer to society and others I feel like I've denied my ""authentic self"". I can't help but think that practically everything is pointless. Why should I go to classes? What's the end goal there? To learn? For what? For me? How is learning more going to help me at all? I feel like I don't know who I am or what I want to do with my life. My life feels absolutely meaningless. I've had my friends tell me I should try to do something that helps other people. Volunteer, join the peace core, teach in a third world country, fight for social change, do something that ""means"" something. But why does that ""mean"" something anymore than any other action someone takes? The end goal of that is to help support human life and improve the quality of living for others. But why? What says that anyone elses' existence will be any better or worse if I do something like that? 

I feel so overwhelmed by this realization that I've never really attached any meaning to my life or actions, and feel like there isn't any way to attach meaning to something beyond just deciding for myself what's meaningful and what isn't. But that's so arbitrary that I can't honestly believe in it, it's just something I decided I care about. But I know I made that decision, so it seems like self-deception. Every day now I feel like giving up, like life is so pointless and overwhelming and vast that I just can't deal with it. I want to disappear, I want to stop thinking. I want to feel like I matter, but I don't. I keep feeling like I just want to die so I can stop feeling all these emotions, so I can stop feeling sadness, and hopelessness. But maybe I'm looking at existentialism from the wrong point of view.

A big part of the aspiration of this community is to make the traditions and currents of philosophy accessible to redditors with little or no experience in the field. So even if you have no background in philosophy at all, feel free to take a look around and please let us know how we're doing.

Why would I want to ""ask philosophy?""
---

Well, that's the question, isn't it? Philosophy has a reputation for consisting mainly of airy abstractions and idle speculation. We at AskPhilosophy think there's a great deal more to it.

At its best, philosophy can help clarify thought, point out weaknesses in common arguments, bridge the gap between seemingly disparate topics, and illuminate foundations so basic that we may not have even recognized beforehand how much we had staked on them.

In short, the main reason you'd ""ask philosophy"" is that you want answers that aren't inclined to take the answers for granted, and that will push at the edges of your comfort zone. And if that *is* what you want, then you're in the right place.

So how does this work?
---

You ask questions; we provide answers. Not definitive answers, mind you, but answers informed by more than 2,000 years of philosophical inquiry. We're not here to proclaim our authority. We want to give you the benefit of our background, so you can decide what answers make the most sense to you.

The ""we"" in this particular case is our panel. Taking our inspiration from the AskScience model, we use flair to distinguish an informal group of volunteers who draw on their varied backgrounds to give answers that are grounded in real study and experience with the field. For more on how we maintain our panel, [read this](http://redd.it/mdane); for how we use flair, [see here](http://redd.it./mext6/).

Non-panelists are also welcome to join in on the discussion, provided that they keep their replies reasonably on-topic.

What kind of questions should I ask?
---

That's up to you. Yes, we'll field questions about formal causation in the philosophy of Aristotle, but we'd also like to try our hand at questions that you wouldn't necessarily find in a college philosophy course.

Though it may not always seem so to the layperson, the practice of philosophy is quite frequently driven by the problems of everyday life. Even the more abstract and complex branches of philosophy can be tied back to practical questions like, ""How should we behave toward one another?"" and, ""How can we know enough about the world to live well?"" Don't be afraid that your question is too simple or not philosophical enough. Even a seemingly flimsy question like ""[What is love?](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plato/p71sy/)"" can change the course of history if approached with enough philosophical seriousness.

Most of all, ask questions that are important to you. We're hoping to define AskPhilosophy less by the sort of questions that are accepted than by the sort of answers they can expect to receive.

What kind of answers can I expect?
---

Our goal is to provide answers that are informed by a study of the history of philosophy, as well as an awareness of current trends in the field. Unless you specifically ask them to speculate, the panelists are expected to ground their answers in the work of philosophers and schools that they've studied. If you find a particular answer interesting, you're encouraged to follow the citations included there and learn more yourself.

Can I ask about school assignments?
---

Sure; we don't mind helping philosophy students understand what they're studying. Just bear in mind that we're not here to do your work *for you*. We'll be glad to help out with sources, and will discuss topics with you, but don't plagiarize AskPhilosophy answers, and don't get upset if our responses look more like guidance than a cheat sheet. We're less interested in your grade than we are in making sure that you understand the subject matter.

I am constantly looking for similar experiences but also a bit lazy and easily scared when it comes to complicated texts. So what are the easy pickings in philosophy? The concepts that might not be obvious but that are easy to grasp and have the potential to change one's life?

I'm an autodidact here so my understanding of philosophy is significantly less developed than a lot of people on this subreddit, so I figured I would try and get some help with a few things. I have read Kant's *Groundwork* and feel like I have a pretty sound understanding of his theory. I plan on moving onto some existentialism this summer and was wondering if I could get some help with it.

First, and correct my ignorance if my understanding of existentialism is wrong, but the general idea of existentialism is that there is no greater categorical meaning in life, rather, it is up to the individual to determine his or her meaning for existence. My question is **are all existentialist either nihilists or moral relativists?** Also, if **Kant is a deontologist, does that mean that he believes the meaning of life is Duty?** 

I'm just trying to figure out before I delve too far into existentialism if the two theories are at all compatible. 

I would also love some suggestion on some good existentialist works. I had planned to start with Kierkegaard and then move on to Sartre, but if someone has a better idea please let me know!

It seems like he just took the genealogical method and the ideas of perspectivism and the will to power and applied them to fields like criminal punishment, psychiatry and medicine, and sexuality.

Did Foucault do anything differently, or reject/modify any of Nietzsche's ideas? I know he was influenced by de Saussure's structuralism, but where exactly is it evident in his work, or how does it change his thinking to be different from Nietzsche's?

My big suggestion is that we build a revolving panel based on the [AskScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwibi/askscience_panel_of_scientists_iv/) model. Non-panelists would still be able to give answers to questions asked here, but panelists would have flair denoting their area of expertise. Ideally, I think panelists should look at their task as that of answering questions with summaries and explanations of the philosophers they've studied, rather than with the panelists own opinions about a given topic. For example, if someone were to ask about the ethics of an omnivorous diet, panelists should generally seek to give a fair representation of what a professional or established philosophy (like Peter Singer) has to say on the matter, *before* the panelists gives their own opinion. If they can back that summary with a title that the questioner can seek out for more, so much the better. In fact, consistently failing to provide a citation should probably be one of the grounds for removing a user from the panel. A lot of the questions likely to crop up in a reddit like this will be more general than you would get in an academic setting, but I think panelists should be encouraged to address those questions constructively rather than dismissively. Consistently dismissing questions that *could* be addressed from a philosophical perspective should also be grounds for removal.

The point is this: part of the mission of AskPhilosophy should be to demonstrate to questioners the relevance of philosophy to the problems they face, and to fairly represent how philosophers throughout history have addressed similar sorts of problems. From time to time, we're probably going to get some pretty banal questions -- expect people to ask about the meaning of life -- but our response should be to tie those questions as best we can to answers from actual philosophies. Otherwise, we risk running everyone off, when we could be drawing them into more complex and rigorous philosophical thought.

AskScience is pretty strict about removing off-topic comments. Should we be that strict? Generally speaking, my preference is for a hands-off approach when it comes to comments that don't violate Reddit's hard-and-fast rules (e.g. giving out personal information), but given that the comments are very much the point of an ""Ask*Topic*"" reddit, it may make sense to moderate comments more strictly.

I don't think we should necessarily discourage people from asking for help with their assignments, but we *should* encourage them to ask for guidance rather than outright answers.

Any other suggestions? Any disagreements?

These poets, monks of unequal standing, were both disciples of the Fifth Patriarch. He declared that Yeno rightly comprehended the nature of Zen and therefore was worthy of  succeeding him. This recognition by the “master” firmly stamps the first as the orthodox expression of Zen faith. I may be reading too much into so little, but this stanza seems to breathe the spirit of nothingness. And this sentiment isn’t left unshared : the notion of Zen being nihilistic is supported by literature. One such example is The Theory of Sunyata taken from “The Philosophy and Religion of the Prajnaparamita-Sutra” (think of the scrabble score) : basically translated as the feeling of emptiness.

I am repeatedly, relentlessly harassed by this question, as of every time the subject of free will vs. Determinism comes up. And in all honesty, it is rather I that can’t understand it.

If I decide, if I make a conscious choice, more so than on my genes and experiences – which would be tools in this decision-making process – what is this choice based on so that it may be called free?

Past experiences and genes, it seems I can only reply from a limited array of answers to the question “Why did you decide thus?” Why did I pick the colour blue, or the number 387,438,165 given an unlimited amount of possible answers? It is seemingly random – despite it being truly *my* choice – for I have no a priori disposition in favour of the answers as opposed to other answers. I do not have a preference for that number, at least consciously, and yet I picked this very number.

It must then be that the final choice was based on a fundamental feature of the world – such as logic could be – a fundamental characteristic of the individual – a sort of preference of the soul, if we can call it that – or pure randomness.

In each of these cases, however, I appear no freer from determinism than with genes, if we exclude my ineptitude at predicting behavioural outcomes should the choice come from one of those three options. In each of these cases, the final choice is still not mine, but imposed by factors that simply go beyond the usual materialist deterministic answers.

Nonetheless, this leaves my misunderstanding intact, for many persons much more intelligent than I am have tackled the subject and many came to believe to free will – it must then at least be possible in a significant way. Hereby: How is free will possible?

Over the last few years I've become obsessed with trying to find a core value system that I could use to guide myself through daily life. 

I originally really got into philosophy when I read The Outsider/L'Etranger/The Stranger. It got me thinking and eventually, I left religion. I went crazy trying to find a replacement core value system but the best I could do is a combination of nihilism and utilitarianism.

I can't fully remember my original reasoning but I can't bring myself to believe that anything actually matters. But at the same time I recognize that my human bias forces me to have some sort of ""morals.""

For instance, I don't think there's a difference between a serial killer and a humanitarian but even while writing this, I wince at how hard it is to admit that. My empathy stops me from being able to treat them as equals even though I think they are. 

So even though I think that life is completely purposeless and no morality actually exists, I have a sense of morality from empathy. 

How do I reconcile these opposing views? Are there any resources on this idea?

On another note, I also think that It's impossible to have a fully coherent explanation for existence and even if humans collectively explain many different things and philosophy gets more and more complicated, none of it will ever explain our existence and is mostly pointless. Are there any resources on this idea?

1351536799.0,22,self.askphilosophy,12afsp,Questions about Stoicism. [Warning: Much reading.],JayWalken,23,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/12afsp/questions_about_stoicism_warning_much_reading/,"Hey, /r/askphilosophy. Recently, I became interested in [Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) and read [Epictetus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus)' [Discourses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_of_Epictetus) and [Enchiridion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchiridion_of_Epictetus) and am currently reading The Golden Sayings of Epictetus.

Epictetus has said the following:

* ""Freedom is secured not by the fulfilling of men's desires, but by the removal of desire.""

* ""Where is the good? In the will. Where is the evil? In the will. Where is neither of them? In those things that are independent of the will.""

* ""Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them."" (My preferred version: ""Man is troubled not by events, but by the meaning he gives them."")

However, has Epictetus said how a man is to remove his desire? Has he said how a man can cease to concern himself with what is ""independent of the will"" or how to alter his views (cease to by troubled by) on ""things"" (""events"")? If so, I am unaware.

Epictetus seems to think that the above can be achieved either by repeating the bullet-pointed quotes as maxims when appropriate or, as a result of the quotes, for a man to think the following (when appropriate):

* ""I desire X, therefore, I must cease to desire X in order to be free (from suffering).""

* ""X is independent of the will, therefore, X does not concern me.""

* ""My opinion about X is disturbing me, not X itself, therefore, I must cease to be of this opinion.""

However, oneself acknowledging that one must cease to desire X does not necessitate one ceasing to desire X. Nor does acknowledging that X does not concern oneself necessitate one no longer concerning himself with X. Nor does acknowledging that one is perturbed by one's opinion about X necessitate one ceasing to be of that opinion. An acknowledgement of the above or a repetition of maxims seems to me like a futile attempt at achieving the above. Epictetus, though, seems to me to think that a psychological revolution is to occur as a result of repeating maxims. I am very willing to admit that what seems to me is mistaken.

Then I heard the story of [Zeno of Citium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium) and it provided a possible alternative. From Wikipedia:

""Zeno was a merchant and that after surviving a shipwreck, Zeno wandered into a bookshop in Athens and was attracted to some writings about Socrates. He asked the librarian how to find such a man. In response, the librarian pointed to [Crates of Thebes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crates_of_Thebes), the most famous [Cynic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy\)) living at that time in Greece... In one incident during his tutelage with Crates, he was made to carry a pot of lentil soup around the city. After Zeno began carrying the pot, Crates smashed it with his staff, splattering the lentil soup all over his surprised student. When Zeno began to run off in embarrassment, Crates chided, ""Why run away, my little Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen you!""

The possible alternative is that what is to be achieved is to be achieved through practice, however, I have difficulty applying practice to the cessation of desire, and of opinion, and of becoming indifferent to what is independent of the will. Perhaps you, /r/askphilosophy, may know how this can be done.

Perhaps what is to be achieved is to be achieved via a compromise between, or synthesis, of, the first possibility, the theoretical, and the second, the practical, and that Epictetus thinks that what is to be achieved can be achieved through mental exercises. However, again, I have difficulty fathoming such exercises. Although, again, perhaps you, /r/askphilosophy, may know of some.

So, /r/askphilosophy, might you share with me how you think, according to Epictetus, a man is to remove his desire, cease to concern himself with what is ""independent of the will"" and how he is to alter his views?

The past two years I've just been trying to 'get by', but I'm really struggling. I am doing a dissertation this year, so a lot of independent reading is required, but I realised recently that I'm struggling to find the reading interesting (just to clarify, I find the philosophy interesting, and love the debates that we have in lectures; what I struggle with is understanding their writing styles and feel like they're not getting to the point quick enough).
My problem is that I open up the book and have no idea what the author is talking about, and my focus wavers. I have tried taking notes while reading, and will try and paraphrase each paragraph as I read, but I come away still not knowing what the general ideas were about.
Do you have any tips to help make reading easier or more interesting?
Thanks.

EDIT: To sum up what I'll do with your advice:
* If it's a long book of text (like Kant's work, or Kierkegaard's work), I'll read few synopses online, or a reading guide, first to get the gist, then read the text.
* Any text: I'll skim read through the whole chapter/section first, make a note of the flow of argument/structure, then go back and read again in detail
* If it's something I can print out / photocopy: After skimming through, highlight important bits of information.
* When I'm back at uni, meet up with others to have reading groups to discuss the texts from class.

Thanks for the help, guys! You've given me some brilliant ideas, possibly saved me from chewing my own eyes out this summer with all this reading that I have to do.

I've been asked this question before, and I've recommended two different approaches. Here's what I've said: 

If you just want a quick look at the serious analytic methodology of an accomplished professional philosopher applied to a less than typical subject, check out Harry Frankfurt's *On Bullshit*. Frankfurt is a pretty well-known philosopher at Princeton, mainly working in ethics and philosophy of mind; this book is super short — would take all of about half an hour to read, probably, and it's a good, entertaining demonstration of how a philosopher might do some basic theoretical work. 

More generally though, I think a more or less historical approach to the study of philosophy can be helpful for the beginner. With this in mind, I'd recommend reading three books: Plato's *Republic,* Descartes' *Meditations,* and Rousseau's *On the Social Contract.* Taken together, these three touch on many of the major historically important questions in political philosophy, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, epistemology, etc. They provide a great foundation for further study in either historical or contemporary philosophy.

I've also found Heidegger's description of Dasein -- an entity for whom, as part of its very being, its being is an issue for it -- useful (*Being and Time*).

I was wondering if anyone could point me to other philosophers' conception of the self. Alternatively, can anyone write a description of what the self is in an open enough way that it includes the potential to talk about selfness as expressed in life beyond just humanity?

**EDIT:** As far as eastern perceptions of self, I'm familiar with the Buddhist concept of no-self and the philosophic/religious history behind that. I was actually looking to find ideas that fit into that sort of framework as well; something that could be layered on top.

Please help me understand The Fountainhead.,NormanOrville,25,5,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1jerz7/does_ayn_rand_ignore_an_axiomatic_truth_please/,"I'm having trouble understanding the sadomasochistic relationship Howard Roark shares with Dominique Francon and why Dominique is the way she is. She's a bizarre character and wouldn't make sense but that she represents ideas... except those ideas don't make sense. The soda-masochistic relationship is a quest for self contempt. Throughout the entire book she is on a quest for self-loathing Later, discussing herself with Gail Wynand, Gail tells her of the implications of a quest for self-contempt; she doesn't have any. She has self respect whereas altruists aren't sure of themselves and are constantly searching for self-respect. That part makes sense except that self-respect and loathing is in degrees.

This is the part I don't get.

Dominique is obviously an individualist for most of the novel but during her marriage to Peter Keating she 'goes against herself' and adopts altruism that takes the shape of being utterly submissive to Keating.

This led me to question how Ayn Rand was defining altruism. My interpretation, upon reading The Fountainhead, was that altruistic behaviour is a betrayal of oneself. Ellsworth Toohey's character bio shows that Ayn Rands definition of altruism, in it's purest form, is to sacrifice ones integrity, morality, and soul for the greater good: humanity. It also assumes that it degrades the value of someone by implying they're weak enough to need you.

My problem with this is that there is a hierarchy of values and beliefs. I take it as an axiomatic truth that you can not go against your beliefs at the time of a value judgement. You can regret things. But at the time you made a judgement call the thing you value most is going to come out. Every decision requires a judgement. You will act on your beliefs. In order to act a certain way you must believe that is the best course of action for some reason... that reason is your belief. Despite the circumstances your actions are going to betray your beliefs. Even if someone is sticking a gun to your head and ordering you to kill hundreds of people with the push of a button you will make a value judgement. Even if you are a pacifist, if you hit that button to save your own life, at the time of that judgement call you believed that that choice was better than the other. This is what I would like refuted. Therefore you aren't a pacifist. That's the best I can explain it. It's circular, I know, but is it wrong? 

This is relevant to Ayn Rands philosophy because in order for her idea of altruistic behaviour to exist you must sacrifice your wants and beliefs. You must put what you personally value last. I don't agree with that. When you make that judgement call to act altruistically you make that belief your own belief therefore... sacrificing nothing. It's really enlightened self interest. 

I really hope all that made sense but if it didn't

Tl;Dr: Please explain how you can disobey your beliefs at the time of a value judgement. Explain how acting altruistically devalues people, demands that you sacrifice your integrity, and is not psychological egoism or enlightened self interest.",,False,,t5_2sc5r,1375407724.0,,,True,t3_1jerz7,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1jerz7/does_ayn_rand_ignore_an_axiomatic_truth_please/,

I want to say that it is ethical to sell your body in such was, but I want to make the comparison using porn.

 So, ""Why is porn unethical?  First I will relate porn to prostitution, as many would disagree. Prostitution is being paid to perform sexual actions with someone. Porn is two ‘actors’ being paid to perform sexual actions with each other for the sole purpose of making cash. The essential goal for both is the making of cash by use of sexual actions. ""

I'm using Aristotle to say it is unethical because there are no virtues involved in selling yourself to perform sexual acts. Nothing noble in getting sodomized or sticking in lots of different people. It essentially a desire for money by whatever means necessary, so I relate that to lacking any honor or integrity because they live for money.

Mill to say that it is ethical because what matters is happiness - pain and such. So, if porn is happier, go for it. Nothing wrong in bring pleasure to others when everyone benefits, or enough benefit to offset any negative actions.

My understanding is that Nietzsche doesn't consider himself a nihilist but rather as someone *beyond* nihilism.  He ultimately considers nihilism negatively, but nevertheless as a necessary step in the development of the individual.

It's through nihilism that the individual becomes the lion from Zarathustra, realising that values are not based on anything 'out there' (whether god or class or whatever else), thus destroying his old master.  However, the lion (nihilism) cannot create new values, and so the individual considers nothing to be of value or to matter -- a negation of life.

Nietzsche proposes that you have to move beyond the lion and become a child, forgetting the old values and thus becoming free to create your own while maintaining a recognition that these come only from within yourself.  Through this you are free to affirm life and pursue your potential.

The problem arises in that the child, which Nietsche endorses, is also endorsed by nihilists.  If this is the case then Nietzsche isn't beyond nihilism, he is just one particularly positive school of it.

I see four potential reasons for my conclusion.  a) I misunderstood Nietzsche, b) I misunderstood nihilism, c) I misunderstood both, d) Nietzsche used a different definition of nihilism from the one that many nihilists themselves use.

So my question is: which reason is correct, or is there a fifth that I haven't considered?",,False,,t5_2sc5r,1350827672.0,,,True,t3_11ucoc,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/11ucoc/nietzsche_vs_nihilism/,

This is what I think of the Tractatus so far. Mind you this is what I think is going on, and I readily concede that I could completely missing the point. Please forgive my ignorance:

1. Wittgenstein is attempting to understand the relationship between reality and language.

2. Contrary to other philosophers who deride language as a highly imperfect tool that breeds falsehood and ambiguity, Wittgenstein believes that it can actually have a close relationship with reality.

3. Language is a picture of reality, a representation of what exists. The logical structure of language, as expressed in propositions, captures the structure of reality.

4. Wittgenstein is attempting to sharply delimit what we can meaningfully talk about. 

...are any of these points correct? Am I missing something?

If I am correct, would someone mind answering my questions below?

a. Why does Wittgenstein say that mathematics &amp; logic are tautological? 

b. What is the implication of what he says in the Tractatus for aesthetic &amp; moral philosophy? Is he agreeing with the logical positivists in arguing that because these are not empirically verifiable questions, they are meaningless? 

c. What does Wittgenstein mean when he says the Tractatus is a ladder a person must use and then dispense of?

Is this a good explanation of why the later Wittgenstein thinks philosophy is confusion, or a mental knot due to attempting to frame fluid and multi-purpose words into rigid definitions?

""The meaning of a word is its use in the language"", but then we take the word out of use and try to conclude the singular abstract meaning it is intended to represent (when in fact, according to the PI, there are countless possible meanings for any word determined by the various language games that use it). Is this why Wittgenstein claims philosophy is simply confusion?

So then Wittgenstein, in the PI, claims that, when involved in a certain language game, we have an intuitive understanding (shown through social use and interaction) of the ""meaning"", or synonymously use, of its words, but any attempt to explicitly fix their meaning is misguided, because the ""meaning"", or use, of any of its words is liable to change. 

Historical philosophy has then been that language game which takes words out of their native language games, which is where they were used and therefore given their meaning, and tries to see ""whats behind them"", so to speak, which is hopeless. It's like trying to scientifically determine the meaning of a painting.

/r/askphilosophy sees a lot of the same questions. There's nothing wrong with that! It's part of our business here. Still, there are two benefits to making an FAQ.

1) It'll cut down on the time we spend writing the same posts. Instead of people posting the same questions, they can take a look at the FAQ and see if it's already answered. Instead of rewriting your answer for the whatever-th time, you can link to the relevant part of the FAQ.

2) It'll allow us to give higher-quality answers. A lot of the questions we see end up getting highly speculative answers that don't engage with the relevant literature. By compiling a list of answers that's been vetted by trustworthy members, we can do a better job of setting people off on the right foot in their education and research.

**Practical Upshot**

We first need to get together a list of questions that deserve inclusion in an FAQ. I'm thinking that for every major issue, we'll want something explaining the major positions and the basic arguments for and against the view. For major problems, we want an overview of the problem and the attempted solutions. In a reply, I'll put forward a non-exhaustive list of the questions I'd like to include. This will give you a flavor of what we're looking for.

After that, we need to work on actually doing the thing. It's easy to get excited about a project. It's hard to follow through on it. Ideally, we'd have at least two people working on every question, so that there's a bit of check-and-balance. They'd collaborate on an answer, which would then be read over by the mods to make sure it passes the bar for quality. If there is irresoluble disagreement between collaborators, the mods will make a decision using some perfectly fair system.

Citations and mini-bibliographies are welcome. The tone we're going for is somewhere between ELI5 and SEP.

**What You Can Do**

If you've got an idea for a question that should be included, post it in a top-level comment. If you want to help answer that question, put it in a reply to that comment (these can, of course, be the same comment). 

If you volunteer to help answer a question, you are expected to do the work required: collaborating to write a decent answer, citing the relevant papers or books, and submitting your answer to the mods in a reasonably-timely fashion.

I was very attracted to the ideas of Kant's Grounding of the Metaphysics of Morals as a basis for morality. My understanding of it is thus: the only applicable contruct we know exists a priori is rationality. All rational beings act the same under the same conditions. Thus rational decisions are those that are self consistent when applied to all rational beings. From here we get the categorical imperative, that rational decisions are those that can be universalized without provoking self-contradiction. Deceit cannot be universalized, as if it were, then deceit would be impossible. Morality is then just acting according to rules that are consistent with the categorical imperative and, thus, are rational.

To return to by initial question, it seems then that beings of moral worth are limited only to rational beings. While there is self-contradiction in treating rational beings as means to an end, rather than ends in themselves (if all rational beings frustrated the rationality of other rational beings, then rationality would be impossible, self-contradiction), there is as little reason to treat an animal, or even a baby, any differently than one would treat a rock.

Is there a theory that tells us how we should treat animals? Where is the dividing line between things with moral worth and things without moral worth?

However, it seems strange to use language (which, if we accept late Wittgenstein's sentiments, requires other language users) if one cannot determine whether the world and its inhabitants exist. Husserl is often accused of requiring a private language for his view to be coherent, though I think that Peter Hutcheson has argued effectively that Husserl's view can operate *as if* there were other language users to condition the rules of their language in his ""Husserl and Private Languages"". Further, Husserl's notions of intersubjectivity and the lifeworld (*Lebenswelt*) seem to assume that the phenomenal world is shared among several consciousnesses (thereby possibly allowing for public language). Do these concepts allow Husserl's phenomenological position to make use of public language? If so, would pre-*Crisis* Husserl's account (without these concepts) be able to use language publicly?

How is an anxious ape going to *concoct* the counterintuitive combination of a walking tree or an invisible banana—ideas that might indeed captivate an ape mind if only they could be presented to it?

Dennett seems to imply that, without language, we wouldn't be able to create fantasies in our mind. It's not the first time I see this line of reasoning (although I can't recall where else I've seen it) and it seems to me unjustified.

Of course, we don't (yet) have a way of testing whether language-less animals can nonetheless form abstract concepts and concoct imaginary things in their mind — but this scenario doesn't strike me as downright impossible. Since people smarter and more knowledgeable than me have implied that it is, I'm trying to understand why.

You've given me a lot to think about. I'm currently working on a (unrelated) final paper for school, but I'll be sure to respond to each of you once it's done.

I've just read Judith Jarvis Thomson's [""A Defense of Abortion""](http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/gedankenexperimente/Thomson_abortion/Thomson_abortion.pdf) [PDF, 21 pages] for the first time and am wondering if anyone might be willing to discuss her (re)definition of a ""right to life.""

For those of you who haven't read the article and do not have time to do so now, Thomson's general thrust is this:

* I. A fetus is a person;

* II. Every person has a right to life;

* III. Since every person has a right to life and a fetus is a person, every fetus has a right to life;

* IV. Therefore, abortion is not permissible because it violates a fetus' right to life.


Thomson admits that she does not actually believe the above premises to be true, but she allows I-III for arguments sake. The crux of her challenge to this traditional anti-abortionist refrain, therefore, rests on illustrating how *even if* a fetus is a person with a right to life, IV may not follow from I-III. She does this by questioning whether we are operating with an accurate understanding of what ""right to life"" really means.

On page 12 (of the PDF file linked above) she writes:

&gt; The right to life consists not in the right not to be killed, but rather in the right not to be killed unjustly.

This allows Thomson to argue that even if a fetus as a person has a right to life, the persistence of their existence might still be caused to cease via induced abortion without their right to life being violated. She uses a thought experiment to justify her point:

You are kidnapped and awake after your abduction to find you have had your circulatory system connected with that of a world famous violinist. You are the only person on the planet with the blood type he requires to live, and if he were to be disconnected from you he would die without the use of your kidneys. Now, the violinist may have a right to life (i.e. the right not to be killed unjustly), but he does not have the right to *your* kidneys (i.e. he does not have the right to those things which would allow him to persist). Therefore, if you were to unplug yourself from him and he were to die, you would have no violated his right to life because his death was not unjust: he had no right to the use of your body, and therefore you could not be accused of unjustly depriving him of it.

She also employs a story about coming down with a fatal fever. The only thing that could ever save her life would be the cold hand of [Henry Fonda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lljIrAfBzYs&amp;t=0m19s)'s brushing against her forehead. She may have a right to not die unjustly, Thomson argues, but if Fonda weren't to put his hand on her forehead he wouldn't be doing her an injustice––because she has no right to the use of his hand.

The analogy to pregnancy should be obvious: Thomson is arguing that even if a fetus *does* have a right to life, it has no right to the use of its mother's body. The fetus is in no way entitled to the thing which it needs to persist (i.e. the womb).

**My Contention**

While I do see the benefits of interpreting ""the right to life"" as meaning ""the right not to be killed unjustly""––we rarely argue that those who commit gross violations against humanity have their right to life violated if they're sentenced to death for their crimes––I also cannot seem to understand her argument when it is applied to a fetus, and thus I question whether the emendation to the right to life is justified at all.

The idea that a fetus rights against a thing who it could not exist without seems strange to me. My line of thought is as follows:

* I. The mother's body is the very source of a fetus' existence;

* II. Without the mother's body, the fetus would not exist at all;

* III. A fetus' right to life is contingent upon its existence (because rights cannot pre-exist their object);

* IV. Thomson's right to life emendation implies that fetuses have no rights to the things which are the source of its existence and continued persistence.

* V. If Thomson's right to life emendation denies a fetus' right to exist by virtue of denying its rights to the mother's body, and is therefore contradictory.

This has turned into a *much* longer post than I had anticipated, but I hope at least a few people took the time to read it over and will share their thoughts with me. Is my reasoning fundamentally flawed? Can you really deny a person the right to exist and still claim that you have not done them an injustice? I'd love to hear people's opinions, thoughts, and critiques.

How on Earth do I write a Philosophy paper/construct a valid argument?,curiousparlante,21,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1cwemd/im_used_to_writing_on_literature_and_but_new_to/,"Hello Philosophers, 

I'm in a somewhat unfamiliar situation. I'm taking an Intro to Philosophy course in my last semester of college and have been asked for the final to write an 8-10 page essay on something we've studied. The topic is open ended, but must be on the Philosophers and Philosophies we've dealt with, which include Cartesian and Kantian Epistemology as well as Utilitarian, Kantian, Aristotelian, Existentialist (Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche), Relativist (Benedict), and Egoist Ethics. 

I am more inclined to write on ethics, rather than epistemology, for I find it more accessible than epistemology. My main problem is that I'm unsure about how to create a well constructed argument on any of these thinkers without relying utterly on outside sources (of which we permitted 2-3). I lack a comprehensive understanding of any of the Philosophers and feel that I do not have the necessary Philosophical vocabulary to create a remotely convincing thesis.  

For example: 

In undergraduate literary essays we tend to address a particular text, which can be examined as an isolated work. We read the text and, with guidance from a prompt, will create an argument about the text based upon the language, motifs, imagery, etc. 

How then, for Philosophy, do I make an argument about an idea which isn't necessarily particular to one text and, if it is, generally refers or is based on the Philosopher's entire body of work? An understanding of any one of Nietzsche's ethical ideas, for example, appears to require a general conception of his entire Philosophical framework. In class this semester I've generally found that a more advanced understanding of one thinker generally leads to the realization that things are much more complex than they appear. Is there a way for a complete Philosophy noob to get around this and still create a reasonably tenable thesis? 

I am asking for guidance here. I hope this doesn't come off as a request for somebody to just write my paper for me. I intend to write it, and write as best I can, but I'm simply uncertain about how to proceed. Advice will be immensely appreciated! 

**TL;DR:** How does someone with no background in Philosophy, accustomed to writing essays on poetry and prose, approach writing an open ended ~8 page Philosophy essay?

If it is, then how it is exemplified in society today? What is the critical theory method? And how accurately do they describe ""power structures""? Does it encompass the crazy people like SRS? What is the relation of it to the idea of political correctness? What are the pros and cons for it? And is there any literature out there that can give me an unbiased look at it? And does that mean that there are no other forms of modern Marxism that deal with economic theories today? Is that as leftist as you can get?

If my definition is wrong, what the heck is it lol?

Should a person be able to make ridiculous amounts of money? (many millions or billions of dollars) Assuming they make the money because they provide a valuable good/service that is ""ethical"" and people gladly pay them.


Should they pay tax on the profits? If so how much? If the country has a low tax rate, should they look at their situation like ""pay what you want"" music pricing system?

So should someone be able to extract many billions of dollar a year if they provide at least that in benefits?

If you make money ethically, aren't you already providing benefits to society? But after you help society, you need to help it more by paying taxes? Paying what it costs the government to provide for you I understand, and maybe a bit more for a general pot, but do they have a right to make you pay for other people? I'm all for donating significantly to charities, but to be demanded that you pay a significant amount to the ""government charities""?

Flair was intended to help people who ask questions on this subreddit for a reason: it helps them know that the answers they receive come from dependable individuals with a strong background related to that field.

If you do not have flair indicating your area of expertise or level of involvement in philosophy, the people who ask questions on this subreddit are helped less and the quality of this subreddit suffers.

Being a panelist does not make one automatically more intelligent than a non-panelist, but it indicates that they have a certain level of involvement and understanding of philosophical problems that takes years to develop.

There have been many comments here from people without flair that reflect unfamiliarity with philosophical problems; give personal opinions as answers; or give dismissive, one-sentence answers. People that comment who fail to follow the guidelines and/or have not requested flair do not belong here.

If you *don't* have any level of involvement in philosophy--if you are not a professional, graduate, undergraduate, or autodidact--*please refrain from commenting*. This subreddit is not for you.

If you *do* have any level of involvement in philosophy but do not have any flair indicating your level of involvement, you must request flair.

A necessary truth is as I have seen it defined, something which must be true in any conceivable world. 

An analytic truth is something that is true based solely on its definition. 

When Quine rejected analytic truths, I have seen some resources saying that he also rejected necessary truths, and that makes perfect sense to me. If something cannot be true merely be its meaning, but must be true in reference to the wold, then it's certainly possible to imagine a world where it isn't true. For a basic example take the statement 2+2=4.

If we reject the notion that this statement can be considered true by its meaning, then I can easily imagine a world where putting a set of two things next to another set of things will result in one of them disappearing. In this world 2+2=3. Now logically that might seem impossible but if we're rejecting analytic truths then it seems that this could be applied to essentially any 'necessary' truth.

Unreason is the emotional non-directly societally beneficial aspects of human nature. This is exemplified by the vagabonds, the mystics, and the lazy.

",pinkmustard,18,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/yrbl5/given_the_epistemological_problems_of_testimony/,"Working from a brief reading of the SEP article (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/testimony-episprob/): 

""The main epistemological problem of testimony is that an enormous number of our beliefs originate in the assertions or testimony of speakers, but our accepting or believing those assertions merely on the word of the speaker does not seem sufficient for those beliefs to be justified, warranted, or knowledge.""

---- 

So, obviously, a large portion of the body of human knowledge is only accessible to most people through the testimony of others. Take physics as an example. I, personally, can't perform every experiment undertaken in physics over the past few thousand years in order to confirm whether they hold up or not, and although I could conceivably be educated enough to evaluate physics-based claims, I don't have and am not likely to gain the skills necessary to understand quantum physics, e.g.  

So, one option would be to discount all physics claims that I haven't personally verified (which would be, honestly, stupid and very limiting); or I might simply accept all physics claims as equally true (also a silly result). On the whole, though, I'm essentially left to evaluate physics claims based on the testimony of others.

Given that I am entirely or mostly dependent on the testimony of others, doesn't the character/past actions/associations of the person giving testimony provide some reasonable basis for accepting any given claim? This isn't to say that it's a perfect response to the problem of testimony--there are certainly instances where, say, a person frequently lies is actually telling the truth, etc--but if we're going to place epistemological power in the hands of people giving testimony, isn't character (a) relevant context and (b) a useful heuristic given the incredibly large body of unverifiable claims we all encounter throughout our lifetimes?

If I could re-do my undergrad, I'd be a Philosophy major. The 3 philosophy classes I took were far and away my favorites. There wasn't a text I didn't enjoy reading (even if I disagreed with the author). I loved the in-class discussions, the critical analysis of the text and looking at the methodology each author used towards making his / her claims. At the end of each class I was always left with lingering questions, something I never felt with my other courses.

I graduated three years ago, and it's only been in the last six months that I've been able to get back into what I consider a 'passionate hobby' in reading / discussing philosophy. Actually, finding the [Recommended Reading List](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/outab/an_updated_recommended_reading_list_any_thoughts/) has been an amazing guide for helping to find the avenue of philosophy I enjoy most (I seem to gravitate towards the Political / Ethical Philosophy).

Of the things I enjoy most about philosophy, the one I have not been able to re-create from college is the critical examination of the texts and methodology used by the authors. For example, I remember looking at exactly how Descartes arrived at *I think therefore I am* , what that lead to, and whether the argument holds up or falls apart under examination.  

So, here's the question: How can I do this? How can I look at a new philosophical work (John Stuart Mill's *Utilitarianism* is next on my list) and critically evaluate it? In contrast to the Descartes examination, my personal analysis has been reduced to 'I agree with A, disagree with B, and have some questions about C.' I'd love to get back to really sinking my teeth into these books, examining and evaluating them with the hope of coming away feeling more fulfilled at the end of a read.

**Full Disclosure:** I am not asking for homework help, but my motivations are still not exactly ""pure."" I am thinking about creating a new subreddit where users post interesting questions and the only responses allowed are other questions. I am also thinking about including several historical examples of this practice in the sidebar, hence my post here in /r/askphilosophy.

---

For an example of what I'm talking about, look at Jesus' response to people's questions in Luke [20:1-8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2020:1-8&amp;version=NRSV) and [Luke 20:20-26](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2020:20-26&amp;version=NRSV). 

Since there is no English word (that I know of) for responding to a question with another question, it seems the practice is sometimes called [""Socratic""](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/24852/is-there-a-word-for-answering-a-question-with-a-question) questioning in popular usage. This is obviously different from what is usually meant by Socratic questioning (check out the ""citation needed"" in the second paragraph of the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning) on Socratic questioning).

Does anyone know why the practice of answering a question with a question is sometimes called Socratic questioning? Do any examples come to mind where Socrates is alleged to have responded directly to someone's question with another question?

I am trying to collect several examples where philosophers, monks, sages, and other ""wise men"" respond to questions with another question, so if anyone knows of any other figures from Western or Eastern philosophy who are known for doing this, I would appreciate those leads as well.

The situationist critique uses results from experiemental psychology to show that people do not in fact have these character traits; evidence show that there is a lack of (cross-situational) consistency in people's actions, and thus attributions of character traits of the kind by virtue ethicists are mistaken.

I can appreciate that this is a bit of a stretch of Wittgenstein's actual work, but roll with it; the course is awful. If a question comes up regarding Wittenstein (say *Wittgenstein's language games allow religious statements to have meaning, discuss*), I'd be expected to provide some critical analysis. The problem is that this is the one part of the course which I have no idea how to criticise.

None of the textbooks present any genuinely convincing arguments against Wittgenstein. Some of them suggest that it implies an anti-realist view of religious language, one which would be shunned by believers. Whilst I agree that believers would not accept such an interpretation of their language, the extent to which their words refer to something external is in no way impacted upon by the fact that their language is only meaningful in certain contexts. The only near-decent criticism (which I believe can be attributed to Ayer) is that W's theory does not accommodate for inter-faith dialogue. 

So, my question then is whether there are any good objections that could be made to the notion that Wittgenstein's idea of language games affords religious statements meaning.

P.S. If the way I use the term 'meaning' sounds odd, it's the course's fault. It tries to lump verificationism and Wittgenstein together as if they're arguing about the same type of meaning.

But when I feel confident enough to actually share some of this knowledge in a non-academic context I might as well be speaking Neptunian.

I know that Absurdism differs from Nihilism in that while they come from the same premise - that existence has no intrinsic or ""real"" or universal meaning - Nihilism posits that meaning is nonexistent or entirely absent while Absurdism suggests that we have the ability to create our own meaning through the quest for meaning itself (Sisyphus's pushing the rock up the hill is the purpose of his life, etc.) Here's what I'm unclear on though: 

If Meursault is meant to be a sort of embodiment of Absurdism (even if he's not conscious of it) and he kills someone solely because he felt inclined to do so, does that mean that Absurdism condones such an action? I know that Absurdism rejects adherence morals/value systems based on social expectations in favor of adherence to one's own intrinsic moral compass and says that we should follow our own value systems and not society's, but in acknowledging that life has no inherent meaning and acknowledging that we have the ability to create our own meaning by pursuing meaning itself, and we recognize the importance of adhering our own individual drives and impulses over that of the illusory structure of society, shouldn't we implicitly recognize that every other person on earth is also trying to do the same? That they are on their own quest just like we are, and even if we don't respect socially imposed values or morals (like don't kill on the basis that society says it's bad) shouldn't we not kill on the basis of our own humanity, and our recognition of the humanity of everyone else on earth, and the sameness between us which lies therein?

If I had to sum this up using Camus's metaphor, I think we must imagine Sisyphus happy, but we mustn't trip Sisyphus, kick his stone away from him, or push him down the mountain. 

I ask this because while I don't know exactly what I'm going to say in my paper, I want to talk about Meursault's killing the arab as an example of how while the absurdist/existential assertion that life is meaningless and everything is a construct and blah blah blah is absolutely ""true"", that doesn't mean we have the right to act on our judgement or perception that another human no longer has the right to exist.

So I'm taking an intro to philosophy class, and we just read Apology and Crito. I liked both a lot, but I had a question.

In Apology, Socrates says that there have been times when he disobeyed what the government told him because he knew it was not right, such as when he refused to go fetch a person who the government wanted to execute.

However, in Crito, Socrates argues that one must always obey the laws of the government because of the social contract between a person and the government, and the debt that he/she owes to society. The problem seems to be that Socrates broke his own rules, at least according to what he said in Apology.

So, my question is, how does one reconcile these two views? Is it that Socrates didn't view the oligarchical government that he disobeyed as legitimate? Or that he was willing to accept the consequences of disobeying those laws, but by running from execution he wouldn't be accepting the consequences? Any input is appreciated!

I like to write, how can I best exhibit my philosophical writing, would I get accepted in a journal without a background in philosophy

I have NO plans to teach, I intend to be an entrepreneur (I was also torn between a PhD or Business School), I just feel like if a phd is paid for, and I'm still young (25), I can get it because I have a strong desire, AND perhaps it could help me politically in my native country.

For example: 

The economics profession appears to have been unaware of the long build-up to the current worldwide financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once it started to unfold. In our view, this lack of understanding is due to a misallocation of research efforts in economics. If you trace the deeper roots of this failure to the profession’s insistence on constructing models that, by design, disregard the key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets. The economics profession has failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, and even dangers of its preferred models to the public. This state of affairs makes clear the need for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, as well as for the establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the limitations and potential misuses of their models.

Accounting practices are deeply implicated in the current financial crisis and in proposals for recapitalizing financial institutions and restoring stability to the global financial system.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/sci...

Another example: 

The failure of academic finance can be considered one of the symbols of the financial crisis. Two important underlying reasons why academic finance models systematically fail to account for real-world phenomena follow directly from two conventions: (a) treating economics not as a 'true' social science (but as a branch of applied mathematics inspired by the methodology of classical physics); and (b) using economic models as if the empirical content of economic theories is not very low. Failure to understand and appreciate the inherent weaknesses of these 'conventions' had fatal consequences for the use and interpretation of key academic finance concepts and models by market practitioners and policymakers. Theoretical constructs such as the efficient markets hypothesis, rational expectations, and market completeness were too often treated as intellectual dogmas instead of (parts of) falsifiable hypotheses. The situation of capture via dominant intellectual dogmas of policymakers, investors, and business managers was made worse by sins of omission - the failure of academics to communicate the limitations of their models and to warn against (potential) misuses of their research - and sins of commission - introducing (often implicitly) ideological or biased features in research programs Hence, the deeper problem with finance concepts such as the 'efficient markets hypothesis' and 'ratex theory' is not that they are based on assumptions that are considered as not being 'realistic'. The real issue at stake with academic finance is not a quarrel about the validity of the assumption of rational behavior but the inherent semantical insufficiency of economic theories that implies a low empirical content (and a high degree of specification uncertainty). This perspective makes the scientific approach advocated by Friedman and others less straightforward. In addition, there is wide-spread failure to incorporate the key implications of economics as a social science. As response to these 'weaknesses' and challenges, five suggested principles or guidelines for future research programmes are outlined.

I tried explaining the argument as I understand it, but I am not too sure i understand the identical intensions of P.


Chalmers argument:


(1) P&amp;~Q is conceivable


(2) If P&amp;~Q is conceivable, P&amp;~Q is 1-possible.


(3) If P&amp;~Q is 1-possible, P&amp;~Q is 2-possible.


(4) If P&amp;~Q is 2-possible, materialism is false.


(5) Materialism is false.


Here P is the conjunction of all microphysical truths about the universe, specifying the fundamental features of every fundamental microphysical entity in the language of microphysics. Q is an arbitrary phenomenal truth: perhaps the truth that someone is phenomenally conscious, or perhaps the truth that a certain individual (that is, an individual satisfying a certain description) instantiates a certain phenomenal property. P&amp;~Q conjoins the former with the denial of the latter.


Source: http://consc.net/papers/2dargument.html


Chalmers needs the primary and seconday intention of P and Q to be identical. While the identical intention of Q is quite possible, there does not seem to be a difference in appearance and reality in the case of consciousness.


The identical intention of P is more problematic. Some physicalists might argue, that the primary intention of P is tied to a theoretical notion. Lets use water as an example. Then the primary intention of P is the theoretical role of water e.g. A transparent liquid, that evaporate and precipitate at certain temperatures. For Chalmers argument to succeed, the primary intention of water need to be indentical to the secondary intention. While some physicalists might hold, that the secondary intention of water, is tied to the property that actually plays the role of water, namely H20, Chalmers holds that the secondary intention of water, is whatever plays the theoretical role of water.",,False,,t5_2sc5r,False,,,True,t3_136f5x,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/136f5x/chalmers_twodimensional_argument_against/,

I am familiar with Kant's noumenal/phenomenal argument as well as the basics of Schopenhauer's World as Will and Representation (veil of Maya, etc.), both of which Nietzsche refers to explicitly in B.o.T. 

However, he seems to take for granted this idea that music is a expression of the will/noumena. I'm just guessing that the argument is articulated more fully in Schopenhauer, but I was hoping someone here could give a brief idea before I put on my gloves and dig into WWR. 

In case you'd like an idea of what I'm asking about in context, here is a passage where he makes this claim regarding music: 

&gt;""Indeed, at bottom, the relation between music and drama is precisely the opposite: **music is the real idea of the world, drama is only the reflection of this idea, its isolated shadow image**. ... However much we agitate, animate, and illuminate this form [i.e., plastic arts] from within with the greatest visibility, it still remains a mere phenomenon, from which there is no bridge leading to the true reality, to the heart of the world. But **music speaks from this heart; and no matter how many phenomena of that kind may accompany the same music, they would never exhaust its essence**, but rather always remain only its externalized copies."" 

Thanks for your insights. I'm new to Nietzsche, but so far it's been quite enjoyable and thought-provoking.

**EDIT:** *The original poster also deleted the Nietzsche passage they'd quoted from their original post. Here is is, below:*

&gt; The Genius of the Species? *The Gay Science*, #354

&gt; The problem of consciousness (or more correctly: of becoming conscious of oneself) meets us only when we begin to perceive in what measure we could dispense with it: and it is at the beginning of this perception that we are now placed by physiology and zoology (which have thus required two centuries to over take the hint thrown out in advance by Leibnitz).  For we could in fact think, feel, will, and recollect, we could likewise ""act"" in every sense of the term, and nevertheless nothing of it all need necessarily ""come into consciousness"" (as one says metaphorically).  The whole of life would be possible without its seeing itself as it were in a mirror: as in fact even at present the far greater part of our life still goes on without this mirroring, and even our thinking, feeling, volitional life as well, however painful this statement may sound to an older philosopher. 

&gt; What then is the purpose of consciousness generally, when it is in the main superfluous?  Now it seems to me, if you will hear my answer and its perhaps extravagant supposition, that the subtlety and strength of consciousness are always in proportion to the capacity for communication of a man (or an animal), the capacity for communication in its turn being in proportion to the necessity for communication: the latter not to be understood as if precisely the individual himself who is master in the art of communicating and making known his necessities would at the same time have to be most dependent upon others for his necessities seems to me however to be so in relation to whole races and successions of generations: where necessity and need have long compelled men to communicate with their fellows and understand each other rapidly and subtly, a surplus of the power and art of communication is at last acquired as if it were a fortune which had gradually accumulated, and now waited for an heir to squander it prodigally (the so called artists are these heirs in like manner the orators, preachers, and authors: all of them men who come at the end of a long succession, ""late-born"" always, in the best sense of the word, and as has been said, squanderers by their very nature). 

&gt; Granted that this observation correct, I may proceed further to the conjecture that consciousness generally has only been developed under the pressure of the necessity for communication: that from the first it has been necessary and useful only between man and man (especially between those commanding and those obeying) and has only developed in proportion to its utility.  Consciousness is properly only a connecting net work between man and man - it is only as such that it has had to develop; the recluse and wild beast species of men would not have needed it The very fact that our actions, thoughts, feelings and emotions come within the range of our consciousness at least a part of them - is the result of a terrible, prolonged ""must"" ruling man s destiny: as the most endangered animal he needed help and protection; he needed his fellows, he was obliged to express his distress, he had to know how to make himself understood and for all this he needed ""consciousness"" first of all: he had to ""know"" himself what he lacked, to ""know"" how he felt, and to "" know "" what he thought.

&gt; For, to repeat it once more, man, like every living creature, thinks unceasingly, but does not know it; the thinking which is becoming conscious of itself is only the smallest part thereof, we may say, the most superficial part, the worst part: for this conscious thinking alone is done in words, that is to say, in the symbols for communication, by means of which the origin of consciousness is revealed.  In short, the development of speech and the development of consciousness (not of reason, but of reason becoming self-conscious) go hand in hand.  Let it be further accepted that it is not only speech that serves as a bridge between man and man, but also the looks, the pressure and the gestures; our becoming conscious of our sense impressions, our power of being able to fix them, and as it were to locate them outside of ourselves, has increased in proportion as the necessity has increased for communicating them to others by means of signs.  The sign-inventing man is at the same time the man who is always more acutely self-conscious; it is only as a social animal that man has learned to become conscious of himself, he is doing so still, and doing so more and more. 

&gt; My idea is, as you can see, that consciousness does not really belong to the individual existence of man, but rather to the social and gregarious nature in him; that, as follows from this, it is only in relation to communal and gregarious utility that it is finely developed; and that consequently each of us, in spite of the best intention of understanding himself as individually as possible, and of ""knowing himself” will always just call into consciousness the non-individual in him, namely, his ""averageness""; that our thought itself is continuously as it were outvoted by the character of consciousness by the imperious ""genius of the species"" therein and is translated back into the perspective of the herd.  Fundamentally our actions are in an incomparable manner altogether personal, unique and absolutely individual there is no doubt about it; but as soon as we translate them into consciousness, they do not appear so any longer.  This is the proper phenomenalism and perspectivism as I understand it: the nature of animal consciousness involves the notion that the world of which we can become conscious is only a superficial and symbolic world, a generalised and vulgarised world; that everything which becomes conscious becomes just thereby shallow, meagre, relatively stupid, a generalisation, a symbol, a characteristic of the herd; that with the evolving of consciousness there is always combined a great, radical perversion, falsification, superficialisation, and generalisation.

&gt; Finally, the growing consciousness is a danger, and whoever lives among the most conscious Europeans knows even that it is a disease.  As may be conjectured, it is not the antithesis of subject and object with which I am here concerned: I leave that distinction to the epistemologists who have remained entangled in the toils of grammar (popular metaphysics).  It is still less the antithesis of ""thing in itself"" and phenomenon, for we do not ""know"" enough to be entitled even to make such a distinction.  Indeed, we have not any organ at all for knowledge or for ""truth"": we ""know"" (or believe, or imagine) just as much as may be of use in the interest of the human herd, the species; and even what is here called ""usefulness"" is ultimately only a belief, something fanciful and perhaps precisely the most fatal stupidity by which we shall one day perish.

The question I'm doing is about the relationship between the mass media and a democratic society. My ideas are based around the benefits and the down sides to tougher regulation on mass media and more involvement from the state.

Basically my arguments are:

* Media/government are close bed fellows

* The media can be both beneficial and detrimental to a healthy democracy

* Tougher regulation would be seen, from a liberal/libertarian perspective, as too much involvement from the state in our day to day lives

* From a Marxist perspective, more involvement from the state would be just a stronger form of indoctrination and the media would become an even greater tool for the ruling classes

* Regulation/state involvement would result in less cover ups/scandals - citing the recent Leveson Enquiry and the news of the Hillsborough cover up being brought to light

*However* allowing a media that is less regulated/totally free could be just as bad for democracy as it gives them greater power to decide what we hear about and are allowed to know. There's potential for more and greater cover ups/scandals, which would be just as bad for a healthy democracy as tighter regulation because it would result in ill-informed voters.



So, those are the ideas I've had regarding the subject. My problem is I'm struggling to pick out specific philosophers who would hold such views. Either by way of association to a school of thought or by explicitly stating their views about the mass media.

Why can Kierkegaards concept of anxiety be considered as existentialism? Because:

A) Anxiety is a fear we always have because of future problems.

B) Anxiety is always destructive and hamper us when we have to make decisions.

C) Anxiety is unavoidable if you see to your options and make your choices based on them.

Two last things before I end this: (not my life of course, haha!)

1. I have heard the ''you weren't living before you were born either, did that bother you?'' many times before, but it really just doesn't do anything to me. Before I didn't exist but now I have a life in which I can fear not existing, as stupid as that sounds. 

2. I'm an atheist and do not believe in life after death, so there is no idea of an afterlife to comfort me with. (No offense to religious people intended.)

Thanks for all of you that want to share your thoughts and experiences on this matter with me, and take care of yourselves!

My main source for interpretation was this:
http://pvspade.com/Sartre/pdf/sartre1.pdf

The most interesting ideas in his work, in my opinion, are the following:

* Because God does not exist, we can and are in fact forced to be free, even under the harshest circumstances. We must constantly navigate our way through an absurd world with limited information but total responsibility for our actions. 
* Consciousness, or ""being-for-itself"" (my namesake), is at bottom ""nothingness"" -- an empty space where sensations and judgments about the external world are focused. Being-for-itself constantly strives to become like self-sufficient, complete ""being-in-itself"", like things in the world, or like our idea of God. Being-it-itself describes inanimate and unconscious matter, which is simply there without explanation or purpose.
* Sartre rejects God (or perfection) because He would have to simultaneously be being-for-itself and being-in-itself, which is by definition impossible. For many, maybe even the vast majority of people, their goal is to be conscious but not have to bear incompleteness or the responsibility of freedom. This goal will always be frustrated according to Sartre.
* When humans strive to achieve perfection or satisfaction, they often fall into ""bad faith"". Bad faith is to be so absorbed in a role (a job, a leader, a significant other, etc.) that we lose awareness of our identity  and duty to make authentic choices for ourselves. It is self-deception -- a strange activity where a person-lied-to and the liar are somehow the same person.
* Vertigo / Anguish: similar to Kierkegaard's anxiety. Sartre describes a feeling of dizziness when we realize that we have total control over the unfolding of our lives in an absurd world. For instance, one might stand on a cliff edge and realize they don't want to fall but still morbidly think about the fact that absolutely nothing is preventing them from CHOOSING to throw themselves off and end their conscious existence.
* The Self is not a stable, coherent entity like we think, but a constantly shifting narrative that compares its contents to memories of itself, and proposes future selves. It can only exist by reference to other beings. Unlike Descartes, Sartre thinks that if the world disappeared, so would consciousness, because the observer is dependent on its relationship to what it isn't. There cannot even be a pure Cartesian thinker, because of intentionality of thought.
* all of our relationships with other people are basically just a way to feel objectified or objectify others. Even when we help others, it's very often just to reduce our own sense of guilt, or to play an expected role. When we try to objectify others, we ultimately fail because they also have the ability to choose; we cannot take away their existential freedom unless they allow us to.
* we are totally responsible for even strong emotions, like pain, fear, depression, hatred, etc. They aren't just bodily functions, but states of mind which we intentionally take on to derive meaning from events that happen to us. They aren't simply the result of Freudian urges or biological drives. We tend not to just let emotions happen, but to USE emotions as an excuse to avoid making choices that we should. I wholly disagree with this part of Sartre's thought, but it's still cool to consider.

This is my first post on Reddit so please excuse me if this is in the wrong subreddit or the title is misleading.

Next year I will be entering my Junior year in High School and am enrolled in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. A requirement for this program is to take a Theory of Knowledge class. For this class we were directed to read ""1984"" by George Orwell.

I have finished the book and part of my assignment is to write a paper answering the following prompt: ""If you could eliminate a word (or two) from the English language, what would it be, and why?""

Normally I have no problem with my homework and I am not asking anyone to answer that question, instead I have a few problems with the prompt itself. First off, if I was to remove a word such as ""pen"" would the concept or thought of what a ""pen"" is suddenly cease to exist? Are thoughts not independent of language? To me language is a way of expressing our thoughts, which exist as a concept independent of language itself.

The reason why this question is being asked is because of the concept of Newspeak found in ""1984"". Newspeak is a language used by the totalitarian government found in the novel to try and control citizens thoughts. By getting rid of such words such as ""freedom"", ""equality"", and ""justice"" the citizens will not ever revolt because they will never think of those words and thus never act on them. This language succeeds in keeping the citizens brainwashed throughout the novel.

I cannot even conceive of a possible syntax with which to translate physical systems into perceptions.  The correlation between activity in the brain and qualitative experience certainly exists, but I can't see any justification for assigning a causal relationship.

One must admit that, at the most abstract level, all physical systems are endowed with a very meager set of properties: kilograms, meters, seconds, and derived units.  Physicists are only able to deal quantitatively with measurements, any other properties of matter are merely baggage.  To say that a certain physical arrangement leads to consciousness is just that: to say it.  Every concept within the body of physics is accepted as valid not only on the grounds that it is testable, but that it is almost rigorously mathematical.  I don't see any room for qualia to supervene in any meaningful way.

If any of you have a summary of some arguments in which qualia are either integrated into the physical sciences or done away with completely I would love to read them.  If one of you has a bit more time, a devil's advocate would be greatly appreciated.

In my opinion, for prisoners not serving life sentences, it would be a must to give them access to such science. Not allowing access would be denying a prisoner medical access, considering that medical access is to try to ensure the life of a person, denying medication or surgery that could double, triple, etc. the life would be letting someone die. In contrast, it would be both cruel and unusual to force such science on anyone, especially those serving a ""life"" sentence.

I also think that sentences that are usually deemed impossible to serve, such as people sentenced to more than 100 years, ought not be changed even if the prisoner was given life extending science. Serving 300 years is certainly a huge amount of time for someone to be taken out of society, however I think it would also be necessary for prisons to provide better integration since a lot can change in 300 years. I am curious, however, how sentencing would be affected. Not only do I believe that there would be an increase of life sentences, I also think fear would spread of people serving sentences that would normally release them as an old, weak person when they can take a pill or get some surgery to become a strong, youthful citizen yet again.

I'm trying to construct my Ethics syllabus for the fall, and the way I'm drafting it is such that I'll have the undergrads (sophomores and juniors largely) reading a major ethical theory followed by a contemporary article that puts this theory into practice - preferably on a particular concrete case (which is then followed by an article critiquing the ethical theory, but that's beside the point for this question).

So, for instance, with Consequentialism we read Mills' *Utilitarianism* and some excerpts from *On Liberty* before reading Singer and Kuhse ""On Letting Handicapped Babies Die.""

Where I'm having trouble is in implementing this for deontology.  I would love to have a contemporary article using deontological principles to defend a specific ethical stance, but many of the ones I've been toying with, like Anscombe's ""Mr. Truman's Degree"" or Nagel's ""War and Massacre"" just end up feeling more like criticisms of consequentialism than thorough explorations of deontology.

The action of killing 10 men has now taken place, and there is now no way to know what would have happened if the men were to have lived. It's plausible to suggest that the gang wars wouldn't have occurred at all, and the killing of the men may have been completely unnecessary. Therefore it could perhaps be suggested that the more right action to have chosen would be to have let the men live.

Can the action of killing the men still be seen as right given that other actions may have led to an arguably more 'right' outcome? Can we only ever be under the illusion of making the correct choice, yet not truly know how other chosen events may have unfolded?

The implications of this, for me at least, seems rather depressing. You can never know if you did the right thing as its impossible to view the opposite outcome.

This question stems from a discussion (read: argument) I was having a while ago with an anarchist/libertarian. Specifically, we were talking about anti-discrimination laws and whether businesses should be allowed to discriminate against minorities or women. He was saying that these laws infringed on peoples freedom, and if a business wanted to discriminate they should be allowed to do so (and people could patronize other businesses).

I pointed out that he was a white male, and that as such, the chances of him being negatively discriminated against in the western world were tiny. I was then told that I was using the ad hominem fallacy, specifically the Circumstantial form of it.

My question: Was I in fact guilty of it? I feel like it's not wrong to point out certain facts that might predispose you to support a certain side in a debate. It's easy to be against anti-discrimination laws when repealing them won't really hurt you.

It says:

* If a Maximally Great Being exists in one possible world, it exists in all possible worlds.
* A Maximally Great Being exists in one possible world.
* Therefore a Maximally Great Being exists in all possible worlds.
* Therefore a Maximally Great Being exists in our world.

Examining ""Maximally Great Being"", we see:

* A being is Maximally Great if it is Maximally Good in all possible worlds.

Replacing the symbol with the substance, we get:

* If a Maximally Good Being that exists in all possible worlds exists in one possible world, it exists in all possible worlds.
* A Maximally Good Being that exists in all possible worlds exists in one possible world.
* Therefore a Maximally Good Being that exists in all possible worlds exists in all possible worlds.
* Therefore a Maximally Good Being that exists in all possible worlds exists in our world.

This seems to be begging the question of whether a Maximally Good Being exists in our world. But
there seem to be philosophers who think well of this argument. If it had such an obvious flaw, I
would think philosophers would generally reject it out of hand.

The places where my understanding might be breaking down are, in order of decreasing likelihood:

* Misunderstanding Plantinga's argument
* Wrongly thinking that this argument is well respected among philosophers
* Something I haven't thought of

Let's take this example from theoryofknowledge.info.

&gt;Suppose that two students, Mark and Sam, have taken a test. Mark is a straight A student, while Sam consistently fails any work he is set. Mark has attended the lessons in preparation for the test, while Sam has been absent due to illness. Mark revised hard for the test, while Sam stayed out all night at a party. Mark wrote furiously for the full duration of the test, while Sam wrote a few lines and then walked out in disgust. Mark says that the test went well, while Sam says that he didn’t even understand the question.

&gt;Reflecting on the test, and on a book that he has recently been reading, Sam forms the following belief: the student that will get the highest grade on the test shares a name with the author of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.” Sam clearly has excellent evidence for this belief, he is justified in believing it; he has excellent evidence that Mark will get the highest grade on the test, and can see from the cover of his copy of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn that it was written by Mark Twain. Furthermore, the belief is true; the student that will get the highest grade on the test does indeed share a name with the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.” According to the tripartite theory of knowledge, therefore, Sam knows that the student that will get the highest grade on the test shares a name with the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”

&gt;Sam, however, does not know this. Mark, despite his excellent grades in the past, perfect attendance, hours of revision, furious writing, and confidence, failed the test. He did not appreciate the subtlety of the question, and so missed its point entirely. Sam, on the other hand, despite his previous poor grades, frequent absences, late night partying, and pessimism concerning his performance, did understand the question. In the few lines that he wrote he managed to scrape a passing grade. Sam, therefore, rather than Mark, got the highest grade on the test.
Unknown to Sam, though, he does share a name with the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.” Its author, who used the pseudonym Mark Twain, was in fact called Samuel Clemens. Sam, therefore, who is the student who will get the highest grade on the test, does share a name with the author of Huckleberry Finn.

What I don't get, is that the justification for this comes from a different truth, which in turn is based on a false justification (that Mark will pass the truth, which is the justification for believing he who shares a name with the author of the book will get the best mark). The new truth which the TTK supposedly counts as knowledge (that Sam 'knew' the one with the shared name would do better) is based purely off coincidence over the fact that the justification was for a different truth but happened to justify the relevant truth.

Nietzsche is known for his constant self-contradictions, but this one really stands out form the rest.

In the book 'Beyond good and Evil', Nietzsche makes a distinction between two types of moralty: morality of the slave and morality of the lord. The slaves form some kind of herd-mentality and create (or make up) some kind of absolute defenitions of the concepts of 'good' and 'evil'. 

The lords on the other hand, generate strength and morality from their individual selves. They do not define absolute concepts because they are themselves indefinable, so they create the subjectivistic distinction between 'good' and 'bad'. 

Allright. At the end of the book, Nietzsche defines his own thoughts as 'bad'. what does he mean by this? Why are his thoughts bad? Is he postulating himself als a constant chaos of the 'will to power' which battles him as a person?.. but then he is no actual person and he can't  judge about his thoughts...But he does. Why would he take this position towads (a part of) himself? His thoughs seem to be in line with the moral perspective of the lords, so why would it be bad? It is terribly confusing.

Thank you all for the thoughtful replies.

Hello everyone,

I was helping a student with a paper for her Introduction to Ethics course, and they had to choose a topic that fit with their majors. She chose cochlear implants because she is a speech pathology major, and this topic is quite large and worthy of consideration. The major problem is: should parents be allowed to force their deaf children to receive cochlear implants at a young age? I think this question will provide an interesting discussion.

Those who say yes basically make the claim that having (even minimal) hearing is objectively better than being deaf. I am inclined to agree, but something about this seems prejudiced against those with disabilities. Further, it allows hearing parents to communicate with their children more effectively if they are both familiar with the same language. This point seems arguable, however, because parents can still (and possibly should) learn sign language.

I think I disagree with this position, however. There are three reasons why: first, the learning processes of deaf children are largely receptive to visual stimuli rather than auditory stimuli (obviously). This makes it difficult for them to transition to learning through hearing which seriously damages their language acquisition. This, in turn, also sets back their overall ability to learn about any topic (mathematics, history, art, science, etc.).

Second, forcing deaf children to receive cochlear implants does not allow them to make a decision for themselves and robs the deaf community of a participant. It can be argued, of course, that the child is nowhere near capable of making that decision, but I think the outcomes are adequately problematic to warrant against making the decision *for* them. Likewise, the deaf community has a rich culture and language that is ever shrinking with such technological advancements. This might be a good thing if hearing is objectively better than not hearing, but something about it just seems wrong to me.

Third, when the child gets older (usually in adolescence) he or she will undergo a sort of existential crisis where he or she unsure whether he or she belongs in the deaf or hearing community. The person is technically able to hear, but his or her learning disabilities that result will cause stigma against that person from hearing communities. Similarly, because he or she can hear, he or she is alienated from the deaf community and may not have even learned sign-language. Thus, he or she may feel socially isolated which can lead to further problematic consequences.

Overall, these reasons seem to build an adequate case against forcing children to receive cochlear implants, but I'm very interested to see other opinions on the matter. And is there a medical-ethics principle (similar to paternalism) that applies in this instance?

I should likely preface this question by noting that my experience with philosophy extends no further than an intro-level college course that I mostly slept through, and that therefore, this question is likely almost insultingly simple. You've been duly warned, I suppose.

So, my question is as above: have any modern, well-respected philosophers argued for a universal moral or ethical standard? If I understand correctly, relativism, both as regards morality and meta-ethics, has almost entirely superseded moral universalism in modern philosophy. Being an atheist, and thus more or less contractually obligated to disavow any kind of non-humanistically-grounded (which I suppose is just an inelegant way to say ""universalist"") construct, but also an admirer of Enlightenment thought, at least on an emotional level, this leaves me in a somewhat sticky position philosophically. Could anyone point me to where I might start to read up on the subject? Certainly I'm not only interested in reading things that agree with my point of view (though doing so might assuage the cognitive dissonance that threatens to bubble over into a full-blown existential crisis whenever I think about this for too long.)

The jist of my argument was that if you live in the ethical sphere then you already believe in trying to do the most good with doing the least bad(lamens terms) in your universe, therefore you already submit to being part of something greater than the self.  If living in the ethical sphere means you believe in a power greater than the self then the jump to the religious sphere is unnecessary or not really a jump at all.

What is a panelist?
---

AskPhilosophy is structured on the [AskScience](/r/AskScience) model, which distinguishes people with some degree of expertise in the field in order to draw attention to answers that benefit from a background of study. AskPhilosophy panelists are volunteers who keep an eye on the new queue in order to provide reliable answers to questions asked by the reddit's users and visitors.

What's expected of a panelist?
---

Panelists should make sure they're subscribed to AskPhilosophy, and regularly check the [new queue](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/new/) for new questions. They should attempt to answer questions that fall within their competency, and take an active part in voting on both questions and the replies given in answer. In most cases, if you offer an answer to a question, you should also up vote the question.

Panelists should make an effort to first of all answer questions as representatives of the field, and only add their own speculations or reasoning afterward. They are *not* here to hand down opinions as though from positions of authority, but rather to draw on their educational and professional backgrounds in order to connect answers to the currents and traditions of the discipline. The best answers will name a philosopher or philosophical work suitable to the question, summarize the relevant argument, and explain key concepts in terms appropriate for a general audience.

What are the qualifications?
---

The main qualification is a willingness to check the new queue often, and offer up competent and helpful answers to the questions posted there. AskPhilosophy does not currently perform background checks, though if you're a published philosopher and would like to have your Reddit account associated with your professional persona, a link to a picture or personal page (blog or tweet) with the message ""Hi, AskReddit!"" ought to do it.

Like AskScience, we intend to manage the panel mostly by *post hoc* assessments of each panelist's contributions. If you claim expertise in a particular field, but give consistently imprecise or incorrect answers to questions relating to that field, your status may be either downgraded or revoked at the discretion of the moderators. Additionally, answers should also be polite, discussions should aim at being helpful, and a panelist who consistently or egregiously violates either of those norms may be removed.

How do I recognize a panelist?
---

Panelists are distinguished from other users by the addition of ""flair"" to their names. A panelists flair is also used to indicate their field of expertise and the degree of involvement that characterizes their background.

When you request to be added to the panel, be sure to include the philosophical topics that you consider your primary focus, and let us know how far your background extends -- professional, graduate, undergraduate, or autodidact. For more on those categories, see the [flair description page](http://redd.it/mext6). Requests sent to the moderators without that information may be ignored by the moderators as an indication that the requester did not bother to familiarize themselves with what's expected of panelists.

Therefore, is it even possible to suggest that someone think for themselves without leading to a violation of this very advice?

One might argue that it depends how we define ""think for themselves."" Perhaps we mean ""listen to what other people say, and then rationally judge their position on the merits."" In this case, maybe the person who receives this advice will then proceed to rationally judge the advice on its merits, but in doing so they have already adopted new criteria for belief from an external source.

* We determined that the reason why she feels the way she does is because she believes that one must not restrict the choice of others, at least when it comes to life or death situations.  However even the act of eating anything at all must necessarily mean, in a world of finite resources where people starve every day, that her eating has taken vital resources away from someone whose life utterly depends on it.  Wouldn't this mean that, strictly applying her own reasoning, it is ethically indefensible to eat anything more than the absolute basic necessities required for survival?

* We also determined that an analogous problem would arise from a ""too few lifeboats"" scenario.  Suppose you are on a sinking ship, and there are two lifeboats, however due to some oversight these lifeboats can accomodate everyone except one person on board, and putting even one extra person in a lifeboat will sink it.  Nobody volunteers to sacrifice themselves for the good of others, so it's a free-for-all and it just so happens that you are the last person off the ship.  Now, by my girlfriend's reasoning, it is not unethical for you to choose to jump on to one lifeboat anyway, likely sinking it and killing half the passengers, since you are trying to save yourself.  Remember, it's all about choosing one's own fate.  However it would be unethical to tie up that last person and prevent them from jumping on to the lifeboat.  Something about this does not ring true.

Now, assuming that the consequentialist view is off limits (let's just say for the sake of argument), what objection would you raise to this deontological view of the trolley problem?  Is it ever OK, from a non-consequentialist point of view, to sacrifice someone against their will?  Is the deontological view inherently contradictory?  Or is it merely an ""exclusive-or"" choice between deontology and consequentialism?",,False,,t5_2sc5r,False,,,True,t3_1hus39,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1hus39/got_arguments_against_a_deontological_view_of_the/,

Now, it seems to me that, if our governments were to ban the usage of all harmful substances by their civilians, this would surely be unethical, would it not? Wouldn't we be then having our autonomy taken away from us? Or to ban people from the country who exceeded the body fat percentage limit? This would surely be taking away our freedom to do as we please with our own body, correct? It cannot be said that the state 'owns' our bodies, right? I ask this because, then what is the difference with denying yourself these pleasures in ethics? Why is your state denying you the use of drugs and having the capability to become obese unethical, if doing the same yourself isn't?

But, it also seems to me, on the other hand, that surely it would be unethical to force or coerce someone into practicing an unhealthy lifestyle, right? To bring about an influence upon them which would ultimately cause them harm? Why would it be different with your own body? Where do you draw the line and why? It seems that it might be both unethical to damage ourself in this way, whilst also unethical to allow someone to take away your freedoms to do so.

I'm curious as to what people here in r/askphilosophy think.

I think there well could be.  I'll offer one that just occurred to me to get the ball rolling.  In The Truman Show there is a latent critique of ""utilitarianism"" (in the sense of that philosophy suggesting ""pleasure"" or ""happiness"" as the ultimate constituent of a good life).  Truman seems to have been rather happy in the earlier part of the movie, with all the pleasures a normal person could reasonably ask for.  What if he had never discovered the true nature of his situation?  What if he had lived out his life all the way to death, experiencing happiness but had never actually been responsible for his own happiness?  For him of course this would make no difference, or at least, he would never know the difference.

One was on moral relativism which asserts that universal moral rules do not exist and moral choices have more to do with conflicting evolutionary strategies than conflicting sides with varying moral 'rightness'.

I once had an intelligent designer at my school who criticized moral relativism by attacking moral relativists themselves who, as he claimed, have their own moral agenda and often try to assert their distaste for homophobia, racism, zenophobia, etc. Which brings me to my question: How do moral relativists defend their expression of their own morality? Would a moral relativist use different tactics in winning people over to their point of view?

Another idea cropped up in an interview with two LaVeyan Satanists. In it one of them claimed that whoever has the upper hand is the 'right' one. Basically that the morality of the strong is the one that is more pervasive, and since the morality of the strong varies it isn't so much the moral assertions that are important but who dictates the morality of the people. This almost seems to be a rehash off of moral relativist principles but it averts the attention to other aspects of morality, it doesn't try to remain as objective as moral relativism, and it doesn't try to respect the wishes of the individual but of a particular individual.

So, from what I can gather, his argument is this:

* I'm conscious of my existence as determined in time 
* For this to happen, there must be some permanent reference point that allows me to see my experience in this way. 
* This reference point can't be my own conscious states and it can't be time itself.
* The only thing left for a reference point is the external world
* So the external world must exist because, without it, we can't determine our existence in time. 

That's the argument as I understand it. But I'm having a bit of trouble following it. The first bit about being conscious of my existence as determined in time, does this just mean that he's aware that his experiences have happened in a specific order? Like if time was a long line then event A would happen before event B? If that's what he's saying then I get that.

But then the bit about a reference point. I don't understand why this reference point is needed and I can't find him explaining why in the book. Kind of lost here because if a reference point is needed then I don't see why time itself can't be the reference point. I feel like understanding this sentence would really help:

""Now consciousness [of my existence] in time is necessarily bound up with consciousness of the [condition of the] possibility of the time-determination; and it is therefore necessarily bound up with the existence of things outside me, as the condition of the time-determination."" 

I knew Kant was hard to read but jesus. If someone could help clarify this or link me to some journals or web pages that I should read to understand this then I'll be very grateful.

(Maybe it would be more appropriate to interpret ""defined"" here as ""standing in relation with"")

Either way, this seems to bring about a circularity in which Dasein defines itself by how it brings other things into being by apprehension.

the Dionysian because I admire Nietzsche and want to learn more about him.
However, I'm not confident that my interpretation holds any merit - in fact, the
following text may be cringe-worthy. Hence, I was hoping that /r/askphilosophy
could enlighten me.

After having read of *The Birth of Tragedy*, I equated the Dionysian
disposition to unconscientiousness and the Apollonian disposition to
conscientiousness, where (un)conscientiousness is a trait described by the 
[Five Factor Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#The_five_factors).
I arrived at the equations by considering the fact that, according to the Five
Factor Model, conscientiousness is associated with orderliness and
unconscientiousness is associated with disorderliness.

I took the disorderly Dionysian disposition, and unconscientiousness, to be
useful because it allows one to let go of past beliefs that cause suffering so
that new, healthier, beliefs may take their place. Furthermore, I took the
orderly Apollonian disposition to be useful because it introduces order to one's
life which provides it meaning (""He who has a strong enough why can bear almost
any how"" - Nietzsche). I settled on this interpretation of the Apollonian
and the Dionysian after reading research that suggested that conscientiousness
may, in certain circumstances (e.g. conscientious people experience greater
drops in life satisfaction following unemployment), cause a decrease in well
being, for this research supports Nietzsche's assertion that a balance between
the Apollonian and Dionysian dispositions is desirable.


Also, what's the difference between an Apollonian dispositon and a disposition
influenced primarily by Socratic rationalism? And why was Nietzsche opposed to
Socratic rationalism?

Feel free to correct me or expand etc, but if I make a vulgar statement and suppose that:

*Modernism* can be defined by empiricism, rationalism, the pursuit of Truth and construction of a meta-narrative. And that...

*Postmodernism* can be defined as a reaction to modernism, things became more relative, hermeneutic, contextual and there was a de-construction and abstraction of perceived Truth and the death of a meta-narrative.

It's becoming increasingly obvious that [""Postmodernism is dead.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostPoMo/comments/ysf41/postmodernism_is_dead_prospect_magazine/) - particularly in the arts sector - and that we're beginning to see glimpses of a new era emerging.  It has different names depending on who you talk to. Alan Kirby calls it ""Pseudo-modernism"" and doesn't see much positive coming from it, Epstein likes the prefix ""trans-"".  Vermeulen and Akker attached the prefix ""meta-"" and associate it with oscillations between modern notions and post-modern sensibilities but exists beyond.

It's still pretty wishy-washy and depending on the discipline there are different interpretations.  But I would probably reach and suggest that...

*Post-Postmodernism:* could be defined by a return to a meta-narrative (or atleast the striving for one), perhaps it will be less reactionary and more synthetic.  I think Integral Theory might be a piece of the puzzle (though I am wary of Wilber and his ilk).

Thus it would be possible to will ""lyinge"" to be a universal law, conforming to the CI, while ""lyinga"" could not be willed, so it would be a violation of the CI.

Anyway, my question is more of a ""does this work"" to my own reasoning/puzzling on weather or not we have free will. 

To start off, I was pondering free will and came to ""What is free will?"" which I defined as ""The ability to make a choice differently given the same circumstances.""

Next I went on to ""How do people make choices?"" which I answered ""By going through the predicted outcomes, making those predictions based on their own reasoning."" (in this context I'm allowing for emotions to be part of the reasoning process. Clarifying in case anyone confuses it with strictly logical reasoning.) Essentially saying that people make a mental tally board and go with what ever ""looks best"" when they make the choice.

From this I concluded that there can only be one “best choice” for anyone to act (since having two equally good options seems to be exactly the definition of a dilemma and therefor either no choice until one concludes that there is a difference, or decides that neither is the best choice, and therefor goes and does something else).

Now, if we have only one “best choice” for a given situation, doesn't that mean that we lack free will?

Also another idea popped out of all this as a sort of aside. That functionally, having free will and not having it are/would be exactly the same owing to the fact that you can only make one decision at a time per choice. 

Anyway, I would love to have some input about all of this. Every time I try and talk about it to anyone around, they end up with this vaguely glazed expression and don't actually contribute anything or just brush me off.

(from what I understand) Kierkegaard sees a tension between the ethical (which is universal and which is our ultimate purpose) and faith (which is individual and transcends the ethical). 
If we want to argue that the ethical is the ultimate human purpose then in order to be consistent we would have to denounce faith as evil and call Abraham a lunatic for trying to sacrifice his son. *Fear and Trembling* is Kierkegaard trying to mediate this inconsistency, but what I don't understand is why does this need to be mediated? Why can't we just call Abraham a lunatic, denounce faith as evil? Is there a way to understand ""faith"" outside of its religious connotations so that someone who is nonreligious would be compelled to see it as worth of saving?

I just wanted to work out an example to clarify my thinking on Objectivism and Subjectivism.


Ok, so if someone said ""Slavery is moral wrong as it causes suffering to the slaves"", which is of course quantifiable. But is it still ok to call that Objectivism if it is a subjective value judgement that people shouldn't be slaves in the first place that is the premiss of the statement ""Slavery is wrong"". Or would a Moral Realist dispute that the premiss is a Subjective value judgement in the first place?

What I'm trying to deal with is the idea of saying things are either right or wrong. If we set up criteria of how to judge an action than it is possible to measure how correct or incorrect that action is.

* Is Objectivism trying to say there is one criteria that is always valid? Can that criteria be reached at from a Subjective perspective, while the ideas still remain Objective? 

* Is Subjectivism compatible with the idea of I as an individual deciding the criteria for judging of an action from my own perspective and than me saying things are either right or wrong according to my criteria?

If my example or the question or my understanding is poor please correct me. I understand there is of course lots of different types of Objectivism, Moral Realism and Subjectivism but lets try keep this simple :D

1. Explain why I believe in incompatibility, and why I think that we don't have free will (Chisholm has a good argument).

2. Criticise the arguments of those that I *disagree* with, and/or criticise the objections to the arguments that 
*agree* with.

3. Explain that moral responsibility is a huge problem for believing in determinism.

4. A solution to this problem: ???

I get stuck at this point.

I've been reading ""Why I became an Atheist"" by John Loftus, and encountered a discussion regarding Hume and his view of miracles that has left me perplexed. Let me introduce you to the question by quoting Loftus (via picture, as amazon cloud reader doesn't let me copy and paste): 

http://imgur.com/a/O3s3R

Here's what I make of this:

Hume's critics argue that his claim that ""uniform experience"" is against the occurrence of miracles begs the question, as it is trying to demonstrate that miracles don't occur by claiming that experience shows that miracles don't occur (when in fact this is the point Hume's argument is trying to prove). 

What Fogelin (and John W. Loftus) are saying is that this is a misreading of Hume's argument...Fogelin goes on to state in his book on Hume's Defense of Miracles that most claims of circularity regarding this argument see Hume making the claim that a priori miracles are impossible, when Hume does not say this at all. 

I still don't full understand Loftus' (and Fogelin's) retort to C.S. Lewis, William Lane Craig and other critics of Hume. Could any one elaborate and clarify what's going on here?

edit: So let try to understand this...when Hume is speaking about ""uniform experience,"" he's talking about testimony regarding natural laws (i.e. our knowledge of natural laws)? Which by definition would exclude miracle claims because if they made sense in the context of nature then they wouldn't be miracles anymore?

edit 2: This is another question all together, though somewhat related to this discussion: Does Hume (and other skeptics of miracles) believe we can ever identify a miracle? An example:

Lets say an Evangelical Preacher claims he can cure the sick. And appears to do so, once at least. A congregant of his is cured of some manner of cancer after he prays for her.

In this instance the chance of a cancer going into spontaneous remission appears to be greater than the chance that this preacher has somehow suspended natural law, so a skeptic has a very sound basis with which to dismiss the preacher's claim to miraculous power.

But what if this preacher consistently and repeatedly heals the sick? And does so under the scrutiny of attentive scientists and doctors? What if he cures 10, or a 100, or a 1000 cancer patients (or people with various ailments) and does so in a manner that escapes natural explanation?* 

Would the possibility of his actually performing a miracle be greater than the chance that this is all just coincidence? How would we begin calculating that?

http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/n5wx4/a_few_random_questions/

If man understood himself through symbols (words, semiotics) and ethereal non-symbols (according to Wittgenstein), could the unilateral thinking of ""science solves all"" succumb to an eventual collapse because the subject at hand, according to that type of thinking, can only be truly understood by ""knowing"" the material, when those unfamiliar can only ""understand"" something with symbols and their counterpart? When I say unilateral, I mean the type of thinking that doesn't allow for explanations through interpretation, only facts. I realize most people (like scientists) don't act or think this condescendingly about others.


Did Wittgenstein apply his Philosophical Investigations reasoning to mathematics? In accordance with his idea that the idea of God (and other words) are misunderstood because something transcendent (or a non-thing) cannot be defined, do problems in mathematics arise out of the numbers themselves (equations or the numbers)? If so, would this affect how people define numbers?


Logically speaking, does using the eternal return concept (the idea that you will live this life over and over forever) as the ultimate motivational boost affect have any negative effects? I don't mean in terms of physical actions specifically, (although, I would include it), but other hard-to-define type things, like emotional openness (because you would feel that emotion forever), honesty with oneself (what's the point in not being honest with yourself over and over?), and possibly even the way you spend or think about money (would the value of particular item lose value for all eternity, or does the item hold special ""undefinable"" qualities?).

If you'd like to be a panelist (which is the only way to get flair in AskPhilosophy) [see this thread](http://redd.it/mdane).

---

After a discussion in the [earlier version](http://redd.it/md6s2) of this thread, as well as some cordial back-and-forth in panel requests, I've decided that a revision of how we label panelists would make flair more useful. I hope this change comes early enough in AskPhilosophy's development that it doesn't cause much confusion.

Previously, the color of a panelist's flair indicated the general branch of philosophy that best characterized that panelist's background (e.g. epistemology). Effective immediately, flair will no longer specify ""field"" as a default parameter. Panelists are still free to specify one of those branches as a part of their focus if they think it's an accurate description of their expertise.

You'll notice, however, that flair is still color-coded. Those colors now represent the level of involvement that characterizes that panelist's background. There are, for right now, four categories that apply\*:

* Professional: the panelist derives part of their income through philosophical work, either as an instructor of some sort, a working professional (e.g. applied ethicist), or through the publication of philosophical papers in reputable journals;

* Graduate: the panelist is enrolled in, or has completed, a graduate program in philosophy or a *closely* related field;

* Undergrad: the panelist is enrolled in, or has completed, an undergraduate program in philosophy;

* Autodidact: the panelist has little or no formal education in philosophy, but is an enthusiastic self-educator and intense reader in the field.

The text of a panelist's flair is the focus of their study, as they described it to us when they requested to be made a panelist.

I hope this revision makes flair both more useful and less obscure, and also simplifies the process of assigning flair to panelists whose backgrounds are diverse and difficult to pigeonhole.

Thanks for bearing with us.

I also stumbled upon a relevant quote from Buckminster Fuller, ""You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.""

Then there is the subjective concept of ""good"" vs ""evil""-- and the very act of ""naming evil"" seems to me equivalent to identifying oneself as against a thing as well.

One idea (supposedly defended by several philosophers) seemed to be that laws of nature exist and cause things to happen, ie, they are pushy explainers:

&gt;They make things happen in certain ways and by this power, their existence allows us to explain why things happen in certain ways.

However, not all philosophers view laws this way.  Some see laws simply as a ""system of regularities that best encaspulate all the events in universal history."". The events of universal history determine the laws.  

My reading of this is that these philosophers would say that laws of nature don't really exist, rather events exist and we create laws to describe these events.  But these laws are human creations that don't exist outside our mind.

&gt; Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of action or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what ""ought"" to be. ""Equal rights for all"", ""Excellence deserves admiration"", and ""People should be treated with 
respect and dignity"" are representative of values.

Here is morality:

&gt; Morality [...] is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are ""good"" (or right) and those that are ""bad"" (or wrong).

So in other words, a ""value"" is a person's given valuation of some actions or outcomes; while morality concerns the judgment as to whether something is moral or not.

So Kant would have you treat your neighbor as a normal human no matter what.

I'm much less sure about what Plato would say. If he values the soul rather than the body, and if we can identify consciousness with the soul and therefore conclude that P-zombies have no souls, I suspect he'd say ""go ahead and shoot your neighbor.""

I've noticed a couple of analogies that keep popping up. The first compares the morality of same-sex marriage to that of interracial marriage. The idea is to point to a view that was widely held in the past (that interracial marriage was morally wrong) that's easy to see is mistaken, as a way to show how opposition to marriage equality is similarly mistaken. The other analogy is around the question of whether homosexual behavior or orientation is ""chosen"" or inborn, and what follows from that. Again, the analogy has to do with race, and goes like this: just as it's wrong to discriminate against  people based on their race (which they did not choose) it's wrong to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation (or, presumably, the behavior which follows from that orientation), which is also not chosen. 

So, let's say Alice asserts what we might call the liberal view: ""Surely you agree that we should not forbid marriage based on the race of the participants, right? Can't you see that for the same reason we shouldn't forbid it based on their gender?""

Bob the conservative responds: ""Your analogy is flawed, because sexual behavior is chosen, while race is not.""

Now, Bob's argument seems like crap to me, but I can't put my finger on why. Granting for the sake of argument that all sexual behavior is ""chosen"" (which is problematic, but let's go with it), it seems to me that it's not relevant. In other words, because of the nature of analogies, there will always be differences in the target and the source. The trouble is determining which of those differences are relevant (which harm the analogy and which don't).

What I would really like is an example of an analogy that everyone would buy, and then an example of a bad objection to that analogy, based on an irrelevant difference between the source and target. I guess I want a sort of meta-analogy.

As I look this over before posting, I wonder if part of the problem might be that Alice's assertion is vague, in that she does not spell out what she's asserting, but only its relation to another (clearer) assertion. Also, there's some fancy footwork in possible conflation between sexual orientation and behavior, but I'm not sure that's important.

Hello everyone,

Longtime lurker, first time poster. I've been ""familiar"" with and interested in many philosophical ideas and thinkers since my best friend introduced me to philosophy a couple years ago, but it wasn't until a literature class I took last quarter called Historicism that I formally took the plunge in trying to understand philosophy. We read parts of Hegel's *Phenomenology*, Vico's *New Science*, Marx's *Early Political Writings* and *Capital, Vol. I*, bits of Jameson and Benjamin, etc.

I loved trying to read *Phenomenology* so much that I asked the professor if I could take his graduate seminar he'd be teaching the following quarter on critical theory, where we'd spend our class time trudging through and discussing *The Phenomenology*'s preface, paragraph-by-paragraph, in Frankfurt fashion, along with other supplemental readings. I'm in the class now, and my final project for the course is using Stoker's *Dracula* as fictional mediation to help explain the philosophical concepts we're learning, i.e. Hegel's dialectics, his view of history as a whole, as Absolute truth; Lukács's reification; Marx's take on the vampiristic nature of capital and alienation; and etc. (If anyone's interested, I'd be willing to share my graded final paper.)

ANYWAY, I feel like I started trying to understand philosophy with some really heavy readings, and that I need to regress back to the basics before diving deeper.

I'm staying in Ecuador this whole summer with said best friend, and we're bringing a bunch of books.

I'd like some suggestions on a single text that deals with the history of Western consciousness as a whole, in Hegelian fashion. Right now I'm of course leaning towards Bertrand Russell's *A History of Western Philosophy*, but are there any other texts that I should consider that you feel is ""better,"" for lack of a better word? I've been suggested Horkheimer's *Eclipse of Reason*. Any others?

Is there a reason for that? Am I trying to see order in something where there is non? Or are authors of the books I have read making these connections for educational reasons? I would love if someone could give me a pointer, so that i can understand these meta-philosophical (if that is even a word) connections or put my mind at ease by explaining that I am reading too much into them. 

And since my knowledge of philosophy ends in the mid 1900s: Is that distinction still something philosophers are talking about or is there some form of consent by now?

With physics, you have to discover the laws that are applicable in your universe and then work from there. In mathematics, we can start with any set of axioms we like. The only thing it seems to depend on is the ability to define those axioms, and a concept of true and false.

Eventually the government starts passing laws that make the country transition into a dictatorship (or any un-democratic system you can think of) over a period of a few years or decades.

At a philosophical level, is there any way to prevent such a thing within the bounds of democratic and liberal values and/or practices?

If the answer is ""no"" (meaning the answer to the question in the title is ""yes""), does that mean:

- democracy and liberalism is an inherently weak, shoot-oneself-in-the-foot kind of system?

My tits are always calm and cheerful, thank you.

**My background:**
Even the women I know who were in undergraduate philosophy majors all changed to minors and went to a more female balanced field. And the female graduate students I was friends with were all from other countries where there IS a balance of sexes in the field. The was ONE woman professor my first term, she was brilliant, and the next term she left for cornell, and there were ZERO woman faculty for the rest of the time I was in the department.

I've personally been told I'm too forward; I've read all the readings assigned and reached different conclusions that I present to the class, many whom obviously have not read the texts as they misquote terribly; I find that the professor seems to be inserting his views into something that clearly doesn't imply what he says it is, and then even after getting good paper grades, gotten D's and been told that I only got the passing grade because these professors felt bad that I had a learning disability (I do NOT); with other professors I ace the classes, and the professors find my interpretations insightful and have invited me to their office outside office hours to talk about my findings.

So, how can this be fixed? I'm two classes away from graduation, yet I haven't been to school in two years because I'm afraid of the gamble of who I will get for the _required_ courses. I'm considering transferring to a different university that has women faculty (this uni does not) and losing half the credits I have, just to be in a more encouraging environment.

I met with my professor today, and we discussed my selections. I decided to propose *The Gay Science*, *Twilight of the Idols*, and *Ecce Homo*. She agreed that *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* is a bit too ambitious to tack onto the end of this project. She is excited to read these works again, and I know we'll have a wonderful semester with Nietzsche.

Thanks a lot for the advice, everyone.

___________________________________________________

I need to propose three works to read with my professor for an individual investigation. She is a Nietzsche scholar who would be able to help me through basically anything from 19th Century philosophy or Existentialism. Since I am interested in Nietzsche myself, I am pretty sure I would like to propose three of Nietzsche's works. I have already read the following by Nietzsche:

*The Birth of Tragedy*

*On the Advantages and Disadvantages of History for Life*

*Beyond Good and Evil*

*On the Genealogy of Morals* (three times)

I have in mind to propose the following:

*The Gay Science*

*Thus Spoke Zarathustra*

*Twilight of the Idols*

I chose *The Gay Science* primarily because she covers it often. *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* serves as a good transition between his middle and late periods, and *Twilight of the Idols* summarizes themes from his later thought. Thus, I chose these three to investigate that sort of connection since I'm only remotely familiar with his early and late work.

Do these three seem adequate, or are there others that are more important/interesting? And is there anyone I should be reading before Nietzsche that she might be able to help with?

I've got a question regarding ethics and gay/straight marriage. I sincerely don't wish to offend anyone here, so I apologise in advance if anything I say hits a nerve in anyone. Also, I apologise for the really long set-up to my questions.

I was having a discussion last night with a friend on gay marriage. He said that he was not going to get married until homosexuals were legally able to in every state (we both live in the USA), on the grounds that he doesn't ""support unequal rights of any sort."" I agreed that equal rights are important and that I felt it was wrong to deny anyone their given rights, and that legalizing gay marriage was an important issue to me. However, I did disagree on the importance of what he was doing. I said that I personally felt 'not doing something' in protest of any issue, when not also accompanied by any other actions where you are actively doing something (such as writing letters to the people with the power to change things, donating to the cause, etc etc,) didn't seem to further the cause. I don't think it's wrong to do, or bad, and more power to anyone who wants to make a personal statement, I just thought that it didn't seem to do much of anything. Again, this is all just in my opinion and I acknowledge that I could be wrong.

Anyway, this is where the part my questions really relate to comes in. After I said what I said, he responded with ""I'm not doing it to further the cause or whatever. I'm doing it because it's the ethical thing to do."" I said I didn't feel that my taking advantage of my ability to get married (as I'm in a heterosexual relationship and do wish to marry my boyfriend someday) was a reflection on anyone else's rights, as well as whether or not I support their rights, or whether or not I support the abuse of their rights.

He supported his argument by saying ""You take advantage of your rights, pay for a marriage license, pay for a wedding, lease a chapel, and the only person that wants gays to marry is the caterer. Maybe. Why would I ever support those people with my money?""

While I do agree he has a point with the 'showing my support (or lack thereof) with my money' thing, during our long discussion his overall argument seemed to be 'It is unethical for a heterosexual couple in the USA to get married because homosexual couples in the same country cannot, and to do so would be supporting the taking away of those rights.'

So, my questions to you, fellow Redditors of Askphilosophy, are as follows:

1.) Is it ethical, morally or otherwise, for a heterosexual couple to get married, if marriage is considered a right, and not everyone is actually afforded that right?
2.) Is it ethical to take advantage of any right you are given if not everyone has that same right?
3.) Is it ethical to take advantage of any PRIVILEGES you are given if not everyone has that same privilege?

I recognize that not everyone views ethics the same way, and that there can be a wide variety of equally valid answers to the same question when it comes to ethics. I'm just honestly really interested to hear your responses to these questions. Or even responses to any of the opinions I put forth in my whole post. The conversation between my friend and I got heated last night, he took everything I said personally and started to tell me to just stop talking and called me names. So I didn't really get the opportunity to hear more in-depth explanations to his opinions or actions, or the opportunity to really ask any questions because he pretty much stopped responding with anything more than ""Stop talking to me about this"" fairly straightaway. I'm not doing this to try and prove either of us are right and I don't intend on ever bringing this up with him again, as it was clearly just not a topic he was willing to discuss with me, given my personal viewpoints I had put forth. I was just thinking about it this morning and wondered about his arguments about how ethical all these things were.

Isn't the constitution in argument in favor of Machiavelli, a document that is has helped our nation find and maintain the government's power?

1351369168.0,13,self.askphilosophy,126qsu,Why Freewill Cannot Exist in a Material Universe,veryhungryboy,20,7,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/126qsu/why_freewill_cannot_exist_in_a_material_universe/,"Can you help provide me with some criticisms of this essay? I'm trying to use quantum indeterminacy to argue against it but it leads to randomness, rather than freewill. Help please.

Freewill, it seems to me, is assumed by most people. It is assumed to be so because we can feel it. We feel the causes of our decisions and we feel the effects of our decisions. We feel the conscious process of decision-making as surely as we can feel a book in our hands. It is because of this inherent feeling that freewill has been spared the rigorous investigation that concepts such as God have been subject to. Religion is seen as a matter of faith, whereas freewill is almost universally-accepted as fact. However, I aim to show that freewill is a concept no less metaphysical than any religious deity. 

Let us first reject any metaphysical interpretations of the universe, and accept only what empirical evidence allows us to infer. From this, we understand the universe to be wholly material; made up purely of protons, neutrons and electrons. We then infer that the whole of this material universe is subject to certain immutable laws that govern the interactions of matter, such as Einstein’s Theories of General and Special Relativity and, above all, the Laws of Cause and Effect. These laws are unchanging, eternal and all-encompassing and so they provide a strong model from which to view the universe. These eternal and unbreakable laws suggest a deterministic view of the material universe, whereby every cause produces a specific and determined effect and a different outcome is impossible. The nature of the cause determines the nature of the effect absolutely, and so if exactly the same cause were to occur again, it would produce exactly the same effect. When this premise is extended to encompass the entirety of the universe, it logically follows that the universe is akin to a chain of dominoes, with the dominoes set up in such a way that they must fall a certain way. As a result, I propose that the future could, theoretically, be inferred if enough was known about present conditions. Pierre-Simon Laplace argued that “we may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future” and thus suggested the hypothetical possibility of a ‘demon’, who, knowing the exact position and momentum of every atom in the universe, could logically infer the past and the future using the laws of the universe. We view the happenings of the universe as unpredictable and undetermined because we do not yet understand enough of the universe and its laws. However, if we fully understood, we could see the whole chain of dominoes and from this, the past and future. 

We must next accept that humans are inextricably part of this material world and so we too are governed by the laws of the universe. We are made up of the very same stuff as the stars and the ground and so we are subject to the very same laws. Humans seems to have no problem accepting that their bodies are governed by universal laws, as we feel these physical constraints every day, but it is when we attempt to extend these laws to the mind that reluctance occurs. People observe cause and effect happening in the universe but choose to believe they are somehow exempt from this law. If the universe is purely material, it follows that our minds are purely material. Our minds are located in space and they are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. Just as the wider universe has laws to govern its interactions, so must the mind, and I believe it is because we do not yet understand these laws of the mind that we propagate the notion of freewill. The mind is a complex system, governed by complex laws that determine our actions, and the ‘freewill’ we feel is these complex laws being applied to our present situation. There are countless instances of humans inventing concepts to cover our lack of understanding, using the metaphysical to explain what science cannot, and I believe freewill to be one of these concepts. One such example of this is the weather. The weather used to be quite unpredictable and unexplainable and, consequently, some ancient societies attributed it to the will of the gods. Nowadays, we know that the weather has certain causes that produce certain effects, and we can use these causes to predict (relatively) accurately what the weather will be. At the present moment, human behaviour can be quite unpredictable and unexplainable; we do not fully understand the laws of the mind and so we label this unpredictability freewill. 

Now let us more critically analyse the process of decision-making. When choosing between two alternatives, what do you have to aid to your decision? You can only draw on two things; the present situation and your past experiences. We know, from the paragraphs above, that the present situation is entirely outside your control. It is one domino in the infinite chain of dominoes. It has been brought about exclusively by the laws of the universe, and could never be any other way. It is clear that there is no freedom to be gained from the present situation. Your past experiences are similarly uncontrollable. You do not decide where or when you are born and from that moment, all your past experiences were previously present situations: present situations over which you have no control. So any possible source of freedom lies in the way you interpret the present situation; how your mind interacts with it. However, we’ve already asserted that the mind interacts with decisions through certain laws: immutable, eternal and all-encompassing laws. There is no room for freedom in this picture. Your mind never could have decided differently. The process of decision-making is simply your mind applying its laws to your present situation.
These premises logically lead on to a psychologically deterministic view of the mind. By applying the laws of cause and effect onto the mind we necessarily infer that all psychological states and events are caused by previously existing psychological states and events. Psychological determinists assert that all decisions are caused by previously existing psychological factors, and that we are already on our way to understanding some of these factors. You already have a good idea how your friends or family will react to certain things and you regularly use this knowledge to predict their future behaviour. This, I argue, is evidence that the laws of the mind are uniform and that we already have a general idea of what they are. 

From this we must conclude that the concept of freewill is incoherent within a purely material universe. A universe consisting exclusively of atoms and governed by cause and effect is a determined universe. We as humans would be trapped in a chain of cause of effect which determines all our decisions for us. For freewill to exist, our minds must have some metaphysical element, some intuition above and beyond the universe that we can draw on to make truly free decisions. Humanity would be akin to gods; possessing some supernatural ability to transcend cause and effect, because to be truly free is to act without a cause, to create something from nothing.

I have some questions but the class discussions are really more about historiographic conceptions and my questions are a bit fundamental.  Solution: ask reddit… if I’m in the wrong place, please feel free to show me the door.

One of the big debates among historians in the twentieth century, apparently led by the postmodernists, relativists and skeptics is about the existence of objective truth… Frankly, I have always assumed that the existence of an objective truth is axiomatic, but it seems that I have been shaped by the culture of Western Enlightenment. 

The way I figure it the statement “There is no objective truth” has some problems, and I was hoping someone could tell me if I’m missing something (I probably am…)

* “There is no objective truth” is a negative claim and if there is even one thing that can be shown to be objectively true then the initial statement is false.

* “There is no objective truth” is by definition self negating. In order for it to be true, it must be false.

To be clear, I don’t think that anyone has necessarily discovered objective truth. I’m not even sure if objective truth is even discoverable. 

However, it was my impression that a thing is a thing regardless of whether or not we’ve described the thing correctly… (sloups are sloupy even if we say they are say that they are frozy), the observer or the reporter or investigator or whatever doesn’t imbue a fact with truth, the veracity is outside the observation. The accuracy of the observational method, the social or cultural biases of the observer, and the context in which the observation was made can lead an observer to describe a sloup as frozy, but that doesn’t *make* the sloup frozy, the observation was just wrong.

**Popper:** 

Science and knowledge never meet and science never reaches the truth

Good science is


* Propose a theory

* Attempt to falsify

* If falsified, propose another theory (repeat)


**Kuhn:** 

Disagrees with Popper

* Science is progressive (refers to history of science and shifts in thinking)

* Refers to paradigm (Science is governed by a set of principals)

* Anomalies cause change, create a crisis

* Scientific revolution is like a political revolution

**Hume:**

I'm not sure if he agrees with this or is against it

* Two argument types: Deductive (One conclusion) or Inductive (Most likely conclusion)

* We rely on cause and effect

* No logical connection between cause and effect, we rely on experience

The user I was responding to was asserting that Wittgenstein was not a materialist during the era of the Tractatus because of his commitment to the 'colorless' logical simples / objects that combine to form atomic facts / states of affairs (depending on the translation, I believe.)  I will just copy and paste my question here:

&gt;I'm by no means an expert, but I am wondering whether his talk of simples necessarily commits him to a non-materialist metaphysical view. Also I am currently reading PI and have been looking a lot of secondary material on his later work so that may be tainting my thinking, just a word of warning.
&gt;
&gt;I feel like the command to throw away the ladder must be taken very seriously. It seems to me that he wanted to say that 'atomic facts' or 'states of affairs' are the rock bottom of analysis, and therefore that the fundamental building blocks of 'The World' come with truth values. This is a huge break from the philosophical tradition which speaks of propositions consisting of substance and attribute, and Wittgenstein is well aware of this. He posits these hypothetical, invisible, colorless, basically nonsensical objects in order to ease you in to things. They serve merely a functional role in allowing you to accept that states of affairs are going to be where all of the important action is happening.
&gt;
&gt;I read it as though he is preemptively countering the inevitable question 'what ARE states of affairs though?' by saying 'well they are the configuration of these simple objects that we can't talk about and have no properties in any sense that you could ever comprehend, aside from the fact that they form states of affairs which you CAN comprehend. so just forget about them and focus on the states of affairs.'
I mean if these metaphysical simples aren't the ladder we are to discard, then what is?

So can anyone help me get to the bottom of this?  People toss around words like 'mysticism' when discussing Wittgenstein, but despite this I never got the feeling that he would truly try to assert these metaphysical entities.  The whole idea of proposing mysterious metaphysical stuff seems to conflict with the vibe I get from reading his work.

The question is  something like  

""While X  was disguised himself as a woman, what song did the women sing?""

But I seem to be having a major problem in this department. I am not even sure that I am in the right place or that im asking the right question. Maybe one of you esteemed thinkers could help me find the right question.

So to figure out why I'm asking the question here is a little about me. 
From the outside I imagine my life looks quite normal. I am 28 years old. I have a wife and a  year old son. I have held a low paying job (14 dollars CAD hour) for 6 years now. I deal with technology and computer taking hardware our company produces and putting it together with our software.

One of the greatest things going for me in my life is my family. I know beyond a doubt that my parents , brothers, wife and son love me. I think that I learned from my parents  how important it is for a family to stick together.
I am well liked and in my whole life there are only 2 people that I can remember that do not like me. I can make most people laugh in almost any situation or conversation as long as they don't have a block setup against laughing (horrible moods or example)


If you were to take a closer look at my life I think society would find me a failure. Born to parents who worked their way from almost poverty to a comfortable spot in the middle class. Some would even say they are upper middle class.  
Now me and my wife are living paycheck to paycheck. I do not have anything of great value to show for myself. My wife works part time on weekends but that doesn't help much. My credit rating is bad from an old debt i took too long to pay off. I have 0 debt at this time.
My health is in the gutter as I recently had a bad episode with my back and the pain while it has decreased has gone chronic. I smoke both cigarettes and pot and am overweight. 

At the slightest criticisms my wife goes overboard emotionally. If I mention something like that she could clean the house when she is home all week alone with our son  or that dinner would be nice after work, she gets super upset.  

I feel that you would think of me as very lazy.

I feel that if it wasn't for my parents and their monetary assistance for us we could have ended up on the street years ago. I feel that I am failing at life and I have had this feeling sometimes stronger sometimes weaker since I was 14 -15 or so and realized how big and tough the world is.


When it comes down to it I am sure that it is Me that is holding me back and I am afraid of what might happen should I loose my parents and the support they represent.


Thusly I need to better my life but I just can't seems to think of the proper steps of the proper way to get into a better situation.
This I am sure comes down to my way of thinking.

I will now try to describe or give examples on how I think.

All my life people have been telling me that I say weird things. While this can often be interpreted as funny it gives me huge issues in holding a conversation.  

The only time I can eagerly talk about a topic is when its about video gaming. Even then the vast majority of it is me and my partner spewing random facts at each other. Like how good on game is. What another game is all about. And I will receive the same style of fact answers back. Is this conversation? The spewing of facts and maybe the odd question about the topic?

What is a conversation even beyond the statement of facts? 
Why is it so incredibly easy for my parents to strike up a dinner conversation yet awkward silence is no stranger to me?

I like to think I'm smart. I love going on the web and reading about  ancient History and pre history. I love reading and watching shows about science especially physics. I can regurgitate facts from this stuff easy enough  but that doesn't mean that i can draw my own conclusions.

As far as what's going on in my head its mostly blank. I do so much on instinct even at work with no. For example this text I wrote here is a great example. It poured from my fingers and my voice in my head only narrated it as I wrote it down and spoke as I reread the lines of text. There was the odd popup thought of something to add or to change.   

How do you as a philosopher think?  Do you have constant narration inside of you that argues out points. Is it ever still inside of you like it is in my head?


**EDIT:**

A great thank you to everyone that has responded.  There is a lot of information that you all have given me since I originally asked my question. So much in fact that I have not been able to digest it all properly yet.  However I want you all to know that I have read every single post and I am taking your answers very seriously.

What I need to do now is create a road map for myself. A plan to follow up on the seeds of knowledge you gave me.

Thank you once more Everyone.

Specifically of Heidegger’s use of the tree in bloom (part I – Lecture 4). Just for info on terms if you are going to throw them around, I’ve also read Being in Time, and Questions Concerning Technology.

My understanding, ideas are images or representations of objects in the world to map them. Thinking is an attempt to make mental maps so that we may better connect ideas together. Technological and scientific thinking has become entangled within our own mapping. Heidegger argues that language is not merely a labeling system, but scientific thinking has reduced it to this. This is the reduction of what is to our idea, in our mind making them one in the same. We thus use language as a matter of reduction to transform ideas into signs (i.e. an Exit sign, it can only be interpreted in one sense) and lose all sense of symbols (symbols are open to interpretation and disclose something fundamental to an objects being). 

Scientific thinking has decontextualize the world of meaning for us in the very way are able to think. Even in such a ‘simple’ case as a tree in bloom? Is this what Heidegger is attempting to say?

For those who don’t have the work in front of them here is a small part of it, Heidegger writes, “[standing face to face with a tree in bloom] For we shall forfeit everything before we know it, once the sciences of physics, physiology, and psychology, not to forget scientific philosophy, displace the panoply of their documents and proofs, to explain to us that we see and accept is properly not a tree but in reality a void, thinly sprinkled with electric charges here and there that rather hither and yon at enormous speeds. It will not do to admit, just for the scientifically unguarded moments, so to speak, that, naturally, we are standing face to face with a tree in bloom, only to affirm the very next moment as equally obvious that this view, naturally, typifies only the naïve, because pre-scientific, comprehension of things.”

[This wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_%28logic%29) offers an example problem with people on an island figuring out the eye color of other people on the island.

If I understand it, each person instantly logically deduces any truth possible and this fact is public knowledge. People do not talk about other people's eye color, nor do they look in mirrors, however, if one finds out their eye color they must leave the island the following day. This is also public knowledge. So, a stranger comes to the island and states that he sees someone with blue eyes. This fact now becomes public knowledge. The truth is that there are 100 people with blue eyes, and, according to the answer of the problem, on the 100th day after the stranger revels his observation all the people with blue eyes will leave the island.

Wiki offers an induction proof saying if there were only one person with blue eyes then the person with blue eyes can figure out it is himself who must leave. If there are two blue eyed people, no one will leave the first day. (Which will surprise both blue eyed people who likely suspected the other blue eyed person was going to leave on day one.) Thus, the second day both blue eyed people will realize that there must be two blue eyed people and that they themselves are the second and they will both leave. The induction up to 100 blue eyed people follows.

However... This second step of the induction makes certain extra claims of public knowledge. Namely it assumes that everyone knows that everyone can see color (for example) It also assumes that everyone takes time to even look at other people's eyes and so on. IE it assumes it is public knowledge that everyone already knows what everyone's eye color is. But that makes what the stranger said redundant. IE, it was **already** public knowledge that there was someone on the island with blue eyes.... so doesn't that defeat the whole point of the thing?",,False,,t5_2sc5r,False,,,True,t3_ntiys,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/ntiys/common_knowledge_logic_concept_why_is_this/,

I've been told this is similar to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but that person's explanation didn't make sense:

Hypothetical ant hill. Ants pick up crumbs, move somewhere else, then drop them. Guy finds ant hill. Studies ant hill for a very long time. Experiments with dropping crumbs himself. Establishes a ""code""; with certain ""inputs"" of crumbs at certain places at certain times, man creates reliable output. Basically, ant hill = computer. Guy works at it more. Eventually is able to hold ""conversation"" with ant hill: highly complex input = highly complex output interpreted as words. Individual ants don't realize what's happening, but as a whole they create a conscious ""mind"" that can pass the Chinese Room. Hofstadter makes the argument that this is how our brains work.

My question is, couldn't the entire planet be a giant ""anthill""? By definition, there must be some way to interpret the actions of our world as a whole into a code that produces words. However, that wouldn't do much. What if, however, some people were born with the ability to notice patterns in the world, just as some people are born able to decipher numerical patterns, or other such things. These people with ""insight"" could ""hear"" the message, and thusly have the feeling that they are certain of something greater than themselves, aka God. Most people with ""insight"" aka religious people, would have very low ability; only to be able to sense the existence of something ""greater"" than them. The prophets of old and spiritual leaders of modern days may have been extremely sensitive to the ""world pattern"" and actually derived entire words, sentences paragraphs from it. Just as a Roman peasant would have trouble describing a cell-phone, so too would Jesus describing something as complex as the world as a whole. This provides for the seemingly archaic messages of the religious texts.

I hope this all makes sense to whoever reads it, and I'm sorry about its length.

All these measures are properties of the individual they measure.  Age is the number of years one has lived. Race is (more or less) the colour of one's complexion.  Intelligence (though nebulous) is one's ability to reason, detect patterns, and propose creative solutions. 

Sex, one could reasonably claim, is the measure of a number of biological features: chromosome type, anatomical features (penis and/or vagina and/or breasts), and hormonal characteristics.  While this entails some variance from the male-female dichotomy, it still is relatively concrete as there is always a configuration that is ""hormonally male"" or ""anatomically female"".  It's easy to set defining characteristics for either end of the gradient.

Gender is far less definite, to the point that it almost seems purposelessly vague to even discuss it.  What does gender measure?

I do think that ""feeling"" in some way that something is right even if you can't explain why - caring about others, for example - can be a major incentive for moral behavior. If something ""seems"" right in that kind of gut feeling or intuitive way, then you're more likely to agree that it's the right course of action. 

In the absence of that feeling, a rational justification for moral behavior seems sufficient, though possibly weaker since most people don't make purely rational choices. Though it seems like most of the ethical standards or schools that I've heard of rely on a ""feels right"" base at some point or another.

However, since it's unlikely that everyone will have the same feelings regarding right and wrong, at one time or another most of us will wind up doing some things just because someone taught us it was right, unless we can come up with a rational justification for it. Is ""having been taught"" a good justification for behaving a certain way, or should one always be seeking to behave in accordance with either basic feelings or rational thinking?

What are some sources I could look at that might address all of this?

This question was specifically prompted by this [Philosophy Bites interview](http://philosophybites.com/2009/08/sabine-d%C3%B6ring-on-emotion.html) with Sabine Doring, but it also arises as I think through which ""rules"" I've been taught regarding morality feel right or make sense to me at this point in my life, which don't, and how I ought to think about such things.

Since philosophy is still a new subject to me and my professor is relentless, I was hoping to get your input on some of the theories and ideas!

So, I understand that the Bourgeois public sphere came out of the private sphere during the 1800s, but how exactly did it function within it? How was its relationship to the intimate and private spheres manifested in Habermasian discourse?

In regards to Habermas' theory of the actual structural transformation of the public sphere, what is its relationship with the emergence of capitalism and mass society? Is this theoretical foundation based closely to what Adorno and Horkheimer had with their concepts of Mass society?
What were some of the tendencies that Habermas saw with the concept of ""refeudalization"" of relations between the private and public spheres? I can't really see a relationship between the feudal ""private sphere"" and the modern private sphere.

Also, both Foucault and Habermas both had differing opinions towards Enlightenment, yet, it seems like they are fundamentally similar (or maybe I'm wrong). Foucault said that Enlightenment was just the utilization of unjustifiable means to an end? Did they have similar views in regards to politics and power as well?
I understand that since Foucault was a Nietzschean philosopher that he rejected positivism, but what exactly was his approach to the genealogical critique here? And what did he mean by ""stakes, homogeneity, systematicity, and generality""?

When it comes to Discipline, Foucault seemed to dictate that all was done for the state, yet his interpretation of Panopiticism eludes me. What is the relation between these two? Also, what are his relations with ethics and politics or am I looking at two completely different concepts?

Finally, Foucault’s analysis of “dividing practices” related to his treatment of them to his concept of “biopower” and disciplinary practice. Why is biopower such an important concept in regards to dividing practices?

Typically all of our behavior in one way or another is in the pursuit of happiness.

Since knowing good moral behavior brings yourself happiness, knowing moral behavior is knowing yourself (your human life). 

However, we commonly do things that are outside of our morals and in turn cause us to experience pain and unhappiness. Obviously no one wants to experience these feelings so the only reason we do things outside of good moral behavior is because of ignorance.

My question is as to whether or not this objection constitutes a type error.

The function itself, therefore, is of order n+1. As the function is only defined for arguments of order n or less, it cannot take as argument itself (as it is order n+1).

I did A-Level philosophy, but 2 years early, so almost 4 years ago now, and the style of essay seems to have completely changed in the jump from A-Level to university level.

Is this a correct evaluation?

I'm currently hovering around the 60-70% mark in essays, which is adequate and corresponds to a 2:1, but the feedback I get isn't always to great, and seems fairly nonchalant, so I'm finding it hard to know where to improve.  

This week's essay question is this (no need for content help, but structure help would be much appreciated): 

''Why does Kant insist that moral action must be based upon the motive of duty and not the motive of inclination? Is he right about this?''

Where the typical asker of existential questions is highly worried by these ideas, lying awake at night, etc., I openly accepted the apparent pointlessness of life, resigning myself to being ultimately worthless. 

Since everything amounted to nothing, there was no point striving and I essentially lost 4 years of my life to a self-imposed hermitage of sorts. I even found philosophy pointless, which prevented me from demanding an alternative. These 4 years were between the ages of 16-20 - presumably some of the good ones - in which I tried countless hobbies but got bored of them all. I almost failed high school and went straight onto academic probation at university, since I fail to study. This state of being has not been pleasant. 

So far, I have thought: If existentialism is a school of thought in philosophy, there must be others in which our existence is presumed to be purposeful. If that is the case, subscribing to such a school will certainly help with my inability to see things through. This has given me what is best described as a burst of hope, motivating me to find these answers. I am not sure how long this will last, but for now I am no longer content believing that I am pointless. I find myself filled with a demand for purpose. I must know why I am here. 

So I ask of you, /r/askphilosophy, what is the answer to existentialism? Where do I find purpose? And if there is none, why am I able to contemplate my own pointlessness? What purpose does that achieve?

To do so, we would have to determine the basic forms of information and what drove their creation.  

I was completely perplexed.  To me, information is not something which can be created.  It simply is.  The things we mean when we say information: genetics, language, culture, etc, seem to be, at the root of it, simply various recombinations of something more fundamental.

Second, I wasn't sold on the fact that information could exist outside of the human mind.  It's hard for me to explain, but I can't fully disconnect something's existence from observation.  For example, we say that the Great Wall of China exists, but the only moment that I can be sure that it exists is when we are looking at it.  Who knows; it might disappear the minute we look away!  But, that being said, this logic seems oddly circular.  In my first paragraph, I note that information seems to be more fundamental, abstract, and ephemeral than the other manifestations of information I list, yet now I seem to say that outside the human mind there can be nothing; much less anything fundamental.

This question is somewhat related to one [i asked earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/155g51/philosophy_of_religion_why_are_we_so_bad_at_being/) about the function of religious arguments.

Pascals wager is an argument I’m fascinated with; i think it’s [not all that great] (http://pascalsbookie.tumblr.com/tagged/Pascals-Wager) but it's an interesting one none the less. Something I have always had a problem with, however, is the idea we can change our beliefs at will. Even if we realise believing in God is the better choice or we stand to lose greatly, it seems like we simply cannot will ourselves into belief. 

An example i often use is this - Imagine i took you hostage and held a gun to your head and that of your loved ones. I would shoot you all unless you form the true belief a purple elephant is in the room. It seems despite the risk, no one could.

So, do we really have a choice in what we believe? To me, it seems if all our knowledge, evidence and feelings point towards a particular thing being true, it is just so that we believe it is true. 

Hopefully you guys can provide some feedback on the flaws of this idea and what it might actually be called. Any links and/or book suggestions are much appreciated as well. I have studied philosophy before but every subject i took was philosophy of religion, so, keep the books introductory. 

[As a bonus question, in one of my courses, i read [papers by Clifford and James] (http://books.google.com.au/books?id=8Fs6SGV2zEkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). Clifford states it is wrong to believe things on insufficient evidence. One of the things i interpreted was that we should be extra careful when we are forming a belief in regards to seeking evidence and truth because such a belief can stick and will often be very hard to change later. Does this seem correct? ]

The summarization of my thought is as follows: 

1) Media is not really covering the real issue. The real issue being the root causes of these problems, such as scarcity and poor living conditions for people. Also, very little education can lead to violent crimes.

2)When people pose the argument that we need guns to protect ourselves of a possible tyranny and oppressive power, (reason behind the second amendment). I say this is foolish to think because when this is written the gun was considered the ""great equalizer"".

I don't mean the introductory sense of asking this question, which would be answered with the typical formula and a historical review of problems and positions typically discussed in the field.  Rather, I mean a metaphilosophical question which directly tackles the problem of how to determine what there is for philosophy to do on the question of knowledge, and how it is to engage in such a task.

For instance, a common project in epistemology is the conceptual analysis of the term knowledge which seeks the necessary and sufficient criteria for something to be subsumed under that concept.  But why do should we conceive the philosophical problem and the philosophical method in quite these terms?  Why isn't this merely an etymological question?  Why shouldn't the question of what knowledge is be a matter for psychologists and neuroscientists rather than philosophers?  What exactly is the problem concerning knowledge which philosophy contributes to?  And how does it contribute?  (I don't mean I'm looking for an answer to this specific question about the conceptual analysis of the term knowledge, but rather am using this to help illustrate the metaphilosophical inquiry I'm interested in, though perhaps the metaphilosophical inquiry would address these exact questions.)

Probably a lot of the relevant answers would refer to specific philosophical movements/positions.  For instance, some version of the questions I just asked have been asked in the context of naturalized epistemology.  Similarly, there are specifically Kantian or Humean or positivist positions on the meaning of epistemology and its role in philosophical inquiry.  But I'm not so much interested in reviewing these historical positions on the matter as in sources which are explicitly metaphilosophical in the sense of raising and discussing this question.

I'm particularly interested in recent-ish sources, say the past fifty years or so.

What does mathematical knowledge/insight/progress entail?,gilthoniel,11,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/x8sqo/what_is_the_basis_for_the_axioms_of_mathematics/,"Apologies for the poorly-worded question; if I knew exactly how to phrase it, I'd already know the answer. I'll do my best to explain, but I'm really going to struggle.

Essentially, I don't understand how mathematics can ever result in new knowledge. As I understand it, maths is an axiomatic system, so all a mathematical proof can achieve is to establish that ""Everything on *this* side of the equation is equal to everything on *that* side of the equation, *for no reason other than the fact that it is consistent with the axioms we have assumed*"". The body of the proof is surely just the repeated statement that ""We rephrase this relationship in *this* way, *this* way and finally in *this* way, which means that we have established that it is *definitely* consistent with the axioms we have assumed"".

Granted, if an equation incorporates elements which represent entities outside of mathematics, then I understand that it can provide a framework for predicting or explaining the behaviour of those entities, and that this constitutes new knowledge. For instance, if c is the speed of light, then every equation incorporating c tells us something about the physical behaviour of light. But as soon as we do this, we're practising physics or some other field, and no longer pure mathematics. The knowledge we have gained is about the physical world, and not about the structure of mathematics.

I think the best way to explain what I mean is to ask this: Why can't I just pick a different set of axioms and begin a field of 'alternative maths'? I understand that it wouldn't be useful for describing and predicting real-world phenomena as 'real maths' is, but then as pure as opposed to applied mathematics, why would it have to?

I should stress that I'm not trying to make some sarcastic attack on maths, along the lines of 'Maths is useless; it doesn't tell us anything about the world'. I'm fully aware that *I'm* the one who's missing something here! Again, I can only apologise for the vague, rambling and incoherent nature of this post.

So basically I believe that there lacks universal right or wrong.  But that doesn't mean I go around doing terrible things, because I have my own moral preferences, yet I recognize that my morals are simply that – a preference, no universal meaning but my own. 

However, I believe that other peoples actions,morals, and beliefs can objectively be wrong or bad, even though I believe in moral relativism.  How you ask?  Well, you can be wrong by: 

* basing your ethics on things that violate scientific truths

This makes for some interestingly twisted scenarios, such as I would not find you objectively wrong for wanting to be a totalitarian tyrant,(although my personal ethics would reject that idea) objectively, it is meaningless to say you are either right or wrong for wanting total power.  

However, if your motivations were because you believed a burning bush told you to take over the world – Then I would say that objectively, and universally you are wrong, because your ethics and morals come from a logical lapse – bushes don't speak.

You have probably learned at school that it rains because the moisture in the clouds cools and condenses into raindrops that are drawn to the earth by the force of gravity. Aristotle would have nodded in agreement. But he would have added that so far you have only mentioned three of the causes. The ""material cause"" is that the moisture (the clouds) was there at the precise moment when the air cooled. The ""efficient cause"" is that the moisture cools, and the ""formal cause"" is that the ""form,"" or nature of the water, is to fall to the earth.

Things are always hot or cold, good or bad, black or white and we assign such labels to ourselves as we feel it necessary for we feel we must label our perception of self rather than actually think ""what am I ?"". We instead think: ""well what words can I stick to myself to help me make sense to myself."" I believe this needs to change because everything you label or attempt to describe yourself as puts you in a box, in this box you further seperate yourself from others. Other people can begin to write labels on your box and differ themselves from you. But these labels mean nothing, for example, we label what we commonly know as water as ice, steam, rain, snow, hail, yet they are all the same thing. But, even water as a word is not what water is, you cannot quench thirst with the label of water, or h20, or whatever it could be referred to, only the actual THING that we labelled as water can quench the thirst.   But even when we attempt to detach something from its labels we cannot talk or even think about it without labelling it as a thing, or an it because our brains are in a way that depends on association between things. So even though it is impossible to have nameless label-less things; I believe we should attempt to minimise this when referring to ones self because the world was created to be harmonious, so the more we divide everything that it is unnecessary to divide the more we stretch the world further from how it should be. 
Instead of, for example, somebody saying ""I am a Christian"" I believe they should say they are somebody who has Christian views, because each mind is different and if you are independent you should choose to believe whatever you want to believe regardless of what religion that may fit into. To say you are ""Christian"" limits you, and makes you think, I can only believe what this box allows me to believe and I must believe everything in this box otherwise I am not in this box, I am in a different box. Which I believe to be an unhealthy way to think and live because you shackle yourself when you could be so much more free in thought than you are, and you only have yourself to blame. So instead of having agnostics and atheists and deists and people of pantheistic approach, you should simply have people with views because people grouped together for one view will almost undoubtedly differ on another so, why group them in the first place? You cannot put people, or even anything at all, into groups, you can not divide and segregate as every single thing is different, so it is pointless.
The unfortunate trouble arises when a group of people hold the same views as I because then there is the danger of us labelling ourselves as "" the people who don't believe in labels"". This is completely contradictory and defeats the entire point of the beliefs I hold. This makes us the people outside the box, which, in reality, just means we put our box in a different place. Therefore it is regrettable that I must conclude that the labelling of every possible thing we come into contact with, no matter how much I may dislike it is inescapable and inevitable.

Edit: Okay, so I think after an afternoon of arguing this out with you guys, I have an interpretation of Nietzsche's sexism w/r/t the overman: 

1. Once all the old metaphysics have fallen away (been shaken off, etc.), you're left with bodies. 

2. In a post-God world, what can save us from nihilism is a positive vision of freedom fully reconciled to embodied reality. In Nietzsche's conception, the overman would /be/ that vision embodied. 

3. Giving meaning to the world means being oriented outward towards it, which also entails being exposed to its dangers. 

4. For a woman to be overman, she would have to deny (be unreconciled with) something he saw as a defining characteristic of the female body: its orientation towards producing and protecting children. 

5. Since the overman is, by definition, reconciled with the world (of which his body is a part), and content to be totally exposed to its dangers, no woman, in Nietzsche's view, could be the overman.

Alright guys, tear the above apart! 

Disclaimer: I'm not sure I believe in the possibility for the overman, and certainly don't think that the above should translate into any conclusions about the moral status of women versus men in the world we currently live in (which is so comprehensively unreconciled with itself that it's beyond any comparison to the world of the overman.)

Now, I took a look at the available classes this semester and ""moral philosophy"" caught my eye. I think it attracts me somehow because I'm curious of how this subject will be treated at a non-naive level and because it's at the opposite of my current reference point and thus has the most potential of teaching me something new. 

It has also the potential of being something that I will hate and that will bore me to death. So I want to ask you guys: what does moral philosophy actually do in this day and age? I would suppose that it doesn't deal any more with what is right and what is wrong in an absolute sense, but every time I see an ethics question here it is exactly of that kind, so I'm not so sure.

I should go and ask the teacher, but I have a history of sounding too critical and making enemies, so it's better if I don't.

I suppose I should begin by saying that what drew me to pragmatism as a philosophy was an inclination towards scientific instrumentalism. Whilst there are obvious differences between the two, the most obvious being that they focus on generally different aspects of philosophy, it does seem that there is some cross-over. For instance, the emphasis on empirical adequacy over ontological correctness in instrumentalism mirrors the pragmatist's definition of truth; ""Any idea upon which we can ride …; any idea that will carry us prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, working securely, saving labor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true instrumentally"" (James, *Pragmatism*).

My main question, which I feel underlies my difficulty in understanding pragmatism, is whether somebody following this line of pragmatism ought to commit to scientific realism or instrumentalism. On one hand, as already discussed, the pragmatic position seems so close to the instrumentalist's that one would be forgiven for mistaking them as identical. On the other, it appears that embracing the pragmatic definition of truth would demand one to accept scientific realism as 'true'. I say this for belief in scientific realism certainly aids us in ""linking things satisfactorily, working securely, saving labor"" et cetera.

Might the pragmatist accept the assertion that scientific realism is true, but not that it is representative of reality? Are they guilty of double standards in agreeing that ""Electrons exist"" is a true statement (given its enormous pragmatic/practical benefit) and yet not necessarily believing that there are particles of matter out there in the world which correspond to the term 'electron'? Conversely, can a pragmatism hold the belief that scientific instrumentalism is false (by the pragmatic definition of truth obviously), and yet still maintain that it is the most ontologically correct/representative picture of reality?

I do apologise if it seems at times like I've accepted scientific instrumentalism straight off the bat, please forgive me for that as it's not really the part of this question which interests me.

Edit: Can I ask another quick question seeing as I don't think this warrants another thread on its own? How is the pragmatic maxim not just an early (disguised) form of verificationism (not Ayer's, but that of the Vienna Circle specifically)? James, in his *Pragmatism*, speaks not only of verification a great deal, but also of the pragmatic maxim being a criterion of meaning. Here's a quote from Peice which puts the pragmatic maxim quite concisely;

&gt;To ascertain the meaning of an intellectual conception one should consider what practical consequences might result from the truth of that conception—and the sum of these consequences constitute the entire meaning of the conception.

I've seen some responses/objections to this experiment, mostly along the lines of a 'system' argument - that no individual component of the room speaks Chinese, but the system as a whole does.

However, I've been thinking about this from a free will perspective.  Searle's room is 100% deterministic - every response is dictated by an algorithm.  Presumably, for any specific input, there is a corresponding output.  But that isn't how language works according to our intuition.  We don't think of speakers as giving outputs, we think of them as making rhetorical choices.

Beyond the stipulation that ""anything that can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence,"" has there been any serious work done on the epistemological status of purely speculative propositions that do not contradict known facts?

I guess what I would like to know is whether such speculation can really be simply dismissed as completely absurd or inconsequential, or is there possibly something more to be said about it.

It seems to me that rigorous speculation on ""ultimate reality"" does indeed contribute something to our understanding of ourselves and the world, but it's hard for me to get my head around what exactly this contribution would be. For example, if I know that I could possibly be living in a computer simulation, even though I may not have any evidence to argue that I do in fact live in such a simulation (leaving aside Bostrom's arguments in favor of this hypothesis for the moment), does not this somehow change things for me, for my undestanding/knowledge of the world, even if only in a really subtle way?

I concluded that the only functional think I could do is to learn about the world I believe I exist in.

Then, recently, I found out that there is an entire branch of philosophy dedicated to how we know called epistemology, and that it's something even professional philosophers can get pretty tied up about. So this rebooted my interest on the subject (after all, if studied philosophers hurt their brains about it, they probably already came across the same logic as I did and saw a problem with it. Or I was an exceptionally smart highschooler, that's also possible). So I'm asking if any of you can reccomend any sources, books, documentaries, whatever, on epistemology, mainly focusing on the basics of epistemology and maybe the 'next step', so to speak.

Analytic philosophers are terrible readers of continental philosophy. From Bertrand Russell who thought that Nietzsche was a war-monger and Hegel was nothing more than ""thesis-antithesis-synthesis,"" to Karl Popper who declared that Hegel was racist, statist, etc. In fact, Popper's book (The Open Society and Its Enemies) exemplifies the exact sort of attitude analytic philosophers have towards continentals: they do nothing but disturb the order of things. Chomsky has this attitude, too, in recent comments he's made about Lacan. 

What also characterizes all of these readings is that they're incredibly inaccurate and do not at all give a good depiction of the philosophy or philosopher they claim to. Nietzsche is not a war-monger, I think that *anyone* who's read Nietzsche realizes this. Walter Kaufmann (who is a rare exception: a larger analytic philosopher who points out analytic philosophies inevitable misreadings, even if his own interpretations aren't always perfect) pointed out that Russell's reading of Hegel *and* Popper's indicate that they probably never even read the works, and if they did, they completely misread it. 

BUT, it's not the same way the other way around. Michel Foucault gives compelling readings of mostly ""analytic"" modern philosophers (which is a bit anachronistic, but whatever) that I think anyone would consider at least fair. Gilles Deleuze devoted an entire book to Bertrand Russell's and Frege's theory of sense, and moreover, also wrote many books on the history of philosophy (on Kant, Leibniz, Spinoza, for some analytic readings). 

Most all of these readings, even if they critique the given philosopher, at least don't depict them as evil in some way or another. Why is it that analytic philosophers are either incredibly bad readers of continental philosophy OR incredibly hostile to it, when it doesn't seem to go the other way around?

II.2, XII)",ConclusivePostscript,14,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1gor1s/aristotles_god_final_and_efficient_cause_met_ii2/,"It is a commonplace among Aristotle scholars that the “first mover” of *Metaphysics* XII is a mover in the order of final cause. Aristotle’s God is differentiated from the Platonic demiurge, who orders pre-existing matter, and the Judeo-Christian creator God, who creates the universe ex nihilo. On this telling, God moves simply in virtue of being the perfectly desirable good, not by way of efficient causality.

However, in *Metaphysics* II.2.994a1–6 Aristotle refers to a “first principle” and claims that efficient causes cannot proceed to infinity. He argues the point (994a20–b–6) and maintains that an eternal “first principle” (994a1) or “first cause” (994b7–8) is requisite.

How do scholars reconcile the common picture of the first mover as an exclusively final cause with this passage? Is there reason not to identify this first efficient cause with the ultimate final cause of Book XII?

If I correctly remember from a philosophy paper I took a year back, there were three main contenders:

1) Hedonism - I take it this has been largely refuted by Nozick's experience machine thought experiment?

2) Preference satisfaction - but how do we account for terrible desires? Do we have to say that utilitarianism along with preference satisfaction says that it is, in theory, possible that gang-rape is OK if it maximizes utility? (which it surely never would in practice). Because I wouldn't want to concede that even in theory....

3) Objective list - but how do we non-arbitrarily decide what belongs on the list? 

We learnt that these were the 3 main theories. Has the debate today moved on, or is there a consensus, or new positions....?

Are my remembered objections the typical ones, and how strong are they?

Finally, how is the word ""happiness"" used in ethics and welfare theory? Sometimes I think people are using it to mean simply ""pleasure"", in which case saying utilitarianism prescribes maximizing happiness is too narrow a characterization. Other times happiness seems a proxy for well-being more broadly.

To me this idea means that it is never truly possibly for any two (or more) humans to understand one another. We all ask questions (such as this) and form relationships based on the assumption of understandings, where the precision of such understandings is measured on some sort of gradient. Sometimes we're so close to fully understanding that we achieve whatever the context of communication required of us and other times we are so far off that relationships crumble or hatred ensues.

Then you find out that in making this description, you cannot confine yourself to what happens inside the skin. In other words, you cannot talk about a person walking unless you start describing the floor, because when I walk, I don't just dangle my legs in empty space. I move in relationship to a room. So in order to describe what I'm doing when I'm walking, I have to describe the room; I have to describe the territory. So in describing my talking at the moment, I can't describe it as just a thing in itself, because I'm talking to you. And so what I'm doing at the moment is not completely described unless your being here is described also. So if that is necessary, in other words, in order to describe MY behavior, I have to describe YOUR behavior and the behavior of the environment, it means that we've really got one system of behavior. Your skin doesn't separate you from the world; it's a bridge through which the external world flows into you, and you flow into it.

I have been trying to grasp this concept. Does this apply to everything? One would think so, but I can't start making any example situations for myself, such as ""What is a ball? A ball is a round thing"".

I was under the impression that Aristotle's metaphysic of substance is that objects consist of matter and form.

And that therefore a mechanistic materialist would see the world as just a bunch of matter without structure (at least structure above that of physical sciences), and an Aristotelian would see it as matter structured as different objects. That structure is real on Aristotelianism, but not so on mechanistic materialism. But I've been told that this is not correct. 

So I'm trying to understand *what* mechanists/anti-Aristotelians believe, exactly, about form. Do objects such as elephants and mosquitoes really exist for a mechanist, or not?

Correct me if I am wrong or have any ideas that don't make sense etc...

Essentially, I wish to write my paper on Descartes and other ideas. I need a possible counter philosophy too. My thought process is that **I think the idea that rational thinking exists only outside of our sensory perception is wrong.**

It is rational for me to think that by clapping my hands together, a noise will be produced and I will feel a sensation on my hands.

Descartes has a Wax Argument. *""He considers a piece of wax; his senses inform him that it has certain characteristics, such as shape, texture, size, color, smell, and so forth. When he brings the wax towards a flame, these characteristics change completely. However, it seems that it is still the same thing: it is still the same piece of wax, even though the data of the senses inform him that all of its characteristics are different. Therefore, in order to properly grasp the nature of the wax, he should put aside the senses.""*

Why must a man put aside his senses to understand the wax? All that is important in the idea of the wax (at least in my opinion) is all of the information that my senses give me. To say that I must disregard my only tools for understanding seems odd to me. My senses are the only things that allow me to make sense of anything, they allow me to think. If I had to throw my senses away, why would that give me an understanding of the ""true"" idea of the wax? Wouldn't I need a sense to be able to perceive THAT?

My questions then, for AskPhilosophy are:

1. What is the importance of casting aside the senses?
2. Is it even possible to grasp the ""true"" nature of something, of the wax?
3. What philosophers go along with my idea that sensory perception is good?

As it must often happen here, I come to you with only a vague question and an ill-defined vocabulary : Sorry about that.

I would appreciate if you could give me the correct term for what is on my mind.

I am interested in learning more about (1) the process of decision making when provided with incomplete information and (2) trusting the source of this information. 

The easiest example I can think of that really illustrates what I am looking for is the voters during an election : we can't know everything about every issue yet are asked to make a decision and vote. We must do so (1) without having the full picture and we also have to (2) trust the different sources of information... and in some cases chose which of two contradicting sources we decide to trust (or neither maybe). Another example would be the relation between a non-specialist and a specialist on a topic the specialist is supposed to know something about (i.e.: Scientist, Economist, Medical doctor...)

I am simply interested in learning about those topics. I am obviously a layman so anything not in an academic paper might be more useful to me...though I think I could access some of those. The closest I could find with my googling attempt was [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality)

I'm currently reading through *Being and Time* for a class and I'm just about at chapter 4 of division II. I've had a general sense of this question all the way from the tool-analysis, but what really struck me were these lines near the beginning of chapter 3 (div. 2): “Ontologically, Dasein is in principle different from everything that is present-at-hand or *Real.* (emphasis mine) Its *'substinence'* is not based on the substantiality of a substance but on the *'self-subistence'* of the existing Self, whose Being has been conceived as care.



What is probably the easier question here is what does he mean by Real here? As far as I remember this is the first time he's used this particular term and it seems weird that he's marking some sort of distinction between it and present-at-handedness.



My main question which was spurred slightly from that passage is where Dasein actually comes from. I know the whole always already/fallenness of how Dasein finds itself as well as the null-basis of a nullity (our birth was totally contingent and our death could radically happen at any time). I also know that it is a mistake to view Dasein as ready-to-hand or present-at-hand and, as the passage above shows, it turns out to be an ontological mistake.

a. Diotima's Speech

When Socrates, through Diotima, says the real purpose of desire is giving birth in beauty, whether in body or soul, is that simply just us as humans trying to find that surrogate for immortality? From what I've gathered from Plato's ideas, the human condition is that we are a lacking, we are searching to acquire completion of ourselves and strive for a permanence we can never have. We try to transcend upwards towards wisdom, but sometimes end up downwards towards complete ignorance. Is being pregnant in soul, like a philosopher, the only way to transcend the human condition and actually reach wisdom or it is nothing for than a replacement for immortality and our desire to possess beautiful things forever? 

b. Alcibiades' Speech

Plato contrasts Socrates' beauty and Alcibiades' beauty. Does the contrast between the two beauties interlink with Diotima's speech? Diotima's speech being the theory and Alcibiades' speech being the practice. Diotima describes two types of pregnancy, the first pregnant with ideas and the second pregnant with child. Does Socrates' beauty represent the desire for wisdom and Alcibiades' just for the sexual aspect? 

c. Aristophanes' Speech

I understand the concept that we are incomplete and lacking so we search to make ourselves complete, but if we are then what can love attain?

I've been thinking about the interplay between *actual event* and *perceived event*. I'm going to pose a situation, and I'd love for you to point me toward any philosophical ideas that come to mind.

Say, in the past, Event X ""actually happened"". Now, in the present, there is insufficient evidence to know whether it was Event X that happened or Event Y that happened. Both possibilities, Event X and Event Y, it seems, are completely consistent with present day observations.

Q: Is it not then as if Event X and Event Y exist in a sort of superposition? They both *could* have happened, and until we gather enough evidence, we can never know which.

Please don't downvote me because you think I'm asking for you to do my work for me. I've already answered the first part of the question, having written that it's the Form of the Good which sheds light on objects of reason (with some added details). 

However, after having read Book VI (which the answer is supposed to be in), I have no idea what the contradictory position is... I can't seem to find anything contradictory -- it just seems like Glaucon is agreeing with Socrates about everything at this point.

Starting with the scientists decision to get out of bed in the morning and go do 'science' there are many 'scientific beliefs' that are claimed to be true, yet are not provable either in practice nor in principle using only the scientific method as we commonly understand it. And it’s cheating to say well we accept it today because we might be able to demonstrate it sometime in the uncertain future. There is absolutely no empirical way to prove the claim of the empiricist that empiricism is the only proper method of reasoning. To accept such a claim of the 'positivists' is to have 'faith' in the 'belief' that empiricism alone is the footbridge to knowledge. Even more to the point, when the principle of empirical verification is applied to itself it fails to pass its own test; i.e. that every truth claim needs observational verification from the senses otherwise it is non-sense. Since empiricism can not to this, (empiricism has no mass, no weight, no dimension) then empiricism is literally 'non-sense.’

Anyway, this dude is super studied; has like 3 pos-docs from around the globe. He has a philo-boner for Weber and we've been reading a TON of Weber. I really love his texts and went really beyond the texts he suggested. My favorite and the one I understood the best was The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. 

Soon enough we started studying Nietzsche and I saw a lot of correlation between the two ideals. He asked me to try to dig deeper but I'm having a hard time. I only read The Anti-Christ from Nietzsche and a few ""Nietzsche for dummies"" style articles. 

From what I understand; Weber defends that the spread and eventual practical world dominance of capitalism was, for the most part, due to the ethical and moral changes that protestantism brought about. From that I take that Morals come from religion; in other words, God.

Nietzsche, on the other hand, from my understanding, says that man doesn't need a higher being to provide him with a moral code. The super-ego can do that, and from there you have the super-man who is free of God. Aside from this difference, which is so obvious because they are both religiously focused texts, what are the correlations between the two? Are they adverse in other aspects? What are good texts to read to help show a dialogue between the two authors?

1. A moral obligation to do the most good for humanity over my lifetime (""good"" is well-defined in my head, at least for the purposes of this statement)
2. Personal fulfilment gained from doing things I enjoy (which, although not actively harmful, are also not the best use of my time as per #1)

I disagree and argued that we *can* know objective truths through observation.

I plan to discuss this question by first of all talking about universal ethics, before exploring the ethics behind Islam and Christianity; and finally discussing real life examples for cases that religion may bring us closer/further from universal ethics.

**Case studies I plan to use against (Religion brings us further away)**    
1) Destruction of the world trade centre - Though the terrorist are labelled as fundamentalists, it is argued that their way of thinking is strictly rational as it pertains to their religious doctrine

2) Call for the death of a girl for desecrating a Koran - Religion could allow otherwise unreasonable acts to be rationalized

**Case studies I plan to use for (Religion brings us towards)**    
1) Altruism of religion - Many aspects of religion promote love, tolerance or the pursuit of ""goodness"", which can be seen as a ethically correct behaviour to live by

2) Unity in religion - People in a religious community are more attuned to those in the same community, treatment of others in this community should be better then a relationship between two complete strangers.

The problem I am getting is that regardless of either side, the justification seems too similar. Both religious altruist and fundamentalists are driven by the authority of religion, as such, where does one make a distinction between when a act justified by religion is unethical?

Can anyone recommend philosophers/books/ideas about being religious whilst acting in ethical bounds? All comments are welcome.

With that came being taught that if I don't follow certain doctrines or hold certain beliefs, I'm going to spend eternity in Hell. I'm not angry at my parents or anyone else for raising me with this belief, as they were simply doing what they saw as the best thing to do.

However, I'm at a point in my life where I can't simply accept these religious values anymore, and have begun to challenge these religious notions through fields such as philosophy. However, I'm struggling to approach many texts with an open mind, as I can't completely let go of my beliefs in God, not because I really want to believe, but because of the fear of eternity in Hell that has been instilled in me.

So my question is if there are any philosophers or texts that deal with fear of religion? I'm not looking for something to simply disprove God and convert me to atheism; I just want something to give me a little more perspective on these matters, and help me overcome certain fears that I wish to overcome so that I may better search for philosophical truth. I'm currently reading Descartes *Discourse on Method*, and am finding it very interesting, but am wondering what else is out there.

Edit: I just want to say that this upbringing has not made me anti-religious. I'm in no way mad at my parents for raising me the way I did.

Graduate philosopher who specialised in Philosophy of Science here. I'm about to go on to do an MSc, and during my course I want to go to a local primary school and teach philosophy to the kids there for an hour a week.

The way I was going to do it was to take 'big' philosophical ideas and condense them into a short story, then talk to the kids about what the story means and what they think about the issue raised. Obviously, they're not going to be able to publish a paper at the end of it, but I firmly believe that the reason philosophy is important is that it's universal; anyone can understand the issues if they are presented clearly enough, and that philosophy is important instrumentally to make you a better thinker.

An easy example is Theseus' ship - I could tell a story about this ship, and the captain who boasts ""Its the oldest ship still afloat"", then describe how he had to replace the mast because of weevils, and most of the crew have retired, and the bottom has to be replaced every few years. I'd ask the kids whether they think it *is* the same ship, and why they think it is or isn't. I'll talk to them about how their bodies are constantly changing, and ask if bodies are like ships. If I'm feeling particularly teachery I might get them to make a 'Theseus' Ship' out of lego and change it *just enough* that their contraption is a 'different' lego model to before. Nothing that will shake the field to its foundations, but also probably something the kids won't have thought about before which is hopefully interesting for them and gets them to think about philosophy come degree-picking time.

Unfortunately, because I specialised in philosophy of science (which is awesome) I feel I might be missing out on 'big ideas' in other areas of philosophy - if you could post your favourite 'big idea' or philosophical problem it would be good to see if there's any consensus on what are the biggest and most interesting problems to study. Obviously it's not that I don't know about other areas, I just tend to get excited by the ones which have relevance to my pet subjects and ignore the ones which don't. Double points if you can write me a short story that a 10 year-old will understand that highlights the issue(s) you're talking about.

In the interests of full disclosure, points may look suspiciously like upvotes, and double points might look exactly the same as any other kind of points. But I promise I'll post my lesson plans here when I've written them up in case anyone wants to have a look.

Edit: I also assume that I can't ask the kids to contemplate killing someone, which makes medical ethics and trolley-problem type problems pretty much off limits unless someone much more creative than me can come up with a way to recast them to merely present inconvenience rather than fatalities.",,False,,t5_2sc5r,1344593414.0,,,True,t3_xznbp,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/xznbp/biggest_philosophical_ideas/,

Given that the requisite condition is her passion, we might decide that she cannot have acted with intent in this moment.
