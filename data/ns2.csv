Everything about the game would've been enough to get me hooked, but the thing that sold the game for me was the community.

In other multiplayer games, the community can be very uncooperative and downright mean spirited towards new players. However, playing this game, everyone was very open and willing to teaching me the game -- telling me what buildings do and being very willing to follow orders, trusting my judgement despite the fact that I was so new.

Another aspect that I feel is more unique to me is the fact that the people playing this game seem to be very open to younger gamers. I've always been afraid to use my mic when online, due to the sheer hatred that people feel towards teenagers in the gaming community, but to my surprise, the people playing Natural Selection didn't simply tolerate the fact that I was young -- they welcomed it, encouraging that I use my mic and supporting me when the few people who disagreed with letting me play spoke their mind.

I started to play commander very early on, and due to the support and advice of all the players, I was able to quickly master it, and I became the best commander on the server within a couple of matches.

Withing 48 hours of owning the game, I managed to play it for 21 -- And the only reason I don't even have even more hours logged is because I got sick.

I just wanted to say thank you to all the people playing the game during the free weekend and the days following -- I'm sure that you encouraged many people to play and ultimately buy the game -- and thank you to the amazing community for single-handedly taking this game from a great game to an amazing game.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,gmarine,True,t3_1b28p7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1b28p7/recently_bought_ns2_love_the_community/,

1357641296.0,92,self.ns2,166ei3,Some tips for new commanders,Gmarx,109,17,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/166ei3/some_tips_for_new_commanders/,"Here's some advice/tips/facts for new commanders, mostly for Marine comm since it is a bit more demanding. Apologies in advance if I misquote res costs, and if some of these are too basic for you.

**General Stuff**

* Use a mic.
* If you are worried about criticism, politely announce that you are inexperienced as a commander. Most people will be quite a bit more understanding when they know you are new.
* A resource tower gives you one resource every 6 seconds.
* Some people (NS1 vets?) refer to both harvester and extractor simply as ""RT"".

**As Marine commander**

* You start with 45 res. That is enough to build (2) extractors, (1) armory, and (1) observatory. Which sets you up for getting phase tech.

* If you have less than 8 marines, don't build a second Infantry Portal (IP) until you actually need it, or if you smell a skulk rush to your base.


* In Pubs, rush phase tech unless you have exceptional marines who have told you they'd rather have quick mines + armor 1/weapons 1. This is pretty much only seen at the competitive level though.
* Phase tech is researched at the Observatory. You will then have to build actual Phase Gates to start ""teleporting.""
* Unless you've discovered a brilliant early-robo strategy (hint: you haven't), please don't build turrets earlier than 5 minutes into the game. A Robotics factory costs 15 res, and each nest of (3) turrets costs 20 res. If you have two techpoints with turrets at each, that is 55 res. To put that in perspective, 55 res could have bought you phase tech + (2) phase gates + (1) armory at your new base.
* Every phase gate is both an entrance and an exit. I only bring this up because I've actually seen comms build 2 phase gates in the main base, thinking each would take them to a different exit.
* On the subject of mines: they are great. Getting your team to actually buy them is a whole 'nother problem though. My tip is that you (the comm) start with 20 res just like everyone else. If you have researched mines, buy a pack yourself and lay them where you see fit.
* Don't research shotguns in the first couple minutes without asking if your team will actually buy them. Most people won't. Even then, the only reason to get shotguns that early is to shotty rush the hive (which is a very all-in strategy). In early-game, the cost of shotgun research is better spent elsewhere (ie.- armory/obs/phase in 2nd base).
* Hotkey each observatory (select observatory and hit cntrl + #). The keyboard shortcut for distress beacon is ""s"". That way, when your power node is rushed, you can hit ""1-s"" and know that a beacon is happening.
* On the subject of bacon, a distress beacon will teleport all live marines to the nearest **command center**. Not the observatory which activated it. For instance on Mineshaft, an obs in Central Drilling will beacon to Deposit CC. Or on Veil, an obs in Overlook will beacon to Sub-Sector (same with The Neck-Pipeline). This comes in handy when you realize that alien attacks on Sub generally come from System Waypointing, and Pipeline attacks generally come from Utility. Note - an observatory that is powered (i.e.- Overlook) can beacon to an unpowered CC nearby (Sub-Sector).

* On the subject of building placement, I usually try to place large structures like armories and phase gates near walls, in order to preserver a large, open ""firing"" line for most marines. Those of you who have tried to kill a skulk in Shipping (Tram) in that lousy confined base might be able to relate. Although, having an armory in open space allows marines to dance around it and be healed enough to reload and shoot the skulk chasing him.
* Learn the keyboard shortcuts for assistance. Ammo (E-A), Health (E-S), Nano-shield (E-D), Observatory Scan (E-F).
* Pressing [space] will snap to the marine that called for health/ammo using q/z, respectively. When I hear the sultry lady tell me a marine needs health, I immediately press Space-E-S, and at my next click, a health pack will appear. My marines generally don't wait more than 2 seconds for commander candy.
* Placing ammo directly on a marine is not always best. Sometimes they have run dry on LMG ammo, and have already switched to the Pistol. If you drop the ammo directly on them, it will refill their currently held weapon instead of the LMG. When in doubt, drop it immediately in front of them.
* A single ammo drop will completely refill a weapon's ammo. Many comm's incorrectly (but understandably) believe 1 box = 1 clip.
* If marines are on the move and are requesting health/ammo, drop it ahead of them instead of trying to perfectly place them on top of them. This motivates them to continue moving forward, and they won't miss stuff that dropped behind them.
* More shortcuts: Extractor (Q-S), Armory (Q-F).
* ARCs (those tank things) can shoot through walls. This requires line of sight to the target either through direct Marine vision, or a scan.
* If you have good aim, don't be afraid to hop out of the chair to deal with that pesky skulk chomping on your power node. If you can't aim, or there are other skulks nearby, or for any other reason think you will die when you hop out, don't do it. If you die, there will be no one to trigger a beacon if necessary.
* Dropping 30 scans in 10 seconds at the last hive is a great way to celebrate a victory.
* Lastly, this isn't Starcraft. Please don't build a second CC in the first 2 minutes. No reason to fast expand unless you are trying some quirky strategy. We're not here to 1Rax-FE or CC-First.

**Edit 1**:
[TycoCelchuuu has reminded me about the armor 1 / weapons 1 debate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/166ei3/some_tips_for_new_commanders/c7tc0sd?context=3) Tyco has a youtube channel. I'm in his marine commander tutorial video, which makes me feel special (as a different username). Anyways, here's a knowledge bomb on A1/W1:

**Armor 1 (A1)**: Marines at a0 have 160 effective health (100 health + 30 armor, 1 armor = 2 health). At a1, they have 200 effective health (100 health + 50 armor). A perfect skulk bite does 75 damage, and parasite does 10 damage. 3 perfect bites deals 225 damage, killing a marine regardless of whether he has a0 or a1. However, Parasite + 2 perfect bites will exactly kill an a0 marine (160 damage done), but an a1 marine would survive. At A2 (240 effective health), a marine can survive 3 perfect bites.

**Weapons 1 (W1)**: Regardless of whether you have w0 or w1, it takes the same number of lmg shots to kill a skulk. The only advantage W1 brings is that it takes one less shotgun pellet to kill a skulk.

So does that mean you should get A1 before W1? I think so. Yes, most pub skulks won't parasite, and most won't land perfect bites. But most people don't buy shotguns until JP's are available, at which point you probably have W3. When in doubt, A1-W1-W2-W3-A2-A3.


**Edit 2**:
 [Kordie has reminded people to use nano-shield on buildings, I concur.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/166ei3/some_tips_for_new_commanders/c7tghf9?context=3)


**As Alien Commander**

* In the early-game, don't cyst more than you have to, each cyst costs 1 res. Again, this isn't Starcraft, and infestion =/= creep. You don't get vision of stuff walking over infestation (although you do get a smokey cloud effect). I know that most rookies can't help but shoot cyst, but if you want map vision, use drifters instead. 

* Use **drifters**. Place them at important chokes. For instance on ns2_Veil this would be System Waypointing, East/West Junctions, The Neck, The Dome, Overlook. All other maps have a central locations, in which a drifter should always be there at the very least. Experience will tell you where to place other drifters. Also, drifters currently have no collision model, so marines can't accidentally bump into them (this might be changed eventually). They can, however, accidentally shoot them.

* Also, drifters can be rallied from the hive. Select the hive, and right click anywhere on the map. When a drifter is built, it will go there. Useful for if you are diligent enough to buy drifters, but always find 5 at your hive being kind of useless. With a rally, you might find 5 drifters being redundantly useful at Hub/Central Drilling/Courtyard/Crossroads, but at least you can quickly send them to useful locations.

* When in doubt, go celerity first.

* If you choose camo first, you'd better secure and lock down 2 other hive points fast. If you can only secure 1 extra hive, you will be assaulting a marine base with Onos that have camo + (celerity/carapace). Since that base will have an observatory, camo is rendered useless. An Onos without carapace is not very intimidating. An Onos without celerity has a difficult time retreating.

* Please don't ever upgrade shade as your second hive. For similar reasons as above.

* Use drifters. The drifter ability ""Enzyme"" increases alien attack speed by 25% for (6?) seconds. Useful for hitting observatories, phase gates, and power nodes. Very tough to remember to actually bring a drifter in such attacks though. Which is why it is good to practice building and placing drifters everywhere; you'll always have one nearby.

* Regarding Enzyme: it is an Area of Effect ability (as opposed to Point-Based AoE; I believe I'm using these terms correctly). You click on the drifter (ideally it is hot-keyed) click on Enzyme (or use the shortcut ""z"") and click anywhere on the map near the drifter. The drifter will shoot a red dart a pop some red dust. Any alien in the radius of the dust will receive Enzyme effect for whatever the duration is. I address this to correct the misconception that some may have that Enzyme is only popped around the drifter itself (much like Ink or Healing wave function on Shades and Crags, respectively). This functionality makes Enzyme much easier to use in practice.

* In the early game, don't buy whips. Each whip costs 15 res. I've seen khaam's panic drop 3 whips at a hive, which is enough for another hive or dropping a lerk/fade egg (depending on how many hives you have).

* Don't forget you start with 20 res. That is enough to go gorge and drop hydras (either in base to protect hive/upgrades or the nearest harvester). Also, consider concealing your upgrade structures in clogs. It won't buy you more than a couple seconds, but sometimes that makes all the difference. Or if the marine is inexperienced enough, he might not be suspicious of a random assortment of clogs at your hive.

* Also, don't be afraid to hop out of the hive to deal with that pesky marine axing your upgrades.


If you actually read all that, thanks!

TL;DR: Don't buy turrets, don't buy whips, buy drifters.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,1357687663.0,,,True,t3_166ei3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/166ei3/some_tips_for_new_commanders/,

I was always on the fence about getting this game and was really excited when the free weekend was announced and hopped on as soon as I could. 

Like most newbies this weekend, I had no clue what I was doing. My teams would be all spread out, everything seemed to kill me instantly and the few players who weren't free week would be yelling at the newbies for things that made no sense. Commander after commander was silent and unhelpful. I was on the verge of uninstalling because it just wasn't fun.

Then we got a new commander named VIGIL who was a complete change. This commander went out of his way to explain super basic things like what jetpacks were and why you always want one or how to use bile bombs to demolish a base. He never lost his cool at anyone for making a mistake and worked with them to teach them not to make the same mistake again (even when I couldn't find the power node in a room and lost a push for our team.) 

The game actually started to become fun. Instead of running around aimlessly our heard of newbies actually started to work together and get objectives and we had some really awesome games. 

That good commander singlehandedly turned me from uninstalling to loving and buying the game and I'm sure there's other freeweekers just like me who joined purely because a commander took the time to guide them.

So to VIGIL and to all the other commanders that took the time to guide us new players THANK YOU!

Have a little patience with the new guys, they need us to learn! Over the past couple of days I have seen several experienced players join a server and  start bashing rookies because they ""do not know what they are doing"".

I know we constantly tell the rookies to speak up and ask questions, but the reality is that they are new and are most likely afraid to speak up. Be vocal and call things out. Give reasons as to why the team should do what you're asking. This is a simple concept but it goes a long way in teaching this game.

Example: I was commanding a mixed group of rookies on Docking. My team was listening but they just needed some extra guidance. Then joins a relatively veteran player. First thing he says ""god rookies have ruined this game""... Next thing I notice he is screaming at the team ""Bar and Cafe are getting hit!"". The team does not really react. After recapping it happens another time and the team does not respond. Veteran player: ""See! This is why I hate rookie games!"" and he proceeds to rage and leave the server, over two lost rts &gt;&lt; .... 

After a brief moment of silence, I calmly explain to my team that the angry gentleman had the right idea, but he was not able to articulate what he wanted in a way for rookies to understand. All he had to say, and what I said to my team at that time, was: ""If you look at your map (tell them to press C), Bar and Cafe are behind our front lines. The aliens are getting behind and killing our Extractors. We need at least one or two people to respond to this. This is important because if we lose extractors, we gain less resources, and winning is all about resources. Also, make sure only one or two people react. If the whole team falls back to protect Bar and Cafe, then we will have no one on the front line (then some brief explanation of the fastest ways to get there).""

This took me all of 20 seconds to say. Immediately four rookies spoke up, some who hadn't been using their mics, saying that they now understand what the request was and how thankful they were that someone spelled it out for them. They were stoked they could contribute.

Many seem to forget this and i watch as new players frustratedly die over and over again running head on on the ground into heavy marine fire.

If you want to survive *and* get kills as a skulk, use your mobility to your absolute advantage!

**Don't move to attack across the ground level** 

Running along the ground is what rookie marines expect. All their weapons will already be aimed at around knee level so you'll be running into a wall of death. In the same vein...

**You auto-attach to walls and the ceiling, use this ability constantly:** 

Your movement, if possible, should always be from wall to ceiling to another wall without running along the ground level. If you constantly move in this manner you have a much higher chance at surviving a surprise encounter with a marine as they often expect ground level attacks.

**Attack Vertically, not Horizontally** 

Given that you've followed the first two tips, this should be simple. Your attacks should come in from above your opponent as often as possible. Dropping in makes your opponent track across the vertical access which in my experience is much more difficult for many than tracking across the y. By jumping from ceiling to bite to wall to ceiling and attacking again you force your opponent to swivel in a wide circle, giving your teammates a chance to flank and yourself more time to destroy the target.

**Ambush tactics are the best tactics**

Skulks have millions of places to hide and each marine only has one field of view. Instead of rushing down a hallway into that squad of marines consider having *one* skulk on your team lure into your room then attacking at once when they get halfway in. Skulks are individually weak, but as a unit they are amazingly proficient at separating and destroying.

edit: Forgot one:

**Turn out the Lights**

Marines, with their pitiful human eyes, need light to see. Due to the glory of superior evolution aliens have a form of heat/nightvision. When attacking a large area with a pack of marines incoming, instruct your teammates to rush the power node down to one bite left then take ambush positions. When the marines come streaming in, wait till they make it to about the halfway point of the area then finish the node. Even with their flashlights marines will be at an extreme disadvantage during the 30 or so seconds before the hazard lights activate in the area. Use this time to pick off marines with their flashlights off, marines that have separated to run to safety, and generally as a natural form of invisibility when planning your hit and run attacks.

**By [eisbaer66](http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/12ilbw/skulk_tips/c6vd4d8):**

**Make your bites count**

Don't go into a bite frenzy when you attack. You are better of getting on the next wall/ceilling and start a new attack, then biting nothing but air while the marine is jumping in and out of your field of view.

Also try to look slightly up when you approach a marine, because he will start to bunny hop as soon as you're near enough to threaten him. And its hard to keep track of him, if you're watching the floor ;)

Natural Selection 2 is a lot better with a community. We have a couple pretty good ones. We have all 3 listed on the right side of the subreddit.

Join [r/ns2 steamgroup](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ns2reddit) and join the steam chat. We have a friendly and helpful community. We have 3 NA servers going at the moment and we do PUGs (pick up games) every Wednesday. Friday the 21st we'll try to do some pugs to help the newbies learn a bit. Join the steam group and download mumble. 

We'll be doing a lot of pugs this fri-sat as long as people keep showing up. We will start around 7pm est whenever we have enough to pick teams.

I'm working on www.ns2hub.com with a few great people from the community and I'd recommend anyone interested in ns2 bookmark it. We'll be updating it a lot with info on what is going on in the community and we'll keep it posted with events.

edit: This is more than just a plug for the steam group. We really have a great active community and it's the best way to get into this game. Playing on random public servers just isn't the best way to experience this game.

What a lot of people don't know, however, is that when a power node is still just a blueprint it can't be damaged. This means if you leave it at 99% then build your phase, extractor, etc, all you have to do is run by the power node and tap E to build it. What this prevents is if the aliens show up and kill you before that, they can't destroy the power node saving you valuable time on your next attempt at capturing that room.

Here's something you rookies should know: No one cares if you are new as long as you speak up.  If you don't communicate, people are going to get mad at you, especially if you are the commander.

NS2 players are all more than willing to help out rookies, I know I am. If you hop in the command chair and actually have a microphone or type a lot, we WILL help you. But if you just jump in the chair, start dropping random items while ignoring all of the advice people are trying to give, people are going to just get mad and yell at you. If you don't respond to people asking ""can you hear us"" ""drop this"" ""do this then this"", people are going to get mad at you. We already know that you have next to no clue what you're doing. People want to help you, but only if you are willing to listen. In the past. I've had rookie commanders drop random items and not listen to people, only to be ejected. And then the ejected rookie will actually start shit talking the team for ejecting them.

Generally, it's a pretty bad idea to jump in the chair anyway if you're new, especially marines, although now that alien commanding requires more than a pulse, it's not a great idea to jump in the chair either.  Good commanders are crucial to winning a game, especially as marines, where med packs and ammo are readily available to drop.

Say something! If you say you need help, we will help you! There are no noob questions, this can be a very complex and difficult game to even be decent at. It's not like your typical FPS at all, if you say nothing, if you don't communicate, THAT'S when you get people raging at you.  I literally turn into tutorial bot when there's an flux of rookies, just saying ""press b to open your evolution page!"" ""make sure to weld your follow teammates when their armor is low!"" ""build the power node before building anything else!""

Ask tons of questions.  We'll help you.  In fact, ask questions here, I'll answer anything.  Also, especially if you're new, check out this incredibly extensive video my friend made.

The booth was smack dab in the middle of the indy gaming exhibit where we had a couple of interested on-lookers. 

From the vibe there, I garnered what the players were most interested in. It wasn't that asymmetrical gameplay or the badass higher lifeforms and technology, but it was the fact that there was a commander playing in a starcraft style manner leading a team who were most familiar with FPS. Also, the interaction between teammates and the commander personally giving you keys to the exosuit had players much more invested into the game. The UWE staff was friendly with teaching new players how to play a lifeform, or command a team.

So how can we improve the 10 minute play-by experience? Most people with give the game a try, and then move on to the next booth without ever picking up a shotgun/jetpack or a higher lifeform. 

I suggest that the UWE team make a modded 5v5 game specifically for PAX exhibitions. There should be an admin that can take control of the tide of battle by allowing new players that are just dropping in to give the fade a try or be able to use higher technology. This will allow the player to see what the game really has to offer. 

What other suggestions would you give UWE to improve the 10 minute PAX booth experience?

It wasn't just a stalemate game. We based traded several times. We were about to lose at about the 30 min mark as they deployed 4 duals but luckily be and one other guy were able to go Onos at the same time and we had 3 other people willing to go Gorge without fussing. Held them off in Cargo for about another 20 mins as they kept sending waves and waves of Mechs at us. Eventually we got most of their mech.

They then sneaked attacked our second hive in Pipe with about 10 Arcs. Destroyed that hive but we did get their arcs. In the counter push we were able to destroy Control but had to rush back to Cargo and go their as it was destroyed. Finished off the mech and inf in Cargo rebuilt hive but in the process they rebuilt control. It seemed like eventually they just ran out of res.

I just never died as Onos which probably saved the game since we needed every single Onos to win that game. Pretty surprising since most games are decided in the first couple mins and that was my first true long game where it could have gone either way.

Sorry, about the little story but man it was amazing. You really don't get that type of intense and satisfying moments in other FPS. I think at the end I had 60 kills and over 1000 points.

Looks like he's been hacking for a few days now. Would love to see a VAC ban or Steam ban happen, if not hopefully server admins view r/ns2.

Steam profile is [corruptconvergence](http://steamcommunity.com/id/corruptconvergence/).
Steam ID: 11685468

My [Fraps recording](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFX9mnmCc6Q&amp;feature=youtu.be). Dead giveaway @ 1:20 mark.

Names that he has used so far: Mg | IDONOTMISS, AIMBOTbob, OBAMACARE, Zobot3, [OSS] JMX, [OrC] Nemesis, YOU GOT OWNED, [FAIL] Noob. He usually has someone else with him that is not hacking, but just trolling as well. Usually wears the same made up clan name or has a similiar name, ie. Zobot2. I wouldn't doubt he could part of the same group that goes around trolling servers via the command chair or DDoS attempts.

EDIT: If all I'm doing is giving this guy attention and this post isn't going to lead to a ban let me know and I'll delete this all. I feel as though most of these trolls do this for the pure enjoyment of making people angry.

Another edit: I've done some crazy internet Watson detective work. I've found the user corruptconvergence to be connected with another user named Jokerzd or Jokerzds via this [2007 post](http://forums.celtx.com/viewtopic.php?p=32958) on some random writing forum.

This way you'll have games that are MORE even, which is better for everyone: good players will get challenging games and new players won't be destroyed by a stacked team of good players. I think it would be a good step towards addressing the issue of player retention.~~

~~This is what you need to do:~~

~~- have an option under vote called: balanced teams~~
~~- if enough players vote yes, the system forces the teams~~

~~The way the system works is that it splits players based on the scores that they got from last round. So if you have players with the scores 200, 150, 100 and 75, it will place the 200 with the 100 player and the 150 with the 75 player. So you keep doing this until the readyroom is empty. For players with tied scores or 0 as their score, it reverts to random assignment for those players.~~

~~It's not perfect, but at this point, it's better than completely random, which can still stack teams. I play many games of NS2 and out of maybe every 3 games, only 1 of them turns into a really close and exciting match. The other games turn into egg-locked aliens or marines that can't hold onto more than 2 resource towers.~~

~~And before you say this system sounds weird... **It's been used in pretty much all of the Call of Duty games for years.**~~

~~Please UWE, as a frequent NS2 player, make this happen.~~

~~**EDIT:** I've responded to some posts that have concerns. I would like to remind people that I'm not saying this is the BEST solution for balanced teams, but that it's a first step... a step better than simply randomizing teams. One of my goals was to make it super easy to implement so that the devs could easily add it to the game without attaching an entire database to it (though they could do that later... but we want things NOW). To the people complaining about not being able to play with friends... my system works exactly the same as randomize teams, meaning you can still f4 and try to join a friends team. And FINALLY, this is a vote system, so if people do not want to use it... VOTE.~~

~~I've also thought up a better version of this system: If you have 8 players on the server ranked in order of ABCDEFGH, you would have the system place players like this: team 1 gets A, team 2 gets B, then the system alternates with C going to team 2, then D going to team 1, team 1 getting E, team 2 getting F, team 1 getting H and team 2 getting G. So the teams will look like this:~~

~~Team 1 - ADEH~~

~~Team 2 - BCFG~~

**EDIT2:**

**It seems that this is already implemented in the game!** Try it yourself! Go to a server, play a game and then turn on random. Press tab and see the scores of the players. I don't think it's coincidence as to what results I am getting. Apparently, the good players are split up down the middle. I have not seen a game where the system put 5 of the best players on one team in a 20 player game.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,1371339114.0,,lerk,True,t3_1g48u4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1g48u4/random_teams_is_a_good_first_step_but_lets_go/,

I still didn't know my asshole from my elbow, so I joined one of the rookie servers.

The first marine team I was on was pretty fun, everyone was fairly new, but a few good voices provided some semblance of direction. The next alien team I was on was... horrible. Just abusive people, mocking people for not knowing what they were doing, harping on them over and over, it was pretty gross.

Worst part? No one really said anything to shut them up. From my experiences in other online games, I've learned a solid lesson: protect your noobs. They may irritate you at first, but if you want your game to thrive, protect your noobs. If you hear someone abusing a rookie, don't even bother feeding the troll, but spare a few words of encouragement for the new guys. It'll make the game better for everyone.

I'll stick with it for awhile longer, but I sure hope I meet some nicer people.

I find in many games, one team gets stacked. In most it's the marines that are more popular. What this does in the ready room is have a group of people sitting in the marine spawn area waiting for someone to go alien, or pop into random and get put on alien by the matchmaker. Maybe I'm the only one who sees that as an issue, but random is kinda silly when you can press tab and see exactly where it is going to put you, and a stack of guys in spawn make sure the game won't start evenly.

My proposal is this; a random team. Basicaly before the game starts anyone that picks random is put into a ""random team"" and then get distributed to marines and aliens randomly when the game starts. This could be extended into the early moments of a game by having the random team form and distribute players every 30sec or so. Once the game is more than 5 minutes in, I can't see a real need for this.

Thoughts?

*edit* after a bit of discussion, the extended ""random team"" seems kinda unnecessary. So just a ""random team"" at the start that would distribute the players in it when the match begins.

It seems to not have spread yet, since I've never seen it in NA pubs, r/ns2 pugs or any of the streams that I watch.

It's basically a rush for sentries and MACs, that are used for holding down key map points in the early game to try and stop the aliens from ever getting a second hive (and bile bomb). It sounds crazy and I'm still not convinced it is such a good strategy, but I like seeing something different so I'd like to see what the people here think of it.

The first time I saw it was as alien on Tram and I laughed since, obviously, 4-5 MACs and a sentry nest were such a huge waste of res just to hold down the Elevator tech point. They killed me and I just told the comm to switch focus to repair, and I would build up the second hive there as gorge.

About a minute later, I'm alone building up the new Repair hive and I see a MAC train moving in, instantly building up a sentry nest next to me. I desperately tried to shoot down the battery, but the MACs just repaired it way faster than spit could damage it and I died again. That's when I realized we had already lost the game, because as skulks, lerks and bile-bomb-less gorges there is no way in hell we could out-DPS the MACs' healing rate while avoiding sentry fire. Soon, there were sentry and MAC nests on both sides of Shipping hive, trapping us in.

In that game, the alien team was a bit green so maybe we took too long to get enough res for the hive drop. The next time I saw this strategy being played I was on the marine side on Veil and we ended up losing because the aliens were able to take down our main base while we tried to secure tech points without phase gates. We easily secured both sub-acess and pipe, but the base rush and res situation stopped us from continuing the expansion.

Of course, as soon as the aliens are able to upgrade bile bomb, they get the hard counter for this strategy. A single gorge can easily take down these nests and PG-less marines are extremely vulnerable.

So, it is definitely possible to counter this strategy as aliens, but I'm curious to see how it would work out with two reasonably experienced teams. I believe that an agressively-expanding marine team could grab enough RTs early on to make this viable, but it is an all-in push. If enough MACs and sentries go down, it is very likely GG since this will put the marines so far behind the usual tech curve that they could be overwhelmed.

Run up walls and on the ceiling and jump around a lot. Also don't hold down bite when fighting marines, instead only bite when you think you are within range. This will immediately extend your average life as a skulk. 

Gorge: Don't think you can solo a marine, cause you can't if he's moderately decent. Stay behind your skulks and other lifeforms and support them and bail as soon as they die or flee.

Lerk: Do not fly in straight lines! Weave and bob to try and avoid fire. Also in the beginning don't think you can take on marines by yourself, as it takes a good lerk to do that. Support and stay close to your skulks and other lifeforms and bail if they die or flee.

Fade: You will do much better as a fade in the beginning if you treat him solely as a hit and run lifeform and not take a straight up fight with marines. Blink in, hit, then bail and let the skulks clean up. Skulks are free, fades most certainly aren't.

Onos: Do not overcommit! And under most circumstances if you are starting to get to half health it is better to bail than to risk losing a 75 res investment. Also don't think you can solo an entire base by yourself if you are new to playing the onos, as you will most likely just die. An onos can be incredibly important to keep alive for the team so treat it with care.

1351953132.0,32,self.ns2,12kc7w,The two steps you should take as Aliens in the beginning of a game.,Draaaan,38,6,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/12kc7w/the_two_steps_you_should_take_as_aliens_in_the/,"I've seen as many skulks hiding across the map from the action as I can take, and I really think something like this needs to be outlined for new players. Aliens are far from underpowered, and one of their greatest strengths is their ability to expand from their base without having to devote players to building their structures.

**Step one: Find the base!**

Unless you're gorging it up from the get-go, you should never be doing anything other than figuring out where the marines spawned. That means no waiting in vents for them to come to you and no running off into pointless hiding spots. **Once you find it, call it out**. It's very easy to tell where their base is after spotting your first marine--they can typically only expand in two directions. Once you hear someone call out their location, waste no time getting there. That's where all of the action will be, and you need to be sure you're in position for step 2.

**Step two: Deny attempts to expand, and starve them of resources**

You're far too under-equipped to go charging into the base already. What you need to do is push them back to the entrances of their base, and **just wait**. While they're stuck on minimal resource nodes, your commander should be having a field day with his expanding. Do not chase, and do not over extend. Just prevent them from moving out. Make sure they aren't able to sneak out from the other side and begin expanding in that direction--it doesn't hurt to do a sweep around to other resource nodes on the other side to be safe. The longer you keep them holed up the better, even if they eventually break free.

I feel like a lot of people I keep bumping into are taking the tips telling aliens to be stealthy way too seriously--charging out in the open is bad, yes, but please don't spend the entire beginning of the game finding that ""perfect spot"" to sit and wait while the marines take the rest of the map.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,,True,t3_12kc7w,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/12kc7w/the_two_steps_you_should_take_as_aliens_in_the/,

I can't seem to find it on the site or the forums.~~  Change log has just been posted!  As follows:

**Features**

* Added alien commander ability called Catalize. This speeds the evolution, building or researching of any player or structure for 10 seconds. Adjusted Hive energy and increased Hive build time, shell/veil build times and evolution research times somewhat to account for it.
* Moved bile bomb from Gorge to Lerk.
* Lerk spores now slowly float down to the floor.
* Reduced the time at which subsequent eggs spawn in bigger player-number games to try to fix the close spawn problem (Repair Room and Shipping)
* Changed GUI items to scale text (if a scale is specified)
* New Cyst and Mini-Cyst model.
* Wounded players or structures are now indicated in the Gorge HUD.
* Added icons for each weapon type for the pickup icon user interface.
* Added new Veil upgrade: Silence
* Changed alien evolution model: now each upgrade structure (Shell, Veil, Spur) can be upgraded to support exactly one upgrade (Carapace, Regeneration, etc.). Then aliens can choose that evolution, which will be at full power. This is much simpler than the previous ""scalable"" model where the number of chambers indicated the power of the upgrade (and it wasn't used anyways).
* The Mature Whip will now auto attack targets with Bombard if they are nearby but not close enough to whack (Thanks Matso!)

**Fix**

* Distress Beacon will only respawn players next to a built Command Station (not unbuilt).
* Fixed a bug where spit could slow a Marine by 80% (should have been 50%)
* Fixed discrepancies between the server and client animations when checking if bullets hit.
* Fixed bug causing a script error sometimes when issuing an order to an AI unit.
* Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause problems on round reset.
* Fixed a bug where Skulks could not climb up a wall when camouflaged or walking (thanks Matso!)
* Scan will now always reveal units in range.
* Manufactured units (MAC, ARC, Drifter) play now a different sound when completed.
* Nanoshield will not consume energy anymore on failed attempts.
* Fixed bug where camouflage was canceled when wall walking + holding shift.
* Flying AI units (drifters, MACs) can now fly over structures in case they would completely block their way.
* Onos will not gain momentum anymore when going backwards.
* Ghost mines model will no longer stay on screen when picking up a weapon when mines are selected.
* Fixed bug where way point sounds for Marines won't play sometimes and could be spammed.
* Fixed bug where flames are always visible to Alien Commander.
* Fixed bug where Marine Commander could not manually socket a power node without dropping a structure nearby.
* Fixed camouflage slow walking for Fade and Skulk.
* Fixed script error that sometimes occurred when a grenade was whacked by a Whip.
* Check that the entity hasn't been deleted before calling OnThink.
* Fixed a couple of cases where the Pistol would stop shooting.
* Fixed bug where the Whip would move a bit on it's own right after finishing construction.
* Fixed bug preventing the health of a connected Phase Gate from displaying to non-Commander players.
* Changed ground jumps for Skulks to only modify y velocity. in rare situations the Skulks y axis could have been off and cause accelerating when spamming jump on ground.
* Added a minimap blip for the Phase Gate.
* Fixed bug preventing the Crag Umbra ability from playing a sound.
* Fixed bug allowing ""use"" on structures when not close enough to their ""use"" area (Command Station for example)
* Fixed a bug where you could shadow step during blinking.
* Fades won't get stuck anymore in the jump animation after blinking.
* Fixed bug where shadow step + blink used at the same moment resulted in insane speed increase.
* Detect &amp; protect against a race condition in PhysX.
* Reduced general air friction. fixes problem with Gorges, Marines jumping slowing down in air by too much and Lerk movement.

**Change**

* Updated to Steamworks 1.18 SDK.
* Welders won't scale up their repair rates for structures which are under attack.
* Eggs will only spawn in the same location as their Hive (as opposed to another room right next to the Hive in some cases)
* Changed the weapon pickup key to be the same as the weapon drop key, fixes issues like using the Armory and picking up nearby Rifles for example.
* Drifters cost now 2 team resources.
* Cysts cost now 2 personal resources.
* Motion tracking blips in the Marine hud will flash up and slowly disappear instead of constantly being visible.
* Commanders see now the order type of the selected units.
* Increased animation speed of health/armor bars for better feedback.
* Flamethrower damage calculation is now more precise (instead of being a simply cone in view direction)
* Added a Jetpack icon for the Prototype Lab.
* Marine orders are now visible on the minimap.

**Aliens**

* Reduced Skulk ground base speed to 7.2 from 8 (still slightly higher than pre 199)
* Skulks will stick less often unintended to walls.
* Gorge can now belly slide off infestation again and benefits from sliding down ramps.
* Reduced Fade shadow step cooldown to give more freedom since it's anyway controlled through another soft cooldown.
* Added a soft cooldown for shadow step. When you perform a shadow step within 1.7 seconds it's effectiveness is reduced.
* Adjusted Fade camera position and added subtle camera animations.
* Added more air control to Fades.
* Players won't be forced anymore to always blink forward.

**Sound**

* Alien Commander uses now custom sounds for spending resources.
* Added looping flying sound for Lerk.
* Hooked up MAC hover sound.
* Better invalid sound for aliens.
* Larger and more consistent volume falloffs.
* Resnode idle sound.
* Voice overs for ""weld target"" and ""attack target"".
* More epic Command Station destroyed sound.
* Nicer welder scanning sound.

**SDK**

* The reset console command can now be used from the dedicated server without cheats being enabled.
* Added list_players/status server commands to print a list of player info to the console.
* New map entity: sound_effect. This can be used to trigger sounds based on signals being emitted from other entities.
* Fixed hot loading of script files so that it produces more consistent behavior with complex Lua files.
* Fixed issue where the ""isa"" function was not present on objects if their class was recreated.

1. Have a comm who is getting upgrades and res, but not really directing aliens on exactly where to be? EJECT! You need to get in that seat and tell people where to be, but only after you blame everything on the previous commander. Don't even think about directing your teammates from the field, organizing ambushes or calling out info. your job is to complain about upgrades you don't have. 

2. Is the commander pinging rooms where marines are constantly harassing cyst chains, cutting off expansion and res flow? IGNORE IT! You have large groups of marines to run into head first!

3. Did the commander go crag/cara instead of shift/celerity first? EJECT! There's no way you can win without celerity. 

4. Did he place drifters around the map so you can see marine pushes before they happen? Is he pinging and announcing those places ahead of time? IGNORE IT! Drifters are for rookies.

5. Arcs sitting outside of nano? Don't push in as a group and clear them out. Definitely don't organize a main base hit to recall them. Don't go gorge and bile, he got you bile right? No concern, this is the perfect time to take your complaints from annoying to full on demeaning!

6. Is he saving up for tRes fade drops? EJECT! You need to get in there and place shades and make forward bases! 

7. Did the commander get you cara/silence/leap and blink while sitting on 4 res nodes for most of the game, but you still can't clear the phase gate or get any kills? EJECT! you need shifts and celerity!!

Be sure and be vocal about your complaints! Be demeaning and rude. Blame everyone and get upset. This way, you will never feel like you actually contributed to the loss. You did your best! You CARRIED the team, but a bad commander held you down and everyone should know that. It's your right to let them know.

I don't get to play as often as I used to, but every time I do, it's not hard to find a great game. Thanks server operators and community members for making this game welcoming.

1365320662.0,33,self.ns2,1budel,These are the games NS2 is all about.,RyenDeckard,36,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1budel/these_are_the_games_ns2_is_all_about/,"Hey guys, I'm not much of a writer but I just had such a great game I had to share.


The game started with a new commander, we started in Pipeline on Veil, and marines quickly scouted us out and dropped an Armory in the neck. They went fast shotguns and tried to rush
the hive. The commander dropped celerity and we pushed them back, when the commander said he had to leave. I jumped in the chair and told everybody to secure nano and cargo.


Nano was secured with a single gorge, but when we got to cargo we found the marines setting up in Y Junction and pushing into it hard. We got them out of cargo, but they stayed in Y-Junction, where they got a phase gate up. I dropped a shift there quickly, and kept spawning eggs while telling a few others to set up in topographical. The gorges
in cargo put up a clog wall and hydras to hold off the onslaught of marines, while the guys in topo did the same. A few minutes of this go by, while I get upgrades and
save for the hive drop.


As soon as I'm able to drop the hive, I hear they have a robo in Y-Junction and arcs are coming out, as marines continue to swarm Cargo. I drop the hive anyway, having no
other options. As soon as it's dropped it starts getting hit, and goes down quickly afterwards. All I can spend res on now is eggs and shifts, so I get a shift in topo
and start spawning eggs there. Once we destroyed a few arcs and pushed them out of cargo again (still in Y) I get gorge tunnels and my gorges in topo get a tunnel from
pipeline to topo, where we rush their base as they're busy with Y-Junction, still fighting off two gorges and a skulk.

We take Control without any real issues, and I quickly cyst in and drop the hive. They've already set up another base in Subsector though, and they're still pushing cargo.
After taking Control the marine team takes out nanogrid and gets a phase gate in there, but now I've secured Control, Topo, and Skylights so I actually had a net gain with
my res flow. Another shift popped down in Control, and I tell my team to secure Overlook which they do. I get a shift in Overlook and try to drop Cargo again, only for it to be
taken down again. I get a few eggs off in Overlook before the shift is taken out and we're beat back to Skylights, all the while Cargo is under constant assault.

Control goes up quickly thanks to a gorge building it, and I get leap and carapace straight away, and work on any and all upgrades I can while the assault is still going on.
My team retakes overlook and starts pushing into Sub while they're busy with Cargo still.

The only advanced life-form we've had up until this point has been a single Lerk, with multiple gorges (about four or five on a team of 10). That's when one of my guys
goes Onos, while about three skulks, a gorge, and a lerk hit Sub. I tell them to fall back after marines start coming in through the phase gate, and I set up crags in Overlook.

Then somebody else goes Onos in overlook, and then another person goes Fade. This is when we finally push Sub, forcing a beacon which we still fought off, taking out the power.

While this is happening, they finally push into cargo and take control of it, so I drop Sub and tell my team to head to Nanogrid. Once they get to nanogrid the marines finally
conceded.

This was the craziest back and forth game I have ever played, with no clear winner the entire 30+ minute game. It was incredibly intense, and everybody on both teams were fantastic.
Probably the first game of NS2 I have ever played where the only reason we won was because of strategy and not skill.

I will probably start recording my games after this one, I really wish I could put this game up on youtube, it was a hell of a pub.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,,True,t3_1budel,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1budel/these_are_the_games_ns2_is_all_about/,

1374488638.0,31,self.ns2,1isyo8,For new players: How to end a match.,yosemighty_sam,39,8,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1isyo8/for_new_players_how_to_end_a_match/,"Competitive matches last 5-15 minutes. Pubs usually last 10-30. With so many new players thanks to the steam sales 45+ is getting pretty common, ending in turtles that inexperienced players don't know how to break. It can be demoralizing for new players who are eager to learn the flow of the game, but have to wait through slow and bitter ends. So here are some tips for ending a match, so you can get on with the next one. 

Alien Tactics:

1. Gorges. It's real easy. Just bile bomb the power from a doorway, drop clogs for cover and arc your shots over them. 

2. If that doesn't work, send the onos'. But their job is not to kill marines! It's to absorb damage by drawing fire, or prevent damage with stomp. That way the gorges can keep biling. All onos attacks should be against the power.

3. Front line crags/shifts/drifters. As alien commander you have incredible power to turn a fight. No better time than when you're trying to make this the last fight. So, cyst your way as close as you can to the marine base and drop a crag/shift. Enzyme your gorges/onos. Then follow with cysts near the gorges, they will grow fast if they catch the gorges healing themselves, and allow you to use the rest of your command abilities to turn the battle. This is for when the gorge/onos bile bombings can't hold the line long enough to finish the job. 

""But, exos,"" you say. Ah, yes, the caveat. If your attacks on the power are held off by exos, you're going to have to kill the exos first. Just use the same strategy as on the power, but try not to waste onos' on them. A couple dodging skulks and some bile can take out exos easily. Add enzyme and exos melt. 

Marine Tactics:

1. Hold X, mouse down to the ""Concede"" button, and left click. If you're on the losing end of last stand, there's no shame in conceding. It's an honorable acknowledgement that the match has been decided. GG, and vote for the next map. 

2. Recycle the Infantry Portals. If your team is too ashamed to admit defeat, and too unresponsive to concede, you as a commander have the option of recycling the IPs and preventing marines from spawning. When the last man is dead, or the command chair dies, the match ends.

3. Arcs. If you do in fact find yourself unable to break an alien team, break them with arcs. With every shot they damage every building within radius, through walls. But they need line of sight, so use scans in the room you want to obliterate.

edit: more thoughts to add. 

You can't just kill marines during a turtle. Most of the game killing is not for the sake of killing, but forcing marines to respawn and *lose time* returning to the front, giving you time to secure territory. This game is all about territory control. But with a turtle, all the territory is won already, and it's really hard to kill marines faster than they spawn, so you have to fight for time in indirect ways. You have to draw their fire, nerf their attacks, and force them to do anything other than shoot your gorges.

One lerk with spores and umbra has a huge impact. Both spores and umbra block vision, and umbra prevents damage while spores cause damage, but spores also threaten damage. Skilled lerks aren't just trying to kill with spores, they're choosing the negative space to box marines in, forcing them to dodge and scatter into corners, or into one spot where a xeno or two will be devastating.

Fades can vortex armories to stop healing, vortex observatories to allow hallucinations in undetected, and should be the number one marine killer while all fire is focused on the onos'/gorges. Even without vortex, fades are the best equipped to avoid damage while still demanding marines' attention. So do your best to harass and bait, get as many marines as you can to chase you out of base. Act scared and they are more likely to chase. While they chase you out one door, send in the onos/gorges through the other door. 

Skulks can xenocide in pairs to kill packs of marines, or just run cleanup. When I command, I like to tell skulks to attack marines and IPs only, fades to target the gl's/flames, and onos/gorges to kill the power.

* hold ""W+A"" OR ""W+D""
* jump nonstop by very shortly releasing and holding space again **after** each jump (this way you will always jump automatically as soon as you touch the ground)
* to gain speed at the start, get close to a wall while jumping to walljump; when losing speed, wall jump again as necessary

There is no need to switch strafing direction or curving the mouse in a specific direction, because you will lose very little speed while holding a strafe key, and gain speed by wall jumping occasionally.


**Fade:**

Same, but gain speed by shortly right clicking instead of wall jumping. Holding crouch will make you a harder target without losing speed.

**Marine:**

Jump onto stairs and jump again when touching the stairs to gain a speed boost. Also works when walking backwards.

It is the basic foot soldier. It is the lowest common denominator. 

**As an alien player, it is your responsibility to play the Skulk as best as you can in between all your stints as higher lifeforms.**

This is the first part to a Series of Themed Guides.

---

Your Basic Stats:
---
* Health: 70
* Armor: 10    
* Gestation Time: 3 Seconds

Weapons:
---
**Bite** - Melee Strike
    * 75 Damage per Bite
    * 0.75 Second Delay
       
**Parasite** - Ranged Hitscan attack that marks the target to be seen through walls by yourself and other players
    * 10 Damage per Hit
    * 0.5 Second Delay

**Leap** - Hive2 Ability that gives the Skulk a burst of speed. 

**General Abilities**
---

**Alien Vision**- A default alien ability given to all aliens which **will highlight terrain and players despite lighting conditions.
   ** 
    
**Stalk** - Holding the (Shift) key will cause the player to move slowly, stifling any sound made by quicker traveling. Skulk movement is further modified (explained in next bullet)

**Passive Ability:**
---

**Wall-running** - Skulk specific ability that allows the skulk to move along the walls and ceilings. Vision will slightly tilt in accordance with the skulk's position to the floor. **Using the Stalk ability in conjunction will increase grip.**

--- 
How long will it take for you to die?
---

Let's take a look at the Typical Marine Weapon Stats. For the sake of simplicity, I will be omitting upgrades and the flamethrower in this guide.

**Assault Rifle**
    * 10 damage per bullet
    * Fire Delay of 0.0555 seconds
    
With full accuracy, a marine can kill a skulk in ~0.61 seconds.
Given a 50% hit rate due to bullet spread or human error, a skulk will die in ~1.22 seconds.

**Shotgun**
    * 1-20 damage per pellet, depending on range
    * 10 pellet spread per shot
    * Damage potential of up to 200
    * Fire Delay 0.9 seconds 

A skulk will die instantly to a full, point-blank shotgun blast.
At longer ranges, it will take 2-3 shots to kill a skulk, which would be between 1.8 and 2.7 seconds ideally.

**Conclusion:** Marines can kill skulks very quickly given the opportunity. And don't fuck with people carrying shotguns.

---
How long will it take to kill a Marine?
---

**Non-upgraded Marine Stats**

* Health: 100
* Armor: 30

Given 3 bites and ideal delay times, it will take a Skulk 2.25 seconds to kill a Marine.

However, Parasiting a marine will put them at a threshold that allows Skulks to kill them in only two bites, which will reduce the ideal kill-time to 1.5 seconds.

**Conclusion:** Use parasite on Marines to reduce the kill-time.

---
How does Leap Work?
---

*Firstly*, the Leap speed increase does not expire until you make contact with a surface. This means that so long as you are in the air, you will be traveling at increased speed until you hit something. If you don't hit any walls or the ceiling, only gravity will influence your travel time per leap. **So when you are traveling with the leap ability, aim your leaps upward so that you will cross longer distances.** 

*Secondly*, you are able to use the Leap ability in mid-air. This means that **you can change your travel direction in mid-air by leaping in a new direction.**

---
TL;DR
---
* Use Alien Vision in Low-Light Situations
* Holding the Shift button makes it easier to walk on the walls/ceiling
* You are squishy. Don't get in a Marine's line of sight!
* Parasite before you Bite
* Aim upwards when you leap to travel further and longer
* You can leap in mid-air to change direction and velocity

1357146139.0,28,self.ns2,15tzpo,I found something new that I love about NS2... MODS!,nsfade,34,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/15tzpo/i_found_something_new_that_i_love_about_ns2_mods/,"Over the past couple of weeks I've had some more time to play around with the NS2 mods. I'll admit that I wasn't sold on the mods when they were first introduced and thought they were a pain to use. I subscribed for a few and did not realize that I had to enable them in the game menu under ""Mods"". Once I figured out how to subscribe and enable them I was HOOKED. Some mods are a lot of fun like the ""Gunslinger mod"" which puts a cool skin on a lot of the Marine structures (One of my favorite parts of this mod is the shark-like-teeth now on the turrets). But they are not limited to aesthetics! I picked up a ""simple"" cross-hair mod that not only gave me a great new cross-hair, but I also now have a small cross-hair dot for my skulk view which has actually helped me out a lot with precise biting.

Here are some questions I have for the NS2 community:

- What mods do you use and would recommend to others??
- Do you think the mods to change the ""alien vision"" are almost like a hack in a bad way?
- I came across a mod that removed a lot of the ""noise"" in the Exo suit screen so you now have a clear view. Would you consider this fair or foul to have as a mod? Does it not even matter?
- If I download a gameplay mod (such as Combat or Forsaken) and want to play it locally or at a LAN. How do you start a local game with one of these mods without actually starting a server?


Here are some mods I use, I will try and update with the actual mod names later when I'm not at work :-)

**Aesthetic**

- ""Gunslinger Overhaul"" 
- ""e_X_m""   (Marine armor mod)
- ""e_X_m  Hands""
- ""e_X_m Spawn"" 
- ""e_X_w Holo rifle v2.0"" (looks cool and also frees up more of the screen)
- ""e_X_w Flamethrower""
- ""e_X_b  MAC""
- ""e_X_o""  (mod changing the exo's armor)
- ""Red Eclipse Phase Gate""
- ""Infestation Redux"" (This is the mod to make infestation glow!)


**Productivity**

- Any of ""Koruyo's Crosshairs""
- ""Mini-map Colored Players"": this mod makes aliens always red and marines always green on the map while leaving the marines structures the usual blue. This mod has many reasons why it helps me but one obvious one is being able to clearly see your marines as a commander (sometimes I will not see a marine in a room on the map because there are so many other marines structures there)
- ""Simple Waypoints &amp; Scan Circles""
- ""Transparent Map""
- The mod mentioned above that removes the extra onscreen crap from the Exo suit (still can't find the name of it though)

Edit: Another cool mod that I will have to find the exact name for made the alien infestation GLOW!

Edit: As promised, I've updated the list above with the actual names of the mods I'm using.

For those of you who enjoy NS2 and the way the game is currently played, let me remind you of what happened in NS1.

When combat mode (CO) came out, it was right around when the game had been pretty balanced and polished, but NS1 was still in third or fourth place at the time for rated mods, behind DoD and CS.  

I assume to try and attract those CS players (They were like the cod players of the day) CO mode came out.   This would change the strategy of players so that it was more like Counter-strike/DoD, more in regard that players didn't have to worry about one another anymore, and had to worry just about their K:D Ratio to gain experience and buy the next best gun/upgrade.

Anyway once CO mode came out, it was near impossible to find a regular NS_ game any longer.  All the servers for regular NS games now had to be filled by Bots because everyone ran off to CO_ maps and that sort of team base strategy from regular NS mode died off.

Features

    Added ""draw damage"" option to the game. Animates damage you to do to players and structures, showing it on screen even if you're moving around fast and your target quickly leaves your screen. Can be disabled in the options. All predicted on client. Doesn't work for projectiles yet but will shortly.
    Added -config_path command line parameter to the client and the server to change where game configuration files are loaded and saved from.
    Added information to r_stats about how long the CPU waits for the GPU during a frame.
    Added wait for vertical sync and triple buffering options.
    Changed the game to use the speaker configuration that was designated in the Windows control panel.
    Added ""rookie mode"". You are a rookie when you've logged 4 hours or less of play. Rookies show up in green (voice chat, text chat, scoreboard) for their team mates, prompting others to help them. Servers can indicate if they are friendly to new players or not (server ops, docs are here)
    Player resources are now saved when a player disconnects and reconnects to a server.

    Marine weapons and armor research costs reduced from 20/30/40 to 10/20/30. Weapons/Armor1 time increased by 20 seconds, Weapons/Armor2 increased by 10 seconds (reducing increased res. usage of marine economy and promoting dual Arms Labs).
    Regeneration combat delay reduced from 8 seconds to 5 (want to see more regen).
    Skulk bite range reduced by 20% (skulk domination, this is much closer to NS1).
    Slowdown with Carapace removed (drawbacks are implicit in choices, not within traits themselves).
    Tightened Lerk spike accuracy (supposed to be in 219).

Changes

    Adjusted walljump vertical speed to be closer to b216.

I would love to be able to show you a timeline, but apparently NS2stats wasn't set up, probably due to the recent update.

 It was a great reminder why i am still playing *Natural Selection*. Ten years later!!

 My point being: This kind of game does not happen if people always think they know how a round will end. Team morale is one of the most important things in NS2. **Decide to NOT concede from time to time or you will miss out on the best parts of NS2!**

1333884259.0,25,self.ns2,rz4as,To new players: a list of what NOT to do,KaptajnKLO,28,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/rz4as/to_new_players_a_list_of_what_not_to_do/,"I have played this beta for a few weeks now and one thing that absolutely frustrates me to no end as of late is when I get on a server and there are a lot of new players who don't know how to play this game at all and who most importantly *just won't listen*. I don't pretend to be great at the game, but I know the basics since I bothered to learn about the game before I bought it and I have been watching a lot of videos from some of the better players. So I thought I would make this post so we can create a list for new players of what NOT to do. Here we go:


- Do not disregard orders. If the commander says to go to ""X"" location, you need to go to ""X"" location! This is really really important! An example could be if the marine commander scans ""X"" location and sees the aliens are building a hive and he wants the team to take it out, then you need to follow that order! Not doing so will result in the aliens securing that area and thus the hive becomes that much harder to kill.

- Don't go out on your own, you are not Rambo! You need to stay with your team in groups of 2 or 3 to be most effective. Unless you have a purpose like sniping an enemy resourse tower (RT) or scouting you are not helping your team by solo'ing.

- Do not stand still, you need to be active at all times. Lying in wait to surprise an enemy that might or might not come for minutes is a waste of time and does not help your team. And staying in base will only give the enemy team plenty of time to secure the whole map.

- One of the most important things in this game is resourses. The amount of RTs that your team holds determines how much personal res you have to spend on weapons, upgrades and higher life forms. You need to be securing RTs for your team or destroying enemy RTs at all times throughout the game unless the commander tells you otherwise! This is crucial for the success of your team and not doing so will just give map control over to the enemy!

- As an alien you should prioritize RTs and other buildings over powernodes. A powernode can be built so fast and doesn't cost anything that it is a complete waste of time to destroy it in most circumstances. It is also a small structure, so a skulk is very exposed if he goes for a powernode since he can't hide behind it and as a result the marines can easily kill him. The only powernode that is worthwhile to go for as a primary target is the one in their main base.

- Information is vital in this game and you should not withhold it. Especially if you're commanding! If you see e.g. 3 marines in ""X"" location setting up a phase gate you need to relay that information, so your team can respond. Or if you see 4 skulks incoming to your base your team needs to know that. Also as a skulk you should get into the habit of parasiting EVERYTHING! Not only can you see parasited marines or structures through walls but your alien teammates can aswell!

- Do not ""overbuild"" in unsecured areas unless you are certain that you are safe. What I mean by that is that there shouldn't be 3 marines building an RT, as the aliens can easily sneak up on you and get the edge in the fight. Someone always needs to be standing guard while others build, as that split second from when the marine on guard spots a skulk or 2 from the distance can be the difference between a bunch of dead marines and a bunch of live marines.

- If you are new to commanding and don't know what you are doing then do not ignore what your team wants you to build. If someone says to build a second infantry portal (IP) in the beginning it's so you can survive a skulk rush and you should do it. If your team wants mines you should not ignore that request. Also if you don't have a mic... DON'T COMMAND! Seriously, a mic is really important for the commander to have, as sometimes you only have mere seconds to warn your team of e.g. a skulk ambush. And relaying information is much easier with a mic.

- Mines are great at denying harassment by skulks at extractors and for shutting down vents, but it's a waste if you clump too many of them together in one area as a single skulk can set them all off or a fade can just blink over them and set them all off aswell. They are more effective if you spread them out so they are just out of the blast radius of other mines. Also don't just put mines on the ground in easily spotted areas, but strategically place them at spots where they will surprise the aliens. You can place them on the walls, in some places you can jump and place them on the ceiling, place them at vents or just infront of a door. 

- You need to glance at your map (C by default) and do it often. For one you need to familiarize yourself with the maps, so you instantly know where to go if the commander wants you or the team somewhere specific on the map. But it is also to have a constant understanding of what's going on around the map. For instance if you're on the alien team then simply by looking at the map often you can spot marines when they are on the creep well before they can do any damage and you have time to respond and alert your teammates.

- As a marine don't stand right next to your other marine teammates. Give each other a little distance. It's much easier to shoot a skulk jumping around a teammate than around you! Bunched up marines also waste a lot of ammo accidentally shooting each other instead of the aliens as they don't have a clean line of fire. 

I can't think of anymore things to add atm, so if anyone has suggestions for this list you are welcome to post them below. ",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,True,,onos,True,t3_rz4as,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/rz4as/to_new_players_a_list_of_what_not_to_do/,

It´s my experience after 90 hours of play, that the offensive teams wins almost everytime (pub games). I see this a lot in pub games - people not being offensive enough, but using all their resources trying to defend. 

Big attack needs to be organized, but a good idea is always have a little group being offensive, even if your own base is being attacked. 

Counter attacks can actually be used to defend your own base, here´s an example:

Marines have a PG outside one of the aliens hives. All the marines are trying to get the hive down, and all the alien is trying to defend. Well, marines can get back to their main base fast i know that, but if a Ono attack the power in main, you can be lucky that they beacon - giving the rest of the team time to get the PG down.

What do you guys think?

If you didn't get a chance to sign up but still want to play please send me a message an inform me you would like to be a stand in, last tournament we had a fair number of no shows so there is always a chance you may still be able to play!

**About:** (Thanks to Rubix in advanced, I stole a lot of this layout from you)

After running the first tournament we really wanted to get bring some competitive action back to our reddit community so [C.H.U.D] (Liverpoop) and I (Old_Greg) have decided to organize a small in-house tournament for the reddit community before we open it up to the whole of the NS2 community.

**Event Info**

* This tournament will be played on [2nd of December (Sunday)](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20121202T18&amp;p0=263&amp;msg=Reddit+In-house+Natural+Selection+2+Tournament)

* This tournament will take place in the NA servers, although we aren't barring EU or Oceania players from this tournament you will have to deal with the higher latency from NA servers. Sorry for the inconvenience guys.

* Individuals who signup will be placed randomly on teams based on skill level in an attempt to create balanced teams, there will be no group or team signups for this tournament

* Due to our limited servers and not wanting to go over 7 hours again like the last tournament, we are limiting this to 12 teams, first come first serve!

* You will be given 5 minute breaks inbetween rounds to go to the bathroom, grab drinks, whatever you need. But we will not be having 30 minute long breaks inbetween rounds.

* We will be using all of the NS2 maps except for Refinery (Consult www.ns2stats.org as to why)

* The bracket will be single elimination with every match being a Bo3.
Any single match that lasts longer than 30 minutes can be stopped by a referee if they feel one team has an insurmountable lead.

* The event starts at 6:00 PM EST ([Timer](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20121202T18&amp;p0=263&amp;msg=Reddit+In-house+Natural+Selection+2+Tournament)), but try to be online either on Steam and mumble at 5:30 PM

**Signups**

* To sign up, send me a message through reddit by Friday at midnight (EST) with the following format:
 * **Username, Skill Level, Commander/FPS**
 * Skill levels are as follows:
  * Rookie: I just bought this game is it fun?
  * Average: I've played some pubs and have a basic understanding of the game.
  * Veteran: Do you even lift?!? I eat 6v6's for breakfast!
* We're limited on the number of teams by the number of commanders who sign up. So if you're willing and able to command but would rather just be a soldier, mark yourself down as FPS(can command) and we'll only put you in charge of a team if necessary.




**Organizers**

* [Old_Greg](http://steamcommunity.com/id/solereavr/) (SourceIamA)

* [[C.H.U.D.]](http://steamcommunity.com/id/liverpoop/) (Liverpoop)

**Servers**

* **If you have a server and would like to donate it for the duration of the tournament that would be much appreciated**

* Reddit.com/r/ns2
 * redditns2.com
* Funhouse (Thanks Rapey)
 * funhouse.ns2servers.com
* Lectr's Server
 * lectr.ns2servers.com

Note: to connect to an server manually open the console with the tilde key and type ""connect &lt;ip address&gt; &lt;password&gt;""

**Chat** (If this can't be used I'll find a replacement and update the thread)

* c4sh 'lft's Mumble Server
 * 74.86.55.132
 * Port: 64738
 * Join the ""Natural Selection 2"" channel when the event starts
 * Each team will have their own password protected channel
 * To join your channel go to Server&gt;Access Tokens&gt;Then add your commander's name in all lower-case
 * Do not attempt to enter another team's channel and do not give out your password to other teams
 * Be respectful of c4sh's wishes as he was nice enough to let us use his server
 * Download mumble [here](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/)

**Match Protocol** (Thanks Rubix, I stole this from you &lt;3)

* Old_Greg (SourceIamA on reddit) will message each commander through Steam with the server they are assigned to.
* Each team's assigned server will also be added to the bottom of this post.
* Do not join a server if your team is not assigned to it!
* In Game
 * Both teams will join the server and stay in the ready room
Once both teams are on the server, each team's commander will type a number between 1-100 into chat (excluding 50 because come on, that's a wussy number).
 * The team that guesses closer to the referee's number will choose their starting race and map.
 * The referee will switch the server to the correct map.
 * Both teams will enter the game as their respective races.
 * When both commanders have typed ""Ready"" in chat, the referee will use the sv_reset command to officially start the match.
 * After that the loser of each round will choose the next map and the teams will switch races.
 * Note: You can choose to play the same map, however you cannot play the same map twice as the same race.
 * When a team has won two matches the referee will message me with the score and both teams will leave the server.
 * New Rule: Temper tantrums, rage fits, offensive language, etc, is prohibited and a referee has the power to remove any player from the tournament if they break this rule. Smack talk is allowed if its in good competitive nature. Don't ask me to explain the difference, we are all mature enough to understand that saying ""How'd I get to be so good?"" is different from saying ""You're a (Insert offensive word here).""

**Dropouts and No-shows**

* If you are missing somebody from your team and have not heard from them by the time the tournament starts message Old_Greg on steam and I will get a replacement player for you.

* If you find that you cannot make it to the tournament for whatever reason message SourceIamA on Reddit ASAP (Or Old_Greg on steam).

* **Notes**
 * If you have any questions or comments please feel free to message me on reddit or on steam.

Just want to let you guys know there's a bad egg in the bunch of lovely NS2 servers on the master list.  If you guys come across this server:

**Victurus Online Gaming Guild - NS2 - Dallas** (IP Address: 74.63.253.115) and see an Admin named [Ecks (some clan tag in front)](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970721896), beware.

My story: I was marine commander, doing alright, holding 3 bases - suddenly I noticed a Gorge in our base bile bombing, but none of our marines can hit him because he was apparently in between walls (a known exploit).  Aliens team called him out as well, and we recognize he was one of the admins.  So we said we will report him - suddenly I was switched from Marine Commander to Aliens.  And guess who I see in Marine's comm chair? Ecks.  I told my old teammates how to eject him seeing as he's either trolling our team or taking over by admin abuse.  He got ejected shortly, and I told my team to hang tight as I won't be able to rejoin them (team unbalanced).  After that, guess what? I got kicked and banned.  Obvious, really.

Anyways, if you guys come across this server, just be prepared for some un-pleasantry.  You can choose to believe me or not, just a heads up.

I won't go into the nature of the exploit, but apparently it's a well known exploit in a particular map.

Anyways, cheers and have fun guys! I joined the reddit server shortly there after and had loads of fun to make up for the abuse.  Good times!

Edit: Just want to clarify - I'm not seeking any action against the guy nor reporting him to an authority.  It's simply a PSA for /r/ns2/.

Everytime I do or when I'm playing under another commander who does I hear tons of people hate on them saying that you should NEVER build them. Some people defend them but I almost always hear people hating on them more than being happy they are there.

You will only be able to change the grid of the hotkeys, not hotkeys for specific abilities/actions.

How To Change The Grid Hotkeys
--
1. Navigate to your Steam folder
2. Open the UserData folder
3. You will see one or multiple folders with numbers, these are Steam account IDs.
4. When you have a look into these you will, again, see folders with numbers. Those numbers represent the game ID. The ID for Natural Selection 2 is 4920. You will now have to search for the correct account ID with the folder ""4920"" in it.
5. After you found this, you should go to the folder ""Steam\UserData\\[your account ID]\4920\remote""
6. Open options.xml with your favorite text editor

This file stores your settings. They consist of so-called ""tags"", for example &lt;tag&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;. You will now have to change the content of some of these tags. Use ctrl+f to search for the tags you have to change.

For QWERTZ keyboards
---
1. change &lt;Z&gt;Z&lt;/Z&gt; to &lt;Z&gt;Y&lt;/Z&gt;
2. change &lt;Y&gt;Y&lt;/Y&gt; to &lt;Y&gt;Z&lt;/Y&gt;

For AZERTY keyboards
---
1. change &lt;Q&gt;Q&lt;/Q&gt; to &lt;Q&gt;A&lt;/Q&gt;
2. change &lt;A&gt;A&lt;/A&gt; to &lt;A&gt;Q&lt;/A&gt;
3. change &lt;W&gt;W&lt;/W&gt; to &lt;W&gt;Z&lt;/W&gt;
4. change &lt;Z&gt;Z&lt;/Z&gt; to &lt;Z&gt;W&lt;/Z&gt;

The different grids
---

  **QWERTY**`          `**QWERTZ**`           `**AZERTY**

    Q W E R t y        Q W E R t z        A Z E R t y
    A S D F g h        A S D F g h        Q S D F g h
    Z X C V b n        Y X C V b n        W X C V b n

You should have the basic idea on how to customize the grid now. For example, if you want to change the grid one to the right (who knows why) you just change &lt;Q&gt;Q&lt;/Q&gt; to &lt;Q&gt;W&lt;/Q&gt;, &lt;W&gt;W&lt;/W&gt; to &lt;W&gt;E&lt;/W&gt; etc.

It takes place during this past King of the Web election (9/1-9/15) if you don't know what it is, it's basically a thing popular (sometimes not so popular) individuals run in to win a grand prize of money. Anyway my good buddy TheCompletionist ran and livestreamed almost the entire two weeks, myself included to keep people entertained while he had to go do other things. During the whole process we were raffling off games for his fanbase including the big names such as Borderlands 2, Dark Souls, etc. Then I came up with the idea to get some NS2 copies while on stream. Naturally the chat (about 300 people at the time) filled up with questions about what the game was so I showed them the steam trailer. The days that followed always had discussions about NS2 and how much fun it looked. Many agreed that this was a far more interesting game than any of the AAA titles that were coming out. Unfortunately, during the course of the election we were only able to give out 3 copies. But that didn't stop the fans from going out and pre-ordering the game themselves! We have some game events planned with NS2 and are super excited to get our hands on this game! Just a little story I thought I'd share with some fellow redditors that are also excited for this. :)

TL;DR Friend ran for KotW, gave many games away to fanbase for it. NS2 was more popular than AAA titles with the fanbase and they're super excited for it.

Freeing up some of the micromanagement to squad leaders can let the commander concentrate on other things and keep the team split into cohesive units.

All it does is search the server's name for the tag ""RS:NN"" where NN is the number of reserved slots. So if your server is named ""King Kahuna Hive 5 RS:02"" and is reporting 20/22 players, this mod will show the server as having 20/20 players (full). You can still try to connect if you have a slot reserved for you and if ""Hide Full"" is checked the server is properly hidden in the browser list.

This mod currently does nothing because there aren't any servers with the ""RS:"" tag in their name. So I need 2 things from the community:

* 1) Server admins: can you please use the RS:NN tag to list the number of reserved slots on your server!
* 2) Server admins: are you okay with the RS:NN tag? Would you rather it be something else like ""#RS"" or ""(NN Reserved Slots)""

If an onos stumbles upon 3-4 marines he will have no problem killing or retreating from them. An onos is much more forgiving of error given its extreme health, speed, and AoE stun. That's not even mentioning their capacity to regen, stealth, be completely silent, etc.

Meanwhile the 2x minigun Exo feel like crap in comparison. It's utterly dependent on multiple teammates to keep you repaired and unswarmed. If you make even a slight mistake, your low health and pathetic speed ensure you will die. Your inability to move quickly, phase, or be recalled ensures that against a smart alien team you will never be in the right place to make a difference. Unlike onos, I have never seen a dual-exo pilot turn the tide of a game. In chaotic multi-onos/multi-exo fights that decide games I have never, ever seen the exosuits win. The exosuits are forced to stay clumped for safety since the highly maneuverable onos will gladly pick off any solo exo's... but when they stay clumped they give the aliens a free pass to strike elsewhere on the map and when the big fight ultimately comes the Exos are often firing into each other's backs and have no way of determining which Onos to focus fire. Then bilebombs fall in and its hopeless for the exos with bile covering 80% of their screen and they are all being 3-shot. 

That doesn't even get into the issue of marines being extremely vulnerable to a surgical strike on their power/arms lab and having their exo's go from glass cannon to ""paper mache noodle"" and get shredded in seconds. 

I don't follow the competitive scene and I'm sure a well organized team of professional players have a difference kind of balance, but in public games I have absolutely no doubt that the Onos are far stronger than the Exosuits. Right now the ""pub game"" meta is to make sure you cripple aliens before they get Onos, or pray a rookie grabs the Onos egg, because even if the marines have more resources at 20 minutes - multiple intelligent Onos are almost impossible to counter.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,,True,t3_13eulw,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/13eulw/pound_for_pound_why_is_the_dualminigun_exo_so/,

Marine movement speed, for example, seems slower but at the same time skulks leap doesn't seem to make them go half way across the map like you could in the first one.

I've made some major changes to the ARS mod, you can click over to the Steam Workshop page to see how it works now.

This mod has been out for over a little over a week and only has 1 group of servers using the RS# tag (thanks TacticalGamer.com!). I suspect a large part of the problem is reaching server administrators. While there are many NS2 forums and even an NS2 server admin mailing list, it's still difficult to engage server admins. When I decided to make these changes I was going to wait longer to see if things would catch on, but I really don't see a reason to wait.

Instead of giving up on this mod, I've taken it a step further with some major changes. The mod now has an internal database of servers and their reserved slots. It still checks every server name for an RS# tag, but if none is found it relies on the internal DB.

This allows the mod to identify *many* more servers with reserved slots at a small cost: I have to personally maintain the database and between updates a server's database entry may become outdated. Most servers don't change their name or the number of reserved slots very often, so it shouldn't be too large of a problem.

It would be extremely helpful to me if you could report servers that are inaccurately id'ed by the mod. For example, if you try to connect to a server that's marked as not having any reserved slots and are kicked to make room for reserved slot users, just post a message here. Make sure you include the full server name so I can look into it.

You can also help by encouraging server admins to put the number of public slots (the number of players that can connect before the server kicks them to make sure players with a reserved slot can connect) in their motd and by encouraging admins to use the RS# tag.

I played NS1 and it was the same thing. I've been playing shooters for a decade now, and I'm not uberleet or anything but I can always put up a great fight. I also haven't ragequit any game since CS1.6. I've ragequit NS three times this week.

My main frustration is, as skulk I feel like I *can not* get the bites in to kill a marine before they spray their LMG for what seems like the blink of an eye and don't waste a single round. So I think, Marine is OP right? Not when trusted to my goofy cartoon hands. I empty an entire LMG clip into a skulk coming straight at me, and no kill.

**WHAT** am I doing wrong??

EDIT:
Thank you all for the input. Things I've learned so far, from here or otherwise:
    1. I'm trained to shoot at a moving human who has a gun. Skulks move very differently from that, whether they know it or not.
    2. Bite accuracy is key. It's not hit-or-miss like I thought, so not all bites do full damage. Aiming for a player's center does most damage.
    3. 1 parasite + 2 perfect bites = kill
    4. Running circles around feet isn't a nooby thing to do, it's a real skill and strategy.
    5. Wall jumping is a thing, but it's only for the uberleet

I'm writing this because in 99,9% of all the public games I play, people insist on opening with phasegate tech, and next they build a phasegate at every single tech point, and believe then that they have ""map control"".
I'm here to tell you guys why this is a bad way to open as a marine commander.
You can skip this introduction if you want, but I just want to say, when ever I don't do this opening, I get flamed endlessly by my team mates during the match, which obviously lowers morale, and I get zero credit when we win and all the blame if we lose.
I never get a real chance to defend my opening, partly because I'm not very skilled at conceptualising these ideas in english in real-time, and partly because there's little time to actually explain it to the players.

Here's the problem with phase tech. You first need an observatory (15 res), then phase tech (15 res) then 2x phase gates (30 res) and then you absolutely need a 2nd Ip (20 res), which in total is 80 res.
80 res is the bare minimum you need to just get one phase gate connection. And this is assuming you're not going to lose any phase gates, so imagine how much res it really costs you to connect every tech point. And I'm going to be fair and not count mines with that, although you need that too. But remember, this 80 res figure, is assuming you're not losing and need to replace any phase gates!

But here's the main issue. Those 80 res, are ALL going towards defense. A good comparison would be a protoss in starcraft who forge fast expands, and then builds 5 canons at his natural. It is 80 res, which NON of it is spent towards pressuring the aliens.
And if you've seen or played competetive ns2, you should know that an alien team with 3+ harvesters is absolutely fine.

So here's the thing, if you insist on opening with phase gates, you have to place it in a strategic place where the intention is NOT to defend, but to make an assault. Because for that 80 res to have been anywhere near usefull, you absolutely have to cripple the aliens. You should really at least kill a hive with such a commitment.

So guys, next time you play marine, think about what your purpose is for phase tech. Because it CAN be really strong, if you use it correctly. Just don't use phase gates as defense, it's probably one of the weakest strategies in the game.
More often than not, you're better off just opening with arms lab first.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,1367275762.0,,skulk,True,t3_1dd8b4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1dd8b4/phasegate_opening_critique/,

It costs a fair bit to go lerk, and since I'm not so good with them I end up dying or not doing much. The same goes with entire teams practicing a certain attack.

This would have quite a bit of significance on a pro level. You could set up a late game scenario and practice it over and over. The idea came from starcraft where there are lots of micro and macro practice maps to hone your skills, NS2 needs that. Pro teams who want to practice an attack on particular maps could set it up and try again over and over.

[repost],flyinggorila,25,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1hdr53/tips_for_beginners_repost/,"I posted this the other night as a comment to someone else's thread which has already gotten buried pretty far so I figured I would repost so more people may see it!  Feel free to comment/make corrections, I am by no means perfect at this game.  

glad to see this here! having a hard time finding a game there are so many full servers. makes me SO HAPPY :-)

tips for new players:

1. ask questions! it can be really frustrating to spend forever trying to figure one simple thing out. no one is going to judge! especially this weekend. plus its better for the whole team if you are on the same page, so its in everyone's interest to help you!

2. check the map religiously. downloading a mod like this one helps a lot: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118155096 because it helps highlight players and buildings. when you first start the maps are confusing as all hell, and all I can say is it takes some time, and get used to your minimap key because you are going to be holding it for like half the game.

3. don't shoot the cysts. like seriously. it gives away your position, and lets them know you are coming. they are cheap as hell, and unless you are doing it for one of the following reasons, you are wasting your ammo and your time, which will quickly come to an end as an alien comes and chomps on your stupid butt. ok so reasons: 

a. you are trying to cut off buildings to make them die, especially harvesters (ex. on veil, nanogrid can be cut off and the harvesters will eventually die)

b. you are trying to clear a room because you just took it, and want to build things. to be clear, this is after everything in the room that can kill you is dead. 

c. to deny the aliens being able to build something, like a harvester (pro tip - wait for the to drop the harvester, and then kill it right after!) 

d. you are mainly just defending a base, are within easy range of a armory and a phase gate, and sniping them isn't putting yourself at risk. then sure, go ahead :-P

4. marines - THE GOLDEN RULE: USE THE BUDDY SYSTEM. if you don't, you are only hurting yourself. remember that skulks are melee, and you are ranged. space yourselves around rooms far enough that you can shoot the skulks off each others feet. it is much more effective than standing right next to each other. being bait sucks, but it also is a good wait to spring traps prematurely and letting your squad clean everything up.

5. aliens - don't let the marines dictate the game. it is really tempting to challenge the marines setting up adjacent to your base directly, especially as a new player. THIS IS A MISTAKE. aliens strength comes from their speed and agility. marines are much stronger in groups, and the key is to thin them out. if you are a skulk, slip through and find an rt in the back, AWAY from the front lines. make them come and kill you. run away and hide when you hear them coming. make their lives miserable. the more thinned out you can make them, the better!

6. know what to chomp/shoot at! first off, if you shooting at a cyst, remove your head from your rectum and see number 3 above. second, shoot things that are worth resources. i'll give you a hint, this is USUALLY NOT THE POWER. yes it looks delicious, but rebuilding it is free. only go for the power if it has some tactical advantage like disabling a bunch of buildings, or you want to make sure they can't drop any buildings there quickly. the most common structure you will find opportunities to kill will be rt's/harvesters. these are good. cysts/power bad, rt/harvester good. if you have friends with you, don't attack till they get in position to do so as well. avoid giving yourselves away until you are ready. third, either kill defensive structures, or run past them to safety before attacking other things. hydras and sentries might not seem very dangerous, but they can kill you pretty quick (a quick note, if the hydras are being healed by a gorge, chase down the gorge first, and tell your team to too. hyrdas die much faster without their gorge.

7. If you find yourself in the opposing teams base, it can be hard to know what to attack with so many goodies in front of you. let me give you some tips:
a. marines: go for the upgrades. always always the upgrades. these are shells, spurs, or veils. theses are expensive and it cripples the aliens until they rebuild them. otherwise, shoot gorge tunnels, crags, shifts, or shades. shooting the hive is tempting, but it has a lot of health and you have limited ammo/dps. chances are you won't be able to do it unless you have 4+ teammates with you, and ambush it together.
b. aliens: go for the observatory. even a couple skulks can force a comm to beacon if their obs is about to go down. if not the obs, phase gates are also good. after that i would suggest ip's, proto labs, and arms labs, whatever you can get your jaws on :-) also, it is key to focus fire on things. call out targets for the team if no one else is (even for aliens) as it is much better to kill one thing, than slightly damage five things.

8. pick a role and stick with it. the game will eventually settle into a sort of rhythm, and its important to have people doing everything that needs to get done. if you notice something needs to be done that isn't, do it yourself. your role can change as the game goes on, but its usually good if people stay relatively consistent. some may be less glamours than others, but they are all EXTREMELY important. you will realize how much so when someone doesn't do one, and you lose. this list is by no means all inclusive, however. examples:

a. marines - base defense: its usually good to have at least a couple people at each tech point. once phase gates are up two or three people can bounce around between the gates, but it keeps the rest of the team from having to run back to a phase gate every time a base starts getting harassed. it also gives quicker response times to big pushes, allowing for reinforcements are the comm to beacon.

b. rt capper/defender: aliens are good at harassing rt's, and someone needs to respond when they start to get attacked. its good for people nearby to respond when they can, but for out of the way ones it is good to have someone dedicated to respond to them and recap them if they go down. i've seen marines lose because they lost all their rt's and had no idea because no one paid attention.

c. welder: this used to only be important once exo's came out, but in build 250 welding is now the ONLY way to get back your armor. you should almost always buy a welder when you spawn, and should always weld your teammates when you aren't in combat. that aside, in larger groups of marines having a dedicated welder is actually useful. constantly welding your teammates keeps them alive (even in a fight), and the welder can actually help kill skulks (or onos if you are a badass :-))

d. aliens- the roles for aliens are less fluid due to the fact the lifeforms themselves have their roles, but one crucial one is the rt harasser. these are key to any alien game, and if you don't do it you WILL get boxed in, and you WILL lose (unless you have ridiculously good people). find an rt between tech points, and munch it. when that's dead, do it again. wait just long enough for them to rebuild it and then munch it again. the more you can do it, the better.

9. my final one (for now, want to play instead of keep typing lol) is know whether you need to live or if its ok to die. obviously its never a good thing to die, but sometimes survival isn't as important as some other objective. examples: if you are the last marine alive in your base, and are waiting for reinforcements to hoof it to your location because the phase when down, your goal is to stay alive as long as possible. period. killing things is great, but if you can run instead and stay alive long, that is better. you being alive focuses the aliens on you, and keeps them from killing your structures. every second you can buy helps. on the other end of the spectrum, however, is when you are very disposable. this is when you are chasing down higher lifeforms (seriously, don't think, run that onos down. and that gorge behind its stupid wall, take him down not his stupid green poop balls. those things are free) or when you are a skulk at an onos/fade/lerk party. charge in and try to take down structures within the base while the higher lifeforms engage the marines directly. you might be a sitting duck and get killed quickly, but that takes their attention off the onos that is ramming them in the pooper. just try and think about how you can best be used in the fight.

phew ok I need to stop. but I really hope this helps at least one person out there! remember, ask questions! whether in the game, here on reddit, in the steam forums, wherever. ns2 is a complex game, and the quicker you learn the more fun you will have!",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,,True,t3_1hdr53,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1hdr53/tips_for_beginners_repost/,

However, I've spent the vast majority of that time playing Kharaa. While Marines are fun, I was a bit burnt out on FPS when I started playing NS2 and thus gravitated towards the novel playstyle of the aliens.

However, as of late I've decided to fix my bugger-blasting deficiency by randoming every game. At first it was rough... but then I stumbled across a piece of advice that instantly helped me:

When in direct combat with any alien life form, never back up! To dodge, strafe and/or jump. You move much faster whilst strafing than you do walking backwards, and you can swivel around skulks, potentially throwing them off. While I know that this is incredibly simple advice, I'd never really thought about it until spectating others, and it's already made a huge impact in my effectiveness as a Frontiersman.

Some of you might know me from reddit servers. Because we have got quite a lot of Rookies, who are interrested in commanding I though i should share some of my commanding experience i gathered in this over 9000 games I played comm. I will try to give new players an idea of comanding aliens, and explain possibilities and their advantages/disadvantages. If you disagree on some points feel free to correct me. Also I apologize if I fucked up grammar somewhere, I am not a native speaker.  





**Aliens**  
  
  
  
  
  
As allen Khammander your first job is basically to Cyst the map and get as many harvesters up as possible (4 are enough). But that doesnt mean you should just recklessly throw a harvester on every res node you can find. Alien harvesters take alot of time to grow, so if you lose 2 harvesters before they can earn a single res it will cost you alot of time to get this ressources back. Wait for your Skulks to scout rooms, so you will have an idea where the Marines are. Put Harvesters on spots that seem safest. Dont ever put a harvester infront of a marinebase(earlygame), it will be taken down almost certainly.  






After you got your team some ressource towers its time to think about the first hive upgrade. You have got 3 choices: crags, shifts and shades.  





**-Shifthive:** In my opinion the best and safest choice for first hive in nearly all situations. Celerity will grant your skulks a great movement boost and allow them to be everywhere. Adrenaline isnt needed early game, but gets really important for higher lifeforms. Shifts are also quite awesome. You can spawn eggs everywhere you want. I often use them on central positions like crossroads in summit or nanogrid in veil, so your mates spawn in the middle of the map. Also shifts grant surrounding aliens awesome energy regeneration. So place a shift near growing hives if a gorge is growing them, he will be able to spam his healspray without hesitation, and finish your hive even faster.  



**-Shadehive:** In my opinion not a really good tech. I know many people love them, because its easy to dominate poor marine players, but still I would only rush a shadehive if I am certain that my skulks arent good players and wont be able to kill a single marine with celerity. Camoflage is quite strong and annoying but it has got strong disadvantages. First of all you will be only able to dominate a game with camoflage against really bad marines. Good marines will move in groups, so camoflage wont make a big difference. Also camo will actually encourage bad marines to run in groups because theyre to afraid to walk alone, so you are teaching your enemy to play properly. Your skulks will die less, but move very slow and alien earlygame is all about harrassing extractors, killing marines and beeing everywhere. It doesnt really matter if skulks die more if they can pressure marines really hard. Also camo is only strong early game. So if you dont get 3 hives easily you are in trouble, because camo doesnt really help in mid/lategame. Silence if quite a good tech for bilebomb gorges, but wont help you in the beginning more then camo. Shades are pretty much useless in early game. You have nothing important to hide except of your upgrades, because you cant afford whips, so its not even nearly as good as Shifts or Crags in the early stage of game.  



**Craghive:** The Craghive is an awesome one, but it doesnt make much sense to get it first. Craghive grants 2 upgrades Carapace (Armor) and Regeneration. Both are really important upgrades, especially carapace is important on higher lifeforms like Fades and Onos. But carapace wont do that much differnce for skulks. With carapace Skulks will be able to take a couple more bullets. Its not bad, but not as usefull as camo or celerity. There are situations where fast carapace makes sense, such as close position games, but it is very situational. Would not recomment a beginner to go for it. Crags are for aliens pretty much what armories are for Marines. They heal your Aliens and help to hold positions. Also you can put some Crags near growing hives to substitute a gorge. Ofc a gorge is better, because he is increasing the growing speed, but a Crag can atleast heal the hive up, so it wont be as vulnerable.  



After you decided and built your upgrade its time to safe ressources for second hive and get some more harvesters up. Like in the beginning you choose the safest place possible. Hives are pretty vulnerable when you build them. Here you should communicate with your team and tell them where you want to put your hive up. That help you evade situations like 1 marine taking it down while your team is attacking an extractor at the other side of the map. Losing a Hive worth 40 res is real trouble for your team and might lose you the game. Second hive upgrade is everytime a craghive, due to crags and carapace. If you went craghive first go for shift hive, because camo isnt that much of a deal anymore compared to other upgrades.  



Also there is a possibility to get a fast third hive. If you see your team obliderating the marines and  you got a second safe position for a hive go for it! However this move might delay the upgrades for your team(it will almost certainly unless you have got mass ressources aswell), so you should be really sure you wont lose one of the growing hives.Still, if you can do it, go for it. 3 Hives mean pretty much a won game, because you can drop Onos eggs.  



With the second hive you can research 4 more upgrades: leap, bilebomb, blink and spores. You have to research them all, so the question in what order? This depends pretty much on your team. Watch what most of your teammates are playing. You have got 6 skulks? Go for leap first. You have got 3 lerks and 0 fades? Spores and blink later! Always try to research the upgrade your team benefit most from. In most cases leap and everything after makes sense.  



Your priority after a finished second hive is to get a third hive. Third hive grants the strongest abilities for Lerks, Fades and Onos. Also it gives you the possibility to drop onos eggs as said before.  



If your team cant conquer a third hive try to secure as many ressource points as you can. Mass ressources are often even more important as a third hive, because your teammates can buy onos with pres aswell. With onos you can conquer a third hive position with ease. So take as many ressource points as you can and secure them with whips and crags. Give your temmates fade and lerk eggs, and order them to safe pres for onos. This works in many cases.  



*Well i think i mentioned the most important points, everything else depends on situation. There are still several strategies and other stuff i didnt mention yet:*



**-Whip rush:** If you cant break a marine turtle, this tactic quite nice. You grow 10-20 whips near the base. Then you let them all walk into the enemy base together with your team and focus on spamming cysts all over the place and rooting them. Even if Marines manage to prevent you from getting enough infestation, you still end up breaking the turtle, because marines are wasting their time on destroying your cysts and whips and your team has enough time to destroy enemy power node. Use nutrient mist on cysts so they will spread infestation faster.



**-Cystspam:** If marines are trying to conquer a point, you can spam cysts to prevent them from building structures to give your team more time to push them back.  



**-Drifters:** Everyone forgets about them, but Drifters are super important. You should get drifters really early (after first upgrade) and place them everywhere marines need to pass to reach important points. That will prevent unpleasant surprises like 5 marines suddenly appearing infront of your hive, or ninja marines sniping your upgrades. Also enzyme cloud if quite nice to support your fellow creatures in battle.  



**-Jumping out of comm chair to fight with ur team:** A very good and viable tactic. Unlike marines, the alien comm doesnt really need to actively support his teammates most of the time. So you can jump out of the chair while your hives growing, or you got all upgrades your team needs. Still only do this if youre playing with a team. In pub games someone else will just jump into the comm chair, because people dont get it.  

**-Spawn camp emergency response:(thanks to flyscan)**

Here's how to respond in a pub game where early game marines get into your base and take out eggs while one of them attacks the hive. If you're not confident enough to take on marines as hero skulk in a 3v1 battle, try this:

Ensure you have resources. They will kill your resource node in the base. At the end of this battle you must have 18ish resource to cyst out and plant another resource tower. If there are already safe resource nodes outside your base things are looking good.

   *  Upgrade to a shift hive (15 res)

   * Place a shift outside of your main base (10 res + 1 res for each cyst to get you clear of base)

   * Click on the shift and purchase eggs (5 res each)

Baby skulks will be born, encourage them to work as a team, surprise attack simultaneously.

It's very much touch and go in this situation however if you've already researched shift hive, were saving for an early hive or have just jumped into the comm chair and found a lot of res at your disposal, this can give the aliens a second chance.

Overview of Evolution Branches:
---
**Shade/Veil Branch:** Stealth and Deception. This evolutionary tree is often seen as weak in pubs, but has some very powerful stratagems if the alien team can coordinate. Beware of improper usage early game, as a decent Marine Commander can counter Shade evolutions with well placed scans from an Observatory.

* **Feint** - This evolution will automatically revive the player upon death and cause the player to become invisible for a short time. It will leave behind a body and a fake death indication. You have limited movement while invisible.

    *A second chance of sorts. You will know when feint has activated when a pink filter (just like Camouflage) covers your screen. Use this to run away or to go in for the kill when an enemy marine turns away from you. Extremely useful if you want to conserve an upper lifeform.*

* **Silence** - Exactly what the label says. This trait completely removes a player's sound signature. 

    *Hearing is half the battle. This is a good tool for almost any situation you think of, especially during the early-mid game when large battles haven't started yet.*

* **Camouflage** - Turns you invisible based on your movement. When the player is completely still, he will be completely invisible (this is indicated by a pink filter and an sound byte.) Note that your view model(your teeth) will change color based on how well you are camouflaged. The more pink it is, the more camouflaged the player is.
    
    *This has many applications. You can set up ambushes, hide in plain sight, and stalk marines with it.  It's also a scouting tool, as the player can observe enemy movement indefinitely. There's nothing more satisfying than letting a marine walk into your mouth. Beware of scans, as they will uncamouflage you and reveal you on Marine's maps*

**Shift/Spur Branch:** Has a focus on speed of movement and preparation. This branch is a common first-pick due to its widespread application.

* **Celerity:** After a few seconds of traveling in the same direction, the player will begin moving with increased speed. The ability dissipates when in combat.

     *A good general ability to have if you're indecisive. It's useful for responding to hive attacks, traveling, scouting, and even for running if you can avoid getting hit by bullets.*

* **Adrenaline:** Gives the player increased energy regeneration.

     *Very useful in and out of combat, as it allows for increased ability usage. For skulks, you have increased mobility due to more lenient Leap costs. For Lerks, it means they can lay down far more Spore and Umbra clouds before they run out of juice. Fades get a heavily increased benefit due to Blink's and Vortex's heavy energy usage.*

* **Hypermutation:** This is an upgrade that allows the player to switch classes on the fly, only paying resources equal to the highest lifeform used in the player's lifespan. If the player evolves into a lower lifeform, the player will be refunded the difference in resources. It also speeds up evolution times significantly.

    *A bit of explanation: If a player evolves into a lerk, and then a fade, and then back into a lerk while he has hypermutation, he will have only paid 30 personal resources in total, gestating for a fraction of the normal duration. The implications of this evolution are STAGGERING, and I am surprised that more people do not use it. Resource management and increased evolutionary speeds can make this trait essential for players playing support roles such as the gorge and lerk. And no slouch for others aiming for fast-response evolutions.*

**Crag/ Shell Branch:** While limited, this branch has strong evolutions that make lifeforms tougher and more robust. This is the go-to branch for most pubs.

* **Carapace:** Gives the player increased armor and decreased movespeed, with increased differences the more expensive the lifeform is, with the Onos having the largest changes respectively.

    *As noted in the description, carapace affects larger lifeforms more significantly. Taking a few more bullets is never a bad thing, and in the Onos' case it's a lot more bullets.*

* **Regeneration:** After some time out of combat, the player begins to regenerate health at a constant rate.

     *Pretty much made for hit-and-run tactics or general front line shenanigans. Take this evolution for upper lifeforms to provide good survivability. Fades use this trait well.*

&gt;Ambusher and building killer. Never walk in a straight line and mostly stay off the floor, as you become a sitting duck doing that!

* The Skulk is able to walk on any surface, you can enhance this ability using the shift key, but you'll move slower when doing so. In any case you should make sure to use walls, ceilings for attack vectors and general movement!

* You can also use jumps and wall jumping to gain speed boosts to close the distance. Stay clear of grenades and mines. Make use of obstructions to take cover from fire and learn your escape routes like vents and stuff to hide behind.

* Your main role is either to harras marine outposts like resnodes or forward bases (phase gate+armory), to make sure they will spend resources and as a result slow down their economy. You should also try and take out lone marines. Only engage groups when you have more aliens with you, you can get egg locked when you die too often (eggs spawn at a rate of 10seconds per egg) The basic rule is that in early game you have a slight advantage over marines due to speed and their relative lower damage output during early game encounters. Keep in mind they can still hurt/kill you easily if you make mistakes, but the same holds true for them.

* When you have two hives, you gain leap. Use this to either escape or close the distance.

* When you attack with bite, make sure you time your bites when the marine is in clear view and near you, don't spam bite as it will make you lose track of the marines. You need three bites for low level marines and four for higher tier armored marines. Keep an eye on the so called Dubstepball. A blue shield on marines or marine structures, which will reduce your damage output significantly. This holds true for all aliens.

* You can use parasite on marines and marine structures. This will make them show up on the alien Hive Sight (explained below). It does a very small amount of damage and could in rare circumstance be used to kill a marine on low health. Marines can remove the parasite by using medkits, dropped by their commander. This will cost the marine team a small amount of resources.

**Gorge**
&gt;This creature is the healing and support class. You need to stay clear of marines or near other players that are using other classes. You can also help with speeding up construction of alien structures. A Gorge is usually safest on infestation or near hives.

* The Gorge has the ability to place mini-cysts that cost personal res and Hydras. You can help out the alien commander by spreading mini-cysts when the alien commander is lacking resources.

* Furthermore you can use Hydras to fend off marines to some extent. These structures shoot spikes, but area only effective when marines are distracted. Placed on ceilings is the best way to go, but make sure they aren't snip-able from marine territory. Use them as a trapping mechanism

* Healing is very important for both structures as players. But makes sure you have enough energy to have emergency healing available. You will also heal yourself when using the healing ability. This can be useful when you are trying to get away from marines as it will reduce the damage done to you. Just make sure you get back to safety, losing a Gorge is quite expensive for the team. You should not endanger yourself too much!

* Your movement can be sped up by using shift on infestation. You will bellyslide in the direction your face.

* You can use spit to slow down marines and make their vision blurry to some extend. This comes in quite handy, when other aliens are trying to attack them.

* Last but not least you can gain the ability to lob bile bombs, when your team has two hives, these do damage and splash damage to marine structures. It can also be used to clear out mines in an area.

**Lerk**
&gt;The lerk should be used from a distance with spikes, but can also be used close up with spores. Make sure you have lots of speed when doing this as you can be one or two shotted quite easily

* When escaping you can use spores to cover your escape to some extend.

* Lerks when used in pairs can be devastating, just keep an eye on your health as you are indeed easy to take down if you are low on speed

* Other aliens can use your spores as well to take cover while attacking the marines. So when going in for a spore run, you're not only wearing down the marines, but also obscuring their vision.

* The Lerk also has the ability to roost on walls ^[Shift ^when ^near ^walls] and attack from there using spikes. This can come in handy when spiking from the shadows over a great distance vs buildings and marines

**Fade**
&gt;The fade is a speciality hit and run/assault class that has a very potent attack. Marine lvl2 armor = 2 swipes, lvl3 armor = 3 swipes

* The main movement of the fade is blink, which is a forward teleport in which you're invulnerable, it takes quite an amount of energy mind you so keep an eye on that. As you need some energy to make it out of combat if things go wrong. When you're blinking you will leave a small trail behind, so good marines could track you and predict your teleport location.

* The basic tactic of the Fade is to do hit and run waves. You blink in, swipe a marine twice to take him down and blink back out.

* With the new addition of shadowstep and if you're confident enough you could stay near marines and harass them. Shadowstep doesn't cost any energy and makes you sidestep quickly into the direction your movement keys are pressed, it leaves puffs of smoke. During shadowstep however, you are able to take damage.

* If your energy is back to around 100%, after shadow stepping or going out of combat for a bit for heals and energy regeneration. Swoop back in and take on the next marine. Make sure you focus on one marine and make sure you get out before they shoot you as you are kind off a glass cannon.

**Onos**
&gt;The Onos is the end game class and is supposed to be used as a chaos class. It can take a lot of damage, but is quite sluggish in terms of acceleration. You are dependant on Gorges for healing and Fades/Skulks to do the final blow on enemies the Onos can't get to.

* The main tactic is to run in at top speed, gaining momentum from a long hallway and try and stun as many marines as possible and maybe even kill a few with Gore (primary attack). Don't worry about the fact that you can have trouble taking down marines. As you should have at least a few Fade/Skulks near you to take out those during the time when they are stunned or distracted by the Onos.

* Your main goal is to soak up damage, stun marines and kill a few of course. While focusing on doing loads of damage to the marine structures using the secondary attack called Smash.

* You can stun using either Gore (damage+stun on a single marine) or use stomp (right click attack) on multiple marines. Doesn't do damage.

* Stomp can also be used on structures to temporarily disable them. Very hand to delay re-spawning marines when used on Infantry portals or even Phase gates. And the Armory as well, this is where marines can get healed and repair their armor, they can also buy new weaponry here.

**Heads up Display or Hive Sight and the mini-map**
&gt;The alien HUD or Hive Sight as it's called will show you all kinds of things around the map Ranging from parasited marines/structures, marines on infestation. Your team's structures and players and will indicated if anything is under attack. All of which are shown through walls, this makes the following things possible

* You can coordinate with other aliens to attack certain areas, even without verbal communication. Because you can see if/when they are under attack, or are about to launch an attack on a marine squad.
* When you see marines or marine structures, the others on your team will also see them on the map and Hive Sight
* Your team's infestation will show marines similar to when a marine is parasited. Keep an eye on the Hive Sight and mini-map ^[Default ^key ^C] to scout for marines.

**The general rule of thumb for aliens**

* Keep moving at all times, because when you are sitting still you are an easy target. That is of course unless you have camouflage, which requires you to sit still to cloak. Or when you're setting up an ambush. Just make sure the marine commander isn't scanning the area or has an observatory nearby, otherwise you will show up on motion tracking or the mini-map for marines, even when cloaked!

* Use alien vision when needed ^[Default ^key ^F]. You can see things when not using alien vision, which you can't see in alien vision. Like being on fire, which is kinda important to know as fire isn't friendly to your health :P

Almost every time I play it, it ends with a ragequit (mind you, I don't start yelling over the microphone or anything like that, I try my best to just keep my rage to myself &lt;.&lt;) yet once I cool down again, I always start craving this game again.

Now, I know that its my skills (or lack thereof) that end up making me ragequit, but there's a few specific things that just make me rage to no end, and I'm hoping you friendly NS2'ers of reddit can help me with.

1. Marine play. I think I'm a pretty decent marine. When I can, I try to follow orders and not die, and I'm usually pretty decent with that. With a battle against a skulk, I'd say I can win 50% of the time if I see him first, otherwise I'm dead. I also try my best to stay near some teammates. Marine deaths overall don't feel too frustrating until the aliens somehow pull of a 3+ onos rush on our base, at which I usually just F4 to avoid getting killfarmed. How on earth do aliens manage to sneak around that many resources? Most of the times this happens, I wonder how on earth they managed to get that much in the way of resources.

2. Alien play (Skulk). Wow. I SUCK at anything to do with aliens. As a skulk, I almost always die unless I manage to completely catch a marine off guard when he's building, and even then, only if he's alone. I've tried jumping around to avoid bullets, but that really only disorients me even further. How do you good skulks dodge marine bullets? I always seem to die almost instantly as a skulk.

3. Alien play (Gorge). I don't have much to say about gorge....I'm alright at it, I suppose, but most khammanders don't seem to say ""hey gorge, I want you to go here"" when I gorge up early, even though I make a point of asking them where they want me.

4. Alien Play (Fade and Lerk). I figured I would combine these two, because they both fall under the same category for me of ""too good to use"". I've practiced their movements on explore mode every now and then, and I am getting decent enough at it, but I'm afraid to actually go lerk or fade because I don't want to die instantly and lose the res. I just wish someone could teach me how to use them effectively in person.

5. Alien Play (Onos). I'm a below average onos I would say. I tend to overcommit a bit too much, and I know it's a problem I need to work on. I guess for onos I want to ask, is there a point in regeneration versus carapace? Is regen only good for the pros who know exactly when to run as an onos?

6. Commanding. I actually haven't tried commanding yet, because I'm kind of afraid I'd let my team lose. I'm pretty soft spoken on my mic, though I do know the basics of commanding on both sides. Any advice on how to command your team to victory on either side?

7. Community. I've played on multiple servers now, and I've yet to really feel welcome in most games. Particularly on a couple of servers (which I won't name to be fair to them) I felt very unwelcome and like I was a burden on the team. I'd love to meet some folks who are willing to train a NS2 noob up to be a moderately skilled player. I soak up as much knowledge as I can, but knowledge only goes so far when put up against skill.

I'm sure this will probably look like a massive wall of text by the time I actually post this. I really love NS2, but playing as an alien is really frustrating because I spend more time dead than I do alive unless I play a defensive gorge. 

In conclusion, I don't want to sound like I'm bashing the game either, I know its my own lack of skill that makes me die, not that the game is super unbalanced or anything like that. Any help you guys could give me would be very much appreciated as I continue trying to (slowly) get better at NS2.

*EDIT* Just thought I'd tag this on for some more feedback. What are you guys' thoughts on alien vision? Is it good to use regularly? Bad to use regularly? Only for if the power in a room just goes out? I'd love to know how you guys use it.

*Final Edit* Thanks to all of the advice I've received, as well as some practice, I'm slowly becoming a much better NS2 player.

There aren't a lot of servers to choose from, so you're stuck with waiting for a slot on one of these servers.

What REALLY irks me, and this happens to probably 50% of the servers I join, is that the server I've been qued to join for 15-30 minutes has 1-4 observers that are just sitting there and not joining the game. Most games with such small team limits have a similar feature but for NS2 there doesn't seem to be anything in place?

For example, if the server gets full, observers get a warning that the server is full and they either have to join a team within 2-5 minutes or be booted. This frees up a spot so that people who WANT to play can actually play. Sometimes I'll join an 8v8 server and it will be 8v6 with 2 observ

Alternatively, there should be a number of observer-only slots. Servers can handle over 30 people, but the game doesn't play too well with that many people running around. If instead we have a standard 16 player server with 8 observer spots, those people could watch but add very minimal load to the server and still allow everyone who wants to play the ability to play.

This was not written by me but by someone on the ns forum. Got reposted there in 2005 but i'm unable to find the original author. Anyway this is a great read.**

Must-know etiquette for being accepted on public servers

On the marine side...

Voicecomms: Never, in any circumstances, use your microphone when anybody is shooting, building, commanding, welding, or jumping. By transmitting your futile bytes of useless information (examples: I'm in the hive, give me a pg now!/I need a weld, please), you are clogging up the game sound of the professional players, thus hindering their ability to rambo and rack up high scores. Every single sound that you make will cause fifteen cloaked skulks to spawn behind them, thus guaranteeing death.
If it's a matter of real-life life or death, then you may be permitted to transmit as long as the professional players are in the spawn queue (which is your fault because of the previous transmission). When you transmit, you must ensure that you're:
a) On a T3 connection, because every byte counts
b) a natural English speaker, without any kind of accent (be it national or regional)
c) pronouncing every word and syllable perfectly without stuttering, interruptions, feedback, or background noise.
If there are any imperfections whatsoever you will be instructed by the professionals to leave the server, fix your mic, buy a new mic, buy a new accent, buy a new voice, or go and play on a 'german haxor server'.
If you need welding but you die, it is clearly your fault for not asking people over the voicecomms. When near an empty resource node, it is also your fault if you don't call for a res node (not allowed to use comms for fear of causing death). When you ninja up to a hive and need a phase gate, you are to blame if you don't call for the gate, since the commander has you all muted for obvious reasons.

Commanding:
The command chair is a somewhat important tool used by the marines to win or lose games. If you get into the commander chair for the first time, you will immediately be to blame for every single game loss that day, regardless of which side loses. When the server crashes later from all the abuse, that will also be your fault. If you've never commanded for a national NS team, you must delete the command chair model from your NS directory, in case you accidentally face it while humping the armoury and get in. Even if you log out straight away and never touch it again, the next commander will blame everything that goes wrong in the following game on you. The loss will be put down to 'that nub idiot that got in the chair at the start'.

# If your commander dies for whatever reason during the game, you will be instructed to get inside and beacon the marines. If you get inside only to find the observatory destroyed, this is your fault. You must relocate to a horribly obscure place so that the game will drag out another 5 minutes.
# When commanding, make sure to follow every single marine 100% of the time, all at once, even if they all split up. If you find this difficult try buying multiple monitors and find a way to break the birdseye view. This will enable you to medpack the marines that get parasited once and call for medical attention. Be sure to drop resource nodes at least 1 minute before the marines get there, otherwise you will be deemed 'slow and crap'. Make sure you pay especially close attention to the professional players, and make sure there are always at least 30 medpacks and ammo containers around them, in case they ever get bitten (which is your fault).
# If you plan to command a game, make sure you already have armour 1 upgradred before you first reach the command chair. If you don't, you ae again deemed 'slow and crap'. hDon't forget to drop ammo around the armoury so the professionals don't have to copulate with it. If at any point during te game someone needs welding, it is your fault for not dropping welders.
# Within 20 seconds you should have phase tech. Another 10 seconds you should have the majority of the upgrades from the armslab, except catpacks which should be ignored because they would make you 'slow and crap', which is ironic since they do the exact opposite. Within 1 minute you should have 15 res nodes, 2 hives, and jetpacks.

Beme you sure to pay attention to the 42609872 medpack/order/ammo requests that take up all 512meg of your ram and crash your computer when a marine has to wait more than 2 seconds for your attention. As the delightful woman-ai-marine-commander-woman-girl will happily inform you, you must hit your jump key to go to the alert. This will probably move your view to a marine that's just died, or one in base that's humping the armoury for a medpack and has little patience. If you're lucky, the marine will still be alive, and will be trying to knife a fade. He will die, and blafor lack of medpacks. Sometimes this alert will take you to a squad of 5 marines who are crouching in a cloud of poison gas. Make sure you med them every 0.5 seconds in case they go below 90hp.

If you build a turret factory anywhere, you will be proclaimed a 'nub'. If you upgrade it though, the 'nub' status is removed. This is a handy way to kill hives. Never electrify anything or build any turrets, because they are obviously worthless and inferior to 7 marines that can't aim. At the same time, make sure you have at least one hive 'locked down' so that no aliens can take it over, which you must accomplish using neither mines (too expensive and get placed on your chair), or turrets, or indeed marines (they're all in double staring up at a vent that a lerk was in 9 minutes ago).

# If an onos appears, prepare for massive breakage of the various 'voicecomms' rules. Make sure you medpack the lone shotgun marine that goes to solo the onos.
# If you lose any res nodes, make sure you inform your team (not using voicecomms, remember) that the node is dying. When no-one responds and you lose the node, this is your fault because you didn't tell anyone. However, you cannot electrify it because that makes you 'new'. Make sure you always have at least 500 resources, so that people can have a jetpack for the readyroom on the offchance that you win. If you lose, you will be flamed with added petrolium every time you even look at the comm chair on that server, so change your nick and hope to God that no-one got your steamid.

Playing a marine:
This is one of the easier roles to play, because you can be completely useless and crap and it is still somehow the fault of the commander. Be sure to delete your waypoint sprites so you have an excuse not to follow them, wander aimlessly around the map asking for weapons/jetpacks/ammo at various time periods in case your commander forgets you. If he ever takes more than 2 seconds to respond, flame him, call and admin, and eject him. Tell him he's a 'cs nub olol' and he will surely take offence.

One thing you must be careful of, are the professional players. You must never go near them, just in case you steal their kill. If you save the life of such a player, surrounded by 16 onoses with only a knife out, you will still have stolen his kills. However, if he dies it is your fault (and the fault of the commander). Stay well away, because if you block them, block their shots, or make any noise whatsoever, you will immediately give away their location and be the cause of every death for the following week.
# Always go and find new res nodes to build. When you call for orders, prepare to be ignored for 3 t minutes. When the node is finally built, you mussomehow simultaneously build another node (some distance away) and protect that one at the same time. If either get bitten once, comm will recycle base and blame you for the loss.
# Make sure you follow waypoints, even obscure ones that are randomely given to you because the commander is using the 'select all marines' button. If you're sitting in a hive that's going up waiting for a phase gate and he medspams you so the aliens hear, it's your fault for being low on health.
# If you see a phase gate, you must phase through in case the other end is being attacked, so you can get raped by a bunch of hungry skulks. At the same time, if you see a phase gate you mustn't phase through, just in case there's another, more important gate going up elsewhere.
# You must be in base, at every node, and every hive, and killing aliens, all at the same time. If you can't multitask to this extent, you are a useless cs player.

Come to realise that the comm screaming 'kill that fade omg 1 bar left WTH useless die argh recycling' means that you failed to kill the fade, and it's entirely your fault. Negate umbra, 5 onoses, 34 gorges, a hive, and the fact that you had no ammo - it is entirely your fault. If any teammates were there, they will also most likely blame you, for blocking them.

* 
Patchnotes:


**Feature**

* 
All-new marine HUD.

* 
Added marine ""Banner"" notifications added for important events such as game start, power loss, and Hive death.

* 
New alien ""banner"" notifications to tell you game objective, research complete, evolutions lost, etc.

* 
Unchained alien lifeforms from hives. Now Fade is available at Hive 1 and Onos at Hive 2. However, not all abilities will be available (ie, Blink only available with 2 hives, etc.)

* 
Lowered costs for many marine upgrades to help 'smooth out' tech tree and give more viable game choices.

* 
Added ""emergency"" egg spawning where aliens spawn much faster when many are dead (addresses alien ""egg lock"")


**Fix**

* 
Fixed hitches/poor performance caused by streaming ambient sounds from disk

* 
After dropping a med/ammo pack there will be now 0.75 seconds delay before you can select another unit with left click. this prevents accidentally selecting a Marine when dropping multiple medpacks (and would kick you out of the assist menu)

* 
Already evolved upgrades in the Alien buy menu appear in red in case the upgrade is inactive (for example all 

* 
Carapace Shells are destroyed and you have the Carapace upgrade)

* 
Added camera tilt for death animation and first person blood effect.

* 
Removed crosshair text, instead you will see now a health circle.

* 
Fixed issue where label transitions in the animation graph would not be prioritized over explicit transitions if they had a longer blend time.

* 
Fixed bug where the reference pose for a model wasn't taken into account when generating the navigation mesh.

* 
Fixed a bug that caused players to get ""pulled back"" once they start to accelerate (related to spit slowing to 90%)

* 
Fixed bug where the collision geometry was incorrect for some static props.

* 
The Builder now uses the correct 3rd person model.

* 
Fixed a bug where carapace would not be granted automatically in case you had it before and re-build a 
carapace shell.

* 
Fixed bug where evolve costs were calculated wrong.

* 
Fixed bug where harvester build time is not affected by catalyst.

* 
Fixed bug with minimap not showing all units for spectators.

* 
Fixed a bug where bilebomb direct hits would not cause full damage.

* 
Fixed a bug where Lerk could continue firing Spikes even when at 0 energy.

* 
Fixed bug where spore cloud effects are sometimes not visible on the client.

* 
Fixed bug where ARC was doing twice as much damage as it should have (1800 instead of 900)

* 
Commanders see now the health percentage at the health bar instead of overall percentage (before it was health + armor combined, which caused confusion when dropping medpacks)
Fixed bug where sometimes the animation graph would move away from the initial node too early after resetting the graph.

* 
Fixed bug where bitmap fonts were not properly centered vertically.

* 
Fixed bug where builder first person effect is not disappearing.


**Balance**


* 
Reduced Onos speed a bit and increased Stomp range to fit the visual effect.

* 
Reduced jetpack cost from 20 to 10.

* 
Changed mines to detonate other mines within 3 meters (was 4)

* 
Reduced mine arm time from 0.22 to 0.17 seconds.

* 
Reduced Rifle melee damage from 35 to 20.

* 
Removed Frenzy and Swarm (no longer fit anywhere, and make Fade too harsh)

* 
Increase cyst/mini cyst build time from 1 second to 4/6 seconds.

* 
Reduced Command Station cost to 15.

* 
Increased Command Station health from 2000 to 3000 health (so Marines don’t have to constantly respond to attacks or leave Marine in base always)

* 
Reduced Robotics Factory costs from 20 to 15.

* 
Added upgraded 'ARC Robotics Factory' (costs 10, upgrade time 40 seconds) which is required to produce ARCs.

* 
Reduced ARC cost from 20 to 10.

* 
Reduced prototype lab cost from 40 to 30.

* 
Reduced jetpack research cost from 35 to 25.

* 
Reduced advanced armory cost to 20.

* 
Adjusted Lerk bile bomb damage, energy cost, etc. so it doesn't take too long to bring down structures, but also so they aren't taken down instantly (thanks SabaHell and Sr Lance!)

* 
Reduced Fade Swipe damage from 70 to 65 (increases # of hits to kill an unarmored Marine from 1 to 2 and a Armor L2 Marine from 2 to 3)

* 
Decreased Catalyst time from 10 seconds to 5.

* 
Adjusting Fade shadow step to be more about tactics instead of a big combat advantage. Reduced duration from 0.08 to 0.45.

* 
Increased time in the dark after power is down from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.

* 
Changed sprinting back to b199 values.

------------------------

**The Siege(Natural Selection)**

I was still fairly new to the game, and was still learning the Marine Tech Tree. When I joined the server, the Aliens had just built their 3rd hive. This usually meant that the game was going to end soon, as Tier 3 Alien Tech was nothing short of devastating against silly humanoids with their peashooters. Of course, I didn't know that. I just knew we were losing.

In our case, we were slowly being pushed back into our base, and things were slowly climaxing into a Last Stand, in which the winner would be fairly clear. After dying a few dozen times, I kind of gave up and made a little challenge to see if I can run past all the aliens and play hide-and-seek after the base was destroyed (the game didn't end until all players and structures on one team were dead). 

I found myself a little hiding spot in a vent, when the Marine Commander noticed me there. 

""What are you doing there?""

""Hiding.""

A phase gate template appears on the floor before me.

""Build that instead.""

And so, I did, not really thinking about what could happen next. It's not like I had anything to lose. The Phase Gate whirs to Life, and my team pours out of the structure, busily preparing new buildings... right next to the alien hive! I slowly realized what was about to happen. 

Not long afterwards, Large Pinging Turrets were swiveling around, all lined up against the walls closest to the Alien Base. Marines were phasing in and out of the gate in both the defense of the Main Base and the preparation of the operation to come. 

We were finally all set. The Commander gave the instruction to invade the Hive Room, and proceeded to scan the area. Those swiveling turrets all zero'd in on the Hive, and proceeded to fire through the walls, making the the coolest explosion sounds I'd ever heard in a video game. We entered the room and obliterated every last trace of Alien vermin we could see. It was over in less than a minute. 

The aliens had lost a Hive. Noting the loss of Tier 3 tech, we managed to push em back to the middle of the map, and the game continued.

------------------------

**The Ambush (Natural Selection)**

I had put in a fair amount of hours into the game at this point, and now knew most of workable strategies in pubbie games. This round, our team decided to do something off-kilter: Sensory Chambers. 

This provided the Kharaa with some interesting evolutionary options, the most notable one being the cloaking ability. Back in NS1, SCs were usually a pretty bad idea to tech first. They were easily counter-able if the Marine Commander so much as had an inkling of intelligence.

We did it anyway. We were pretty well organized for a pub, since a lot of us were regulars on the server and played with each other often. About 2/3rds of our team set up in Cargo Storage. This room was pretty important, as denying this area cut off easy access to a hive location as well as a good chunk of the Resource Points. Typically, there would be at least 3-4 marines heading over to secure Cargo.

This time? The whole team. We watched in cloaked silence from the walls and ceilings as the marine team started building several structures, including a Command Center. The Marines were going to switch bases right in front of us! Our de-facto leader signaled the go over voice chat. I was laughing maniacally as a dozen skulks and I had materialized out of thin air and began to slaughter them.

Since i picked up NS2 i'm constantly looking to get better and better at this game. Obviously the biggest room for improvement is on mastering alien Lifeforms, marines are bascially straight-forward when you played multiple shooters imo :)
The one lifeform i cant seem to get good with is Fade. I know the basic movements thing like shadowstep =&gt; jump =&gt; jump. 
After watching some competitive casts i noticed that i'm really far from being as mobile and scary as those ninja fades in the hands of skilled players. 
Those fades seems so hard to hit, always going-in going-out dishing damages. I tried in pub but with very little success.
Do you guys know any good in-eyes or tutorial video about playing fade ?

However, I commed once, and it didn't go over so well, and my teammates weren't so receptive of my failures. It was pretty humiliating, being the sole reason our team lost the match. Other than the training thing (where you're playing against no one), it would be nice to have some sort of system that you can practice being com without letting a team down or humiliating yourself.

**[Poster!](http://imgur.com/gXag4)**

**About:** 

So after finishing our second tournament we all got right back to work planning another tournament for you guys. The only difference! This one is going to be bigger. We are making posts on the UWE forums and other NS2 websites

**Event Info**

* This Tournament will take place on December 7th and 8th, this Friday and Saturday. On Friday the tournament will start at 9 PM EST to account for West coast players getting home from what not. On Saturday the second part of the tournament will begin at 6 pm EST.
* This tournament will take place in the NA servers, although we aren't barring EU or Oceania players from this tournament you will have to deal with the higher latency from NA servers. Sorry for the inconvenience guys.
* Signups will be done by individuals, this is a casual tournament and not a team tournament. When you sign up you will be placed on a team based on your skill level so that all teams are relatively even.
* When you signup you will select a skill level on the form and teams will be weighted so all teams are relatively even.
* The tournament will be a best of 3, single elimination bracket styled tournament.
* Teams will be made up of 8 players, this is an 8 v 8 tournament.
* Due to our limited servers and not wanting to go over time, we are limiting this to 16 teams, first come first serve!
* You will be given 10 minute breaks inbetween rounds to go to the bathroom, grab drinks, whatever you need. But we will not be having 30 minute long breaks inbetween rounds.
* We will be using Docking, Tram, and Summit as our primary maps and Veil will be the 3rd game tie breaking map.

**Signups**

To sign up go [Here](http://transistorcollective.net/dev/ns2/) and sign in through the steam API. Just a note, the only thing we get from you logging in through steam is your steamID. Once you are logged in fill out the form and sign up for the tournament! Its that simple.

Another note, the website is constantly being worked on and updated so there are a few bugs that you might find. We are aware of them and Mervill our web developer is currently working to iron them out.

If you have any other questions about signing up feel free to leave a message.

* Each team's assigned server will also be added to the bottom of this post.
* Do not join a server if your team is not assigned to it!
* In Game
 * Both teams will join the server and stay in the ready room
 * The first round map will be Docking, the second will be Tram, and the third/finals will be Summit. The third game tie breaking map will be Veil. If we have more then 3 rounds then we will recycle maps.
 * The referee will switch the server to the correct map.
 * The team captains will walk into the ""Random"" and that will be their team for the first game, the teams will switch sides for the second game. If a third round is needed then the teams captains will walk into random again to decide what side they play.
 * When both commanders have typed ""Ready"" in chat, the referee will use the sv_reset command to officially start the match.
 * When a team has won two matches the referee will message me with the score.

**Dropouts and No-shows**

* If you are missing somebody from your team and have not heard from them by the time the tournament starts message Old_Greg on steam and I will get a replacement player for you.

* If you find that you cannot make it to the tournament for whatever reason message SourceIamA on Reddit ASAP (Or Old_Greg on steam).

* **Notes**
 * If you have any questions or comments please feel free to message me on reddit or on steam.

Although I preordered NS2 over 3 years ago my current rig is a little dated so the game is basically unplayable for me. I've read a lot of mixed reviews but have yet to try it out it myself. 

I'm really curious to see what those of you who played NS1 religiously (you know who you are) think about NS2 and how it compares to the original. What do you like better? What do you miss about the original? Is it worth upgrading my PC for?

- Mines over doorways: I had been getting wrecked by Lerks recently, so I decided to try setting Lerk traps. I bought a pack of mines and found a doorway where I believed a Lerk was actively travelling. Placed all three mines on the ceiling of the doorway.

Favorite is tough but I'd say summit. I really like how crevice is a wide open beautiful graphics area that is fun to lerk camp out. I also like having 5 bases. I also like how there aren't fixed starting bases like you have to find it. Also the map is well made with a good variety of vents and res nodes and wide open enough for marines to have a fighting chance against the OP aliens in pub play (wide areas / longer hallways means onos' have to run further to reach the exos while the exos unload. This map usually leads to more strategy team play.



Whatever that map is called with sorting is a very very close second and at times I like it more. Honnestly while thinking about it now I prefer veil but I already typed out all that stuff about summit so I won't delete it haha. It is epic with same 5 base set up except also a big resources middle room. Variety of big room bases and small room bases - amazing. My favorite.



Least favorite: the map with mezzanine (I think it is tram?) I hate that map.

For instance, you could say, ""Bile Bomb is a gorge attack that does heavy damage to buildings and to marine armor. It is especially effective against exosuits.""

In the first 20 mins it looked like it was all over afte rwe only had one tech point left.Then we managed to push back using ARC's and a few ninja phase gates here and there.Not to mention the aliens kept using Onos after Onos but somehow we managed to kill them and we didn't even have exos. Also I had great synergy with my team they constantly calling out check alien hives and points of interest, but the best part was I WAS the commander. Being that I've still got alot to learn about commanding I was filled with joy when we won. All in all I just fell in love with this game.

Just recently started streaming and figured I'd post a link here. Will be streaming some NS2 pub play for the next few hours and will be playing a lot of Lerk.

Unfortunately I do not have a second monitor set up atm, so I will not be able to constantly monitor chat, but I'll try to tab out and keep my eye on it every so often and try to answer anything that I can.

*Edit* OFFLINE for the evening. Adding link for tonight's play session below the previous one(s).

First 54 minutes are on a small 3v3 setting, then hopped into a more full server for the rest of the evening.

When i promised i would try to make a couple and see how it goes i didn't realized you can do this in american football, but not so much for NS2, it needs to be dynamic as the game itself. However, i tried to make one for Veil to see how it goes.

If there is any interest in this i would rather do it as interactive stream and maybe we can be on mumble and in game so that people can participate, while sharing Google doc or something to draw our plans.

-----------------------------------------

**Hero Gambit**

Reasoning behind this opening is you sacrifice one side of the map to push for important POI (Point Of Interest). On Veil that is definetly the double RT in Nano, if that works out you effectively denied Aliens resources while you obtained 2 defensible RTs.

Picture: [http://imgur.com/nvG61](http://imgur.com/nvG61)

1. GREEN: You need to pick a hero, marine who knows how to survive while 3 skulks munch his ankles, the best one man army on your team. This guy goes to Skylights area and tries to hold off any pressure. He is also supposed to die and not build RT, maybe just a powernode. You leave one marine, builder, in base who builds armory and obs for you to research PGs. Rest of your team, fireteam charlie, goes to Topo, builds power and RT while 2 guys are on the watch at all times. You should have your hero spawning in base and second RT in Topo. Phase 1 complete

2. CYAN: Your builder and hero are now holding west entrance to your base and charlie is trying to safely get into east junction, scout nano. If you get rushed, comm can jump out and you should be able to hold with 3 marines. If any member of charlie dies he can actually check on Topo RT on his way back to charlie. Phase 2 complete.

3. BLUE: Build PG at home, and push to Nano if viable and build PG there or build one at East junction and start pushing Nano hard with all marines (watch your PGs, PNs, IP and defend if needed), after acquiring Nano, sell PG in East (if used for push). 

Conclusion: You have nano, hurray or if you don't acquire Nano quickly or at all you just lost the game. But with PG in East you should be able to push C-12, Neck and Pipes to acquire 2nd tech point.

Alternative: You find Aliens starting in Pipes, hero builds Skylights RT, you can get PGs 10sec earlier, hero can reinforce Nano trough West and after Nano you take Cargo/Sub or push Pipe hard.

All this is based on 6v6, for 8v8 add 1-2 marines to charlie and 1-0 marine as hero support.

-----------------------------------------

There is lot of ifs and buts, but that is a nature of the beast, NS2 is dynamic game and you have to improv a lot. I am not saying this is best and only split/strat possible, i have done it to see if there is any interest in these and to show some possibilities. Of course it will be very hard to coordinate at pubs, but i tried to make it simple enough so if there is any team communication it can be done hopefully.

Also my Marine Comm isn't that strong and this strat is mostly theory, however, i hope this discussion isn't gonna be about me but the strats/playbook itself. I would like to know if there is any interest in these and see if we could get together and make interactive stream about this topic - hopefully including mumble and ns2 server with tell and show.

Thank you for reading, Vindaloo out!

----------

EDIT: I don't think i communicated the idea across right to you guys - this is just one possibility, made to be easily explained, done and followed, lets call it opening. It's supposed to take care of the early game. I did this to see if it is possible and if you would like to see more or cooperate on building the actual playbook. It doesn't have to be original idea, you can analyze competitive game and see if that is anything translatable to lower skill levels.

So discussion should be if this format is OK, optimization or critique of this build and if you would like to participate in the stream/workshop/playbook happening. If you got your own build order to share, please make it easy to understand, explainable and repeatable. Not really the overall strats and end goals for Veil. Please keep it on topic.

It lasted maybe forty minutes but wasn't boring at all (neither was it for the aliens, as we heard at the end).

It was on docking. We had everything in our favor quite early (Cafeteria, Terminal and Departure, all upgrades and phase gates at each base). We just unlocked Exos when the tide turned. 

They attacked us at an incredibly fast pace, attacking one base, then another, etc. They killed our Exos at Generator while we were at Terminal repairing the damages of their last attack that forced us to beacon. They took Cafeteria, phase gate first, while we were at Departure expanding to Generator. They took Terminal as we finished defending and tried expanding (again) to Generator. Then they finished us at Departure from Generator. Add unsucceful (or maybe after all) attacks in between takes, and a Generator hive killed and regained, and you have a half of the match.

All of this was done by three Onos and two or three gorges. They had Celerity for sure, we couldn't chase them down. They were super quick to destroy things (Bile bomb) so it was very hard to defend. We tried our best to kill the Onos, but in the end we only killed one out of three, at a moment where they weren't super careful (i think they could have saved them all).

Even though i had *a lot* of fun playing this game (maybe the best game i've played yet) i would prefer beeing able to win in this situation.

Is there any way to beat multiple Onos healed by multiple Gorges ? We really got crushed by them and couldn't figure the situation out.

We will still announce pugs once or twice a week on the main group as well.  Everyone is welcome regardless of experience with ns2 (as long as you don't mind doing what I tell you what to do).  We form teams on mumble (74.86.55.132) and play anything from 6v6 to 8v8.  We've peaked at running two 7v7 games with 28 people playing at once.  

Join the group and enjoy some slightly more organized ns2.  I promise not to data-mine your information... that much.

I made the site ns2commander to host gameplay guides, but it looks like the steam guides are much more useful. 

I completely redesigned the site, and I am going to focus on writing about competitive play and listing streams. 

If you have a moment I would love some ideas or feedback. http://www.ns2commander.com 

I'm still making changes so things may move around.

So here goes:

* When helping build a hive as a gorge, does spitting (can't recall the ability name) on the hive *after* it's at full health still increase the build speed?

* Can gorges speed up upgrade research?

* Does using the welder to build things construct them faster?

A look into auto-balancing.,AmuseDeath,21,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/17fdvc/could_the_lack_of_balanced_teams_be_the_biggest/,"So NS2 differs from many other games because the sides play extremely asymmetrically. As such, there are more concepts to learn and another completely different set of game mechanics to understand. What also sets NS2 apart from other games is the inclusion of the ready room, which allows players to pick their team of choice. But we get to the age old problem of team-stack, meaning all of the best players get on one team. The issue with this is that in a game like NS, team-stack can pretty much determine the game's outcome in the first few minutes.

If either team cannot get beyond their first hive, let alone resource node, the game is effective decided. If the game forced the best players to be divided equally at the expense of choosing their team of choice, would that be better overall for the game? Or perhaps an algorithm could be developed that would allow players to vote on a team they would PREFER to join and then the game would try its best to grant those wishes, while distributed an equal amount of skilled players on each team.

What happens a lot is that you have a game going and its clearly over from the start, but new players don't seem to get this because they don't open the map. Then more people join the server because it's one of the few that has a good amount of people and ping, but the game does not end. Then the game does end and then you have all the people leave with the new players being frustrated at the stack and the others disappointed that they joined in the middle of a losing game. Then you have more people linger in the ready room and then yea, maybe the server will empty.

Maybe the readyroom is a problem in itself? Other games have matches start one after another automatically so that people keep playing, rather than having the players ask themselves, do I want to play another round?",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,1359390776.0,,lerk,True,t3_17fdvc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/17fdvc/could_the_lack_of_balanced_teams_be_the_biggest/,

I have some Suggestion for the next patch.

As people have already figured, Skulks seem to basically be alien dogs. Gorges are very alike to pigs. Lerks are the roosters and Onos are alien bulls and cows. 

I want to propose more interactivity between the lifeforms. 
So... 
Other lifeforms should be able to milk the Onos cows. 
Obviously the milk should at least at minimum be tradable with the humans. 
In return the Human Federation supplies the Kharaa with the finest baltic girls. What kind of perverted evolutionary breeding program the Kharaa are up to is not of your bussiness.
Everyone earns on a flourishing trade I say. The growing economy and improved understanding from the inter-racial activity will naturally lead to a world of peace, for months will our people live and build the perfect world on one single server. The Thirsty Onos Bar franchise would thrive and expand its business all over the six playable maps.
I am no prophet but its obvious Onos cheese would be quite the hit with the soldiers. 
A bit of cheese in your pockets would improve the moral, dont you think?
Your ambassador is welcomed in our pit, we need to maintain good communication. I am beginning to grow worried about those night patrols of yours... You dont want the Onos milk pipeline to dry up would you?

Sadly, its in your nature to start to abuse the Onos milk, I have heard rumors that soldiers on the street have begun to initiate Onos milk extract right into their eye sockets!? 

Today; 5 years have passed since the legendary Onos milk Patch, NS3 is around the corner, and your paranoia have lead our relation into a new cold war. 
Today is the day when all hell breaks loose. Billions of lifeforms and exos crash into a blazing inferno with guns blazing, every steam player knew this day would come. The war is a tragic sight to behold, at least for those few with eye sockets still intact. Soldiers laying in piles with Onos milk withdrawal syndrome is quite the sight. 
Tho your time have passed, natural selection is at work and your greed gave me the key. Have you been introduced to my daughter? She has quite the temper for a four year old. ",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,1352065531.0,,,True,t3_12mplp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/12mplp/suggestion_for_onos/,

I have a few questions for you NS vets and betamongers. I used to play a lot of Q2:Gloom and the release of NS2 has made me excited about the prospect of having something similar but new so I've pre-ordered it. 

Now, I didn't find out about it until the steam release so I've had no chance to try the beta. And I never actually played NS1 either since back when it was released, we still had a healthy community of gloom players.

If anyone is familiar with both games, I would really appreciate a general rundown of how the dynamics differ. Now, I've watched some vids and streams to get a general idea but it's hard to get an idea beyond basic mechanics (class and weapon dynamics, balance, metagame) without playing yourself for a period of time.

The most obvious difference, of course, is the commander mechanic and the RTS depth that brings, which I find really fascinating. At the same time I dread its importance in more casual public play and I was hoping someone could shed light on the importance of that role.

The next thing I'm wondering about are the classes. I'm more into alien so I'm most curious about the potential of the early alien classes -- in gloom, a good hatchling (zero cost combat class) has decent odds against 1-2 pt classes and with some luck can even take out 3-4 pt ones -- is the point system balance in NS2 similar?

Then there's the base building aspect. In gloom games would often progress to the dominant team building a forward base and offensive placing of ""defensive"" structures could be quite viable. Often teams would also try to hide spawns in faraway, hidden or difficult to access spots. Do these kinds of strategies exist in NS2? If not, what sort of choices do you have?

And finally I would like to ask about maps. Many if not most gloom maps have both indoors and outdoors areas where the vertical dimension can play a big role, too. So far from what I've seen NS2 seems to have mostly indoors corridors (not all indoors are alike, of course). I'm wondering what role height (if you will) plays in NS2 -- are there places inaccessible by certain classes? Are there many open areas in general?

Any general advice is appreciated, too. Thanks in advance and really looking forward to getting to paly!",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,,True,t3_11fj77,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/11fj77/old_gloomer_here_what_should_i_expect_from_ns2/,

How to hide:
---

As one might guess, the best ways to conceal yourself as a Skulk would be to stay around the far corner or inside a vent.

However, there will be specific situations where letting a Marine pass by your location will be favorable.

**Small Corridors/Rooms:** Marine eyesight will usually be drawn down the natural path of the hallway. Hide beyond the edge of normal peripheral vision, typically in the opposite direction of the path.

*Example: If a small hallway takes a right turn, it would be best to hide in a corner upwards to the left.*

[Shitty Diagram](http://i.imgur.com/vkAXA)

**Large Corridors/Rooms:** In these kinds of areas, vision will be drawn naturally outwards and upwards towards the ceiling and walls. Hide in the lower, less elevated areas of the room.

Always be vigilant. Good marines will check their corners, and if that happens, you will be forced to fight or die.

How to track targets:
---

* **PARASITE EVERYTHING THAT MOVES (and doesn't).**

As covered in part 1, **parasited targets can be seen through walls by you and your team.**

Now, have you ever played other multiplayer FPS games? 
Do you know what they call people who can see through walls? *Hackers.* It's cheating. 

You, as a Skulk in NS2, get to see through walls for free as a gameplay mechanic. Being able to gauge a parasited enemy's location is so immensely useful that it should be your first course of action upon encountering any Marines. In addition, it can also help you keep track of enemy structure placements.

* **Use vents whenever you can.**

Never reveal your presence to a Marine if you can help it. Using vents, you can safely follow Marines without having to worry about getting shot at. They are also, on occasion, faster than traveling normally as well.

* **Be quiet.**

In the same vein, be sure to reduce your audio signature as well. Make sure to Stalk(holding shift to move slower and mitigate sound signature) whenever you are nearby other enemies.  The Silence upgrade removes all sound that originates from you, so this is extremely good to have on-hand.

---

How to ambush targets:
---

* **Attack from a point outside of the target's cone of vision.**

I've seen a lot of skulks die unfortunate deaths simply because they jumped directly into the barrel of a Marine's gun. Don't do it. The most favorable point is to attack from directly behind a Marine.

* **Plan an escape**

Sometimes, you'll plan a guerilla attack on a group, or fail to kill your target properly. In cases like these, be sure to *get to the closest possible exit*. Time saved escaping is also time you're not getting shot at. As I said in Part 1; you are squishy.

[Another shitty diagram](http://i.imgur.com/ZlFj5)

* **Leap!**

All aliens become significantly more deadly when their alternate abilities are researched. Skulks are no exception. Leap can be used to close gaps between yourself and marines quickly, as well as to dodge fire. Be warned though, that the Leap ability has a distinct and noticeable audio signature, so even a dumb Marine can be alerted to your presence before you are able to start chomping away.

---

TL;DR
---
* When hiding in tight corridors, tuck yourself in a corner away and above natural peripheral vision.
* Alternatively, hide yourself towards the bottom of larger areas, as the human eye is drawn towards the top.
* Parasite before you bite!
* Use the vents
* Be Quiet!
* Don't get in front of a Marine under any circumstance.
* Plan an escape.
* Use leap to close gaps and to dodge fire.

It is over twice as slow as the main attack and uses up 20 precious energy that I could be using to blink with. Hardly anyone sits still long enough to get hit by the attack, unless they are blocked in, because of the slowing effect that starts as soon as you initiate the attack. If you are standing in melee range of a marine when you start the attack, by the time you swing to deal the damage the marine can walk out of range of the attack without even having to use sprint. The only reason I can see using it at all would be in a later build where the exoskeletons are in for the marines, but that is only *IF* you can cause them damage with the attack. They will probably be slow enough to use the attack on, but it comes down to if their armor counts along the lines of structures, since the secondary attack does no damage to structures. I am not asking for the move to be changed to something better. What I am asking for is the removal of the attack. It is my opinion that Fades have too much health as it is making them slightly overpowered so changing the secondary attack to be useful would just make them over the top.

Main attack (A1): 70 Damage

Speed: 0.65

Energy: 7

Secondary Attack (A2): 160 damage

Speed: 1.55

Energy: 20

Lets look at energy efficiency:

A1: 70/7=10 damage per energy

A2: 160/20=8 damage per energy

In conclusion, the main attack is more efficient and therefore does more damage faster than the secondary attack AND without the crippling ""slow"" effect. With two swings of A1 being enough to kill a marine and since A2  causes no damage to structures there is currently no reason to ever use A2.

It was pretty late game (~45min in) and as Marine commander, we pushed for one of the Hives (Cargo). At this point, the game had been a stalemate with map control generally split between the two sides (nano switched hands numerous times). Aliens had two hives.

As the push was going in to Cargo, we had a large push from the Aliens into our main base (Control). At this point, we had two bases (Control and Sub) and we locked down Nano. 

Factors to consider:
- We had a few exos, and only a few marines. 
- Beaconing would only grab those few marines, which would leave exos without welders
- The base was being attacked by lots of fades and lerks, which the marines may have difficulty with.
- It was on the other side of the map, the exos probably wouldn't make it in time and get ambushed somewhere on the way.
- We had a LOT of resources and all the upgrades (200 that I kept spamming on gifts to the troops).

If you were commanding, should we push on, or beacon/ask-everyone-to-run-like-a-jack-rabbit back to base?

TL;DR: If one team does a push, and the other does a push on the other side on a significant base (on the OTHER side of the map), should we continue the push or pull back to defend? 

---

What actually happened:
- While I dithered... we lost power just as I hit beacon and so I asked to continue the push. The push wasn't going anywhere after a whole minute, hardly making it's way through the entranceway so we headed back to Control. Torched EVERYTHING as the Alien scum were already building a hive, and rebuilt everything in a few minutes.

We eventually won with lots and lots of exos, and a very demoralized/frustrated alien team, but it occurred to me that we used up a lot of resources that I could've spent on equipment just to rebuild everything, and perhaps it would've been better to back off and regroup after fending off the attack.

I don't mean a game where the commander has no idea what he's doing and you end up with 1 extractor and turrets in your main base at the 5 min mark. No, I mean a genuine strategy the commander really thinks could work. I'll start:



**Fast second command station + IP rush**

The build: extractor, extractor, command station, Infantry portal

The goal: Fast distributed map presence and fast respond times from two IP's

The flaw: We died before getting the second IP up and then the second base died.





**Map presence shift build**

The build: extractor, shift hive, extractor, shift, shift, shift

The goal: using the three spread out shifts and their egg spawn function the goal was fast response times. And a quick contain of the marines.

The flaw: 3 shifts plus spawning eggs is a real resource drain. Not enough extractors to drive this. The marines were contained though, but they invested all their cash in useful things. So, by the time we dropped our second hive (12 minute mark), the marines pushed and owned.




**Arc surprise**

The build: At some point in the game decide to make arcs, never use arcs, make more arcs, rinse and repeat, wait and then: obliterate hives

The goal: Make so many arcs that the opponent doesn't have time to react. Kill the hive.

The flaw: Bile bomb.

*Vortex:* In my opinion this skill is too expensive, too short, and costs too much for the commander to research to be worth it. You also need three hives for it. 

*Xenocide:* Because you need three hives, by the time you can even think about getting this skill, the marines will already have armor 2 or 3, which severely limits it's potential.

It's no secret these skills are the most under-used in the game. What can we do to fix them? I can't really think of anything for vortex except an all-around buff, but for xenocide? I feel like it should only need 2 hives, and should cost only 20 res to research. This way, you can get it in the mid-game if you choose to really put the pressure on the marines.

Marines' seige unit is now mobile and heavy armor is now a giant mech. They don't have a heavy machine gun, but they do have a flame thrower now. They obtain further unlocks by securing more commander chairs, similar to how the aliens work with hives. In fact, the locations where aliens drop hives are the same locations for commander chairs. Marines cannot weld shut vents currently.

Aliens have most of their original abilities.

Gorges can't web anymore and their bile bomb does stackable damage over time. They don't build chambers, the alien commander does, but they can help with building chambers and drop an offense chamber like entity called a hydra, as well as a ""clog"" which is a big nasty ball of crap that can stick to walls and other clogs blocking off areas from marines or allowing aliens to climb on them.

Skulks are almost identical to NS1, but leap doesn't do damage anymore and bites do less damage the less direct they are.

Lerks have their needles back from earlier versions of NS1. Their spore is not ranged, but instead requires the lerk to ""crop dust."" Umbra is still ranged and works identical to NS1, though. They don't have primal scream anymore.

Fades don't metabolize, nor have acid rockets. They start with a free, stunted version of blink called shadow step. They also have an ability called vortex now that basically voids everything. Things inside of the vortex take no damage nor deal any, as well as buildings ceasing to function.

Onii have sadly lost the ability to devour marines. They still do everything else the same, but stomp now knocks the marines to the ground instead of locking them in place.

The aliens have a commander now. He drops structures onto infestation that he's grown by placing a network of cysts. You can still only have on upgrade tree per hive, with the same type of upgrades. There's no more focus, redemption, or scent of fear. You cannot teleport from hive to hive. The ""movement chamber"" of NS2 is the Shift and it has an additional ability to spawn eggs, which are spawn points for aliens. This allows alien commanders to control the flow of his team. The commander's version of the offense chamber is the Whip, which does short range damage to marines as well as deflecting grenades. The commander also has an NPC unit called a drifter which is a scout that he can move around the map and can release an enzyme which speeds the attack of aliens nearby. Finally, the commander can create a bone wall, which is a wall that rises from the ground to block the escape or pursuit of marines.

I think that covers it all. Hope to see you in-game!

We started in Repair, and aliens in Sorting. We took Deposit early on, limiting to two hives for aliens. Cave went up quickly, leap was on the field, but we kept north harvester under duress, and crushing and caverns in constant attack.

I generally sat in 4-5 RTs, as usual for me, and tried for double, but it honestly went back and forth, especially late game.

Onii hit the field earlier with egg drops, but we were prepared. A good Robotics factory in Deposit keeps the onos away from my beacon machine. :P

We teched up decently, but the onii got too much, and we lost Operations. Third hive going up.

Did you know the powernode for the Gap works all the way to the door for Operations? A PG in the hall makes easy work of Operations, until we lost it again, and A few Onii kept it clear.

We got full tech, and Exos defended base, macs repaired, JP marines kept nodes and double busy, and we were getting lost in a stalemate. 

After having to beacon between Deposit and Repair about 4 times in two minutes, a few of my exos in Deposit got pissed in Repair and took Sorting of their own initiative. Two light marines welded, and I didn't even notice until they were mowing down the hive. A lone exo too Operations while aliens scrambled to get Sorting back.

Suddenly three Exos are in North, alone, and pressuring Cave. Aliens redropped Operations, and hit Repair hard.

All in all, we were fighting at LEAST 6 onos at one point with only 2 Exo, and my marines were communicating extremely well and we kept res nodes constantly in flux.  The amount of teamwork and pressure was amazing. Beaconing to stop three onos in one base, only to have them phase immediately to save the other from three more

One other thing you can have the fade do is before you all rush in to an unsuspecting marine base you can Vortex the arms lab leaving the marines easily killed when the rest of your team rushes in.

As the fade your already a killing machine just simply vortex 1 marine in a group of 3 and that battle is in your favor. Also being able to take out any machinery for 5 seconds seems awesome to me.

Hey everyone. This is [C.H.U.D.] from the r/ns2 steamgroup. This **Saturday the 15th at 7pm EST** we will be hosting a team tournament.

Mumble information will be provide. 

 The teams will be 6 players each. It will be best of 3 single elimination and the finals will be best of 5. This for team sign ups. Anyone is welcome to join. Just form a team and sign up on our [Battlefy link.](http://battlefy.com/chud/112/rns2-team-tournament-1/#/info)

Each Tier of the tournament will be played on set maps. Tier 1 is Docking. Tier 2 is Summit. Tier 3 is Tram. The first 2 games are played on the Tier map and the third will be the tiebreaker map Veil. For the third and final Tier we will play 2 rounds on Tram alternating the sides between games and then two on Veil with the third tiebreaker on Tram again.

To pick sides the team captains will just run in random and that will be it. Play a round and then switch sides. For the tiebreaker we will do one more random to pick the sides.

For the finals, since it is best of 5, we will do 3 random team picks. First one will be for the first round of Tram games and then again when we go to Veil for two games and then the third when/if we get to a final Tram game.

Again, anyone is welcome to join but expect this to be a bit more competitive than our casual sign ups tournaments. Just have fun and keep it friendly. Any unsportsmanlike conduct won't be tolerated. We are being streamed and would like to keep it classy. Monocles on and pinkies out.

Our casters are [Vindaloo](http://ns2hub.com/streams/vindalo0), [SusanTD](http://ns2hub.com/streams/susantd), and [Talutha](http://ns2hub.com/streams/talutha).

Feel free to contact me at Chud@redditns2.com or you can PM me. I hope to get a lot of sign ups so we can have a long and fun event.

**Side note:** People with names that we find too offensive will be asked to change them since this is being streamed.

In NS2 a gorge cannot drop a resource node, cannot drop regen chamber, cannot drop cloaking chamber.  All a gorge can do is drop a hydra, and hes limited to only 3.

A commander drops almost all of the building.  Gorges are basically only good for healing and bile bomb.  How is this fun?  I used to absolutely love playing gorge in NS1.  In NS2 I find myself bored and almost useless until the late game when i can heal an Onos...and cmon that isnt the most fun thing in NS2.  Follow an Onos around and hold mouse 2....

Gorges need more abilities or to be able to drop the regen structure or cloaking structure.  Truth be told I would want gorges to be able to run stuff like they did in NS1 when you can drop resource towers or hives but thats not gonna happen.  But atleast give us some more use.

Build 204 is almost functionally identical to the build that was played at PAX East. Max stayed up all night last Thursday to add some new effects for the PAX audience, and we think you will really enjoy them.

There won't be a patch video for 204 as it is so small, and Hugh is currently working on bringing you a video of our experience at PAX East.

**Features**

* Added Alien and Marine death effects
* Added effect when a player or structure is on fire  

**SDK**

* Fixed the background in the Editor
* Made the background colors customizable in the Editor
* Fixed triangulation edges drawing for the level mesh when viewing wireframe mode in the Editor
* Fixed bug where models that were set to not cast shadows would still cast shadows in the Editor
* Fixed bug where putting an object into a hidden layer in the Editor wouldn't cause the object to hide
* Added ""Show Post Processing"" option to the viewport menu in the Editor to enable/disable bloom

Fades are reached fairly easily and early in the game. The marine counter is supposed to be shotgun technology but it doesn't seem very effective. The fades blinking is so rapid, two of them can make a mess of a group of shotgun wielding marines.

The Onos is the top tier for aliens and the flamethrower for the marines but that doesn't seem very even either.

when i first start the game up it runs fine, high and steady fps and no fps drops or nothing, only after playing for about 45 minutes it suddenly becomes unplayable, alot of random major fps drops (really major, the screen just freezes for a couple of seconds and then continues with high fps for a couple seconds, and then freezes again) and almost always fps drops when in combat.

now i searched all around the internet for solutions but nothing worked:
i tried making ns2.bat and starting it in high priority, didn't help at all
i tried turning down all graphics, didn't help at all
some people said it depended on the server you are on, but even if i stayed on the same good working server for extended period of time i get the fps drops again (simply restarting ns2 doesn't fix it either). 

can anybody please help me because i'm really enjoying this game and this is really bothering me.

This is the second of hopefully many threads to discuss things we have learned about the game recently. This could be a new strategy, a new mod you found that you think really helps, or a mechanic in the game you never knew about. I've played countless hours of NS2 and still find myself learning things almost every week! Do not be afraid to post something no matter how simple or obvious it may be. We all have more to learn and this is a great place to share it.

Here are a few more things I've discovered in the past couple of weeks:

- Mine damage does NOT stack (thanks aSecretSin) 
- In addition to bile bomb, gorge spit will also destroy a ghosted structure without returning the tres back to the marines. This may also apply for lerk spikes as well? And even parasite, although that would take FOREVER.	I know this because when commanding marines on veil, I dropped a CC blueprint in Cargo to see where the aliens were, and also deny an early hive drop. Low and behold, one gorge spit the blueprint until it disappeared, and I did not get any tres back :(
- If you attempt a shotgun rush, make sure the commander drops a second CC to be safe (why? a common counter to a shotty rush is to rush the marine start, so if the aliens destroy the starting CC, the CC blueprint might give the marines a little extra time to finish the hive)
- Another shotty rush strat I was a part of was this build order: Armory &gt; Shotguns &gt; Arms Lab &gt; Recycle the IP &gt; start Weapon 1 upgrade. When my team tried this, W1 was done just after we got to the hive. This was an all-in strat, I think the comm even came with us.
- An easy/fast way to determine the starting hive location is to drop a medpack on the other tech points. If there is a hive the health pack will stop on top of the hive, then fall through after a couple seconds.
- You can easily get into a vent by yourself if you have mines. You can jump on mines that are placed on walls, giving you that extra boost as if a marine was crouching for you.
- Apparently if you have silence, attacking a building will not alert the marines that their ""base is under attack"". Can anyone confirm this one? I just heard it last night in an argument to go silence first. 
	
	

	
These were mentioned by others in the last post, but I am unsure if they are correct:

- Opening the buy menu at an armory will heal you faster than just walking up to it
- When you build structures with a welder, it is actually faster to use the welder up until the health of the structure is full 
(what percentage this is of the total build varies by building) and then switching to the normal build tool to finish it off.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,gmarine,True,t3_1g9o33,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/1g9o33/fascinating_fridays_are_back/,

some of you might know me already, for the others I am one of the admins from the mentioned group and I am taking care of the 1.rddt.eu server.

The thing I want to talk about is the decline of the group activities and future of the server. In last month attendance of daily regulars has been dropping to the point of no played games in past 3 days. Reasons are many, to name a couple: People leaving for other games (DOTA2 looking at you, you bi...), people getting picked up by competitive teams or making their own.

We always strove for being the pub where you find teamwork and nice people. We got attention from some good people in competitive scene and they shoved us how far we have yet to go. But now it seems the road ends here, too many people lost on the way.

So what I wanted to let you know is that I'll stop doing the daily events, and if there is no games being played on the server in coming weeks I may close it down. No point in wasting money and electricity. If you are interested in jump-starting the community again I will cooperate and help you out.

**Balance**

* Changed combat time-out to 3 seconds (was 1.5) seconds (makes Regeneration and Cloaking less powerful and easy to use).
* Reduced Shade cloaking radius from 20 to 14.
* Re-balanced Crags so they now self-heal, but only give 3% health every 2 seconds (min 10, max 40). (was 5%, min 10, max 50).

**Fix**

* Fixed error when starting Explore mode.
* Fixed bug where Crags were getting too much health.
* Fixed crash when a render_setup file could not be parsed due to improper formatting.
* Fixed bug where text with multiple lines was not properly printed to the console.
* Fixed bug where the spinner on the loading screen did not display if texture quality was set to medium.

**SDK**

* Added a second parameter to the callback called from Shared.SendHTTPRequest in the case of an error, which specifies the error message.
* Changed models to use a default material if one wasn't specified in the imported file.

Gorges can't do anything against marines since spit/hydras are so terrible (especially hydras... my god those things are worthless) so they act basically as mobile healing spots for Onos and bombers against exos.  Lerks can make decent harassers/support but they are way too slow without celerity and they can't really get close to shotguns (which is 20 recoverable pres vs 30 nonrecoverable) to use half of their skills. Fades die to two well placed shot gun blasts so against marines that know what they're doing you should pretty much run from even 1 shotgun (and this is 50 pres we're talking about here...).  Of course exos can kill them even faster.  

IMO they should do something like lower lerk pres cost to 20 and increase lerk speed to celerity levels normally (so adrenaline is a better option), lower the cost of fades to maybe ~35 or give them another ~125 health, lower starting pres to 10 (so fades and lerks don't come out too quickly), buff hydras a bunch (damage + health, maybe raise/remove the limit) and spit a little (maybe faster and less energy?), and reduce onos health/raise onos cost.  Also I'd like to see umbra more often... maybe it could just require 2 hives and spores?  

Anybody else feel this way?  It seems like the only way to do anything past early game is to make sure you always have an Onos as a distraction since everything else is so pathetically squishy.  I'm getting sick to death of Onos being everywhere. It's a good thing the NS2 classic mod is coming along so well to give us back the good old lerk/fade/gorge.

With change to drifters being based on team resources, you can also send a drifter to each res node from the start of the game if you pepper the map with cysts.

This has its advantages and disadvantages in that you can see where the marines are pushing via which cysts are destroyed and immediately gain control over many resource nodes. However, you waste personal resources when you could upgrade yourself and your cyst chains could be destroyed in the middle quite easily by a pesky marine.

The marines were winning a slew of battles, and the only matches aliens were able to win were matches that ended VERY early (before marines could advance with armory bases + turrets + mines everywhere). However, with 193 it seems that mines are becoming a bit more balanced (especially with the cost being 15 now, and the set/detonation time not being immediate) and Aliens in general have been getting a few needed buffs. And I say that because now whenever I play Aliens, we don't automatically lose if the game is longer than 5 minutes and actually have a chance late game.

The late game stalemate issues are there still; even with 4/5 Hives up, Aliens still have a rough time ending the match unless there are very coordinated team attacks (which should happen but of course many people don't often communicate well in random pub matches). I think this particular game issue shouldn't be discussed all that much, seeing as Onos, Jetpack, and Exosuit are still on their way in the Gorilla patch.

Is there something I'm missing? I have the feeling I really am aiming at the skulks and when I open fire it just does 10 or 20 damage for the 25 bullets I'm firing. Needless to say it can get really frustrating to just keep on dying as a marine.

So my thought is that the com/kham (or individual marines/aliens for that matter) have an ability to designate a target for focus fire.  This would not work like it does in BF3 (where you can see the target behind cover, etc.) but it would work only when the target is in-line of sight.

If only the com could do it, then I can see it only being used by very good commanders who have excellent situational awareness. If individual players have the ability, then does it become OP?

I sort of envision a UI indicator like the scanner circle that shows up, but it could come with a voiceover prompt as well. (Khara could apply it in Alien vision or something, have the target glow brighter than a parasite-ed target maybe?).

I dont know, just thought it would be an interesting mechanic.  This was posted on the thread referencing the 3 Onos, 2 Gorge rush, and how to deal with it.  If all the players were given a target to focus fire, it may make it better (especially for us newbs) to handle hard-to-kill targets like the Onos.

Hopefully this thread can be an easy place for rookies to ask some of their questions to the community. I've looked at the [wiki](http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), but it seems to be out of date for a lot of things.

Questions:

1. Is there any way to check what you commander is researching or working on?

2. Structures seem to have two health bars, one that goes quickly and one that goes a bit more slowly. Is there any difference between these two life bars, or is it purely cosmetic?

3. When playing as marine, is there any way to bind a key to your last used weapon? I relied on quick switching to my last used weapon a lot in NS1, and it would be great here.

4. Can you ""walk"" - move silently but not crouch - as a marine? 

5. In NS1, the armor upgrades were crucial as they let you hit a few important thresholds for skulk bites. I forget it now, but I think armor 2 let you take 3 skulk focus bites instead of two. Armor 1 let you take 3 bites instead of one. What are the thresholds for marine armor in NS2 when it comes to skulks?

6. How long does fallen equipment (shotguns, welders) stay around before it is vanishes?

7. As a skulk, I can't seem to be able to parasite buildings at all. Is this still possible? Also, it seems that parasite vision has a certain range that it is active - for instance, I can't see a marine that is parasited on the other side of the map. Is that intended?

8. When I first spawn as an alien, I see the red outline of a command centre through the map (I think). Is this the marine spawn? 

9. In NS1, getting a second and third hive would automatically unlock upgrades. I know that in NS2 you need the khammander to do the research. However, is there any benefit for the aliens for having another hive until the khammander does something with it?

10. When I'm spawning as an alien, I see an egg count, something like 14 x (eggs). What does this mean?

11. How can you teleport between hives? The movement chambers (shifts?) don't seem to do that.

12. Sentry turrets seem to be much, much less effective at tracking than in NS1. Also, it seem there is a limit of 3 per factory. What are their main uses now that you can't have an autotracking sentry farm?

13. Are there ways to give orders/waypoints to specific marines as Commander?

14. Sometimes as an alien I see blue outlines of buildings, presumably something the commander has planted to be built. Can these be destroyed? I was trying to kill a blue powernode outline but it never took damage.

15. Do aliens get any advantage over marines if the marines are walking/fighting over infestation? Is there a speed advantage for aliens, or perhaps some kind of marine detection for the khammander?

16. When alien buildings are under attack, I get the announcement but I'm not able to tell where it is. In NS1, you'd see red blobs with alien sight through the map, but I don't see anything with NS2. How can I find out where the damage is being done?

17. It seems the marines have a huge advantage early, since all they need are a powernode to build a resource tower. The aliens have to branch out more slowly with cysts. Is the alien early game slower in terms of resources, or were my khammanders not the best?

I know it's a huge list, but I really appreciate the help. Coming from years of NS1, I was really hesitant about NS2, but I'm finding it great so far. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,,True,t3_158egm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/158egm/rookie_question_thread_steam_sale_edition/,

My server has capacity for two more ns2 instances, one 16 slot and one 18 slot.  A Clan is forming around our regulars and old friends so I think the 16 slot will drop to a 14 slot private for matches or custom mod/ maps... that leaves an 18 slot instance open for reddit.

I was getting frustrated and wanted to try out something new, so I switched my strategy up a bit.

Instead of going for phase tech immediately, I decided to go for Armor 1 (nothing too out of the ordinary there). For some further context, one of these games was played on Docking. We spawned in Lockers, and the aliens spawned in Generator. My very first order was to have a group of 3-4 harass Stability. While this was happening, I have the majority of the rest of the team swing down to Terminal, then go right to Departures, skipping East Wing. 

By the time my marines got to Departures, Armor 1 was up. Next we cleared the infestation and I dropped an armory, CC and a second IP. This allowed us to push from both sides without phase tech. By locking down the aliens' second hive location, I rushed a robo factory to allow for fwd sentries (specifically for the guys in stability, who were still dying periodically, but providing great pressure).  While all this is happening, I was still getting all the upgrades needed (W1, W2, shotguns, welders, etc). 

I was SO excited that I was able to win a couple games without even needing phase tech. Yes, the marines on my team at the time were relatively good, making this strat even possible. I've always been a fan of the second CC drop and an IP before phase tech, but specifically targeting the aliens' expansion hive for this is something I had yet to try out, and was pleasantly surprised in how well it worked :-)


Does anyone else have any strange/uncommon strats they have tried out while being a commander, alien or marine?


TL;DR In a couple games as commander, I've decided to go Armor 1 first but instead of getting phase tech, I rushed a second CC with an IP, specifically targeting the aliens potential second hive location. Locking down this hive location (ensuring no bile bomb) left me confident to drop a robo factory and get some fwd sentries up.

A few games in and I find myself forced into the role of commander by a group of players. I have no idea what I'm doing (labrador, lab goggles and all) and I find myself constantly asking for help. 

That's when you guys really show your colours.

The other players (who were a mix of Brits, Russians and Czechs) actually **helped** me. They told me what was what, where I should place buildings and just generally weren't being dicks to me. After about the 15th minute, we won.

When asked why the others didn't just laugh at me and refuse to help a noob, one of the Ruskies simply said ""Russian friendship, my boy"".

And that is why Natural Selection 2 is the best FPS in the world.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,onos,True,t3_160axk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/160axk/russian_friendship_and_why_you_guys_are_the_best/,

I can do aliens well enough but I just feel that because marines have to take manpower to build the rts while aliens don't aliens can get away with doing way more damage in the early game by isolating smaller groups of marines who are building rts. Should I be rushing for as many rts as possible or stay on 3? And if those rts start getting profitable, are phase gates the top priority or upgrades? I'm not getting a good sense on how the tech path should flow as marines. I get that different maps will have different priorities, but are there any general things that I should always focus on?

It was the least popular map by most. Go figure.

- Longest single vent of all ns maps, connecting half of all rooms. Popular to build large bases in.

- A room with 2 RTs close to the marine spawn, far away from all 3 hives and all other rooms and surrounded by vents

- A possible hive start right next to the marine spawn that allowerd easy rushes trough this vent. (early versions only).

- Marine Spawn being protected by an elevator and a large revolving door (early versions). Timing is key all the time.

- The two other hive locations were seperated by a long wide straight ""Tram Tunnel"" and an underwater tunnel that could not be passed without hetting healed. One team could easily defend one of these but not the other. This alone enforced timed outflanks and attacks.

- Refinery hive is such a large hall, it made onoses look small. It was possible for marines to have the RT in Refinery and still be out of siege range of the hive in the same hall.

- This map was not afraid to be different. http://www.brywright.co.uk/ns2/manual-104/ns_bast.jpg

- latest versions had big layout changes,moving ""engine room"" to the far north and making the longest vent even longer while delaying the vent ambushes a bit but making em possible everywhere: http://i.imgur.com/E4VMq.jpg

- There was one match on this map that lasted 4 hours. I played it for 3 hours with many epic stalemates and recaptures (becauser this map favours outflanks it gets funny if both teams stay in big groups all the time), switched the server for 30 minutes, came back, saw many things at the same places and some confirmed that it was still the same match.",,False,self,t5_2rfpj,False,,,True,t3_136int,http://www.reddit.com/r/ns2/comments/136int/you_will_be_missed_ns_bast/,
