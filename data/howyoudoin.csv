The series finale got me thinking. In the last episode, Ross and Rachel are intimate together for the first time since conceiving Emma. Subsequently, after a series of events, Ross and Rachel decide to get back together again (and for the long haul, according to them), Chandler and Monica move out, and the show ends. The next day I was watching reruns on TBS. In the episode, Ross mentions how he and Rachel did it 298 times when they were going out. I then pieced together that their 299th time together they made Emma, and the 300th time they decided to really commit to eachother.

tl;dr you have to have sex with someone 300 times to truly fall in love with them (well, at least according to Ross and Rachel)",,False,self,t5_2tqcj,False,,,True,t3_1jh1wy,http://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/1jh1wy/something_interesting_i_figured_out_while/,

My opinion: Ross/Phoebe,VikramMookerjee,78,12,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/184rc7/whats_the_most_underrated_friends_relationship_my/,"Everyone's all about the other relationships, like Chandler/Monica, Chandler/Joey, Ross/Rachel, Phoebe/Joey, but when I watch the series from the start to end, I notice a really underrated relationship between Ross and Phoebe. They were never romantic (except in the one with the flashback). 

They frequently had their differences (Phoebe not believing in evolution, Ross telling Mike that Phoebe had never been in a long term relationship, etc) and yet they were always there for each other when times got tough, just like in the theme song. Phoebe is the first one to console Ross after he finds out his wife is a lesbian. Phoebe is almost always the one pushing Ross to be with Rachel (masterminding the plan where Ross gets stood up and Rachel goes on a horrible date, convincing Ross to pursue things with Rachel in the hospital after Rachel gives birth to Emma, Phoebe drives Ross to the airport to meet Rachel etc). Furthermore, the on-screen chemistry between David Schwimmer and Lisa Kudrow is awesome. Some of their scenes are the funniest in the entire show in my opinion (ROOOOSSSSSS CAAAAAAN).

Finally santa asked me what I wanted for Christmas. So I told him I wanted Friends. Nothing else, just the word friends. Everybody in line let out an aww of pity as I walked off the stage.

",__CanExplainThat,58,17,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/16c05d/at_the_end_ross_couldve_gone_to_paris_he_has/,"That apartment is worth holding on to.  The rent is supposed to be cheap because of rent control in Nana's name.  Ross just got tenure, so it wouldn't slow down his career that much to spend a few years abroad in Paris - and since it's academia, I imagine his not speaking French wouldn't hurt him that much.  I mean Rachel is going and she only speaks in English, and she's in business.  As a tenured professor in his 30's, Ross is comparatively a star in his field, and could probably even do part-time work at both NYU and Paris if he wanted to, giving more incentive to keep that apartment.  In TOW Estelle Dies, we're told that LV was going to give Rachel really good terms, like paying for all flights for her, Ross and Emma between NYC and Paris.  It's not told whether they would've paid for her apartment in Paris, but that would give even more reason for Ross to take Monica's place.  

Just throwing it out there, since we're told that Ross got tenure - he might as well take advantage of that and let Rachel go to Paris once they decided to be together, and he could've followed her to Paris.

To say it's good is an understatement imo. Leblanc is great in it, and the rest of the cast is good as well, especially the writer couple who most of the story revolves around, they're adorably British as opposed to too British. 

There are many Friends references both subtle and overt. I don't see how a fan of Friends wouldn't enjoy Episodes, so however you get your tv shows i highly recommend acquiring it. 

My only complaint is there's so few episodes of it. 7 in the first season, 9 in the second, but the trade off is practically every scene is good.

1. Carol's character as a pregnant ex-wife makes her first on-screen appearance in episode 102, in 1994.  Not only does the issue of marriage equality come up when Carol and Susan get ""married"" later, but right from episode 102, the topic of a same-sex couple raising a child is explicitly mentioned (during the Gellers' family dinner).  Friends was pretty pioneering.  

2. That said, all-in-all, Ross got the short of the stick.  During the whole 1st season and some of the other earlier ones, the show seemed to make a big deal about Ross becoming a father.  But to be honest, it doesn't seem like he has that much responsibility... (except providing a male parent-figure, which if you think is important, actually negates a bit of the ""same-sex couples can raise children as well as straight couples"" argument.) 

3. What are the legal rights to Ben like?  First Carol, because she's the mother.  Then Ross,because he's the biological father.  Then Carol adds Susan as a legal guardian?  If Carol dies or is no longer able to care for Ben, who would get him first, Ross or Susan?  In the ""Friends world,"" it would seem to be Susan, but legally, does Carol have the right to assign Susan a higher ""guardian rank"" than Ross?  It would seem that unless Carol can do something like that, legally it would go to Ross and Susan would get fucked.  

4. Do you guys think Ross pays alimony to Carol? 

5. What if Susan was a guy?  Relations between Ross and Carol would have been worse.  Do you think the Ross and Ben relationship would have been different in any way at all?

That's what we really need guys. Unseen blooper footage, more behind the scenes stuff, cast and crew talking about it, maybe even accounts of how the show changed people's lives, changed sit-comedy, changed the course of television. 

This solution would satisfy the fans who crave more Friends, but it wouldn't risk the integrity of the show's legacy (which I've always assumed to be the reason they haven't done a reunion movie or series). It would go deeper than that, it would answer all the unanswered questions, it would illustrate the love we (the fans) feel for the show and its characters. 

I feel like we can make this happen, r/howyoudoin. Let's start writing letters to David crane and Marta Kauffman. This documentary needs to happen.

What do Friends do you ask? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

Whoever has the most friends by the end of the quiz wins! (maybe a mod can give you certain flair or something)

LETS BEGIN.

(questions are in comments)

I will put the questions up here as well so if you want to do the quiz without seeing the answers you can!

Q. What is Chandler Bing's Job?

Q. What are the Names of Frank and Alice's Children?

Q. Why does Ross go to Montreal?

Q. What are the phases of breaking up?

Q. What was the final inspiration for Ross hooking up with the Xerox girl?

Q. How did everyone individually find out about Chandler and Monica? (must have all 4 answers)

Q. Who is Hilda?

Q. When does Ross realize he's ready to be a father?

Q. What are all the items on the infamous ""list""?

Q. Who pees on Monica? Why?

** Update **

There are a few questions still left unanswered! So far it's a tie between therasim and spontaneosaur with 5 Friends! (spontaneosaur answered the bonus question in the comments)

AND THE QUIZ IS OVER!

1st Place: therasim (he/she tied with spontaneosaur but answered more questions so he/she gets first) +5

2nd Place: spontaneosaur +5

3rd Place: regularcelery +3 (potentially +4 if he/she answers the last question)

Honorable mentions: orabrooch and Tinkerboots

So It's really my favourite series.
But yesterday I rewatched ***The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs*** and I really started to get pissed of by how they react when Chandler told them that he ""hates"" Dogs. It's clear (he even says it) that he is afraid of them. And all they do is make fun of him. As a child I was really freaking scared of dogs and I'm still awared around them. So I can't understand why they don't accept it? Even hin own Wife doesn't stand by his side? Ugh..
Maybe someone has a good explaination on this one!?
I think the rest of the story in this episode is really hilarious so this bothers me even more.

But... even if Richard did sleep with other woman, he can't tell Monica!  Richard is Monica's father's best friend, so Mr. Geller and that circle of people (the parents, I guess?) know that Richard has only dated Barbara and Monica.  If Richard said more than 2, this would expose that he has cheated on Barbara (unless he slipped someone in between Barbara and Monica).  So we can't trust his answer.
