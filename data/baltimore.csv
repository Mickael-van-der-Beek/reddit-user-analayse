1367292011.0,924,self.baltimore,1ddywz,Throwaway time... Have you ever been in the Baltimore Detention Center? What was it like? Maybe NSFW,detainedinbmore,1197,273,1341,http://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1ddywz/throwaway_time_have_you_ever_been_in_the/,"I won't post anything about why I was in there, but I will detail what it was like as a typical redditor (white, nerdy, mid-twenties.) I will say that my crime was very trivial.

It's incredibly boring with bursts of extreme fear. Everyone in there just talks about crime, how they didn't do it, or how to do it without getting caught. 80% of the population is black. Almost everyone I encountered was cool, with exception to a few individuals...

When I was initially in holding (where you go after they take your stuff and get you to fill out paperwork) a skinny white guy with face tattoos was explaining how I should handle inquiries about my gang affiliation. He said I should associate with the whiteboy gang... alright. After that I got moved into a larger (think 10'x10') cement room with 8-9 other people. It was around 4-5am I'd say at this point, everyone was snoring, farting, tossing and turning trying to get comfortable on the cement slabs that you had to sleep on. The lights never turn off in this area... And there are always yells, buzzers, or chatter outside of the cell, which had a big glass window. Some dudes were calling me names, so I acted like I was asleep... I didn't want to get into a jail fight lol...

After what seemed like forever, but in reality was maybe 12 hours, I got my very own jumpsuit. They make you spread you balls, crotch, and cough naked... You know, just in-case I had some heroin and a cellphone in my ass... It's degrading. Here's when you finally get that one phone call. If you're like me, and use a cellphone which stores all of your freinds/families numbers, you could easily be fucked. It doesn't help that right behind you people are bitching about you taking too much time. It's definitely interesting to ease-drop on other peoples calls... About how they screwed up again and need to make bail again... or brag about their crime, and how they didn't snitch, like this 18 year old kid was doing next to me.

My story is probably a little different from here on out, because the center was so full that they just put me and 8-9 other guys in another holding cell for the next day. 

The cell was around 12'x12', all cement, and lights on all the time. This cell however had a toilet with two 2' walls on either side. Crafty prisoners will hold up a shirt and they take a dump in the presence of everyone else. Fortunately I wasn't filled up by the jail food, which consisted of a really terrible lunchmeat sandwich, a plastic bag of juice, and a cookie. Everything was stale, and contained no nutritional value... I wasn't in the place to complain though.

As for the people I spent this time with, they would eventually begin to tell their stories. It was fascinating to hear a completely different side of life than I had ever been exposed to. One guy was pretty normal, likable, and told everyone willing to listen about how he was simply walking around in his neighborhood, helping his brother move when the cops caught him with heroin. 

Another dude was apparently some kind of bounty hunter that was wanted on multiple warrents... Fortunately he was really relaxed. 

There was another guy on $500,000 bail (mine was $3,000) who I spent time with, he had some kind of crazy gun charges, assaulting the police, and other crimes. Another guy was losing his mind, and being extremely hostile to anyone who looked at him the wrong way. He would think he recognized people who stole from him on the streets, and begin to start fights with them. Then he told me how 92Q had a conspiracy to kill him. 

The other inmates would taunt and flirt with the C/O's, who were surprisingly a bunch of obese black women. I say it's surprising because I couldn't imagine them restraining some of the men in the jail... One of them actually assaulted a guard and they all beat him with those night stick things in front of the holding cells.

Fortunately I got out not too long after that. All-in-all I didn't join the general population, thankfully. But I did see Baltimore from a very depressing and terrible perspective. I saw how the detention center was like a big factory, with a very defined process. The crazy thing was that a lot of people I encountered seemed to just kind of shrug at it, like it was part of their life. They knew they would be back after they got out.

I got out later at night, and was able to walk back to my apartment. Which was a little unnerving, because I never quite grasped how close we all live to the detention center until that moment.

Reddit, let's hear your story. 

EDIT: As for the visuals, it's interesting. People smuggle in or steal ballpoint pens, and there's gang tags all over the place. There's also dates, some from the 1980's from former prisoners, and sometimes RIP's. The gang tags are unlike any cryptic language I've seen before though, it's a lot of Illuminati style symbols, like pyramids and eyes. By the phones, and even in the holding cells people will scribble down the numbers of bail-bonds places. That's actually who I called when I had my one phonecall. 

EDIT: Woh, this thread is way more popular than I expected! Post more stories!

While everyone was following Petraeus and Twinkies, some important shit was going on and none of it got the respect it deserved.

Just a few hours ago members of the SWAT team were called in to [remove homeless advocates from a rally](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/breaking/bs-md-ci-homeless-sleep-out-20121114,0,148396.story) to support the homeless as well as provide them with food, warm clothes and blankets.

Thanks again everybody for all the helpful suggestions and support. So the good news is that that police have been able to identify and arrest 7 of the 8 culprits and all have confessed to the crime. In addition, the police were able to recover my kindle. The bad news is that my laptop was sold on the street for $20 (it was 2 months old and $600) and my iPhone was sold on the street for what I'm assuming to be a similarly absurdly low price. Overall, I can't stress enough how helpful and responsive the MTA police have been and it definitely renews my faith in public services. I can provide another update once the whole court process takes care of itself if anybody is interested.

Could you please upvote this post so more people see it.  i dont get karma from a self post.  I had 2 bikes stolen from my garage this morning.  They were both treks.  

First one was a trek mountain bike in flat black.  Black everything.  Had a water bottle cage and a pump on it.  it was a model 3700.

Second one was a trek trail bike.  Taller.  I think 54cm.  tan and green with a black saddle.  front fork had shocks.  it was a trek multitrack 7400.

they were taken from my garage sometime this morning.  I live just north of union memorial hospital.  so my best guess is someone from govens or waverly.  if you live around this area, travel this area, browse craigslist, etc, help me out please.  If you see them, call the police with their location.  they have been reported stolen so the police will know where to bring them.  if you could also let me know, that would be great.

Thank you guys so much in advance",,False,self,t5_2qipq,False,,,True,t3_1gutym,http://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1gutym/stolen_bike_help/,

&gt;Question 6 is a Maryland state referendum filed to challenge the law that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. The Civil Marriage Protection Act, approved in 2012, would allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license, protect clergy from having to perform any particular marriage ceremony in violation of their religious beliefs, and affirm that each religious faith has exclusive control over its own theological doctrine regarding who may marry within that faith, effective January 1, 2013. The referendum will ask voters in the state to vote ""For"" or ""Against"" the law and will be held November 6, 2012 during the state general election. -- [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Question_6_%282012%29), from Wikipedia

Per [Spot The Station](http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/), the International Space Station will be passing over Baltimore at 9:33pm E**D**T tonight.  The station will appear from SSW and head to ENE.  It will be visible for about 6 minutes or so in the area.

**EDIT:** As *thom612* pointed out, my title was inaccurate, I should have said EDT. The station will be visible at 9:33 Baltimore local time. 

Look for the unnaturally bright star that isn't twinkling, moving surprisingly fast across the sky.  Its bright enough to be seen in the midst of the city's street lights and if this currently cloudless sky holds there should be fantastic conditions to see it very well.

Usually when the station passes over this area its either the middle of the day or so ridiculously late (early?) as to make viewing impossible.  If you've never seen it, I highly recommend you take a look tonight.

First, thanks for all your suggestions earlier for vacation ideas and crab restaurant suggestions. 

My wife and I both though it was crazy-neat. We get out of the car, unload the stroller and start walking down the street and people are actually SAYING, ""Hello!"" ""Good morning!"" How are ya?""  Like they mean it! I shook hands with at least two strangers! In Michigan, we may nod with a smile, but here you all actually talk to each other. Its awesome and refreshing. Best was that I did a spontaneous duet with a complete stranger in Fells Point to Modest Mouse's ""Float On."" She was just eating at this restaurant at a table outside--it came on the speakers and we both starting singing. My son thought that was hilarious. What a moment.

We hit up Fells Point, That little market on Broadway, then over to Ellicott City--WHICH WAS BEAUTIFUL. Arundel Mills Mall (cause daddy needed to go to a Lego store after that shop in Ellicott) Then down to Lexington Market--which was a bit scary--so scary I forgot the crab place I was going to try there. And then back to our hotel. 

A good day, and thanks for the help figuring things out!

There's so many wonderful and terrible and even mediocre memories I have from this place. Chances are good I won't live here forever, but I think deep down I'll always consider Baltimore home. Just a few things:

* Got hit by a car on St. Paul St. a few years ago, and severely injured. If I hadn't been a 5 minute ambulance ride from the best shock trauma center in the country, I'd either be dead or crippled now.

* Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The Orioles suck, I don't even like baseball, but this place is so terrific that I still enjoy going to games there.

* The Ravens. Can't imagine ever being a serious fan of any other NFL team since I drank the purple koolaid.

* Natty Boh. So cheap, so refreshing, so reliable a way to get drunk even when you're broke as a joke. Even though it's not brewed here anymore, it's still the beer of choice for Baltimorons, and that suits me just fine.

* The [Baltimore Free Farm](http://www.baltimorefreefarm.org/). That project is such an inspiration.

Jolene is a wonderful ~16 month old Pit/terrier (possibly pocket pit). I met Jolene while on duty on a mundane afternoon this past April. When I met Jolene she was cowering in the back of a Baltimore City Animal Control van incredibly under weight and fighting a pretty nasty bout of pneumonia. Talking to the Animal Control Agent I found that Jolene needed a lot of attention on her road to recovery, more than an already exhausted Barcs shelter could afford. I made the decision immediately that I would make this precious girl whole again. 

 Well I'm proud to say that a few months, a few dollars and a heap of sleepless nights, Jolene is a pinnacle example of what a bit of shared love can do for a suffering stray. She's gone from hiding under chairs at the office afraid of her own shadow to eagerly greeting anyone willing to put up with a bit of slobbery kisses. 

 Sadly this brings me to my reason of speaking with you today. I have discovered that the life of a Baltimore City Police officer is just not fair for this gentle princess. Jolene does not need a ton of attention and is quite capable of entertaining herself for a great length of time, given enough room to stretch her legs and get a good run in. All she asks for is a belly rub and a lap to lay her head on. It's with great pain that I have to admit that this is where I have failed her. With my constantly rotating shift and regular shortages leading to being forced to work doubles regularly, I simply can't offer her the time and attention she deserves. 

 I know pits have an attached stigma to them but I can not be more sincere when I say this is the absolute sweetest thing I've ever had the pleasure of rolling around in the grass with. So with this being said if anyone can assist is connecting me with someone interested making her a part of their family or maybe a program who can assist, I would be forever in gratitude. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions that may help is this venture. Thank you for your time.

Last night there was a car accident in Fells Point in which two teenagers died, one of which was a friend of mine Zoey Crumpton who I've known since middle school. The sun wrote an [article](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-fatal-accident-20111021,0,770258.story) about the accident which focuses almost entirely on the other kid (regardless of the fact that accident was his fault) and its killing me a little bit that they're ignoring because this kid had so many accomplishments. I just wanted to take a little space here to say that she was an amazing person who had me practically peeing my pants laughing since the day I met her. She might not have been homecoming queen or have been changing young lives but she made my life so much better and brighter and she deserves to be remembered.

Much of the social media based commentary frames the issues as how is the *city government* going to fix this. Therein lies the crux of the issue. Significant change won’t come from the top, *you* need to be the champion for your issues. 

Here are some ways you can actually influence what is happening in your city right now:

1 - [Register to vote](http://elections.state.md.us/voter_registration/index.html) and then actually go to the polls for the **local** elections.

Only [72,849](http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/BoardsandCommissions/ElectionsBoard/PastElectionResults.aspx) people voted in the last mayoral primary, and right now, primaries are a big deal in this city, since only [46,814](http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/BoardsandCommissions/ElectionsBoard/PastElectionResults.aspx) votes were cast in the 2011 mayoral general election. Your vote does make a difference. 

&gt; 

2 - Find your neighborhood’s website/Facebook/Twitter/Nextdoor.

You can easily read up on what events are happening in your area and then go meet your neighbors. You are all likely to be dealing with the same issues. 

&gt; 

3 - Go to a community meeting. 

LiveBaltimore has a list of neighborhoods and [many of the profiles](http://www.livebaltimore.com/neighborhoods/list/) include information on how to contact your community leaders. Your community association want to hear from you, they want to know what you love and hate about the neighborhood, and the only way anything will change is if you put the idea out there. 

&gt; 

3b - If none of those resources exist for you, start your own. 

Set up a [Nextdoor](http://nextdoor.com), Facebook, Twitter, Meetup, or hold a real block party. [Greater Homewood Community Corporation](http://www.greaterhomewood.org/) assists people and organizatins with community initiatives, although their focus is the north portion of the city.

Cutest thing to ever walk the Earth.

We decided to take advantage of the whole Aquarium/Science Center being only $1 thing. We parked a little farther up by Fayette and Baltimore St. and walked down to the Harbor. 

As we were passing the Gallery (mall) these two younger black kids, no older than 22? Were on the verge of a nasty fight. One dropped his bags and threw up his fists and the other pulled his hand back for a punch and used his other hand to grab his collar and shake him up. This happened about 5 feet in front of us as we were about to pass them walking on the sidewalk. We were both holding the little girls' opposite hands and we just were stunned and immediately were pulling her back, in fear of her being hurt. Just then, an older black gentleman, who may or may not have known them, with a stern, loud voice shouted, ""**Not in front of the GOD DAMN child.**"" And they immediately froze and let us walk by.

I guess I'm sharing the story because I've never encountered anything like this. I've seen countless fights in Baltimore, I'm not from the county, I'm ten minutes from the harbor. But I guess I'm saying, I really was amazed at this man's watching over our little girl as if she were his own and I wish I could see more of it in Baltimore.

Baltimore can be a really cool place sometimes..

I have not been having the greatest December, or the greatest  2012, but that's a story for another day.  In the past two weeks I have made two careless mistakes and have been blown away by the acts of kindness from complete strangers.  We always hear about the bad stories about life and rarely get to hear about the good ones, so I figured I would share mine.

Last week I carelessly dropped my wallet outside of my car in Fells Point and didnt realize that I had dropped it.  When I went searching for it about an hour later I discovered a note on my windshield to call ""James"" and he would return my wallet.  Not only did he return my wallet, he returned it complete with all my cash and credit cards.  I was so surprised that I didnt know what an appropriate reward would be, so I gave him a small reward and thanked him for his kindness.  

Last night after I got home from work I accidentally left my interior light on in my car.  When I went to go to work today I was stuck with a dead battery and a set of jumper cables.  Unfortunately I dont have many close friends in Baltimore, so I proceeded to raise my hood and look for a good Samaritan.  Within a few minutes a man whose name I didnt get (Anon) stopped and attempted to jump my car.  He gave up ten minutes of his personal time before giving up (we couldnt get it started).  Although I was disappointed, I still needed to get my car started.  Within about another twenty minutes another person, Drew, stopped to offer his assistance.  He gave up thirty minutes of his day to charge my batter to start my car.  I was absolutely amazed that all these people stopped to help a complete stranger in need.

I'm generally self-reliant, but this month I needed some help.  These three strangers helped me more than I would have ever expected and I plan on paying it forward as often as I can.  I just wanted to recognize these three random strangers that amazed me with their kindness and honesty, they saved my December.

Thank you James, Drew, and Anon(I wish I got your name)

I am entering my last semester of dental hygiene school, and I need patients like you would not believe. I will give you the best, most thorough cleaning of your life, and it only costs $20. I can take x-rays if you are due for them as well, and they only cost $5-25 depending on what you may need ($5 is most common). My school is located in Dundalk, and appointments are about 3 hours long. They are long because we do many preliminary assessments and our faculty checks our work very carefully. I have appointments on Monday and Friday afternoons, from 1:15-4:30 and Wednesday mornings from 8:15-11:30.

I specifically need patients who haven't had a cleaning in a long time, patients who smoke, those who don't brush or floss everyday, etc. It is my last semester so the dirtier your teeth are, the better it is for me. But all are welcome. This is a great service, especially if you don't have dental insurance.

We have a DDS on site who will come over and take a look at your teeth and diagnose any cavities or things that may need treatment. We don't do restorative work at my school, so this will be a very professional, unbiased opinion.

I have worked on several redditors in the past, and I have to say you guys are my favorite patients. Having a  patient in my chair everyday is how I earn my grade, and I get deducted if I don't have a patient (even if they cancel last minute). So come on out, support your local dental hygiene student, and help me help you! 

Email me at lexideck@gmail.com and we can set something up!

I moved here from Indiana (by way of North Carolina) after I accepted a great job. But, 4 years in, I'm still struggling to like living in Baltimore. I didn't have any preconceived notions about Baltimore before moving here other than what I had seen in John Waters' films, whom I LOVE. But, I can't look back on the last few years and find too many positive moments. 
Literally the first night I moved into my new apartment there was a double shooting in the unit next door and since then there have been 5 more shootings in my area (no one injured but the Police came). I've found that the cost of living (rent, food, etc.) is far too expensive for what you actually get, most of the people I meet are rude or won't talk to me at all, traffic is HORRIBLE and public transportation is a joke, and I feel very restricted to certain parts of the city due to problems with crime. For this last reason, Baltimore has actually become a very small place to live.

Baltimoreans, please help me! I live here, I work here, and I'll be here for a long time to come (whether I like it or not). What am I missing about Baltimore? Where can I find joy in this city?   

TL:DR I'm starting to despise the city and I don't want to. Please help me get out of this funk. Tell me the great things about Baltimore that I am apparently missing.

Edit: It looks like I am going ahead with this. I made a [Baltimore Redditor Meetup Yahoo! group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bmore_reddit) for us. I figure that will be the easiest way to stay in contact with everyone. I am going to PM everyone who has responded prior to this edit with the web address. 

Edit Edit: A few of you asked why I have made the Yahoo! group since this functions in a similar manner. I just figured it would be easier to message everyone as a whole rather than relying on people to check back here for updated information. I will also post updates here or in another post on /r/baltimore.

I rent a basement studio apartment and have been there for almost a year. Since then, every experience with their leasing office and corporate office has been horrible.

My apartment sits in the side of a hill and apparently there are cracks in the foundation. I found out when Sandy hit because I had 4 inches of water in my apartment in the course of a couple hours. I found out from the maintenance office that the apartment had flooded before I moved in and they opted not to pay to have the problem fixed. Since then, it's flooded 3 other times and they do the bare minimum to make the apartment habitable each time.

The people at the corporate office are the really shady ones. Each time the apartment floods, they promise to credit my rent for the time displaced and then go back on their promise after the fact. They've nit picked with me about the number of days displaced and told me the apartment was habitable even when the carpets were still wet. 

The flooding is the most egregious episode but they've been fucked up in other ways. When I moved in they promised I didn't have to sign a pet addendum and when the corporate office found out a couple months ago tried to go back on the verbal agreement. 

They use an awful towing company that has towed my car twice for having expired tags. The first time I was waiting for the stickers to come in the mail. The second time they just ignored the sign in the window verifying my temporary registration. They also purposely tow in the middle of the night so you can't catch them. When I brought it to the leasing office they said it was beyond their control even though they are the ones that contract the towing company.

At this point, they stopped bothering to fix my carpet or replace the water damaged doors in my apartment. They won't even answer my requests to deal with the mold or put in a dehumidifier. 

I know this was a rant but my original intention was to warn anyone else from making the same mistake I did. The apartment next to mine floods as well and they are actively trying to rent it out again. I'm working on having the city condemn the building and I'm moving into a house next month so I'll be done with this nightmare soon. However, they will continue to be shitty slumlords.

We covered an intro to flux welding.  I just want to say it was a great time.  Andrew and Corey who run the show are really great guys.  Very helpful, very friendly, and definitely excited about putting together a maker's space in Baltimore.  All the people I met were nice and this is absolutely something you should check out.  They're going to be offering more classes on other stuff.  Corey specifically mentioned a robotics class (think Arduino microcontrollers etc) and they're putting together a anodizing class as well.  They also mentioned a possible sand casting class (think molten aluminum in casts).  Simply put, this is two smart nerdy guys doing awesome nerdy shit.  It was a lot of fun and a neat new skill to learn.  Keep your eye on it for the future.  They're just starting off so I think the more people they get interested the likelier it is they will become a staple in Baltimore.

*""The archival collection that is most used at the Baltimore Museum of Industry is the BGE Collection, which consists of approximately 250,000 photographs and negatives from BGE.
These images were taken as part of that company’s daily operations, and capture Baltimore’s workplaces, cityscapes, and life in Baltimore from the late 1800s through the 1980s.*  
  
*These pictures of Baltimore and the surrounding region show the changing commercial, cultural, and physical landscape of the region.
With the generous support of Excelon (previously as Constellation Energy and as BGE), BMI is working to digitize and preserve this valuable historic resource. While this project is ongoing, the digital database now contains about 10,000 photographs able to be viewed online.""*

This evening I ran out of gas on 695 and walked up a ramp to the closest open building. On foot, I stopped at the Lexus dealership to ask where I could find closest station. The 2 gentlemen inquired about my situation and immediately checked a closet for a gas can. Finding that there was gas in it, the younger gentlemen was told to take me to my car and use however much was needed.

My next door neighbor and her husband are both retired, but she is suffering from dementia, which seems to be getting progressively worse.  Her husband is a great guy, but I'm not sure he has adequate resources to be able to put her into a home or somewhere she can receive appropriate care.  I've talked to him many times, and I know she's on a lot of meds which for the most part make her manageable but otherwise a zombie.  I'm not sure on the particulars, but I believe there are times - generally at night - when her meds have worn off but she can't have more.  This is when she can become quite aggressive and belligerent.  We live in adjacent rowhomes, so it is quite obvious when this happens, and loud.  Last night for example, she banged, stomped, slammed, etc. from around 8pm to around midnight.  This happens all over the house.  It keeps my wife and I up, and wakes up my two year old, who is then usually scared due to the loud banging and yelling.

I have called the police on her once before when I saw her out in the street repeatedly kicking parked cars and trying to hit passing cars with a remote control, but this was basically out of concern for her personal safety.  

I am hoping somebody has some good advice, or better yet, knows of a better way this whole situation could be handled for the benefit of her, her husband, and my family.

Be on the lookout,nghtfx,47,6,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/ho3js/mugged_in_charles_village_tonight_be_on_the/,"I had 2 guys attempt to mug me and steal my moped tonight on Calvert and 29th. They didn't succeed, but did get away. The descriptions I can offer are pretty useless (6ft african american male, skinny. 5'9 african american male, fat) but let this be a warning to anyone in the area. The skinny dude was scouting the area earlier in the day on a bike, and noticed our mopeds. He tried to pull one away then saw it was double-locked up to a post. I figure at this point he went back and told his gravitationally blessed friend to get a hack-saw and head over to attempt to steal it. 

This is where we got lucky. My friends and I had just left the house, and had put on our helmets and gear to ride back home. We started up all 3 mopeds before the guys rolled around near us and said ""Headin' out, yeeaaaa?"" I laughed and shrugged it off, 'cause people say dumb things to moped riders all the time. Not two seconds later, the skinny guy grabbed me from behind and pulled me off the moped, promptly grabbing it and attempting to run away. Little did he know, the fall bent the rear fender around the back wheel, jamming it in place. The moped wasn't rolling anywhere.

I hopped up fast as lightning, and without a single thought running through my head, I started throwing punches. A few right hooks and a choke hold and the fight ended up on the ground. I continued to punch him in the face as much as possible, but he ended up wiggling free (drugs are crazy). While I was getting up, he grabbed the moped again, but luckily my other friend had turned around and saw what was going on. She ended up pushing the guy and breaking him free from the bike, giving me a perfect opportunity to continue the meet &amp; greet with my fists. 

He dodged the first swing, just barely, and spun around to deliver a half assed punch of his own. Normally, this could be bad... except I was wearing a full-faced motorcycle helmet. Not a thing was felt. Sorry. 

I landed another punch or two before he jumped back, and reached for his belt.

* Him:*I gotta knife bro, I gotta knife*
* Me:**So do I, mother fucker**

He saw me grab my blade from my pocket and begin to open it, then took off running. 

Then, I saw something that'll never leave my mind. His accomplice, (Approximately 5'9"", 450lbs) ~~running~~ hobbling towards me with a **hack-saw**. I turned to him at this point, and pulled my knife out (blade was still folded). I've never seen a fat man run so fast in my life, especially with his pants halfway down his legs. 

I made the mistake of not chasing these idiots, but instead found a JHU Campus police officer who promptly contacted Baltimore City police. I rode around in a car for about 15 minutes looking for them, but no luck.

Let this be a warning to everyone in the Charles Village area and surrounding. Keep your bikes locked up, and don't use cable locks. Be on the lookout for people scouting bikes/mopeds/scooters ect!

TL:DR; Attempted mugging, kids got away after getting punched a lot, fat kid ran scared with a hack-saw and his pants half down

It's a non-profit residential treatment program that helps veterans and others break the cycle of poverty, drug addiction and homelessness in Baltimore.

This month, they're up against 3 other non-profit organizations across the U.S. and if they get the most votes - Home Depot will award them $25,0000 which will help the organization perform much needed repairs and upgrades to their two facilities in the city.

Right now, The Baltimore Station is neck-and-neck with a NY based organization and, it's one of those vote once a day things on Facebook, but even if you don't come back to vote everyday - a good boost from Baltimore Redditors can help them get the push they need to start the month out right.

Please take a few seconds to go to the voting page and vote for The Baltimore Station and let's keep the winning streak in Baltimore alive!

1. Please, please, obey traffic signals. If there is a red light, don't just assume that you can run though it and have the cross traffic see you. It's dangerous enough to do during the day, it's insanely dangerous at night. 

2. For the love of god, don't wear black clothing. It's hard enough to see you guys during the day since you take up such a small space, but when you're wearing black or even just dark colored clothing at night, you're like little ninja's popping out of the void. 

3. Wear some sort of lighting. When navigating at night, the best way to signal your presence is with some sort of light. It really doesn't matter what type, or how dorky you look. Having some way to signal to the vehicles around you that you are there is infinitely better than being run into with a car.

I had visited D.C. plenty, but I don't think you can ever really get a feel for the place until you live there.  I live in a nice, clean part of D.C. (on the MD side, of course)

On paper, D.C. is better than Baltimore in every way (except for their respective football teams).  Public transit is better, the economy is better, the standard of living is better, there are more restaurants and museums ... but after living here a little less than a year, I think Baltimore is such a better city.  I always made fun of Baltimore's nickname ""Charm City"" until recently.  I've really come to understand it.  

Everyone in D.C. sucks.  They're rude, entitled narcissists who don't know how to drive or use a damn crosswalk.  Almost every morning on the news here there's a story about a pedestrian or bicyclist getting creamed by a car, and I really think it's because so many pedestrians here are so wrapped up in their own little worlds that they don't notice where they're walking.

You expect the power-walking, power-suiting type-A-types to be rude and condescending.  What you don't expect is every cashier, every retail employee, every waiter to be equally rude and condescending.

The other thing that bothers me is that, if you want to live by a metro, which you almost have to because commuting by car is impossible, you either have to pay a really high rent, or live in the ghetto.  There's not a lot of ""in-between"" like there is in Baltimore.  

They also have no respect for crabcakes.  They put freakin avacado in them or some kind of nasty orange dressing.

I come back home whenever I get a chance.  With gas prices rising, it's tough.  The prospect of having to stay here, because most of the jobs I really want are here in D.C., is worrying.

I will start with a few of my favorites:

Mexican: [Taqueria el Sabor del Parque](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-el-sabor-del-parque-baltimore).  I will take this any day over Tortilleria Sinaloa, which by the way, is not too shabby itself.  If you want tex mex you will be disappointed (one of the reviewers returned their carnitas and gave this place 1 star because they were served traditional carnitas, which is deep fried pork shoulder, instead of shredded pork, which is in no way carnitas).  This place is cheep, delicious, simple, and pretty much what you get in many latin american countries.

Jamaican: [Judy's Island Grill and Bakehouse](http://www.judysislandgrill.net/)  I've only been a few times, but their goat curry is the real deal.  Beef paties aren't as good as I was hoping (if anyone has a go to spot for them please help), but the curry damn near brings me to tears.  WARNING:  dress messy, don't pull out fancy phones, and don't bring a lot of cash.  This place is not in a good neighborhood, but if your not an asshole or an idiot you shouldn't have any problems.

Ethiopian: [Dukem](http://dukemrestaurant.com/)  Good simple Ethiopian food, which if you have never had, is an experience, and quite wonderful.

Korean: I can't seem to find the name of or, or the fact that it exists on the internet but it is at the intersection of 21st and Maryland on the north east corner.  Wonderful hot pots, and traditional Korean food for relatively cheap. As for Korean BBQ my favorite place is [Joung Kak](http://www.yelp.com/biz/jong-kak-baltimore-3), but the best Korean BBQ, or even the merits of the BBQ over other Korean food is hugely debated amongst food obsessed Baltimoreans.",,False,self,t5_2qipq,False,,,True,t3_18brp6,http://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/18brp6/best_authentic_and_wonderfuly_delicious_ethnic/,
