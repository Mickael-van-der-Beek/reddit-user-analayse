Drivers making wrong claims about supported functionality is worse for application developers than not implementing the extension at all, because programs will end up relying on broken functionality.

I was annoyed with most resources using deprecated functionality and most of the sources being in tutorial form. Often the tutorials wrap away functionality in a framework (which imho gets in the way of actually learning OpenGL) and focus on doing stuff with OpenGL instead of actual OpenGL functionality. As a result its very hard to actally find clean examples for more advanced features like instancing, geometry shaders, transform feedback, uniform buffers etc.

So I set out to provide such a collection. All the examples are self contained in a single file up to some ""canonical libraries"" (glew, glfw, glm). The idea of them being self contained and minimalistic is that they should give a quick testbed for messing around with the more advanced OGL functionality and also to have a sort of minimal example in addition to reading the raw specs (which at least I usually end up doing when trying to learn about these features).

The examples can be found on github: https://github.com/progschj/OpenGL-Examples

I'm currently working on yet another OpenGL guide, but there are a few things I want to do differently.

- Coverage of modern topics like geometry shaders and feedback buffers
- Choice of libraries to use instead of forcing one (e.g. GLUT)
- Emphasis on real world uses of features (by developing a voxel world renderer throughout the tutorial series)
- Providing exercises to get the reader involved and to build up a real understanding
- Everyone can submit improvements, but with more quality control than a wiki
- On-site feedback and help

My aim is really to make it fun for people new to OpenGL to learn how to use it in a non-deprecated way. I try to do this by showing the possibilities and how to apply them by working on a real project (a voxel world renderer like Minecraft). Things that I consider important and other guides don't go over are loading textures from files and loading models. If people get stuck, they can ask questions under the chapters of the tutorials themselves. This prevents people from giving up early.

To ensure that these goals are met, I inevitably need help from people who are experienced with OpenGL and people who are new to it (potential audience for the site). Sometimes it's just not entirely clear to me how quick people will be able to pick up certain concepts and I really need user feedback for that.

The tutorials in the sidebar were all created as a response to the lack of modern OpenGL tutorials and they are indeed excellently written by people who know what they're talking about.

There is however one problem. The beginners still aren't reading them, the ancient NeHe tutorials still appeal a little too much to most beginners.

What can we do to change this? Instead of telling them how bad it is to learn old OpenGL or how much fancier VBOs are, why don't we show them something they can't make with only tools like glBegin equiped?

All current guides follow the same model: learn one new feature at a time and sometimes they even tell you how it will help you make your graphics that much better.

What if there would be a guide where the reader actually makes something throughout the chapters? You start with the basics, like setting up your first shaders and drawing your first triangle, but then you continue making an actual game. Minecraft is undoubtedly really hip at the moment and frankly a perfect concept for this. Learning to render a voxel world from the ground up teaches someone all the necessary traits to modern graphics: object picking, ssao post-processing, octree optimization, depth sorting, etc.

Think of how much more appealing OpenGL if you are taught how to make your own Minecraft inspired game, especially with the hype that currently surrounds it.

My GLSL shader was so heavy that it took my test case down to 11 FPS from being at around 35 without any lighting (but with a texture). I took a look at my code and saw that there were multiple calculations that would never change on a per vertex basis and I tried to move those back to the Vertex shader from the Fragment shader. By doing this I essentially eliminated all lagg that my shader created since it wasn't re-calculating these values for each and every pixel it had to draw (360 3D cubes with a texture circling around each other and always on screen)

The shader itself is still more of a test case but here's what I've started out with.

    		//calculate the cosine of the angle of incidence (brightness)
    		float brightness = dot(normal, surfaceToLight) / (length(surfaceToLight) * length(normal));
    		brightness = clamp(brightness, 0, 1);
    	
    		if(hasTexture==0.0)
    		{
    			outColor = brightness * vec4(light.color, 1) * vec4(Color,1.0f);
    		}
    		else
    		{
    			outColor = brightness * vec4(light.color, 1) * vec4(Color,1.0f) * texture(tex, Texcoord);

These two shaders working together took my test case down to 11 FPS. By moving over multiple parts of the lighting calculation to the Vertex shader I got it back up to 35 FPS at which the test case started (a 320% increase in speed).

**System/Code Info**  
My code was written in C++ for OpenGL 3.2 Core Profile on a AMD Readon HD 6770m GPU on a Macbook Pro.


What this method comes down to is the fact that a fragment shader works on a per pixel basis but might need information that's always the same for every pixel for that Vertex. By having the Vertex shader take care of that you take the amount of calculations down by a massive amount and thus get a massive performance gain.

Also GLSL links the outputs from a Vertex Shader directly to the inputs on a Fragment shader so you won't have to make any changes to your code base in order to allow these shaders to work (at least for this version of GLSL which is 1.50)",,False,,t5_2qzvf,1375007865.0,,,True,t3_1j7kpv,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/1j7kpv/a_quick_glsl_tip_for_a_potentially_massive_speed/,

The first three lessons should cover all the basics you need to start your own shader programming. 

The tutorials use the minimal [lwjgl-basics API](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics), but the concepts can easily be applied to any OpenGL-based library (such as LibGDX, SDL, Love2D, Pyglet, MonoTouch, etc). Each GLSL lesson includes a LibGDX port at the end; maybe in the future ports to other libraries will also be included.

This way we can increase/decrease the blur strength simply by sending a float uniform to the fragment shader; and otherwise everything renders as per usual (no extra draw passes or FBOs).

I describe the technique in brief [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/Lerp-Blur-Brief). I've included more discussion and LibGDX code in [this article](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/OpenGL-ES-Blurs).

Google found a bunch of people complaining about that, although apparently recent hardware supported OpenGL3 - and doesn't have Windows 8 drivers for it.

Oh, and MacOS apparently supports OpenGL3.2 at most - which is obviously a concern for portability.

1323846615.0,18,self.opengl,nc55x,VBO Multi Threading Question,refD,20,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/nc55x/vbo_multi_threading_question/,"I currently have two threads set up:

1. Main Rendering Thread, just binds and draws VBOs

2. Geometry generation thread, creates, binds and buffers VBOs

The second thread has it's own context that is shared with the first (share lists etc.).

For each piece of geometry it generates, the background thread makes the following calls:

     glGenBuffers();
     glBindBuffer(n);
     glBufferData(...);
     glBindBuffer(0);

And passes the VBO id through to the main thread for rendering, which then does:

    glBindBuffer(n);
    /* draw commands */

I incorrectly assumed that this would be ok. As the glBufferData command must block the current thread until the data has been uploaded I figured that would mean the VBO would be ready to go as soon as the command finishes.

I get occsional graphical flickering/garbage though (as if it's drawing partially garbage data). When I insert a glFlush() in to the background thread (before it hands over the VBO id), the problem disappears, but obviously, so does performance.

Is there an easy way to ensure a VBO is ready before handing it off? I took a quick look at sync objects in OGL4.2, but 4.2 isn't really an option as I want to use this across platforms.

Edit: 

I'm partially retarded, glFenceSync is OGL3.2, and is working as a decent solution, though I'm not yet sure of the performance implications of the glGetSync.

I've added a glFenceSync() call by the background thread which passes the sync object to the foreground thread, which then calls a GL32.glGetSync(). If it's not ready, the object with details about the geometry update (vbo names etc.) is requeued to be looked at again the next frame. 

Approximately 95% of updates from the background thread are ready immediately (upon the first call to get), so it's only the occasional update that was causing the artifact.

Now if only I could work out why my initial glBufferData() and post-orphan glBufferSubData() calls are giving me such unpredictable performance (sub millisecond up to 60ms).

Edit #2: Ok, still partially retarded, for a different reason.

My buffer calls are slow because I'm consuming 90% of my video card's RAM, so it's obviously suffering from fragment problems as I smash the hell out of it's internal ""malloc"" and ""free"". Reducing the geometry just a bit, brought all the calls reliably back down to within 1-2ms at worst (which is fair for 35k vertices imho).

From what I've gathered from googling, this is my current understanding of what to use:

* Use the modern, shader-based version of OpenGL because it's the new way of doing things. You can achieve a wider variety of effects with shaders.
* My laptop runs on an Intel card, so it only runs OpenGL 2.1. OpenGL core tutorials require OpenGL 3, and realizing this was extremely painful for me. Like, what the f*ck painful. Apparently the lowest common denominator for modern OpenGL is OpenGL 2.1, WebGL, and OpenGL ES. In OGL 2.1, I can replace ""in"" with ""attribute"" and ""out"" with ""varying"". WebGL has the benefit of having a uniform API across every OS, but the learning resources suck.

So I still have some burning questions:

1. **What can I do with OpenGL?** If I want to make a game, I can just use an abstraction over OpenGL (i.e. any game engine or game framework). Would the proper motivation be learning how to build your own abstractions? What other kind of software can I write?
Sidenote for myself: there's Cinder/openFrameWorks/Processing for loads of ""pretty picture"" software.
2. **What are shaders for, and how do I understand them?** I understand the basics of passing vertex data through the programmable pipeline and getting back fragment colors, enough to make an interpolated triangle appear on screen. But how do I start writing those insanely cool graphics effects on Shader Toy and GLSL Sandbox? Why do people write those - just 'cause? Or do these effects underlie some larger piece of software?
3. **What's the definitive starting book for computer graphics?** I'm going through Interactive Computer Graphics at the moment, and I know Real-Time Rendering gets recommended a lot. It's a lot of theory though, and I still feel like I don't get any practical experience writing programs. On the OpenGL reference side, I guess nothing beats the OpenGL.org website/wiki/sidebar tutorials.
4. **Where do graphics programmers hang out?** Python programmers hang out in /r/Python[1] , talk about web development, and I learn a lot from what people say. But /r/OpenGL[2] isn't as active, and I don't really get the ecosystem. Is there some secret forum on the interwebs somewhere?

It can ""store"" multiple meshes right now just fine (base-vertex), but then right now I'm dealing with simple ""meshes"" like cubes, pyramids, cylinders...

The engine user can set up as many of those mesh buffers as they please, and specify a capacity for how many vertices and indices the buffer should be able to store. (Allocated once via BufferData(nil), meshes written via BufferSubData.)

Looking at a real-world complete model such as sponza.obj using the AssImp viewer, I realize this:

**1.6 MB ""index buffers"", 24 MB ""vertex buffers"", 105 MB material textures**

Now the mesh buffers already utilize internally VAOs for minimizing certain GL calls (the bind-buffer and ""enable vertex attrib pointer"" stuff). Next, it is generally considered best practice to sort primitives by texture / material shader to minimize bindtexture/setuniform (or even useprogram) calls. Furthermore, while it is up to the user to specify the size of the mesh buffers (remember each is a VBO/IBO/VAO combination -- if it wasn't for IBOs being part of the VAO state I could do with just a single global VAO for now, but alas) -- chances are that a mesh such as Sponza is going to exceed a single mesh buffer and is to be spread across multiple such MBs, necessitating more bindvertexarray calls per pass.

Would it be most reasonable to decompose all meshes into their individual faces and sort those into individual VBO/IBO/VAO buckets based on their material? Or would it be just as good (or bad) as filling up the ""mesh buffers"" sequentially and continuing into the next one when the current one is ""full"". However, later on when I **do** sort by material, this might imply even more VAO switches than would strictly be necessary if I just ignored sort-by-material and rendered meshes in order out of their VAOs.

Right now, to minimize **both** VAO switches **and** material switches (whether that be a useprogram or a bindtexture/setuniform) I think I'd really have to store just the individual faces of the geometry, sorted into ""buffer buckets"" based on materials. (As we know, of course neither the GPU nor the GL really cares about what the designer declared an ""object"" or a ""model"", only about triangles to be rasterized.)

I recently started to write some openGL code and while the API is very well documented i have some questions about how to get the most out of them.

Im doing a fairly standard ( i think ) deferred renderer where i in a first step render geometry to the geometry fbo with 3 color texture render targets bound.

I add lights as fullscreen/globes/cones in a second light fbo, and in a final stage i render these two with a fullscreen quad while applying the first post-process pass to a third fbo, then bounce each post-process pass between fbo #3 and #4 until its drawn on the screen.

* First question would be if im i doing anything wrong here? Next step is to add shadows to the scene, what shadow method is standard today that works with a deferred renderer, and many lights? do i use a shadow-fbo or should it live in the light one?
 

* VBOs - Do i put all my vertices in one big VBO or do i create one for each object/model? My objects will rotate, translate and have their vertices moved a lot, what makes more sense it the way of storing them, CPU/client side data or in bound buffers only?

* Drawing multiple cubes (for example) should i use instanced drawing of multiple identical (except rotation/translation/scale) or add vertex-data for each of them via VBO? 

* FBOs - Should i use many FBOs and switch between them or switch the texture target it renders to and recycle the FBO? is there a cut off or max number of FBOs you can use?

* Is there a standard way to get a list or names of the variable inputs  defined in a shader? My application will accept user inputed shaders for post process stage and i want to find out what variables they want to use so i can hook them up, is this doable without some regex or markup or similar on the shader source files?

The last time I used OpenGL was version 1.4.  I understand the ideas behind Vertex/Index Buffers since I used Direct3D 9.

I've seen different definitions of what vertex array object is.  http://openglbook.com describes it as the ""object that describes how the vertex attributes are stored in a VBO.""  If this is correct, then I imagine I would somewhere tell OpenGL that my buffer has 4 floats.  I'm further confused that when I call glVertexAttribPointer, I don't pass in which buffer I'm referring to.  However, given the definition of VAO, I thought the VAO should be passed in as a parameter.

From the best I can see, it seems like once a VAO is bound, any subsequent call to bind a buffer is automatically assumed to work with the bound VAO.  If the above description is correct, wouldn't all VBOs within a VAO need to use the same vertex format?  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I can imagine it being an annoyance in certain situations.

The other definition of VAO I've found stated it as a grouping of VBOs.  This would match with my theory that each buffer than gets bound would belong to the last VAO that was bound.  If so, what is the VAO used for after it is bound?  It seems unnecessary.

tl;dr What is a VAO, and how/why do I use it?",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_17h31w,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/17h31w/would_someone_please_explain_vertex_array_objects/,

Let's say we have created a class ""Box"". This class has it's own index buffer object, vertex buffer object and vertex array object, and it handles its own drawing.

A typical render call would then be:

    for shader in shaderPrograms:
        glUseProgram(shader)
        drawObjectsUsing(shader) // draw all objects that have this shader program

Since overlap would be possible, it would be benificial to have one big index buffer object, instead of n smaller ones (with n being the number of cubes). However, if the cubes are dynamic and can move, that index buffer object should be generated every single frame.

Constantly updating a VBO using GL_STREAM_DRAW or constantly updating shader uniforms?

I want to draw thousands of quads in an OpenGL accelerated OpenGL game. I have designed it by defining a VBO contaning a 1x1 sized quad positioned at 0,0. For each object I want to draw I have stored a matrix in the object that will transform this 1x1 object into the object I want to draw. The matrix is precomputed and only changes whenever the object needs to move.

So with this in mind, is it faster to simply precompute the coordinates on the CPU and updating the VBO I want to draw with the GL_STREAM_DRAW mode - or is it faster to use my matrix uniform idea? The reason why I'm asking is because updating the coordinates with a varying VBO is potentially less data transfered to the GPU than when using the uniform idea. I just think I read somewhere that uniforms are much more optimized for setting before each draw call than updating a VBO is as the GL_STREAM_DRAW mode is only a hint to the GPU. It doesn't have to enforce it - so it could get slow on some GPU's.

For various reasons I can't know when objects will move or get destroyed so I can't really accelerate this using other techniques that I'm aware of.

Overlay shader...takes the background as a texture2D sampler and overlays the current fragment by pretty much any overlay more in PSD plus a few more. Works in ortho or perspective so you can actually rotate around a scene with overlay modes :D

Gradient shader: Renders a gradient of type linear, radial or box with up to 40 gradient points(arbitrary, you can increase if you wish uses a uniform array of floats and a uniform integer for colorcount)

I'll look into hosting it. Dreamhost is cheap. I will include both the vertex(very simple) and the fragment shader for these. Overtime I will add more, but for now, we can have a place to start. Once I get it up, I'll add a new post. Guess I'll call it Reddit OpenGL shader resource or somethin. Any ideas would be appreciated.

I render diffuse + normals + specular passes to a framebuffer; and also store the depth into a texture.


The normals are converted from tangent space to normalized device coordinates using 



N = projectionMatrix\*TBNMatrix\*normalMapSample;



The deferred shading shader reconstructs the 3D geometry within the normalized device coordinate (NDC) cube in the following way:



x = texCoord.x \* 2 - 1;


y = texCoord.y \* 2 - 1;


z = linearizedDepth \* 2 - 1;

L = projectionMatrix * lightPosition;



L = L/L.w; 


(oddly enough, lightPosition [0,1,0,1] gives me a w coordinate of 0 making my NDC coordinates garbage)


This light position and the normals/reconstructed points are used to calculate lighting.


I suspect that either my normals or my light position conversion are incorrect, I'm also a little cautious about my reconstruction of the NDC cube but according to my understanding of the coordinate system it makes sense.


If anyone can shed some light on my problems I'd be quite happy.

You should call gl3wInit() after your window creation and it will load all the functions defined in the OpenGL 3 core profile.

This might sound like a really dumb question, but it's a bit less dumb than it initially appears. I'm definitely **not** asking about writing a full games engine - been there, done that, felt the pain. I'm just wondering about the code necessary to take a stream of verts, triangles and textures (and texture coordinates) plus some light information, and render all that to the screen in realtime in a reasonably up-to-date and visually pleasing way. 

Specifically, I'm wondering about a renderer that does:

* Per-pixel lighting - ideally from an arbitrary number of light sources.
* Hard and soft shadows in realtime (no baked textures or lightmaps!)
* Normal maps
* Diffuse, specular, opacity maps
* Ambient occlusion (SSAO will be fine, but ideally something a bit more sophisticated)
* Color bleed or some other simple(ish) global illumination fake. 
* Bokeh depth of field (that doesn't look godawful)
* Antialiasing (any AA technique is fine)
* Volumetric fog would be lovely too :) 
* Nvidia only. I don't care about ATI as I'll be using an NVidia card. 

The specific project I'm considering (and hiring for, incidentally, if the scope's right) is a new renderer for the mocap and animation tool Motionbuilder, which has recently introduced its [Custom Renderer API](http://docs.autodesk.com/MB/2014/ENU/MotionBuilder-SDK-Documentation/index.html). They say that API should make it reasonably easy to plug an entire new rendering engine into the program, and that's what I plan to do!

Unfortunately, it's been a few years since I had anything like this written, and so I'm not sure if all this fancy new shader and GLSL stuff makes renderers like this a lot easier or a lot harder to write! 

So, help me, /r/opengl - is this a few man hours, a few dozen, a few hundred, a few thousand, or ""oh god, don't ask""?

I'm working on setting up a deferred rendering engine, but I haven't figured out how to set up shaders to render to different components of framebuffer objects. It's in Java using LWJGL, though as far as I can tell, all the opengl calls work about the same.

I've been able to find plenty of resources on setting up the FBO, connecting textures to the attachments, and checking to see if it was built right, and I'm virtually 100% certain that I've not made any errors so far. As for using the FBOs, I've not seen any examples which are compatible with what I'm doing (most use older extensions, others use newer glsl versions) and I'm not finding anything relevant when I try and dig through the documentation. If anybody knows of an example, that would be really helpful, as I've gotten through so far mostly on copying examples and looking up calls that I don't know.

Right now this is essentially what I'm doing;

Creating the FBO:
Generating a FrameBuffer, a renderbuffer(for depth/stencil) and some textures
Binding the Framebuffer
Binding and initializing each texture, attaching it to its colorattachment
Binding the renderbuffer, calling glrenderbufferstorage, and attaching that as depth/stencil attachment
(at this point no opengl errors, framebufferstatus is complete, max color attachments is fewer than I'm using)


Rendering:
Bind the FBO
Draw to it with a test shader, renders a scene in two channels to two color attachments
Unbind the FBO
Draw the textures from the FrameBuffer on a screen sized quad with a different shader which combines the channels

What I get:
Black

Right now I've sort of ended up with my own non-working method which I got out of spending an entire weekend confused/frustrated, but what I'm doing to connect the shaders is:

In the first shader program (the fragment shader should render two two channels)
I've declared two outs, one for each texture, and I'm trying to bind these to the FBO. I was originally binding them to the frag data locations, but I read that the gl_FragData[i] was deprecated and it wasn't working. Right now they aren't bound to anything.

In the second shader program (which just draws to the screen)
I've just got two samplers. I sample each texture and combine them. When I modify this to include an outline, the outline will show, so I believe this is working right.

Sadly, I can't use gDEBugger. I have to run everything through optirun (a linux hack to make optimus systems use the better of the two video cards) and nothing I could find would allow it to monitor opengl calls without disabling it. Without it, I have to use the onboard gpu, which doesn't support opengl3+.

I'm working on pulling out the rendering code from my project so I can show the relevant parts to people, but I'll need some time to get it extracted and cleaned nicely. I'll answer any questions about the code/technique if it could help.(and if you really want to see it all in context, I'll pm you the github for it, though it's not something I'm proud of)

Also, I'm relatively new to opengl, so general tips/pointers are welcome too, although I'm somewhat time constrained, so I can't promise I'll look into things soon unless they're really necessary.

I apologize if this is too much information off the bat, I just don't want to leave anything that could be important out. Thanks.

TL;DR How do you hook up a shader program and fbo with multiple color attachments so you can just specify the color of each pixel for each attachment texture in the frag shader. (in opengl 3.2/glsl150)

EDIT: 
I've finally figured it out! The main/really stupid error was that I wasn't flipping my input buffer before calling glDrawBuffers() (In Java, you need to use nio buffers, so I was essentially passing it a buffer with nothing left to read. This makes it hard to draw to the attachments you want to)

 I've also cleaned up some functions based on what's been said here.

Been looking around but couldn't find any app that's a ""definite"", complete, reference Collada *1.5*-compliant viewer app... Used ""AssImp Viewer"" so far, but now noticed it does not properly support strictly-1.5 documents -- only those that, even if versioned as 1.5, would be source-identical if they were versioned as 1.4.1.

I'm not looking for one of those countless tutorial apps people build where they just read out some mesh vertices off the XML and fire them to deprecated-fixed-function-pipeline glVertex calls, but rather a proper 1.5 implemenation that at a minimum understands texture/image/sampler* elements.

Background -- I'm actually in the process of building one myself as part of the go:ngine project -- which is precisely the reason I'm looking for a lightweight reference viewer to compare against.

More background, I'm in the process of adding on-the-fly conversion of 1.4.1 documents to 1.5 (as I'd rather implement just a 1.5 DOM than 2 concurrent DOM logical-blocks, yet the vast majority of docs out there and being exported by current tools is 1.4.1). For the most part, that conversion is straightforward, a couple of renames, a few attribute values rewritten etc. But then for removing &lt;surface&gt; nodes and rewriting their associated &lt;sampler*&gt; nodes to directly reference the appropriate &lt;image&gt;, I'd really like to test the conversion result in a 1.5 viewer known to display strictly correct 1.5 documents and ideally rejecting incomplete / faulty ones.

Why whouldn't I stick with 1.4.1? Because I find version 1.5 superior in terms of feature set, expressive power and consistency. And I'd like to model go:ngine's scene-graph-and-assets part closely after Collada 1.5 (although it will be loaded and saved from its own binary format -- Collada here then is simply the one and only import option for external contents, and ideally only 1.5 at that, with imported 1.4.1 docs being bootstrapped into 1.5 in-memory and on-the-fly).",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_13t86h,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/13t86h/anyone_know_a_collada_15_viewer_by_the_way_is/,

Firstly, where can I find a list of at least all of the common image formats and pixel types that might be supported? I've tried having a look at existing source, but every project I look at seems to have a slightly different list, some with all kinds of weird and wonderful formats.

Secondly, what's the link between a base format (e.g. GL_RGB), the internal format (e.g. GL_RGB10_A2), the external format (e.g. GL_BGR) and the pixel type (e.g. GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT)? It seems to me that if you specify a sized format, then specifying the pixel type is redundant. So far, I'm trying to implement something like this:

    struct Format {
        GLenum base;
        GLenum internal;
        GLenum type;
        int bpp;
        int channels;
        int redbits, bluebits, greenbits, alphabits;
        bool compressed;
    };

Then I think I should be able to create a big table like this:

    const struct Format formats[] = {
        { GL_RGB, GL_RGB4, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_EXT, 16, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, false },
        { GL_RGB, GL_RGB5, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1_EXT, 16, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, false },
        etc.
    }

The idea is to then create functions to find a format based on various criteria. For example:

    struct Format format = getFormat(GL_RGB4);
    struct Format format = getFormat(GL_RGB, /* red */ 5, /* blue */ 5, /* green */ 5, );

I'm just having difficulty finding all the information required to populate this table, such as a reasonable list of formats, what the pixel type should be etc. I'm not even sure if this is a sensible way to do it. Most existing source I look at seems to use lots of switch statements (e.g. to get a base format from an internal format).

* The model matrix: If you have a mesh, the vertices of the mesh are relative to the center of the mesh, the model matrix transforms verticies to be relative to the center of space (aka transforms vertices from model space to world space). The model matrix can be created by multiplying the rotations, scale and translation matrices.

My question: should I be creating the model matrix by multiplying the rotation matrices, scale matrix and translation matrix together, or is there a way to create the matrix more directly? I guess I could manually multiply the matrices out to see what I need to create the model matrix, but it seems that it would be a bitch to do.

* The view matrix: so this matrixes transforms vertices from world space to camera space, i.e. transforms them to become relative to the camera. This is the matrix you would manipulate in order to rotate/translate/scale the entire scene around the camera.

My question: I can create this matrix in the same way that I can create the model matrix and I can also use a ""lookAt"" function to create it, correct?

* Projectition matrix: takes the vertices that where transformed by the model and view matrix and projects them to where they should be on the screen. This matrix is used to create perspective or an orthographic projection can be used.

First of all, when researching about OpenGL I remember people using glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION) and stuff and I was wondering if doing so is deprecated? Because in this tutorial it only shows about doing it with vertex shaders, of course this tutorial teaches only modern opengl which is what I want to learn, not deprecated old opengl. If using glMatrixMode is NOT deprecated, then why would you not want to use that instead? Wouldn't it be much easier than having to create tons of vertex shaders for every different kind of object or something you want to make?

Secondly, when it talks about matrices, here http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/Positioning/Tut04%20The%20Matrix%20Has%20You.html I don't understand when he says ""In this example, the matrix is stored in column-major order. So array index 14 is in the third row of the fourth column."" If it's in column-major order, and we're talking about index 14, how is it in the third row of the fourth column?

For the past couple of days I've been experimenting with OpenGL via SDL on my Macbook (running Mountain Lion) in a 3.2 context. It works like it should but I somehow think that the performance is just way slower then what it can actually handle.

Right now I've got a scene that draws a 26Mb ship (obj format, triangulated) that is purely using vertices, no color, textures or light added yet and it's going at a steady 26 FPS instead of 60 FPS. On fullscreen mode it drops even further down to 20 FPS.

The object has 1,906,359 vertices (which just hold the X, Y and Z in float) that create 635,453 GL_TRIANGLES when drawing. The model looks great just like it should but the FPS dropped from 60 FPS to 26 FPS with just that model being drawn.

Am I expecting to much from my GPU or is there something I can do to fix this? I've also got the same kind of issue when I want to draw multiple objects instead of just a big one, it can only handle about 350 glDrawArrays calls (on a simple 2 triangle plane with a texture) before it starts to dip bellow 55FPS while a friend of mine can do about 5000 of them and have no problem at all at 60FPS (not sure what GPU he uses)

Here's the code I use to initialise the OpenGL object and upload everything to the GPU

    void OBJModel::finilizeGL()
    {
    	//Create the vertex buffer
    	glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo);
    	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
    	glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(Vertex_P)*vertexAmount, vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    	
    	glGenVertexArrays(1, &amp;vao);
    	glBindVertexArray(vao);
    	
    	
    	//Create the shader
    	basicShader = new BasicShader_P();
    	
    	//Set the projection
    	glm::mat4 proj = glm::perspective(45.0f, WIDTH / HEIGHT, 1.0f, 1000.0f);
    	glUniformMatrix4fv(basicShader-&gt;uniProj, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(proj));
    	
    	printf(""%i vertices\n"",vertexAmount);
    }

And the code I use to render my object

    void OBJModel::render()
    {
    	//Activate current data for the render
    	basicShader-&gt;activate();
    	//tx-&gt;activate();
    	glBindVertexArray(vao);
    	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
    	
    	
    	//Model position, rotation and scale
    	glm::mat4 model;
    	//Set the position
    	model = glm::translate(model, glm::vec3(X,Y,Z));
    	//Rotate the object
    	model = glm::rotate(model,pitch,glm::vec3(-1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
    	model = glm::rotate(model,yaw,glm::vec3(0.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f));
    	model = glm::rotate(model,roll,glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f));
    	//Set the scale
    	model = glm::scale(model, glm::vec3(scale,scale,scale));
    	//Send to the GPU
    	glUniformMatrix4fv(basicShader-&gt;uniModel, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(model));
    	
    	
    	//View matrix (should be bound to the entire scene)
    	glm::mat4 view = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3( 0.0f, -0.001f, 2.0 ),//eye
    								 glm::vec3( 0.0f,  0.0f,   0.0f ),//target
    								 glm::vec3( 0.0f,  0.0f,   1.0f )//up axis
    								 );
    	glUniformMatrix4fv(basicShader-&gt;uniView, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(view));
    	
    	
    	//Draw the image
    	glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, sizeof(Vertex_P)*vertexAmount);
    	//glDrawElements(GL_QUADS, 24, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, (void*)0);
    	
    	
    	//Check for any errors
    	GLenum error = GL_NO_ERROR;
    	while((error = glGetError()) != GL_NO_ERROR)
    	{
    		printf(""OpenGL Error in Cube::render(): %s\n"", gluErrorString(error));
    	}
    }

The BasicShader_P is a class that just handles the creation of a shader that just accepts and uses a vertex position.

I've tried uploading just the vertices as their original state and using a indices array to tell the GPU which point to use to draw a triangle but that just hasn't worked at all, drawing quads also doesn't work since those were apparently deprecated as of OpenGL 3.1 (which I find a bit weird)

Is there anything I can do to increase the performance drastically?

The mainView-&gt;render() takes only ~0.15 Milliseconds while the SDL_RenderPresent(ren) takes up 41 Milliseconds. How to fix?

Edit 2:

I ported the code over to a Cocoa and Objective-C project with a NSOpenGLView and instantly got up to 30-48 FPS (Once it get to about 30 FPS it jumps right back up to 48 FPS and starts to decline again (each time taking about 15 seconds). But anyway I know I won't be using SDL anymore (plus my engine I'm working on will only require a wrapper in the language of your choice at the end so the port was really easy)

Edit 3:

Ok I have no idea what the heck is going on with my Macbook right now.. Now the SDL app without any changes over the slow version is running at 40 FPS as well.. Dafuq?

Edit 4:

Problem found thanks to /u/kimixa the glDrawArrays() was drawing sizeof(Vertex_P)*vertexAmount amount of vertices which is sizeof(Vertex_p) to much. I had some wierd graphical glitches before without it (probably my own fault) but it just shot up to 80-180 FPS (switching quite a bit) on the Cocoa and Objective-C version and 60 FPS on the SDL version! I'm going to continue on with the Objective-C version (it's just a wrapper, the engine is in C++ and I'm aiming for it to be cross-platform)",,False,,t5_2qzvf,1372277884.0,,,True,t3_1h3ly7,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/1h3ly7/low_performance_on_a_amd_readon_hd_6770m_opengl/,

I'm looking for a tutorial or book on OpenGL 3.0 or higher. I've found arcsynthesis's tutorial, and some others, but I'm not sure I've found the right one for me.

Most of them simply spew some code at you, without letting you know where to put it (I know, I should be able to figure that out myself when I want to learn something like OpenGL, but SOME help would be nice, so I can try out the examples and not just feel like I'm learning the theory behind OpenGL). Others mix the older versions and newer versions of OpenGL, which is terribly confusing.

What I would want to be able to do after reading a few books and experimenting is this:
Create a 3D scene with a heightmap-based terrain and some blocks. I'd also like to have lighting and some shadows. Maybe even create a simple editor to create nice scenes in.

I study Computer Science so I know some Linear Algebra and Analysis.

So, with that information, which book or tutorial could suit my needs?

I am having a ton of trouble getting my openGL configured, I am
currently using freeglut, windows 7, eclipse 64-bit, and MinGW.
When I run the program no errors occur; however, no window pops up. I was curious of a few things:

* Has anyone ever experienced this issue before and what did you do to solve it (if any)?
* What IDE do you guys use to compile your OpenGL code I am willing to make the switch.

These are the directions I follow:

EDIT: 

So sorry I didn't include my code, http://pastebin.com/Zrp0U2kj
my code varies slightly from the example code, in that I've added a print line.

SECOND EDIT: 

[I got it working;](http://imgur.com/VuGQjGw) however, in eclipse, I need to run it in debug mode if I run it normally (the green arrow) I recieve this error on the stack:

     &lt;terminated, exit value: -1073741701&gt;C:\Users\USERNAME\workspace\GLDemo\Debug\GLDemo.exe (6/1/13 7:10 PM)	

Code::Blocks works fine. No problems at all great tutorial for configuring code::blocks to run with opengl and free glut exist here:  [Code::Blocks + FreeGlut] (http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php?title=Using_FreeGlut_with_Code::Blocks)

NEW QUESTION:

* Does anyone even use eclipse for opengl development?
* Also a lot of the tutorials cater to developing with opengl not much regarding configuration/setup, would it be possible to include some links on the side for configuration with some up-to-date steps for different OS's. If needed I don't mind trying to contribute.

I know that older versions of glsl don't allow for bitwise manipulation so I was wondering if anyone had any tips or thoughts on how I might be able to pack and unpack a set of masks using a single texture.

Would one of these ways be best or is there an alternative I'm not thinking of.

Right now I have a Mesh class that encapsulates ALL mesh related data (vertex, normals, tangents, uvs) and will draw it as well.  I have not implemented the animation yet or bones. 

Right now the command Mesh.LoadModel(""filename.obj""); would load an obj file and generate all the necessary data into the buffers.  The way I thought about organizing it was my class NPC would have an Mesh object.  However, the way it is currently designed it would load each mesh multiple times and waste a lot of memory in the long haul, as well as load time with larger amounts of data.  I'm trying to find a better way to do this. Here are what I've thought of.

A. Clone the data for each instance of the class, this still wastes memory by storing the same information multiple times, but it gets around parsing files many times.

B. I'm not sure if this would work as I do not know how the animations work in detail yet. But store base vertex data and transformations performed to the animation separately so they can all point to the same vertex data, but have separate drawing calls and transformations.  This sounds kind of sketchy and questionable.  The code wouldn't be very readable, most likely.

C.  Something I'm not thinking of? Does anyone have some suggestions on how this is commonly performed?

So, I have a texture with some single ""points"" (1 pixel size) on it, the rest is black. I want to find these points for further processing. I try to implement some kind of pattern searching, and this texture is the output of the previous filtering.

Let's say I have around 20 points on the texture, all different coordinates. To find them, I render the texture to the host so I can iterate through all values. This is too slow, my framerate is horrible.

Now, I'm still new to openGL ES, but I searched everywhere for some hints or similar. Finding the position of the points can't be done in openGL ES, as far as I know. This is a mathematical use-case, and the only way to get information from GPU to CPU is by rendering the texture so the host can read it as 'array'.

But this is why I ask here, maybe someone with more knowledge than me can help me out here, or at least tell me it's useless to invest more work.

Now, to come to my questions:

* first of all: in general, any way of 'searching' pixels on the GPU and using their position data for further processing (this implies that I don't need to use CPU, or at least help the CPU to process faster)?
* It might be helpful if I only know the x-coordinates of the points, as for every possible x, there is one point maximum (only one y to every x).
* Is there any way I can transform the texture to 1D (shrink the texture to only one 'line' of values, e.g. sum of all pixels with same x, to find the sum over all pixels with same x as output at (x/0) like value &gt; 0: interesting x; value = 0: not interesting).
* I also thought of horizontal lines generated by vertex shader, starting at (x/y) to (x/0), to achieve the same as above.
* I know, vertex shaders can't perform texture lookup on the iPhone. So the idea with the lines is pointless, right?

If you've got any idea, please help! Transforming texture, special openGL operations I don't know about, anything?

Short (TL;DR): Single colored pixels on texture, need to find them as fast as possible for further processing in openGL ES. Best without using CPU. openGL ES so limited, I am desperate!

I've been doing some basic research into implementing ""bokeh"" depth of field. I'm trying to get a general understanding of it before digging into particular implementations and tutorials and in this process I've come up with some of my own ideas.



If anyone has experience with this and wants to share their knowledge I'd appreciate it!


My idea is this:


Deferred shading already requires you to render to many screen buffers that contain, along with everything else, depth information. As I understand it, the uniqueness of bokeh vs. standard DOF implementations is that the blurring is radial and is effectively a series of circular sprites for each out-of-focus point. The radii of these circles is based on the unsigned distance from the focal plane of the lens (i.e. an absolute value of the difference between the center pixel's depth and the depth of the other pixels)


I was thinking that an efficient way of getting these bokeh sprites would be to render the color buffer to lower resolution textures (which you're likely already doing for bloom or other post-processing effects) and create a circle-grid that looks something like [this](http://www.clker.com/cliparts/F/D/l/I/A/L/circles-chess-board-md.png) which can be used to mask the low-res textures such that you get a series of circles instead of pixels.


Then, in the actual DOF shader, one could access the appropriately downscaled version of the color buffer based on the depth-difference of the current pixel and blend the screen buffer with the downscaled buffers by a factor that takes into consideration the depth difference, (i.e. use depth difference as alpha so areas close to the focal plane will not be blurred and areas furthest will be completely blurred).



My questions to you guys are:


1. Is this even what bokeh DOF is all about?



2. What resources for bokeh DOF do you guys have handy that don't turn up easily in google?



3. Are my ""optimizations"" really optimizations at all? Or am I overcomplicating the problem?



4. Would this look any better than a gaussian blur texture blended with a similar method as I describe in my last paragraph.




EDIT: I forgot to indicate that the downsampling would include a gaussian blur process as well, otherwise you wouldn't get blurring but rather some weird aliased low/high res mixture result",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_snlef,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/snlef/bokeh_depth_of_field_implementation_idea_would/,

This mostly worked OK, but I was using a C# windows form and OpenTK control to do it. 

The idea is that the program running would still have focus even though mine would always display on top.

Now I want to see if I can improve it at all.

I've looked at creating a layered window with WS_Layered and WS_Transparent, and I think that might work in most cases.

I've also looked at using GetDC null and just writing to the top-most windows, but most guides that show you how to do that also say that isn't the best option with windows vista and 7, that it can really screw things up.

I've looked at using hardware video overlays, of which there is very little documentation, I've found a few options for sending bitmaps, but grabbing my frame, rendering it to an invisible window, then rendering it back to the overlay seems tedious. The only working code I've found to do this is in DirectDraw7, surely there must be a better way.

There is also DrawDib and stretchDIBits http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms708163(v=vs.85).aspx, but from my understanding these were depreciated some time ago. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145121(v=vs.85).aspx

So do any of you Redditors have any input or have done something in the past that's worked OK?

There are a few more videos with good examples but this one does it's job.

Now, my problem is not the algorithm, i already did the algorithm (using Cellullar Automata) to produce this effect and it works well, even though it needs some teaking.

My problem is when i render it, i am relatively new to modern opengl and i have no idea if i am doing correctly or not, i am (coding and learning on the fly).

I am using vbo for the blocks and that works great and another vbo for the water  and at first it renders everything correctly but, as time goes by it gets slower and slower and slower until it goes under 1 fps. And i am positive that this is because i am constantly updating and rebuilding my vbo but if i don't update it constantly, the water animation becomes slow and sluggish and i don't want that at all.

So, if someone can help me and point me in the right direction i would appreciate it very much.

EDIT: I even made a video to demonstrate this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2NY2a_k13c)

I'm not looking for the fastest way to do this, but something that gives a good balance between engineering effort and performance.

Right now, I'm simply replicating 2 of my vertices to make two triangles out of each quad. While I suspect that this is not the worst way of doing this, I dislike the idea that I have to make an additional copy of my geometry data before sending it to the GPU.
Using index buffers is obviously better for both rendering performance (post-VS caching, even though my VS are usually very simple) and bus-transfer as long as my vertices are bigger than 6 bytes (Or 5 with restart indices). On the other hand, I will have to update an additional buffer for each draw call, which will complicate my code a lot.

I do this because most tutorials and books focus on teaching you new stuff on a single triangle/cube/... and I want to try to create a wrapper for OpenGL so I can play around a bit.

What I'm doing here is drawing two red triangles: one in the upper left corner of the screen and one in the lower right, so that the entire screen is red. First I load and compile my vertex and fragment shaders, which I'll include here.

**Vertex shader**
    
    #version 330
    
    layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
    
    void main()
    {
        gl_Position = position;
    }

**Fragment shader**
    
    #version 330
    
    out vec4 outputColor;
    
    void main()
    {
        outputColor = vec4(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    }
    
I call glUseProgram so that the shaders are used and then call glutMainLoop (I'm using freeglut).
The draw callback is the following method:

    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    triangle1.render();
    triangle2.render();
    glutSwapBuffers();
    
The render code from the Triangle class is implemented as follows:

    glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
    glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);
    
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
    
    glDisableVertexAttribArray(0);
    
So, here are the questions - sorry about all the code!

* Do I really need to create the VBO every draw call, or am I doing too much work? Can I maybe call glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo) only once?
* If I want to use a different shader for the two triangles, I call glUseProgram on a different shader program before drawing the other triangle. Is this a good way of doing things?
* Should I keep a reference to shaders in the objects that use them or just store them in some ShaderManager and call glUseProgram in the render code of the according triangles (well, don't answer this question if it is irrelevant to OpenGL and just a design decision)

Finally, now that I have your attention anyway, one last question:
* Do big products usually exist of multiple shaders? If so, what shaders do they use? I understand how I can use shaders to reposition and colour objects, but I'm confused as to how they work in a real application.

Thanks so much for your feedback,

a beginning OpenGL learner.

I need some advice or pointers on OpenGL versions. Right now I want to support versions as old as 2.1 but to avoid (as much as possible) using deprecated API.

Right now I'm going to use VAOs or VBOs for drawing objects, and do most of the mathy stuff through the vertex shader. I can't find a good way to avoid using the matrix stack however. I can send viewing transforms to the shaders through uniforms just fine, it's just that I can't find a good way to do it for multiple programs. If you want to swap to a different shader program during the render process, you gotta send that new shader the view matrix. So that gives me this really ass-backwards need for coupling between the shaders and the viewing matrix (which the renderer classes worry about).

Did some searching, and uniform buffers seemed like the way to go, but they're unsupported in 2.1. Am I just silly to want to avoid the matrix stack?

The solution was the most hacky crap ever, and I can't say I am happy with it. I use an if statement to check if the uv coordinates are near an edge, and if they are I use a manual mipmap level computed purely on distance. Otherwise, I use the default mipmapping. It works but god is it a shitty solution.

I'm working on a voxel game and am trying to implement mipmapping for my blocks, since our artist is going to be sending some high res textures soon. However, I am getting some strange artifacts. On the edges of blocks there is a thin colored line. 

[Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/tqTLiVe.png)

I am setting up the textures with:

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_EXT);

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE_EXT);

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST); 
		
glGenerateMipmap(GL_TEXTURE_2D);

The plant textures you see that have the artifacts are at the top edge of the texture atlas also, so they are not pulling colors from other textures. To try to see if it was an issue with interpolation from neighboring textures I scaled the UV coordinates down so that the texture was a small subtexture of the origional, and I still got the same artifacts.

What's the problem?,metaleap,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/19tgcv/radar_approach_to_frustum_culling_fail_at_first/,"Trying to get at least the **very simple** [part 1 of the Lighthouse3D Radar Frustum Culling tutorial][1] to work... and am absolutely baffled that I can't even make that part work in my renderer.

So the first step is: you test if a point is in front the near-plane or behind the far-plane, and early-cull if that's the case. (If not, you'd then perform further tests but I'm stuck just with that first part.)

I use the world-space center (x1y2z3) of a 2x2 cube and have a camera that I can move around and rotate freely. All my vector and matrix stuff must be rather solid as the renderer otherwise works just fine. So here's my take (in Go) of this first part, the simple ""Z vs near-or-far"" testing:

    func (cam *Camera) frustumHasPoint(point *Vec3) bool {
    	var pc Vec3
    	v := point.Sub(&amp;cam.Controller.Pos)  // point minus camPos
    	ref := cam.Controller.dir  // take a copy of camDir
    	ref.Z = -ref.Z
    	ref.Normalize() // camDir was already normalized but anyway...
    	pc.Z = v.Dot(&amp;ref)
    	if pc.Z &gt; cam.Perspective.ZFar || pc.Z &lt; cam.Perspective.ZNear {
    		return false
    	}
    	return true
    }

Now why do I reverse the Z of ref? Because in the tutorial they write: ""Notice that the referential in the figure is not a right hand system (as in OpenGL), because the orientation of Z has been reversed to make the tutorial more intuitive"" -- well, in a GL tutorial of course this has the opposite effect...

Well if do reverse Z as above, it culls more than it should about 50% of the time; if I don't, then it ""over-culls"" about 98% of the time..

This stuff should be so simple right? What am I missing? Been thinking long and hard about this and just not getting anywhere.. would greatly appreciate any pointers...

So it seems from the spec that what I have to do is create a buffer of matricies, then set pointers 4 consecutive vertex attribute locations, one for each row in the matrix.

So here's what I've done:

    buffer = (GLfloat*)malloc(vertexCount*vertexByteSize);
    glGenBuffers(1, &amp;bufferId);

    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, bufferId);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertexCount*vertexByteSize, buffer, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);

    glEnableVertexAttribArray(kAttributeLocation);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(kAttributeLocation+1);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(kAttributeLocation+2);
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(kAttributeLocation+3);

    glVertexAttribPointer(kAttributeLocation+0,  4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, vertexByteSize, BUFFER_OFFSET(0));
    glVertexAttribPointer(kAttributeLocation+1,  4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, vertexByteSize, BUFFER_OFFSET(4));
    glVertexAttribPointer(kAttributeLocation+2,  4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, vertexByteSize, BUFFER_OFFSET(8));
    glVertexAttribPointer(kAttributeLocation+3,  4, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, vertexByteSize, BUFFER_OFFSET(12));

I am not very experienced in OpenGL, to say the least, but needed to build a visualization of 2D function - a complex and pretty much irregular surface, that is.

My surface is built by triangle strips in glBegin-glEnd procedures, all put in a display list.

When the scene is set up, I set up polygon mode as follows:
  glPolygonMode (GL_BACK, GL_NONE);
  glPolygonMode (GL_FRONT, GL_FILL);

I can't remember why I decided GL_NONE was a viable option,
but later I read in the respective OpenGL SDK article, that glPolygonMode only takes GL_POINT, GL_LINE or GL_FILL as mode.

What confused me is when GL_NONE was used, I could see the surface from both sides. I expected it to be visible only from one side.

The strange thing is, when GL_NONE is used, i can render 20-25 frames per second, while with GL_POINT for the back face i only get around 10.

The renderer was initially written in ES 1.0, but we've read so much about how we really should be working with ES 2.0 because it's more modern and faster on Android, so we're rewritting the renderer (and other parts) to work with ES 2.0.

The problem is, currently the code is mostly this:

for (Texture texture : textures) {
gl.glLoadIdentity();
gl.glTranslatef(x,y,z);
texture.draw(gl);
}

A little simplified, but, surprisingly that's most of the way it's done now.

So, since that doesn't work in ES 2.0, we started implementing our own function to do identity and translate, but that just means that 1) we're not really using shaders much and, 2) the matrix math that was on the GPU is not being done on the CPU.

For an application, such as the one I'm working with, how am I supposed to do this?

It also doesn't help that I only knew the most basic things about OpenGL until, like, yesterday, and so I'm trying to learn the basics of it, on Android, and how to rewrite everything in ES 2.0.

So I guess another question would be, is this even sane?  Is it always better to move to ES 2.0, or, given the way we're using things, would it be smarter to stay with 1.0?  Or is there a way to get the benefits of 2.0 but mimic the fixed function pipeline of 1.0?

Originally, I was just trying to track objects based on color using OpenCV. I actually have that working pretty well. I have a Playstation Move controller hooked up via bluetooth, I can set the color, and track it. 

After I got that working, I thought it'd be cool to integrate my OpenCV project with a simple OpenGL program. The idea was to have my object tracking code update a sphere created in OpenGL and move it on screen in relation to the user's movements.

So here's what I've got: (Disclaimer: I'm very new to OpenGL)

Inside my openGL display function:

* I find and track the circle created by the Playstation Move controller on screen. (I do this by finding the center of the circle)

* On each frame I compare the x and y values of the current center of the circle to the x and y values of the center found in the previous frame. This is how I determine movement / adjust the openGL program.

* If the center has changed by at least 4 pixels in any direction I consider that movement and adjust the sphere on screen accordingly.

So, that's the basic idea. Determine movement by comparing x and y values and translate the sphere in the appropriate direction.

This seems to work ""ok"", at best. I get reasonable results if I move the controller slowly and only in left/right or up/down directions. It does respond to diagonal movement, but it doesn't look nearly as smooth. I get horrible results if I try to move the controller at any kind of fast pace. The sphere on screen just sort of freaks out and jerks around trying to keep up, but definitely does not respond in a natural way.

I'm posting this here because my OpenCV/object tracking code seems to work, my issue seems to lie in finding a way to get the results from openCV to OpenGL in a format that is meaningful.

Am I taking this in the right direction? I can't help but think that some of my issues come from trying to relate differences in pixel locations to translations in OpenGL. I assume there's no way that I can relate my openCV coordinate system (0,0 in top left corner) to openGL and just draw the sphere at the correct coordinates automatically, right? If not, and translating is the only way to go, how should I be approaching this?

I hope this makes sense. I tried to break down the problem as much as I could without writing a book, heh.

Any help is appreciated.

I'm trying to relate both of them together so I can fully understand what's happening, but I'm having troubles doing so. If you look at the matrix in arcsynthesis' tutorial, he does (zFar + zNear) / (zNear - zFar) for the 3rd row of the 3rd column, and then he has -1.0f as the 3rd row of the 4th column. Which he also has (2 * zFar * zNear) / (zNear - zFar) on the 4th row of the 3rd column. I don't understand what these calculate/do, compared to the opengl-tutorial. Also what is Frustum Scale?

From what I so far understand, is that zNear and zFar are values that you can arbitrarily assign (zNear can't be 0, or else things will be infinitely bigger at the apex of the frustum) which allows you to see from and to these values of the frustum that is created. The rest completely just alienates me.

I like the idea of how the opengl-tutorial breaks the matrix into 3 categories, model, view and projection. If it's possible, I'd greatly appreciate if someone could explain arcsynthesis' tutorial in this manner.

I know how to implement this in programming, I also understand how to do matrix-vector multiplication and whatnot. Basically what baffles me is the terms and what the math calculates (I mean, (N + F) / (N - F) is not hard, but just that it doesn't explain to you what it actually is calculating, like Field of View or something)

I want to understand how to do this, I feel like using GLM is sort of... cheating, in a way. To just easily use the glm::lookAt function and not even worry about doing such mathematical equations without at least learning it and knowing what's happening under the hood.

Now, by default in OpenGL the NDC-space works the same but the clip space doesn't, from what I gather, here z extends from 1 (""near"") to -1 (""far"").

At the same time I want to ideally keep using the ""kinda-sorta inofficial quasi-standard"" matrix functions for lookat and perspective, currently defined as:

    func (me *Mat4) Lookat(eyePos, lookTarget, upVec *Vec3) {
    	l := lookTarget.Sub(eyePos)
    	l.Normalize()
    	s := l.Cross(upVec)
    	s.Normalize()
    	u := s.Cross(l)
    	me[0], me[4], me[8], me[12] = s.X, u.X, -l.X, -eyePos.X
    	me[1], me[5], me[9], me[13] = s.Y, u.Y, -l.Y, -eyePos.Y
    	me[2], me[6], me[10], me[14] = s.Z, u.Z, -l.Z, -eyePos.Z
    	me[3], me[7], me[11], me[15] = 0, 0, 0, 1
    }
    
    //	a: aspect ratio. n: near-plane. f: far-plane.
    func (me *Mat4) Perspective(fovY, a, n, f float64) {
    	s := 1 / math.Tan(DegToRad(fovY)/2) // scaling
    	me[0], me[4], me[8], me[12] = s/a, 0, 0, 0
    	me[1], me[5], me[9], me[13] = 0, s, 0, 0
    	me[2], me[6], me[10], me[14] = 0, 0, (f+n)/(n-f), (2*f*n)/(n-f)
    	me[3], me[7], me[11], me[15] = 0, 0, -1, 0
    }

So, for the lookat-part to have my world-space camera (positive-Z) work with lookat (negative-Z) as per this pseudocode:

    // world-space position:
    camPos := cam.Pos 
    // normalized direction-vector, up/right/forward are 1 not -1:
    camTarget := cam.Dir
    // lookat-target:
    camTarget.Add(&amp;camPos)
    // invert both Z:
    camPos.Z, camTarget.Z = -camPos.Z, -camTarget.Z
    // compute lookat-matrix:
    cam.mat.Lookat(&amp;camPos, &amp;camTarget, &amp;Vec3{0, 1, 0})

That works well. Moving the camera in all 6 degrees of freedom produces correct on-screen movement and correct new camera world-space coords.

But geometry is still inverted on the Z-axis. When I position two boxes, A at (-2, 1, -2), to appear near-left and B (2, 1, 2) to appear far-right,  then A appears far-left and B appears near-right. Z is still inverted here.

Now, these nodes have their own world-space coords and update from those their own model-to-world matrices. I shouldn't invert posZ there as they form a hierarchy of sub-nodes multiplying with their parents transforms and all that. They're still in model or world space, which as per my decree is to remain left-handed.

Their world-to-camera calculation happens on the CPU at my end, not in a vertex shader which just gets a single final (mvp/clip-space) matrix.

When that happens -- multiplication of world-space-object-matrix with clip-space lookat-and-projection matrix -- at that point I need to somehow invert Z.

What's the best way to do this? Or, more generally speaking, what's a common way that works? Do I have to modify the projection to accept left-handed but output-to-GL right-handed? If so, how? And then wouldn't I also have to modify lookat? Is there a smart way to do all this without having to modify the somewhat-standard lookat/projection matrices while also keeping model-transform-matrices in left-handed coords?",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_19wnl4,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/19wnl4/ways_to_invert_zaxis_in_shaderbased_coreprofile/,

I'm still very new to this stuff, but I think it was interesting enough to share it with you. Perhaps someone interested in the same subject will find it interesting to look at :).

I decided to do it in a fragment shader instead of using OpenCL to have the graphics related functionality GLSL as a language offers and because I thought it would be generally easier to set up.

I expected that the loops and branches would have a huge impact on the performance, but it turned out to be as horrible as I expected. Still, I think the performance could be greatly improved, perhaps with insight by people who are more experienced with this kind of thing.

If I remove GL_DEPTH everything works fine. I remember now when I added it during my experiments. While testing I kept copying around the block I posted below so essentially I was spreading my own shit around.

***SUMMARY:*** My onboard Intel 82865g video adapter does not like depth buffers. Requesting one with GL_DEPTH causes glClearColor to be ignored and all primitives to be rendered red. 

***EDIT2:*** genpfault notices that I still don't know what I'm doing. I was using GL_DEPTH (0x1801) instead of GLUT_DEPTH (0x10). This appears to have enabled GLUT_INDEX by mistake. Indeed, providing GLUT_INDEX gives me the exact problem again.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE:

All of my colored primitives (in this case quads) are coming out red. There are a few posts about it on the internet but the only ""solved"" one says it's a graphics driver issue. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, and tried to tinker with any setting I could find but nothing brings other colors back. It is an Intel 82865g that plays Minecraft decently.

The funny thing is that it worked fine just a few weeks ago! I was experimenting with lighting and ever since then no matter what I do shapes are the same ugly shade of red in all of my development projects.

One site mentions that I've enabled something. THAT'S GREAT. I'm ok with that if anybody could possibly tell me what it is so I could disable it. If you say ""lighting"" please tell me if I have to disable GL_LIGHTING or some other thing like LIGHT0 etc. If you say ""texturing"" please tell me if there is something besides ""GL_TEXTURE_2D"" I'm supposed to consider.

I've written code with a point source for lighting elements. The problem that I'm having is that the shininess attribute of the material is doing nothing for my specular lighting (if its 10.0 or 200.0). I'm hoping to get some help regarding this issue. Below is a snippet of my vertex glsl file.


    /* First model transform */
    vPosition = uModelMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);
    /* Light Computations using position in world coordinates */
    vec4 light_vector = normalize(vec4(ulightPos.x, ulightPos.y, ulightPos.z, 0.0) - vPosition);
    vec4 Normalization = normalize(uModelMatrix * (vec4(aNorm.x, aNorm.y, aNorm.z, 0.0)));
    vec4 reflection = normalize(  (2.0 * (max(dot(light_vector, Normalization), 0.0)) * Normalization) - light_vector);

    /* dot_diff needs to be tested as specular lighting should ONLY occur when non-zero */
    dot_diff = dot(light_vector, Normalization);
    diffuse *= clamp(dot_diff, 0.0, 1.0); 

    /* Second model transform for position in camera space since specular lighting relies on where the person is viewing from. In our case. */
    vPosition = uViewMatrix* vPosition;

    gl_Position = uProjMatrix*vPosition;
    gl_FrontColor = vec4(aColor.r, aColor.g, aColor.b, 1.0);

    /* Check to see if we even have specular lighting. If so, do calculation. If not, specular is 0, 0, 0 */
    if(dot_diff &gt; 0.0)
        specular *= clamp(pow(max(0.0, dot(vPosition, -reflection)), shininess), 0.0, 1.0);  
    else
        specular = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);

    /* Output */
    vColor = (diffuse + specular + ambient);

Here are what the variables are that I've defined and are used in this snippet of code.

    /* Global */
    attribute vec3 aPosition;
    attribute vec3 aNorm;
    attribute vec3 aColor;
    varying vec3 vColor;
    varying vec4 vPosition;
    uniform mat4 uProjMatrix;
    uniform mat4 uViewMatrix;
    uniform mat4 uModelMatrix;
    uniform vec3 ulightPos;

    /* Local for this instance */
    vec3 ambient = vec3(.2, .2, .2);
    vec3 diffuse = vec3(0.0, 0.08, 0.5);
    vec3 specular = vec3(.4, .4, .4);
    float shininess = 200.0;

Any information with regards to what I'm doing wrong would help! Lighting *does* work, it's just the specular is not really changing with the shininess value (rather, the difference between 1.0 and 200.0 is marginal)!

If more information is needed, I'll be happy to supply it. I can post screen shots later if necessary.

Can someone outline how I should approach this?

This is what I have so far.

1) Develop OOP classes for Particle,ParticleSystem,etc which simulate an explosion. (will not contain a drawing code, will simply ""displace"" the x,y,z coordinates per time unit) They will also have properties like color,size, velocity, etc

2) Develop a rendering engine, that loops and renders these Particles using the latest values...

I've no clue about the Motion Blur. Any help/links to tutorials/projects is appreciated.

You can render it to textures (with alpha!), send input events and even do interaction with javascript. It's pretty cool! Because I wanted to have mouse interaction on any arbitrary surface I'm using a framebuffer to render texture coordinates to RGB so I can determine the mouse position within the virtual window. This seems to work great.

The issue I'm having is that the glReadPixels() call I'm doing to get the color value under the mouse is maxing out a full CPU core. If I don't do the pixel read I get only about 2% CPU usage. I do not get a framerate hit from this CPU usage. With glReadPixels() disabled or enabled I get about 1550FPS. I've read that this might happen because the CPU has to convert the pixel format but both my render buffer and my glReadPixels() call are using GL_RGBA and I'm only reading a single pixel. Is it happening because glReadPixels() has to wait for the GPU to finish drawing? But why is the CPU maxed out when I'm vsync'ed to 60FPS and it can handle 1550FPS?

Code formatting isn't working for me so I'll give you some line numbers in my barebones experiment:
https://github.com/ThomasColliers/glexp-gui/blob/master/gui.cpp

Setup of the framebuffer at line 67

Line that causes CPU to become maxed out at line 246

I'm also having minor accuracy issues since I'm limited to 255 values for the mouse coordinates. I assume that I should be able to fix this by using a higher resolution color buffer? Right now I'm also using another color attachment for identification of the right ""window""/object. I'm probably just going to use 2 color channels for the texture coordinate and 1 color channel for identification in a single color attachment.

Using this method I would generate the VBOs where I initialise the geometry data and group them by the textures the elements using the VBOs use so as to avoid too much binding/unbinding textures to video memory. This morning however I am wondering if it wouldn't be more effective to rebuild the VBO every time the vertices required for rendering change and just store it in a single VBO.

Each file has a texture that's shown in a view pane, overlapping other files (this is oversimplified, but I can't explain much more without explaining what the product is). There can be over a hundred files being shown. If it's relevant, this is within a QtGLWidget.

At a certain point, this gets extremely slow. I know I can get the maximum number of allowed textures using glGet with GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS_ARB, but my work computer shows 96 for that value and I'm able to view more than 96 files.

I have two questions:
* Is GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS_ARB the maximum number of textures that the graphics card can render? (I think it is, but want to make sure!)
* What happens if you have more textures than the maximum number? Do they all get rendered? If not, which ones aren't shown?



EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! It turned out that GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS applies to multitexturing whereas the rendering code I'm working with was rendering a bunch of quads, one texture per quad. So the constant doesn't apply.

There are two ways we could interpolate between two vec4 values: (1) just interpolate each component, (2) consider them as vec3 values in homogeneous form, convert to vec3, interpolate, and convert back.

I think it's pretty obvious that (1) is what is done with varying vec4 variables. But I've found lots of code that seems to assume (2) is the method used.

In particular, if we store an RGBA color in a vec4, then (1) is the correct method. But if we store a 3D position in a vec4 in homogeneous form, and then expect it to be interpolated correctly, we are on thin ice.** But lots of people do this. Google ""varying vec4"", and you'll quickly see what I mean.

So, I figure those people are just messed up.

HOWEVER.

There is a varying vec4 position that is a built-in: gl_TexCoord[]. Yes, I know it's deprecated, but it's still there. How can this possibly be interpolated correctly? Does GLSL magically know whether you're using a varying vec4 to store a color vs. a position, and then it chooses between the two interpolation methods? That doesn't seem possible. And yet, glTexCoord is there, staring me in the face. Apparently the designers of GLSL thought it would be interpolated correctly. (And even if I don't want to use gl_TexCoord, all the advice out there -- google it -- tells me to make my own varying vec4, which will still be interpolated incorrectly, right?)

Can someone please explain?

--------

**EDIT: To illustrate the problem:

Say I have two points: (1, 1, 1) and (3, 3, 3). Halfway between these two should be (2, 2, 2).

If I store them in homogeneous form as (1, 1, 1, 1) and (3, 3, 3, 1), then halfway between is (2, 2, 2, 1), which gives the right answer.

However, any positive 4th coordinate is legal in homogeneous form; I could represent (1, 1, 1) as (101, 101, 101, 101). Interpolating using method (1) halfway between that and (3, 3, 3, 1), I get (52, 52, 52, 51), which converts back to 3D as (52/51, 52/51, 52/51), or about (1.02, 1.02, 1.02), which is not at all close to the correct value of (2, 2, 2).",,False,,t5_2qzvf,True,,,True,t3_kplze,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/kplze/varying_vec4_in_glsl/,

I'm working on a custom graphics engine for a game I'm working on.
Recently, I stopped using gl_Vertex/gl_Normal/etc and have been using vertex attributes.
Unfortunately, this also means I can't pass data directly as I used to do with client states (mostly for small 2D stuff like text), so I have to create VBOs for each render call.

Anyway, the issue lies in the following (which I call after finishing the frame and calling SwapBuffers):

//! Destroy temporary VBOs

//glDeleteBuffers(Nux_EngineInfo.TempVBOCnt, Nux_EngineInfo.TempVBO); //! Does NOT work

for(Nux_u32 i=0;i&lt;Nux_EngineInfo.TempVBOCnt;i++) glDeleteBuffers(1, &amp;Nux_EngineInfo.TempVBO[i]); //! Works fine

Nux_EngineInfo.TempVBOCnt is simply 'unsigned int', and Nux_EngineInfo.TempVBO is 'unsigned int*' and dynamically allocated each frame, so it's not because the memory isn't linear.

I also know I'm not reading past the end of the array or anything because if I was, the loop also wouldn't work (that, and the array is manually resized when out of space).

Anyone got any ideas? While I don't mind the loop there, it'd be a lot better if I didn't have to use it.

Currently trying to render some light cone volumes for vehicle headlights, but from an angle where the two light volumes overlap, there seems to be some kind of weird face culling problem. Could be something else, but I can't seem to figure it out. Pictures are worth a thousand words, so here is an image of the mesh in Blender (vertex normals shown in blue):

http://imgur.com/IYOhmYg

Now, when I try to render this in my homebrew OpenGL engine, strange lines appear where the meshes overlap. The light volumes are rendered using a simple shader which basically just outputs the color in the texture (after the main geometry is drawn). This is what it looks like:

http://imgur.com/94mxqN5

The rendering is done using:


    glEnable(GL_BLEND);
    glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE);

    glCullFace(GL_BACK);
    glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);

    glDepthMask(GL_FALSE); // EDIT: Disable depth buffer writing. This fixes the problem.

    // Setup shader and render meshes

    glDisable(GL_CULL_FACE);
    glDisable(GL_BLEND);
    glDepthMask(GL_TRUE); // EDIT: Re-enable depth writing

Does anybody know how to explain this? Is it because the mesh is rendered as a single piece, and would depth sorting be required?

After I got everything working, I decided to experiment a little. I moved the top vertices coordinates around and added texture coordinates to each vertex (mapped the 4 vertices to the 4 corners of the texture). I was expecting the texture to just be squished around the top part, but instead I got this: http://imgur.com/cQrDMrd

So I poked around a little and found out that this is a common problem when mapping textures to trapezoids. I understand why this is happening, and I also understand that people usually solve this problem like this: http://home.xyzw.us/~cass/qcoord/

It seems odd to me that anyone would want to fix this problem by adding perspective to the texture that is being mapped on the trapezoid. I can think of specific situations where I'd probably want to do that, but in general, I find it odd that the ""accepted"" solution to this problem is to give depth to the texture, as this would probably look out of place in a 2d game where nothing else has that kind of depth.

What I'd like to be able to do is to stretch the texture: http://i.stack.imgur.com/V2KCQ.jpg

I've browsed around and tried to find a way of doing this, but I just can't seem to find a solution that'd work for any ""irregular"" quad. The solutions I've found all seem to only work for very specific cases, or to still give some perspective to the texture (although not as much).

I'm trying to go through the tutorials over at open.gl but I'm stuck due to my application only allowing version 120 of GLSL shaders. When I go higher it just simply says that it's not support even though the things I read online tell me that my AMD Readon HD 6770M should be able to support OpenGL 4.0 (Mac OSX only supports 3.2, [reference](https://developer.apple.com/graphicsimaging/opengl/capabilities/)) but it's always stuck at 1.2 and the shaders just won't allow me to go any higher.

What do I have to do to get these version 150 shaders to work? 

Edit:

Solved! Big thanks to /u/kimixa for pointing out the problem. Apparently I forgot to set the SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK in order to force OpenGL to create a 3.2 context.

Right now before I create my SDL_Window I have these lines of code:

    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 3);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION, 2);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_CORE);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_ACCELERATED_VISUAL, 1);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER, 1);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 24);

I've been interested in learning OpenGL for ages, as I study Computer Science, and feel that it would not only be a great learning experience, but would also be fun, and allow me to develop my skills in different areas!

I've downloaded Code Blocks with Mingw, I downloaded Premake 4 as instructed, I added it to my Enviroment Variable, and used it to generate the project files for Code Blocks using ""premake4 codeblocks"".

I also used premake4 to build the glsdk and loaded the generated project into my workspace in Code Blocks.

Now, when I build the tutorial, it builds fine. But when I go to run it, I get a load of errors I have no clue how to fix.. Ive tried switching about the compiler but that still results in the same errors:

ld.exe: cannot find -lglimgD
ld.exe: cannot find -lglutilD
ld.exe: cannot find -lglmeshD
ld.exe: cannot find -lfreeglutD

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place, but I've tried several times in the past to get started learning OpenGL, and everytime, I seem to hit a snag in the setting up.. and I never actually manage to follow the tutorial, since I can't get it to run!

I've been fleshing out some shaders, but am confused about clamping the light values (if/when to do it). Here's where I'm confused:

The standard lighting equation is basically (written for simplicity):

    globalAmbient*materialColor + (for each light: attenuation*(ambient + diffuse + specularity))

With a global ambient of... say .2, and a directional light fully illuminating a surface (surface normal dot dirToLight = 1.0), that brings us to a light value of 1.2. This value will blow out the color though (since it's &gt; 1.0). I used to clamp the final light calculated light value from 0..1, but of course this pretty much kills specularity (which has to be able to ""blow out"" a color). 

So my question is, when should I clamp lighting values? Is it normal that a global ambient + fully lit surface will get blown out (i.e. I shouldn't clamp)? Or, maybe I should clamp total ambient+diffuse, then add in specularity? I know that I can achieve some effects depending on this, but I'm more curious as to what the standard is.

Soliciting an opinion on which of these two methods is better. Here's the stripped down render loop:

* GameLoop() is repeated at maximum speed
* update() handles input, moves all entities, and sweeps up
* draw() is almost entirely OpenGL calls, beginning with glClear()
* glutSwappBuffers() will be familiar to everyone

Hopefully this all comes out formatted right:

**Separate update/draw**

    void GameLoop()
    {
        ticks now = getticks();
        
        if(m_updateNeeded)
        {
            m_state-&gt;update();
            m_updateNeeded = false;
        }
        
        if(elapsed(now, m_lastFrame) &gt; m_animationInterval)
        {
            m_lastFrame = now;
            m_updateNeeded = true;
            
            m_state-&gt;draw();
            glutSwapBuffers();
        }
    }

**Update/draw together**

    void GameLoop()
    {
        ticks now = getticks();
        
        if(m_updateNeeded)
        {
            m_state-&gt;update();
            m_state-&gt;draw();
            m_updateNeeded = false;
        }
        
        if(elapsed(now, m_lastFrame) &gt; m_animationInterval)
        {
            m_lastFrame = now;
            m_updateNeeded = true;
            
            glutSwapBuffers();
        }
    }

Both implementations run smoothly but profiling presents a different case. The CPU jumps up and down between 1% and about 18% in the first implementation, but between 1% and 42% in the second. This is obviously because the heavy lifting all gets grouped together in the second case, whereas it's more spread out in the first.

Anyway, I'm guessing the CPU usage averages out so that's not a big deal. The question is: is either method more efficient, more accurate, or just plain better?",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_v8nsg,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/v8nsg/render_loop_when_to_swap_buffers/,

Help!,Massena,4,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/ird6v/framerate_drops_when_sampling_too_many_textures/,"I'm trying to render some procedural terrain with diffuse, specular and bump mapping. I'm using two texture sets, one for rock and one for grass. So that's six textures I need to sample.

The weird thing is that when I use 1 to 5 textures it runs smoothly but if I sample six textures suddenly the framerate drops drastically (down to 1 fps).

So (in my fragment shader)

&gt;	vec4 test = texture2D(rock, tex_coord);

&gt;	test = texture2D(rock_spec, tex_coord);

&gt;	test = texture2D(rock_normal, tex_coord);

&gt;	test = texture2D(grass, tex_coord);

&gt;	test = texture2D(grass_spec, tex_coord);

&gt;	test = texture2D(grass_normal, tex_coord);

is amazingly slow, but if I comment out one of the lines it works just fine... How can I fix this? Is there something I'm missing? Can I cut down on the number of textures I'm sampling without losing the quality?

I'm using a full color texture for the specular, but I guess I could cut it down to grayscale and store in the alpha channel of some of the textures. But why can't I sample 6 textures when 5 works just fine?

UPDATE: Apparently the textures were just too big. I thought the GPU could handle 6 2048*2048 textures, but in hindsight that was pretty dumb.

I'm working on a OpenGL 3.2 engine for a little game I'm working on and I've got a issue with my matrix math.

Right now I'm using the glm library (a header only library) and sending the values of the matrix to the Vertex Shader. The problem is that if I have my target and eye pos both be at 0.0f on all axis it crashes. The crash is basically a assert to check if there is a greater difference then 0.0 because after that it divides the value by another value (also 0) which will cause a real crash.

I tried using the gluLookat method and requesting the matrix to send to the shader but there I just get a invalid operation error from OpenGL.

Is there a other library I should use or is there a way to make the gluLookat work?

Also when the Y pos goes from a negative to a positive the screen flips around, my up axis is Z 1.0",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_1hi0y7,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/1hi0y7/opengl_mathematics_glm_not_able_to_process_a/,

We've done a brief overview of Open GL and talked about the very basics. Along with that I've done a few tutorials online. They are very much 3D focused but I'm looking to build a 2D app. I understand that 2D isn't a problem, but I'd like to get some perspective on it before I commit and waste many hours going down the wrong route!
I originally thought I could build my game just using the canvas, and after much trial and error I figured out how to perform an additive blend and the image requirements, etc... I learnt LOADS so the time was well spent. But it turns out that additive blending is a very costly procedure and while it worked fine when applying additive blending without animation, my app slows to a crawl when I try additive blending at 30fps.
So I've conceded that if I really want the superb super-fancy graphics I'll need to use Open GL to do the additive blending. Otherwise I'll just have to use normal sprites without any fancy lighting effect.
So to my questions... (So far I'm using bitmaps).
When I lock OpenGL to 2D mode, can I just draw to the screen like you can with the canvas?
If not, how does it work? Do I need to make a surface on which to draw each sprite? For example, do I need to make a square then draw my bitmap on the square then use a new square for each sprite?
Does additive blending with OpenGL work in a similar way to additive blending on the canvas? (using greyscale images, colour filters, etc...)
Got any good tips or tutorials on additive blending in Open GL or 2D drawing in Open GL?
I'm sorry if this seems trivial, or if it looks like I haven't done enough research, but that's not the case; I've spent a lot of time looking into this without much success, and my project is due next week.
I didn't think additive blending would slow the game down so much, but then I played games like Repulze , SpeedX 3D and Catapult King and realised that it's my inability to program to a sufficiently high standard that's the issue :-D Any advice you can share would be greatly appreciated.

What have I done wrong? The data within the FBX is in pairs of 2 and each triangle has a UVmap index which it pulls from the loaded array.

Also this is a strip down of my code which is a temporary project. Once I've got everything working (and actually loading in the FBX from the file itself) I'll have re-written it into a c++ class.


Edit:

To those who may interrest it I have found the problem. The OBJ UV maps don't use position 0 as the start of their data.

I found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3697527/opengl-model-not-displaying-correctly-need-to-fix-draw-distance and the answer was that the vertices are outside the clipping plane, which is true, my vertices ARE outside of the clipping plane, but I don't know how to fix that.

I thought i could try to join you with a question :)


Fun story... A year ago I asked you how to do a thing, and you told me to go learn modern OpenGL, and I didn't. That costed me 7 weeks in a loony bin, a year off the school and $2000+ in expenses.

Now I'm going the sane way but hit a curb again: 

I'm drawing a surface made of adjacent triangles with several calls to glDrawElements:

    for I := 0 to Length(Ix) div self.Columns do
    begin
        glBindVertexArray(VAO);
        glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 2 * Columns, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, PGLvoid(I * 2 * Columns));
    glBindVertexArray(0);
    end;

I can't draw the whole surface in one go, because for each quad row I get an extra triangle [5-2-3](http://imgur.com/bg6cSA4.jpg). 
I decided to start a strip over for each row, but nothing changed.
Indices order is 0-3-1-4-2-5-3...

Is that supposed to work that way? How do I take the strip apart?

Currently I only have translations implemented which means translations can cause collisions but rotations cannot.  So here is my custom translation function which allows for collision detection: [**scTranslate()**](http://pastebin.com/8mEYSn0t).  'scTranslate' stands for ""Scene Translate"".  The variable of interest in **scTranslate()** is *obj_coord*.

.

Now if you look at **DrawCube()** again, you'll notice I don't do anything exciting when a collision occurs - I simply return out of the function. The ensuing cube which would result in a collision is not drawn. [The results look something like this (9 pic album).](http://imgur.com/7h5sN,BrSPd,AvcpA,hUJih,8fZS6,7klgx,GAqQw,BLu9M,aCswP) (In the pictures you are seeing a stationary vertical stack of cubes being ""hit"" my a moving group of cubes which are moving right to left.)

.

Now that you have the background information on my project, let me explain where the confusion sets in.  Before coding this, I imagined collisions would somehow be calculated *after* everything is drawn. Is that usually the case? With my current implementation, each time any object is drawn, it has to iterate through ALL previously drawn objects and find the difference in position.  This works surprisingly fast even when rendering thousands of cubes, but such an implementation is rudimentary and is bound to fail given a large/complex enough scene.
 
.

One way to avoid having to iterate through every object is to section objects into different areas so that each area will have roughly the same number of objects in them... but how do I accomplish this if I haven't drawn all the objects yet!? For example, which ""area"" would the very first cube I draw be placed into? Am I going about this wrong? Should physics be implemented separately from drawing operations?

.

Well that's all I've got for now, as I'm at work and I should be working. Thanks for reading the wall of text, and I look forward to a good discussion!",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_11bey0,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/11bey0/moving_past_rudimentary_collision_detection_ogl/,

I was wondering if it was possible to use different index arrays for vertices and texture coordinates / normals / .. when drawing with glDrawElements. (This is done on OpenGL ES 2.0)

The main motivation here is that in my specific case, tex coords are all one of (0 0, 1 0, 0 1, 1 1), which would lead to a lot of duplicate data if I needed to use the same indices for both, vertices and texture coordinates.

As far as I got, this breaks as soon as one binds a second GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, as only the last one is taken for all bound GL_ARRAY_BUFFERs.

Is there a different way to do stuff, instead of duplicating the data to be able to use one single index array or to merge them into one array?

I would expect to somehow use code similar to the following (with minor tweaks to fix the ""issue""):

    GLint vertex_location = [[_material shader] attribute: @""vertex""];
    glEnableVertexAttribArray (vertex_location);
    [vertex_buffer bind]; // GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
    [_vertex_indices bind]; // GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER

    [tex_coord_buffer bind]; // GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
    // problem here:
    [_tex_coord_indices bind]; // GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER

Hello! I am moderately experienced with 3d rendering from some XNA development. I decided that it was time to broaden my knowledge by learning Open GL. I'm picking up Open GL ES 2.0 for Android for fun. I tend to learn new frameworks and languages by setting a specific goal for myself which requires the use of that framework or language. This time, I've decided to make a simulation of a ball rolling on a surface using accelerometers.




**STRUCTURE**:




* *Vector*: I'm using the Java extension, [vecmath](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/j2se/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/forDevelopers/J3D_1_3_API/j3dapi/javax/vecmath/package-summary.html) for my base vector units (Colors, Positions, Normals, etc).




* *Vertex*: This class represents a single vertex of a given primitive. Information this holds is the Position of the vertex, the Color of the vertex, the Normal of the vertex, etc.




* *Primitive*: This class represents a single primitive of a given model. A primitive holds a buffer of Vertex objects and a GLEnum specifying the type of primitive (TRIANGLES, TRIANGLE_STRIP, TRIANGLE_FAN)




* *Model*: This class represents a complete model, which is an array of primitive objects and a 4x4 matrix representing the transformations to apply to the model.




**QUESTIONS**: 




* I understand the difference between DrawArray and DrawElements, but since I want to procedurally generate all of my geometry, what is the best way to generate an indices and minimum vertex array? For now I'm just using DrawArray on my vertex buffer for each model, but what I eventually want to do is have the indices and vertices arrays generated as the model is generated. The best way I can think of doing this is as follows: create a hashcode method in the Vertex class which returns a hash which is only unique on the Vertex's position, loop through the input vertex array (an unpruned array of vertices which may or may not have been reused), store the vertices in a hashmap as a key with an integer as the value which represents when the vertex was used (The current index iterating through the original array of vertices), then create a new indices and vertex array from the hashmap. Is this approach appropriate? I don't love the use of dynamic memory, but I can't think of a better way to generate these values.




* Are Draw calls really that expensive? I read that you should minimize the number of Draw calls you use throughout your rendering. Currently I call the Draw on every primitive in every model in a given scene. This is because for a model like a sphere, it isn't possible to represent it as a single primitive. (My spheres are composed of several triangle strips (mid sections), and two triangle fans (end caps)). I've read online that the number of primitives here CAN be reduced by using degenerate triangles, so should I do this instead of creating so many primitives?




* I heard that using the scale methods on a model matrix can cause issues if collision detection is necessary later on/ Is this true? And if so, why?




* I eventually want to create a crappy rip-off of Marble Blast Gold for Android (For free and for fun as a hobby). I can't think of any other way to do this without very expensive collision detection (OBB vs Sphere or Convex hull vs sphere), does anyone have any suggestions?

It's clipping to the full size of the window, not just the client area.

Any ideas?

Window class style is set to

Edit:

Turns out that, according to glViewport, this is intended behavior. It's setting it relative to the window position, not the client area position. To get it to actually behave, you need to either create a simple static control inside your window or do the scaling yourself.

glViewport specifies the affine transformation of x and y from normalized device coordinates to **window coordinates.** Let x nd y nd be normalized device coordinates. Then the window coordinates x w y w are computed as follows:

I'm using OpenGL to do 2D drawing, which has made searching for help more difficult.  Also I am very new to OpenGL, so I don't know the standard way things are done.

I am storing the r,g,b values for each pixel in a large matrix.

Each time I get a small sound segment, I process it and convert it to column of pixels.  Everything is shifted to the left 1 pixel, and the new line is put at the end.

Each time I redraw, I am looping through setting the color and drawing each pixel individually, which seems like a horribly inefficient way to do this.

Is there a better way to do this?  Is there some method for simply shifting a bunch of pixels over?",,False,,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,t3_e1z6g,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/e1z6g/opengl_question_on_drawing_large_numbers_of_pixels/,

I am a moderately experienced programmer who is interested in learning all of the basics of modern OpenGL. I have been completing the helpful and well-made tutorials at www.open.gl. There are a few aspects which I've had trouble with.

1. Has anyone else had an issue trying to **dynamically link the GLFW library**? I have been forced to link it statically due to a plethora of linker errors. I am using Windows 7 64-bit.

2. In regards to the GLM library, in what cases will **glm::perspective(***fovy,aspect,zNear,zFar***)** show a black screen? I have followed [the open.gl tutorial](http://www.open.gl/transformations) very closely, and I have compared [his final code](http://www.open.gl/content/code/c4_3d.txt) with mine several times - yet whenever I try and multiply the matrix that results from glm::perspective() by my own matrix - all I see is a black screen. It doesn't seem to matter if I do the multiplication within the vertex shader or in my main cpp file. I should also note that all I am drawing is a 6-point GL_TRIANGLES (so essentially a rectangle). All points exist on a single plane (the rectangle is ""2D"").

Even if my issues are too specific to warrant help, any general information or links to modern OpenGL tutorials (utilizing shader programs) would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT1: I can use a breakpoint to look at the contents of any matrix, but Visual Studio 2010 Express 'watches' matrices in a way that it can be confusing to decipher them. At any rate, glm::perspective seems to result in a matrix with valid data. I can post my actual code when I return home from work.

EDIT2: It is the next day and I have yet to post my code. Thank you so much for the replies thus far.

EDIT3: **Code has been posted!**

All of these files are in a work in progress - I simply supplied the current snapshot. The perspective matrix is not being factored-in in these examples, but it is clear to see where such a thing would take place.

 (The perspective matrix is calculated and stored into the variable 'projmat' in file [SmallOGL.cpp](http://pastebin.com/hua3GTjG) on line 87. The matrix would be then factored into [VertexShader.c](http://pastebin.com/L0z1vrPx) via a 'glUniformMatrix4fv()' call and multiplied by the other matrices.)

X-Plane currently runs in 32bit and 64bit and uses a plugin system to integrate any 3d party add-ons into the simulator.  Here is a link to the plugin SDK for X-Plane:

I am a non programmer and this is a very early inquiry into the possibility.  The X-plane 10 weather engine is very complex but graphically it lacks.
