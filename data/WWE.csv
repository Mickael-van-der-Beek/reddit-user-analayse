1370806840.0,101,self.WWE,1fzwsg,How I would book Punk upon return.,OtherOtie,116,15,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1fzwsg/how_i_would_book_punk_upon_return/,"Punk no-shows Payback, forcing Heyman to substitute Curtis Axel in against Jericho. The Chicago crowd is pissed, vying and chanting for CM Punk through the entire match. Axel pins Jericho after Heyman uses Punk's music again as a distraction. Crowd is PISSED. During Axel's celebration, Punk's music hits again. This time it's Punk. He hits the GTS on Axel and Heyman looks confused.

The next night on Raw, Punk expresses his dissatisfaction with Paul Heyman on the Highlight Reel. He says he had no right to speak for Punk these past few weeks, signing a contract with Jericho without even consulting him, and using his music for his own advantage. Heyman was never Punk's manager like Brock and now Curtis, he was his associate, and his friend. But he's disrespected their friendship by making this about himself. 

Heyman apologizes to Punk, saying he made a mistake and he was only acting in the best interest of the Best in the World. Punk reluctantly accepts Heyman's apology and they hug it out.

Over the next few weeks, Punk plays the heel, although not overtly doing anything to illicit a heel response. He continues to face babyfaces, teaming with Curtis Axel against Jericho and Triple H one night on Raw. Axel intentionally causes Punk to take the fall, and Heyman has to hold Punk back from hurting Axel.

Next week, Punk challenges Axel to a match. Heyman is in a frenzy, completely broken up by the tension within his stable. He begs Punk to call off the match, but Punk says this isn't about Heyman, it's about teaching Axel a lesson. Heyman assures Punk that he's making the wrong decision, but Punk won't have any of it. 

It's Punk vs. Axel in the main event of Raw. The match is back and forth, in Punk's favor. Heyman is at ringside, but isn't in anyone's corner, occasionally pleading with the two not to hurt each other and that they should be on the same page. Punk hits the GTS on Axel and goes for the cover, but Heyman breaks it up and causes a DQ for Punk. 

Punk and Heyman argue, and Punk gets on the microphone, cutting a brief promo about how he doesn't need Heyman anymore. Heyman still pleads with Punk, but he tells Heyman it's over, and his ""services"" are no longer required. Punk says he'll always be a Paul Heyman guy, but not like this.

Punk walks out on Heyman. It cuts to backstage, with Punk angrily leaving the building. Matt Striker tries to get an interview, but Punk blows him off. Suddenly, Axel hits him from behind. Paul Heyman is at his side: ""GET HIM AXEL! GET HIM!"" Axel completely incapacitates Punk, and the show fades to black with Axel and Heyman standing over him.

Next week, Heyman says that if CM Punk doesn't want to be a Paul Heyman guy anymore, then he will no longer receive any of the benefits of being a Paul Heyman guy. That means Punk is no longer off limits for his other clients, and Curtis Axel is going to show him how big a mistake Punk has truly made. At Money in the Bank, CM Punk will face Curtis Axel in a down and dirty street fight. 

It's Money in the Bank, the second to last match on the card. Punk and Axel have taken each other to the limit all over the arena. Finally, they return back to the ring, and Punk is about to put Axel to sleep in the middle of the mat. Heyman runs in and delivers a low blow to Punk, letting Axel go for the pin. Punk kicks out and knocks Axel out with a kick to the head. Punk runs after Heyman and catches him in the GTS, when suddenly...

[BROCK LESNAR! IT'S BROCK LESNAR!](http://youtu.be/YToXwtyqmjM)

Piss runs down Punk's leg. He drops Heyman from the GTS and arms himself with a kendo stick. Lesnar roars on the stage and marches down to the ring. Punk is swinging the stick, ""COME ON!"" Lesnar slides into the ring and Punk goes for the beatdown. Lesnar no-sells the shots, promptly catching Punk in a fireman's carry. F5!!! Heyman drags Axel's unconscious body over Punk's, and the ref pins... 1... 2... 3!

Curtis Axel has pinned CM Punk.

Heyman, Lesnar and Axel retreat down the ramp, CM Punk can barely get to his feet.

At Summerslam, it's CM Punk vs Brock Lesnar.

Last night was AMAZING!,mhardgrove,77,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1bzlln/we_are_awesome_revolution_lets_keep_this_going/,"I don't have a lot of time to write this out. I am an HUGE wrestling fan but over the years (I am 29), I have gone from watching wrestling every week and all PPVs, to watching sometimes and some PPVs, to watching Royal Rumble &amp; Wrestlemania.

Last night I was in attendance at RAW and it ALMOST topped the experience of Wrestlemania the night before (not an exaggeration). I have been to 2001 King of the Ring, 2002 Summerslam, Great American Bash 2008, 2008 Royal Rumble, &amp; now Wrestlemania 29 as well as the RAW after with the Fandango Humming and insane chants.

The main reason of what happened last night with the international crowd and tri-state crowd mixed was because WWEs products over the last few years has gotten extremely complacent.

Last night we made a statement, if WWE wouldn’t entertain us we would entertain ourselves. I want to start a wrestling community and I have purchased www.WeAreAwesomeRevolution.com to do so. There is NOTHING now but I would like to build up a FREE, community-driven community. A line of direct feedback to Vince McMahon and everyone else in WWE like we did LIVE last night. Who is with me and what can we do? Who can help?",,False,self,t5_2rau9,False,,,True,t3_1bzlln,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1bzlln/we_are_awesome_revolution_lets_keep_this_going/,

1368485268.0,43,self.WWE,1e9xq5,Ever want to re-watch the Attitude era without downloading a torrent?,GrapeRello,46,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1e9xq5/ever_want_to_rewatch_the_attitude_era_without/,"So I grew up as a kid watching WWF during the attitude era, recently tried getting back into wrestling but it sucks. So what I did was go to [dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/us). Its a smaller youtube for whoever isn't familiar with dailymotion. 

I started watching from 99 and am currently in March of 2000. I have watched all the Raw, Smackdowns, and major PPVs. Just type in Raw or Smackdown followed by the date separated by periods. 
Example: (Raw 3.13.00). From there click 'list options' and the 'playlist' It should bring you to a playlist of the event by a username of ""INYOURHOUSE97"". That person has almost every event from the attitude era.

[Here is an example of the episode im on](http://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/x18tef_inyourhouse97_smackdown-3-16-00/1#video=xcbuui)

Some of the events have one or two parts missing due to a copyright issue. But most events don't have any missing parts. I have been doing this for a few months and find rewatching my childhood is much better than the crap WWE puts out nowadays.

Did anyone else notice that when Rock addressed Punk on Raw this past Monday, Punk was sitting in a sky box, forcing the Rock to look up, and in the direction of ""The Heavens""? This, of course, making Punk ""God"" in this little symbolic universe. I immediately realized it while watching Raw, but I've been decently busy and haven't had the chance to post. Just curious to see if anyone else picked up on it, and if you guys (and girls?) feel as though it was intentionally done that way, or just happened to fall together like that.

P.S. My first post in this subreddit. :D ~~CheapPopsAndKarma?~~

Edit: Forgot to type a major part of my post. Like an idiot. -1

I'm an indie game developer and a friend of mine and myself decided that we miss the good old days of wrestling games that had more of an arcade feel. Games like WCW/NWO Revenge and WWF No Mercy both for the n64. I still think that these and the first couple of the PSX SmackDown games are the best wrestling games around.

So, we decided that we're going to try and emulate the N64 games, update them with more modern graphics, and add what we think was missing back in the day.

I've got my own personal preferences on what I think would add greatness to those games, but I wanted to get the feedback from what the wrestling community had to say.

What features, abilities, game modes would YOU like to see in a potential wrestling game? What stuff from the WCW/NWO and No Mercy games didn't you like which we should stay clear from?

Our initial plan is to build a decent demo, show what we're thinking, then run a kickstart campaign to get further funding for the finished thing. We're initially looking to build for PC, OS X and Linux (probably only Ubuntu at the moment).",,False,self,t5_2rau9,False,,,True,t3_1coajf,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1coajf/what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a_wrestling_game/,

They can't just have him turn heel like Randy Orton or CM Punk would, though, because the kiddies love him, and that's a big fucking deal.

So, instead, by keeping Cena EXACTLY the same, they've created a perfect character.  Think about it: A self-aware company man, adored by children and more superficial fans, and despised by the more cynical and ""old-school"" fans.  He is face and heel wrapped up in one shtick.  Just by playing the same character he has for 10 years, he generates more heat AND more pop than any other superstar.

By keeping Cena as he is, WWE gets to milk him as a face and gives stars like Daniel Bryan, who, even if they turn heel, will still be cheered and loved by a significant chunk of the audience, simply because they're not Cena.  So the tickets are sold to the shows through Cena, and the rest of us are kept happy by giving us matches involving CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, Kane, Jericho, and many others.  Besides, if Cena turns heel, who are we going to bitch about?

I may be wrong, but I think it's at least an interesting angle of thought to pursue.  Any thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2rau9,False,,,True,t3_1jxff6,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1jxff6/why_cena_is_already_the_best_heel_the_wwe_has/,

It seems like the match was made to let Punk down from the top gently, but I really hope it's been made to blast Punk through the stratosphere, and is maybe Taker's way of handing the torch over.

Lawler's family members are with him, including son and former WWE performer Brian Christopher Lawler, who released a statement Tuesday evening concerning his father's condition. Though stable, the concern now is whether he suffered brain damage following the heart attack.

His message reads: “Ok, here’s the latest real update. Lauren and I are here at the hospital in Montreal. He does not look good at all. He is responsive to questions that he is asked which is very good. His sedation and breathing support are being lowered slowly right now. He was shocked a total of 7 times at the arena and underwent a balloon stint to open up a clogged artery when he arrived at hospital. Everyone out there needs to say a special prayer for his brain at this point, please. Tests on his brain will not be available until the morning. One of us two will keep all you guys informed as we know more.”

Stacy Carter, Lawler's former wife, remains optimistic on ""The King."" She tweeted late Tuesday night, ""Gonna try to get some sleep. Been a long 24 plus hours.

http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_68806.shtml

By Wade Keller, PWTorch editor

Two former WWE writers have told PWTorch what they think Vince McMahon will do with Jack Swagger now that he's made headlines for a DUI and pot possession arrest.

Former WWE creative team member Court Bauer (@courtbauer) tells me this afternoon he wouldn't trust Jack Swagger again.

""Irresponsible and immature,"" he told me a few minutes ago. ""I wouldn't trust Swagger again, frankly. What a stupid, stupid move by Swagger. This is RVD allll over again. I remember that situation quite clear and what the options and sentiment were as a result. WWE has 3 options: 1- Stay the course; 2- Reboot + replace Swagger; 3- Abort angle.

""I'm curious to see which way they go. I think they can salvage this and find an even better talent to build this around. I've heard Vince LOVES the concept and has been more focussed on this than 80 percent of the WWE creative since it started. He's going to likely opt for option 1 or 2. I am DYING to see what goes down.""

Another ex-WWE writer who opted to remain anonymous chimed in via email with similar thoughts. He wrote:

""That's so unfortunate. It's a good thing Zeb Coulter was getting all the heat anyways. I don't know what they do. Either keep his spot if they don't like other options or somehow they get them to wrestle sooner and put someone else in the role at Mania. Orton? Henry? Regardless it's more fuel for anyone opposed to pushing him.""

Bauer concurs that having Swagger wrestle sooner than WrestleMania would be the way to get him the World Title shot he earned by winning the Elimination Chamber, but punish him by excluding him from the WrestleMania line-up.

I suggested perhaps Chris Hero get brought in to replace Swagger, since Hero is a veteran who has paid dues in developmental and the indies scene for years.

Bauer said: ""Hero is a good option. Bray Wyatt or Luke Harper might be more 'authentic.' Harper still isn't ready for the bright lights and Bray may not fit the criteria for the super push. Hero might be able to adjust and project that type of persona. The hillbilly beard certainly helps.

""If this was up to me, I'd hot shot the Del Rio-Swagger match and put it on Raw, and put Del Rio over strong. Swagger fades out of picture… Then Dutch calls for reinforcements and out comes one of the above and that guy does the BIG heat angle that sets this thing on fire. He demolishes Del Rio, Rodriguez… maybe send out Rey &amp; Sin Cara and more of the same. They cut a promo saying 'Wrestler X' is the man behind the movement and this was all a trap. They then finally take this from being a straight-laced political stance to a dialed up wrestling warped POV on an issue and make it something controversial (instead of just a relatively sterile political perspective).

""They go for the jugular and get some real (cheap) Tennessee heat on this bad boy and Del Rio suffers a big injury. The next week Del Rio demands a fight with the new guy and the new guy refuses unless he has it at WM - the #1 media market so he can spread his message and he wants the belt. Del Rio accepts and they build him as a fighting champion - even when severely injured going into WM. That sets up a plausible finish that keeps Del Rio on good footing despite losing at WM. You could still insert Swagger as a Mr. Hughes/Diesel heater where he doesn't have to talk and can get physical and yet be completely disposable down the road.""

The other ex-writer says: ""Developmental would be the way to go if it didn't involve a World Title or WrestleMania. No way Vince gives a fresh guy that spot. They may just go forward with it and deal with his consequences after Mania and have Zeb recruit someone else who can 'get the job done'.""

In our PWTorch website and app poll, with over 500 votes already in just a half hour, 43 percent voted for ""Stay the Course, but he's on probation."" The rest - 57 percent - want him to be demoted or fired, but are split on whether to do it right away or wait until after WrestleMania. Second place was ""Demote him or fire him post-WM29"" with 34 percent, followed by ""Fire him now"" in third place at 23 percent.

I’m focusing on the active roster, so I’m not counting guys who are “part timers” (HHH, ‘Taker, Lesner) or guys we haven’t seen in forever (Evan Bourne, Ezekiel Jackson, Rey Mysterio). It’s hard to figure out their place in the mix when you don’t know how they’ll be reintroduced.
  
My terminology:  
**MAIN EVENTER** – A top guy, someone who could conceivably wear the WWE or World Championship.  
**UPPER MIDCARD** – Anybody who could conceivably feud with a Main Eventer, but would probably not wear a top belt (unless as a transitional champion). Could be a Main Eventer on his way down, or a Midcard guy on his way up.  
**MIDCARD** – The masses trying to prove themselves.  
**UNDERCARD** – Lost the 3rd match at a house show in Crossville, Tennessee.

While his best friend Edge goes on to be an 11 time world champion, he is left behind even though he is, in my opinion, just as good a wrestler as Edge. I know Christian went to TNA for some years where he was much more successful, but i feel that he should be given more opportunities in the WWE. Pretty much since after the Brood christian has lived in the shadows of Edge.

I was SO happy to see Christian FINALLY win a world championship back in 2011, and you can see how genuinely happy he was to finally get to the top. It should not have taken him 9 years to get their (minus the 4 from TNA). 

IDK about you guys, but the Christian-Orton feud a few years back was pretty awesome, and the matches they had at Summerslam and Over the Limit really show how capable Christian is, and I feel he should have been a main event guy like Edge since the Brood.

I feel pretty much the same about Kane aswell. They've both put in well over a decade into the business and both have very little to show for it (world title wise).

I want to see the Rock take Cena down, and take him down hard, at WM29.  I want this to cause Cena to seriously (and publicly) question his own ability, causing a spiral where he loses every goddamn match he's in for about three months.  Cena starts to get desperate and finally snaps, going completely ape-shit on someone like Big Show or Mark Henry, who just fucking destroys him.  Cena is out for two months, during which time the WWE takes a moment to shift some key players into their new roles for what is to come.  Two months later, at a Pay-Per-View, during an important match (let's say WH title, or even the WWE Title), John Cena's new music hits and, FINALLY, John Cena has come back...as a heel.  I want to see him come in with a chair and just decimate the two combatants, ending in a DQ, and establishing his role as a bona-fide heel for a while.  

I fully understand that this is NEVER going to happen, but I want it to.  Anyone else have any fantasy storylines involving SuperCena and a heel turn?",,False,self,t5_2rau9,False,,,True,t3_1b6892,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1b6892/i_want_it_to_happen/,

I would've preferred Punk in the title match as a triple threat just because it sucks that Rock gets the belt and now it's going to Cena blah blah blah etc etc etc.

 Anywho, I think I read on prowrestling.com a few weeks back about the first time that Paul Bearer was introduced to CM Punk by Undertaker, and how the Undertaker was talking to guys like Big Show backstage and whatnot, and then saw Punk walking and was like ""oh wait, Punk, come here. Paul, let me introduce you to Punk. He's one of us."" Which in the article, Paul Bearer attested to being a huge amount of respect being shown from Taker to Punk.

 With that in hindsight, I think I like that Punk and Taker are fighting at Mania. It adds backstage context that both Punk and Taker want this to happen, and that Taker respects Punk for what he's accomplished (and obviously vice versa). 

 And now add in what happened last night, it adds SO MUCH more fuel to the fire between them. This match has been set for 8 days and it already has more fuel than the ""End of an Era"" match last year. I honestly can't wait to see how it plays out. Thoughts?

I'll show you some chaos. ""Oh yeah and i've got some friends who are reeeally mad at you to. Question is.....Are you ready?"" Spotlight to the top of the stairs. It's Christian. Spotlight to the other stairs. It's Ryback. Other Stairs. It's Big Show. Slowly you realize, every person Shield has ever power bombed or fucked with is coming from all directions for payback.

Michael Cole shouts ""Vintage Owen Hart"". GONG. Ring goes dark. A coffin appears. It opens. Crackhead Jake the Snake pops out and he throws a snake in the ring. The snake is wearing a bunch of DX merch, mostly those armbands. The Shield is scared, they jump up on the turnbuckles, seeing as how by now the ring is surrounded and they have nowhere to go. BOOM, Kane's pyro hits, lighting everyone's ass on fire. DX slime drops from the ceiling putting everyone's ass fires out. Sin Cara starts coming down the ramp, but he botches it, trips, knocks his head, he's out. Camera pans to Ziggler, ""I could have sold that better"".

All the days of being the first table destroyed in a pay per view are over motherfuckers. It's wearing Del Rio's scarf and it's chomping at the bit to get to Shield as well. Rikishi is there too, but he's limping. He goes to triple H, triple H pulls a sledgehammer out of Rikishi's asshole, yells at Shield ""It's a shithammer now you motherfuckers! Watch out"" Everyone jumps into the ring at once, hits all their finishers, whoops ass. All Shield members are bleeding like a thankful 17 year old after a pregnancy scare. They're crying harder than Adele handcuffed to a treadmill. They all get knocked out. All the wrestlers go back to the locker room ""Hey where was Benoit?"" ""He said he had to go home to take care of family problems or something i don't know"". Shield is still lying in the ring unconscious. Cage drops down, padlocked from the outside. Wait who is that in there with them? Oh shit it's Mark Henry and Goldust. Mark Henry yells ""SEXUAL CHOCOLATE!!!"" Goldust smiles that smile Arnold got every time he realized his wife left him home alone with the maid. Lights go out. Screams.

Many people are predicting that Kane will square off against Bray Wyatt at SummerSlam. This is indeed a safe bet to predict, but I expect their to be a twist. A match against these two should have a stipulation to add interest. If Bray Wyatt wins then Kane should be forced to ""follow the buzzards"". If this happens then this is when the twist will occur. The main event is the WWE Champion John Cena versus Daniel Bryan for the title. Predicting a winner is 50/50. If Bryan comes out on top expect Kane to then approach the ring. He will come dressed in different clothing and a cover for his face so no one can tell who it is. While Bryan is celebrating, the big red machine will attack his ""best friend"" resulting in a Randy Orton cash-in for the WWE Championship. After Kane reveals himself, he will no longer be wearing his mask. By ""following the buzzars"" Kane will become a heel in the WWE. This is a great idea because it spices up his character with a new gimmick. Since Kane is 46 years old and been in the buisness for 20+  years, the WWE Universe needs to witness something extreme and unpredictable. The prediction I just made may not even come close to happening, but I feel like it will be a hit and refresh the story line between Bryan, Kane, and Orton since they have teamed up multiple times this past year against The Shield. Expect a twist to occur during SummerSlam, but I think my prediction and theory would best be suited for each of the superstars involved.

Obviously, it was pretty cool getting to talk online to people about wrestling, but slowly, it has gotten pretty annoying. 
The biggest issue I have with being a wrestling fan is just how hard it is to actually talk about the sport. I don't have many friends who actually like wrestling, so most of the time, I turn to the internet for my fix. However, it feels I can't even post an opinion without being attacked. My favorite wrestler is CM Punk. Has been since 2009. And yet any time I mention that, I hear:
1) About how skinny he is, despite the fact that he has martial arts training and is great at his craft.
2) How he is a ratings killer, despite the fact that his segments usually gain ratings.
3) How I'm just on his bandwagon because he breaks kayfabe. 
It isn't even just about Punk. If I say ""Swagger shouldn't be punished,"" I'm called an idiot. Say the Undertaker's streak should end? Guess I'm not a **true** wrestling fan. Not a fan of the Rock as WWE champ? Just an ignorant mark. 
I mean, why the hell are wrestling fans so damn opinionated to the point of mocking anyone who doesn't share their opinion?

I was big into WWF when I was a kid.  Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Tatanka, Crush, Bret Hart, Shawn Micheals, the list could go on forever.  I took a break in my early teens but was pulled back in during the attitude era and I started watching some WcW as well.  Great characters and a lot of fun.

Now, I just recently came back and started watching at SummerSlam.  Things have changed significantly over the probably ten years I was not watching.  I have gone back and checked out some of the PPV's and raw/smackdowns through the past year, and although I am still enjoying the greatest spectacle on earth, I have a couple questions.

1. Why is Cena always referred to as the most ""polarizing superstar""? and has he actually won that many titles? I have done some reading on him out of the ring and he seems like a real stand up guy.  Why do people boo him and chant ""you can't wrestle"".

2. CM Punk is supposed to be a heel now right? but, him and some of the other ""heels"" still get positive crowd reactions.  This confuses me because I remember the heel being hated and booed, and the face getting the big pops and applause.

3. Why are there two heavy weight belts and which is the top belt? what CM Punk has?

4. What happened to the Tag division? Prime time players have a good character and Kane and Brian could be great, but the others really seem pretty lame.

5.  Are they trying to be more safe? seems like a lot of the finishers and big moves don't look as dangerous anymore.

6.  Is it worth it to check out the other wrestling companies? Are they all under the WWE banner now?

7.  Finally, If anyone would be so kind as to recommend the most ""much watch"" ppv event in the last couple of years, I would be grateful.

I realize that is a lot to answer, but I appreciate it! Thanks!

Edit: Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer my many questions.  I feel much more informed now.  I wasn't aware of a lot of what people mentioned, like the wellness policy.  I will begin my hunt for some older DVDs, starting with money in the bank 2011.",,False,self,t5_2rau9,1347978292.0,,,True,t3_1026mm,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1026mm/back_to_into_wrestling_after_a_long_break_couple/,

I expected Sheamus to handly defeat Cesaro, but they let Cesaro really roll in this match. They really showed him off and talked him up, he probably outshined Sheamus overall throughout the match. Even though Sheamus picked up the win, the count-out saved some face and nobody really expected Sheamus to job this out, US Champion or not.

But now that this rumor has bumbled up, it's perfect. Provided Taker is healthy enough to really put on a show, this would be the match of the night. Takers' matches have overshadowed the title match the last three times. It's pretty much a legend maker at this point. Even with the obvious loss, it puts CM Punk into that upper stratosphere of legendary superstars almost automatically.

What do you do when you loose the title after a year long run? The normal answer would be take a break, but CM Punk is still fresh, there's no reason to take him off TV. He gets this one rematch but you know it's gonna be Cena vs Rock at WM. So what does Punk do? Where's there a feud?

Punk vs Taker would be as big as the main event. Even with the loss, he can say he walked out of WM on his own leg, which HHH and HBK couldn't do.

Oh, and so the match doesn't come out of nowhere, how about this for wrapping it all together? During CM Punk vs Rock, the lights go out again - except this time, when they go on, The Shield and CM Punk are laid out and you get the signature chime of the bell. Boom.

Edit... Thank all of you for all the information. My boyfriend thought it 
 was amazing that I'm trying to learn more. I think I'm starting to like the story line. I still cringe when someone jumps on top of someone else. It just looks so painful. I love football and still cringe and feel bad after a bad tackle, so I don't think that is going to change.  Anyway thanks guys. I'm sure I will be back to stay informed of what's going on. I subscribed to subreddit at least.

Mark Henry was attacked by The Shield a few weeks ago and this has caused Henry to give credit to Cena for making him tap out and helping out the Usos. A heel Mark Henry would have demanded for a rematch, but the WWE has different ideas and plans. Teaming with The Usos against The Shield in a six-man tag match at SummerSlam would be a horrendous idea. The Usos and The Shield are all young and upcoming superstars. They can fly around the ring and produce high quality and entertaining matches. Just look what they did on the Money in the Bank Kickoff match. Having Henry involved would slow the match down and then become boring. An even worse idea would be to have Henry face Dean Amborse for The United States Championship. Henry is the strongest man in the world and he needs to be holding a more prestigious belt to finish off his career at WWE. Giving him the belt might do wonders for the big man if he has another couple years left, but from previous injuries that is a long shot. If Mark Henry officially turns babyface (if he hasn't already) then his mic time would probably lessen and we all know that Henry is probably is a top three superstar when it comes to his mic skills (behind Cena and Punk).  WWE needs Henry to wear the WWE Championship for at least a short period of time before he retires. If he is still around next year by Money in the Bank I think it would some what interesting if he would win the Money in the Bank briefcase. When he cashes it in, he would get a similar pop like Dolph Ziggler did the night after Wrestlemania on Raw.

You just had such a strong affirmation that once you see the Stunner, the Pedigree, People's Elbow, Sweet Chin Music, Tombstone or any moves akin to this tier successfully landed, the 3-count would indefinitely proceed them. 

But times have changed, have they not? 

You only need to look back at the abismal main event of Wrestlemania 29 to witness the cataclysmic decline of 'the finisher' in matches today, as both The Rock and John Cena proceeded to land more than 5 finishes each before the pinfall, formulating almost the entire last 15 minutes of the match. Although some may argue this adds good elements of entertainment and unpredictability to the conclusion of big matches, people reading this over the age of 20 will surely recognise the shocking decline in effectiveness of 'the finisher' and now it's seen as more of a formality to prelude an ending, rather than the definitive ending to a match.

1363417943.0,15,self.WWE,1aeeul,20-1: Why CM Punk Should Beat Taker (Warning: Long),MajoraOfTime,25,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1aeeul/201_why_cm_punk_should_beat_taker_warning_long/,"It is official. At Wrestlemania 29, CM Punk is set to face the Undertaker and attempt to do what no man has done before: end the Streak. This is the first time since Wrestlemania 24 that someone not named Shawn Michaels or Triple H has faced Taker and is sure to be one of, if not, the best match at Wrestlemania this year. While it seems a forgone conclusion that the Undertaker will win, I don’t think it is quite so obvious and in fact, this result shouldn’t happen. Right now, WWE has a great opportunity to elevate Punk’s heel persona even more with a win over the Undertaker on the “Grandest Stage of them All.”  

CM Punk has been on a roll as the biggest heel in WWE today and yet seemed to be falling off the map after two losses to the Rock and a loss to John Cena on Raw. That all changed when Punk came out the following week and gained his Mania match with a fatal four way win over three former world champions. The next week, Punk let the mind games begin and instantly gained massive heat in the feud by interrupting Taker’s tribute to Paul Bearer. Despite dropping yet another match (this time at the hands of Kane), Punk still gained a wave of momentum by stealing the urn and actually getting under Taker’s skin (something that hasn’t been seen in a long time). Logic dictates that Punk will continue to get the upper hand until Wrestlemania where he will get his comeuppance at the hands of the Undertaker, but should this be the case? After all Punk has just come off of three big “comeuppances” after his unheard of 434 days as WWE champion came to an end. Why follow up such epic success with such epic failure? Allowing Punk to end the Streak will instantly give him massive heat and solidify his spot as one of WWE’s greatest heels. His momentum will be restored and he will be able to ride this newfound accomplishment into an infinite number of possible storylines.  

In the course of explaining why Punk deserves to end it, one must also understand that this may be WWE’s option as well. In recent months, JR has posted his opinions and predictions in WWE’s PPV events. Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly if you have watched a lot of WWE TV), JR has correctly been able to select the winners of every match in the past few PPV events. Whether this is JR spoiling the results of the PPVs or just guessing how WWE creative would predictably go, one thing is for sure: he knows what he is talking about. When asked about whether or not the Streak should end, JR said this:
So, does Taker being 20-1 at WrestleMania’s adversely affect his legacy? Not in my view. However, does beating the Undertaker at WrestleMania essentially make Punk even more special? Absolutely
Call it a no-brainer that Punk would gain immense intrigue and heat should he end the Streak, but JR’s words are cryptic enough to raise speculation. He looks on the positive side in regards to Taker’s Streak being ended, regarding Punk as having “punched his HOF spot” should he win. In many fans eyes, Punk has already solidified his Hall of Fame spot, but JR is not wrong in his assumption that Punk would be made an even bigger deal than he already is. Factor in JR’s words with the fact that it was reported about a month ago that Taker was “less than 50%” in regards to health and that if he had missed this year, “next year’s event would have been based around his retirement.” If a match against another 40 year old legend in Triple H, which featured Taker on the ground being beaten with a chair for a large portion of its contest, kept Taker at less than 50% for this long, imagine what a physical bout against CM Punk (one that would most likely feature many big wrestling spots) would do to him. As long as we are talking about reports, it is reported that officials are concerned about having Punk follow up three high profile losses with a loss to Taker. Further adding fuel to the fire is Punk’s own statement that he would not care for a match with Taker as the results would be predictable. This raises speculation, as these words were said by the “Straight Edge Superstar” back in September. What changed his mind? Could the seemingly “predictable” outcome have changed? Not to mention the fact that the late, great William Moody (aka Paul Bearer) was quoted in an interview that Undertaker endorsed Punk with an emphatic “He’s one of us.” These reports, all conveniently coming as Punk and Taker’s clash draws nearer, seemingly increase Punk’s chances of ending the Streak and, in my opinion, make him the odds on favorite to win this contest, even if he doesn’t have a 20 year Streak built behind him.  

Of course, there are detractors who believe Punk should not be the man to end the Streak. After all, he is not a homegrown WWE talent, he has stated his intentions of early retirement, he is a heel and heels don’t win big matches clean, he’s small, etc. Not to mention the fact that Punk is WWE’s number two guy (borderline number one, but heels aren’t number one guys) and won’t really have any major backlash from losing to a guy that even Triple H and Shawn Michaels couldn’t beat. Speaking of which, HBK is often brought up as an excuse for why *insert wrestler here* shouldn’t end the Streak. I constantly hear the excuse “If Shawn couldn’t do it, no one should.” Why is this a valid excuse? After all, Shawn Michaels was on his way out both times that he faced Taker. Remember, he disappeared shortly after their first match, came back for a brief stint with DX and was finally felled by the Undertaker. It’s not as if HBK had longevity on his side when he combated the Streak. HBK’s time as “the man who ended the Streak” would’ve gone something like this: he spends his time facing new talent, perhaps getting involved with the Nexus and jobbing to them to get them over until he finally met his end in a match against Triple H at Wrestlemania 27. HBK’s contributions to the business post-Streak would have been minor at best. Or perhaps, he would’ve just straight up retired after ending the Streak and just like that, WWE is without two of its biggest Wrestlemania attractions, rather than slowly weaning us off Taker like they have been doing. CM Punk’s contributions as a major heel post-Streak would be much more effective, considering he has a fresh set of faces in the Shield he could put over, his career will still continue for a few more years at least, and Punk is still at the top of his game and on top of WWE’s current ladder, unlike HBK who was in the “time to put people over” phase of his career by the time he finally challenged the Streak. Punk can not only help put new talent over, but add to his already impressive legacy that ending the Streak would help bolster.  

Another common argument I hear for keeping the Streak intact is because Taker vs. Cena is still a viable dream match at Wrestlemania. Well, I for one believe it is a pipe dream. With WWE’s current angle of “Redemption vs. Greatness,” Cena is going to gain redemption for his horrendous 2012 by vanquishing his demons (starting with CM Punk and ending with The Rock). WWE has competently built up Cena as an underdog over the last year, though not well enough to really sell the feud (why not make  a big deal out of the fact that he finally defeated CM Punk in what was arguably the best match of his career to add to Cena’s explanation for why he can defeat the Rock? I digress). Given that Cena will inevitably defeat the Rock at this year’s Mania, what would be a viable story for his match against Taker next year? Cena can’t really “overcome” anything and using that tired storyline will most likely be met with groans and eye rolls from the “smart” crowd and lackluster cheers from the casual crowd. Having Taker challenge Cena could be a nice touch, but still won’t help define the rest of the story (which will devolve into the former). A Cena heel turn would make sense here, but seems like a “great white buffalo” that will never be. That leaves the outcome of a Cena-Taker match to one of two scenarios: Cena wins and shakes hands with Taker at the end of the night; or Taker wins and disappears, Streak intact. Neither one of those options seem ideal. What would Cena do after ending the Streak? Mention it once the night after while the commentators periodically remind us of the travesty that WWE created? What about if Taker wins? Same scenario. It goes nowhere. Having Punk end the Streak can help Punk ride a wave of momentum and will add to his impressive resume. Conquering Taker at Wrestlemania could open up a nice encounter between Cena and Punk the year after each man accomplishes the biggest obstacles of their careers; Cena defeating the Rock and Punk ending Taker’s Streak. A great main event for the title at Wrestlemania XXX could take place and Cena and Punk could solidify their feud as one of the greatest ever (as most great WWE feuds have been validated by a Wrestlemania main event).  

Of course, there are still those who believe that the Streak should never come to an end. To those people I ask: why not? After all, what is even the point of watching if the assumption of an Undertaker victory is the only logical answer? For those who like boxing, when Floyd “Money” Mayweather fights, do you watch to see him extend his winning streak, or to see if he loses? This is the drama of winning streaks. The longer the streak continues, the more danger it comes under, as momentum is sure to falter eventually. For those that wish to see a winning streak continue, the drama and tension of a challenge to that streak comes from the validity of the challenger. If it seems the streak could end, you appreciate it more and get lost in the moment of witnessing the challenge. You get on the edge of your seat and every potential finishing blow makes you flinch and cringe. After all, when you watch a streak be challenged, the intrigue comes not from watching the streak continue; it comes from seeing if the streak ends. It is why Anderson Silva-Stefan Bonnar got so many PPV buys. Though there was, hindsight, no chance of Bonnar beating Silva, a large portion of UFC viewers must have believed Bonnar was a real threat to Silva’s title reign.  

That, in and of itself, is what makes the Streak such an important part of Wrestlemania and why so many performers have attempted to end it in recent years. Since joining the WWE, Undertaker has never lost at Wrestlemania. Though stars and legends have come and gone, the Undertaker and his impressive Streak have been around during every era of WWE’s modern period. The day is slowly creeping up that the Undertaker will call it quits and retire. Like it or not, one day, the Streak will end, whether Undertaker just stops performing or if someone finally adds that first loss to his Wrestlemania record. Many argue that the Streak is just as part of Undertaker’s legacy as Paul Bearer, the urn, the Ministry of Darkness, and the American Bad Ass angles. To those people I say; of course it is. In fact, it always will be. Just because Taker is no longer crucifying Austin, being led into rings by Paul Bearer and his iconic urn, or riding a motorcycle does not take away those important aspects of his career. No matter if he wins or loses against CM Punk, Undertaker’s Streak will always be a part of his legacy. 20-0 is a record that will never be touched in the history of WWE and even if it becomes 20-1, he’ll always have 20-0. It would not make the 20 years of winning worthless by having the Streak remain intact. In fact, the only thing that would make the Streak “worthless” is the opposite: never ending it. The Streak is a storyline. All storylines have a payoff. The Streak is a storyline that is 20 years in the making (or about 10 since that’s when WWE realized what they had) and needs closure and a grand finale. Having that storyline build and build and build just to fade away into retirement does not equate “payoff.” It would invalidate the importance of the Streak if no one reaped the rewards of its “payoff.” For that to happen, WWE must do what is best for business. WWE must end the Streak and do so in a way that will benefit them most. The best way to do this is by having CM Punk, the WWE’s biggest heel and hyperbolic “Best in the World,” end it and put to rest the career of Mark Calloway aka the Undertaker.  

What do you guys think?

I personally don't get how he is still on TV every night yet a couple years ago RVD got busted and not only did he drop both heavyweight titles he had at the time but he got suspended. I understand RVD was champ and he did deserve it for being an idiot but Swagger should've at least lost his spot on WrestleMania which was probably a big pay day for the dude.

Soon, he was given a chance at the WWE title at Hell in a Cell, against CM Punk.

A rogue referee killed his chance, and isntantly all of his momentum hit the floor. Another loss at survivor series,from the shield TLC left him on the floor. Royal Rumble, picked off by Cena. Lost again from the Shield. Then, what surprised us all. His loss at Wrestlemania. His loss at extreme rules.

This did not bode well with Ryback. Poor booking has left him down again, even though he gets more and more title shots, do we really expect someone who has lost every match since Hell in a Cell to be a viable contender for the WWE Championship?

No, we don't, and he will probably lose again at Payback. But, if we could turn this around, who could of Ryback feuded with from the start, or at least after Payback?

.

.

.


4-Brock Lesnar

Ryback and Brock Lesnar are similar in size and strength, making a feud between the two very intriguing.

Although Lesnar and Goldberg didn’t have a great match or feud with one another, it had nothing to do with their size and strength.

Instead, it had to do with the fact that they knew it was their last match in WWE, giving them less motivation to put on a good show.

Ryback is an up-and-coming WWE Superstar who, although having a morbidly bad losing streak, may be a World Champion this year, or in 2014. Brock Lesnar needs to stop wrestling other part-time wrestlers and begin to challenge current top Superstars in WWE.

Ryback as World champion would be a great fit for Brock Lesnar in 2013. You can almost see it. Ryback wins the MITB. The years second biggest event, Summerslam, is when he cashes in. The current World Champion may be Dolph Ziggler, or even someone else, but it doesn't matter, because Lesnar is competing against them.

Ryback storms down the ramp, cashes it in and beats them to the floor, pinning them. Suddenly, Lesnar comes from behind, picks Ryback off his feet and delivers an F-5, setting them up for a feud and keeping Lesnar in the spot light until Wrestlemania 30, where some speculate he may face The Rock.

.

.

.

3-Sheamus

Another WWE Superstar with similar size and strength as Ryback is the former WWE and World Heavyweight champion, the Celtic Warrior, Sheamus.

Sheamus has been impressive in the past with the moves he has been able to pull off on someone like Big Show, making a feud with Ryback must-see.

Right now, Sheamus is lost without anything to do. He is currently in a feud, or was with The Shield. A feud with Ryback could once again bring him into the spot light.

Sheamus has had difficulty rising to be the next top babyface in WWE due to his corny jokes and becoming the next silly John Cena.

A feud with Ryback could help Sheamus become popular once again with WWE fans, especially if Ryback continues his heel run.

.

.

.

2-Daniel Bryan

Although not being the same size as Ryback, or having the same strength, Daniel Bryan may be WWE's most valuable, or most skilled asset at the moment. Rybacks match with Bryan was one of his best, and shows that Daniel Bryan can carry anyone though a match, and make it good.

Daniel Bryans speed could merge well with Rybacks strength. Even though it may not be a title feud, it could very well still be very entertaining. With Daniel Bryan as a face now, it could garner a lot of heat for Ryback as a heel.

While Ryback is still green, both on the mic and in the ring, feuding with Bryan could help him progress into a good superstar, and a title contender in the future.

.

.

.

1-Wade Barrett

Even though barrett is a good heel, he could also work as a face. Keeping him heel would require Ryback to change back to face.Barrett certainly would match up with Ryback for an extended feud. His character revolves around being master of the underground fighting world. Ryback destroys everything WWE puts in the ring with him. Together, it would make for a very beneficial feud.

For Ryback, it could allow him flexibility to expand his character. But in the end, it represents an opportunity for him to move up the ranks while confronting his former leader of Nexus. (A great callback to Ryback's previous incarnation as Barrett's lackey.)

For Barrett, feuding with one of the WWE's up and coming monsters is an opportunity to demonstrate his position of becoming one of next big stars. There's no doubt he'll be in a title picture soon. But to have the pathway paved to a World title with a victory over Ryback under his belt would further boost his stock.

Yes, ultimately, Barrett should be the one to defeat Ryback.

It wouldn't hurt Ryback's character to do the job. Doing so would only show how well he can lose. After all, wrestling is one big hustle anyway. The best hustlers are the ones who can lose as a true professional.

This could be a very interesting feud, especially if Ryback were to go for the Inter Title instead of the WWE title. The WWE should let him build up, not force him at us. As I said earlier, Barrett could benefit from a push more than Ryback, as he is arguably the most talented of the two.

(This is long),sonnylarson,19,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1api4o/wwe_march_madness_bracket_this_is_long/,"So with March Madness going on I was wondering if the WWE Reddit would be interested in putting together a bracket of 68 WWE Superstars (Past and present) and voting on who the best all time is. The way I'm thinking of it is to be spilt up into 4 Regions, Pre Attitude Era, Attitude Era, Post Attitude Era (aggression era) and The PG Era. Also if a superstar has wrestled consistently in more then one Era they can be seeded in another Era but only one entry per superstar. Example: Let's take Undertaker He has been around forever so he can be placed anywhere in my mind he should be a 1 seed, But Stone Cold Steve Austin would be my Attitude Era 1 seed so what do I do with Undertaker? I make him the Post Attitude 1 seed. Also superstar feeling blind seeding. Example I know you hate John Cena but besides C.M. Punk ho has done more in the PG Era? Not many so Cena although we hate him could?should be a 1 seed in the Era. Also if we as a whole hate the PG Era instead we can have a miscellaneous Region that has Mangers and other personality's from the WWE In general. If not then we can sprinkle them in in their respected Eras. 
So what do you all think about this? Are you interested? Let me know ",,False,self,t5_2rau9,False,,,True,t3_1api4o,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1api4o/wwe_march_madness_bracket_this_is_long/,

**Who is in Brock Lesnar's sights?**

After Brock Lesnar defeated Triple H at SummerSlam, he said in a Tout that he accomplished everything he set out to do and he was never coming back to WWE. Why did Lesnar resurface in WWE last week? Is there something new he is hoping to accomplish in 2013? If he’s willing to attack The Chairman, is anyone safe? Lots of questions remain about what the former UFC Heavyweight Champion might do next.

**How will the Chairman Respond to Lesnar's attack?**

Certainly, Mr. McMahon is not one to simply forget what Brock did to him. It’s a safe bet that there will be repercussions after The Chairman recovers from his injury … or maybe even sooner. But since Lesnar is not currently a contracted WWE Superstar, Mr. McMahon can’t fire him. So how will The Chairman get retribution?

With a roster of Superstars at his command, could Mr. McMahon employ their services? Will action come as soon as Monday, or will the boss bide his time before he unleashes holy hell on Lesnar for what he did? Regardless of how big or bad Lesnar is, Mr. McMahon is certain to find a way to even the score.

**Is Heyman on borrowed time?**

After an incriminating video left Paul Heyman squirming about his ties to The Shield and Brad Maddox, Mr. McMahon appeared poised to fire him last week … until Lesnar came calling. Although Heyman appeared shocked at what Lesnar did to Mr. McMahon, he certainly didn’t do anything to stop things. Heyman, an admitted liar, may have found a way to hide his ties to The Shield and Maddox for months, but how could he possibly talk his way out of his latest predicament with The Boss? Perhaps his upcoming appearance on ""Miz TV"" will shed some light on recent events.

**What will the Shield do next?**

With Lesnar and Heyman on The Chairman’s least favorite list, The Shield can’t be far behind. At Royal Rumble, Mr. McMahon was very explicit about keeping The Shield away from the WWE Championship Match. If they interfered, Punk was to be stripped of his title. When the black-clad group seemingly jumped The Rock, Mr. McMahon was ready to take action … until Rock demanded the match not end that way. 

When The Shield first surfaced in WWE, they claimed to stand for justice. Now that the gig is up, what will they do next? 

**Will CM Punk stick with Heyman?**

Say what you want about CM Punk, his 434-day reign as WWE Champion is something very few Superstar have, or ever will, accomplish. Even WWE Champion The Rock gave The Second City Saint props for such a lengthy reign. But now that the cat is out of the bag so to speak about Heyman’s dealings with The Shield and Brad Maddox, will Punk stick with Heyman? If Punk wants to reclaim the WWE Title from The Rock at Elimination Chamber ), will he start to distance himself from Heyman … or completely cut off all ties? Punk’s next move ought to be interesting.

1353631159.0,15,self.WWE,13n7g6,How WWE could make The Miz a huge star.,BananaSheet,19,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/13n7g6/how_wwe_could_make_the_miz_a_huge_star/,"As most of you probably know, The Miz has slowly, but surely, been turning face the last couple of weeks. In a lot of ways this all culminated when he joined Team Foley for Survivor Series, cementing his faceturn. I've always thought that Miz would make a great face. On the mic he's one of the very best in the company, in the ring he's also very good, especially lately as he has turned up his intensity, and he's got a lot of good looking, original moves.

The Miz really is the perfect underdog story. He started out as a reality TV contestant, eventually making his way to the WWE, where he was mocked and laughed at on a daily basis. But he didn't quit, he didn't let go of his dream. He kept on working his way up, constantly getting better and better, despite all his critics. Today he is a former WWE Champion, Intercontinental Champion, and one of the few Triple Crown winners in the company. If this isn't the perfect ""follow your dreams""-story I don't know what is. Needless to say, Miz has got everything he needs to make it as a top babyface, including mic and ringskills, catchphrases, charisma and backstory. The only thing he's really lacking right now is that big storyline that propels him into the top of the card, and the very top of the WWE as a whole. How do you do that? Well, here's how I would do it.

WWE TLC is coming up and The Big Show, the current World Heavyweight Champion, needs a challenger. The obvious choice of course is Sheamus, the former Champion, who lost to Big Show at Survivor Series in a controversial way. On an episode of Smackdown, Sheamus will come out and ask for a rematch, but before he can get an answer he is interrupted... By Wade Barrett. Barrett tells Sheamus that if anyone deserves a title shot it's him. This brings out another man, Randy Orton. Orton thinks that he's been out of the title picture for way too long, and that it now is his time to shine. Suddenly ""AWESOME!"" is heard throughout the arena and The Miz comes out. Miz says that out of all the guys in the ring, he's the hungriest and most deserving of a title shot. This brings out GM Booker T to make a match for the night's main event; A Fatal Fourway Number 1. Contenders match.

Miz wins this Fatal Fourway. He pins Wade Barrett after the Big Show had interfered and viciously attacked everyone but him. The following weeks Big Show will explain that the only reason he let Miz go was because he knew that out of those four men, he was easily the weak link. Big Show also says that at TLC he will have no problem beating The Miz, or anybody else for that matter, and that he simply picked the opponnent that required the less effort.

TLC comes around and Big Show defends his title against The Miz in a TLC match. The previous weeks more and more pressure has been building on The Miz. Will he be able to do the impossible, will he exceed the expectations and win his first World Heavyweight Championship? Everyone is wondering if Miz somehow can pull this off and become champion. Aaaand... He gets beaten to a pulp. The Big Show dominates the entire match, beating the living daylight out of him with tables, ladders and chairs, before easily climbing up the ladder and retaining his title. Miz will be so badly beaten that he will be out with injuries for the rest of the year.

Then, in January, The Royal Rumble comes along. The Road To Wrestlemania has begun! Sheamus, who was denied his rematch last month, is again back in the title picture and will try to win back the World Heavyweight Championship in a Last Man Standing match. After putting on an amazing fight though, he ends up not victorious. The Big Show is still champion.

Then the Royal Rumble match is up. This match will feature a lot of big names, more specifically people like The Rock and John Cena, who are the clear favorites to get the win. The match begins wrapping up, with only a couple of entrants left. Then, at the 29 mark, something unbelievable happens. A sudden voice yelling ""AWESOME!"" is heard throughout the arena and out comes Miz, looking to be back at 100%. Miz will then go on to eliminate the rest of the competitiors in the ring, before finally turning to the ramp for the final entrant. That entrant is Sheamus.

Sheamus, last years winner, and Miz will have a brutal back and forth bout, before Sheamus eventually gets Miz on the apron(similar to him and Jericho from last year). Sheamus will go for the Brogue Kick and Miz will duck in the last second, causing Sheamus to trip over the top rope and down to the floor. That is it, and The Miz has won the Royal Rumble. He will get a free Championship Match of his choosing at Wrestlemania, and Miz, without a doubt, chooses The World heavyweight Championship.

The weeks go by as The Big Show keeps embarassing The Miz. He shows footage from their match at TLC, he shows clips from Miz's reality TV past and his debut in the WWE, even going as far as telling Miz that he never should have even been in a wrestling ring, let alone in the biggest wrestling company in the world. Eventually Big Show will go on to Elimination Chamber, where he will defend his title against Randy Orton, Sheamus, Wade Barrett, Kofi Kingston and Dolph Ziggler. Big Show will win this match, truly proving his dominance and showing that he will never lose that championship. Then, when Big Show is about to go backstage, The Miz will come out on the ramp, with a microphone in his hands.

Miz, who has been unusually quiet since his return, cuts a long and detailed promo about how the only thing he ever wanted to do was be a professional wrestler. It's been his biggest dream since he was a little kid, and he has worked his ass off for years and years to get to where he is today. ""At Wrestlemania 29 it is you and me, big man!"" Miz will say, before announcing that nothing will stand in his way. He will become World Heavyweight Champion. He will fulfill his boyhood dream and there is nothing Big Show can do to stop it.

The following weeks leading up to Wrestlemania the rivalry between Miz and Show will continue to heat up, becoming increasingly hatefilled and dangerous by the day. When Wrestlemania finally comes around, these men will hate each other so badly that all they want to do at Wrestlemania is end the others career.

At Wrestlemania The Big Show and The Miz will have an amazing back-and-forth bout, lasting over 20 minutes and showing the absolute best out of both men. The finish will come after The Big Show sets Miz up for a huge top rope Chokeslam, which Miz counters. Miz will then grab Show's arms and put him in a Full Nelson, before performing a top rope Scull Crushing Finale on him and pinning him. The pin will be a successful one and Miz will be the new World Heavyweight Champion, after winning the biggest match of his life.

The Miz, with tears of joy running down his face, will celebrate with the fans and truly make the most out of this amazing moment. As he walks up the ramp he turns around to face the crowd, lifts the championship up in the air and gets an eroptous roar from the crowd. Right at this moment Dolph Ziggler suddenly appears from behind, hits Miz in the back of the head with the Money in The Bank briefcase, drags him to the ring and cashes in his contract.

Miz will eventually get to his feet and Dolph will hit him with the Zig Zag. 1, 2... Miz kicks out! Dolph looks absolutely shocked, before he puts Miz in the Sleeper Hold. After almost a minute in the hold, Miz will get to the ropes, forcing the break. Dolph will look absolutely infuriated, but as Miz struggles to get to his feet Dolph jumps up and delivers a second Zig Zag, finally earning him the pinfall.

This will spark the start of a new feud between The Miz and Dolph Ziggler, which could very well last for 3-6 months, perhaps culminating at Summerslam where Miz wins the title. This storyline will truly show Miz as a man who refuses to give up on his dreams, and keeps on coming back, even after suffering several serious injuries. It will lead to monster heat for both Big Show and Dolph Ziggler and the WWE will have created a new megastar in The Miz.

Match was pretty good, back and forth between both individuals. However the funny thing is: Why the hell is the IC Championship defended in a preshow? All the promos throughout WM lasted about 30min. - 1hr, with so much dead air can't they cut out the crap and put the IC in the actual card? Didn't The Miz main event Wrestlemania and got put over by super Cena 2 years ago? Shame how far he dropped. *Shakes head*

***Orton/Big Show/Sheamus vs The Shield***  

This was pretty predictable, after all why would a pieced together team consisting of a face,antihero and a heel be able to beat apparently ""one of the best teams in the history of WWE""? Also: Why no Orton heel turn? Why did the ""already"" heel Big Show go heel for like the 100th time? What was the point of the match? The Shield was already over with the crowd since their debut.

***Mark Henry vs Ryback***

What was the point of having Henry beat Ryback? At this point his ""feed me more"" catchphrase is pretty much dead. Apparently Henry was too big of a meal for him.

***Ziggler/Big E vs Hell No***

Why the hell is Ziggler jobbing again? Mr. Money in the bank shouldn't really be losing clean matches after matches, especially if they're heels. It would've gone better if Bryan or Kane fucked it up and got the loss ending up in a Kane vs Bryan at extreme rules while pushing Ziggler as 1/2 of the Tag champions that goes on to win the WHC at Extreme rules. If Vince really wants us to believe in Ziggler when he eventually wins the WHC then he better start pushing him past the midcard.

***Fandango vs Jericho***

It was pretty obvious that Jericho carried Fandango through this, you could see that he was calling the shots every time he held Curtis' head towards his mouth. I wouldn't say that it was a back and forth match between them but it was pretty good for how it ended. Fandango got a cheap win while making Jericho look strong. I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being a rematch at Extreme Rules.

***ADR vs Swagger***

I predicted Swagger getting the win but was shocked at ADR retaining. Not sure how this will go on since WWE hyped up Swagger's ""America"" so hard the past few weeks with promos. I was also certain that Swagger would attack ADR after his loss ending up with Ziggler strolling down the ramp and cashing in, unfortunately that didn't happen which is probably why the crowd started booing.

***The Undertaker vs CM Punk***

This was by far the best match of the card. Taker pulls it off again and CM Punks shows that he is indeed ""the best in the world"". Despite having huge shoes to fill, Punk shows that he can run with HHH and Michaels in his performance with Taker.

***HHH vs Lesnar***

Despite coming out covered in semen, Trips held his own against Lesnar in a very exciting match, ending with a pedigree on steel. Shawn also took a hard bump when Lesnar elbowed him in the face, you could see him bleeding out the nose after the match: how painful. It was awesome seeing both of them locking Kimura's on each other and you could see it on Lesnar's face how bad it was; great acting! The crowd however, seems to be sapped of energy due to the match before with Taker and Punk. It was also interesting to see how willing HHH was to put his body on the line, despite being rich as fuck. 

***Cena vs The Rock***

""Once in a Lifetime: The rematch"" it should be named. It can't get anymore predictable than this. Rock has to film a movie -&gt; drops title to super cena. ""The champ is here"", Cena says; it can't get anymore cliche' than that. During the last 10 minutes or so, it was just watching them trade finishers, can the Rock Bottom even be considered a finisher anymore? 

**-This WM was pretty stale, nothing too unpredictable happened. But Wrestlemania is Wrestlemania, nothing can top the fireworks and the energy. The environment was good but the execution was so-so. It was also sad to see Rhodes Scholars and Tons o' Funk not being able to wrestle. Seeing their twitter pics prepping for their grand entrance to the biggest stage of them all only to have it cancelled last minute due to the stupidity of the creative mistiming the show is one of the worst feelings for every wrestler.** ",,False,self,t5_2rau9,1365443164.0,,,True,t3_1bxby3,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/1bxby3/my_take_on_wrestlemania_xxix/,

Looking at The Shield and more broadly The WWE Championship storyline (Involving Cena, Rock, Punk, Ryback, The Shield, Bork and the seemingly more involved Sheamus), what matches/stories do you see unfolding for WM?

What we know since Royal Rumble:

* CM Punk vs The Rock at Elimination Chamber for the title.
* The Rock (or possibly but not likely Punk) vs Cena at WM for the title.

(Non Title Storyline)

* On Raw, The Shield fought Cena, Ryback &amp; Sheamus.
* On Smackdown, The Shield fought *just* Sheamus.
* Heyman is seemingly behind The Shield and/or who they attack.
* Bork came back for a little WM action.

So what role do you think The Shield, Sheamus, Ryback, CM Punk, Heyman, Bork or even Taker have for WM?

Will we see Taker vs Punk or Taker vs Bork? [Maybe  Bork is involved with Rock &amp; Cena?](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/6773443/wrestlemania_29_poster.0_standard_352.0.jpg).

WWE is well known for foreshadowing the future so my prediction is that John Cena will have another first. A more controversial first. I believe John Cena will be the first superstar to cash in money in the bank and not become WWE champion. The dirt sheets have been hyping the new WWE championship title that is supposed to debut on the 1000th raw. The spinner belt represents John Cena more than anything else. Some how cena could be screwed out of his match we have seen that before. And CM Punk will usher in a solidified spot at the top possibly losing to big show in a feud where the underdog punk is on a quest to regain his WWE title. The screw job would then set up the next Cena fued with who ever causes him to lose his contracted bout. Maybe even by the hand of his last wrestlemania opponent the Rock.
