The jokes aren't too forced, the characters aren't contrived idiots.  The dumbest guy on the show, Dale, is probably one of the nicest fathers you can see on TV. The fact the show isn't regarded as a classic is kind of crazy to me. The show dives into most issues other cartoon shows can't even imagine. From Bill wanting to kill himself, to not being able to have kids, gay dads, etc


It's a shame the show was never thought of to be great. I guess it is for a niche audience though. I grew up in a small Texas town, and I relate  a lot to the show. 

I feel like I just discovered this show, and I have nobody to talk about it with since my friends never really liked the show either.

Reddit, please go and watch this show and help us get renewed for another season. [x-post from /r/community]",sponto_pronto,606,183,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/qybha/tonight_after_a_four_month_hiatus_community_airs/,"Hello Reddit! Greetings from /r/community!

Tonight at 8/7c, a new episode of the TV show Community airs on NBC.

**What is Community?**

Community is a sitcom revolving around a group of misfits during their way through Community College, but it is unlike any sitcom you've ever seen. It's fresh, innovative, and goes where no TV show has gone before - but why tell you, if we can show you:

[Fan-made trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2ml1vuZOXc)

**Why do we ask you to watch it?**

Community is critically acclaimed and has a passionate fanbase, but has poor ratings. This is mainly due to the fact that many people don't know about this show, since NBC has done a poor job promoting it, and the Thursday 8PM timeslot collides with one of the most successful TV shows currently on the air, ""The Big Bang Theory.""
Because of the ratings, at this point it is unclear if the show will be renewed. If the show gets great ratings tonight, it might be the signal NBC needs to give the show a fourth season. This is why we're asking for your help!

**How can you help us?**

First of all:

* Watch the show!
* Tell your friends!

Also, there are some things you can do to actively help the show:

* If you have a friend who has a Nielson box, pay him/her a surprise visit, and watch the show with him/her. The Nielson rating is an important factor for the future of Community.
* Record the show on your TiVo/DVR, and watch it tonight! These views are counted, too.
* Tweet about the show on Twitter, using the hashtag #CoolCoolCool
* Visit the Community homepage on nbc.com, watch some clips, show NBC that people are interested in this show.


Thanks for your time!

The main thing I want to bring to your attention is the ""anthology"" nature of the show. 

Season 1 was the story of a family moving into a haunted house. The story had a beginning, and a middle, and and end planned out. Crazy, right? 

Rather than try to keep that story going past it's natural end, they are moving on to a different script entirely, set in an asylum. Some of the same actors will return, but with different roles. 

I think this is an excellent development in television. Currently, you get a great show and a great cast/crew together but the story just gets more and more convoluted and drawn out to keep it all going. This way, there's a level of trust built up but we get to see them do something else and with a planned ending. Sort of like a ""universe"" or ""setting"" franchise. Imagine if all the Star Treks were distilled down to their best three seasons with a defined story arc. Or if LOST ended after that first season and they were able to start over the next year with a different group of castaways, perhaps around Desmond's story, each season peeling back another layer of the island's onion.

But five seconds after the twist theyre playing a promo telling me how it plays out! 

Same for other shows where a character may or may not be dead or some other question the episode has posed, the promo usually gives it right away and it starts RIGHT when the episode ends. 

Same for tons of other shows - I want to relax after a show, let twists and plot moments sink in and let me ponder how the story will keep going. I dont want to scramble to pause or turn the tv off. Books don't give previews of the next chapter before you read it!

But now, I think it should be ended, for a multitude of reasons

1: Micheal Scott's antics made the show hilarious and his personality worked well with the other characters. I'm not saying that Steve Carrell was the only reason to watch the show, but the setup now just doesn't work. His character created over-the-top situations and his social awkwardness made you cringe, and the other characters could work from that. They have nothing to work with now except their own boring lives

2: Robert California is an awful character. What is his personality supposed to be? He's the CEO of the company but spends all his time in the Scranton Branch, which was given a reason for but still seems really forced. He's supposed to be mysterious but he's just one of those guys that tries to give you really deep and thoughtful insight.

3: Andy is the regional manager. Andy is also a mediocre character. Why was he even picked as regional manager? Because he has potential or some shit like that. Now most of the show revolves around him, and he's not really that much of an interesting character.

4: The show used to be a comedy, now it's just sort of a really undramatic drama about the lives of the workers at Dunder Mifflin.

Does anyone agree? Disagree?

Just to add in, I think Jim Carrey would have been a good fit for regional manager. Although he had a pretty small part, he seemed like the good amount of awkward.

The website is finally shaping up to be what I want it to be and I need a bit of user data (mainly ratings) to keep working on some features (among other things, I wanna create network score average through those pages http://broadcasted.tv/network/8/hbo/).

It is a very early beta so don't worry about broken links or things that don't look perfect, it'll be fixed in the coming weeks.

As as of now, here's some of the features (some of them might not be entirely functional):
- You can follow you favourite tv shows, your followed shows will appear in your customized news feed (which uses headlines from a few different tv news sources) as well as your customized schedule (which combines tv shows from all other the world)
 - Watchlist (for the shows you want to watch in the future)
- Custom Lists (not functional)
- Badges, I will add some as we go but you should get badges for writing a certain number of reviews, scoring a certain number of shows and so on
- Top 10, you can create your tv shows 10 (I had fun doing that)
- Show average comes with a chart (most of them will look empty) but I'm planning to have those for episodes and seasons which will help me show the evolution of the quality of a tv show

Thanks a lot to Redditors who contributed ideas in the original thread, some of them will appear on the website very soon.

Please report any bug to me and let me know what you think of the website (keep in mind that it is just a first draft and that the website will change a lot in the coming few weeks).

Note: There isn't as many tv shows as there should be so if it is important that I add one, please let me know.

There is no page with all of the tv shows but there is quick search function that allows you to search through the URL address bar in your browser (if you type 'http://broadcasted.tv/arrested', it will take you straight to Arrested Development's page)

Here it is http://broadcasted.tv/

Edit: I'm gonna have to take a quick break from bug fixing or my eyes are gonna catch on fire. I'll still be around. Thank you so much for your support.

Edit2: I'm back, I'm aware the website is missing a lot of tv shows. Please let me know if you see one I need to add NOW. Keep the tips coming!

Edit3: Again, thank you for your support, I'll spend a day adding shows on Monday so expect to find everything you need by then.

David Gordon Green found the perfect balance between his early arthouse work and his silly, stoner comedy film work he's been churning out recently.  I'm also really looking forward to what Jody Hill does with his career.  The way he uses music, montages, and can turn from a silly gross out scene to a heartfelt, humanizing moment is really amazing.  

EB&amp;D was a truly unique show, and it's sad to see it go, but at least it was at the discretion of the creators rather than getting shut down by HBO.

so I love tv shows and I take them pretty seriously, I watch only the good ones and I become completely immersed in them. I generally stray away from comedy-type shows

my all time favourites in no order include: the sopranos, lost, the killing, mad men, breaking bad, the shield, sons of anarchy, deadwood, 24, dexter, the office, the wire

i hear nothing but good things about six feet under, especially the finale. my question is, do you think I should watch all 63 episodes or can i skip ahead? I've only seen the pilot, i'm not hooked, but of course it's only 1 
episode.

what kind of things can I expect from the show, are there jaw-dropping moments? Thank you for any responses.

""Ice"" - **The X-Files** (season 1, episode 8). The episode that got me, and others I imagine, hooked on this show.

""Chardee MacDennis"" - **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia** (season 7, episode 7). Easily one of the show's best episodes (not a small feat considering it's 8 seasons in), and probably one of the best half hours of comedy on TV in the recent past.

CBS Exec B: Oh yeah, it's great. Everyone's talking about it. We should do a show about Sherlock Holmes too. 

CBS Exec A: Definitely, but they can't be too similar.

CBS Exec B: So what should we change?

CBS Exec A: Well in Sherlock the main character is brilliantly acted in a way that fits the traditional reading while still being modern and engaging.

CBS Exec B: Probably one of the reasons for the shows success. 

CBS Exec A: True, so lets make our Sherlock impulsive, abrasive, and pointlessly weird. Like a mix between Monk and Shawn Spencer, but without any of the humor or charm. 

CBS Exec B: Got it. What about Watson. I love how Watson's character has his own issues and plot lines that don't just support Sherlocks character but intertwine to give the story depth and draw you into the moment. 

CBS Exec A: That sounds difficult. Lets make Watson female, Asian, and hot. What's Lucy Liu doing these days? Tell her we want the same character she's played on every other show she's ever done.

CBS Exec B: Great. What about the cinematography? Those little asides they do to reveal the clues are prefect for showing us what Sherlock's thinking without having to state it right away.

CBS Exec A: Unfortunately, we'll probably get sued if we do anything like that. Lets just have Sherlock talk about the clues in the most wooden dialogue possible. Maybe he can hold up a sign that says ""Will deliver exposition for food."" so the Muricans know to pay attention to what he's saying.

CBS Exec B: Noted. Which UK studio should we have shoot this?

CBS Exec A: Oh no we're going to set the show in New York. That way we can copy and paste the rest of the supporting characters, locations, and plot lines from every other crime drama on this network. 

CBS Exec B: But why would Sherlock move to New York?

CBS Exec A: I don't know. Say it's because of a drug problem or something. Sherlock used a lot of cocaine in the original books right?

CBS Exec B: I couldn't tell you. I never learned how to read. But they had something about drugs on the BBC version so that must be true. Now we just need a title.

I am just a guy who likes the show.

Anyway, I encourage anyone who has a spare 30 minutes to check this show out. [The show](http://braingames.nationalgeographic.com/) is basically about your brain and how it works. It talks about optical illusions, how we process 3D images, differences in detecting spatial relationships across genders, and a variety of interesting topics.

The show is presented in a somewhat corny fashion, almost as if it was designed to be shown in high school classrooms, but that doesn't matter to me. They are able to first demonstrate some interesting brain...phenomenon and then explain it to the viewer in a sort of ELI5 manner, but with more science so you don't feel like you are being talked down to.

The other reason I like this show is because it is actually a show where (so far) every time I have watched it I've learned something. Also, it's not a reality show. It's finally a show on a ""science"" channel that deals with science.

I think a lot of you might like it.

I'm a fan of a lot of the comedies airing on television. I'm a television fanatic. To me, the top tier of television comedy lies within Arrested Development, the early seasons of Community, Parks &amp; Recreation, and occasionally, Archer.

There's a second tier of comedy shows that I enjoy. Shows like How I Met Your Mother, 30 Rock, Modern Family, and earlier seasons of The Office, where the laughs come, the characters are funny, and you feel like you just watched a good episode of television.

Happy Endings belongs in the first tier. The top tier. Season 1 was good, and got better as the writers found the strengths in the characters. Season 2 was amazing. Season 3 proves to me that this is a show worth saving and worth watching. The characters are hilarious and the writing is quick, sharp, and witty. The actors go all out for the jokes, and it shows, and it works. 

Please, watch the show. It's airing two episodes a night on Fridays on ABC, starting March 29th. It's almost sentenced to cancellation, but maybe some online buzz could help it. Check out /r/HappyEndings, that subreddit could definitely use some promotion and subscriptions. 

**TL:DR**; Watch this underrated show. Give it a few episodes. The first season is slightly weaker but still hilarious. The second season and third are brilliant.

Every once in a while you get wrapped up in a show, though, that not only engages you emotionally or even intellectually but actually helps you to think through some things in your life and become a better person.

I've been thinking about this lately while watching (very late to the party) *Mad Men*. I'm almost through the second season (no spoilers, please!) and I am realizing how much more deeply it has caused me to think about women's issues (then and now) than I did before. I have always tried to be sensitive to gender issues but *Mad Men* has helped make some serious and subtle issues in workplace discrimination and gender relationships very clear to me, and I think it will have a long-term effect on my outlook and how I work to support others.

What TV shows have you watched and loved that actually changed your views on something, and helped make you a better person?

Here is the source on this decision. [[1]](http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/11250/no-further-gargoyles-dvd-releases-currently-planned) [[2]](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Gargoyles/5139) [[3]](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Gargoyles/6182)

Lets prove them wrong.

If you have not yet bought Gargoyles DVDs, buy them. Here are convenient amazon links without affiliate codes (I know I could have put them there, but I care more about gargoyles than a few dollars).

[Season 1](http://www.amazon.com/Gargoyles-Complete-Season-Keith-David/dp/B0002W4SY0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320721788&amp;sr=8-1)

~~[Contact the Disney Store](http://aimg.disneystore.com/content/global/guest_services10/contact.html) and ask for Gargoyles Season 2 Volume 2, and why you can't buy it using the above link.~~

As Dave Lambert pointed out below, a better way:

&gt;Call Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment's customer care agents directly at 1-800-72-DISNEY and ask them where you can buy the title. When they tell you it's not available, ask them ""why not"" or ""when will it be released"" or whatever.

I don't watch much television as it airs, but I do love to have series to follow. Firefly, Pushing Daisies, US of Tara, and Dead Like me are a few of my favorites and all share one thing in common... they were all cancelled. I think the only show that I've loved that wasn't cancelled was Six Feet Under, and it was such a great series.

Doofus Friend: He connected the dots. It's totally gonna be a circle.

King recently did an AMA to promote the show...I'd love to have him back on to ask him what he thinks about spewing utter nonsense that would be trivial to get right. 

I understand waving your hands for sci fi/fantasy elements (e.g. warp engines, etc.), but there's really no excuse for not taking five goddamn minutes and getting the high school math right.

(I know lots of people know these but I'm sure some people have missed them). For pretty much all of these shows I went in with low expectations and ended up really enjoying them, so I figured I'd see what reddit thinks.


**[Adventure Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time)** - Basically weird and crazy adventures in a fantasy world. The stories are the kind of thing you would imagine that a ten year old kid would think up.

**[Avatar: The Last Airbender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)** - At first seems like a generic kids fantasy show, but pretty quickly you realize it's a clever fantasy epic. The world is really cool, the characters are awesome, and the story is pretty compelling. This is the TV show, not the movie, which I didn't see but heard was awful.

**[Bob's Burgers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers)** - Basically it's like an animated sitcom in a burger shop with wacky characters. The voice actors are really funny - this has a lot of the same people from Home Movies.

**[Clone High](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_High)** - It's a high school run by a mad scientist populated by teenage clones of famous historical figures. Only ran for one season, but it was pretty hilarious.

**[Home Movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_movies_tv_series)** - A bunch of elementary school kids make weird movies and hang out with their crazy gym teacher. A lot of the scenes are mostly improv, which makes for some hilarious and weird dialogue.

**[Regular Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Show)** - Two slackers - a blue jay and a raccoon - work at a park. Lots of weird characters and crazy situations, it's pretty entertaining.

**[The Venture Bros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venture_Bros.)** - Take the premise from Johnny Quest and elements from lots of other pop culture and add a mix of realism and absurd situations.


If anyone knows of more shows in this vein, please post, I'd love more to watch. They're a great contrast for all the ultra serious dramas (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc).

A ""different plot each episode"" refers to the shows where a new ""problem"" arises at the start of each episode and typically gets resolved by the end of the episode. They can sometimes carry over to a second or third episode, and tie into a larger storyline. Examples of these include most shows on TV. The Unit, Terra Nova, House, Law and Order, Alphas, Fringe, X-Files, etc.

Is there a name for this difference? I really enjoy the ongoing plot shows, and it'd be great to be able to google the term and find a list of all of them!

the best example of this is really the 30 rock live show episode where at the end they switch from ""spanish soap-opera"" lighting to the show's normal look/lighting.

I was given special permission from the mods to post this, but he didn't guarantee success/flack about it. 

I am in the middle of a serious effort to save a brilliant show from the threat of cancellation looming. Not yet confirmed in any reports, but fans of *Happy Endings* aren't seeing a 4th season as a possibility. It's been struggling since the Tues. night block in the 3rd season primer in fall 2012, and is now looking closer to death.

I've spent most of the weekend promoting my petition on Change.org to try and stop executives from burying their balls in their asses. 

The writing of the petition took me many hours, and I've been all over promoting it. 500,000 Facebook fans of the show. 100,000 twitter followers of various cast and crew members. 1 million cast member video views on FunnyorDie.com content. Hotties Eliza Coupe, Elisha Cuthbert and Casey Wilson. LadyBoners Damon Wayans, Jr., Adam Pally, and Zachary Knighton. *What is not to love?*

http://www.change.org/petitions/save-happy-endings

I have 3 signatures, as of now, with 1 my own. This is saddening, especially considering the *possibility* of one of the *Happy Endings* stars to conduct a Reddit AMA in the coming days/weeks. I've contacted people who know people, and he's contacted their people. It's confusing, I know. 

This is a self post, so no karma is gained.

Thanks for listening,

Bryan, petition author and #savehappyendings project lead

Has anyone else been enjoying it as much as I have?,Bushy-Top,113,29,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1cmct4/i_have_to_recommend_the_americans_on_fx_has/,"[The show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/) revolves around the Cold War and takes place in 1981 with flashbacks to the 60s.  It stars Keri [Russell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005392/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) and [Matthew Rhys](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722629/?ref_=tt_cl_t2).  They play a Russian couple that were planted in the American suburbs 20 years before the show began.  They've built a normal life and have two kids. The time has come for them to perform missions in the US undetected.  Despite their time together, their marriage was arranged by the Russian government so their love isn't exactly flourishing.

The show also stars [Noah Emmerich](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001187/?ref_=tt_cl_t5) who plays a very calculated FBI agent.  After successfully completing an undercover job with a white supremacist group, he's forced to move to the suburbs to begin his new assignment; chasing the Russian threat.

The show has some great acting, a lot of action, espionage and a little bit of tough love.  You should give it a try. [Here's the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4D96fPl_hI)

Any fan of Homeland should enjoy this a lot but I would have to say this is by far the better of the two.
