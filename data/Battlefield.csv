Oh nice they're in an elevator...

HO SHIT This comander just blasted those tanks with a cruise missle!

THE BUILDING... THE WHOLE DAMN SKYSCRAPER IS GOING DOWN.


Ok yeah NOW I'm excited for BF4.

EDIT:

Just watched it for a second time and few things I noticed.

* **enemy was marked as CN which leads me to be leave in MP you can play as Chinese**

* Attack chopper they took down looked to be a Chinese [Z-10](http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/z10.htm) confirming my above point.

* N S E W arrows ON THE MINI MAP... not some obscure bar that most people don't look at.

* After the building collapse, ~~C flag disappears. Perhaps its advantageous to take down a flag while you hold it? The flag was capped by the enemy and the enemy focused on bringing it down. My guess is that which ever team holds the flag when the building goes down keeps the flag.~~ C flag does return in the building's rubble.

* The support pillar that they took down to bring down the road, specifically had additional red temp-support pillars around it. This may be a ""red-barrel"" marker for any collapse-able columns.

* **In the video it was indeed a RECON that C4'd the tank**

* Commanders can see which squad has what classes. (I didn't play BF2 so I don't know if they could do that before or not)

* Dual-sights is not limited to Irons and one zoomed, video shows guns with two different magnification scopes.

* Pressing the melee button while BEING knifed will create a counter-knife attack.

loner_ru pointed out a few things.

* Squad perks seem to be unlocked via some form of squad XP

* Commanders get certain capabilities depending on what flags are controlled (Evident at 4:20 of the youtube video on the top left)

* Possible [Harbin Z-9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Z-9) during the knife scene, this may be the Chinese version of the US Venom.",Battlefield 4,False,self,t5_2rdgw,1370904161.0,bf4,pure,True,t3_1g2k9h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1g2k9h/bf4did_they_they_just_take_out_a_road/,

Day 1 of BF4 streaming floor gameplay just finished and we were plugged, multiple times. A big thank you to the presenters who must be silent lurkers here. If you send us a message we can get you guys kitted up with some flair and perhaps do some AMAs?

For those unaware of the stream you can view it with premium via:

http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4/e3-live-stream

Or, if you're not part of the Premium master race you can view it without via:

http://www.twitch.tv/battlefield?utm_campaign=live_embed_click&amp;utm_source=www.battlefield.com

Feel free to post observations and the like here. I'll be collating a large thread full of observations and general information known/noticed at the end of the 3 days of gameplay we're getting. I may end up putting another one of these threads up tomorrow and the following day to keep things all in one place each day.

Thank you to everyone for making this subreddit what it is. As you know we hope to keep discussion informative and interesting on the subreddit. We've been pleasantly surprised at how discussion has barely devolved into any problems. Keep it up!

***

Observations and general points from conversation in interviews:

**Suppression** - Now focused on LMGs, suppression no longer has an effect at close range also.

**Tank Smoke** now shoots into the air and starbursts similar to:

http://i.imgur.com/mmDmlLJ.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/Qse5n.jpg

**Ammo** - Everyone is always out of ammo, people are reloading often and ammunition in the clip is discarded.

**Health packs** - There appears to be two health packs, a big and small one.

**Auto leaning** - Far Cry 3 style

**Sliding** ? Not certain

**Water** You can now dive underwater - sidearms usable in water - Water appears volumetric - Sprint swim

**Defibs need recharge**

**Spectator mode** - Appears comprehensive, able to view whole map view, all players on both sides marked, select players from map view with picture in picture. Third and first person. Scoreboard selectable also.

**Vehicle damage** - Vehicle tires now blow - Disabling appears reworked, Venom goes down to 4 health with no repairs but starts regenerating.

**Assists** - High assists now count as kills

**Recon balls** - Bad Company 2 recon balls are back.

**Flashbangs**

***

**Confirmed Gametypes**

[What positional VOIP/audio is](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Positional-Audio)


TLDC (too lazy didn't click): You know how when someone fires their gun, you can tell what direction the shots are coming from just by the sound?  Positional VOIP means that your squadmates voices also sound like they're coming from a certain direction in-game.


Why?

+Helps you instinctively keep track of the position of friendlies from sound alone

+More immersive

+EASY/FAST to implement from a development standpoint

1367386614.0,76,self.Battlefield,1dgsp2,Battlefield Balance Explained.,IPWNUNinjaQuick,98,22,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1dgsp2/battlefield_balance_explained/,"Many players complain that Battlefield 3 classes are not balanced, or that the classes were better balanced in other games. There are some that feel classes need to be more balanced for Battlefield 4, and others that don't like classes at all.

For all of those who are new to the franchise (BC2 or newer), this is an explanation.

Historically, DICE has always focused on Class Roles and internal Class Balance above Cross-Class balance.

What does this mean to the new converts, or relatively clueless veterans?

Simple:

DICE has always had one or two classes that excelled at Infantry Warfare / Spearhead operations. These classes were at the top of the infantry-combat food-chain. No other class got near their lethality against other soldiers with guns, and it was OK. Most players would play these classes because most combat was Infantry combat.

Then DICE would have a class that had very high infantry lethality, but that lacked from either accuracy, mobility or both. These classes typically supported the spearhead by providing fully automatic, high power cover fire, as well as supplies, to the front line. Additionally, some of these classes traded range for explosive power, so that they could handle vehicles that would otherwise decimate the Spearhead.

Behind these classes were the purely support classes, which provided either very slow fire, or a complete lack of ranged combat ability. These classes had other purposes, such as vehicle maintenance and target designation.

In Battlefield 2, these were embodied by:

Spearhead:
Spec-ops.
Assault.
Medic.

Defensive/Cover:
Support
Anti Tank

Support:
Sniper.
Engineer.

But this is not limited to Battlefield 2, as 1942, Vietnam and 2142 all included similar Class distributions.

There were very few scenarios where a Support class or Anti-Tank class could survive an attack on an enemy position that had defenders. That role was exclusive to Assault, or Spearhead, classes. However, at longer ranges, or from a defensive position against many targets, the Spearhead classes began to quickly lose their effectiveness. They were, for the most part, useless against vehicles, and ran out of ammunition too quickly to survive against a large wave of enemies. 

Players were forced to choose a class based on the role they wished to play, rather than what was happening on the battlefield. Choosing to spawn anti-tank was a decision where the player knew they were sacrificing their ranged effectiveness for incredible anti-vehicle capability. It was not a class that intended to take many lives, rather it was meant to save lives. Engineers were similar. You did not spawn engineer unless you had a vehicle to use, or had other tactical reasons to spawn it. The combat range limitations, as well as the tools provided were simply not intended to survive in a massive firefight.

Battlefield 3 owes much of its monotony not to the Assault class, or the Engineer class, rather, their interchangeability. Every firefight essentially plays out the same way since at any given time over 75% of players are combat effective at medium ranges. That, and the maps are too small for the increased mobility. Simply put, unlike all previous Battlefield titles, where spawning a specific kit was a decision, not an impulse or habit. The games made you think, you had to be creative, sneaking passed enemies you were best served to not engage.

Balancing classes to the point where they are all essentially the same just yields a game that everyone has already player. It replaces real variety with apparent variety, by throwing away the relevance of play-style and awareness, and replacing it with slightly different guns and textures and gadgets, but really the same experience all around. 1200 hours of Battlefield 2 was easy *for a casual*. 400 hours of BF3 feels like work.

In short:

If you want inter-class balance, go play Call of Duty.

If you want a deep multiplayer experience with lots of variety, play any Battlefield that came out before Bad Company (PC).

Edit: I stand corrected. Bad Company 1 had a good class system.",,False,self,t5_2rdgw,1367455493.0,other,,True,t3_1dgsp2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1dgsp2/battlefield_balance_explained/,

 - The filters: It's now possible to filter the subreddit depending on what content you want to watch! The filters can be found in the dropdown menu in the header. We currently have a bot assisting in sorting the posts to their appropriate flair. To lighten the workload on the mods, we ask that you use our custom submission buttons in the sidebar 

 - The dropdown menu: The dropdown menu currently contains the filters, and some information about the subreddit including our ruleset. We're planning to expand it with links and shoutouts to some of the smaller communities out there.

 - The Wiki: The r/battlefield wiki is well up and running. Skitrel has been hard at work adding content to it. We plan to continue to expand it in the future.

 - We have also been working on smoothing out the design with RES night-mode, along with adding special flair for the EA / DICE redditors out there.

I want to thank the other mods here for working their ass off the last couple of weeks. /r/battlefield has not only gotten a huge design overhaul, it also has more functionality than I thought would be possible when we started.

Special thanks goes out to Deimorz for assisting during the implementation of his awesome moderator bot.

1370109240.0,62,self.Battlefield,1fh21a,[BF4] The 3 Things I Want MOST in the Next Battlefield Games,by_a_pyre_light,77,15,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1fh21a/bf4_the_3_things_i_want_most_in_the_next/,"1) **More/varied environments**- I ***REALLY*** want some good jungle environments ala Bad Company 2, Vietnam, and Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising.

2) **A full Day/Night Cycle like JO:TR had**. I remember how amazing that was because it really impacted the gameplay. 
Read this description from the *Gamespot* review:

&gt; Meanwhile, the accelerated day/night cycle is an *excellent feature because it changes the dynamics of the map* in a natural way as the battle carries on. At night, it's harder to detect *someone crouching in the tall grass*, so you have to slow down and take your time. We've also seen instances of players flying *strafing runs in the helicopter with the setting sun at their backs*; anybody looking up to locate where the fire is coming from gets *blinded by the sun* *(I'm sure we can relate to this in BF3, huh?)*. At night, there's usually enough moonlight to see without night-vision goggles most of the time, but it can still *get fairly dark, necessitating the use of the goggles, which transform the darkness into an eerie green*. It's cool to view combat at night, as the flash of muzzle fire and tracers are amplified through the goggles in a realistic way.


See how badass these changes were? That's what I'd like to see. Crysis 1's multiplayer had day/night cycles too and they were great at changing the feel of the maps. 

3) **Inclement weather that actually impacts gameplay!** Snow should be harder to walk on, slippery to run on, and make your character cold, which makes reflexes slower and aiming a little more prone to drifting as your muscles struggle to operate in the cold. They did a bit of this in the single player campaign of Bad Company. Having some sort of environmental, timed element ala Metro, where you can't be outside for too long or your breathing becomes labored, and your goggles fog, and you need to get inside to warmth would be cool. 
Same for the driving, cold rain seen in Grand Bazaar. Maybe make it blur your goggles some, or fog them slightly ala Metro Last Light? That would be good. In between action, your character could wipe the goggles with a sleeve. 

If they don't do this, then it's all just window dressing like Alborz Mountain, and it doesn't really depict what conditions are like in those situations, which, IMO, is missing a lot of immersive gameplay opportunities.

We've just had a major UI overhaul in here, and still have a tonne of things planned, so we figured we'd let you know what we've been up to and what's on its way very soon!

We've just added specific flairs for user communities as well as some unique flairs. This means the guys over at EA/DICE will get unique flairs to identify themselves, Skitrel is currently waiting on Crash to get back to him with a full list of EA/DICE staff on the subreddit, Crash assures him the internal email is taking time to get around the studios as everyone is so busy working.

Community flairs refer to some specific Battlefield reddit communities, mainly for servers. They're coloured green to differentiate them from other communities and allow them to support and represent the place they love to play. The current list is as follows:

 - HUGS - /r/freehugsbf3

 - PURE - /r/purebattlefield

 - PSBF - /r/PS3BF3

 - CMW - /r/cmwgaming

 - EAUK - This is a special tag for the Mordor guys to represent their fallen love, the EAUK forums, now known as MordorHQ

We also have custom submission buttons that allows you to tag posts with the respective games ( like [BF4], [1942], etc. )

This leads me to what will be coming soon!

We're going to be adding filters so you can choose what content you want within the subreddit. Only want Battlefield 4 content? You got it. Only want Battlefield 1942 related content? Done! This will be as easy as clicking a sidebar link to take you to the necessary prefix. It will filter the subreddit so that ONLY content from a specific game will be visible.

We're going to add a dropdown menu with content like links to other communities, servers, newbie guides, specific game guides, and much much more. Skitrel is liasing with the competitive community to see what the subreddit can do to support the (hopeful) growth of competitive battlefield.

Wouldn't it be cool if we had death animations for when we are in vehicles?

Instead why not show it spinning uncontrollably down towards the ground in cockpit view and you ( the pilot ) panicking etc.. Add the option not to watch the animation if you have to go change something in the spawn menu. Cause seeing the vehicles turn black after being destroyed isn't exactly awesome..
Just an idea.

To this end I think the following would be welcome changes to make:

* Can be levelled up and equipped in the same way as attack vehicles.  The first two equipment slots should have equipment similar to other aircraft: Stealth, Maintenance, IR Flares, ECM, Air Radar, Proximity Scan, etc.

* Third equipment slot should allow you to specialize your transport helicopter's role.  Some examples:

  * Medivac - Heals passengers

  * Resupply - Resupplies passengers and nearby soldiers

  * Gunship - Gatling guns (should be disabled by default)

  * Transport - Additional passenger spaces

  * Recon - MAV-like proximity scan

* Points awarded for:

  * Dropping passengers off at an objective.

  * Picking up wounded passengers.

  * Healing/re-supplying/passenger kill assists/spot assists depending on specialization.

* Associated ribbons, medals, assignments, and dog-tags.

* Ability for soldiers, perhaps just squad leaders, to call for a helicopter without looking at one.  This request should come over the pilot's radio and be highlighted on the battlefield.

* Ability for passengers to request, using spot, which objective they wish to be dropped off near.  Total number of passengers wishing to be dropped off at each objective should be shown on the objective markers for the pilot and passengers.

* Optional voice communication between passengers and pilot (this would be great in all vehicles actually), and a means when in-vehicle to toggle this.

* Optional direct voice communication with the solider that has requested a pickup when you're near to that location.

What do people think?  I really think that these changes would not only improve play for people that love flying helicopters, it would improve it for infantry too.",Battlefield 4,False,self,t5_2rdgw,False,bf4,,True,t3_1gjvol,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1gjvol/bf4_transport_helicopter_suggestions/,

1365397858.0,55,self.Battlefield,1bwfkd,[BF4]I'd like to see some changes in jets for BF4. (kinda long),cml1of4,67,12,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1bwfkd/bf4id_like_to_see_some_changes_in_jets_for_bf4/,"Current opinion of jets is extremely divided.  Some people absolutely love them while others loath them.  My current problems are accessibility and ejecting.  

Accessibility refers to the ability for inexperienced players to use jets.  If you are a jet noob and you try to fly in most public servers, you will be gone rather quickly by a jet pro without any experience gained.  I'd like to see BF4 have a practice mode similar to BF1943 on the Xbox and PS3.  All it was was an empty map with targets scattered throughout and every vehicle there for you to practice.  

My problems with ejecting lie in denying the other pilot a kill, and the lack of accountability in a jet.  Now before you jump all over me, I still think there should be ejecting; however, I think it should change.  Ejecting should work as is when the jet is in good condition although I would like an ejection animation; however, if the jet is disabled, I would like to see a % chance that the ejection seat is broken.  Maybe something like 40%.

The other aspects of jets in BF3 I like so far but there are still some things I would like to see implemented for them in BF4.  I really want the thunderbolt and frogfoot on conquest maps with flankers and super hornets.  I know there would need to be balance issues but maybe 1 flanker/hornet and 2 frogfoots/thunderbolts since jets main focus should be ground especially on rush/  I know that is extremely open ended and full of wholes but I would love to see it implemented.  What are your thoughts?

The game had been moving at a fast pace, and things were not looking good for us. The enemies were pushing **hard**. Before we knew it, we were on our last MCOM. The fight was intense. The action was all centered on that one spot. Everyone was getting peppered with fire; there wasn't a second my screen wasn't blurred. Everywhere you look, there was an enemy shooting at you. 

Backed into our corner, getting fucked up the ass by 5.56s, that's when it all turned around. We weren't going on god-like killing sprees, we weren't raking in points, but we were *surviving*. We did it because every single team member was active and contributing. We had every angle covered. We were putting two rounds down range for every one that came our way. Medpacks and ammo crates were flowing like a waterfall. If you went down, you could bet your ass a medic would get you back up. 

Before we knew it, they were down to their last few tickets. It was incredible. None of these soldiers were exceptional, hell, they were average at best. As far as individual player skill, our enemies were probably better, they had pushed us so far back already. Yet we defeated them.

I think of it like this: One twig is easily broken, but a bundle of twigs is strong. In a 1v1 with anyone on the top two thirds of the enemy scoreboard, I would probably get crushed. My teammates probably wouldn't fare much better. Yet we all stood together and clutched it in the end.

The Battlefield series has always had these distinct moments. Weather it's running through a field and just staring in awe at the chaos around you on the massive map, or weather it's being locked in those big, intense firefights.

This would do a few things:  

- Slow down the rate at which revives can occur
- Remove the ability to quickly move the camera around while reviving focusing on a need for a player need to scan the area first - it would be nice to have a little bit of camera movement while in the animation
- Remove the ability to quickly cancel the revive, shot enemies, then revive 
- Create a really cool revive animation
- Greatly reduce the amount of 'revive knifing' 

It seems like this would almost stop rambo revives and make medics focus on eliminating enemies before reviving.  This could increase the amount of squad wipes and allow for greater ability to move up on a map.  It would also be nice to see the points for being spawned on increase to reward players for staying alive to give their squad a place to spawn closer to the combat areas.

DICE are smart, they have attracted essentially two types of gamer. The more infantry based 'arena shooter' and the team playing strategist. They can cater to both with TDM and smaller Rush and Conquest games to 64 player conquest - all in one title.

TDM is great for working on gun play and trying new weapons but for those of us who like a more open ended battlefield with strategy and command, It would be cool to see the game expand in a more RTS fashion. Now the commander is back, let me give a vision of a game-mode that could exist in a BF title - and would like your feedback on such a game mode/game , if not BF then another title.

So what would it look like? 

Well, it would just be a different game-mode within the game, alongside TDM, RUSH, Conquest etc. Let's just call it 'Headquarters'.

It would start off similar to the way conquest/conquest large does. Both teams have a deployment and a set amount of vehicles in the beginning. There's flags, just as usual - everything seems the same.

Only all your progress from your ranking up in other games? All your unlocks? Gone. Each faction has their base weapons so you have a shallow pool to chose from in your loadout, and no vehicle unlocks either, at least in the beginning. 

It will be the role of the commander to bring these elements to his team during the course of the round. 

The function of the flags will be to gather resources/credit as well as bleed enemy tickets (to set a match timer) Games could be won by enemy teams tickets reaching zero or by blasting the doors of the underground HQ/air craft carrier (like rush or Titan) and taking out the commander sat by the command console.

The flag points will generate a stream of credit to the commander's funds, which she can spend on anything from sandbag bunkers, artillery, boats, bikes, helicopters, defensive walls, tanks, AA positions, unlocks etc all the things we know in BF and more.
 
Squad leaders are able to make requests to the commander in what weapons/vehicles/unlocks are wanted by his squad. Anything the commander unlocks will be available for all players on the team and will remain so until the game is over. This included weapons/attachments.

There will be VOIP. The commander can communicate with anyone, listen in to any squad comms, view anyone's perspective, talk to the entire team, talk to all squad leaders, talk to individuals etc 

So instead of the game having a set list of vehicle spawns at certain locations - the commander deploys vehicles by purchasing them with credit. This just opens the game right up in my opinion, as varied and cool as BF is just now with different types of vehicles etc. This would add an entirely new strategic element and not the same old mirror imaging in vehicle spawns we have currently. There will be caps put in place to avoid things becoming overpowered (e.g to stop 20 jets destroying) and as usual balance adjustments will be key priority to an enjoyable game.

In order to spawn vehicles the appropriate building would have to be constructed. E.g a dockyard for spawning boats/jet ski's, heli-pad for helicopters, airstrip for jets etc. This would all be excecuted from the commander's table top view

How far would you like to see BF go in the RTS direction in a new game-mode? Do you like the idea of the commander purchasing vehicles but not the idea of constructing buildings first? Would you like a game-mode in which both teams start off with the bare-essentials and over the course of the round, more is unlocked by the commander, or should players keep their weapons and unlocks?

I feel frustrated with the re-hashed CoD the last few years.  There has been some *neat* things here and there, but nothing game changing.  Watching the cooperative gameplay in the BF4 trailer was almost jaw-dropping.  

I play nothing but Domination in CoD and when I played somewhat competitively I played S&amp;D in CoD2, but now a days on the PC BO:2 is a freaking ghost town and people typically don't give a crap about the objective.

The mod has been getting a significant amount of press, [PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/07/31/battlefield-2-mod-project-reality-gets-v1-0-release-date-and-trailer/) featured it, while [Pixel Enemy also posted the announcement trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQRJ8xbTnTs&amp;lc=hTytgz7ocE56-3SgtrONQ2wtKlcWxBJpfy9tkITQ0kg).

For a community that typically only numbers up to a couple thousand online at any one time this poses a particular worry. Project Reality is not a simple game, it is a complex game that requires a large amount of teamwork and communication. Squad Leaders will often assume that squad members know what they're doing and this leads to problems when squad members do not announce that they're learning the ropes.

As such, many veterans in the community are going to be taking on newbies for training. Essentially all this means is that vets will be acting as patient squad leaders for squads of people not familiar with the game in order for them to learn the ropes as quickly as possible in a friendly manner.

I'll be doing this tomorrow, and for those I won't be able to take on I can put in touch with others that will be training people. You can also contact Wicca and others willing to take on the new blood here: http://www.realitymod.com/forum/f10-pr-bf2-general-discussion/121858-pr-training.html

Other vets present, please consider putting a comment down here for people to get in touch also.

* Rudimentary night-vision/IR
* Fewer weapon customization options

...but replaced with:

* Interchangable ammo types (gotta love that DU!)
* Strategic bombing/shelling (destroy bridges, roads, airfields)
* ""Signature"" technologies from the time... Stealth fighter, SCUDs, etc.


These battles would be LOUD, personal, and very messy. As an aesthetic, I'd like to see burnt out tanks and other wreckage stay on the map until the end, creating that sort of ""Highway of Death"" feeling.

It doesn't have to be in the desert, and it doesn't have to include Iraq. They've been pretty liberal with creating fictional present-day battles with Russia, China, the EU, and the middle east, so why not in an older historical situation, too?

As you might have noticed there have been a update to /r/Battlefield today, no it's not an april-fools joke :P this is the updated design!    

I've been hard at work during Easter making this new design that have some new features and a more connected feel when it comes to colors and text that still fits well in /u/BloodSpillXXT original design and art direction. There will be more features and updates in the future as well but this is a nice start :)   

As always with website updates there are bugs, misalignments, and all that other fun stuff. I've checked the design over several browsers and with RES on firefox and it should look okay, but if you see anything please provide a screencap and tell us what browser you are using and I'll get right on it!    

Also feel free to leave us comments about the design as a reply to this post!

In the original Planetside these were a huge part of increased immersion, as they also are in Halo. Having recently played Far Cry 3 I'm even more set on the idea that this needs to be in the game. The first person camera and animations in that game are by far the absolute best I've seen in any FPS game to date, the immersion they achieved is phenomenal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtik1UDpRWA

I know the animations seem like a really small detail, but it adds quite a lot to the game, everytime I magically enter and exit a vehicle instantly I get taken out of my body a little bit, in a first person game everything ought to occur via the first person. If I'm getting into a tank I should clamber on top and jump in through the hatch, ending with the looking at the little display inside. If I'm switching between seats in a jeep my character should climb out of his seat and into the gunner position.

In addition to this, from watching Far Cry stuff closely, there's a lot of really minor things the camera does that sucks you into the perspective a lot, little wobbles of the camera based on bumps in the road, leaning left/right indicating gforces, zooming in and out to denote acceleration and speed. I really feel like it's some sort of benchmark for what first person games should be aiming to achieve.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my opinion and see how others felt about this, I rewatched the Fishing In Baku footage and noticed he instantly jumps in and out the jeep. I had hoped we'd see some awesome enter/exit animations make their way into the game. In singleplayer and coop they include these for the HMMVWs I want to see it for all vehicles.

Thoughts?

EDIT: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-X0UlZVUMk) also shows off quite a lot of the animations. It also includes one other thing I really love, he crashes a few times and you get to see just how heavy the vehicles feel based on the clever camera trickery. That's another thing I think fps games and in fact most games don't really get right, crashing never really feels like it ought to, these giant incredible heavy metal monstrosities coming to sudden stops. It's violent, jarring and most importantly feels heavy and impactful.",,False,self,t5_2rdgw,1365374900.0,bf4,hugs,True,t3_1bvo27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1bvo27/bf4_still_no_vehicle_enterexit_animations/,

Even in death, we all get the same animation like we had been killed dead in our tracks, falling right where we stand.

I've always wanted to have the explosions affect your character in multiplayer to add another aspect of immersion. If an RPG impacts near you, you get blasted back, falling to the ground. Depending on how close you are to the explosion, you'd take damage accordingly. When a grenade goes off under your feet, you'll be sent in another direction, dying on your way back to earth. I really want to see this in BF4, as it would add an awesome level of immersion that has been lacking in many games. 

If this is already a feature, or it was confirmed (I haven't followed that closely) then good on DICE.

None of my squad members were anywhere near each other, nor were they near an objective. They all had SQD AMMO and didn't really do anything to contribute to the game. 

One was sniping from an infantry inaccessible area with a spawn beacon to get back up each time he died, he went 2-7, with a final score of around 500. The next guy, a support, kept using the aforementioned spawn beacon to airdrop C4 and then suicided as soon as he hit the ground. He went 6-30 with a final score around 1000. Our last guy was even worse. He just crashed the transport over and over shortly after take off and ended with 0-21 and 70 points.

I thought I was just in a bad server, but it seems like every other one I joined was something similar.

Then, the other team was always just lined up with endless medics and just overwhelmed us like a horde of zombies.

If I'm wrong about this and you know a server where teamplay is encouraged, please let me know.

* Added a new header logo and banner to improve the visual feel of the subreddit.
* Added custom submission buttons with tagging to increase functionality.
* Added custom battlefield flair to increase subscriber customisability

And then there's tiny changes like making the subreddit, user, and content-choice bar black.

No one likes to die. It is probably the least enjoyable, yet at the same time most necessary part of the game. I was just think that instead an animation of falling over, you could instead see your death from a first person perspective as it appears the the guy who just killed you. 

Imagine being killed while parachuting. Instead of you just stopping and looking up, you actually fall as if your strings were cut. you keep falling until your screen turns onto the deathcam of the guy who just killed you. Or maybe you got shot while swimming, and you slowly sink to the bottom. Perhaps you got launched by an explosive, or shot while sprinting. I think it would lessen the rage of dying and very possibly make some laughable moments.

Of course, I don't know anything about programming. For all I know (and this is probably the case) implementing this would be near impossible. Still, I think it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. If anything, It would be nice to just change it from how it is now. Seeing the exact same animation every time you die is incredibly boring. Anyways, I just want to know what you guys think of this.

I'm not sure how much they used to cost, but nothing's really changed.

When you buy a game, you buy the game as it is at *that moment*. 

You have a choice to buy or not buy the things DICE would like to offer you. Everyone in the world would rather everything was free, but things have to be paid for -- and DICE has a right to charge for their *extra* work. It's not a DICE issue, it's not even an EA issue, it's just business.

There's also the weathered argument of video games being the cheapest form of modern entertainment there is. 

I've spent £64 ($101 USD) on Battlefield 3 and premium, and so far, in just under two months played for 114 hours. Not everyone plays as much as me, so to illustrate with a really conservative example:

If I bought it all **today**, and played an hour per week (~26 hours) until March 1st I'd pay, £2.43 ($3.84) per hour. Going to see a movie isn't that cheap -- neither is eating out, going bowling, going out to a bar for a drink or just about anything I can currently think of.

This becomes even cheaper if you *don't* buy premium, or had been playing since the game came out more than 6 months ago.

If none of the expansion packs are what you want, don't buy them, vote with your wallet -- but this ""deserving"" attitude on the subreddit is really starting to irritate me.

So, I have been playing Red Orchestra 2 and its stand-alone expansion, Rising Storm for a full month now. And man I have fell in love with that game. It does so many things better than Battlefield, and Dice should take a lesson from it. Now I am not saying Dice should copy-paste every single thing from this game and put it into Battlefield, but there are many details that should be changed in my opinion.

For those who do not know, Red Orchestra 2 is a PC exclusive hardcore WW2 shooter. It is extremely brutal - one shot kills if you manage to hit critical spots of the body (head, neck, organs, large veins.) It has many features which are included in Battlefield such as squads, commander, similar game-mode, 32vs32 fights, tickets. Many people say that it's a child of Arma and Battlefield - that is surprisingly accurate.

One of the things that Red Orchestra 2 does great is the Commander mode. [Here's a picture of Commander mode.](http://i.imgur.com/pU0YefD.jpg) 

Aerial recon is like a scan in BF2, but every team member will see those enemy positions. This is extremely important asset because you can't spot enemies the same way like in Battlefield.

Mortars, Artillery and Rockets are different type of strikes. Mortars are the weakest, but they are accurate, fast cooldown time and you have many mortar strikes. Artillery is more effective, but it takes longer time to deploy, less accurate and slower cooldown time. Also you have only few artillery barrages. Rocket Volley is a one-time use, massive strike on a large area. You will be extremely lucky if you manage to survive that.

Force Respawn is good if you need quickly men to the frontlines, and cancel artillery is good if you accidentally ordered a strike to a friendly position.

But the most important part of this system is that **squad leaders must mark strike spots.** This is done with binoculars. Just aim your target and mark it. There cannot be done any strikes if artillery marks haven't been marked. This forces players to do teamwork. Yes, commander can also place a mark by himself but he puts himself to a risk then.

How can this be implemented to Battlefield 4? Well, we already have a tool for this: Soflam. If you want a Tomahawk strike, then someone must designate the target first. Okay, Tomahawks aren't guided with Soflam IRL, but in BF other details aren't so accurate either: RPG-7 guided with a dart.. haha. Also, there are other laser-guided strikes IRL that should be implemented in the game.

These changes would make the commander powers less spammable, because they would require more teamwork. The current solution, flag-specific powers in my opinion isn't really good, expect maybe for AC-130. But I am not sure either if AC-130 was a good idea at all.


One thing I also like about Red Orchestra 2 is that there are class limits. Most of the people get a bolt-action rifle with iron sights as a primary. It's very effective weapon if you learn to use it, but you can get yourself in trouble at close-quarters against an SMG.

You have other classes such as assault which have SMGs, machine gunners, anti-tank soldiers, flame-throwers, engineers, squad leaders, snipers, elite rifleman (semi-auto rifle) and a commander. There are usually only 2-4 available slots per role. Also, not all roles are not available on each map, or even not on each army.

Squad leader is a special role. He is a mobile spawn point for his squad, he has smoke grenades which are EXTREMELY important on offensive push. He can also mark those artillery marks as I mentioned before. Japanese squad leaders also get katanas.

Now how these could be implemented to Battlefield 4? Restricting classes might be too much, but some certain weapons should be powerful, but limited. Stinger for example should be one of these. Why should everybody have a direct counter against aircraft? Because everybody can use them, they have been re-balanced all the time in BF3. Before the patch they were weak as hell, but after that they were overpowered and after that they got nerfed again. It's a vicious cycle of OMGPLZNERF circle-jerk, and making these things restricted could solve the problem.

I would also like to see sniper class being powerful but only like 2-4 snipers per team. Many people disagree with this, so it might better that it would be untouched.

Squad leaders in other hand, should be given special roles. Yes, they are the only spawn point (or are they? I can't remember if this is confirmed), but that is not enough. Remember that Soflam thing that I was talking about? Squad leaders should have exclusive access to this. Smoke should be squad leader exclusive too, but since people underestimate it and rarely use it, I do not think that is not necessary.

In it the commentator said how certain features of the commander mode have not yet implemented into the multiplayer, and are not featured in the e3 demo. One of these features is the supply drop, which is used to replenish ammo for vehicles. So, dice must have made the e3 demo have ammo regen since there were no supply drops to support vehicles. The commentator also mentioned that vehicles in the game have limited ammo (even though he is, at this point in time, technically incorrect.) Furthermore, that also explains the weird ammo regen system.

I'm completely new to the whole battlefield franchise. I have played one or two games of bad company and a little bit of 1943 but it never got me to not go back and play Call of Duty. Battlefield 3 has completely surprised me in every way.  It has made call of Duty look like an arcade game, plus Modern Warfare doesn't seem to be any different from the others. I wasn't even going to pick it up but after playing it at a friends house, I knew I had to buy it and I am glad I did. It has almost everything that I wanted from call of duty. I love how it is very team oriented and one guy can't go 26-0 to get a nuke to win the game. The implementation of suppressive fire, kits and squads make for a more realistic experience. Plus, I LOVE LOVE LOVE how no one runs around with a bolt action sniper rifle trying to get a 360 degree spinning headshot while firing it from the hip.

Now, after all is said and done, I come across a slight problem: ALL of my xbox friends except for a select few are now playing Modern Warfare 3.

Sorry, got to vent. Its the EU release today, we have been through all of this with BFBC and BFBC2 yet I keep seeing the same old crap in every game. If you put NO effort into defending/destroying the M-Com stations in rush you WILL lose. 

I'm really enjoying the game so far but it really gets my back up when someone just jogs in unopposed, plants and charge and doesn't even need to defend it as nobody is trying to stop them. Just me, apparently.

Anyone else see this regularly?

1371679643.0,21,self.Battlefield,1gop57,I'd like to remind everyone to keep criticism on Microsoft for a couple of key reasons completely relevant to Battlefield 4,Skitrel,35,14,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1gop57/id_like_to_remind_everyone_to_keep_criticism_on/,"It's no secret that Battlefield 3 suffered from a number of awful weapon glitches.

These glitches stayed in the game for months, waiting for DICE to push out their large patches.

The cause of this, I believe, is due to patch fees. It costs an awful lot to push out a patch on the consoles, Tim Schafer is quoted saying $40,000 for PS3 and 360 combined.

We know Sony are changing their policy on fees for PS4, there certainly aren't any on PC. This leaves the Xbox as a key component in holding things back, the other systems WILL have to wait months for large super patches as a result of the one system that charges.

I really suggest that, for those that want to see DICE capable of releasing hotfixes on the fly to get rid of those pesky weapon bugs, everyone stay highly critical of their position on fees, and even not support them unless it is removed. It holds everyone back. The fact that they've turned around on these policies so far is demonstration that voices CAN be heard.

Remember, in a best case scenario where DICE push out hotfixes for everyone EXCEPT the Xbox One, that still means One owners will have to wait months for fixes while everyone else does not. That in my opinion makes the One certainly not the best system to be playing BF4 on.

I want DICE unhindered and I want what's best for gamers on all systems. You should too.

Below you will find all of the details I could think of for tomorrow's 24 hour charity BF3 stream for prostate cancer research. Please feel free to ask any questions about things I might have forgot to address.

The stream will start at 12pm EST on July 5th and end at 12pm EST on July 6th. We will be playing on the PS3. You will be able to watch me playing live by going to twitch.tv/colonel_buckwheat

Donation Page: http://www.razoo.com/story/Streaming-For-A-Cure

My grandfather was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and he is fighting to survive. Prostate cancer forms in tissues of the prostate (a gland in the male reproductive system found below the bladder and in front of the rectum). Prostate cancer usually occurs in older men. An estimated 29,720 people in the US will die this year because of prostate cancer and 238,000 new cases will be reported. If I can help to make a difference in the fight against prostate cancer then I feel obligated to do so.

I live stream Battlefield 3 on twitch.tv and I upload videos to my YouTube channel. My streams and videos are watched by many, and I think this could be a great way to spread the word and raise donations for a good cause. Please don't feel obligated to donate, but if nothing else spread the word to others who may. Please know that none of the money raised goes directly to my grandfather. The donations go straight to Zero - The Fight to End Prostate Cancer.

I have set up two servers for the event and I think other ones will be added before it starts. You can search for the servers by typing ""24 hour"" into the server browser. They will be marked as 24 Hour Charity Event For Prostate Cancer.

I know several people want to play with me so I will be switching squads, teams and even servers throughout the day. I plan on playing all of the expansions at some point and most of the game modes.

I have reached out to other YouTubers and asked them if they would like to participate in the event. You might be playing with/against Icemanauz, CloudedTruth, BadQualityTroll, Tobbles, SG3089, and AmericanWarfare among others.

There will be giveaways for donors throughout the 24 hour period. These giveaways will be in 6 hour blocks, meaning if you donate you will be eligible for the prize that is currently available in that block of time.

Unfortunately the minimum donation is $10. That is something I wasn't aware of until I had everything set up for the event. I apologize if anyone was hoping to donate less than that, but it wasn't up to me. That is Razoo's policy.

Donating $10 will earn you one chance for the random drawing giveaway. You can earn additional chances for every $5 donated after the initial $10 donation. (i.e. a $20 donation earns you 3 chances/ a $25 donation earns you 4 chances)

I found two sponsors for the event who have graciously donated the prizes that will be given away. Please check out their websites for some very cool Battlefield 3 items.

http://www.etsy.com/shop/MakeItUrz?ref=seller_info

http://www.etsy.com/shop/damonboreing?ref=seller_info

We will also have a mini-game at times throughout the day called Stab and Bag. I don't want to share the details on the game at this time, but it could lead to some unique prizes for the winner.

I have set the goal for the donations at $500, but I truly think that we can surpass that. I'm hoping that we can raise somewhere closer to $1000.

Please send me a message if you would like to help out. I'm currently looking for other people who would like to rent servers. I am also looking for people who have a mic and wouldn't mind playing in one of the alternative servers to let everyone in the game know what is going on. I hope everyone can spread the word on this event. We are less than 26 hours away now :D

[Here is a more detailed analysis of the proposed method](http://i.imgur.com/UsnPzp6.png)

So, I don't like how Battlefield 3 handles suppression.

Currently, it is linear, which means each near-miss adds a pre-determined amount of suppression, until the maximum is reached. The result is that you 'suppress' people every time you shoot at them. Which really isn't what suppressing fire, as a tactic, does.

So, I figured: Why not add a simple system that makes suppression require an *Intent to Suppress*. Basically, a way to determine if the player is actually attempting to suppress, or if they are just spraying and praying. The simple, yet effective way I came up with was placing suppression on a curve.

Now, the balance is built around the M16A3, being fired fully automatic from a distance resulting in a 33% hit rate.

The curve design is such that maximum suppression is reached at 25 shots, regardless of hit or miss. Meaning that each bullet increases the amount of suppression present on the player 1.212 times.

Furthermore, I arbitrarily set the accuracy loss for the suppressed player to 0.25% accuracy loss for each suppression unit (100 maximum).

The result is that the suppressed player maintains combat effectiveness until they are supposed to die. As soon as terminal damage (potential) is reached the curve starts to rapidly climb. If a player survives the terminal damage, they quickly become suppressed. Yes, this means a player that lucks their way into surviving will be screwed, however, this occurs at roughly 2 seconds of shooting, which means they had 2 seconds to drop the enemy.

In summary:

The reasoning behind the curve is:

* To make suppression a decision.
* To benefit LMGs (25 shots is 5-6 shots less than most ARs are capable of).
* To improve overall balance of weapons (as combat accuracy would remain mostly unchanged for the duration of a 'balance' engagement).
* To reduce the abuse of suppression (High ROF weapons in full-auto would be balanced correctly).


Edit: I just noticed ROF is off so the time calculation is not quite accurate. The damage is correct in the source data...

On the other hand, most hard core Battlefield players who have enjoyed and cherished the commander role in BF2, really miss that function.

I smacked into the side of the side of the ship after a firing a few bombs at it. Now my boat started glitching up and was ever-so-slowly rising out of the water right up against the carrier, when an idea popped up in my head. I fired 5 more rounds at the carrier and hopped onto the deck as it started sinking, as well as my boat. I started panicking when a plane spawned, so I got in and started freaking the fuck out. Then I managed to fly the plane off the end of the boat as the last of it disappeared into the water. Then I went to the island and got blown up. The End

How my BF2 got to Origin,Eduardboon,21,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1adm52/ea_can_be_great_how_my_bf2_got_to_origin/,"After getting in touch with the livechat support, which took me about 40 minutes, I was asked to give them my origin ID and Serial Key. After a quick check I was asked to redeem my key on the OLD EA DOWNLOADER page, which obviously didn't work. Before I could ask anything else I realised the EAD pop-up had closed the livechat window. 

*sigh*

I waited for 40 minutes again to get in touch with someone and explained what had just happened. He asked me again for the key and went to verify it. When he came back he told me that my key was invalid and I should not bother them with illegal material.

After sending him a link to my BF2 stats page he gave in and asked me to send him a picture of the game-case and manual with the key in sight. I did this and he replied with: I want you to call this number and tell them what just happened. 
I was baffled by this because he had just given me an Irish(!!) number. After explaining that it would be cheaper to buy a new version of BF2 he guaranteed me that I could call for free on Skype, so I did. 

After waiting 40 minutes on the phone (40's the magic number today gents) skype stopped the call and informed me that I had spend all my credit.. Well crap.

A bit pissed I opened up the livechat again. This time I had to wait for only 20 minutes before I could talk to someone. I gave him the case ID's of the previous chats and told him that I could not call to Ireland anymore but really wanted the game to be downloadable in Origin. He asked me my secret question and went away for 2 minutes.

He told me to refresh my Origin page and I saw the BF2 complete package on the My Games tab. 

He said that for my troubles he got me the complete package to compensate for the long waiting time, I also got a 15% discount coupon to use on Origin.

So that is my story about how sometimes things can work out if you remain civil and calm during the whole ordeal.

It's my first time touching sony vegas at all so don't be too hard, but still, don't be afraid to be tell me what's awful and harsh. But if you'd do so, please let me know thy solution to it and what could have been done instead! Thanks for reading so far! (Exclude the gameplay, ~~obviously~~)

* Do you have any tips or ideas where i can advertise my montage? Please let me know, it'd help super much!

I said that I would like to see a re-mastered version of our beloved Battlefield 1942 to be released on consoles and PC. I would like DICE to take everything we love from the original Battlefield 1942 game, improve it if they so desire, and build the game around the new Frostbite 3 engine. Imagine the favorite maps of Omaha Beach, Wake Island, and Midway re-imagined for the modern generation of gaming. 

I feel like some gaming companies and developers have just continued to copy and paste successful games, slap on a new title, give it a couple new features, and release it at Christmas time for $60. Instead of copying and pasting games that people will like less and less as time goes on, why not take games from the past that people absolutely love, like Battlefield 1942, fine tune them with a new engine and some better features, and sell that! I know I would buy a console version of 1942 for $60 and a lot of other people would too! I realize there is already a WW2 game for Battlefield on consoles called 1943, but you only get 3 or 4 maps and they are all from the pacific theater. Imagine the full game with 64 multiplayer matches on the beaches of Normandy, or huge areal battle over Britain. That is something I would like to see.

Like many gamers out there, I am sick of the modern/futuristic theme of games. As far as I am concerned they have beaten that horse to death after Call of Duty 4 came out. Why not take a beloved blast from the past, take a chance, and make a great game like Battlefield 1942 even better! I would like your comments on this matter.

* Maps looks gorgeous, they are huge, detailed, and full of vehicles to fool around. And the geography is interesting to create some conflict zones.
* Players are stupid. Having such a huge maps, we better teamplay sharing vehicles and trying to go together to the checkpoints, otherwise its impossible to accomplish anything. Like the blackbirds, they are meant to carry people, and I see them empty all the time.
* The super plane hovering the map is a nice touch, but its kind of distracting. its easy to kill, but if you dont do it you are going to have problems, and it respawns really fast, so at the end you waste too much time killing the plane during the game.
* New vehicles are nice, the quads are fun as in BC2, but the rocker launchers are more like a supermortar, it helps but people just got bored to shoot blindly.
* Its hard to frag and you expend lot of the time running from point to point, we better start using the ""I need a pickup"" and paying attention when we have a vehicle.

Specifically Co-Op mode. BF3's co-op was decent, though there weren't a lot of missions. I loved playing co-op with my friends, and I hope Dice doesn't screw anything up with it. I got to thinking, ""What if co-op was made for MORE than two people?"" I could just imagine an epic mission with two guys providing sniper support while two guys moved in as infantry. I also want a more optional, player-controlled way of playing co-op. Custom kit setups for example. Maybe you wanna go spec- ops style and move in with a suppressed weapon, y'know, go in for silent kills so the mission can run more smoothly. Or maybe you just wanna run in honey badger style with an M60 just for the luls. I want missions that'll keep me wanting to play co-op. I also just want more epic missions in general. Maybe more incentives for completing missions, not just guns. (this may be a stretch) Like double xp for an hour or two or maybe some gun/soldier camos. Also, instead of just going through the mission normally, why not throw in challenges? For example, complete the mission in less than ____ minutes or get a certain amount of headshots during the mission. Overall, I just want a revamped, more challenging and fun co-op experience.

Tracers are used in battlefield on all weapons to help people identify incoming fire.  With all the abilities to to spot, UAV, drone, and find people do we really need tracer rounds firing from every assault rifle, sniper rifle and pistol.  Removing these or making them an ammunition option would be great  for appropriate weapons.

By not having mandatory tracer rounds people could be more effective in flanking and you would think a little more when using an LMG as you will instantly give away your position.

But, I thought we could entertain a discussion anyways. 

Personally, I would want the story to be less of an action movie. I thought the fact that one man took down the antagonist via a chase scene through Times Square was a little corny. It was cliche. I want a story that is part of a larger campaign. A more realistic, gritty story. 

Now for the setting. We already know that part of the campaign takes place in Baku, Azerbaijan, so I think that the setting will be placed in the Middle East, which is unfortunate because I want a new enemy that isn't Russian or Arab. I would much rather have a story take place in South America. There are very few games that tackle that setting. Think about it. Islands, jungles, bustling cities, farms, small villages, and markets. These are great settings that would translate into multiplayer well. Not to forget that this is a new setting that will keep the game fresh. 

As far as gameplay, I want it to feel like all out war. I want to feel like just a small part of a much larger war, and I want it to be focused on capturing military objectives and not being a wanna-be detective like in Battlefield 3.

Explanations. ,BecauseImBad,20,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/12zmg5/legit_vs_non_legit_explanations/,"Hello reddit, So I am an avid BF3 player but over the last year I have been noticing that more and more players are accusing legit players of hacking. 

First I would like to start by saying Yes, There are hackers and yes, Hacks can be hidden quite well. You do not need to tell or show me that.

Now onto the point.

I am a fairly skilled BF3 player who gets more then his fair share of ""Hackusations"" and bans. I am not saying im some great player but I do understand the game pretty well. What I would like to do is create a small series of Video's that demonstrate and explain those non obvious events that sometimes set of your ""Oh hacks!"" alarm 

For example: I had one guy tell me that while in his tank he was killed with a .44 Magnum pistol. Sure that seems odd right? But now I can take that information and explain how it happens in a legit manner. (Play as support, place C4 on the tank, Shoot it with magnum) 

So what I want to ask you guys is this.

What do you see on your screen when you think someone is not playing fair?

Are your accusations based on his score? Movement? Knowledge of where you are? Accuracy? Getting mad and need to vent? 

Any input would be greatly accepted! 

Thanks

The Rush server is running a rotation of all maps from all expansions.  After a week or three, we'll post a community poll in /r/purebattlefield, and tweak our rotation so that the most popular maps come up more often than less popular maps.

See you on the battlefield!

I run a hardcore rush server on PS3 - I posted my server awhile back on the /r/ps3bf3 subreddit as well as their ""master"" server list.  

Shortly after posting my server, I was met with an influx of teamkillers - mostly people killing for vehicles.  Commonly, the response was (something along the lines of) ""Oh, sorry man, I didn't know you were the admin"" -- To which I often replied ""Fuck off, Perm ban"" -- I was met with threats of reddit posts reporting me as a ""badmin""

The funny thing is, of all the servers rocking the PS3BF3 tag, mine was the only one which was full 24/7.  It wasn't because of the PS3BF3 tag, my server had a queue constantly because of the rules I enforce and the atmosphere generated because of it - and you can fact check me on bfstats or by showing up and talking to the locals. 

I [posted about the people threatening me with negative posts on the ps3bf3 subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/1bs8et/apparently_im_a_badmin/) and was met with some awesome responses about how I'm a horrid admin and that I should ""expect to be teamkilled"" if I'm playing hardcore.  I also was the grateful recipient of a torrential downpour of downvotes. Apparently enforcing your own posted rules and calling out people who intentionally teamkill players for vehicles, or any other reason... equates to you being a ""badmin"" - I'm just curious if this community agrees with ps3bf3 about intentional TKers?

They are on sale again now [here for $5 each](http://store.origin.com/store/ea/en_US/html/pbPage.origin-deals).

I have really been enjoying both games.  BF2 still has a pretty dedicated community, but I have to say 2142 seems to be dying.  I've logged on to see as little as only 2 servers!  On a good day I might see 10 or 12 servers.  The worst part is that there are only 3 or 4 maps on these server rotations, yet I know more maps were made for 2142 :(  That said, I've had a blast, and I really regret not playing this game in it's prime.

I started playing Battlefield when Bad Company 2 was released.  To go back and play 2142 and BF2 has been an absolute blast!  I highly recommend both of these games; especially at $5 each!  I'll be playing these for years to come; assuming there are still servers to play on :(  Let's get more people playing 2142!

*EDIT: The sale is apparently only on until the 27th. Not much time left!

*EDIT 2: Looks like the sale is over :(  I hope they keep putting these old games on sale to get new players!

*EDIT 3: My only complaint about these older games is setting up resolution and punkbuster....

RESOLUTION FIX: Setting a custom widescreen resolution cannot be done in the graphics settings of these two games.  Instead you have to create a shortcut to the game .exe file and modify the shortcut properties.  [Details on how to do this here.](http://www.tweakguides.com/BF2142_9.html)

PUNKBUSTER NOTES: I've installed on two computers, and both times I was getting kicked constantly by punk buster.  Turns out the punkbuster installation included with these games doesn't work.  You can [download a utility called 'pbsetup'] (http://evenbalance.com/index.php?page=pbsetup.php) which will help you update to the latest version of punkbuster (there's a ton of tutorials on the net for this).  I also had trouble getting PnkBstrA service to run in windows services, so I also had to [download punkbuster's service installer 'pbscv.exe'](http://www.evenbalance.com/index.php?page=pbsvcfaq.php).

I really don't like multiplayer.

I believe the map was Azadi Palace.  I was an engineer with the ACW-R, SMAW and repair tool. My friend was a medic with the F2000, medkit, and defibrillators.  

So he gets killed and I avenge his death.  I picked up his kit to revive him, and I get to him just a few moments before it would have been too late to revive.  However, when he gets up, he still has his F2000 and I have one as well.  When he checks his equipment, he has the defibrillators, but he has a SMAW as well.  So for the next few minutes I try as hard as possible to keep him alive because he just became a freaking super soldier.

I revived him again a few times using the kit I originally picked up when he died and he still had the defibs/smaw combination.  When we finally both died and had to respawn, he had several revives and had killed a tank with my SMAW! It was the coolest thing ever.

So you remember how BF: Bad Company 2 had a nice big expansion called Vietnam? 

Well, I thought that *maybe* DICE &amp; EA could revisit Battlefield: 2142, with the same concept. 
Not a whole new game mind you, just: 
* 3-4 maps from 2142 
* A few new weapons from 2142
* And some new vehicles, from 2142 
* All future-oriented, all only accessible when playing the expansion pack. (just like BF:BC2: Vietnam)

Now of course this would-be expansion would get released after End Game, and even into next year, but I think it would be nice to give us something to hold us over until whatever the next game in the Battlefield franchise is going to be. (BF4, probably)

They would see a rise in returning Battlefield players , and a rise in income. 

So who's with me? Leave a comment or suggestion, I would love to hear your ideas; that's why I came here in the first place!

I was pretty frustrated at first, but gradually improved until I was usually in the top 3 on my team, and often had 2, 3 or 4:1 K/D ratios with a fair number of captures. BF3 I seem to be all over the place. I'll have what feels like a really lucky round where people seem to just line up in front of my crosshairs once in a while, going maybe 2:1, but most of the time I find myself getting killed over and over in quick succession, then maybe crawling up to 1:1 by the end of the game. Situations where I die 1-2 seconds after spawning if I spawn anywhere other than the uncap.

I'm almost at the point where I want to start using fraps on all my games, because I swear I'm hitting people, then see they're still at 100% after I'm dead. That's the kind of crap that led me to stop playing Modern warfare after COD4.

I get stuck on invisible collision fairly often, usually leading to a death, and I can't count the number times I've been stuck not quite being able to vault something, where you get the vault animation but don't go over the wall.

Respawns result in a black screen for 1-2 seconds, so if you spawn on a teammate you appear blind while enemies can see and kill you...

Finally the teams. I'm not sure if this is a result of the stupid web interface (who thought having to restart the game to change servers was a good idea!?) but the team balance has been generally attrocious. I had a lot of good even games in BC2; narrow wins and narrow losses. BF3 seems to generally be blowout games so far, and statistically you're more likely to join the losing team as people jump ship. 

Was BC2 this buggy and unbalanced when it first came out? There are plenty of other games out right now, I could go play them for a while and come back in a couple of months? Or am I the only one feeling this way about it?",,False,self,t5_2rdgw,False,,,True,t3_m73wq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/m73wq/was_bc2_like_this_at_the_start/,

The problem for me came when I realized how poor the performance would be on older machines.  As someone that has played PC games for a long time, it wasn't really surprising that the game would push current top of the line hardware to the limit.  The disappointment came when neither of my systems could run the game well on the lowest settings.  
In my opinion, Dice has always had a problem optimizing games to run well and look well at the same time (hello Battlefield 2), but the fact that I had problems running the beta on low was surprising.  Yes, it is a beta.  I know what a beta is.  At the same time, the BFBC2 beta was playable and impossible for me to stop playing when it hit.  
I hope that if I wait a month or two for BF3, a patch or two, and driver support will make the game run well on older hardware.  If anyone has any tips or if the game performance was improved during the beta, please let me know.  Some of the benchmarks I have seen however are frightening to me.  For reference, here are my specs:
i7 2630QM
Radeon HD 6770M
6GB DDR3-1600

yes, I know this is a laptop, I was hoping to play on at least low.  A poor college student like myself can't afford to build a rig at the moment

1317215395.0,11,self.Battlefield,ku1jr,"Battlefield 3 Open Beta Mini-Review: What Are Your First Thoughts? (Warning, WoT)",blue_gatorade,13,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/ku1jr/battlefield_3_open_beta_minireview_what_are_your/,"So, I wanted to see what everyone thought of the open Beta. Knee-jerk reactions, glitches, whatever. Obviously this stuff should all be posted to whatever forums EA has set up for feedback as well. 

Here goes:

**On Battlelog**

The interface is nice. It would be better to have it in game, but the flow is surprisingly smooth - on my PC, by the time I got the ""go to game"" message, the game would just pop right up. Load time was pretty fast for me.


I'd still like to try running the game from the Origin browser, as it can be pulled up from in-game. Time will tell.

**On Gameplay**


The Good:


During the Alpha, I frequently heard that gameplay just ""felt better"". I found this to be the case. Reg was great as far as I could tell, and the recoil is phenomenal. 


Unlocks are fun, and the weapons all seem pretty balanced, as far as I've seen. I haven't played the (ammo dropping?) class yet, but classes seem more appropriate to their jobs now: 


-Medic doesn't have a super OP machine gun, instead opting for a light rifle. Paddles now take a while to execute, so you need to clear the area first.


-Engineer is a blast. Submachine guns are lethal at close range, instead of the derpy silenced things they were in BC2. Rockets feel much better, and the damage reg is phenomenal. Haven't used the tool yet, obviously.


-Sniper is sniper. I was afraid prone would make it super OP, but the glare in the sun from scopes makes them easy to spot. Not sure yet if scopes lose glare if a sniper is well covered, looking to test this tonight.


-Knifing takes longer! Like paddles, there is an animation involved. I haven't seen a ""save"" yet, but it's really cool when you sneak up on an enemy that's prone, and your soldier lifts him up off the ground, stabs him in the chest, and pulls of his tags. I thought this animation was great.


Destruction is great in general. Have to do some ""rocket noob"" testing tonight to see what I can and cannot destroy. Notable wins were minor walls and glass, but while defending the last set of objectives, I tried to blow up a van to give myself a better line of sight and it didn't even take damage after three rockets. It should at least have exploded :)

Overall the game is a blast, and I can't wait to play the full version. Unfortunately, I feel I should cover...


The Bad:


With all the foliage in Metro, prone makes players nearly invincible. If your team isn't retarded, you can set up an invisible ambush net around the first set of objectives. This clears up in the second two sets of objectives.

I(and others) noticed issues of clipping through the floor when moving uphill in prone position. Hopefully this will get resolved, it was pretty irritating.


Prone characters look like dead characters. The profiles are far to flat to the ground, not up on the elbows. I saw quite a few ""zombie kills"", where prone enemies would ignore players until they ran by, then stand up. I'm not saying they should be marked, but a little bit more of a profile would be good.


It would be nice if my character wouldn't vault *everything* I try to jump over. I understand this isn't Assassin's Creed, but sometimes my soldier would vault things he could step over.


Also, weapon switching by side - I'm not sure if it's just a reskinning or just for defaults, but your weapons are chosen by what side you play(AK vs M4). On second thought, this might just be for stock weapons, but the two are NOT clones of each other, and feel remarkably different.


These are very minor gripes, sure, but things I hope get fixed or accounted for in the final release.


**Interface**


The menu and class select system, as well as the text system, are similar to Bad Company 2, with a few key changes. You now have the ability to change your permanent layout and weapon enhancements in a second menu. I was both excited and disappointed to see this, as it feels kind of COD-y.


The unlock system is kind of strange. It behaves just like the old one, but there were quite a few times when I *thought* I had unlocked something, but it wasn't there in my inventory. I think this might have to do with the game showing you what your next unlock will be whenever you unlock something. I think I may just need to look at it more. Not game breaking, just odd.

Things that seemed glitchy were:

-I couldn't use the chat feature while dead. While this is okay in that I shouldn't be able to shout warnings, my text would just vanish into thin air when I hit enter. I either shouldn't be able to type messages, or shouldn't be able to send them to nowhere when I'm dead. The strange thing was I could send text during killcam, but not during kit selection. Hm.


-The escape menu can only be accessed while you're alive, which doesn't make any sense. I spent half of my first game asking people how to change setting like a noob, because I was trying to do it while kit selection was up. The menu disappears when kit selection comes up as well.


A quick note on graphics - The game is freaking beautiful. Awesome textures, super smooth, everything. I started out on high, I had most settings on ultra on a GTX 580 and I had no noticeable lag. 


So, what thoughts do you all have?

a little background on me: i just graduated high school and will soon advance to broke college student status. i currently work a minimum wage job at a pizza joint and have saved ~ 5000$ for the next year or so. im an avid battlefielder and fully intend on getting the next game however im not sure which platform i want to get it on. either way im upgrading from the playstation 3 which i currently own.

as far as paying for everything goes i fully intend on selling my playstation 3 to help pay for it (im not sure how much i could get but ive heard around 75$) as well as i already have 250$ in cash from graduation money that has not gone into my savings account. 

so here's a few of my thoughts as to the pro's of each:
PC: 

* better graphics

* better fps 
* better community (sorry console gamers, but when i played on pc i didnt do nearly as well as i did on ps3)

PS4: 

* cheaper. this is a huge selling point for me just because i really want to get the best gaming experience for my dollar. like i said, im a broke-ass college student

* also going to have 64 player servers and comprable graphics (so I've heard)

* going to be able to play all of my old ps3 games

so there's my situation and my thoughts on the matter. I would love to hear some advice from the battlefield community as to which route i should take!

For those of you who don't know me I go by the name of Big Mac.  I'm a long time Battlefield player who has been in and around the competitive community for a while now.   I'm here to let everyone I can know about a really cool event we have going on this Sunday at 12:00PM EST.   That is 6:00PM CET! 



Level BF is hosting the **Level Battlefield 5v5 Invitational.**  What this is is a multi-continent Battlefield tournament.   Level and our awesome sponsors have helped to bring together the top 16 teams from North America and the top 16 teams from Europe into two awesome brackets that come together for a NA vs EU final.   We will be **live casting** matches using a **free-cam** system for folks to enjoy and watch.  

Between the prizes generously donated by our sponsors and donations from many of the volunteers helping to run this tournament we have amassed a prize pool worth well over $3000 dollars which is HUGE for BF3.  

[Here is a link](http://invitational.levelbf.com/) to the Invitational's website for everyone to check out for details such as the tournament bracket, tournament rules, and of course the prizes. 

We have top NA teams like Nexus, No Mercy, and So Awesome as well as top EU teams such as UNIVERSE, siXFinns, and webSPELL.  


This tournament will run from the opening rounds THROUGH the finals starting Sunday the 23rd at 12:00PM EST.  So come check out the matches live-casted by Daskro, BrettFX, Driftaholic, myself and plenty of others.

We have FOUR live-casted twitch streams for you to enjoy.  Two following the NA bracket and two following the EU bracket.    And we will have two streams watching the GRAND FINALS between the top NA team and the top EU team.   These streams provide an AWESOME perspective using a free-cam system.  

* [Stream Alpha](http://www.twitch.tv/levelbf)
* [Stream Charlie](http://www.twitch.tv/levelbf_charlie)
* [Stream Delta](http://www.twitch.tv/levelbf_delta)

Keep in mind that these will not go live UNTIL 12:00PM EST Sunday.  That is NOON for you folks that like to sleep in :P  



This is a really neat event thrown together by a bunch of folks that just really love Battlefield with the hopes of helping to spur Battlefield as an eSport.   I wanted to let as many of you know about it as possible because so many people put in a ton of hours over the last few months and we'd really like as many folks to enjoy this thing as possible. 

We're hoping more events like this can become a standard for the Battlefield franchise and your support helps show DICE how much we love some good ol' Battlefield action.  

Thanks for watching folks and I do hope you enjoy it.  If you do get a chance to watch some of the matches please leave feedback both in this post and in the twitch chat.  The more feedback we can get from you guys the better!  We want to continue to do these and your feedback helps tremendously.

Day 1 - **Suppression** - Now focused on LMGs, suppression no longer has an effect at close range also.

Day 1 - **Tank Smoke** now shoots into the air and starbursts similar to:

http://i.imgur.com/mmDmlLJ.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/Qse5n.jpg

Day 1 - **Ammo** - Everyone is always out of ammo, people are reloading often and ammunition in the clip is discarded.

Day 1 - **Health packs** - There appears to be two health packs, a big and small one. -**new** small packs throwable?

Day 1 - **Auto leaning** - Far Cry 3 style

Day 1 - **Sliding** ? Not certain

Day 1 - **Water** You can now dive underwater - sidearms usable in water - Water appears volumetric - Sprint swim

Day 1 - **Defibs need recharge**

Day 1 - **Spectator mode** - Appears comprehensive, able to view whole map view, all players on both sides marked, select players from map view with picture in picture. Third and first person. Scoreboard selectable also.

Day 1 - **Vehicle damage** - ~~Vehicle tires now blow~~ Debunked by executive producer today. - Disabling appears reworked, Venom goes down to 4 health with no repairs but starts regenerating.

Day 1 - **Assists** - High assists now count as kills

Day 1 - **Recon balls** - Bad Company 2 recon balls are back.

Day 1 - **Flashbangs**

Day 2 - **Incendiaries** ? It looked like an incendiary grenade of some sort, phosphorus? Or an anti vehicle grenade?

Day 2 - **Support grenade launcher** - Appears to have launcher as well as sidearm and primary lmg

Day 2 - **Cannot building ride**

Day 2 - **Specialisation progress bar decreases when you take damage**

Day 2 - **Zeroing sights** - Can change sights angle to adjust for range and bullet drop.

Day 2 - **Sprint** - No longer unlimited

Day 2 - **Scope sway** - Changed/removed ? Unconfirmed

Day 2 - **Pistol with compensator attachment** [Unconfirmed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1g7thu/bf4_livestream_thread_day_2/caho391)

Day 2 - **secondary attachments**

Day 2 - **range finders**

Day 2 - **Stick c4 to boat sides from water**

Day 3 - **Squad specializations**: Called the bro bar internally, You choose your own specialization ""path"", if your squad gets wiped you only lose the progression towards the next specialization but not the specialization you have at that moment.

Day 3 - **Gadget customization**: Some gadgets look to be cross-kit, others not. M320 and C4 are examples of cross-kit gadgets. Engineers can also carry mines instead of an RPG while carrying a repair tool. Assaults can carry medpacks as well as M320s. Recon and Support both have C4 as a useable gadget.

Day 3 **Auto Leaning/peeking CONFIRMED** - farcry 3 style. Only spoke about leaning OVER cover not around? Side not confirmed, top definitely confirmed.

Day 3 - **Defib/torching enemies will be back**

Day 3 - **Underwater knifing**

Day 3 - **DMR for all classes confirmed**

Day 3 - **Muzzle break** - less recoil, more spread

Day 3 - **Mounted iron sight would replace lasers** - unconfirmed

Day 3 - **Angled grip** - better initial recoil

Day 3 - **Foregrip** - better movement while aiming

Day 3 - **Climbing ladders looks faster**

Day 3 - **Knife swipes are in**, recovery may be a hair faster than BF3?

Day 3 - **25 point melee bonus**

Day 3 - **Vehicle mobility hit is worth 50 points**, could be similar to a disable
at 7:40 the tank is destroyed while underground, by the commander of the other team. Before that kill is shown you assume that the tank was C4'd... the obvious answer is the tomahawk, so maybe it has the ability to pierce ceilings? Or, just heavy splash damage.

Day 3 - **Can still reload while sprinting**

Day 3 - **Vehicle Spawn Bonus 25**

Day 3 - **Squad Spawn Bonus 50** (not sure if these last two are always linked when a squad mate spawns on you in a vehicle) - a regular squad spawn as infantry is still 10 points

Day 3 - **Controllable shuttergates confirmed**

Day 3 - **""Critical Damage / Low Power"" on the tank HUD when taking an RPG to the rear** that brought health to 45 - HUD goes static-y at dangerously low health (16)

Day 3 - **A multi kill was worth 200** in addition to the 100 x 2 for the kills for a total of 450 points with the vehicle destroy

Day 3 - **Yes, snipe scope glint is staying in**

Day 3 - **e-sports** Zh1nt0 talks about esports being much bigger.

Day 3 - **4 spectator slots per server**

Day 3 - **Limited repair tool?** Probably needs double confirming

Day 3 - **Helicopter ammunition** - Different ammo for attacking infantry and vehicles

Day 3 - **Counter attacks** - Weren't put in the thread on day 1, probably should have been. Thanks for the public shaming Dunn ;)

Day 3 - **Spectator hotkeys**

Day 3 - **Entering and exiting vehicles now requires holding the key for a few seconds next to the vehicle** - As opposed to being instantaneous as it is now in BF3.

This is also seen clearly in the Battlefield 3 campaign, I forget the mission. Why didn't they put this in multiplayer? It would've made the tank capable of holding one more person, and it would also enable snipers to pick off the third gunner. Possibly the third gunner could have a duck action that would hide them from snipers, unless they're directly overhead of course (like in CoD WaW, remember how fun it was to shot the gunner out of the tank?).

Tonight on PS3 my team and squad was getting obliterated by a couple of choppers. I don't normally carry stingers but I got fed up and equipped one. First lock on I got a double kill and all sorts of accolades for ruining streaks, destroying vehicles, etc. Nice vindication there.

Ok seriously the post is at +1700 replies and we have yet to have any confirmation from dice. I've reformatted my pc over 3 times now which solved nothing (and I goto school online, reinstalling Photoshop\Illustrator, moving over all my files I have to backup is way to time intensive for me to be pulling fresh reinstalls every other week). I've upgraded from a gtx 460 to a gtx 580, I've upgraded ram from 4gb to 6gb, I've switched between new Nvidia drivers and old legacy drivers.. Nothing fixes it, I'm still at 15fps on medium settings with a q6700 oc'd to 3.2ghz, 6gb ram, 80gb intel ssd, gtx 580, and xfx 680i sli mobo. I can fire up Metro 2033 and play with everything maxed at 30-50 frames on 1680x1050. I went from using the pre-specified ""automatic"" settings at a stable 70+ fps to switching to medium\low and receiving no fps increase.

Dear Dice, this is completely wrong. The more destruction that is available the better. No one will care if a specific building collapsing would give the other team an advantage. The most fun I have ever had in a Battlefield game was during a game of rush in Bad company were the end result was a near flat map.
 
So please, let us destroy everything. First thing i saw in the stream was a tank firing at a infantry soldier behind a pillar, nothing happened to the pillar and the soldier was still alive and well, this is not how I would like this game to be.

What I noticed is that I'd get a lock-on that would go on for ages without anyone firing.  Then, it would stop.  And about 15 seconds later I'd just explode - no missile launch warning or anything.  

From what I understand, to have a Javelin target an air vehicle, it has to be done via laser designation.  When this is done, do you not get the missile launch warning that you would get when, say, a Stinger or Heat Seeker is launched at you?

Thought I would let you know that we are opening up a new sub for Battlefield geared towards people who play on PlayStation. Currently we have /r/ps3bf3 with nearly 4000 subscribers, and I know of few people around here are involved in that community. With the news of BF4 in the near future, we wanted to borrow a page from /r/battlefield and make a sub for all Battlefield games on PlayStation. This way people wouldn't have to subscribe to a new channel each time a game was released.

I have been talking with /u/Skitrel to help borrow some of the code from this sub and we are setting up a similar filter system for tagging posts with the correct BF game.

When.. After that my game didnt start for while. It started when I disconnected my second monitor but crashed when I press to Login to my account. 

After a while I gave up and tried to play Battlefield 3 round but I ragequitted that and tried to play Battlefield 2 again. Well now I got to the main menu and into server browser.

This is how I see it, when a teamplayer revives me, he does NOT get his Points until I've acctepted it (this means he only get's his Points when I'm finally up on my feet again).

DICE said theyd have artillery in BF3 but it didnt happen, sow what do you want!
If your idea was inspired by something specific, state from what so others may get a better understanding of what you wish to convey.

My ideas:
Inspired from PR mod for BF2 and the BF3 Alpha testing and the US Army.

SQ spawning works like the BF3 Alpha, er like BF3 HC as the BF3 alpha spawning was broken.

As for what Squads are, I would keep BF3/BC2s ""squads"" but rename them fireteams and spawning works as above, but the FTl may only spawn on the SL and the SL may only spawn on his specific Fireteam. 8 men, or 2 fireteams forms a squad, which the SL can give orders to FTL's who can give orders to specific individuals (he is a FTL as well)
He, of course, receives orders from a Commander or Platoon leader or whatever.

SLs would also have the ability to place HMG's MK19s TOWs and Mortars down, 1 at a time of course, and they are useable like any other vehicle, by any team, it would take some time to set up so its fair.
As such Squad mates could request a certain one set up at certain points.
IMO these give squads importance, while keeping choices open to the player, and promote teamwork as the SLs have abilities others do not have and can be very influential in the tide of battle.",,False,self,t5_2rdgw,False,bf4,eauk,True,t3_1c14b9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1c14b9/bf4_how_can_we_make_sls_useful_in_bf4_my_ideas/,

We all would like to see more squad customization, waypoint/squad leader/commander tactics, ability to rename squads, game-VOIP, server info in menu/scoreboard, a chat-log, more team player incentives, etc. If you are playing with friends in a party you should be able to lock your squad so you will always be with you're friends and won't be a victim of auto team balancing. They need to streamline it so when you join a server it auto-connects your friend's squad and other useful features.

More than just a tournament or league, you fought with the same teammates week in, week out on a persistent meta-world where you could capture territory.  The forums and Teamspeak all played a part in the fantasy where you were not a gamer as part of a team, but a soldier (with a rank and qualifications) as part of a unit (which was part of a larger unit, part of an army).  They also charged something like $10 per tour.

===

That said, it's kind of poorly maintained and not well advertised to the outsider, and as far as I know, they don't have any plans for BF3.  I'd really love to see this type of organization in a Battlefield 3 league, and I figure reddit is the place to possibly start this type of thing.  

==

I would be more than happy to buy a domain, install some forums, and create a basic ""about us"" type page, and really get something like this started.  I'm starting a Kickstarter page, since really doing this project right will involve more cash than I'm willing to front.  I'm not *really* looking to make any money from this, just to share the experience I had with others, so I'm toying with how exactly to fund something like this (without charging participants).

=

Any ideas on what I should do, what you would be willing to do, why this idea sucks, why I suck, and so forth would be welcome.  I'm a fair hand with web design and administration, but **if anyone would be interested in being a moderator/helper/designer/whatever type person, send me a message with your qualifications.**

Legality questions/answers would be appreciated as well.

1. what is best against helicopters? On some maps a skilled heli pilot can win the whole map. Can I kill a helicopter with my assault rifle?

2. Can I kill a tank with a handgrenade? Does it even damage the tank? Do high-damage rifles like submachine guns or sniper rifles damage a tank? (light tank?)

3. Do anti-tank mines disappear after some time? Can I only deploy a certain amount of mines?

4. What is the best way of gaining experience points for each class? (duh)

We were running around on foot and just outside the building site. A light tank surprised us by getting really close to us, and since I was recon and he was assault and we were in the open we did the first thing that came to mind and ran at it. Being just a couple of feet from it, it started to reverse away to try and get a shot in. The guy reversed out of the boarders of the map and when his time ran out he died with us laughing hysterically :P   
   
BF:1943 (xbox 360): Possibly the best thing about this game was the unlimited dynamite :D Me and a friend spent a good few hours playing Guadalcanal. We would spawn and straight away make our way to the enemies base. Since 2 planes spawned in each base, I would put down my 3 dynamite on one plane and he would put his on the other. Then as somebody got into the plane and flew off, as soon as it passed the end of the runway we blew it up (there it counted as off the base so we got points). Depending on which base it was or if we had time, we could get into the towers at the end of the run way for an awesome view. Now I think about it this probably was a bit of a dick move, but it was just *so much fun.*   
   
BF:2 Project Reality (PC): Playing insurgency on some map for one of the first time with a friend, also trying to drive a motorbike for the first time. I hadn't realised the mouse was used to balance it so I was failing so much. After like 5 minutes of trying I finally got it going by a fluke and was slowly making my way to the exit of our base. As soon as I turn the corner into the gateway out a US SUV slams into me, both of us blowing up.   
   
BF:BC2 (xbox 360): This time it was rush on Arica Harbour. We were attacking and I was having fun sitting waaaay back at our spawn area, sniping all the enemy snipers and guys on AT guns, having gotten used to the bullet drop quickly. I was sitting on top of a slight hill, tree behind me for background. It was at this point I noticed a guy on the AT and as I positioned my scope I noticed that he had fired a missile which was coming directly for me. Without hesitation or any mistake, I got a perfect headshot on him then sidestepped that fucking missile with half a second before it hit me, it barely missed me. This is probably the time I felt most bad ass in a battlefield game ;)   
   
I've had so many great times playing battlefield games it's really hard to recall them all, these are just some of my greatest and most memorable :) I would love to hear some of yours, I really enjoy reading some awesome moments people have had (the ""From the front lines"" section on the Project Reality forums is great for this)",,False,self,t5_2rdgw,False,,,True,t3_hnu7s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/hnu7s/just_a_few_of_my_personal_favourite_bf_experiences/,

* To me skyscraper collapse doesn't seem quite 'meaty' enough - it settles down way too quickly. IMHO the aftermathcollapse should last longer, raise more smoke and water, shake the ground, and overall have more impact that even players on the other end of the river can feel.

* When in spectator mode you're focusing on a squad - you can't tell which team they're on because their icons are green. Maybe make icons appear in team color, but have squadmate's names appear in green?

* 3rd person view for spectator mode should feature adjustable zoom and ability to manually rotate the camera.

* A great addition for machinima makers would be ability to adjust camera angle and position in 3rd person view, relative to the character. For example, behind-the-shoulder view, under-the-wheels view, and other custom angles.

* ""Explosive"" icons appear for rockets and flares, which I think looks very informative on the minimap and spectator mode, but a bit odd when you're actually playing. IMHO explosives icons should be removed from the screen (but not from the large map) when you're playing, so it's less distracting.

* **Destruction animation for jets and helicopters!** Please, don't make them just fall to pieces like an old car, it looks very weak and boring. Make them spin and go out of control just before exploding, like it happened in Bad Company 2 or even in that chase scene in BF4 single player. 

* The amount of verticality on Siege of Shanghai is great, I really hope to see more maps feature this kind of variable elevation. Please don't blow all your load just on that one map.

* Jeeps would be more useful if driver was also the gunner, like the Vans in Aftermath DLC, or like boats in BF4. Give driver the ability to use the turret, while passengers could shoot out of the windows, or possibly even out of that second hatch on the top of the jeep.

* Jet gameplay will be great on Siege of Shanghai, with skyscrapers creating lots of cover. If jets aren't going to be featured in conquest version of this map - please make them available in Air Superiority version of that map.

* Don't know if it's planned or not, but I'd like to see more types of helicopter &amp; jet weapons, different kinds of missiles and rocket pods. Also gadgets that change maneuvrability of jets in some way, like hard brakes, smoke screens, afterburners, so that jet combat becomes not just about speed control and turn fights.",Battlefield 4,False,self,t5_2rdgw,1371075384.0,bf4,BF2142,True,t3_1g5wye,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1g5wye/bf4_battlefield_4_prealpha_feedback_and/,

That is, when a squadmate spots an enemy (or fires at one if nearby), not just a marker appears on the enemy -- a dotted line from your mate's original LOS to the target appears for a few seconds. 

This can appear for as long as the target is being looked at (down the sights) by your mate, and disappear gradually if the target goes behind cover or instantly if your mate is shot or turns away.

For an example of what I mean, [here is a screenshot](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mBmyK3XZnvs/TcKGo_iS-MI/AAAAAAAAAS4/aYs4SWf7teY/s1600/mgs4%2525204.jpg) from MGS4 showing enemy LOS on the UI. It's the thin line coming from the left. It's not the best shot or example, but hopefully those who played the game know what I mean.

Why?

* Add more awareness to what your squadmates are doing.
* Another layer of information for the player.
* Much more useful than the ""dorito"" when it comes to responding to incoming threats.
* Makes it more likely for squadmates to work together and not scatter their efforts.

With this feature in place, you can remove the team-wide 3D spotting, or limit it in different ways to maintain balance.",Battlefield 4,False,self,t5_2rdgw,False,bf4,ppc,True,t3_1fq4xn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1fq4xn/bf4_idea_how_about_taking_3d_spotting_in_a/,

**THE BACKSTORY:**
---------------------
We are Battlefield gamers since 2002, when Battlefield 1942 was released. But our all time favorite Battlefield game is Battlefield 2, with which we made [.::quite a few Machinimas::.](http://bit.ly/VQpcni) during the last years. 

During the last years, CoD became a real phenomenon, breaking it's own sale records year after year.
Because CoD is such a cash cow, EA *(and other publishers)* try to change pretty much all of their first person shooter franchises, to make them appeal to the CoD fans, in oder to get more sales.

While I can understand that plan from a business perspective, I totally hate turning franchises into something the name never stood for.
Anyone played *""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier""*, or seen the next *""Splinter Cell""*? Even BioWare said that they wanted to have *""DragonAge 2""* appeal to CoD fans. :S

If publishers want a piece of the CoD consumer cake, then they should just create a new franchise to do so!
And not ruin their existing franchises for their original fanbase.

So up until Bad Company, Battlefield and Call of Duty, despite both being FPS, did not have a lot in common. 
Starting with Bad Company, EA&amp;DICE went a new, more casual/arcade way. That was all perfectly fine! And actually would follow my suggestion to create a new (sub)franchise.

So all was *fine*, until Battlefiel 3, the advertised *""true successor""* to Battlefield 2.
When we look at Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield 2, then Battlefield 3 clearly does not follow the old gameplay and gamedesign. 

**So do not get me wrong here! Battlefield 3 is mostlikely one of the best shooters available!**. But it is also a casual shooter from top to the bottom, which had a **lot** of the features removed that once made Battlefield 2 so special. And this is what this movie is about. :-) 

During the last year there were many petitions, articles, blogs and videos made by *""Battlefield Veterans""*, explaining how much richer the experience was in the old games, and showing that there are still a lot of players who are in love with that kind of game.

So there was that. And we did not want to do any *""documentary""*. :-)

In February 2012, we then started to wonder: *""What would happen if you throw an Battlefield 2 player directly into Battlefield 3?""*
And this is what we now did in Battlefield:Crossover. We tell the story of an Squad Leader who suddenly finds himself inside Battlefield 3. 
While at first being fascinated by the visuals and sound, he soon starts to discover that this is no longer his Battlefield anymore.

---------------------
**PRODUCTION:**
---------------------
We had the first idea in February 2012. Then we started to write a basic script, which (as always) grew and grew.

For the Battlefield 2 scenes I created a modification to make shooting the screens easier, but to also highlight the mod support Battlefield 2 has - and Battlefield 3 has not.
There were 3 scenes for which I needed a greenscreen, so I built a mobile one inside the modification, which I could then use anywhere on the map. :D

Shooting all scenes took about 28 hours in total. Battlefield 3 is much more exhausting and frustrating to shoot because it does not have an demorecorder like Battlefield 2 has.

The most time was then spent on the post production. The editing, CG effects, audio effects and all the voice acting.

I can't even estimate how many work hours we put into this. But it will be well above 240 hours.

What I do know quite exactly is what the movie cost me. ;-)
BF2&amp;BF3 Server rent, software, hardware and music licensing costs pile up to 497,- Euros *(or 649,78 USD)*.
