I may have seemed upset, I couldn't understand why you wouldn't lend me a lighter, I was off work and just wanted to light my cigarette up, and I couldn't find mine. *Why would they treat me like this?* But then it hit me: You were scared. I was wearing a hoodie and it was dark outside, the streets were empty and I was on my old rickety bike. You probably didn't want to unzip your purse and allow the possibility of a stranger robbing you.

It hit me that women still feel scared and vulnerable on the streets at night and still are, to this day, often victim of men who prey on them.

(as in, 4-6 hours a day). 

A lot of people ask me what it's like. Some of them are curious about trying, some just want to know how it works.  

It's a good question: How does that busker playing your favourite song as you enter Peel Metro end up there, and not get his spot taken, and how much does he make? The structure for busking is both fantastic and complex, though I know people who would call it impotent and complicated. I can write out a post laying out all the rules and etiquette that a good beginner busker would benefit from knowing, as well as some stories of my experiences underground.

Would you do me the favour of commenting or upvoting if you're interested in a post like this? If 5 people do that, I'll write it all out.

Edit: Oh shit. Whoops. Hahahaha. Definitely didn't know it would be interesting to so many people. OK, I will start writing the post today and there will be an AMA element. Think of questions that you have always wanted to ask.

Feel free to add to them.*


 * **RULE #1**: Never, ***EVER*** use your turn signal.  To use your turn signal is a sign of weakness, and you are NOT weak.  You are better and more important than everyone else.  Never forget that.

 * **RULE #2**: Pedestrians are fucking scum. Some of them seem to even think that they have the ""right of way"". Adorable, right?!  Seriously though, you own the fucking road.  Just go - they'll move out of your way.  If someone ahead of you is slowing down  or even stopping for pedestrians, honk your horn.   If they give you the finger or something similar, that is just them admitting how dumb they are.

 * **RULE #3**: MINIMUM speed on all roads is 30 km/h faster than what those ""maximum"" signs say.  Those signs have no idea what the fuck they're talking about.  Ignore them.  If you're stuck behind some LOSER going slower than you, then you must tailgate him and do everything you can to make him feel like shit since he is slowing YOU - THE KING OF THE WORLD - down.  Flash your lights at him, jerk your steering wheel around, even honk if necessary.   If all else fails, you can pass him in the right-hand lane or even on the shoulder of the road.  Make sure to stare at them with ""FUCK YOU"" eyes as you pass them. 

 * **RULE #4**: If you are on the highway and your exit is coming up soon, you must wait until the VERY LAST MOMENT before you switch into the exit lane.  (If you're already in the exit lane, what the FUCK are you doing? Get the FUCK into the passing lane.) Ideally, you will want to make it known to everyone already in the exit lane that you're speeding up ahead of them so that they know who the fucking boss is. (Hint: It's you). Refer to rule #1 for instructions on how to properly switch lanes.

 * **RULE #5**: If the person sharing the road with you drives a less expensive and/or older car than yours, then FUCK THEM. Seriously. They are clearly POOR and WORTHLESS, and should be treated as such.  Speed up and cut them off at all costs.  Rule #1 is crucial when dealing with these pieces of shit.

 * **RULE #6**: If you're stuck in any kind of traffic, you must CONSTANTLY change lanes to gain every microsecond of advantage that you can.  The moment the lane next to yours is moving and yours is not, cut into that other lane at all costs.  Those people behind you that you are cutting off and slowing down are less important than you.  FUCK THEM. Never forget rule #1.  It is #1 for a reason.

**Note:** If you're a taxi driver, then you most likely do all of these things perfectly already.  Bravo to you, sir.  Bravo. http://i.imgur.com/Vb4g4.gif",,False,,t5_2qnmr,1368712724.0,,,True,t3_1eg7ab,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1eg7ab/rules_for_driving_in_montréal/,

The Good:

Everything was peaceful,though I could feel a lot of tension. Cops were pretty passive. I heard them declare the protest illegal three times, but since no one was really doing anything from what I could see, they didn't do anything either.

It wasn't clear who or what was directing the protesters path. It seemed to me the cops tried to keep protesters onto large streets and the police weren't about to let anyone on st catherine street.

I saw someone giving the middle finger to a helicopter, and someone else telling him don't do that, wave the peace symbol instead

Everytime the group marched past a row of riot police blocking off a street, most people flashed peace symbols.

Full blown riot police marched the entire way with the protesters, but did nothing but walk. I got out of the way of them, and one said something and ended the sentence in mon ami, without much of an aggressive tone. I don't know what he said, but I think he was referring to the buldge in my hoodie where my camera was staying dry. Possibly because the cops obviously can't tell if it's a concealed weapon or not.

I heard five explosions. Not sure if they were firecrackers or police flash bangs, but while a few cheered the explosions, they were quickly drowned out by a loud BOO from the group then subsequent chanting saying this a peaceful protest.

The Bad:

Despite the cops passiveness, many people still felt the need to chant ""No justice, no peace, fuck the police"". A completely unnecessary chant. It was more than just a few who chanted this.

When the group started moving up St Denis into the plateau, it seemed the police were ill prepared for it. None of the side streets were blocked off, still lots of traffic on St Denis. At some point the police finally managed to clear St Denis to make room for the march, but again, the police seemed to have problems securing the protesters route.

The police declared the march illegal almost as soon as it began. This made me nervous as I found it very antagonistic. According to the media people were throwing bottles at the police, but I didn't witness it, so *shrug*

Anti-austerity protests shouldn't be so indulgent with their marijuana. I'm far from being an anti marijuana person, but it's still a luxury item.

The Ugly:

Myself, along with 10/20 other people, while on sherebrooke, moved in front of the group to take photos of the banner being held. I got threatened by some bald douchebag in a black trenchcoat. Telling me ""No proof for the police, WALK AWAY"", giving me that deadly stink eye type look. What an idiot. Pretty much every single person in that group, every single person the group walked past, had cameras. I trust this person and people like him, are mentally damaged in some way.

I saw a small little asshole puncture wheels on two bikes. Just like that, no reason, no point, one would hope he gets removed from society somehow. I won't comment on the means. He was part of the group.

Someone at Hurleys while the protest was going down crescent street, started yelling bad things at the group from the upper terrace. A bouncer quickly rushed in to shut him up.

The Interesting:

Different parts of the city had different reactions to the group. St Denis bars were in support, high class clubs on st laurent? Not so much. Sherebrooke hotel people looked on like it was a circus, and people on crescent seemed to think it was just a party. I don't think anyone on mount royal ave was happy about finding themselves suddenly stuck in a giant group of angry 20 somethings. I wonder if a lot of the supportive honking I heard was actually out of fear.

The funny:

A 24 bus driver honked in support, the people on the bus did not look pleased. A 55 bus driver took the opportunity to have a smoke break.

A few times, the protesters had no clue where they were going, and started splintering. Some people would start chanting to regroup in order to fix it

Conclusion:

This one may have been peaceful, but it's obvious that there are more than a just a few bad elements within the movement. The anger directed to a passive police force was completely unnecessary and antagonistic and served to do nothing at all to help the movement. I really do think that the protesters are not doing enough to clean house, and disassociate themselves from the groups and individuals who ultimately cause the trouble in the first place. Yes, they flashed peace symbols all over the place, and chanted loudly that this a peaceful protest, but one just has to look at the crowd and listen to the needless anti-police yelling to figure out that it's a larger minority then some would have you believe.

It was also obvious, by the size of the march, how long the march lasted despite bad weather (I left after they reached crescent and rene levesque, that was 4 hours later), that this movement has not lost steam at all. I think we will be stuck with these marches for a while yet.",,False,,t5_2qnmr,False,,,True,t3_sv7br,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/sv7br/walked_with_the_protesters_last_night_my_take_on/,

If we really want to make a difference, we will when it really counts- the election.  Voting is the most important thing you can do - more important than the protest Montreal had yesterday. 

There is a very good 99% chance the tuition increase will go ahead as planned, so make sure you remind them about it when you get the chance to vote them out.

Imagine seeing voting stations lined up with the amount of people we saw at the protest yesteday. That would be amazing. All the effort that was put in to informing people, making signs on poles, handing out brochures- the same effort should be made to inform the entire young student population to vote. 

**You WILL see results** Even if you do not think any political party fully supports all of your views, you should choose the one that BEST represents you.

Just wanted to say you guys have a spectacular city. My girlfriend took me there for my birthday, and we ended up staying an extra night because we enjoyed it so much.

So much so, that we have been frantically searching for a way we could end up living there. Anyone hiring in the biotech industry up there??

Everything is done correctly: Great waterfront, VERY clean city streets (we're from Philadelphia though so pretty much anything seems clean to us), the Bixi bikes were awesome, food was amazing, etc etc etc. My favorite part was renting the bikes, riding up the extremely bike friendly streets (side note, it was depressing thinking of how awfully un-bike-friendly Philly is after seeing there were actual lanes for bikes in Montreal) to Mt. Royal, then down to the Biodome. Back to hotel, then out for drinks and poutine while watching some of the Olympics. Life is good.

Yeah, of course we did all the typical touristy things, but also explored around on the bikes looking for the nooks and crannies of the city. Every new area we went to, we found something we loved about it.

That's all, just wanted to say thanks for the hospitality, and for not being jerks about our broken French. It was funny how anytime I tried to say ""bonjour"" the person would immediately know I'm not from there and they'd just say ""hello"" with perfect English. 3 years of high school French did nothing for me.

If you recognize this person, please report him to the Montreal Police:

or by phone

514 393-1133

Please mention the crime happened on February 22nd in Montreal, at the Depenneur Centre on the corner of Centre St. and Island St. in the neighborhood of Pointe St-Charles. The local police station attached to this event is :http://www.spvm.qc.ca/en/pdq15/

EDIT: Crime took place on the 21st, my bad... 

EDIT2: The owner of the store doesn't know the culprit, he asked me to see if something could be done, the cops will likely shelf the report unless someone comes to them with fresh information. The store owners live in a different neighborhood... 

EDIT3: Most elderly people are lonely, by being friendly to the woman, the bastard managed to lower her defenses and take advantage of her. A real snake if you ask me.

EDIT4: Made a throwaway account, I rather not be identified because Pointe St-Charles (The Pointe) is like a small village and you never know who this guy may know...

I unfortunately didn't have strong friends to help me do this, so I went with ""professional"" movers. I chose to go with [le clan panneton](http://www.leclanpanneton.ca/), one of the bigger moving companies in Montreal. Unfortunately, things did not go so well.

The movers arrived. One younger, muscular guy, two older guys, one quite fat, one tall and skinny. They told me they couldn't park on my street, and so they would have to use the back entrance. Because the back entrance had spirally stairs, they said they needed to charge me a $175 supplement, but, if I agreed to keep it ""under the table"", I could pay them $80 as ""tip"" instead. I was not warned ahead of time that this could be an issue, and so I suspect this is completely illegal.

They then proceeded to move my stuff. There wasn't that much: about 20 boxes, one large desk, an office chair, two shelves, two dressers, a flat panel TV, a computer, some clothes. I was moving into a bedroom with roommates. The distance to travel wasn't much, I was only moving 2.5km away.

Well, it took them over 4 hours, at $125 per hour, to make this move happen. It seems to me that they were being slow and inefficient on purpose. There were several dead times during the operation. The total, with taxes, was $762. The fat asshole had the fucking nerve to tell me that he liked to be ""generous"" with his clients (referring to the $80 bribe they forced me to pay, supposedly saving me money).

For comparison. I had moved with La Capitale 2 years ago. About the same amount of stuff, from downtown to little italy, 3rd floor to 3rd floor, and the cost was $375. So yeah, le clan panneton are crooks, beware. You should probably be wary of movers in general. They hold your stuff hostage, usually require a safety deposit and have you in a very vulnerable position. Probably didn't help that I was a woman alone.

* Embracing different cultures and ethnicity while sticking to core values. ie: speaking french, BE Canadian 
* Preserving buildings rather than knocking everything down and developing condos
* People are very friendly and approachable 
* Fantastic nightlife.

It's pretty awesome, with a few expert sysadmins involved (and some programmers such as myself, and many other geeks). There's no money, so it's all volunteers.

The mailing list in particular is pretty active. If you want to help, it's cheap and easy: Just use an old router or a shiny new antenna to create a node (see http://mesh.openisp.ca/nodes/).

Also, you don't have to be a geek to benefit from the service. Some nodes already allow internet traffic (and of course upcoming mesh-only sites!). There's a lot of stuff still to be decided so if you get involved, your voice will certainly be heard.

En gros, le but est de créer un gros réseau comme l'internet, mais sans dépendance majeure (genre, sans Bell), au cas où l'internet deviendrait pourri (et parce que les gros ISP ont un monopole). C'est très cool et plusieurs experts de réseautique sont impliqués (et aussi des programmeurs comme moi et d'autres geeks). Très peu d'argent est impliqué, donc nous sommes tous bénévoles.

La mailing list est assez active. Vous pouvez aider facilement: avec un vieux router qui traîne ou une belle antenne à 100$ vous pouvez créer une node (voir http://mesh.openisp.ca/nodes/).

Finalement, pas besoin d'être geek pour bénéficier du service, car certains nodes vous donnent déjà accès à internet (et aux fabuleux sites qui finiront par se trouver seulement sur le meshnet).",,False,,t5_2qnmr,False,,,True,t3_pybdo,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/pybdo/montrealers_are_starting_a_mesh_net_des/,

This means that...,mricon,226,103,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/104v4b/canada_has_two_official_languages_this_means_that/,"... the **federal** government is constitutionally obliged to provide services to its citizens in both English and French. This obligation in no way extends to **provincial** or **municipal** governments, which are only obliged to provide services in the province's official language (or both, in the case of New Brunswick).

The fact that Quebec offers the majority of its services both in French and English is a *bonus*. It's done for historical reasons, out of recognition of its large anglophone community, and just because it's a damn nice thing to do. The [government of Manitoba](https://www.gov.mb.ca/index.fr.html), which has a significant francophone minority, does the same -- though not on all their sites. 

On the other hand, I invite anyone to find any content in French on the [government of Alberta's site](http://alberta.ca/).

So, please, let's stop going into high-kvetch mode the moment we find a gouv.qc.ca site that isn't available in English. French is the only official language of Quebec -- if you want to change that, then I invite you to write your MNA (and good luck with that).",,False,,t5_2qnmr,False,,,True,t3_104v4b,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/104v4b/canada_has_two_official_languages_this_means_that/,

We've had to deal with this pest for years. Still, with the new generation of Concordia students about to move into Shaughnessy Village, I figured a little PSA wouldn't hurt.

Especially since this morning 8:50AM I spotted 6 big ones and at least as many smaller ones scuttling about. They were around the bench closest to the Guy entrance, on the Atwater-bound train. Perhaps it was because of Osheaga but I've been noticing more fresh hipster faces sitting on the ground. So as advice to the new residents:

* Do NOT sit on the ground
* Do NOT leave your bags on the ground (unless they are hard shell)
* Avoid sitting on the benches (inspect them carefully first)
* Avoid leaning on the walls, or staying close to the walls

Guy-Concordia is a filthy station anyway so you shouldn't be getting comfy down there. And if a Montreal Gazette writer is reading this, how about a shock article to send the STM PR people in a tizzy.

When I got home from work, there were no parking between 7h and 19h signs everywhere (that were NOT there when I left for work at 8am), every single car on the street was gone and the asphalt had been torn up.  I figure, ok, they must have needed to do emergency work for some reason and my car has been towed, hopefully they didn’t give me a ticket though since there was nowhere near enough warning beforehand. (I later learned that my car had been towed at 10:26, and like I said, when I left for work at 8 no signs were up).

I call the city’s 311 line to find out where they put my car, and after 45 minutes on the phone being bounced around to different people, I’m told that they didn’t tow my car and that they have no record of ANY car EVER being towed from my street (despite the fact I’ve watched them tow cars from my street during snow clearing last winter) and the final kicker, as far as the city is concerned, there is no construction currently happening on my street (so.. what..  a pissed off contractor just came to take his asphalt back..?). 

The city tells me to call the police station since they may have towed it so I do and they’re in the same boat as the city, no record of any cars being towed from my street at all. The police eventually tell me my car was probably stolen and I should report it as such. I explain to the police officer as politely as I can that it would be one hell of coincidence if someone just stole my car on the day they tore the street up and put up “we’re gonna tow our shit” signs and that in my opinion  it probably wasen’t stolen the city / police just didn’t have their shit together. 

This all happened last night, this morning I start canvassing the neighborhood looking for my car and get back on the phone, again, first to the city, who tell me the same thing as yesterday: “We didn’t tow your car, we haven’t towed any cars from your street, there is no construction in our records happening on your street”. Then the police, same thing as yesterday, and now a more definite “sir, your car must have been stolen”, bullshit, I keep looking. 

I eventually find my car, dumped in a metered parking spot on DeMaisonneuve with two tickets, one for having parked my car in a spot “where parking was not allowed due to the placement of a removable sign” and the other, for being parked in a metered parking spot without having fed the meter.

Call the cops back to say wtf, give them the name and badge number of the agent that gave me the first ticked (the one that included the towing charge), cops tell me it’s not one of theirs, must be a city parking agent. Call the city, who basically say “yea.. wow.. that really sucks for you.. unfortunately once a ticket has been issued it can’t be revoked,  you’ll have to contest them in court”. 

Meanwhile, despite having the name and badge number of the agent that had my car towed, as far as the city is concerned, they never towed my car (it just magically transported 6 blocks) and again, there is no construction underway on my street.

So.. any ideas..? what can I do here..? what are my options? And can I lodge an official complaint against the agent that had my car towed but then didn’t bother filling out any of the paper work, thus making my car disappear into the nightmare that is the Montreal municipal government / cartel?


TL:DR Emergency roadwork on my street (that the city is apparently unaware of), parking officer has my car towed but doesn’t fill out any of the paper work (other than issuing the bullshit ticket). Dumps my car in a metered parking spot where it gets another ticket. City tells me they never towed my car, police say it must be stolen, I end up finding my car myself, with 200$ worth of tickets, PISSED OFF!

I have had it with the construction in this city. 

It has reached comical levels of absurdity and it seriously boggles me mind that people are not more outraged about this. I live in St-Henri, and it is now virtually impossible for me to go ANYWHERE outside the downtown core. I haven't visited my parents in a few weeks (they live in TMR and St-Laurent) because the construction makes it impossible to take the highway anywhere.

I get by taking the Metro to and from work since I work downtown. Aside from that, I can't go anywhere else. The 15 has been reduced to 1 lane, making it very difficult to get to Decarie. The 20 is accessed via the 15 from where I live, so forget going west. To get to the 40 I need to take the 20 to the 13 or somehow take Decarie up to the 40, and like I said, none of that works anymore.

The Turcot has been under construction for what seems like the last 5 years. I hear they are tearing it down in a few years, but for some reason they feel the need to repair it NOW before tearing it down. The 20 has been under construction my entire life. The Champlain bridge is always half closed...I was trying to get to Nun's Island to go play some golf and I gave up because the Champlain was actually impossible to access.

Last summer they tore up the entirety of St-Jacques to replace all the aquaducts. I found that curious because I remember them doing the exact same thing the previous summer. One day I asked one of the construction workers and he explained that the construction company that started the aquaduct restorations the previous summer actually went bankrupt, and they had no idea how much of the job was done and what was left to do, which is why they had to completely restart the entire project (which meant construction at my corner for 2 consecutive summers). The construction created a massive logjam on my street, making it very hard to access my vehicle.

There is an overpass on the 20 that is built but not currently being used. My girlfriend's friend's family works in construction, and I was told that the city hired 2 seperate companies to do this overpass...Each would begin at one side and they would meet in the middle. Well, when they got to the middle they realized that the overpass did not line up, and one side was 2 feet higher than the other, meaning it has to be torn down completely and re-built.

Parc avenue is inexplicably destroyed at this point, and yet the government is more interested spending money on renaming the street than actually focusing on repairing it.

Everywhere I look, there is construction. What isn't under construction is falling apart or unusable. It seems like the city hires people to build stuff and then tears it down right away. They are spending countless millions repairing the Turcot only to tear it down in a few years...And I hear that now, they will tear up the big park in front of Lionel-Groulx metro to turn it into a massive bus terminal to deal with the shit-storm that will be created when the Turcot is torn down. They JUST built that park less than 2 years ago! They spent I don't know how many millions building and renovating and landscaping that park and they are just going to pave over it! Are you telling me they didn't know this would happen back then?

Oh, and I hear the city actually RENTS those pylons. They RENT them.

The lack of foresight and the blatant, in your face inefficiency and corruption is astounding. I truly don't understand how the mayor and his administration, along with Transport Quebec and all the other infrastructure fat-cats in this province are not rotting in jail right now. It is unbelievable. 

It angers me so much that we are wasting so much money in this city and province on the most trivial bullshit. And what angers me more is that nobody even fucking cares. Some people even think our situation is something to be proud about. Nobody really gives a shit about municipal politics...Year after year this city keeps electing the same roster of crooks and we make jokes about it.

This rant might be turning into something else now, but this needs to be said. The other day I was taking a walk on the canal near the St-Ambroise brewery when I saw a sign with info about the old abandonned silos. The sign mentioned how these were some of the first terracotta silos in the city and that the entire factory has been abandonned since the 80's. The whole thing looks like it is going to fall apart and looks generally unsafe. But that's not the point...See, the sign went on and on about how important it is to preserve these abandonned buildings because of history and other bullshit. It said that there has been a lot of pressure to tear it down to build something actually useful, but that the city is fighting to keep it preserved.

This upset me because it made me realize that there is a government employee, likely multiple government employees, who are probably getting paid more than I am, who's job it is to ""preserve these structures"" which I can't for the life of me imagine being an actual job. There is no way in hell this is a full time job. There might be 1 day of work per month required...And our tax dollars are going to pay these salaries. 

Then, for that 1 day of work where they might do something, there are journalists deployed to cover the event for some bullshit local newspaper that is given away for free because nobody actually wants to pay for a subscription. These journalists write articles that nobody reads or cares about on the ""importance of preserving local buildings""....And since nobody actually cares about this stuff, they get their salaries subsidized by the government because hey, if the free market is unable to provide an adequate job for you, the government will step in and pay you as if you are doing a real job! All on the taxpayer's dollar!

I can go on forever, but I won't because this rant is already out of control.

**tl;dr** Sick of construction. Sick of wasted money. Sick of paying people for doing fake jobs. Sick of unions. Sick of special interest groups.

He provides context and explanation for why he leaked the report after he was mandate by the government to look into it.

Some interesting quotes:

""His political bosses clearly didn't care what he had to say. He testified that when he tried last year to brief his supervisor, the transport minister, about the findings of his investigation into the construction industry, the minister was coldly indifferent""

""He says then-transport minister Sam Hamad was staring out the window while he talked. He then says the minister refused to look at his report and that his assistants would deal with it.""

""""The members of this team didn't do this work to have (the report) sit on a shelf,"" said Duchesneau, saying he took full responsibility for the leak of a final draft. After my meeting with minister Hamad, I was convinced that it was heading for a shelf.""

Even if this corruption inquiry goes nowhere, good on Duschesneau for doing what he felt was right and getting this whole process rolling.

An Informative Story About Busking in Montreal,

There are buskers who have done it for longer. I asked them lots of questions during my time, and gathered all the useful rules and stories. Here is all that and more, in the form of a story.

If you just want the starting rules and etiquette, go to the wiki,

or just read the bolded and italic parts of this post.

[(You may want to throw on some Yann Tiersen.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ciqf8yMVzAk])

I arrived in Montreal in October. The weather was pleasant and my head was journey-light. My brother had secured lodgings for us in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. I dropped my bags off, took my accordion and headed into the Metro. 

So soon? But I did have a dream driving me. People back in BC asked me ""What will you do in Montreal?"" and I said ""Make 100 dollars daily playing accordion in the Metro."" It seemed reasonable.

Me and my friend K'esu headed to Berri-UQAM. There we met an accordioniste called Carolina who would be our first educator in the Regulations of Busking in the Metro.

**1) There are 55 signs in the stations of the Montreal Metro, with a [lyre](http://25.media.tumblr.com/1f546e50b63b57084b46e8f9a50c61ce/tumblr_mhprycuoi11rmd89qo1_500.jpg) on them. Under these signs, it is legal and encouraged to play music, without a licence, following the regulations described [here](http://www.musimetromontreal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=90&amp;lang=en).**

But at that time Carolina was there, playing her accordion. 
We thanked Carolina for stopping to talk and left, wondering: 

Who gets to play at a certain time? Is it won by force of personality? Do you pester them and say they've been there too long and it's your turn? Cringe. She had made mention of being a member of MusiMetroMontreal. Was that required? 

*does it cost money?*
*what do I have to do to be allowed to play?*

With this in my head, I went up the stairs to Rue St-Catherine, put down my case on the sidewalk, and played [and](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFKTvybgpsA) thought. I give places three songs before deciding to stay or leave. After three songs on the sidewalk in the October night, my fingers told me to go back to Berri-UQAM.

I found that the spot was empty. Carolina was gone. I glanced around, hoped for no trouble, nodded and set [up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X74qN9RCAAU). 

**2)If a performer is absent from a spot they've signed up for, *and* it's 30 minutes or longer since the time they signed up for, a new musician can take that spot. To secure it, they must write their name in place of the absent musician's.**

After a while, I'd made 10 dollars and K'esu came by to reunite. We played happily for a few songs and concluded that Montreal liked us, and we should go home and drink beer. Two girls, sweet as honeywater, came by just as we were going. Play us a song, they said. [So](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LULmbLlPvVk) we made time, of course.

*Many girls are attracted to musicians. I have gotten much attention and at least one number while playing accordion. They are obviously nuts and should be hooking up with accountants or somebody more financially stable. But, I like nuts.*

The next day I found the MusiMetroMontreal website.[If you want to busk and do well, read it. It's a goldmine.](http://www.musimetromontreal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=90&amp;lang=en) It also has a [list of every single busking sign in the metro system.](http://www.musimetromontreal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=92&amp;lang=en). A busker who knows this website will be a very well-informed busker.

I was still unclear on who could play where, though. Somebody told me to go to Sherbrooke, so I did.

When I got there, [Maelstrom](http://24.media.tumblr.com/59c3c4f0ca1a291a2a9c635eb65139ba/tumblr_mhprycuoi11rmd89qo8_r1_250.jpg) was chatting with a recorder player. Man. If you can listen to Maelstrom's story about getting into busking, please do. It's his to tell. I won't post it. I asked how I could busk here and what the rules were.

**3) The signup sheet is a small piece of paper stuck behind the [busking sign](http://25.media.tumblr.com/1f546e50b63b57084b46e8f9a50c61ce/tumblr_mhprycuoi11rmd89qo1_500.jpg). It's placed there by the first busker to arrive. It starts as a blank schedule with the date and station at the top. If you want to play at a spot, sign up on the schedule.**

**4)When you sign up, you write your name in the time slot you want. You can pick one time slot a day at each station. But when you do that, it's yours. Anybody who comes up to hassle you while you're playing, you tell them ""I'm signed up. It's my spot.""**

**5) The schedules are filled up soon in busy stations, because the buskers arrive early like 5:30 am to get their spot. Buskers work hard. Woo! In slow stations, like say Cremazie, there may be no buskers all day (sad) and thus no piece of paper. You can just play.**

**6) In busy stations there will be a main piece of paper and also a backup, and maybe another backup. The backups are stuck behind billboards. Look around, and make sure you sign up on all of them. This helps in case of dispute, or stolen schedules.**

**7) The spots labelled Les Etoiles Du Metro are held for members of the MMM who have passed an audition.**

Maelstrom and the recorderist told me all this. And then Maelstrom talked for 20 minutes straight about busking and the MMM. 

*If you ask buskers (especially him) about the MMM, you will hear a lot. As an excellent story, it has many good [versions](http://montrealbuskers.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/what-is-the-busker-metro-system/). What I will say is that Montreal has the best busking rules system I have heard of everywhere, it is a thing to be proud of, and I don't truly know how it came to be. I am thrilled that I don't have to fight, argue or scare people in order to busk. But there are buskers who say that a lack of regulation made for a more diverse metro music scene, and the rules scare away good musicians who don't know how they work. To that I say, lazy kids.*

The schedule was full that day. I left Sherbrooke on the orange line to Cote Vertu, Bach [echoing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRh7htfDBGU) in the corridor behind me.

I thought. St-Laurent was a busy street, I reasoned. Maybe there was room on the schedule at that station. I showed up there, accordion in hand, and found no schedule. Surprised, I opened my case and [began](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-BwV0DDUY) to play. 

*which station should you play at? If you want to make money easily, go play at the busy stations. If you want to make money and not travel, play harder at the station closest to you. If you want to make money in a place you love, play harder at your favourite Metro station. For a while mine was St-Laurent. Then Cremazie. Then Square-Victoria.*

My friends asked me how busking was going. I'd say ""It is the only job where you get paid more, the more fun you have"" and then ""I'm going to learn the entire Amelie soundtrack.""

Strangers would ask what I was doing in Montreal. Boldly: ""Playing accordion in the Metro."" Some people would be amazed. Many people curious. I always expected some people to be scornful. Nobody ever appeared to be. 

As time went on, I learnt which busking stations I loved most, and the finer rules.

One day I arrived at dependable Sherbrooke and found the spot empty, half an hour past the starting time. I set up and played [till](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrjrnebYRj8) Maelstrom came by and inspected the schedule. 

""OK,"" he said after the song. ""OK, I am going to be the hard guy and go by the rulebook on this, and take this spot from you. The rules say that if you are taking an absent spot after 30 minutes, you must write your name in place of the absentee's."" He looked me in the eye to make sure I understood, and wrote his name down. I nodded and started to pack up. 

He said, quite simply, ""I am only doing this so you'll remember, and also because I want this spot to make some money because I got up late this morning. But listen, come back in half an hour and I'll give it back to you, because I can see that you are very respectful."" He sat down and started to play. My admiration of him increased. I walked off to visit Square-Vic. 

*Respect between buskers takes this form for me: Go by the rules, and wait till they've finished the song.*

**THE JOY**

God. I cannot tell you, without hugging you, how happy it makes me to connect with so many strangers so quickly. Think about how you feel when someone is playing a song you love well. Imagine being that person, seeing that someone loves your music. Imagine playing those [songs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmCnQDUSO4I) for 4-6 hours a day. That's what busking can be like.

And what can it busking be like in less positive times? 

A chore. You should love it, but all you can do is push your fingers to make sounds. BORING. And you've signed up for 4-6 hours today. Get through it. What song is next? Boring. When I'm not into it, that's also what busking can be like. 

Thankfully most of my days tended towards the positive. How?

*A busker from the Petrovjic Blasting Company once gave me advice that I use frequently while busking. He said ""Playing with great technical skill is fun for you. But it won't make you more money. Playing with heart will make you more money.""*

*If you can't play with heart, then flake, let the spot go, and go drink vodka and write in your journal till you pick up that instrument by choice and the sounds just sing themselves out.*

But what made me leave busking?

It was a long string of gray days, towards the end. I said no. This is not where I want to be, underground, making love to a song I don't adore. I packed up my accordion and went home. 

What lesson can you take from that, dear reader? *That busking 4 hours a day is like moving in with your girlfriend. It will test your relationship with your music.* Me, I needed a break. I bake bagels now, and I'm very happy. But if I returned to it, and wanted to be a happy busker, I would say this.

*Pay attention to your enjoyment. Do things that renew your love with your music. Play only your favourite songs. Play songs that challenge you. Play only new songs. Get a sweet prop like the boat guy. Do any of these things if they will keep your heart in it.*

*I told the truth. Busking is the only job I know where the more you have fun, the more money you make. Bagels don't mind if you're daydreaming about dinosaurs as you make them. But when busking, put your heart into every note and people will stop to listen.*


**MONEY**

An always interesting question. How much money do I make?

Well, to that I say: How much is in your pocket right now? 

You'd probably say it depends. Well, busking wages depend on the amount of people, and on feelings, and how much money is in their pockets right now. 

If that sounds exciting, you should go busk right now, cause it is. You will never know how much you'll make in an hour. I hear buskers quote a lot of numbers, but I don't ever compare. Consider. Somebody is passing by on their hurried way, and there's music playing. Maybe there is a feeling in the air that makes them slow down, and maybe they smile, or suddenly tear up, or feel love, and maybe they express their thanks by giving you a dollar. How fragile is that? 

Though I should mention that there are the regulars- sweet old ladies and harried businessmen who will give you money just for being there. I view this as my base wage, but I feel impersonal cause they are clearly not really listening. When someone gives me a dollar or nothing and says that they loved hearing that song, my heart melts and I can keep playing.

In closing, I will soon be posting an AMA. This was a long short story. If you read it, that means something to me. Thank you.

**TL;DR: Read the wiki. Musicians: If you want to try, go sign up in the morning, it's easy and happy. Others: You can always feel good about stopping to listen to a good song.** ",,False,,t5_2qnmr,1360825810.0,,,True,t3_18i2og,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/18i2og/busking_in_montreal_a_learning_story/,

Last night my younger brother was out at Reggies. He didn't come home, and wound up calling my mother from the hospital. He was reluctant to give the whole story and all we knew at first was that he had been stabbed in the leg. 

My father sussed out the story as best he could, and so far what we have is that my brother was at Reggie's alone, but had been dancing with people. At some point he started acting strange and was kicked out. Nobody knows what happened after that, but somebody found him outside bleeding. Somebody performed first aid while the paramedics were called. 

To the person who performed first aid, thank you! We don't know how bad the injury was, but considering they did surgery, you may very well have saved his life. My dad will probably contact you himself, as he is determined to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. Hopefully, my brother will tell us himself, but we can't help being curious.

But again, to those of you who helped a stranger on a drunken, post-reggie's night, thank you. Thank you so much!

Background: a number of people have been asking me where I got this figure from, with some alleging that I had yanked it out of my ass.  Admittedly, I was mistaken when I had alleged the percentage was this high amongst the working population, but I knew I had read a credible study when preparing a university paper many moons ago that backed up my assertion. 

Of note, this study was commissioned in 2001, and found that 90% of the 18-24 age demographic of Anglo-Québécois were able to hold a conversation in French. That was eleven years ago and the trend has increased steadily ever since among that and lower-aged cohorts. The student population of 2001 is in their early thirties today, and are now part of the workforce. They're having kids and raising them bilingually too.

The general Anglo population level of bilingualism right now is 70%, but Anglo in this case refers to people who have English as a mother-tongue, 607,000 people in Québec as of 2006: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-642-x/89-642-x2010002-eng.pdf (chart on page 11) or 8.2% of the population. 

The Anglo-Québécois population was highest in 1971 at 788,000 people (13.2%) and declined straight until 2001, and has since increased by roughly 20,000 people.

Of note - the percentage of children under the age of 18 with one parent from each language group has increased to 44% in 2006 from 27% in 1971 http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-642-x/89-642-x2010002-eng.pdf (page 22)

TL;DR: 

- Bilingualism among Québec Anglophones is on the rise: http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-555/p13-eng.cfm
- Amongst Anglo-Québécois children and youth, it was 90% eleven years ago, so we can presume it's nearly the same for twenty and thirty-somethings today as well.
- Unilingual Anglophones are increasingly of retirement age.
- Bill 101 has been in effect since 1977 and has made French a fundamental necessity for life in Québec, not to mention gaining decent employment in this province

So what does this mean?

I think it says that whatever the Anglo Québécois community was thirty years ago, it has fundamentally changed and we're better for it today. I think it also means that bilingualism in English and French is something anyone can accomplish and it is something our community is well on its way to accomplishing just this. 

And we're doing so by integrating. And would you believe neither our culture nor our language has disappeared?

Amazing isn't it?

So why do we take politicians seriously when they allege the English-language is a pervasive disorder threatening the sanctity of the French fact in Québec?

Why is it alleged that we can't speak French, that we force others to speak English, and that we simply refuse to integrate when precisely the opposite has been the case for over forty years?

It's starting to get a little ridiculous...non?

I've been in Montréal for 2 years now, and tonight, for the first time, a stranger tired to follow me home. It's daylight, the metro is busy, my arms are full or grocery bags and this guy is high out his mind. I was terrified but a kind young woman escorted me home.

This man was in his early 20'S, short (about 5ft) muscular build, spoke french, very pale kind and short-almost bald- hair. He was smoking near the platform at snowdon, stared me down, asked me for change and I politely declined. I moved away and he followed, then moved to another cart right when the doors were closing, and did my best to avoid him when he followed me again. The whole ride he stared at me, things were very uncomfortable. I got off at my stop, once again at the last minute and he ran out right before the doors closed. 

As I went up the stairs, someone grabbed my arm and it turned out to be another young woman who told me she had seen what he was doing and offered to walk me home. We walked as fast as we could and took a confusing route. I'm safely home now thanks to her :)

All to say, ladies, please be careful! As for the general population, male or female, if you see someone in an uncomfortable situation with a stranger, please intervene! That person may be in need of help and your assistance could  avoid a nasty situation.

Je suis francophone donc si vous voulez la traduction cette histoire, n'hésitez pas de me le demander.

EDIT:

Bonjour /r/Montréal,

Voilà 2 ans depuis que j'habite cette ville. Ce soir, pour la première fois, un étranger a essayé de me suivre lors de ma rentrée à la maison. Il fesait jour, le métro était bien occupé, j'avais les bras plein de sacs d'épicerie et cet homme était gelé. J'ai eu la chienne de ma vie, mais une
 jeune dame m'a accompagnée jusqu'à mon apart.

Cet homme avait environ 20 ans, de petite taille mais musclé, m'a addressé en Français. Il avait le teint très clair et la tête presque chauve. Il fumait  près des rails à la station Snowdon. Il m'a regarder quelque temps, m'a demandé de la monnaie et je lui ai refusé. Je me suis distancée, il a suivit, pour ensuite me diriger vers un autre wagon, le métro arrivé. Il m'a suivit encore, pour ensuite s'asseoir à mes côtés et me regarder incomfortablement tout le long du trajet.

J'ai sorti du train à mon arrêt, à la dernière minute; il a courru pendant que les portes fermaient. Lorsque je montait les escalier, une jeune dame, qui avait vu l'incident, m'a pris par le bras et a offert de m'accompagner à la maison. Je suis sain et sauf grâce à elle :)

Tout pour dire, mesdames, soyez prudentes s.vp.! Pour ce qui s'agit de la population, homme et femme, si vous voyez quelqu'un pris dans un situation incomfortable par un étranger, svp agissez! Cet person a peut-être besoin d'assistance et votre aide pourra peut-être éviter un incident.",,False,,t5_2qnmr,1367414258.0,,,True,t3_1cz45f,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1cz45f/metro_creeper_tried_to_follow_me_home/,

These are the kinds of things you think of once you're safe and sound at home, not in the shock and in harm's way.

I'm writing to warn you guys (girls) and also maybe find out if anyone's heard of this guy before. Here is a description:

1- Drives a VAN, grey I think

2- In his 50's

3- Dark curly hair, glasses, light brown (arabic descent) skin

He told me he could see I was going to have a bright future by ""something in my eye"". Was very friendly and talkative. Asked about my life, what I did, etc. Also asked who I lived with (no I know why...)

He kept talking about that ""thing in my eye"" and said that he's a palm reader and would read my palm after. I thought the whole thing was hilarious so I agreed. He stopped the meter, came and sat in the back, and said he needed to look at my shoulders as part of the palm reading.

Before I knew it he had his hands in my bra...fully... and exposing me. Again, no i did not push him off immediately or scream or anything, it's really scary to be trapped inside a car like that. I pushed my bra down and said I didnt want to, payed up, and requested my baggage. Very grateful nothing else happened. 

Please warn your girlfriends, friends, family, whatever. Watch out for Van cab drivers of this description. I don't know the cab company unfortunately... 

EDIT: Thanks to Bones123 and other Redditors' advice I called the cops and filed a police report. They just left. Important details they made me remember by asking me questions, which may be helpful if you find yourself taking a van cab: messy trunk, old van model, sliding doors, guy called himself ""Joseph"".

As I approach Joliette metro I hear someone say the bus driver was hit in the face by a passenger. I saw a guy suspiciously walking away fast and looking often at the bus. As this was on my way I followed him from afar. He turned onto a small street and immediately turned into a dark lane. 

I said to myself I'm wasting my time since it's going to take too long for the cops to show up. I turn around and 2 cop cars arrived at the bus fast. I got onto hochelaga street and waved at them like an idiot. 

Surprisingly, they rushed full speed in their cars straight towards me. I pointed to the lane but these idiots were going too fast. I screamed STOP. They tailgated my ass until I pointed to the suspect at the far end of the lane. They almost crashed into each other; keystone-cops moment. 

The suspect disappeared over a fence into somebody's dark yard. The cop jumped the fence. He was trying to hide on the 2nd floor balcony. 

Anyways, it took 5 cops to handcuff him. He was screaming like a little kid. 

If you do a crime don't be a pussy when they put handcuffs on you. They had to tie his body and feet to the seat of the car; what a pussy. 

I continued my fast walk to Peel. A typical night for me when I walk; including a small young psychiatric woman screaming about my shorts !? I don't count anymore the drunks in my way.

Here is a little guide for all the people that don't know what it is, and some tips after years of experience.

**What is Igloofest**

Igloofest is a month long outdoors electronic festival. It takes place at the [Quais Jaques-Cartier](http://s3.amazonaws.com/igloofest/images/carte.png?1353426826). It is now 18+. 

**When is Igloofest**

Igloofest takes place every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, from Mid January to Mid February. 

Dates include Thu 17 / Fri 18 / Sat 19 - Thu 24 / Fri 25 / Sat 26 - Thu 31 / Fri 1 / Sat 2 - Thu 7 / Fri 8 / 9

**What kind of music does it play**

[Electronic music](http://igloofest.ca/en/events/2013/02#d17)

**How much does it cost**

Online - 18.50$

Gates - 20$

Boutique - 16$

A boutique that sells them is called [Off the Hook](https://maps.google.ca/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=off+the+hook+montreal&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=off+the+hook+montreal&amp;hnear=off+the+hook+montreal&amp;cid=0,0,1856398794412066808&amp;ei=OTDvUPSqE6i30AHzvYCYAw&amp;ved=0CKIBEPwSMAA). Just go up the stairs and to the cashier and buy tickets. 

PRO TIP - Do **NOT** show up on Saturday expecting to find a ticket after 8PM, especially in the last 2 weekends. They have sold out several times. Scalpers will really drive up the price. When you buy tickets in advance, they are sold FOR THAT DATE ONLY, and cannot be used on another date. Alternatively, you can buy a 40$ Week pass, or a 120$ Season pass. 

**How to get there**

If you will be drinking, your best bet is to take the metro. Don't forget that you can buy an evening pass for 5.50$, valid until 3 AM. This gives you unlimited metro / bus rides.

If you will be driving, a good place to park is on [Rue Notre Dame Est](https://maps.google.ca/maps?saddr=Rue+de+la+Commune+E&amp;daddr=Rue+Notre-Dame+E&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=45.513444,-73.550377&amp;sspn1. =0.023817,0.038581&amp;geocode=FRBitgId0a6d-w%3BFT19tgIdv7Wd-w&amp;gl=ca&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=16) (the bridge). 

**How long does it last**

It generally starts around 6-7PM, and lasts till 12:30 / 1 AM. It can't go on longer because of noise violations. Fun (and line ups) start around 8-9. If you leave, you can't come back in. I think it closes after 10PM (no more entry?).

**Pro Tips**

1. Wear Snow pants. I don't care how lame you think it makes you look, but the difference between an awesome Igloofest and an OK one is how cold you are. The crowd itself is not too cold, but walking around can get really cold.

2. Wear 2 pairs of socks, your feet will quickly freeze.

3. BYOB. Alcohol is sold there, but it is club prices (highway robbery). Your best bet is to sneak in a mickey (underneath your snowpants). I think they are clamping down on weed smokers, so it isn't drug friendly. Igloofest is becoming more and more strict as more people are attending. 

4. Buy your ticket in advance

5. Have an exit strategy. Igloofest finishes RIGHT before the metro closes. If you plan on sticking around, make sure you know how you are getting home

6. Take a photo at the booth!

**HAVE FUN, IGLOOFEST IS AWESOME AND SHOULD NOT BE MISSED**

edit: bringing your own alcohol is illegal

edit2: There are two stages, the main one which is outdoors, and a second one which is indoors. The indoors one is obviously a lot warmer.

Also, there are places to sit in mini igloos, and little fires to keep warm (and marshmellows). 

There is an interior which they use to sell merchandise (clothes / hats), food and take your pictures. There are LOTS of portopotties outside. ",,False,,t5_2qnmr,1357883904.0,,,True,t3_16c6cq,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/16c6cq/how_to_igloofest_like_a_pro/,

Some commenter at the Montreal City Weblog (mare) used some stitching software to combine the photos in the downtown and plateau areas. I then put them on a google satellite map.

www.cat-bus.com/2013/03/then-and-now-again1947-aerial-photography-vs-google-satellite
(this is on my bog, a full screen version is linked from there)

Here's how I made this: I found a couple of points on the old map (a ~30K x 30K image) that I could find on a new google satellite view. I then recorded, for these anchor points, the lat,lng values, and the pixel coordinates in the stitched imagery (for like 8 anchor points). Using a little projection library (mercator.py) I found the exact tile coordinates of the lat,lng coordinates. So Now I have to create a set of tiles where the imagery is transformed to fit those tile coordinates. I used a linear transformation. To find that, I used a least squares solver (via numpy), because only three anchor points define a linear transformation, but I had 8. Using an over-determined system means that errors in the anchor points will smooth out a little - plus other errors, due to the stitching, the projections involved, the lens warpings in the original image, and the fact that the imagery wasn't taken from high above (even for individual photos, you can see facades facing different directions).

Once I had a linear transfomation, I applied that to the image using imagemagick (i.e. apply affine transformation), added offsets to align the tiles, and tiled the images. This can all be done in one command, and it gave me about 30K tiles at googles zoom level 19. They were then combined, four at a time into a new tile, to create the lower zoom levels. Finally I just threw that on my server, and put a little google maps page to look at them, and to allow users to switch back and forth.",,False,,t5_2qnmr,False,,,True,t3_1a883y,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1a883y/i_combined_some_1947_aerial_photos_with_google/,

Just had a guy ring my bell and pitch me a rather convincing story about how his ""Direct Energy"" company was in the area replacing ALL the hot water tanks (water heaters) and he wanted to see what the condition of the tank was. If they determined I was eligible for a replacement, I'd get a high efficiency, stainless steel tank installed. The way he pitched it seemed as if he was from the city/contact company, so unsuspecting people (or renters) might fall prey to this type of scam.

(Typically they'll then charge thousands to replace your tank for one that you don't need, they've hit Toronto in 2011 and I guess they've made it to Montreal). The guy who was at my door was a blue eyed, late 20's male who spoke french with a thick European/Russian accent. I live in St. Laurent but they might be headed around the area. So heads up, don't engage them, DON'T SIGN ANYTHING, AND DON'T EVER LET THEM IN.

Obviously I knew it was some sort of scam (I changed my own tank literally last week), but I'm sure other people may not know that hot water tanks / water heaters are owned by you and not a private company / city responsibility. (In the cases that you DO rent from a company, they'll call and send a letter, but never a door-salesman) So heads up, Montreal. It's going to be a hell of a summer.

I went hiking the other day. Saturday. I was going to hike downtown.

I decided to take the bike path.

I thought it went to Old Montreal.

When I got to the Champlain Bridge, I noticed a path that leads under it.

I decided to take it, thinking it ran along the water line.

When I went under the bridge, It was very spooky.

Lots of really cool graffiti and not so cool art.

When I reached the other side, it opened into this nice, wooded area.

There were lots of paths heading in every direction.

[Name] and I decided to follow one.

All of a sudden, I see this guy in the bushes.

He took one look at me and ran, fast. Then disappeared on another trail.

I thought, well that's weird. But I kept walking anyway.

About 10 yards from that spot, I heard a noise and voices.

I stopped to look around and saw,

well, I saw,

2 men.

having sex.

So, needless to say, I just kept walking.

Nothing wrong there.

Just 2 people in love..

As I got about another 20 yards down trail,

There was another man.

Standing there,

With a cigarette hanging out of his mouth,

BUTT NAKED.

Then all of a sudden,

There were naked men, EVERYWHERE!

Men having sex, men watching in the bushes..

Very WEIRD.

It was like I was transported to another world when I went under that bridge!

As I kept walking, much faster this time, and got to the other side of the woods, I was trapped!

I couldn't go anywhere.

It was a highway!

So I cut down another trail, heading towards the river.

This trail went through grass that was about 7-8' high, so I couldn't see anything.

Then, all of a sudden, Again! Naked old guys!

When I got to the river, DAMN! No path!

I decided to head back towards the bridge on a different path.

There were guys walking around, hiding in the bushes, staring at me.

I yelled out that I was NEVER taking this path again.

Almost immediately, The men realized I came there my mistake.

And for the last hundred yards,

I did not see anyone.

Everywhere I turned there was a naked old man, standing there holding his pecker.

Not moving, or saying anything.

Just standing there, like a zombie.

Or there was a couple, having sex.

Not paying attention to anything around them.

When I finally made it back under the bridge,

I looked for signs in the graffiti.

Maybe there was some symbol or sign I missed.

Needless to say, I classify it as another portal.

A portal that takes you to a place that is way beyond my understanding.

I should have taken the empty crack bags, and hypodermic needles littering the area as a sign that I was about 
to go somewhere I did not belong.

But my adventurous spirit told me to go through.

Needless to say, he's never going under that bridge again.

1338471010.0,82,self.montreal,udtn8,A few friendly reminders from your moderation team,jkb83,146,64,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/udtn8/a_few_friendly_reminders_from_your_moderation_team/,"Il est évident que le discours sur r/Montréal est de plus en plus irrité à la suite des grèves étudiantes, la loi 78, les casseroles, et ainsi de suite. Cela est tout à fait compréhensible puisque qu'il reflète un climat politique tendu dans cette ville et cette province.

Toutefois, cela ne justifie en rien que nous devrions perdre notre capacité collective à être courtois et à faire preuve de compréhension autant que possible envers autrui. Je sais qu'aucun de nous est parfait, et il est particulièrement facile de perdre contact avec la réalité quand nous sommes anonymes sur Internet, mais je pense qu'il est possible d'améliorer la façon dont nous nous traitons les uns les autres lorsque nous discutons de ces sujets.

Tout le monde gagnerait à ce qui suit:

* Ne pas recourir à des injures et des insultes lorsque vous êtes en désaccord avec quelqu'un
* Ne pas ""downvoter"" tous les articles/commentaires avec lesquels vous êtes en désaccord: le bouton downvote ne doit être utilisé que pour les commentaires et articles qui ne contribuent rien d'intelligent ou d'utile à la conversation (comme ci-dessus
* Essayez d'éviter d'éttiqueter les individus en les associant à un groupe étroitement défini bourré de préjugés comme par exemple ""tous les manifestants sont des étudiants paresseux"", ""toutes les personnes contre la grève sont des porcs rhodésiens capitalistes"". Il est temps de vivre dans un réel qui est principalement nuancé de gris.
* NE PAS NOURRIR LES TROLLS. Sérieux. Vous savez qui ils sont et vous savez que les nourrir ne fait que vous frustrer et leur donne de l'importance. Ils sont à plaindre.
* Utilisez le bouton ""rapporter"" (report) pour signaler des articles et commentaires qui ne respectent pas tout ce qui est évoqué ci-dessus. Ne vous plaignez pas à nous au sujet de gens qui font ce genre de commentaires sans le signaler: Nous ne pouvons pas modérer chaque fil dans chaque article, essayer un peu de nous aider. Rapporter nous facilite vraiment la tâche.
* Enfin, réfléchissez avant de poster. Proférez-vous des injures? Prenez une grande inspiration et détendez-vous. Etes-vous biaisés? Etes-vous fidèles à vous même? Downvotez-vous parce que vous êtes en désaccord avec un commentaire pourtant réfléchi?

Même si une poignée de membres commencent à marteler ce genre de rappels, on remarquera une amélioration drastique dans le fond et la forme de ce subreddit.

______
Quelques rappels généraux supplémentaires:

* Aucun lien raccourci ne sera autorisé
* Maintenez les articles [FIXED] (réparé) au sein de la section des commentaires de l'article original, sinon il sera supprimé
* Minimisez les memes

___________

It is apparent that the discourse in r/Montreal has become increasingly heated following the student strikes, Bill 78, the casseroles, and so forth. It is completely understandable, as it reflects a heated political climate in this city and this province.

However, this does not mean that we should lose our collective ability to be civil and as understanding as possible towards each other. I know none of us are perfect human beings, and it is especially easy to lose sight of reality when we are anonymous typists on the internet, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement in how we treat each other when we are discussing these topics.

Everyone would benefit from the following:

* Do not resort to name-calling and insults when you disagree with someone 
* Do not downvote all posts/comments that you disagree with: the downvote button should only be used for those comments/posts that do not contribute anything intelligent/useful to the conversation (such as above)
* Try to avoid grouping all individuals into one narrowly defined and prejudiced/biased group: i.e all protesters are lazy students, all people against the strikes are capitalist rhodesien pigs. It is time to live in reality that exists primarily in shades of grey
* **DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS**. Seriously. You know who they are and you know feeding them only frustrates you and makes them feel somehow more important. They are to be pitied. 
* Use the **REPORT BUTTON** to report posts/comments that violate anything that is mentioned above. Don't complain to us about people making those kinds of comments without reporting it: we can't moderate every single comment thread in every single post, try to help us out a little. Reporting makes things much easier on us.
* Finally, **THINK BEFORE YOU POST**. Are you name-calling? Take a breath and relax. Are you being prejudiced? Can you recognize this in yourself? Are you downvoting because you disagree with a well-thought out post? 

Even if a few more vocal members of this community begin to apply these reminders, we will all notice a drastic improvement in the quality and content of this subreddit.

Please circulate in your networks as you see fit.
 
&gt; You may have heard that there has been some turmoil in Quebec in recent weeks. There have been demonstrations in the streets of Montreal every night for almost a month now, and a massive demonstration will be happening tomorrow, which I will be attending, along with my wife, Elizabeth Elbourne, and my eldest daughter Emma.
 
&gt; Reading the Anglo-Canadian press, it strikes me that you have been getting a very fragmented and biased picture of what is going on. Given the gulf that has already emerged between Quebec and the rest of Canada in the wake of the 2011 election, it is important that the issues under discussion here at least be represented clearly. You may decide at the end of the day that we are crazy, but at least you should reach that decision on the basis of the facts, rather than of the distortions that have been served up by the G&amp;M and other outlets.
 
&gt; First, the matter of the tuition hikes, which touched off this mess. The rest of the country seems to have reached the conclusion that the students are spoiled, selfish brats, who would still be paying the lowest tuition fees even if the whole of the proposed increase went through.
 
&gt; The first thing to say is that this is an odd conception of selfishness. Students have been sticking with the strikes even knowing that they may suffer deleterious consequences, both financial and academic. They have been marching every night despite the threat of beatings, tear-gas, rubber bullets, and arrests. It is, of course, easier for the right-wing media to dismiss them if they can be portrayed as selfish kids to whom no -one has ever said ""no"". But there is clearly an issue of principle here.
 
&gt; OK, then. But maybe the principle is the wrong one. Free tuition may just be a pie-in-the sky idea that mature people give up on when they put away childish things. And besides, why should other people pay for the students' ""free"" tuition? There is no such thing as ""free"" education. Someone, somewhere, has to pay. And the students, the criticism continues, are simply refusing to pay their ""fair share"".
 
&gt; Why is that criticism simplistic? Because the students' claim has never been that they should not pay for education. The question is whether they should do so up front, before they have income, or later, as taxpayers in a progressive taxation scheme. Another question has to do with the degree to which Universities should be funded by everyone, or primarily by those who attend them. So the issue of how to fund Universities justly is complicated. We have to figure out at what point in people's lives they should be paying for their education, and we also have to figure out how much of the bill should be footed by those who do not attend, but who benefit from a University-educated work force of doctors, lawyers, etc. The students' answer to this question may not be the best, but then it does not strike me that the government's is all that thought out either.
 
&gt; And at least the students have been trying to make ARGUMENTS and to engage the government and the rest of society in debate, whereas the government's attitude, other than to invoke the in-this-context-meaningless ""everyone pays their faire share"" argument like a mantra, has been to say ""Shut up, and obey"".
 
&gt; What strikes the balance in the students' favour in the Quebec context is that the ideal of no up-front financial hurdles to University access is enshrined in some of the most foundational documents of Quebec's Quiet Revolution, in particular the Parent Commission Report, which wrested control of schools from the Church and created the modern Quebec education system, a cornerstone of the kind of society that many Quebeckers see themselves as aspiring to. Now, it could be that that ideal is no longer viable, or that we may no longer want to subscribe to it. But moving away from it, as Charest's measures have done, at least requires a debate, analogous to the debate that would have to be had if the Feds proposed to scrap the Canada Health Act. It is clearly not just an administrative measure. It is political through and through. Indeed it strikes at fundamental questions about the kind of society we want to live in. If this isn't the sort of thing that requires democratic debate, I don't know what is.
 
&gt; The government has met the very reasonable request that this issue, and broader issues of University governance, be at least addressed in some suitably open and democratic manner with silence, then derision, then injunctions, and now, with the most odious ""law"" that I have seen voted by the Quebec National Assembly in my adult memory. It places the right of all Quebec citizens to assemble, but also to talk and discuss about these issues, under severe limitations. It includes that most odious of categories: crimes of omission, as in, you can get fined for omitting to attempt to prevent someone from taking part in an act judged illegal by the law. In principle, the simple wearing of the by-now iconic red square can be subject to a fine. The government has also made the student leaders absurdly and ruinously responsible for any action that is ostensibly carried out under the banners of their organizations. The students groups can be fined $125000 whenever someone claiming to be ""part"" of the movement throws a rock through a window. And so on. It is truly a thing to behold.
 
&gt; The government is clearly aware that this ""law"" would not withstand a millisecond of Charter scrutiny. It actually expires in July 2013, well before challenges could actually wind their way through the Courts. The intention is thus clearly just to bring down the hammer on this particular movement by using methods that the government knows to be contrary to basic liberal-democratic rule-of-law principles. The cynicism is jaw-dropping. It is beneath contempt for the government to play fast and loose with our civil rights and liberties in order to deal with the results of its own abject failure to govern.
 
&gt; So that is why tomorrow I will be taking a walk in downtown Montreal with (hopefully!) hundreds of thousands of my fellow citizens. Again, you are all free to disagree, but at least don't let it be because of the completely distorted picture of what is going on here that you have been getting from media outlets, including some from which we might have expected more.

The A one is mostly for domestic and B for international flights. Both departure halls are connected so if 1 gate is crazy busy you can try to go through the other gate. You only have to ask the security guard to see if the door linking both places is open.


-Right by the B departure gate in the main departure hall there are stairs going up to a quieter hall with better chairs and a small playground for kids. Not a lot of people know about it so it's a nice place to chill if you don't have access to the lounges.


-At the arrival floor (1 floor down from the departures) there is a Subway and a Tim Horton. Both are cheaper than the food offered in the main departure hall. 


-Cabs in and out of the airport have a flat rate of 40$ from downtown Montreal. But the best way to travel is by bus. The Montreal transit system (STM) has an express shuttle called the 747 that links the airport to the city. The bus will not accept normal tickets, you'll need a 1 day pass that you can purchase directly in the bus for  8$ (requires exact change) or at any metro station, pharmacies or at the airport (monthly passes work too). The 747 bus is equipped with free WiFi!

I yelled, ""Hey! What's wrong with you?!"" in my shock and destabilized state. He only turned to look at me with a sneer that indicated that I was somehow the wrong-doer in his mind. The SPVM were wonderful and took all my information. They informed me there was a similar individual hitting/punching women cyclists in Park Lafontaine not long ago. It is my opinion that the man I encountered this morning is battling his own demons and likely suffers from a severe psychological disorder, and he likely saw me as a threat. I had sensed this man was ""off"" but chose to suppress this feeling because I have never been assaulted and thought my initial reaction was paranoid or over-the-top.

I thought all was well until suddenly, I drove the car downtown and the engine started overheating! Something is horribly wrong with the vehicle, and we don't know anyone in town. We're stranded at a McDonald's in Greenfield Park. And of course we don't speak french... 

I've seen generosity on reddit before, and I'm wondering if anyone in the area: 

a) Knows a mechanic who is reputable, fair, english-capable, and small. 
b) Would be willing to help a few Americans with a place to stay for the night. 

I really loved your city, we were here to see Leonard Cohen in his home town. I'd love to move here some day... maybe this will be a way to make friends for the future? 

I will be monitoring reddit for another 30-40 minutes before we need to get out of this McDonald's and try to find shelter. Please send me a personal message if you can help in any way... 

Thank you for any help you can give. 

Sincerely, 
- Americans trapped in hamburger hell

**UPDATE (FRI MORN)**: We got towed with my insurance, and the friendly tow man brought us to a place that speaks english well. They got our car in right away and are looking at it now.
We are eating at the wonderfully ""foreign"" Jack Astor's across the street awaiting our fate. We may still be in need of a place to stay (if anyone is willing) for the night if the car breaks down. We are semi-known independent filmmakers from America, if it gets to that you can always look us up to be sure we're not criminals...

**UPDATE 2 (FRI AFTERNOON)**:  Ok. So our friendly mechanics in Greenfield Park are working overtime to get us out of here, unfortunately though, our car's head gasket is blown, so it's not an easy fix. They are putting in extra hours to get us out tomorrow.

We are running out of money fast (fix cost $1100), and still need to get back to the states. Any place to crash would be amazing.

**WE DO HAVE A LOANER CAR NOW**. The mechanics gave us a loaner to get around. So we are back on the island downtown but can get anywhere. If someone in a cool hipster/artist neighborhood wants to give a shout, please do! We've only really seen the touristy spots.

1346080231.0,71,self.montreal,ywmqd,BarCraft Montreal August 26th- Feedback from a disapointed attendee,Patrosz,86,15,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/ywmqd/barcraft_montreal_august_26th_feedback_from_a/,"Hey /r/montreal.

Just wanted to share with you guys my experience at BarCraft Montreal yesterday. My friends and I had a pretty disappointing experience and I'd like to share with you what happened to that the organizers can learn from it for any future events they plan and get some feedback from anyone else who has attended

Problem #1: Lack of seating. We had paid for the $30 'VIP' ticket. Problems started right as we arrived as we found out that there were no more seats left in the VIP section (note: we arrived within the first hour of the event and most of the 'regular' section was empty). Sure you could say ""well you should have gone earlier to secure a seat"" to which I will disagree. The VIP section has limited number of tickets and the organizers should not have sold more tickets than there were seats. Needless to say we sat in the 'regular section' for a majority of the event. Fine we said, at least the screens here are VISIBLE!

Problem #2: Not enough TVs in VIP. In the 'VIP' section, in which we did spend some time, mostly standing up, there were only 2 small TVs, around 46-50 inch each. Problem is the seating is not configured to allow everyone to see. So at the very end of the night, we were able to get someone else's seat for the finals, we could barely see the TVs as the angles were bad. Next time, an extra TV or two would go a long way in ensuring that everyone can at least see the action.

Problem #3: False advertising. The ticket clearly says ""30$ + 1 drink"". 1 drink to me (and i'm pretty sure the general population) means that I get a free DRINK. We assumed this would be a beer. You know, inexpensive but get you started at the bar. Nope. The free drink we were allowed to was a shot. Yes a shot of tequila... No mixers, nothing. It was just a promotion that Sauza was having and they were handed out to guests. Another smaller problem arose when the girls handing them out were told by management that they had given far too many out and had to stop. Some people got one shot... others got none as they didn't 'get there' fast enough. Once again, a reflection on the poor organization, which leads us to the next problem.

Problem #4: Free food. The 'VIP' ticket for which you pay extra for, said food would be offered. Well, there was food... pizza from dominos. Problem? Not enough for everyone. By the time we realized there was pizza being handed out, we didn't even make it to the front of the line to be told ""it's all gone"". Really? You KNOW how many tickets you sold. How could you not order enough pizza? Very disappointing, as we then to leave the premises to secure some dinner as the event was all day long, which lead us to yet ANOTHER problem.

Problem #5: Terrible customer service. So as I mentioned before we had to leave the premises to grab some food. We walked over a block and grabbed some 3 brasseurs and were back within the hour, right in time for the finals. Perfect right? Wrong. When we got back we were greeted by a short, dark skinned, grey haired man who claimed to be the manager and said we were NOT allowed back in. Why? Because we left and there was no re-entry. Not only was there never ANY indication of such a rule, but the entire concept seemed absurd. The door was right there, why couldn't we just walk in? He offered no good reason other than just hammering the fact that ""no re-entry is allowed"". We had clearly labeled bracelets that showed we had paid, there was no excuse to be treated this way. I argued with the man for 5-10 minutes on the subject, which felt like bashing my head against a wall. Finally, some other lady came to see what was going on.. he asked her what she thought of the matter. 1 and a half second later she gave us the 'OK' to go back in. I managed to run into the organizer and explained to him what had just happened. He didn't really seem to care or offer any apologies. He said that some of the rules had changed last night and that he would look into it better next time. Thank god we argued like we did with the manager as later we found out several other people had left to go eat and might have been denied re-entry.

Did I have fun overall? Sure. The matches were intense and the crowd was fun for the most part. Would I ever return to a BarCaraft Montreal under the current organization? Absolutely not. My friends and I are planning on hosting our own mini-event next time. Which is a shame because the concept of BarCraft is one that we all love.

Je ne parle pas de la panner d'hier le 2 avril, *mais bien d'une nouvelle panne*.

J'aimerais bien que ceci soit une mauvaise blague d'informaticiens, mais le système informatique de la STM qui a été récemment mis en place pour moderniser leurs installations est composé de *82 serveurs IBM sous Windows* ([source](http://www.stm.info/en-bref/Reno-Systemes%20et%20la%20commande%20centralisee110408.pdf)).

Et quand ça plante, on *reboot*, puis après un *patch*, en bon français. Je cite directement des employés et dirigeants de la STM ci-bas.

Quelques faits récents (texte en gras par mes soins):

* Le 2 avril 2012, nouvelle panne généralisée: ""C'est **le même problème que l'on a connu en mars et en juillet dernier**. C'est un problème de logiciel. Mais la bonne nouvelle, c'est qu'une mise à jour de ce logiciel nous a été livrée dernièrement, elle est testée en ce moment et elle sera implantée à la fin du mois."" ([Amélie Régis, porte-parole de la Société de transport de Montréal](http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/faitsdivers/archives/2013/04/20130402-180737.html)); ""Dans les premières années d'un nouveau système informatique, il y a des bugs, et ces bugs, **on est en train de trouver des rustines pour les réparer.**"" ([Michel Labrecque, président de la Société de transport de Montréal](http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/04/02/arret-de-service-complet-dans-le-metro-de-montreal_n_3002064.html));
* Le 22 mars 2013, ""Confrontée à une instabilité de son réseau informatique, et craignant une panne majeure, **la STM a volontairement redémarré son système pendant l'heure du midi**. «On voulait éviter qu'il y ait un problème majeur pendant l'heure de pointe, s'est justifiée Amélie Régis, porte-parole de la STM. Mais le redémarrage a été plus long que prévu.»"" ([source](http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/regional/montreal/archives/2013/03/20130313-122731.html))
* Le 9 décembre 2012, autre panne générale: ""Une porte-parole, Isabelle Tremblay, a confirmé que le problème était relié au système informatique, mais que la STM n’avait pas identifié sa source exacte."" ([source](http://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/204430/le-metro-de-montreal-brievement-paralyse/))
* Le 7 juillet 2012, "" Selon Isabelle Tremblay, porte-parole de la STM, un ordinateur a connu des problèmes qui se sont ensuite répercutés sur l'ensemble du système informatique. **Les ordinateurs ont donc dû tous être redémarrés** afin de rétablir le service sur les quatre lignes de métro. [...] L'enquête avait révélé qu'**un problème de télétransmission au niveau des données** était à l'origine de la panne [...] La porte-parole de la STM a insisté qu'«il n'y avait aucun lien entre les deux incidents. Ce sont deux problèmes qui sont complètement différents»"" ([source](http://fr.canoe.ca/infos/regional/archives/2012/07/20120707-103346.html))

Le 8 avril 2011 la Direction éxécutive - Gestion des projets majeurs de la STM présentait l'état des lieux de la modernisation technique du métro, incluant son système informatique. : [le document de la présentation est disponible sur le site de la STM](http://www.stm.info/en-bref/Reno-Systemes%20et%20la%20commande%20centralisee110408.pdf).

Quelques extraits de ce document: 

* ""Probabilité moyenne de défaillance sur une période de 10 ans de 1 sur 100,000,000""
* ""Après coup, on constate que la STM et le fournisseur n’étaient pas suffisamment préparés ni outillés pour faire face aux multiples enjeux technologiques que ce projet comportait.""
* ""Devant l’impossibilité de faire des démonstrations probantes de fonctionnement à l’été 2008, la direction du fournisseur s’est engagée à prendre les mesures nécessaires pour améliorer la bonne marche du projet, telles que l’ajout de ressources expertes.""
* ""Les essais des logiciels à l’été 2009 démontrèrent un nouvel échec.""
* ""Une analyse de différentes options a démontré qu’il était **plus coûteux pour la STM et risqué pour la problématique d’obsolescence des équipements existants d’annuler le contrat que de poursuivre le projet.**""
* ""Devant l’impasse technique et financière, les deux parties ont exploré différentes solutions. Une entente a alors été convenue en mars 2010.""
* ""À la suite d'une nouvelle entente et nouvelle stratégie, le budget du projet a été revu à la hausse. [...] **Initialement de 50,6 M$, il est maintenant de 196,8 M$.**""

Le nouveau système est en place depuis février 2012 ([source](http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/04/02/arret-de-service-complet-dans-le-metro-de-montreal_n_3002064.html)).

La firme Dessau a piloté le contrat de modernisation informatique et celui de modernisation télécom ([source](http://www.dessau.com/en/markets-sectors/telecommunications-and-security) / [album des captures d'écran sur imgur](http://imgur.com/a/NPeTj)). Pourquoi la STM utilise exclusivement Windows sur ses serveurs? Quelles autres options ont été considérées? Pourquoi le dépassements de coûts astronomiques pour un projet qui finallement n'a pas livré la marchandise? Je vous invite à compléter mes recherches.

Je viens de revenir du Pub du Faubourg, où j'étais allé regarder le match d'UFC de Georges St-Pierre.

Je me suis dit que je pourrais vous envoyer un avertissement par rapport au Pub du Faubourg (Ste-Catherine Est, proche de la rue Ste-Elizabeth). Mes amis sont arrivés avant moi pour prendre une table pour regarder le UFC, mais, lorsque je suis arrivé, le *boss* avait décidé de charger 20$ pour l'entrée. On a dû s'obstiner pendant plusieurs minutes avant que le patron n'accepte un compromis: 20$ pour l'entrée avec un petit pichet inclus.

Pour le reste de la soirée, nous avons dû nous chamailler avec le portier pour qu'il nous laisse rentrer lorsqu'on sortait. De plus, trois personnes ont commandé à manger parmi nous et les trois assiettes étaient froides lorsqu'elles sont arrivées.

Bref, je vous déconseille le Pub du Faubourg!

My French is aaight but it's French French and overly formal. But you all were tolerant of me talking slow and constantly screwing up. Mostly you guys just switched to English at the first sign of me struggling. 

Anyhow you guys were great and I had a great time. Only bummer part was that I came across what must have been a jumper from the KPMG building. Police had them covered up but it was a drag.

One question for you though. I heard a lot of conversations where people would speak French and English and switch back and forth for a sentence or two. It wasn't for covertness because I understood what they were talking about and it was nothing needing secrecy (besides, French and English aren't secret in Montreal). This happened in few of the conversations that I heard.

EDIT to add an actual question: ""Why do people switch back and forth like this?""

It's not uncommon at Cote Vertu metro. I was heading home from festival de la biere and it was 11:45pm I was at the bus stop. I was tired as hell. I work full time and had had a full day. I was exhausted and slightly tipsy from the late beer tasting after closing time. Anyway. This couple is talking to me and a 2nd guy (younger, around 18-20yo) just showed up hugged the man – the older man looked slightly wtf by that. The younger guy then started saying something to me and grabbed my phone and ran. I had it in my hand because I was looking at the time to double-check bus home. I ran after the guy but I was too late and he was gone. I ran around cote vertu several times but it was too late. I didn’t sleep at all. I had deactivated internet on my phone because I was running out of data so although I put iCloud phone wipe (which means all data will be erased from my phone), it won’t work until the phone is on the internet access. I called the police. They barely gave a shit. That’s a too common thing. I gave a description but honestly I barely got a glance. I was so shocked and it happened so fast I barely registered anything other then the black cap with silver round tag and that he was young and black, wearing dark clothes. A marvelously detailed description. Helpful, I know... 

I was really scared afterwards because I remembered there had been a group of 6-7 guys around just before the middle aged couple came to see me and I wondered if the younger guy had been with them. The group had almost fought around the time I stepped outside so I knew they were alerady jumpy. So if they had been with the thieves and if I had caught up with the thief, imagine if they’d been waiting for me. Holy shit. I'm a petite 5'2 girl. Even alone against the thief I would have been in trouble. Against 6-7? ? Fuck... Anyway... I didn’t sleep much. Maybe one hour. And got up late for work. Obviously. I hate this day. 

If you steal, seriously FUCK YOU. You do not know what people's lives are like. My parents recently divorced and I have taken over what I can of my cheating dad's responsibility. I do groceries and help mom pay rent. I do NOT have the money to pay for a new phone. I used it to go to work. Now, I make do but it's confusing as fuck. My job is my dream job with one minus: they do NOT tolerate late arrivals. 3 strikes you're out. Which I am getting closer to this morning (courtesy of a sleepless night, ended up falling asleep at almost 6 and I am supposed to wake up for for at 6:30 - woke up at 7:10. My last bus was at 7:04). So yay. Thanks again. 

Fucking assholes man. I was supposed to go back to Mondial de la biere for another day of benevolat tonight and I had such a great time there yesterday helping out and now I want to cancel because I'm scared of going home alone so late again. Memories of my almost kidnapping from when I was about 15yo flash back. 

To the thief: 

It's maybe quick easy money for you, but you made on my tears and fear. 

I FUCKING HATE YOU. 


EDIT: OMG I didn't expect people to offer their older phones. I really don't know what to choose (my brain might have short-circuited right about now) so I'll think about it a bit... I really don't want to scam anyone so I intend to make public the donating user once it is decided/set-up (if that's okay) but seriously seriously THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE. (I'm studying Japanese a bit so just picture me making a proper bow on the last sentence.)

EDIT 2: So I'm going to meet Sublime19 for his 3gs. It's as close as it gets to what I had (iphone4, 8gig) and it'll give me time to plan my finances around buying a new phone. *Does anyone know where I can unlock a telus iphone for rogers?*

Here's what wiki has to say about it: ""The service plays musical selections similar to song suggestions entered by a user. The user provides positive or negative feedback for songs chosen by the service, which are taken into account for future selections.""

In a nutshell, it learns what type of music you like and it plays music in that same genre/type. It's pretty useful to discover new bands and tracks.

Here's the problem however, it's a US only website. Thankfully, we live in the age of information and information is a useful weapon against problems.

This is a proxy which will mask your canadian IP and replace it with an american IP (it can easily be disabled/re enabled).

Do you guys think they're will be a bubble pop in the next few years? 

We're strictly talking about island of Montreal and Verdun because our public transit is well rooted there, but other places like Laval/Longueuil/etc is considered. Personally, while Laval does have its perks, lack of public transit doesn't make up for the ridiculous prices new condo devs are setting.

**additional info** : I'm mostly looking to buy a place in which I could live in permanently as opposed to reselling it (so ideally, a 4 1/2 and I'm starting to see some popping up for around 199 999$ lately...which seems...oookay). I see some places selling a 3 1/2 for 250 000$ with a crappy bathroom which is absolutely ridiculous. I would much rather live in a condo that's a triplex/duplex as opposed to one that's 10, 30 units with exorbant condo fees.",,False,,t5_2qnmr,1352750113.0,,,True,t3_132bu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/132bu5/condo_purchase_in_montreal_discussion/,

I don't want to give too much information about her here, but she makes things and sells them in a few small shops.

I built her a nice website, and we were careful to make it nicely bilingual - every single page had a link to a french version of the same page. Apparently this wasn't good enough, because some loyal citizen complained to the Office de la Langue Française, who contacted my friend ordering her to make it completely bilingual or face a fine.

We went through and made sure every last bit of text was in french, including a couple of buttons and the brand's tagline under the logo. She then received a message that this *still* wasn't good enough. She called for more info, and it seems the only thing left was for her to translate the brand name in the logo.

She has a really nice logo, and the brand name is a semi-pun that loses its punch when translated into French (but it's simple enough that the meaning is obvious to any French speakers). We both couldn't believe that she'd have to change it - if you go to the Canadian Tire website and click the ""French"" link, does it switch to ""Pneu Canadien""?

She was told that if she doesn't switch the logo in a week's time, her one-person company will be taken to court. We have no choice but to comply, of course, but this just seems so ludicrous. I know what happens when people ask for legal advice on reddit, but does anyone have any insight into this at all?

**Edit:** There seems to be a consensus that she might be able to just add a French word to the name, although a number of people have mentioned that the English part might have to be trademarked first...? I'd seen a lot of mention of that strategy online but can't find a clear answer.

As for the passions this post has stirred up, I thought I'd make it clear that the French part of the website is *entirely* French, my friend is bilingual, and she gladly communicates with customers in both languages. The English brand name isn't any grand marketing scheme or attack on the French language, it just seemed like a good name.

Thanks for all the advice!

**FindMichelleYu's Status:**
    Thank-you for joining us this past week in prayer and in action. This has been a difficult time for the Yu family and they have been overwhelmed by all the support and love they have received.

We are ecstatic to let you know that contact has been made with Michelle. She is safe. The family requests that you respect their privacy at this time.

Thank you again for all your help.

On Tuesday April 17th, [Michelle Yu](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/537960_399529360068399_398192830202052_1378154_836722935_n.jpg), a grade 12 Toronto student went missing. She was last seen in person at 2:30pm at York Mills Station and on camera at 6pm in downtown Toronto. She was on her way to meeting a friend and attending a girl guides meeting at 3pm before communication was promptly cut off.

None of her family or friends have heard from her since. Here are the important details:

1. It is uncharacteristic of her to run away. Her family and close friends do not believe this is likely.

2. At 6pm on Tuesday, a camera captured her image at a bank at Bay and Queen St (downtown Toronto), where she had withdrawn money. This was not her usual bank and was out of the way of her planned route.

3. Her phone has been off since 3pm on Tuesday the 17th.

4. She has a heart condition that requires daily medication, which she is currently without because it is at home.

  Considering the circumstances (especially her heart condition), this is a VERY URGENT situation. At the moment, **police are NOT organizing ground searches**, and there are only a few minutes of local news coverage every night about this. This is why we NEED the internet to help spread her image, so that citizens can fill the void and effectively be this constant search party. It has been 5 days, and she could be anywhere in Canada by now if she has been abducted, so we have to inform people in Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Hamilton, Halifax, London, EVERYWHERE, in order to stand a chance. These first few days are crucial and may very well be the difference in a life or death situation.

**https://www.facebook.com/FindMichelleYu**

(Press the gear icon on the top right, and it will present to you a menu option to ""Share"" to your timeline)  

Though liking the page will give you updates on the situation, the most important thing you can do to help is **""sharing"" the page on your facebook timeline.** This will spread her image to **new social networks**. Currently, her image is being passed through networks of mutual friends and mutual-mutual friends. However, we need **strangers** - people that are not closely connected to Michelle's friends' networks - to **really spread awareness and have the ""virality"" take off.** **This is why reddit may actually be *the* most important resource right now.** If you have not seen this story in your fb newsfeed recently, you actually have the greatest ability to help her. More degrees of separation = More unique people and more exposure, the better chance we have of finding Michelle.

March 1st: It's been two weeks, sore throat is getting worse, I decided to go to the walk in clinic. Wait 6 hours, doctor says it's nothing and that I should go home. Gives me a referral to see a ENT which I get an appointment for on April 25th. (Almost two months later)

March 14th: Sore throat still persistent so I return to the walk in clinic, I get a different doctor, he checks my throat like the last doctor did and says it's probably nothing but makes me do blood work. (wait time about 6 hours, blood work comes back negative)

March 28: I'm getting really frustrated and anxious at this point, my shoulder is not getting better plus I have to deal with this sore throat issue so I decide to yet again to go to the walk in clinic, I get ANOTHER doctor this time, a female who right away notices a lump on the right side of my adam's apple (on my thyroid gland). Recommends I do an ultra sound. 

March 29th: I decide to do the ultra sound privately since going to the hospital will take about 3 months wait time. The doctor calls me saying there is in fact something on my thyroid gland. She tells me to get an appointment with an ENT to which I tell her I already have one, she asks me ""when is it?"" I tell her April 25th, she says you better call this other clinic and try to see if they can see you sooner. So I call the other clinic, they can see me on the 18th (today).

April 18th: Today, I am happy I will finally know what the FUCK is going on, possibly have peace of mind that I don't cancer and hopefully be able to focus on my shoulder recovery. and hopefully get treated seeing I can barely fucking swallow. I get to the clinic, wait 2 hours, the doc sees me 5 minutes and gives me ANOTHER FUCKING REFERRAL to go to the hospital now for a Biopsy (which I thought was why I was seeing this fucking guy in the first place).

Here's a link to the event on FB: http://www.facebook.com/events/312475952131628/

For those who do not have access to FB, here's all the info:

ENGLISH:

On Friday, February 10th 2012. We will be protesting against the Internet censorship and anti-digital rights provisions of Bill C-11, which would threaten to:
* Make it illegal to unlock a DVD or video game you own for fair dealing purposes.
* Make it illegal to obtain the tools required to unlock a cell phone or transfer a commercial DVD to another device.
* Make it illegal to unlock an eBook for research or private study purposes.

“Unfortunately Bill C-32 falls short of meeting the government’s stated intentions. The core message, ‘thou shalt not steal’ is diluted by such a bewildering array of exceptions that if anything the situation for creators will grow worse.”
- Michael Geist

Michael Geist, a renown Canadian Law professor, also writes: ""The music industry alone is seeking over a dozen changes to the bill, including website blocking, Internet termination for alleged repeat infringers, and an expansion of the ""enabler"" provision that is supposedly designed to target pirate sites. Meanwhile, the Entertainment Software Association of Canada also wants an expansion of the enabler provision along with further tightening of the already-restrictive digital lock rules.""

And don't forget to sign the petition! http://openmedia.ca/lockdown

1339189433.0,61,self.montreal,us6ew,The 'dirt' on Crescent Street,bopollo,87,26,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/us6ew/the_dirt_on_crescent_street/,"On the thread ""Why do F1 protesters hate rich people"", I saw a lot of opinions and assertions about how Crescent Street works.  I worked in multiple bars on Crescent for many years, and I felt compelled to share some experiences.

The Crescent Street Merchant's Association is the cartel of extremely rich entrepreneurs that make Crescent what it is.  They collude to keep prices artificially high, and they bribe politicians and city officials to get away with breaking labour laws, fire code, hygiene standards, and to get municipal bylaws changed at their convenience.

In 2005, many of the bars on the street started to force their staff to payout a percentage of their tips to the house.  It's illegal, but they do it anyways.  Staff are only paid for time spent on the floor until 3 am.  This doesn't include the 1-2 hours it usually takes to clean up, and if business is slow, waitresses are often asked to wait in the staff room, unpaid, until more customers arrive.  Training is unpaid.  Waitresses are often forced to wear high heels.  Waitresses are pressured into dressing 'sexier'.  Sexual harassment against waitresses is a daily occurrence, but mainly from owners, managers, and other staff, rather than customers.  Illegal immigrants work the kitchens and clean the dishes, and I've heard of wages as low as $3 an hour.  Staff are often subject to all manner of intimidation, manipulation, and exploitation by their employers.  

If you want a job on Crescent, it can be a good idea to say that you have no experience in bars.  It's a widely held belief among managers and bosses that 'virgin' waitresses are less likely to cause trouble.

One large group that is particularly exploited is all the non-French-speaking staff who can only find jobs on Crescent.  A typical Crescent bar will have numerous employees from Canada, the US, and all over the Commonwealth.  I used to work a shift where I was the only non-Australian in the bar. 

During Grand Prix, every bar is well beyond its legal capacity.  Fire escapes are often blocked because storage space is always limited.

Hygiene is truly shocking, but staff take the blame when it causes a problem, so they get very adept at hiding it.  One constant problem is related to plumbing.  Most of the buildings on Crescent were once houses, and the plumbing on the street simply wasn't built to handle the capacity required on a typical busy night.  This means that raw sewage frequently backs up into sinks where glasses get a light cleaning and where ice is stored.  Another constant problem is fruit flies getting into sugary-alcohol bottles.  I haven't ordered a cocktail in years.

Inspectors see all of these things, but after a quick meeting with the boss, the bar gets away with a warning.  Again.

Naturally, everyone cheats on their taxes.

This is just a small taste of the corruption and crony-capitalism that is eating away at Quebec like a cancer.  I have no ethical problem with disrupting the Grand Prix festivities on Crescent.

EDIT Big mistake on my part.  This all really only applies to bars/restaurants that are north of St-Catherine.  I have much love for Hatters, Hurley's and Bru.

I had an appointment at the Cavendish Mall after work today. I get there a bit early, and there's this blind guy there tapping his cane around. He must've heard me, because he started talking to me. So I take out my headphones and we do the weird French/English dance that I still haven't gotten the hang of. Anyway, there was one of those clothes sales outside one of the stores, and the guy wants to know if they have any red polo shirts. I put my elbow into his hand to guide him, and walk over to the rack of shirts.

I start looking around the rack, and sure enough, there's a red polo shirt, but it's just out of reach. It's one of those rotating racks, so I start turning it to pull the red shirt closer, and all of a sudden, there's a loud crash. The ""50% off"" sign on the rack knocked over a mannequin standing nearby. I'm starting to question the idiot who set up the display in this way, and I move to go pick up the mannequin, when I notice a little girl on the bench next to the fallen mannequin. She's crying and crying because she had a cake with her that I guess she'd decorated and the mannequin had skimmed the icing a bit.

I'm pretty sure I'm the worst person in the world at this point, so I'm trying to reassure this crying kid that no, you can't really tell where the icing got smudged (she was maybe 12, it wasn't a very good icing job anyway!) I'm thinking of all the cakes I decorated when I was her age, and I'm envisioning her in the future, sitting in a jail cell, attributing all her failures and lawbreaking to back when she was a pre-teen and this monstrous woman smashed her cake with a freaking mannequin. After a minute, I think to ask the girl where her parents were and she tells me they left her there. That's when I start to get paranoid, and go with the completely logical theory that this is some sort of elaborate pocket-picking setup, so I clutch my purse tighter to my body. All of a sudden, she stops crying.

""It's... it's okay,"" she says.

""It is?"" I'm beyond confused at this point.

""You know why?"" she asks.

""Why's that?""

""Because you're on Just For Laughs! Look! There's a camera! There's another camera!""

Then we did a little dance, I signed a release, and went off to my appointment. Now to turn this into a rage comic to reap me some karma.",,False,,t5_2qnmr,False,,,True,t3_j67qy,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/j67qy/hazards_of_living_in_montreal_other_than_road/,

Tout d'un coup l'un des 4 met une cagoule, commence à me regarder. Je fais à semblant que je lis... Ils commencent à se lever, parler plus fort, rire et finalement, un autre se lève et commence à se battre légèrement avec celui déjà levé, qui décide de sortir un couteau et de faire à semblant de poignarder quelqu'un dans ""l'air"". Finalement, après avoir fait peur à tout le monde dans le putain de wagon, ils sortent, sans rien faire d'autre, une dizaine de stations plus tard, downtown.  

Seriously, what the fuck, je commence à être vraiment écoeuré de me faire chier comme ça dans le métro. Je déteste quand ce genre de merde arrive, et ça arrive de plus en plus souvent. 

P.S. Nothing wrong avec les arabes, j'ai des origines tunisiennes; c'était juste vraiment le stéréotype montréalais des ptits douches arabes racailles du métro...

**UPDATE**: I called the police department for my arrondissement, who told me to call the non-emergency number for 911 (514-280-2222). I then explained the noise complaint to the operator, who said they would dispatch a patrol unit.

I received a call about 2 hours later from a police officer who visited the site and determined that, although the construction chief claimed he had a special permit, he could not reach the contractor to prove it. The officer gave them a fine and ordered them to shut down the site within 30 minutes.

Here's the law the prosecutor claims is applicable to my case: 

[Reglemen RCA11 22005 - Chapitre IV - Section 1 - #64](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/sel/sypre-consultation/afficherpdf?idDoc=22879&amp;typeDoc=1)

&gt;64.
À moins qu'un règlement ne l'autorise, il est interdit de se tenir sur le domaine public
ou sur la partie extérieure d'une propriété privée située à moins de 6 m du domaine public
pour offrir, moyennant contrepartie, ses services ou ceux d'autrui à une personne, l'inviter
à entrer ou se rendre à un lieu d'affaires, la photographier sans son consentement ou lui
offrir de la photographier, lui remettre un article publicitaire, un coupon ou un certificat
permettant d'obtenir un article, une marchandise ou autre service avec ou sans
contrepartie, ou obtenir une clientèle pour soi-même ou pour autrui.
Quiconque contrevient au présent article commet une infraction du type 2. 

The prosecutor told me I needed the security guard's permission to take his photograph, but since she had no statement from the guard, she had to acquit me.

I find this acquittal sucks. The prosecutor insisted over and over that what I did was illegal, and that she was only acquitting me on some technical crap...  ignoring the fact that I never did anything illegal to begin with.

For those wanting to see the pictures: http://imgur.com/a/ZzdRH the guard moved in front of me and refused to get out of my shot, he even followed me and kept standing in front of me, to block the shot.

TL;DR: I was given a ticket for taking photos of the 'Warm Bodies' movie set while standing on a downtown street corner that was open to the public. I was just acquitted on the grounds that there was not enough evidence since the security guard had not given a statement. The prosecutor told me it was illegal to take someone's photo without their permission.",,False,,t5_2qnmr,1366825084.0,,,True,t3_1cyxfm,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1cyxfm/update_i_was_acquitted_photography_in_public/,

She was in crutches and claimed she broke her toes on one foot.  

When I went to help her she wouldn't budge and started telling me a sob story.   She claimed to be a visiting PhD from the University of Ottawa and that she was having a horrible time getting back to her place west of Ville St-Laurent.

She claimed to have no money to take a taxi and no one to call for help.  She then asked me to go get money from an ATM so she could hail a cab and she promised to pay me back.

My gut told me something was wrong (there are more details to her story that didn't sound right) so I made up some excuse not to give her cash and she got pissed.

Anyways, if someone approaches you near McGill with the same story...beware.

____________________________________________________________________________

***Letter to members and BIXI users***  

In the past days, much has been said about BIXI that does not correspond to the reality. Therefore it seems essential to restore the facts, particularly now that the plan proposed by the City was finally well-received by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs after more than five months of delay and waiting. The following serves as a clarification regarding some of the allegations which have been circulating in the media.  

	
**“BIXI is a financial disaster and is not profitable”: FALSE.** BIXI experienced a liquidity problem which was the direct result of a five-month wait for the approval by the Municipal Affairs Minister of its agreement with the City of Montreal. BIXI is a company which experienced rapid growth and realized, after only 2 years, volumes of some $50 million. BIXI also posted results that were 40% greater than the projected budget, thanks in large part to the successful expansion of its system internationally. BIXI does not have a profitability problem nor is BIXI a financial disaster in any way.  


**“The Montreal operation of BIXI is not profitable”: TRUE.** From the beginning, the business plan projected that the Montreal operation of the system would not derive profits in the first years of operation. The plan also indicated that operational costs would be covered once BIXI reached 50,000 members and with the involvement of sponsorship. Proud of the 30,000 members at the end of 2010, we have currently exceeded the level of 40,000 members after only one month of operation in our new 2011 season.  


**“Montreal is absorbing the BIXI debt”: FALSE.** The City gives no money to BIXI. Montreal advanced a loan to BIXI. The initial loan to BIXI in the amount of $37 million is repayable with interest. This loan was accorded to cover conceptualization costs of the system, the patents, the manufacturing and delivery of the components (bikes and stations), the operation losses of the first years as well as the start up costs. This loan is presently owed to Stationnement de Montréal.  


**“The city is giving $108 million to BIXI”: FALSE.** Let us take the time to properly understand the numbers that make up the whole. 
$37 million : this amount is a loan to BIXI repayable with interest. The remaining $71 million, guaranteed by the City of Montreal, is comprised of a financing package negotiated with the National Bank subsequent to a tender notice. 


It consists of a revolving line of credit of $6 million, as is standard for all businesses; a letter of credit facility up to $5 million for deposit guarantees for all public offerings which is a standard practice with the guarantees rescinded after the process. 


A factoring facility up to $60 million offered by the Bank to finance accounts receivable which allows for the necessary liquidity to pay our suppliers while waiting for the cities with whom we do business to effect the payment of our invoices. This facility can only be used when a contract is signed by a city in good and due form.  


**“Montrealers are financing the export of the BIXI system to other markets”: FALSE.** It is, in fact, the contrary. Montrealers fully benefit from the export of the BIXI system to other markets. Last year, it is the successes of the sales of BIXI ($8.5 million) on the international scale that covered the operational deficit of Montreal ($7 million). In this way, we were able to achieve a surplus of $1.5 million and offer a quality system to Montrealers.	  


**“We have a luxurious bike costing $7,400 compared to Barcelona with a bike costing $75”: FALSE.** BIXI does not cost $7,000, no more than it costs $3,500, heard on television. The Barcelona bike does not cost $75. The Barcelona bike costs more than 600 €, basically the same cost of our bike. How could we sell with such success on three continents if the bike costs so much? The Montreal bike is likely the most solid and best conceived bike in the world. Its reliability is greater than the bikes currently used in other cities.	 


**“BIXI employs 450 people”: FALSE.** BIXI employs 50 people and has created more than 400 employees at different suppliers everywhere in the region for the manufacturing of the diverse components of the system.
Our business plan is clear. It has been presented publically. We remain in line with the business plan and once again count on respecting these objectives again this year. The plan outlines clearly that the system will cost nothing to Montrealers.

1324951776.0,56,self.montreal,nrr6n,Stopped Robbery in the Metro. Again !? Welcome  to the Holidays.,aardvark2zz,64,8,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/nrr6n/stopped_robbery_in_the_metro_again_welcome_to_the/,"tl;dr: Stopped a robbery on the metro. 2 young men cornered another man in his seat. At first I thought they knew each other. They started slapping him and finally he turned around and said he was being ""taxed"". I approached them and asked for the victim to get out of his corner seat. The other dudes wouldn't let him out of the seat. I said LOUDLY to release him. They didn't want to. He finally was able to get out very very slowly and I told him to pull the emergency handle. Because of this I thought the thieves were cornered at the next station but NOOOO the doors opened and they left !!??? I thought they kept the doors closed until things were clarified.

They stole his Xmas watch, headphones, and almost got the iPod. In the metro you're on your own.

2nd time this happened to me; and that`s just December. The crazies came out.

**Edit 3am:** If someone cares I can comment on other ""incidents"".

**Edit 2pm:** I believe this is the 1st confirmed robbery I have ever seen in the metro. So I believe that you're relatively safe in the metro. I can only comment on stations between Atwater and Pie-IX. If you're really worried just watch-out for the 2-8 person agitated gangs aged 16-25 with strong accents. 

What's extremely frustrating is that the police, and stm security do **NOTHING** unless there is confirmed physical aggression. These gangs can scream at you, swear extreme obscenities at you, even say words like ""kill you"", get to within 1 inch of your face, follow you, and nothing will happen to them. I've seen this soooo many times ! If they punch out a window from its frame and they're minors then the fine is guess ......  eighteen dollars !!

Another frustrating and funny thing is I'll have complete strangers try to intervene and stop me from talking to criminals. Mostly it's women :-O  I'm finally use to it, and I'm expecting it !

**Edit 3pm:** tl;dr
&gt; - Note: All this happens very fast and sometimes it 1st appears to be young people who know each other.
&gt; - 3wks ago. Unconscious or dead man on cement near metro ticket agent, 5 ft from me, not moving with $200 cash on the floor. 2 dudes arrive and one of them puts his own wallet next to the cash pretending that it's his own cash. I loudly tell him to knock it off and that I'll arrest him. He laughs as if nothing. 6pm, 20 year olds, accents.
&gt; - 18 months ago, 3pm, **metro empty**, girl sits 12 ft in front of me. One 19 yr old dude comes in at another station and sits besides her !? I thought they knew each other but I see her squirm in her seat and he has his coat on top of his legs with his right hand under his coat. I eventually loudly tell him are you OK. He's really annoyed with me and gets off the next station. She thanks me **only** when she got off much later :-O
&gt; - 2 yrs ago. 11pm. Half asian long-hair blond guy gets on, along with 2 tall dudes with very strong accents, non asians. Blond pretends to sleep sitting down, 1 of the 2 dudes gets extremely close to him to talk to him in a strong loud accent. I thought that they knew each other. Blond guy runs off at Beaudry. Later the dude approaches a very quiet black girl sitting alone far and behind me and not replying to the dude. All of a sudden I hear a very loud bang. I turn around and the dude had just strongly punched the seat beside her twice.
&gt; - 2 yrs ago at Guy, 10pm, I see a demure 18 yr old approaching and talking to a 6 person gang, some push and pull, I assumed they knew each other, metro almost full, I assume there can't be a crime going on since there are so many people. Then all of a sudden the demure man gets pushed to the floor and gets kicked REALLY HARD to the head and it also hits the cement wall. **THAT WAS A REAL BAD DOUBLE HIT !** In hindsight I assume the victim was robbed by the gang and received a concussion. Accents.
&gt; - I'm off to meet a friend downtown via metro. Wish me luck ;-)

**Edit 9pm:** 
&gt; - Atwater station, poor old short metro driver desperately running trying to fix the train, 17 yr old dude (of 7 dudes) at top of stairs with a racoon-hat, screaming extreme obscenities to poor old driver. I look up to dude and he starts doing exactly the same to me. I climb up the stairs and start SCREAMING same obscenities 1 inch from his face. I hope there's cops nearby. Cops show up by coincidence. I'm telling them the story but they say they can't do anything and slowly move backwards from me !??? I'm wondering why they're so quiet and nervous !!??? I look to my left and there's a 40 yr old black man filming us trying to frame us for any racism !!!??? Not only time I see black men filming cops !! Next time, I'll film a black man filming the cops and put it on Youtube !
&gt; - [VIDEO, while doing a long walk I saw a police raid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gXKnL-7ZF2A) on the most well known strip joint downtown. But then a 35 yr old dude is placated by 4 cops against the window of a store. I hear him screaming ""I did not say I'll kill you, I said I pity you officer"". He repeats over and over ""I did not say I will kill you"". Even with 7 cops around him he doesn't believe he's under arrest. He claims that he doesn't have any vulgar words in him and then he screams ""you bastards"", ""putain"", etc.... Notice the cops trying to block the view. Strong france-ish accent.

I was on the greenline around 7/7:30pm and the metro came to a sudden halt before fully entering Place des Arts, I was in the last car.

There was a thin smoke coming from the car beside mine, and very quickly, a panicked mob in that car formed. Banging frantically trying to get out.we were beside a metro going in the opposite direction and the driver of that metro just sort of, casually watched as panicked metro riders seemed to be begging for help.

All this brouhaha made everyone in my car get nervous. There was certainly something in the air, but not smoke and no visible fire, but here we all are watching a panic form and made everyone in my car including myself wonder just wtf is going. Eventually, the passengers managed to pry open the door (which was a lot harder to do than I remember) and everyone in my car crossed cars and we got onto the platform.

It took five minutes before people were able to get out. The culprit? Some drunk or drugged up asshole pulled a fire extinguisher inside the car.

It took another five minutes before an STM employee went around unlocking the doors to all the other cars full of passengers who haven't a clue why they are trapped inside a powered down metro.

To me, this was extremely unprofessional. First off, the metro driver in the other metro could see that there is no fire, but a real emergency was brewing, a MOB PANIC. There should have been a much faster response to let people out, even if it means that who ever causes this mess in the first place escapes justice. That panicked mob seemed minutes away from breaking down the windows just to get out.

so imagine if that were a real fire. Then what? Sure, you could hop inbetween cars, but that's a choke point and not exactly a great way to get 100 people away from danger. The whole situation reeked of poor planning.

The good side to this story, is that for once, I finally saw a valid reason with my own two eyes for a metro delay, and next time the metro is delayed, I might not be so quick to judge the STM on broken down metros. But I will judge them on what seemed to be a total inability to deal with a potential crisis, even if the cause of said crisis wasn't critical at all.",,False,,t5_2qnmr,False,,,True,t3_hj9gc,http://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/hj9gc/i_dont_think_anyone_would_survive_a_real_fire_on/,

I'm just putting this out there to see if by any chance a miracle happens:
I was at the gym yesterday and i left my watch, phone and ring in my locker *LOCKED*. I come back, those three things are gone. The first two can be replaced, but the most important piece of the trio is my ring, heres a description: 

Its gold on top and silver band, maybe about 80 years old. Not very expensive, only about 10 carat gold on sterling silver. Its got scratches and imperfections on the face and has the initials J.P.R. engraved on the face. It belonged to my grandfather and my family passed it to me when i graduated high school. I'm offering a reward for any information that helps me get it back.

La connexion 30mbps de Vidéotron me coûte presque 90$ par mois, mais pourquoi? Ça sert a rien! On ne peut même pas utiliser l'internet normalement.

Même en révisant mes estimations vers le bas, on ""Bust"" le quota.

Vidéotron! Votre vendeur m'a dit en me vendant mon Nexus One il y a 1 ans que vous voulez être parmis les gros joueurs de la télécommunication; Ça veut dire innover, être chef de file, offrir mieux que la compétition. En ce moment vous me coûtez une fortune et vous offrez des quotas qui seraient réalistes il y a 5 ans.

Et pour ceux / celles qui me diront ""Switch to techsavy"", j'aimerais bien, mais j'ai un contrat de 3 ans.

**[EDIT]**: 500Mo/10 minutes pour Stream HD, au lieu de 1Go.

Selon nos informations, corroborées par trois sources confidentielles au courant du dossier, cet incident préoccupant - qui aurait pu avoir de graves conséquences - serait survenu la semaine dernière, à la suite de sa première journée de comparution devant la commission Charbonneau.

Gerald Tremblay dit avoir recu des ""avertissements""

«J'ai une famille et des enfants. Je ne voudrais pas me ramasser avec des problèmes. J'en ai assez comme ça. Moi, je suis capable de prendre la pression comme individu, comme maire de Montréal, mais je ne peux pas demander à ma famille et à mes enfants de faire la même chose.»

Gerald Tremblay est maintenant protégé par le Service de protection des témoins de la Sûreté du Québec. Plusieurs voiture de police sont maintenant placés autour de son restaurant. Il y aussi plusieurs voitures de police devant sa maison.

Il doit desormais dormir a l'hotel.

Feel free to ask about immigration in general, your case in particular, or any other bureaucracy affecting newcomers to Quebec: driver's licenses, taxes, social insurance, French language tests, et cetera.  Also feel free to ask about any of the less official aspects of immigration to Quebec.

So I have decided to tell you what I think about Montreal, or even Quebec, Canada or North-America in general.

 I might say something very stupid, I'm sorry if I do that. English is also not my native language.

* (1) CARS : People in Montreal have big cars compared to France, Germany or the UK. 
And there are no french cars (Peugeot/Renault)

* (2) I kept wondering when I first saw... ""Je me souviens"" OUI MAIS DE QUOI ?

* (3) The Urban Area, is so fucking HUGE. I mean there are suburbs in Germany or France but it seems that people here don't like high building and metros so they build suburbs. It seems like the city has no limits.. Laval.. Laval is so BIG ! Laval alone is larger than the size of Paris municipality  !

* (4) It seems to me that there is this ""North American way"" which means that I have the impression that people are always trying to take money in weird ways.

In France you go buy something, it's written ""10"" you actually pay ""10""
In Lebanon you go buy something, it's written ""10"" you actually pay ""10""
In Norway you go buy something it's written ""10"" you actually pay ""10""

Here I go buy something that costs ""10"" then they tell me 

""Well..taxes aren't included so let's add this and that and that"" and ""please add the tips because they don't make minimum wage""

Or there are ""action fees"" and ""special fees"" and ""credit card interest""

""It wasn't written on the price ? Why should we write it ?"" 

It seems that corporations are trying very hard to find new ways to make money.

* (5) The healthcare system seems fucked up. I waited 6 hours in an emergency. I was told ""I was lucky"". People are like ""well..at least it's still better the USA"". I can only imagine how fucked up it is in the USA then...

Also : Urgences-Santé c'est des gros voleurs ! From a 1.9  kilometer ride they charged me more than 450 dollars ! I mean there is NO WAY that they need that much money for such a distance. If they just decide ""better be lazy"" and decide to take 8 people a day (8 for 8 hours) that means 8X450X30=  108.000 dollars :/

According to LaPresse they still need more money 

http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/quebec-canada/sante/201207/07/01-4541679-urgences-sante-court-apres-des-millions.php

* 6) The Girls are beautiful

* 7) I love the fact that there seems to be cultural events going in Montreal all the time !

* 8) People seem very respectful and polite in general but sometimes try to avoid conflicts no matter what. Like instead of telling you upfront something they just don't. There is a ""non confrontation"" culture.

* 9) The Anglo/French thing.

I'm in an Anglo neighborhood and I speak a lot of English here. So I figured out Montreal was bilingual. Then I realized the area from McGill to Westmount is an Anglo stronghold.

Language seems like a really sensitive issue. And I still don't get exactly what is Quebec culture except the language. I mean sure , I read about it (catholic, etc..) but when I watch people in general, they go to mac donalds, have ford cars, etc..

But I never say anything because I know it's a super super sensitive issue.

* 10) Quebec flag is fucking awesome

So I'm posting it again in hopes that I, and other knowledgable folks on our subreddit, can help some more people out.

First things first: I'm not an immigration professional, lawyer, or in other way formally qualified to answer your questions.

That said, I am in the process of immigrating to Quebec, and, in my seven years here, have helped many others through the process from immigrant to citizen. I've taken several people to permanent resident landings in Lacolle, helped dozens of people apply for work and study permits, done a permanent resident landing myself, and have lots of tips and tricks to get through it as painlessly as possible.

Feel free to ask about immigration in general, your case in particular, or any other bureaucracy affecting newcomers to Quebec: driver's licenses, taxes, social insurance, French language tests, et cetera. Also feel free to ask about any of the less official aspects of immigration to Quebec.

Let's start a conversation. Et, bien sûr, il va sans dire qu'on devrait pas hesitez à répondre en français.

I live in Tétraultville (Ho-MA) and my cat has gone missing.

He has his claws, though isn't an outdoor car - he slipped out and just kept running (not sure where). This cat is my baby, and his brother is crying for him (he's been MIA for a solid 2 hours now). I walked around the area, drove around the block, and I'm going to just sit out my back porch with some food praying he comes back soon.

He is white and brown, has beautiful outlined eyes, and has a signature little spot on his nose. 

This is him: http://i.imgur.com/OX7jX.jpg

Please please please if you see him, or catch him, please give me a shout. I'll cook you a feast of a dinner, paint you a Mona Lisa, anything.

Thank you
