[[Suggestion to Carbine] Give WildStar Redditors keys - WildStar Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1ezwkv/suggestion_to_carbine_give_wildstar_redditors_keys/)

The OP expressed his desire for Carbine to give loyal followers here @ Reddit keys, but that simply isn't possible (other than in the form of a giveaway) since Carbine doesn't have access to the email addresses of all the subscribers to this subreddit. 

I don't agree with the notion that we ""deserve"" keys more than anyone else, but should Carbine wish to target us with beta keys it would be nice for them to have the ability to do so.

That's when I realized that if we wanted to be recognized by Carbine, we had to use the tools they've given us. We need to form a ""Gaming Group"" so that they can properly target us with invites (should they choose to).

Here's what I came up with (I came up with the tag ""WSSR"" which resembles ""USSR"", although we won't require Communism for membership :p lol).

[BETA APP GUILD INFO](http://i.imgur.com/fvgDWpa.png)

Entire the info in the image above in your beta app when you submit it (you can revise your earlier app by using the same info you used before I believe). That will group us all together in their system and will make it much easier for them to target us in the future.

Let me know your thoughts on the subject. Anything that increases our chances of getting beta invites is a good thing in my book. :)

Here's the info in text for those too lazy to type :p lol (thanks to UltimateNoodle for reminding me).

1369330446.0,146,self.WildStar,1ewy8h,"Lots of Mostly New Info from Two-Hour Dev Interview -- Mostly PvP, Combat, Group Finder)",clisby,158,12,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1ewy8h/lots_of_mostly_new_info_from_twohour_dev/,"If you don't feel like watching an info-dense two-hour dev interview at http://www.twitch.tv/oppositionpodcast/b/407007808 I have summed it up below.

**Combat**    
   
- There is the possibility for tab targetting for less skilled players BUT they will never be as effective as a free form targetting.
- Tab targetting does NOT guaruntee the ability will hit the targetted player.  Tab targetting essentially aims you at the target
- Telegraphs can be any shape and size.  You can even have inverse telegraphs.
- The combat system is not based entirely on telegraphs
- You cannot cast mid-jump for most spells, but there are some where you can
- Abilities are usually resource based/restricted(mana) but are sometimes cooldown based
- **THERE IS NO AUTO-ATTACK**
- There is a ""basic-attack"" mapped to right-click.  This basic attack does trigger the global cooldown
- Some classes have up to 90% telegraphed abilities.  Some closer to 50%
- To avoid overwhelming raids, they currently only show your own telegraphs and the enemy creature's telegraphs.  I'm assuming they are talking about offensive telegraphs, not heals and buff bubbles.  May just have the options to turn it on and off.
- Beyond telegraphs, there is the possibility of a character to evade attacks automatically.  Likely RNG and stat driven.  We have seen this on media demos.
- Listening to player feedback to get rid of standard rotations
- Trying to avoid ""number inflation"" to keep damage numbers low
- GCD duration (observed from demo) -- ~1.5s (give or take my reaction speed borking it up)

**Shields**    

- Health does not regenerate while in combat
- Tech Shields regenerate a set amount of time after you are last hit (even if still in combat)
- There are abilities which specifically target and heal tech shields
- There are abilities which ignore tech shields
- There are also absorption shields which are ""treated differently"" than tech shields.  Said ""magical"" so I'm guessing they are cast by a spell/healer class.
- Tech Shields are itemized.  You will pick up better tech shields as you play.


**CC**    

- No current diminishing return on CC, but not ruling it out.
- **CC's are more powerful in PvE than in PvP.**  Because of the ""breakout system"" they can weaken/strengthen CC in PvP without effecting PvE
- Always give a player a goal or activity when they are in a form of CC to help them escape (retrieving a sword that was knocked out of the player's hand, player can extend the CC by blocking you from getting the weapon!!)
- *Interrupt Armor* is something that can be cast or applied to you.  For example if you want to cast a channeled spell you could cast Interrupt Armor on yourself first.  
- You can apply *interrupt armor* on teammates
- *Interrupt Armor* can prevent ALL *hard* forms of CC(implied not things like slows).  The Interrupt Armor is a bar that can decrement down to zero and then you are able to be CC'd.
- **Telegraph time for abilities are tuned to NEVER be lower than standard latency** meaning you should always have the chance to dodge...  assuming no delay in reaction time such as 0 people in the world.

**Classess**    

- *Perhaps* a bow and arrow class.  Little bit of laughter, so give it a small chance of being true.
- One of the unannounced classes can spec healing
- No healer is definitively better than another.  Any benefits of one over another is purely situational.
- Stalkers will be less likely to actually be hit when tanking.  They are experimenting with giving them a higher chance to ""evade"" autoattacks.
- ""Might have pets.  Might not have pets.  This is redacted""  When asked about a pet class
- Definitely strong trinity system (unlike GW2)
- Currently swapping specs is easy.  Player feedback is making them second-guess this.

 **Tanks/Heals**    
 
- Tanks and healers still have to worry about positioning and aiming
- Dedicated tanks will have a role in PvP
- Tank taunts reduce damage of player that has been taunted unless the taunted player is attacking the tank
- Tanks are great for holding/assaulting objectives in PvP
- Tanks are useful in arenas because they rarely die
- Tanks have strong support abilities to further their usefulness in PvP.
- One specific tank ability allows him to form a bubble and all allies in the bubble take reduced damage
- Healers will not be able to heal indefinitely, will have to be strategic
- Healers will add significant survivability in PvP
- Hybrid builds are possible.  Devs liked to go mostly DPS with a few ""pocket heals"" on their ability slots for Arenas
- Some healing classes are substantially more dependant on telegraphs than others

**Abilities**    

- Mobility differs between classes.  Some classes will have no channels.  Some abilities simply slow a character while casting.
- It is possible to adjust your ability set such that you will have no channels/slows while casting, despite your class.
- Abilities on bar should be active -- not buffs.  Trying to avoid having abilities with long durations.
- WildStar is programmed to allow people to use shields and life as resources (like mana) but they are not currently doing so.  It ""may or may not"" happen.
- Potential class ability that lets you swap places with a target.  They are ""trying out"" the ability to see its implications.

**Beta**    

- Stress test is likely to suck for players, so don't get antsy.
- Trying to ramp up amount of beta players quickly
- Current beta players are not having their beta names reserved.  Reserved names during beta will likely only happen very soon before release
- New waves of beta invites will be coming out every couple of weeks

**PvP**

- **Currently they are NOT showing telegraphs to players in PvP(!!!!)**.  It will benefit you to know what the telegraph for another class' abilities looks like.  This is still subject to change.
- Can level up character in PvP
- Paths will unlock abilities for use in PvP (arenas, battlegrounds, world)
- XP/time ratio of PvP should be roughly the same as PvE.  Want you to be able to level up with just PvP.
- PvP currency is present.  Can be used to buy and repair stuff(Warplots)
- There are randomized chances to win loot
- It's possible for a really skilled player to win a 1v3, 1v4 with similar gear.  It is possible for a PvP player to be consistently, overwhelmingly dominant
- Will have a ""tutorial experience""
- eSports a possibility if the community wants it -- Arenas and Warplots.
- In PvP classes take a rock-paper-scissors approach to countering each other based on ability skillset chosen
- PvP is more strategy focused than burst focused.  Currently averages 20s to kill 1v1 assuming no dodging and toe-to-toe.  Still VERY much in flux.
- No plans to allow custom matches where players can set parameters
- Using the same plug-in systems used in housing the devs can add randomized and new content to existing battlegrounds to keep play from getting stale.  This probably won't be done until post-launch.

**Dueling**    

- Very likely.  Lead PvP designer mentioned it as one of the systems she is involved in

**Crafting**    

- Circuitboard system

**Paths**    

- Devs are being careful with path abilities.  **DO NOT want you to feel it's advantageous to re-roll the same char with a different path simply because the abilities may be better.**

**Gear**    

- Raids may have the best loot but not all good gear for PvP will be locked behind top tier raids
- They are working on balance such that players can gradually build up their PvP gear
- Gear will give a definite advantage in PvP, but skill can overcome gear gaps.
- PvP gear progression scheme where good gear is from battlegrounds, great gear is arena, and best of PvP rewards are from Warplots
- Warplot gear will give you a decided advantage in arenas
- **Stats on gear will have diminishing returns!**
- Everytime there is a new tier of PvE gear released, a new tier of PvP gear will be released
- There are two PvP specific stats for gear, limiting the ability for PvP gear to be better than PvE gear. **PvP Offense** and **PvP Defense**.  You will have a base amount to start and can supplement with gear.  These two stats will mostly come from ""chips"" made from circuitboard crafting.
- PvP Offense increases damage against player targets
- PvP Defense mitigates damage from other players
- Will near definitely have an equipment ""loadout"" system where you can switch gear sets quickly.
- Assault power helps DPS
- Support power helps healing
- Damage bonuses on gear will be generic +dmg...  not anything like +fire dmg


**API**    

- **Addons mods will be coded in LUA**
- API is still in flux but is very robust.  ""Anything [Carbine] can do with the UI, [a modder] could do with the UI""
- **Code for the Carbine UI is provided so people can mess with it**
- Macros will likely be allowed, but nothing gamebreaking
- Existing add-ons include a player-made chat mod which allows a player to receive whispers which show up in a window, they can answer the question and it will show up in zone chat (devs were using).  Group frames.  Friends lists.  Gambling.

**Battlegrounds**    

- Two different types sizes of battlegrounds 10v10(10-15 minutes, current average is 11) and 15v15(little longer than 10v10).  A 30v30 one is being tested
- Unranked battlegrounds are not matchmade by skill or gear level
- You will have an ELO rating for your skill in ranked battlegrounds.  You will be matched with people of similar skill level
- Rallying system boosts everyone to top level character for battleground in stats
- No persistent battlegrounds that last for days on end (like Alterac Valley) and they have zero interest in making one
- Capture the flag is a current BG type
- Next BG rollout to beta will be an attack/defense like TF2 carts and SWTOR Void Star with ""their own little twists""
- Currently prototyping a domination-style (capture-hold) with an interesting addition at the end
- PuG's and premades are possible, but the ELO system allows adjustment for the increased ability
- You can have premade groups in battlegrounds

**World PvP**  
  
- PvE server players can flag themselves as PvP
- **Not any major objectives to do in world PvP ""yet""**
- Open world PvP has no level restrictions (and the planned PvP population plummets ;) ).  High level players will not get experience for killing low level players, however.
- Implied you get XP AND PvP currency for open-world kills
- There are diminishing returns for killing the same player
- On PvP servers you are safe in zones controlled by your faction.  If you go into a shared zone or an enemy zone, you will be flagged for PvP

**Arena PvP**    

- Current sizes are 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5
- Arena is not a standard elimination match.  They have ""team respawn lives"" -- each team can have 6 lives and when you die you use up a life
- Potential to have game-types, eventually, that are single elimination (no extra lives)
- Arena is capped at 30 minutes

**Warplots**    

- **Damage taken to warplots is persistent.  You will have to repair/rebuild/maintain after battles!**
- Paths will have influence on Warplot play, more specific than just standard PvP abilities
- Warplots is intended *for large raids* (MAX is 40v40, implying there can be smaller ones)
- Presumably more info to come as a dev said she is limited in what she can currently say.  Dev seems very excited for the information that is not yet released
- Warplot PvP expected to last closer to 45-60 minutes

**Housing**    

- Players cannot attack/steal items from another player's house
- There will be ways for you to ""interact"" with your friends in your home.  ""Rainbow deer marriage"" :)
- Access to your bank from your house
- House can offer useful character buffs
- Can be ""a hub"" (possibly portal to various areas?)
- House isn't intended for player to ""hang out"" there permanently

**PvE**

- Movement/travel abilities for each class allowing you to get from point to point quicker 
- Falling damage exists, but is very lenient currently.  Affected by gravity
- In-game flight still not decided.  ""We have some cool stuff happening which will effect that decision""
- Sprint-double-jump is very important for explorers
- Open world bosses that can take up to 20+ players
- Possible to make double-jump a factor in raids ONLY if it is obvious

**Group Finder**    

- Group Finder tool for Warplots, Battlegrounds, dungeons and ""some things we haven't talked about"" but NOT Raids.  Able to choose if you want to queue only with people on your server.  Even in cross-realm the group-finder has an affinity for grouping people on the same server.
- Group finder attempts to gather a standard group: 1 tank, 1 healer and 3 DPS....  dungeons are likely 5mans then.
- Group finder will teleport you to the dungeon entrance
- Will have a ""looking for group"" channel

**Social**    

- Still haven't decided whether they will allow cross-faction communication.  Currently disabled.
- They are considering limited forms of communication between factions
- They are not currently working on a mobile app but they are interested and would like to in the future.  This includes interaction with auction house, guild and more
- Unable to discuss whether there is a ""home base"" for guilds -- yet!

**Game General**    

- *The ability to morph into a deer that farts rainbows will debut at PAX*. They were likely *not* joking ;)
- Currently no gambling in the game (betting on PvP).  They have considered it but haven't implemented anything else.
- Use of game controllers is not officially supported but gameplay is well-suited for controllers
- Authenticator being considered as a possibility for account protection
- **Servers in EU(Frankfurt) and US(Dallas) at launch** -- maybe in more locations but they aren't ready to discuss any further.
- Mentioned wanting a good gaming experience in Australia -- possible servers in Australia?
- Big reveals to come at E3
- These guys say ""there has been no official announcement of payment model.  Even if you *think* you know something or have heard something.""
- Will have holiday events
- Implication is, thus far, anti-bot measures are limited to the fact that content is dynamic (have to dodge telegraphs, nodes of crafting materials will run away from you).  This was coming from the PvP team so there is a good chance their knowledge is limited

In terms of what we can and can't talk about today, we're open to questions about anything Combat and PvP related, though there are a few topics that are too early to talk about. Those are:

&gt;- The two remaining unannounced classes
&gt;- Warplots

We'll be back around 12PM PDT to answer your questions. Looking forward to chatting with you!

**EDIT**: Holy crap! So many awesome questions already. We're going to start tackling these in a couple minutes, keep the questions coming!

**EDIT 2**: Hey folks, we're having some ""Reddit lockout"" issues right now. We'll keep writing answers on our end, and respond as fast as we're allowed to. Apologies for the technical problems!

**EDIT 3**: Thanks so much to everyone who participated! We've got to release the devs from our Community Pit so they can get back to working on the game.

1369244812.0,113,self.WildStar,1euhyn,Highlights of The 5/22 WildStar Info Release,clisby,127,14,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1euhyn/highlights_of_the_522_wildstar_info_release/,"**Esper Class**       

- Uses ""power of mind"" to summon illusionary pets
- Not a ""pet class"" as the illusions last &lt;10 seconds
- Class uses both a mana system and charge system (focus point)
- Build up focus points with using multiple abilities like **Telekentic Strike**, **Concentrated Blades** and **Phantom Swarm**
- **Telekentic Strike**, the blade summon/toss spell, deals damage to the 3 closest enemies within a line ahead of the caster. immobilizes while casting. 1.5s cast time
- **Concentrated Blades**, the delayed release saw-looking spell, does not immobilize.  They pause for 4.4seconds prior to flying at enemy.  Generates a focus point.  There are two charges that can be stored and each has a 10s cooldown....  so no spam.
- **Mind Burst** uses charges to conjure a large hawk that swoops at a target, damaging three closest enemies in a cone.  It's a focus dump, it consumes all available focus points and does more %assault damage with each point.  Instant.
- **Crush** skill conjures a large ghost-like fist to punch enemies into the ground. Instant, 35s cooldown.  Knocks 3 enemies within 5 meters of the target enemy down for 2.5s and does damage.
- Able to summon up to three ""phantoms"" (at least)
- A video snippet shows an Esper running around with two daggers floating above her head (presumably not a bugged out version of telekenetic strike)
- **Phantom Swarm** conjures a phantom for each enemy, limited to 3, within a cone ahead of the caster.  Lasts for 10 seconds, dealing 50% assault power damage every 1.25 seconds.  instant, 10s cooldown. Generates a focus point. (one of the media guys was a mouse clicker so I got to see it all :) )

**Scientist Path**    

- Scanning a creature multiple times can unlock ""new advantages""
- Some scans can trigger audio-clips to drive you deeper into a side-quest
- A ""galactive archive"" stores what you've learned about an object (plant, race, zone, etc) so you can review it later
- Scanning gains Scientist XP, acheivements, Scanbot powers, titles, housing equipment(FABKits) and ""unlocks""
- By scanning *loftite* many times, the player can unlock its power -- allowing nearby players to get the ability to jump higher in areas with larger concentrations of loftite.  This synergized with other paths as they can get to new areas.  In this case they bounced up a cliff to find a big boss
- Small, randomized puzzles (similar to RIFT zone puzzles).  Theoretically you should not be able to find definitive solutions on the internet.
- Many things you scan will not like being scanned and will be hostile
- Moving objects around can open hidden rooms
- Can name your Scanbot
- Mission Types: Analysis(scan things), biology(scan things?), Catalog(collect knowledge), Diagnostics(diagnose and fix things like robots), Archaeology (track artifacts), botany(scan flowers?), chemistry(scan inanimate things?), field study(probably going to have combat)
- You will see an icon showing what you should scan such as the loftite crystals
- Not all enemies can be scanned.  An icon will show which can.

**Settler Path**    

- Meant for socializers and also ""builders""
- Tasks include mending broken or degraded equipment such as a farmer's fence which, due to the breakage, is letting all his cows escape.  Such tasks are separate from questing.  This is internally called ""minfrastructure""
- True infrastructure tasks include building a new shop, new vendor or a bus station.
- Smaller ""projects"" helps gather resources for bigger ""projects""
- Can unlock Settler powers that allow you to ""free-farm anywhere""
- There are goals when building -- raise a town's value or utilize your abilities
- Increasing value to a certain extent allows special things to happen like bigger rewards
- Bigger, more meaningful projects will take multiple settlers to complete while smaller projects can be done solo
- If structures aren't maintained, they will decay
- You can get a lot of path XP by running around and building everything by yourself but less from social tools like campfires
- *almost* everything Settlers do is unphased
- Settlers have utility in dungeons such as being able to make a resurrection station next to a boss -- can use resources that can be found in the dungeon.  Random chance whether many of these resources will appear
- Settlers will be useful when placing structures next to harder areas in the world
- While there are static locations that can be built on, there are also free form structures you can freely place
- Settlers will get more housing equipment(FABKits) than other paths 
- Housing dungeons mentioned explicitly after being asked the question ""What sort of perks will Settlers bring to player housing?"" I would not bet on housing dungeons being exclusive to Settlers, however.
- Settlers get increased XP the more their structures are built (campfire, for example)
- Speculation: in a video segment about settlers, a player is seen swinging a sword to cut down trees
- Can build quest givers with really good loot
- Video demonstrated the building of a jail which opened up quests for the area and had a warden that could give players a buff
- Can build taxi vendors to allow rapid travel through area 
- Can make outposts with guards in an area to help you fight mobs (not just in towns)
- There is somewhat of a meta where you have to decide where to place structures to get optimal use.  For example build an outpost in the wilderness and choose to put your campfire there.  You can put structures like a campfire in major areas, but then you are competing with everyone else doing that.  We can expect that if there are two fires placed immediately on/next to each other, only one settler is going to get credit for a player standing within reach of both fires.
- Mission types: Expansion(improving towns), Supply cache, Public ServiceTasks for the greater good), Civil Defense(combat, I think), Infrastructure (builds hospitals, taverns, spaceports, etc)
- Can make puzzles appear

**Explorer Path**    

- Will see time challenges going from point A to point B
- Will discover underground passages
- Implies exploring won't be largely flipping back and forth on a map to find a spot.  The explorer dev's quote is ""maps? who needs'em?""
- Mission types: Cartography(chart unexplored territory), Expedition(chart unexplored territory?), Scavenger Hunt, Surveillance, Exploration(problem solving to find hidden locations), Operations(think combat, maybe), Staking Claim, Tracking(track enemies)

**Soldier Path**    

- Will have a horde-mode style gameplay
- Summons big-ole bosses
- Mission types: Assassination, Hostage Rescue, Conquer(i.e. Horde), First Strike(assault), Demolition, SWAT(test new weapons), Security(item defense), Protect(horde w/ defending allies)

**Paths General**    

- Will be intended benefits to having players with multiple different paths interact.  They call it ""crossing paths""
- It also seems as if you will get bonuses for simply helping another player out with their path, whether you contribute with your own path or not (speculation)
- You can skip path content and path quests
- You get special abilities, costumes, loot and cash
- Standard, non-path specific content, will have you doing various path activities.  i.e. a soldier will likely build something, a scientist will kill, an explorer will scan and a settler will roam


**The World**    

- Very little phasing -- Carbine wants you to feel like your activities are impacting the world, phasing hurts that.
- Towns have values.  This includes an economy, quality of life and security.  The better the town, the more there is to gain from them (quests, etc).  The town value seems to have a lot to do with settler activity.
- There are areas of the world intentionally made more difficult than others
- Artsy, but there is depth -- the grass and bushes sway for example.  Small detail, but really looks good.
- A fly-over shows that zones have significantly different appearances.  Someone mentioned how WoW has fairly distinctive zones.  Yea, WS has that totally covered.  Very neat
- Models such as trees aren't all identical, there is deformation and variety added so it doesn't look like a giant copy+paste fest
- Looks like roads are fairly clear -- I suspect you could traverse the shown zones end-to-end without fighting by staying on the roads.  I'm sure this is subject to change, but so many MMOs have mobs aggro to the roads.
- Enemies are close together so you will frequently aggro additional mobs when fighting one.
- You can gain reputation with multiple different factions doing different activities such as repairs, killing, etc

**Housing**    

- There is a strong possibility of having ""housing dungeons"" at launch -- 8 are developed so far, but no promises.
- A garden, planted to get crafting mats, may spawn rare blooms or even a creature that tries to kill you
- Will be ""rare seeds"" you can plant

**War Plots**    

- Warplots exist, primarily, in the air like houses
- Warplots are big chunks of land where you and your buddies can build a fortress
- The Warplots can be landed on the ground to fight other Warplots
- You can capture raid bosses, bring it back to your warplot
- Captured raid bosses can be sent into an enemy's Warplot
- You can make Mech factories that will allow you to pilot a mech with super powers
- The idea is *destructible fortress vs destructible fortress*
- Up to 40v40 destructible fortress PvP

**Character Advancement**

- Stats (brutality, moxie, etc) that unlock *things* such as increased critical hit chance, ""special powers that unlock talent-ish things"", or cause effects such as when you kill a monster it drops a ""healing glob""
- Stat unlocks are intended to help you ""change how you play your character"" rather than just marginal stat increases for min/maxes
- Talent trees are not currently used, but Carbine is not ruling them out in the future
- Acheivements done in the Elder Game can unlock skills and perks(?!)
- Character race and path can determine difficulty of earning unlocks (Granoks have easier time with strength unlocks)
- You ""won't cripple yourself by making the wrong decision, but certain acheivements may be easier"" when regarding early player choice (race, path) and its effect on unlocks

**Gear**    

- Carbine doesn't like a lot of people standing around with the same gear on in endgame
- Carbine thinks the greatest differentiation should be at the high level
- Randomized elements on equipment
- Customized gear
- ""Points"" that unlock powers to make you different than the guy next to you
- COSTUMES mentioned

**Tradeskills**    

- Not on the reveal schedule yet
- Do NOT want to have you ""click a node and watch a bar fill up""
- Lots of ""interesting base metals"" in the game such as Explodium which explodes when you hit it
- Hitting a rock can uncover that it is attached to an enemy which you then have to chase and knock materials off it
- A node may be a creature made from the material who then swallows you and you have to knock through the creature's stomach to escape
- Farming mats should have ""variance"" and not be boring
- Their system intends to combat bot farmers
- Crafting should be more acheivement-type advancement, rather than crafting a bunch of random items
- Player-planted gardens have a RNG effect where they can spawn enemies, rare blooms, etc


**Combat**    

- Environmental effects can damage players and enemies such as Explodium nodes
- Player is shown swimming and underwater fights are mentioned
- As a noob you will be trying to dodge enemy abilities.  Later on you (the player, not the char) learn to exploit the enemy and environment, like how they turn against a villain in horror movies.
- Looks like at least some channeled abilities can be cancelled out of early to dodge
- When dead you can res in your current spot for a sizable chunk of money (14.7silver out of the player's 1.2gold in the demo) with a 30 minute cooldown or you can rez free at the ""nearest Holo-Crypt""
- There is, at the moment, a global cooldown

**End Game**    

- They feel end-game is the most important to WS's success
- Currently 50-70% of the team is dedicated to elder content
- Elder content needs to be replayable
- Want content to be hard
- Want content to be something ""you look forward to""

**Raids**    

- ""We wanted to make raiding something that more people can compete in"" -- their words, not mine :)
- World firsts are awesome for the 1% of the 1%
- Randomness of raids is to make it more engaging for the non 1% of the 1%
- Randomness includes putting down a health-increasing spot that pops up or having extra AoE damage that spreads in various patterns
- Want ""fastest raid time"" to be a goal, moreso than ""first raid clear of the week""
- Want to add more goals -- ""Fable-like"" challenges such as defeating bosses without armor
- Monsters are going to have different phases (don't think this surprises anyone)

**Dungeons**    

- Even 5-mans set to be hard
- Dungeons are looking great, large, detailed, varied and interesting.

**Vehicles**    

- A player is piloting a large mech.  Looks fluid
- A player is shown shooting ground targeted missiles while riding the motorcycle

**Quests**    

- Dynamic quests -- pop up while doing other things in the zone (thinking like SWTOR).  A lot of time based challenges, it seems.  Some skill based.
- Spin-the-wheel loot system: after finishing the dynamic quest, the player saw a window with three different loot items.  The player clicks one of the three items.  The loot items cycled being highlighted until the highlighting finally stopped on the one item the player will receive.  If the player receives the item he had initially clicked on, he receives a boost in addition to the loot.  Essentially a box of three items will appear and a RNG will determine which you get. 
- If you hover over a quests it will display an arrow on your screen, directing you where to go


**Game**    

- Implied it costs ~$100 million
- While not a focus, we saw a lot of variety in appearances in the NPCs suggesting a promising character creation system
- List of ""Events"" in the bottom right...  perhaps large map events like in GW2?
- Currently 200+ hours of solo(able) content
- Walk-throughs are bad, strategy guides are good
- Payment model is a HYBRID MODEL.  The most common hybrid model from NCSoft seems to be an F2P with an optional subscription.  This doesn't rule out a B2P(GW2-style) system.  Either way most can rest easier knowing this reduces the likelihood of strong advantages for paying customers.

1) The forums fill with the ""are they out yet"" invite threads

2) The forums information content dives significantly (leaving only point 1), because those that are in beta cannot speak about beta, and thus their contribution to the forums in theories, ideas, etc pretty much cease

3) the developer website/communication ""big news"" is beta has started!  Well congratulations on the milestone, but for the majority that did not get in that doesn't mean a lot in terms of interest.

I know the prospect of getting into beta is a big thing, but it is such a lottery that for flow of information stifles for the non-beta community.

My suggestion would be for Carbine to start cranking out some tangible items they can show us.  Screen shots of things they have disclosed, maybe a sneak-peek/teasers of the races/classes not yet to be revealed, maybe a shot of a raid boss for us to drool and theorize over.  Maybe a rumor-control blog, something to really keep people coming back to see what is up next!

&gt;Hello Jeremy! :)

&gt;My question is:

&gt;Can someone who hasn't recieved/completed the PreBeta survey back at february participate in the coming beta test two or stess test?

&gt;**JG:  Yep**

&gt;If so, will there be an another wave of surveys before Beta 3?

 

&gt;**JG:  Yep.  Troy's doublechecking this though, to make sure - so I might edit this.**

&gt;At launch or post lunch, will there be a spectator mode to watch the epic 40 vs 40 Warplot  matches?  

&gt;**JG:  currently on the post-launch plans, but plans do change - so no promises one way or the other.  Half the team is addicted to LoL so e-sports is a thang for us, but we do want to ship in our lifetimes.**

&gt;HEY! Super excited about Wildstar! 

&gt;WILL I be able to pilot a space ship? (However big or small.) I've seen them docked in the yard, for instance, in the Housing Dev! :D

&gt;What will your guild system be like? (I'm coming primarily from a WoW background, so I'll be comparing. ;D)

&gt;Do you have any need for a personal assistant/human slave?

&gt;**Space ships:  Actually we built the whole world intending for flight from day 1.  But there's a bit of a backlash in the community right now around flight trivializing content/making the world too small.  So we're listening to those debates right now, if I can be honest.  Back when I/we launched City of Heroes flight was  a big deal, so it's interesting to me now to hear the backlash.   Opinions welcome.**

&gt;**We do guilds, haven't announced a ton of the different stuff in 'em yet.  We also do circles which are guilds-lite, allowing you to more casually bond with numbers of different friends with different interests.**

&gt;There's rumors that classes can only wield one weapon type (As in warriors can only wield two-handed swords, spellslingers can only wield guns etc). Is this true?

&gt;Thanks :)

&gt;**In general you get a weapon type per class, with some exceptions - like Warhammer did back in the day.  Why?  Lets us do unique animations per class/attack and have more visual oomph in combat, and makes class silhouettes unique.  Tradeoffs are making sure there's enough variety in your weapons and making sure more than 1/7 of the weapon drops are useful to you (that's on us to make sure we do a good job around that)**

&gt;Aside from the milestones, do attributes that are not primary/secondary for your class provide any other benefits? For example, do stalkers get assault power from brutality?

&gt;**Here's a quick version:  Each attribute for each class has milestones.  Some big, some small (interally we call 'em ""lollipops"" and ""jawbreakers"" but that's because we're borderline unfit for interaction with the real world.  We'll call em something else publicly)**

&gt;**As you raise each of your stats, every point gives you some secondary stat or two (so each point of Brutality is slightly useful).** 

&gt;**Lollipops are interim milestones giving you a noticeable chunk of a secondary stat (sometimes the same as the primary, sometimes not).**

&gt;**Jawbreakers give you big gamechangers of abilities (enough Brutality and slain enemies pop and leave health globes behind, or whatever -  check the patch notes for tons of em).**

&gt;**There's a whole design theory behind how that works, if you see me on a forum later remind me and I'll give a little soliloquy on the subject (unless it's obvious from the above).**

&gt;**As soon as we have fun, varied leveling content up to cap and solid elder games around each major playstyle, is the honest answer.  We'd like that to fall in 2013 but honestly getting it right is more important than hitting a date; you only get to launch once and the mentality of ""launch a patcher and then fill in the game"" has killed more MMOs than any other disease.**

&gt;Can you give any information on how you going to cater to solo players at Eldergame?

&gt;**Sure:  Short form is we're aiming for at least one big dynamic area chock full of PQs and other solo/semi-solo content, regular new consumable content advancing the world story (approximately once a month but if we're cool like the GW2 guys we'll speed it up even more), deep housing stuff (some revealed some not), and more.  Around the end of the summer we'll lift the veil on a lot of the elder game plans in detail so that it's not hand-wavey answers.**

&gt;Simple question: Can you have numbers in your name? What about special characters like spaces or dashes.

&gt;This is important to me for... reasons.
 
&gt;(Serious question btw :D :D :D).

&gt;**At the moment there are numbers allowed in the names, not special characters.  There's some debate on our beta forums from RPers about whether it's better to have them so that Mechari can have more robotic-style names or remove em so l33td3wd doesn't exist, so opinions welcome.**

&gt;Greetings: Seeing some of the early beta footage from PAX, I've noticed there's a limited skill-bar with maybe 8 skills. An attraction to some other MMORPGs is that there is a variety of ways to play your character using a lot of skills (extra skillbars, many abilities...). Is Wildstar keeping its current ability limit of 8, will it increase, and what are the development decisions behind this?  

&gt;**Yeah, that caused a mild kerfluffle in the CBT1 Patch notes.  Here's the intent:**

&gt;**The limited bar mentioned there is actually class skills, not path skills, temp skills, mount skills, class specials, etc.   We reduced the number of abilities IIR in those notes to add more Path skills (but my brain is fallible)**

&gt;**Our goal is to support as many abilities in the LAS as a skilled player can use without custom hardware (30-button mouses etc).  It turns out that while dodging, facing, strafing, moving, jumping, etc. we were finding super low numbers of folks using even the upper ends of the bar.**

&gt;**So...will it change?  Probably, we need a ton more testers in and specifically we need high end raiders in saying when it's enough and not too much, and we need to gather data.  So I don't know which way it'll change (history dictates probably allowing more abiltiies to be used, either through unlocking via the elder advancement system or otherwise so people can tune the way they want to play, but data and feedback will drive us (as through most things).**

&gt;Hello Mr. Gaffney,

&gt;My question is more on the business side of Wildstar's development and Carbine Studio's creation.  It has been repeated multiple times that many of the developers that worked on Wildstar were former Blizzard developers.  And there has been comparisons made between Wildstar and WoW.  As somebody who greatly enjoyed WoW for many years, I'm not disappointed what so ever by this.

&gt;I would like to know who came up with the idea to start Carbine Studios. Additionally,  who had the vision and led the charge of getting Wildstar developed?

&gt;Second question: So many games seem to release unfinished products, with the idea that they can patch them up in the months to come.  However, you guys have stated that you will release Wildstar when its done.  This is GREAT news for us gamers.  I would like to know what sets you guys apart to give you the freedom to release a product when you feel its done, as opposed to games like Warhammer Online and SWTOR which were launched with a myriad of issues.

&gt;It feels like, with other games, their management (or publisher) dictates when a game is to be launched while with you guys, it seems like the developers have the final say.

&gt;Thanks!


&gt;**The team was originally formed of about 20 seniors and leads off of the World of Warcraft team - but since then (we're now many years later and more like 220 people and growing) we have folks from EQ1/2, CoH,  Dark Age, WAR, and probably most of the other western MMOs big and small.  And a good crop of noobs on their first MMO too (new blood is good too).**

&gt;**I was the executive (VP Product Development) on the NCsoft side who signed the team initially (with Robert Garriott, Richard's brother).  I actually retired for a year and they gave me a call because they needed exec help and design help and I have a background in both.  One of the bennies of being a VP/PD of a big company is that you know pretty much all the games in development (little games want funding, and we're a cash-rich company, and big games want to go to Korea with a major partner) and honestly this was just the coolest project in the industry in my mind, so I joined here fulltime 4-5 years back or so.**

&gt;**Anyhoo I'm as senior as it gets in Carbine.  Within NCsoft I report to our CEO and our Global CEO and they are both gamers, so making sure the game gets backed by NCsoft is a matter of making sure it's actually fun and have 'em play.  Sounds simple but it works, sometimes it's really that easy, even in a megacorp.**

&gt;Will PvE in Wildstar be a never-ending arms race to get the latest wave of shiny gear before it is obsoleted with a patch, or will there be alternatives? How raid-centric is the game? I'm quite excited for it but I have little desire to go through raiding hell again a la WoW.

&gt;Similarly, will PvP also be a gear arms race or will the game be taking more of a GW2 approach in keeping things more balanced?

&gt;**We've put some spin on the standard loot-grind cycle by allowing you to invest in gear over time as well as outright replace it, and having a number of different non-loot advancement cycles both during levelling and elder games (path XP, crafting levelling (a brand new system), housing advancement (fairly deep, lots of investment is tied there), warplot advancement, and probably others I'm forgetting).**

&gt;**So I don't promise that there's no gearing up, but we do spread the advancement across a number of areas to hopefully reward players for playing how they want to play as well as just farming phat lootz. You'll play at some point and tell us how well we did or not.**

We'll try to do some mini-arkships at least alongside whichever shows we attend.**

&gt;I'd like to comment on the flying mount controversy if you don't mind.

&gt;I think a lot of the people bashing flying mounts are coming from WoW where they really did and continue to have a terrible impact on the world. WoW is fundamentally played on a 2D surface and while you move through 3 space going over a hill it's still just a curved surface. When flying mounts were introduced suddenly the entire game was tied to a surface, but players were able to leave that surface and totally circumvent the game world while also allowing the fastest form of 

&gt;&lt;clippy clippy for space&gt;

&gt;**Other alternatives include limited flight (via a gas tank on your speederplane or w/e), mounts unlocked per zone (so that you can be a badass once you've unlocked the main quests, but that might feel too game-y) and more - we actually have a meeting later today to bounce the latest alternatives off of each other.**

I propose a trade. In order to have a trade both parties must have something that the other party wants. What I want from you is pretty simple, no it isn't a Beta invite, my invite will come when it comes. What I want is a new female Draken screenshot or two. It has been well over a month since anything new on the female Draken has been revealed and all of the images that we the community have of this enigmatic race / gender combo are the two copy-paste NPC models in Deradune. Since the Draken are an already revealed playable race and we have a couple of different revealed zones (Crimson Isle, Deradune, Halon Ring) where they could be spotted it does not seem too unreasonable a request (I hope). 

So what do I have that you might want in exchange for a screenshot or two? Well... I have recently gotten involved with the community at Wildstar Central and have begun cranking out some fan-art, specifically comics. I think that  you may like the work that I am doing and would be willing to trade. 

My funny little Draken comics (with further editions in the works) for a measly screenshot or two of some female Draken that we the community at large have not seen already.

And dammit it does look good! But despite that, we all must have some concerns for the game, be it major or minor. It's easy to get lost in the hype, but pretty hard to dig down and figure out what you may generally be concerned about in terms of the game. And honestly, voicing that concern is perhaps the biggest thing you can do to help the devs.

* For me, I'm concerned about the progression system. I really, really desperately want their to be a wide variety of builds, not just cookie cutter fruit of the month stuff. At the very least, I'd like 10+ ""Cookie cutter"" specs to choose from that are all roughly equally viable. Ultimately, jumping between builds is perhaps the most fun I have in RPGs.

* I'm also a bit apprehensive about 40 man raid content. I think it'll be fun and challenging, but the logistics of getting 40 people attuned, decked out in gear, and online at one time is daunting, and as someone that likes to progress through content in his own guild, I'm a bit scared by it. 

* Not knowing the payment model is a bit scary, I really don't want the game to be free to play. Free to play games, universally, have much worse online communities then any other games. When you have a pay wall, people act a bit differently, but if it's free and people can just hop on another account, and don't have repercussions for being a huge dick(League anyone?).

* Another thing that worries me is community. Back in ever quest, it was absolutely mandatory to have a list of friends or a guild to back you up and go out there and quest. Soloing wasn't exactly easy, especially not for leveling in the original EQ. It encouraged people to talk to one another. 

* I've played guild wars 2, and I try and talk to literally every person that I see doing the same dynamic event as me. Maybe 1 in 10 people respond, and 1 in 20 respond with something of substance. People just don't want to be social in MMOs any more outside of guilds.

* I worry that the dynamic group content may play out the same way in Wildstar.

There may be some missed info, as the hour long interview was PACKED with tons of questions and good new info. So here it is:


**Warplots** - Grey/white mode, not available to public, tested by Devs, 40v40, can capture downed raid bosses and pit against enemies.

**Mentoring** - Very very geared to social interction. Mentored player will only be slightly weeker than the Mentor. Rewards for helping lower levels. The option for power-running is there, but at much lower reward.

**Settlers** buffing quest hubs and setting up some outposts in vunerable areas for ""kicking ass and taking names"" TONS of real environment interaction.

**Friends and family testing** - ~500 people
Closed beta is focused more on PVP, as there is a large playerbase.

**Flying mounts?**- He likes them, A lot of people are against them for trivializing content like exploring and pvp (easy escapes). Less social interaciton when you can fly off to the middle of nowhere. Easy to impliment, as the devs use them, but unsure if they will release to closed beta.

**CBT2** - 2000 more people on top of the original..
Stress test - ~15000 people will get keys. Not focused on hyping game. All stress testers get beta accesss ASAP. CBT3 or Stress test 2 will happen in 5+ weeks. Intend for players to have a full community running (guilds, mail, Auctionhouse, friends list) 

**Currently ~300k beta keys have been uniquely logged on**

**Housing** - Currently jumping back and forth between instanced or not. Possibly trying to slot housing and warplots into the world environment, as they have the technology. No commitment to a choice on instanced or world environment housing. Neighborhoods possible, lots of flaws.

**Scientist** - ""Human OCD type stuff"" Searching, Lore development, and achievement type things. Information on where you are fighting. ex. Finding an area, and learning why the fights are taking place through a series of quests, where as a soldier would walk in, trip a trap, and get into fight content.

**Paths** - Effect types of quest you get. 70% of zone content is for everybody. 25-30% is based strictly on your path, and will definately effect future content and lore paths.

**Payment Models** - Based strongly off what has worked best. They have a large focus on what does work for us gamers, but still need to look at it as what it is, a business.

**Servers** - Beta data center in Dallas, one being set in frankfurt. Euro can play on NA server currently, but they are looking to cater to the overseas as WoW did.

**Telegraphs within raids** - Focused on the interaction with your own telegraphs overlapping the rest of your party, and the large monsters putting another telegraph down to mess all your plans up. No set synchonization in encounters like Warcraft, keeping content fresh. Strategy based instead of walk-through based.

**Weekly/monthly rewards for server best's in PVE. No mention of PVP, but I can only assume it will follow through.**

Deep character customization guarenteed, as well as gear.

**E-sports* *  Spectator will help make it a bit more entertaining, but they want to be the top MMO, not the top E-sport

**Roleplayers** - Paths and housing try to help tell a story about who you are as a player. Looking for more sandbox type play for people who are interested in more social interaction. Can throw parties or host events in your house.

**World PVP** - CBT3 Will have world PVP. Eldergame looking more towards warplots. No ""capture this for your faction"" like hellfire towers in WoW.

Australian servers possible, as lag on Beta is HUGE

**Crafting** - Lots of info to come, Huge reveal to come. Different type of advancement, not MAKE X OF Y, then MAKE C of Z. Jeremy wants to have a single big reveal.

**Economy**- Central access points for auctionhouse and other econ. resources. AH plans to stay single server, but they have technology to cross if they choose to. Big plans for AH to be the center of the community.

**/emotes** - TONS of them, ""Sorry nerds, no brothels""

**Raid attunements** - Developers are PRO-Attunement, caters to harder-core players. If they become tedious, they will relieve them.

**Housing is planned to be functional. Decorations are going to be vast, currently 2000+ different decorations.**

**Housing Dungeons**  - Items found outside in PVE content can be brought home to unlock certain peices of a ""puzzle"", which when completed will unlock instanced content in your house which you and your friends can explore. ex. ""You killed the king of the goblins in a long quest chain. All the pieces you gathered and brought home open a dungeon where you get to loot their camps for a week""( used by jeremy live)

**Guilds*  * - Logos, Titles, Not much revealed, lots of guild development. Lots to come.

**Circle System** - Groups of like-interest people. Can be in multiple circles, can choose circle names, like a Lite-guilde

I hope this can inform atleast one person. The gamefaqs board is way to quiet for me.

Nothing in GW2 felt really worthwhile and thereby it didn't make me feel invested in it. (funny how GW1 did this perfectly, hence my expectations)

All these problems came actually from little details to make the game appeal more to the more causal / actionRPG market. For me it felt just like that, an Action (CO-OP) online LIGHT-RPG that just focussed on ACTION, EPIC ACTION and MORE EPIC ACTION. 

Now the direction of WildStar seems to be less casual and more of a mix between GW2 and vanilla-WoW. So on paper it seems better. But still im affraid that once it launches possible little details about the implementation of creative ideas backfire. My biggest fear is the idea to try to please as many people as possible that in the end make the game lack depth. 

Anyone else has insights in possible problems with WildStar or maybe how it will avoid certain problems that recent big MMO's had?",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,,True,t3_1fpm5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1fpm5s/scared_to_get_too_excited_and_be_dissapointed/,

I've lurked around here for a bit, decided to make this my first post. After hearing about WildStar a couple months ago, I was very intrigued. I know it's generally a bad idea to be over-invested in a game before it even launches, or hype it up too much, but I just can't help it! 

I made the following playlists in order to get my friends excited about the game, and hopefully join me in Nexus. I tried to be quite purposeful in making them, and I thought it might help some of you who wanted to get your friends involved as well. Here you go:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-NXdWk9sm8&amp;list=PLviDJTEAoZAy6EErNSUfx8DoCz9BccyJm

First playlist aimed at introducing people to WildStar. Little to no gameplay, just showing the humor, story, atmosphere, et cetera. All the videos are official WildStar cinematics.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJkfhxLEhEU&amp;list=PLviDJTEAoZAwJup5-F7GmWu0lp12fjdax

Second playlist, to show people the game itself. Simply consists of the 4 DevSpeak videos and an additional video about telegraphs, narrated by Jeremy Gaffney, that is very similar to DevSpeak.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvqTyIeFXI8&amp;list=PLviDJTEAoZAzYALomJ0L4BlAqvjhapZKz

Third playlist, for the people that ate up the first 2 and crave some juicy WildStar content. These videos all provide detailed insight into the minds of the developers and WildStar itself. All are quite long, but very much worth watching if you just can't get enough WildStar.

I know these are very simple playlists, but I wasn't trying to create an all-encompassing compendium, just something to get my friends as hyped as I am (not possible, I'm the conductor of the hype-train, choo choo) about WildStar. There are TONS of great videos on youtube with extensive gameplay, and a lot of podcasts/commentary by various communities/people. Just check youtube! Bonus playlist of a few community-commentaries that I enjoyed (subjective/random, not a playlist I made to show friends):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uucztCk4jEI&amp;list=PLviDJTEAoZAzdhXQyONEOed6QAI-2UfWb

1369346144.0,50,self.WildStar,1exjke,"There more I think about it, the more I want Wildstar to be subscription-based.",LJJ1991,92,42,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1exjke/there_more_i_think_about_it_the_more_i_want/,"I've been thinking on this subject for a while now. In fact, it may be one thing I am most curious about regarding Wildstar. Originally, I had preferred a B2P system similar to GW2. I had this preference for two reasons:

1.) Carbine/NCSoft have a serious opporunity to make a lot of money by combining Housing and microtransactions (and I have a **very slight** suspicion that, even with a sub-model, there will still be aesthetic microtransactions). This has the potential to be even more successfull (monetarily) than GW2's system.

2.) No **popular and successful** game has been strictly subscription-based aside from EVE and WoW (at least that I've heard of, I know there are a few others and I even plan on trying FFXIV:ARR). 

That being said, there was a process of game-playing that lead me to my current P2P preference:

At open-beta launch, I tried Neverwinter out. I bought the Founders pack or whatever and I enjoyed the game for about a week. The Foundry was awesome (until the exploits), the combat was fun, and the game seemed big (even though the game world and content is really quite small). 

After two-three weeks, I discovered just how P2W the cash shop was. It isn't as bad as some games, but they very deceptively created a fairly P2W system under the guise of the seemingly fair Diamond currency. 

This wasn't what got me about the game, though. It was the community. It wasn't particularly bad, but the game was full of spammers, trolls, and people who simply didn't know what they were doing while acting like they did. I mostly quit because I didn't feel there was a real community (this will probably improve overtime in Neverwinter, but right now, it's not good). By the way, I'm not saying Neverwinter is a bad MMO, I'm saying it has problems. Neverwinter is an average MMO. That was the first step to me discovering my desire for the P2P model in Wildstar.

Then I went back to GW2 for about a week. I haven't played since around January, so a lot had changed, but wow... It was dead. Not dead in the sense that ArenaNet is going out of business, no. Dead in the sense that there was NOBODY around! Maybe it was just my server (and I was on a HUGE server in January), but there were so little people, even in Lion's Arch. There were still a good amount of people at the huge dynamic events, but not nearly as many as I remember. 

Now, this has little to do with ArenaNet's business model and more to do with the fact that the endgame doesn't have much to it, but the game bored me in a week. I even decided to start a new character after seeing the dead Lion's Arch and it bored me in a week. And, of course, WvWvW was pointless to join because nothing had really changed and structured PvP was just as... nothing as it had ever been. There was nothing to do! 

Regardless, the community was never bad to me in GW2, it just doesn't exist anymore mostly because of boring content. However, the gem store is still, apparently, successful because what they did with it was excellent (and if Wildstar has a Protostar shop, they need to do something similar). 

Finally, about two weeks ago, I went back to WoW. I literally played it for a week because I got bored, but I noticed something. WoW is still a high quality game. The community is still booming. Everything is available to everyone. Everyone has to work to progress (if you want to call raid finder and whatever work). Yet, I got bored really fast. Why? The leveling is pointless (as it has been since Cata) and everything is streamlined. It's basically impossible to enjoy the leveling content at its intended level unless you're doing the Iron Man Challenge (which now that I mention it, sounds like fun). My point is, the only purpose of the game is end game! I get that, and all, but it felt empty (it has never felt empty for me before).

Then I had a thought. What if there was a game with quality endgame that doesn't streamline the leveling process, doesn't restrict content based on money, and doesn't have a cash shop (unless it is SOLELY for aesthetics without any conveniences even)? 

And then I realized that would probably be what Wildstar will look like if it is subscription-based. At that point, my opinion changed from preferring B2P and being okay with P2P (while not wanting F2P at all) to preferring P2P while being okay with B2P (and still not wanting F2P at all). And that's the end of this long, pointless rant...

1368866838.0,46,self.WildStar,1ekhz6,How about gliding?,kuroioni,54,8,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1ekhz6/how_about_gliding/,"In the 'flying or no flying' dispute there seems to be considerably little said about the third option available, which (to me) is also the very best solution to this whole dilemma. 

What I mean is, obviously, **gliding**.

For those of you who don't really know what that means, here are two examples:

* [gliding in Aion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcl0jR1Pml8)

* [gliding in Archeage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTTyNArxCRM)

Basically, you get *a tool* (be it [wings](http://files1.guildlaunch.net/guild/library/gallery/82295/sell_39956Mid.jpg), or a [retractable glider](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/307300_531158173571654_1588012964_n.jpg) or [whatever](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/4600000/Dumbo-classic-disney-4613973-1280-960.jpg)) that allows you to glide through the air, while being subject to forces such as gravity (you cannot glide indefinitely), wind currents (makes you turn, glide faster or slower) or hot air pockets (gaining and losing altitude). You can also 'dismount' in mid-air and fall (cover a large vertical distance considerably faster than by other means), saving yourself in the last moment by re-entering the gliding state (if a cooldown allows).

What's not to love, eh? :D

Advantages of such a system are many:

* not only does it allow for uninterrupted exploring, but actively helps and even adds to it;

* doesn't trivialize the content/environment;

* on the contrary to above point - it allows for new and exciting ways of moving through the land;

* allows for fun pvp scenarios;

* social 'games' (finding exciting places to glide over, racing etc.);

* if done properly (as a game mechanic) will be reliant on the player's skill (the better you utilize the technique the farther/faster you can get, escape or chase).

The most apparent disadvantage, on the other hand, would be the inability to stay in the air indefinitely I guess. But then again, I believe this is the main argument against flying in the first place? 

Other than that, there would obviously be a limit to where and how far you can go (especially on more levelled terrain). 


To round this up: for me, gliding really looks like the best of both worlds, while also having very few disadvantages. It both adds a new layer of depth to the game world and doesn't trivialize the content for all the explorers (au contraire - it can be a very useful tool). If introduced as a thought-through game mechanic (rather than a simple gimmick), players will be able to learn and master it, transforming a simple act into a joyous activity.

Today I launched [wildstar.guildex.org](http://wildstar.guildex.org), which is part of an expanded version of GW2Guilds.org (Guildex).

In the run up to GW2's launch there were several different attempts made to list which servers guilds were rolling on, but eventually they all became out of date and contradicted each other, so I built GW2Guilds.org to use as a central database. It proved to be very successful, with around 2,000 guilds registered before launch, and now has over 8,000 guilds registered.

The keyword is probably simplicity. It's not a social network site or any kind of organisational tool, it's just a searchable database of guilds that allows searching based on a wide range of criteria.

If you had an account on GW2Guilds.org you'll be able to use that to log in to the new site, and you can also use the existing GW2 guild entries and expand them to include WildStar.

Feedback is more than welcome.

* allows us to put up manikins in our house and then deck them in in-game armor. Allow us to pose the manikins. I think this would be awesome to document the progression of our characters. and It would also make that loot we spent so long getting worthwhile after we find better gear.

Why does an established guild (one that probably has it's own website) require it's own subreddit with 25 subscribers. It's easy enough to accomplish, so it's a defunct rule; but it's also a ridiculous one aimed at keeping Ex Inferno the only current featured guild.

I submitted our guild, Genesis Gaming; as well as a guild we're friendly with also applied and met both requirements (it was previously 10) but instead of an aknowledgment, a response, telling us no, or any reply at all for that matter; we got silence and the rules and requirements upped to 25.

This and the fact that more mods have been added seemingly randomly without announcement (I might have missed this but it's not in the side bar or been on the front page last I've seen)

The idea is basically a zone with some kind of extreme environmental biosphere, it could be heavy snow or toxic, or just a lack of atmosphere which would limit visibility / movement or survivability, it could be huge and sparse but most importantly procedural generated. Within this zone as a result of the threatening atmosphere condition in order to traverse you would  need some kind of consumable, like a gas mask filter or a thermal battery fueled generator which you acquired outside of the zone through random drops, crafting or just buying them outright.

Some options which you could include:

-  Gathering nodes in which you could find higher quality materials, or greater quantity of common consumables or a special unique material which is used to craft a super cool / rare item of such, not necessarily an item with stats.

- Rare spawning mobs which drop super rare mounts, the spawning mobs could change colour or have different features (two horns or bigger fangs).

- Levels of atmosphere stability, during certain hours the atmosphere would get really intense requiring more usage of the consumable however even greater potential for amazing items / achievements.

- PvP would always be enabled throughout the zone and killing players within the zone would award you with a greater amount or different currency used to purchase cool aesthetic changes / titles (such as bandit [Name])

- Different conditions during different weeks, one week could be toxic, one week desert, one week snow, requiring different consumables and rewarding different things.

There are hundreds of possibilities you could add and it would not require much work to code and keep constantly changing / adding things as long as you sort the random generated stuff out. The zone could change every 24 hours or every 48, or even every raid reset (weekly) this would encourage hardcore players as they will get to explore more of it and give them something else to do on a weekly basis other than sit around waiting to raid.

Edit - just another expansion from the comments and myself regarding paths - paths could be used to great affect within the zone, settlers could make air purifiers and get a share of the gold / xp when people use it, while scientists could find out lore about why the zone is around, even have a tool to PREDICT the next condition or make consumable more efficient, explorers could be able to map out the current zone, and then sell maps of the zone to others, obviously being able to do this every time it changes, the possibilities really would be endless, and awesome.

What do you guys think?

Here's a compilation of the important bits and my take on the pros and cons of each.  

**40 and 20 person raids**  

Giant groups of people taking on equally giant bosses.  A throwback to vanilla WoW or Everquest raiding where every boss required a large numbers of players to defeat.  

Good:
&gt;Epic feel - More people make even dull fights feel epic.  
&gt;Nostalgia - Feels like raiding in 2006, which some folks claim they want.  
&gt;Get carried - Large raids allow for more room for error, placing less emphasis on individual skill and more on group organization.  

Bad:
&gt;Herding cats - Hardest part of a large raid is organizing one.  
&gt;Low individual recognition - Everyone is a face in the crowd with few unique roles or responsibilities.  
&gt;Simple mechanics - With very few exceptions, large raid fights were difficult due to tuning, not mechanical complexity.  
&gt;Less popular - WoW 25man raiding has nearly died while 10mans have become significantly more popular.  
  
  
**Attunements**  

Individual or group preparation to access raid content.  Another throwback to early WoW and Everquest, requiring players to undergo unique quests, grinding, or clearing older content to participate in the newest raids.  

Good: 
&gt;Feeling of accomplishment - You earned your way into the raid. Go you!  
&gt;Proof of ability - If challenging enough the attunement weeds out low-skill players.  
&gt;Storytelling opportunity - Attunements provide the opportunity to show players why the raid is important.  

Bad:
&gt;Catch-up is a hassle - Having to redo attunements anytime you bring a new raider gets old, fast.  
&gt;Inconvenient - Logically, attunements make it harder to get people into raiding, even if they are capable and geared.  Gaming is supposed to be fun, not work.  


**Extremely difficult**  

Again, another throwback to old school MMO raiding, where only a small portion of the playerbase is expected to raid. The claim is that raiding has become too accessible, taking away the mystery of the content and pride that goes with entering a raid and killing bosses.  

Quote: (Jeremy Gaffney, Executive Producer)
&gt;For players who like playing cooperatively:  We want epically hard raids, which reward you not only for managing to complete them – but that allow you to compete for truly epic rewards if you can prove that you are better than everyone else on the planet.  

Good:
&gt;Each kill is more satisfying - Assuming the fight is fun, higher difficulty makes the victory all the more satisfying.  
&gt;Longer progression race - If bosses are harder it will take longer for guilds to clear all the content.  
&gt;Hero worship - If you see someone with raid gear, you know they really earned it.  

Bad:
&gt;Alienates all but the best - Many people like large cooperative boss fights but aren't particularly skilled.  
&gt;Harder to recruit - Makes for a smaller raiding community which makes recruitment more difficult.  
&gt;Higher chance of ""guild killer"" bosses - If bosses are tuned to be too tough, even decent guilds will fail to progress past a certain point, forcing some to give up.  
&gt;More class stacking - The harsher the tuning, the more likely the ""correct"" way to win involves benching your regulars and bringing alts of a specific class that works better on a fight.  


**Dynamic encounter mechanics**  

One of the most unique elements of Wildstar's raiding game, boss mechanics are expected to change each week, forcing top tier guilds to have many ""world firsts"" to compete for, instead of just simply beating the only version of a boss fight.  This isn't a new idea, having been used sparingly in World of Warcraft, with Halfus, Omnotron, Spirit Kings, and other fights that changed weekly or between pulls.  

Quote (Mike Donatelli, Content Director):
&gt;“Imagine a boss room in a raid. Then imagine a boss room where I can swap plugs, so one time you go in there’s a gaping chasm across the whole thing that’s shooting steam up in the air and you have to use your utility movement thing to go back and forth across it and not take damage, and then the next time you go in it’s not there anymore.  And now it’s like steam geysers with multiple tubes of steam. We can do that.”  

Good: 
&gt;Dynamic feel - If a fight is always changing, each week is a new challenge and feels fresh.  
&gt;Hard to master - If the fight is always changing, it's less likely to be solved, placing more emphasis on the ability to adapt an learn rather than memorization.  

Bad:
&gt;Hard to master - Defeating a boss one week only to not be able to the next due to changing mechanics is a demoralizing experience, especially when it blocks progression to later in the raid.  Mastery is satisfying.  
&gt;Hard to tune - Changing mechanics can result in significantly increased challenges week to week.  For example, Stone Guard in Mogu'shan Vaults 10man is significantly more difficult anytime the Jasper dog is active.  
&gt;Progression burnout - If guilds are competing for top rankings every week, burnout is a likely outcome.  Traditional progression races last no more than a few weeks or most, and many guilds call it quits before then.  It's hard to be expected to bring your a-game every week for months.

[Link to WSC Post](http://wildstar-central.com/index.php?threads/racial-height-comparison-and-silhouette.1887/)

The developers have stated they wanted to maintain a unique silhouette for each race, I was curious to see how each race looked stacked on top of one another and what the overall height silhouette differences were. So I used the new PAX East 2013 Character Creation video to snag some screen grabs and here is what I came up with. I tried leaving out all weapons and major clothing that would throw off the silhouette and well in the Draken's case gave them a long phallic shape at the bottom of their silhouette. I was blown away how massive the Mechari are compared to the Cassian, and the Draken.

I'm going to try and find some in game footage that shows them all in the same location so we can get a solid comparison of how large they are in the actual world.

That's all I've managed to pull out for now. It's entirely possible that I missed some abilities here and there, but this should be very similar to what would be seen in a beta client. Discuss away!

Also, if this post is well received I'll try and do another very very soon!

**Edit**: It should also be noted that the leaked [M30 patch notes](http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/m30_patch_notes.php) that Carbine themselves released delineate some of the more heal-focused Spellslinger abilities. Those notes also appear to be more up to date than this info is.

Reading this article about the [focus on Raiding](http://www.zam.com/story.html?story=32326) left me pondering this quote.

&gt;""4) There's some magic involved. Picture a game with no nigh-inaccessible content. You can go anywhere the first month, there's nothing left unseen. From one perspective, maybe that's great - there's no earning your way into Counterstrike maps, and that game's pretty damn fun. But from another...I dunno, it's pretty tough to have a mysterious, huge-feeling world when you can trivially do it all, and even in games I don't want to or don't have time to raid in I'd like to know there's more out there. That's arguable though.""

What makes an MMO live to my mind is the sense that there is content that must be earnt.  Content that goes beyond the planned level grind.

This gave me the idea that Wildstar should have an unbeatable end-game zone.  By this I mean an entire zone, filled with content that is so hard, it is impossible to go alone and even for a group/raid it is hugely difficult.

This unbeatable zone would contain items, creatures, content that could not be casually explored, content that would become the stuff of legend within the Wildstar community.  The reason for a zone and not a dungeon is it provides a more open-world feel.  You can go alone, but you will not survive the experience.  Even at cap with gear, this zone should be dangerous.

This may seem fiscally risky to invest dev time in content that maybe no one will ever experience.  But that sense of mystery, that curiosity about what COULD be out there I think is what keeps an MMO alive and what keeps a community engaged.

1369516808.0,33,self.WildStar,1f1r64,Concern: instant teleporting to various places around the world.,,61,28,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1f1r64/concern_instant_teleporting_to_various_places/,"**Hey everyone, I posted this over at Wildstar-Central and it has gotten some nice discussion going.  I wanted to include this subreddit in the discussion as well!**

**I got the idea to start this topic after reading that many people share my concern with too much limitless teleporting.**



When I hear developers talking about how they are going to implement ways for players to teleport all over the world, I can't help but wonder why? Teleporting to places frequently and easily is an immense hindrance on the game, because it severely trivializes the size and scope of the world; even more so than flying mounts do.

When I first heard (at PAX) that Carbine was seemingly carelessly implementing flying mounts into the game, I grew worried. I was relieved of this worry when I heard that they were reconsidering flying mounts after listening to community feedback on why they can be detrimental to the game world (world PvP, exploration, having people actually on the ground).

Then I heard that the LFG Tool they designed will instantly teleport you and your group to the dungeon entrance (after you have discovered the dungeon). Also, players can instantly teleport to their house ""anytime, anywhere."" I am puzzled by these decisions. You are reconsidering flying mounts, yet you keep this implementation in the game? Why make this big and beautiful game world if players are just going to bypass it all by teleporting everywhere? 

Flying mounts and teleporting are the two biggest causes that I have seen in MMOs for worlds being vacant. Do not make these mistakes; allow your world to feel alive by incentivising world play. Do not discourage it.

I am not saying that there should be a complete absence of teleportation. Teleportation can be great, if it is a limited convenience feature; like mage portals in WoW. Teleportation should be used as a way for the community to connect on another level.

Here are some examples of ways teleportation was, or can be done right:

1. Using my ""mage portal"" example again, these portals forced players to communicate in WoW. If someone was in Stormwind City, and needed a portal to Ironforge, they could simply find a mage and ask he, or she to port them. This might seem like an insignificant form of community building, but it all adds up. Based on what we know, I would say that the Esper is a great candidate for a porting spell.

2. Thirty minutes to one hour cool-down on the teleportation to your house (hearthstone-esque feature).

3. Summoning stones (as seen in WoW). When a queue is complete in the LFG tool, require two players to run (or taxi) to the dungeon entrance and summon the remaining three members.

4. A member of our community (Sabre, I think) had a nice suggestion in IRC last night. It was to have Settlers build teleportation devices in the world and players can use them when they are in need. Perhaps Settlers could be the new ""mages,"" so to speak.

I know that many other community members here on Wildstar-Central and on the Wildstar subreddit feel as strongly as I do about this, and I hope that they chime in and express their concerns about this as well.

In conclusion, I say:

I was pleasantly surprised with how fun the NW combat was. The biggest difference between NW combat and other mmos is that you cannot move while attacking, with *any* ability. Not only does this add a very healthy ""weight"" to combat, it creates for a very interesting mechanic when it comes to dodging attacks. NW has its own telegraph-like system, and being knocked down by a powerful attack from a monster takes you out of combat for a solid 5-7 seconds. 

It is my hope that Wildstar doesn't fall into the problem that GW2 had, where everything is mobile. There was always something about GW2 combat I disliked, and a [recent video from ZiggyDStarcraft](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=9UX33j0Dd54#t=196s) hit the nail on the head with why myself, and pretty much all of my friends, dislike it.

Obviously Wildstar doesn't have to adopt either method, but I much prefer the way NW plays. It'd be my hope that Wildstar is similar but with a floating mouse.

How do you all feel about it?

So, since WildStar isn’t going to have any Space Combat at launch I wanted to create a realistic simulation of what it should look like.
[This](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86400154/wildstar/wildstarspace.png) is what I've come up with.

So... yeah.
There are basically just some crazy flying Rowsdower spaceships and they apparently want to kill you.
You're in a Spaceship and have to destroy them all. You get points for it.
You might ask yourself: ""How to destroy so many crazy flying Rowsdower spaceships""?
Well, with your incredibly… normal weapon, I suppose.

From time to time there might spawn some [power-ups](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86400154/wildstar/powerup.png).
Those give you an even cooler weapon for full 10 seconds.

Feel free to play around with the config.ini ;) 
Don't decompile it, though.

Q: So, i extracted it. Which file do I need to open?
A: Don't extract it. Just open your downloaded file (wildstar.jar). It's a Java-Application.
Alternatively you can run it with command prompt:
Press WIN+R, type ""cmd"", hit Enter and type:

     java -jar YOUR_PATH_TO_THE_FILE/wildstar.jar


Q: It doesn't work!
A: Have you downloaded the latest JRE (1.7)? You can find it [here](http://java.com/download).

Q: This totally sucks!
A: No, it’s awesome. Deep inside you know it’s awesome.

**Title**: NEW RACE/CLASS

**Content**: Let's discuss theories of what you think they might be?

**Reality**: Nobody knows. It's a huge let down and I dislike you for getting me excited for no new info. I've read every forum on Wildstar-Central and this is a poor reiteration at best. It doesn't take much effort to figure out most ppl are on the same page: Zombie and furry scientist. BUT if you are genuinely curious, ADD A QUESTION MARK!



**Title**: BUSINESS MODEL: F2P IS THE BEST MODEL...

**Content**:... for current MMOs'. What worked for previous games  that might work/fail is that...

**Reality**: If you knew a billion dollar business model, you probably wouldn't be posting it on Reddit. Nobody knows; It's a huge let down and I dislike you for getting me excited for no new info. Go back to your Macroeconomics Community College class and LEARN why you have no clue speculating what will, and will not work, for a million dollar company. AND ADD A QUESTION MARK OR ""DISCUSSION"" IN THE TITLE. Else everyone will think you a crappy economist. Nobody wants that. You might have amazing insight, but it gets lost after thinking ""New Info, this person knows what is up!... Oh.""



**Title**: THE VIDEO/ARTICLE/FORUM  WILDSTAR NEEDS TO SEE...

**Content**: Why did failed games (the author perceives as failures, ignoring financial statements and current subscription numbers) fail. Enjoyability factor never mentioned.

**Reality**:  An egotistical gamer who can only site flaws with previous/current MMO's, offering no original ideas of their own except combining those that worked for some of the failures mentioned. This egotist will ultimately compare everything to WoW by saying we, as gamers, shouldn't compare everything to WoW, and then declare that their vid/article/forum will change the industry forever.

And their ""idea"" will be going back to vanilla WoW after it hit 4 million, but before it hit 10 million, ya know, that nostalgic experience that can never be recreated because that's when they fell in love with MMO's...

 Yeah they want that again.

Are we to expect that after how many years of development, Carbine will say after viewing this video/article/forum; ""Ohhh damn, we have WoW elements but don't bring back vanilla WoW nostalgia? Crap, start it over boys, I'll go grab some more money from the Money tree. Damn it! And we were so close to a release date...""

For instance if the Soldier path has an ability that increases his armour or shields for 15 seconds. Sounds cool, but something like that will be required for a tank spec. Or say the Scientist path has an ability that increases DPS. Again, it'd be 'required' for a dps'er. Heaven forbid a Path has an ability that can heal allies, cause a healer that didn't choose that path would be 'gimped' so to speak.

I would hope all path abilities have little to no consequence in combat, because I don't want to choose a path based on the abilities instead of on personal preference. 

I've found a few interviews that talk briefly about path abilities (I think I remember the explorer might have some kind of jump-pack). But I don't think I've ever heard them explicitly say they would be non-combat only or not be combat-useful. 

What are the communities thoughts? Would you be okay picking a path even though you might not like it in order to get a particular path ability? Or would you pick your path based on playstyle and just deal with being slightly less raid (or PvP) effective? Or do you have faith that path abilities won't cause any issues?


EDIT: I noticed there was a leak posted not long after I posted this. I have no issue peeking at my Christmas presents, so I went and checked it out and it gives a good amount of insight to what I was concerned about.

I'll go first.
I always remember how in old school Runescape there was a risk/reward with PvP areas such as losing items in the wilderness. Or my all time favorite the betting system that was in the Runescape arena, basically you could challenge people into duels but when you did so a window would pop up where you could set rules and depending on how confident you where risk your gold/items vs theirs. 

PvP is epic anyways but when you have that added risk that you may end up losing your most expensive item it really gets the heart pounding. It may just be that im a sucker for hardcore style content but its a great mechanic which unfortunately i haven't seen since in any MMO i have played.

1366396718.0,23,self.WildStar,1covdx,War Plots and how they re-invent PVP,Belyal,29,6,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1covdx/war_plots_and_how_they_reinvent_pvp/,"Pardon me while I ramble on but eventually I'll get to my point...

I have to say the more and more they show us inside Nexus, the more excited I become. I've been playing MMOs since MUDs were first around and RPGs (both game and Table top) since I was a young lad playing D&amp;D. And yes I really do think MUDs were the first MMOs. If you don't know what a MUD is you're too young and therefore missed out on the true beginning of the MMO. 

Now I've played pretty much everything as far as MMOs go and have been surprisingly happy with some and gravely disappointed by others (SWTOR being the most recent disappointment) and I must say I have been dying to find an MMO that really sucks me back in the way MUDs did back in the day and the way WOW did back in the Vanilla WOW days.

WildStar has definitely become that game, that Holy Grail of sorts for me and has just sucked me into it's world, creatures and game-play, and I haven't even played it yet! I could go on and on about all the amazing things that Carbine Studios seems to be doing right but I really want to talk about War Plots and what they mean to PVP in this MMO.

Now obviously there isn't too much that we know about War Plots yet and we'll learn more and more as time goes on but for me War Plots mean EPIC end game Faction Battles! For me this is one of the coolest things ever! WOW had AV which was an awesome PVP warzone that had dozens of players in it, and to me made it a success as far as PVP goes. (again IMO)

Now there were obviously issues with AV but it was a massive PVP battle and that made it exciting to me and millions the world over. SWTOR failed in their PVP in that it was only 8v8 and still is... Sure there was Ilum which was ""end game"" PVP fighting but they didn't do it right and they tied ""flipping switches"" to the outcome, and there was never any overall end or win in it, which is why Ilum and SWTOR PVP failed as a whole for me. People play MMOs for the MMO factor MASSIVE! They want Massive Battles in PVP, sure not everyone wants to do PVP but that's what PVE and RP servers are for... SWTOR never had a working Massive PVP anything and it sucked for me. 

Now we have Carbine Studios that has not only take to the MASSIVE theme for PVP but they have also put it in the hands of the players! We get to build War Plots! We get to create PVP war zones and we get to decide just how dastardly we want them to be. This now grants us unlimited replay-ability in PVP because no two War Plots will be the same. This concept is staggering to me and is exactly what a LOT of MMO players want and need to keep their attention long term. 
Sure huge raids are awesome and I cannot wait to run them a thousand times to gear up and get another monster head trophy for my house but the thought of creating a fortress of sorts and putting all kinds of monster ""traps"" in it sounds truly awesome! I mean the simple fact that we can create our own war zone areas is awesome enough but we can even capture and place world/raid bosses in our Plots... ""Ohh no we are being overrun quick fall back"" and ""defend"" then ""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!!!!!"" Bam the other team is in chaos now trying to fight you and some gargantuan world eating monster! I simply love the idea of putting epic PVP battles in the hands of the user and letting us tailor them.

It's a win no matter how you look at it! A win for PVP and a win for MMOs... WOW definitely set the bar high for MMOs and people have been trying to copy Blizzard's success but this takes PVP in an MMO to a whole new level and I cannot wait to jump into this game and hopefully even test this bad boy out in Beta.

I have to say a few things: Carbine Studios, in partnership with NCSoft are pulling out all of the stops to make a game that will surprise naysayers, enthrall fans, and revitalize the MMO industry. The number of people who have played the game is a fraction of 1% of those who want to play the game, and yet they held an event, and took players feedback on things. The community team at Carbine is really showing their passion for the industry, and the love of communities. The developers are completely transparent in their passion and love both the industry and the game. This event was not designed for the press, but instead, it was designed to impress, and I can say that everyone who attended this event is both humbled and thrilled to be part of such an amazing community of developers and fans. I look forward to my own future with WildStar and hope you all share that, or grow to share that.

**Edit:** If anyone is interested and would like to come chat about the new WildStar theme, and/or WildStar in general, hop on my Mumble server.  Mumble info can be found here:  http://exinferno.com/  

**ToDo List:**

&gt;- 1. Better RES Support
&gt;- 2. ~~Logo @ top left should take you back to /r/WildStar~~
&gt;- 3. ~~""Read vs. Not Read [visited] threads need to be fixed.~~
&gt;- 4. Look into having an option of a ""Light / Bright"" theme for people to be able to use.

**Update 2-16-2013:**  I have fixed 2 of the 4 big issues people have had with the theme.  I'll try and get on the other items when I get more time.  The colors have been slightly modified to keep up with the new look over @ the official WildStar Homepage.  Hope you guys and gals enjoy!

**More Updates...**:  
I have gone back through and tried to fix the RES bugs with commenting.  You can now read comments with RES enabled, but I don't recommend it.  I have been a redditor for over 7 years and have never used RES.  I appreciate that some like it and will eventually work on getting a theme for it, but for now, I'd recommend disabling it for this sub-reddit if possible.  I do apologize for the lack of proper RES support.  It(RES) has TONS of bugs that need to be fixed before any real CSS themeing can be done.

Please feel free to post other requests / suggestions.

1368637978.0,23,self.WildStar,1ee5pl,A Thank You and a Plea Regarding Limited Action Sets.,Vaeralyn,32,9,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1ee5pl/a_thank_you_and_a_plea_regarding_limited_action/,"Having been following this game since I first saw the trailer ages ago, there is one tidbit of information that has garnered my attention more than any other:  


**Limited Action Sets**  
I remember reading a post how this was recently decreased to 7 class abilities down from 9, and another thread that said the developers were aiming for around 15 abilities total (something about not needing a crazy MMO mouse to play.) As an avid PvPer in other games, most notably gladiator-rank PvP in WoW, all I can say is...  


Thank you. Thank you so much. *Please* keep the mindset of a lower amount of necessary keybinds. I say this for a few reasons (WoW is going to be used as the primary example, as it's the game I'm most familiar with from a PvP perspective):  


**1.) Balance** - As with any situation, the more variables there are, the more complex things become. Most of the veteran WoW PvPers I know readily concede that the game is largely in the most unbalanced state that it's ever been, and this is in no small part due to the sheer number of skills and classes that have to be balanced. With every expansion, new skills have been introduced without necessarily negating the old ones, leading to a monumental number of abilities across 11 different classes (and this doesn't even include racial abilities.) I don't fault the developers for imbalance, nor do I claim I could perform better; rather, I simply argue that not getting into such a situation in the first place is the better course of action.  


**2.) Accessibility** - I logged into multiple characters today to check my keybinds. My mage has 41, my shadowpriest has 39, and my warrior has 36. These are action bar keybinds, not including other binds such as setting a focus, targetting a focus, targetting specific arena targets or party members, etc. That's a lot of keybinds.  


So many, in fact, that it's the reason I cannot convince my old gladiator pals to return to the game, nor introduce anyone new. For the record, I've tried. A lot. Two individuals came back, arena'd for a few weeks, and quit because they claimed there was no way they could learn about all the different skills of 11 different classes while simultaneously mastering their own class, at least not without devoting the amount of time that raiders do to the game. And that amount of time is precisely why a lot of folks go to PvP instead of raiding. I also introduced a friend to the game brand new, and they gave out before two months. The reasoning? ""I've never played a game with so many $%&amp;^ing buttons. This isn't even fun.""  

    
PvPers *crave* competition, and for that competition to exist, there needs to be a substantial PvP playerbase. Egregious numbers of keybinds are too intimidating to most folks, and the result is a less competitive environment.  

    
**3.) Alts** - Alts are an element of any MMO that helps to keep things ""fresh."" Getting bored with your class? Play a different one. But if you're a PvPer in a game like WoW, good luck. I'm only bother attempting gladiator-rank PvP on on one of my characters, because the aforementioned issues combined with time constraints due to job and family (not exactly a unique situation) lead me to the conclusion that staying competitive on multiple characters is simply not an option.  
   
Although I've been following this sub-reddit for some time, I've never been one to actually contribute on reddit and had to make an account to post this. With the lack of ""official"" forums and the devs regularly commenting here, it seemed like the best approach to convey my thoughts on what I feel is one of the most important elements of Wildstar's gameplay.  

    
I readily welcome any and all opinions in agreement and to the contrary, as I would love to hear about how other MMO players (particularly Guild Wars/Guild Wars 2 players) feel about the limited action set and its effect on the game.  

    
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go check the 5 different e-mail addresses I signed up from on different devices and different IP addresses around town in the hopes there's a beta invite somewhere in there...

What is you take on the topic?

I personally believe games lacking flying mounts make MMO games feel very ""boxed"" in and two dimensional I.E. GW2 and NW (which I'm currently playing.) 

I feel flying mounts add to the reward feeling of accomplishing max level. 

I recall my first time seeing someone on a flying mount back when I played the burning crusade in WoW. It was awe inspiring, I wanted the ability to sore above everyone, to travel with no hinderence. It was goal setting.

The big debate was it killed open world pvp. This is where I feel WoW gets it very much right. Don't allow flying mounts in the new zones i.e. thunder isles (the latest max level zone in WoW) This keeps the element of owpvp where it belongs, at max level.

Most owpvp is done at max level unless your a low lvl ganking bully that gets no benefit out of ganking low leveling players other then personal enjoyment. This type of owpvp is pointless and just another form of internet bullying and shouldn't be aloud. Hell I play on a pvp sever in WoW and when I leveled, I normally found myself helping other faction members out when I saw them struggling because pvp at that level is rather pointless and a waste of time.

Anyway thats my point of view, whats yours?

Community has always been important for me and the only MMO so far that I have played with a designated social scene has been World of Warcraft. Stormwind for example was where everyone sat around waiting to do things.

I think it would be an awesome social feature to allow someone to use their house as a social hub where players would come to mess around and hang out while waiting for their dungeon que or their raid time. With the plug system it is all the more inviting for players to go to your plot. Not to mention the notoriety of owning the most popular housing plot in the game.

Same deal with my armor too. This whole deal kind of helped me get over GW2 pretty quickly (along with a few other things).

Personally I hope that quest rewards and gear drops will have enough variety in appearance that when equipping new items, it's enough of a noticeable change that you're like ""yeah cool, I look a little more stronger now!"", even when you don't level.

The loot items cycled being highlighted until the highlighting finally stopped on the one item the player will receive. If the player receives the item he had initially clicked on, he receives a boost in addition to the loot. Essentially a box of three items will appear and a RNG will determine which you get.

Is all loot going to be on a per-person basis, like Guild Wars 2, where I don't feel I should compete with others? And is killing random mobs in the world going to introduce tagging?

Max level. This is where the real game begins.


You've got dungeons, raids, solo scenarios, arenas, battlegrounds, achievement hunting and collecting.

But at the end of the day, the biggest incentive and largest time sink goes into obtaining the perfect set of gear. 


Obtaining gear in wildstar, like most MMOs, is ultimately the final way in which you progress your character once you've reached that end game content. 

However, there are some major issues with this system of progression, both big plusses, and minuses, and a myriad of design philosophy that surrounds them.

Lets look to WoWs current PvE design first:

* Upon hitting 90, gear is obtainable either through scenarios, quests, or gold on the AH that will get you up to the entry level heroic dungeons.

* This first gear ""hurdle"" can take about 12 hours if you know what you're doing. 

* Upon stepping over this hurdle, you must then grind heroic instances, spend PvE points on gear that you can buy, wait for drops, or do daily quests to get over the next hurdle, which is entrance into raids through either the raid finder, or with a group or guild.

* The process of gearing within raids is an artificial time constraint, not one based upon time in, time out. Raid lockouts, caps on PvE points, all prevent you from getting your entire set of gear.

* Finally, after you've geared up through raiding to the highest content, heroic raids, unless you're a month late to the party, this is the only level of gear progression that requires learning and ability to adapt to obtain gear.

* On top of all this, all gear is supplemented with select craftable pieces and gold sinks. If you've got the gold or the time to farm it, you can usually grab a few pieces of gear at any level of progression.

So looking at this example, the gear difficulty curve is exponential, with an extremely fast curve that slows down towards the top. It's easy to get gear fast, and then hard to obtain the biggest set of gear.

Positive:

* Everyone gets a set of endgame gear extremely quickly as soon as they hit the max level. 

* There is an option for people who want the ""Best"" gear in the game, and it's got a bit of a wall behind it.

* Gearing up at the start is easy, and you get as much gear as time you can put in.

Negative:

* There is an extremely low skill cap on obtaining the gear. It isn't a challenge to obtain a full set of end game gamer.

* The difference between the best, and the average player is very minimal, despite the wide curve in obtainability of the gear.

* Players that don't want to take the step into heroic raids, the hardest content, are left with about a month of content before they're left dead and dry on the gear grind.

* There isn't a feel of accomplishment when everyone is running around with the same gear as you.

Is the WoW model ideal? Does every piece of end game gear need to be a struggle and hard fought achievement?

This doesn't even touch on PvP, but should a similar philosophy of difficulty be applied, when your effectiveness as a player is even more largely gear driven? Should PvP be more accessible or less accessible?

So, I was having a conversation with a friend a few weeks back comparing key differences between World of Warcraft and Guild Wars 2. One of the more interesting points that came up was flavour or fluff skills. 

In WoW, minor or pointless (at least, in terms of competitiveness) content for flavour was plentiful. Warlocks could breathe underwater, Paladins could kneel and summon a column of light in prayer, etc. Minor glyphs were a big step forward in this regard. These skills gave no real advantage to anyone, but instead added personality, individuality, flavour and were generally just lots of fun. There's a huge amount of time spent in MMOs not doing battle, having the right abilities to use during exploration or social hangouts went a long way.
To an extent, this also included things like class quests (Rogues would get an assassination target and Druids would travel to their private community in Moonglade) and to a small extent, skills like Devotion Aura which didn't bring a great deal of impact to combat balance, but gave classes that little bit of extra personality.

On the flip side, GW2 based its skills on weapons and utilities. Sure, stabbing and slashing is useful in combat, as well as battlecries and setting traps, but this won't help a Stalker to pickpocket their unsuspecting victims or assist an Esper in meditating, bringing mind and body together.

The point I'm getting at is that although I'm vastly excited about Wildstar, hearing that there would be a limited skill bar gave me pause. Has anyone heard much in terms of class flavour skills? What are everyone's thoughts on such things? Waste of space or really freaking cool? I noted in the recent Devspeak on movement that classes would each have their own methods of moving about, Spellslinger teleports and Soldier leaps and such, which gave me hope. =]

I was wondering whether anyone knew how supportive of this sort of play Wildstar would be. Do you have to formally group to not siphon XP or loot off of other players by helping them to kill things and complete events? Do you have to group to share the outcomes of active missions in the areas? 

I mean, formal grouping is great if you want to run a dungeon or if you want better feedback about other player's conditions, but I've become too spoiled lately to go back to having to throw around or accept invites just to hang out with people in the open world.

**User Flair** ([Initial flair thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1i3k8c/rwildstar_now_with_4_more_user_flair/))

People asked for flair that could represent Race, Class, and Path in the last thread, so I had a go at a sheet that would allow that. I think the race icons didn't turn out too great after being scaled down though. If you can get/make a few good icons that would look good as flair at ~16px, let me know. Have a look:

* [Individual race colors](http://i.imgur.com/vNjFfzD.png)

* [Faction colored races](http://i.imgur.com/DKldVdq.png)

As for user flair text, I currently don't know of a way to pull it off while keeping faction colored names, so it's one or the other. If we added race icons, we could easily drop the name color and add in text.

I am pretty new to Wildstar, I only recently heard about it, but from all the videos and blogs I have read, it seems like a perfect MMO for my wife and I.

One MMO feature that I love, I haven't heard anything about yet, and that scares me a little. The feature to be able to 'level down' to a friend and help them play. Rift and GW2 had versions of this feature, and I thought it was great!

I am sure we have all been in that situation where a bunch of friends all start an MMO together, but after a few weeks, everyone is so spread out, no one can play together until reaching level cap. I think that is a big problem, as playing with friends is what MMOs are all about!

So, have the Devs mentioned or hinted about this type of feature at all?

I'm all for adding some WildStar spice to everywhere and anywhere possible, but part of WildStar's appeal is how it incorporates the things that DO work in other games and are accepted by the community. Strength, Dexterity, Wisodm, Magic/Intelligence, and Stamina have been used by a plethora of games, and whether by repetition or intuitiveness, I think people are accustomed and comfortable with them. I think the most confusing is the Moxie attribute, which replaced Magic, but doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Magic/Intelligence attribute that it represents.

This is exactly what I want in Wildstar. Challenging, awesome and greatly presentated groupcontent.

I do like other things in MMORPG's too, but mainly I play them for raids/Dungeons/instances/whatever!

The art style seemed too 'WoW' styled for my taste, that is to say cartoonish and unrealistic. 
And with rumors of it being F2P like many of other NCSoft games, I put it aside as another game claiming 'new' and 'different' features but would ultimately end up a different face for the same type of boring grind game with cashshop for everything unique, vanity related, or part of playing (like number of toons and bagspace).

But. . . 
I have become excited about many of the features that appeal to me and my varied group of gaming friends. The housing sounds great (who doesn't want to own a piece of the game and make your own mark on it?)! The PvP sieges (Warplots) sound awesome (Building a compound and crushing my opponents, hell yes!)! The idea of paths are such an awesome idea to cater to specific playstyles withour limiting your class preference! The action orientated combat is fantastic! I like a good mix of hotkey/twitch combat with movement and dancing to avoid damage.

I personally am excited about the idea of playing a settler and creating/building useful bits around the world and strengthening Warplots, while still having a class that can effectively tank to protect my squishy buddies (or dps like a madman depending on my alt choices).

So now I am a big fan and can't wait to hear about crafting details, release date, and business model. 

Am I the only one who has come from a 'This is not for me' to 'I am excited and hope it delivers what has been revealed thus far' position?

************
Edit: Thank you everyone for such great responses! I see there is a great variety of people excited about Wildstar, which is a great thing to have; means we'll have a huge variety of players in game. And that there are some folks like me who became interested after great features were brought to light.

Just to clarify, I don't have a problem with cartoon like graphics, I was just not looking for them in my next MMO and was surprised Wildstar grabbed me by the heart with it's art style and gameplay. I have played WoW (lol all the MMOs really) for many, many years and it was an excellent game and is a good game still. So I wasn't bashing other games, just using as basis for comparison.",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,1369729027.0,,,True,t3_1f4gxb,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1f4gxb/really_do_we_really_need_another_same_thing_type/,
1367983156.0,18,self.WildStar,1dwrgc,W* Discussion/Thoughts/Wants/Needs!,wildcar,23,5,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1dwrgc/w_discussionthoughtswantsneeds/,"I thought it would be a interesting idea if there was a thread where the reddit W* community would voice their personal opinions, wants, thoughts and discussion about the current state and future state of the game. I visit this sub-reddit daily and there rarely is anything new lately to read..

Personally I have a few things I'd like to see in the game and how I think it should turn out:

1. 
Please don't go Pay-to-win or free-to-play.

If the dev team has been following the recent launch of Neverwinter (perfect realm's mmo). The cash shop is pretty ridiculous and really seems to turn off players from playing the game because of the high prices and idea that if you have money, you'll be a better player. In short, the grind doesn't meet the reward.
Possibly have a hybrid based system where there is an option for players to unlock ALL the content with a subscription based system and the standard system that comes with the normal copy of the game..
	
2. 
Keep levelling nice and slow/rewarding and fun

Hopefully it won't take a few weeks to get to the level cap, personally I think players who hit the cap should feel accomplished and satisfied. Hitting the cap should be a slow grind and feel like a real achievement when hit.
(I hope you guys know what I mean, kind of like the situation with Vanilla WoW and the current state of it)

3. 
Give us stuff to do when in the main home area/hub(?)

Players spend alot of time in the main hub waiting for their friends, waiting in a queue to get in the next raid/skirmish, buying items, selling items etc etc. I was thinking maybe adding fun little gameplay areas within the main hub's to keep players busy, for example, since jumping puzzles seem to be littered within the game world, maybe have various jumping platforms through the area with a xp boost or something once players reach the top, have a item seller or some sort or just have it there for fun..
I'm sure there are many other things that could be added aswell.

That's all I could really think of right now and please don't get me wrong I LOVE how the game is turning out right now and I'm not bashing it!
Lastly, sorry If the above didn't make sense I don't really post much, if at all, but I'm really excited about this game and wanted to add my thoughts.

Please post and voice some of your thoughts!

This could tie very well into an in-game store that allows you to buy these items with real currency and it could support both the community (the makers of the items) and Carbine Studios itself, giving Carbine a steady income. The housing system is an unbelievable chance to implement something like this without affecting game balance one bit, and providing an in-game store that people WANT to use and don't feel cheated.

They coined the phrase Elder Game instead of using the MMO term endgame.

But more than that, this shows their entire goal summed up in one term.

They don't want a game that ends. They don't want to make a game for you that you feel like you've beaten. A great MMO never lets you feel done.

If you build endgame content that's exactly what it will feel like. Stuff you do once you're done. But you're done the game... Why do this extra crap they threw in to keep me busy if I finished leveling (I'm looking at you SWTOR and GW2).

Not here, we have Elder Game. The new game that exists when you finished leveling. The game for Elder characters, the big boys game.

Sure they rule with an iron fist but how else do you expect a galaxy of ruthless and terrifying alien races too respect you if you are a push over for anyone that comes along. Sure they made a few policies that a few people didn't like but everyone has too deal with it sh*t happens.

[NCSoft Sold Arenanet and GW2 Out For Nexon Investment - MMORPG.com Blogs](http://www.mmorpg.com/blogs/Meleagar/112012/24237_NCSoft-Sold-Arenanet-and-GW2-Out-For-Nexon-Investment)

[Consortium is Nexon/NCSoft? - Tyrian Assembly - Guild Wars 2 Guru](http://www.guildwars2guru.com/topic/83094-consortium-is-nexonncsoft/)

If you even just skim over the above information you'll see that ArenaNet (developer) has supposedly suffered greatly under NCSoft (publisher) and their new investor Nexon. So much so that ArenaNet has possibly added content to GW2 expressing their distaste with their current situation with NCSoft/Nexon.

Most of it supposedly has to do with the payment model GW2 chosen (B2P with Cash Shop) and how NCSoft/Nexon is controlling all the content in the game to revolve around it (similar to D3 being designed around its AH/RMAH).

Having said that, ArenaNet isn't completely blameless. It's clear that they've made plenty of mistakes of their own and have failed at some pretty key development points with GW2 (take [THIS](http://www.guildwars2guru.com/topic/83073-my-beefs-w-gw2-arenanet/) thread for instance listing a constructive list of things that most players agree are still wrong with GW2 with no improvement in sight).

I personally believe that Carbine has already proved themselves to be great developers to rival the likes of even ArenaNet solely based on what we've seen of Wildstar so far (not to say ArenaNet is a bad developer, but I really like everything Carbine has showed us thus far, even if they have no development history). The thing that I'm afraid of is NCSoft/Nexon's possible influence on the direction of the game.

Basically, would you be willing for Wildstar to be P2P to keep NCSoft/Nexon's greed at bay (they wouldn't be able to monetize the game around the Cash Shop as much that way at least), or are you willing to take your chances with a B2P model similar to GW2 (I doubt F2P is a realistic option with Wildstar with how much time/$$$ has been spent on development already and with the general game design being end-game focused)? This is all assuming Carbine has a choice in the matter and/or listens to player opinion on the subject (it's getting pretty late in the development cycle; they may have already made their minds up on the subject).

I also just want to make it clear that I'm not against B2P. I believe it CAN be done properly, even if history doesn't really show it. If it only involved Carbine I wouldn't care if it was P2P or B2P (or a hybrid B2P with optional sub). My only concern is how much influence NCSoft/Nexon would have on it. I trust Carbine, not them.

Currently, for user flairs we are pretty much in agreement with the following idea... Flair icons for your faction/path, when you mouseover said flair icon, it shows text! That said text would include the server that you're on in addition to your character names / guild. That portion with editable text is still up in the air.

 Whatever that portion would be, it would be editable by you. As for people from Carbine Studios, their flair would be pretty noticeable compared to any other flair out there. It would have the Carbine logo in addition to what they do at Carbine to the right if the carbine logo icon.

Current plan is to use (most of) these little sprites here for the flair icons; http://imgur.com/a/5O21A

Now, regarding flairs for submissions. We still have not come to a conclusion regarding this. Should we plop little icons to the left of submissions? Text only flairs to denote the type of submission? Should we adopt (rip-off) the /r/askscience layout for submissions with a icon / text hybrid? Maybe a more subtle idea of overlaying the flair to the submission thumbnail as seen on /r/IAmA ? What would work out best? Should there be nothing at all other than a flair for official news and announcements from Carbine/NCSoft?

Please do post your feedback regarding as such, I am willing to hear your thoughts.

The winner at the end of each month could recieve prizes/cosmetics that gives solo players a chance at the bragging rights usually reserved for PvE guilds and such. 

Might have to be elder game content, but I thought it was an idea worth sharing. 

**Soldier**: Never ending Hold-out style missions where the number of waves completed can be ranked by player level. (or player range, but I would think higher level characters would always have an advantage. the more I think about these the more they would have to be Elder Game.)

**Explorer**: Timed runs on jump puzzles. These could be seperated by the type of puzzle (so higher zone difficulty would be harder, and have greater rewards so lvl 50's would not hang out in a newbie zone) or level of character on the puzzle.

**Scientist**: Epic scavanger hunt. No idea how to equal this across all levels, as lower level characters wont be in later zones, so this entire idea of Path related ladder missions might be Elder Game type of stuff. (This would be interesting in PvP servers, having to go into contested zones.)

**Settler**: Could be like a tower defense type game. Haven't really figured out a good one for this Path. Settler is more difficult compared to the other paths as it is so social orientied. Brighter minds than me could figure something out I suppose. 

So the idea is that you could have an infinite number of attempts at each mission. I'm still trying to figure what sort of advantages classes would play and how to reduce those, but probably wont know until release...

To my understanding, a couple of things have been confirmed. One, we no longer dictate our allotment of stat points upon level up, as was the case in a previous build. Two, conventional talent trees are not in the game, and I highly doubt a change that significant would go in before launch.

Does this not leave us with basically fixed advancement? You level up, your stats rise automatically in accordance with your class (or however they've designed it), and at certain intervals new abilities are unlocked. That sounds very reminiscent of Diablo III, which was fun enough I suppose but hardly the high watermark of interactive character building.

I know we also unlock abilities via our path choice, but those too seem fixed.

Short of determining which abilities are loaded on the bar at any given time, or what gear to wear, what kind of player input will there be when it comes to ""your build""? MMOs are fairly unique in that your character kind of IS the game in many respects. A great diversity in character builds and a great depth and complexity in build design is something that gives the game ""legs"", so to speak.

So, am I missing something in the patch notes/revelations we've had to date? Because at the moment character building sounds very...streamlined, for lack of a less contentious word.

How do y'all think they'll accomplish this? Maybe have Spellslinger a more mobile healer while Esper can dish out more powerful healing? What do you think?

Same thing goes for tanking between the Warrior and the Stalker. What's to prevent one class from being superior to the other in most/all content?



I'm mostly worried because I recently quit playing Rift where mages were the undisputed kings of healing in PvE; the only reason to bring a cleric was because mages couldn't heal each other with their primary heals, so the cleric would keep them alive.

**Edit: Thank you CRB_Gaffer for the quick response. It was just what I wanted to hear. Looking forward to trying the game out. [Link to response](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1b27t6/things_i_hope_carbine_keep_in_mind_when_making/c92ylff)**


I'd like to start off by saying that I'm pretty new to being a Wildstar follower. I've known about the game for quite some time now but only recently (last week) got really involved with it. This game looks to be incredible, but there's some things that I see in other new MMO's that can ruin the game. I've played a lot of mmo's over the years like WoW, Aion, AoC, Warhammer online, GW2, SWTOR, Rift and more. so I've experienced my fair share of disappointing games (not saying all games mentioned were disappointing). The game I've played the most is WoW. 

If you can help me ease my mind or have your own opinion on some of these things. please leave a response. Like to add something to the list? again, leave a response. I'd like to know what you think. 

**First off: Unresponsive Camera and Movement**
This is a MAJOR concern of mine when it comes to new games. Some games have a little bit of lag when pressing WASD keys or moving the camera. it might just be a few too many milliseconds delay, but it can be enough to make it feel really clunky. This is one of WoWs greatest strengths and one of the things that turned me off from some games e.g. GW2. [video of what i'm talking about](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONjFFDHnOs0&amp;t=6m50s).
It might be hard to see what i mean through a video, but I think that shows it pretty well. 
Yes, this is a fairly minor thing. But it do make a huge difference, at least to me. 

Another thing about camera controls that can break the gameplay experience is the ""smart camera follow mode"" or whatever it's called. Where the camera automatically swings back behind the character. I don't mind the option being there. What I do mind is when there's no option to turn it off. 

*Edit: In Ta2punk's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1b27t6/things_i_hope_carbine_keep_in_mind_when_making/c92x2z2) he explained that it seem to work like we want it too. that's a relief.* 

**AddOns**
I've heard that this game will allow addon support. I like UI addons and don't mind them at all. I just hope that Carbine will be really careful of what they allow in the API. 

**Heirloom Gear** 
I haven't heard anything solid on this yet. They did say ""I unfortunately cannot answer your Heirloom question, we'll have to save that for another time :)"" in the recent AMA([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1a88i2/we_are_the_combat_and_pvp_teams_working_on/c8uz4l7)). So it's a possibility. Here's my opinion on it:
I don't mind heirlooms if they're implemented correctly. I like that you can get gear to help leveling alts. The bonus xp on it and scaling with level is fine and it would feel pointless without it. What I don't like about the WoW heirloom gear is that it's so strong. In my opinion the scaling and xp bonus is enough. it should have stats kind of between green and blue gear (in wow), this way the heirloom geared players wont destroy everyone in pvp and trivialize all pve content. Also, this doesn't make all rare gear that drops while leveling completely worthless. 

**Path system abilities** 
(i cant find it right now, so might be imagining things. Let me know)
I heard somewhere, i think in a video, that the path system will unlock abilities. Now i don't know what kind of abilities these will be or if they will be available for competitive play. But it would suck if I leveled up my warrior with the explorer path cause it was the one I thought was the most exciting, only to find out at the elder game that I should have chosen soldier cause it has the best skills for a warrior.  If anyone have info on this it would be much appreciated. 

*Edit: Ta2punk's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1b27t6/things_i_hope_carbine_keep_in_mind_when_making/c92x2z2) cleared this up. if it's only abilities to help you do the path quests. then that's great :)*

**""Dual specialization""**
I'm not sure how the ""speccing"" works in this game yet. But I know each class has at least 2 roles. I want to be able to play both roles or maybe even have a pvp and a pve spec. It's not about the gold cost for me. It's about the annoyance of running and respecing all the time. maybe even several times in a day. 

**Botting, Spamming and Leeching**
This will probably be the most obvious of the topics. I (and probably everyone else) hate bots, spammers and people who go afk in a battleground and leech. So I hope there will be an easy way to report them and systems in place to try to stop them. 

**I think it was something else i wanted to bring up. But can't remember it atm. If i think of it I'll update my post**

I was at the Pax Panel for Wildstar this past weekend and the question of business model came up during Q&amp;A. The Wildstar panel said they have not determined how they are going to charge their loving fans yet but that question will be discussed over the next few weeks/months.

Personally, my preference is as follows.

1. Single Fee: Make it like the Guild Wars series, I'll pay once and I'll get it all. Easy.

2. F2P: I'll end up buying the ""mega pack"" or whatever they will end up calling it but really I just done want a

3. Monthly Subscription: I played WoW a loooong time ago and paid my dues but I don't want to return to that. It makes me feel too pressured to play.

1364175102.0,14,self.WildStar,1ay429,My PvP Concerns (Tier list from AMA),,19,5,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1ay429/my_pvp_concerns_tier_list_from_ama/,"I'm a PVP enthusiast, hardcore competitive player and sponsored pro gamer. I say these things not to brag, but to make a point that this post is from my heart. 

Here is the topic of concern to me:

**""We will have a tiered reward system for PvP, where:
Warplot Rewards &gt; Arena Rewards &gt; Battleground Rewards""**

Why does this statement bother me? Because with a lack of explanation, it's a scary thought. The order of rewards to be more exact. Battlegrounds seem to be in the right place. However, the other two rewards are IMO backwards.  

I will first say that I'm very passionately following Wildstar. I'm a part of the WSC community, listen to podcasts, watch videos and read forums DAILY. I'm not biased on any level and am very open minded. I'm going to release my speculations with the information I currently have.

Now here is my reasoning:

**Warplots**

Currently warplots have been referred to as the elder game for PVP. Which makes sense when you see this tiered list. Warplots will give the top rewards for PVP. 

**Warplots should be second in tier.** *Why?* 

Warplots will most likely be 10-40 man PVP. My concern is that when PVP is anything higher than 10 people, it becomes hectic and a zerg at times. Yes there will always be a core of 10-20 people that shine, but just like in old school 40 man raids there will be slack. The slack is mostly the people that fill a body gap. Yes, there is always a elite raiding guild where everyone is amazing. Even so, my point is still valid.

The only way I could see this work in a decent fashion being the top tier pvp reward is through PVP guilds. PVP isn't as appealing as PVE for guilds. I doubt there will be more than 1-2 PVP 40 man guilds (active) on any server. Either way, guilds were more for communicating and keeping track of buddies for PVP. I would not like feeling forced to join some zerg PVP guild to get top tier PVP gear. You will play warplots a few times a week and get the best gear while you mostly grind arena and BG for your other pieces. I guess that's where my main issue is. You will have these 40 man raid guilds who have better attendance and group performance doing Warplots on off nights for S&amp;G, while getting top tier PVP gear. Where is the equivalent for PVPers? Can we take our 40 man PVP guild and just get top tier PVE gear by steam rolling some raid? *I don't think so.* 

**It just feels to me PVP in Wildstar is viewed as some secondary option. Where raiding is the top tier option for the game. They should be equals, but in their own respect.**

Arena&gt;Warplots&gt;Battlegrounds

**Arena**

* You play arena with a group of 2, 3 or 5 (assuming).
* You play weekly when your group is available. Climbing the ELO ladder and unlocking options for better gear.

**Warplots**

* You play with a guild or get a invite into a group starting up a warplot battle (sorta like the bosses in wintergrasp. Get gear doing this optional content which is better than solo gear ""battleground"", but not as good as ARENA gear.) It's fun and serves a purpose for doing it.
* Is most likely made Tier 1 to get people to play them. Maybe they don't want it to be overlooked or rot if it serves no major purpose. This is understandable, but totally causes problems that I've mentioned previously. (Imagine if Wintergrasp/Tol Barad was the top tier PVP rewards. Everyone would have done it. It would have been way more popular). Until the release of the PVE bosses inside those open world PVP zones, they were hardly played.

**Battlegrounds**

* Play for fun with buddies.
* Play solo when bored or needing to practice. 
* Grind extra gear.
* BG's are like dungeons for PVPers IMO. Same goal and idea.

**Make Arena top tier for PVP.** IMO 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 based ARENA is like the holy trinity for competitive MMO PVP. So much time and practice are put into ARENA. It deserves to be tier 1. Getting top 10 in a battle group for ARENA is like being in a top hardcore raiding guild. Riding around on my *Gladiator mount* made me feel bad ass and showed my achievement. Riding around on *Mimirons head* I'm sure felt the same for a top tier raider. 

**TLDR;** I feel like Warplots being tier 1 allows any joe blow the ability to have top tier PVP gear. From a competitive PVPers POV this feel like crap. I feel that arena should be top tier. This to me is more competitive and allows the better PVP players to stand out. Condensed group play &gt; Large zerg group play for PVP. Raiding is a whole different scenario. 40 man raids might be bad ass and work well fighting AI. Making top tier PVP 40 man is just not the same all and all.

A ton of this is speculation. I'm not even 100% that they will have 2, 3 and 5s in ARENA. I'm read everything released on PVP so far from Carbine and I have to just pretty much assume on a lot of it. Again, this is my SPECULATION and my opinion on the TIER LIST they released for PVP.

My first huge post for Wildstar. I figured if I love the game enough I should give my honest opinions on the things that concern me. Thanks for taking the time to read this and anyone who gives their insight.

I am just wondering if Carbine has ever mentioned their philosophy when it comes to dungeon/raid attunement, as well as their stance on artifically pushing the average players gear score for each raid patch?

For players who don't know, in WoW, and several other MMOs, each time there is a new raid and new higher tier of gear, they upgrade the tier of gear you can earn in the lowest difficulty dungeons. This process ensures you never have to raid 'old' content.

For example, lets say at max level there is Heroics, Raid T1, and Raid T2. With 3 tiers of gear. When Raid T3 gets introduced, the Raid T1 gear can be earned in heroics, meaning that Raid T1 can now be skipped in the 'progression'. When T4 comes out, then T2 gear can now be earned in heroics, allowing two tiers of raids to be skipped. Blizzard made this change at the very end of BC and has stuck with the philosophy.

There is some back and forth on whats better, blizzards system makes sure that no player is left behind. During burning crusade (BT era), if you leveled up to 70 (max level at the time) and wanted to raid the new content (BT), you would have to...

Farm normal dungeons for rep

Get kara attunement in normal dungeons

Get kara gear

Get Heroic gear (once honored by the appropriate reputation from farming normals, and yes heroics were harder than the first raid, and kara was fucking hard)

Start to raid Grulls 25, KT 25, and SCC 25.

Once killing both end bosses of KT and SCC you can then raid Hyjal

After defeating Hyjal you can then enter BT.

After BT blizzard introduced sunwell, and realized that only a small portion of the community was raiding BT, and even a smaller portion of them will get to do sunwell. To combat this they added heroic 'badges' which allowed players to get Hyjal equivalent gear in heroic 5 mans. They then removed the attunment conditions for BT. This pushed the average player from a spread of content to either a new 'baseline' at Hyjal equivalent raiding gear, basically removing any need for Grulls, KT and SCC.

I can totally see there reasoning, but I hate it, and I know many others do. I know it can be a pain in the ass to raid old content once most guilds have moved on, but I figure that's the point of expansions. Its a reset that allows everyone to start their new journey on a level playing field. I personally feel like having a large 'journey' that my character takes is part of what motivates me to play. When leveling new characters, having to start them at the begining of the journey was exciting and fun, now you can power up your alts to 'catch up' with the new baseline basically after a few weeks.

What do you guys think? Has carbine mentioned anything about this?

EDIT: WoW also has a raid 'nerfing' schedule which basically means they nerf the most current raid continuously every few weeks to ensure that all guilds are progressing.

****
Detailed Version - It seems most MMOs that have been release in the last 2-4 years or so are often berated and ultimately fail for ""not having [or enough of] an end game at release"". So I ask Wildstar fans, how much endgame is enough endgame? What kind of activities qualify for filling in an endgame?

The problem I see is this. Most often the above complaint comes from players who are refugees from the big MMOs (i.e. WoW) and view endgame as small party dungeons and moderate to large party raids. They come from games that have had a half decade or a full decade to mature to games that are fresh off the boat. New games typically have a handful of end game dungeons and 1 or 2 raids. Technically these games are developmentally complete and are released to the public. Experienced MMO players, usually players who only focus on raids, who are used to having 10-15 dungeons and 5 raids pick these games up and blow through the content and complain about not enough content. Often the developers of these games include a multitude of other activities such as crafting, housing, PvP, daily style questing or some other unique activity.

As a metaphor, I see these players as patrons of a theme park who show up only to ride roller coasters when there's many other attractions one normally associates with a theme park.

So my question to the community is how does an MMO developer such as Carbine counter that stigma of new games? Is it an issue with how games are developed or is it simply a mental block by MMO players acclimated to more mature MMOs with years of developed content? 

In my own opinion I think it's a little of both though I would weight it more toward an imaginary problem of the community. For example if Vanilla WoW, often viewed as the glory days of WoW content, was released now and attempted to entice a player base of 12 million people away from an established game I think it would have had the same issues these newer MMOs have had too.",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,,True,t3_1fqkr5,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1fqkr5/a_question_for_mmo_refugees_how_much_wildstar/,

Does anyone else want to see Paths tie into PvP somehow?

some examples I came up with: 
Soldiers get a path quest to go fight the other faction to claim some turf. Scientists have to go analyze a recently uncovered area of Eldan Tech but the other guys want that tech too, Settlers help fortify and defend towns from attacks, Explorers go scout out the enemies side of the map and gather us some intel. It could be a nice boost to world PvP for the PvP servers.

Maybe even have the Paths tie in together! Soldiers attack this town! Scientists go analyze some structures and weapons for weaknesses/advantages, Settlers build a little forward base for your faction, Explorers help find a flanking position/ get a layout of their town.

Soldier, same thing Ive been doing this whole time in other games.
Explorer, not for me im not that guy as simple as that.

Settler, Its new &amp; shiny, ive never seen this done in any other game and it sounds so awesome.

I think this brings another issue, if things are the same with the rest of the playerbase(which is impossible for me to tell really), theres probably going to be an over population of settlers.

I know they are looking for ways to introduce open-world PvP in a meaningful way without cramming it down our throats.  So I would really like to get a quests that throw us into enemy territories to:    

1. Assassinate X many Draken's or Warriors
2. Assassinate X many lvl 80 players of the guild ABC
3. Build a settlement in enemy territory and have it stay up for X many hours/days (Settler)
4. Scan enemy structures or enemy players (scientists)
5. Explore the following enemy city (Explorers)    

I hesitated to put the assassinate missions as soldier only because, as a non-soldier, I would really like to participate player bounties.    

Just to make sure this doesn't get lost in a sea of ""Not everyone wants to get ganked"": I am suggesting this, at the moment, to PvP servers.  I am also recommending this for players at level cap.  This would really extend end-game, heavily satisfy the open-world PvP types (IMO) and add more depth/content to the Paths.  It makes a TON of sense Lore-wise.  The scientists would want to study the other cultures.  The settler would want to gain a foot-hold in enemy territory.  The soldier would want to be on the front line of the battle.  The explorer would want to explore these all new continents.  It also gives people who will be exclusive to a faction a reason to see these beautiful other areas they would normally not see.  I can't be the only one who found raiding another city and taking down their leader to be an absolute blast in WoW.  If you like this idea, comments and votes would be appreciated. I would love Carbine to consider this :)    

Even being on the opposite end of the bounties sounds fun.  Can you imagine chilling in a city and seeing a bunch of stealthy distortions moving in front of your face only to all assassinate a single player in the middle of the crowd who is /dancing naked?  What about calling up your guild to come to zone X because another guild was sent there to wipe all of you out -- massive guild battles.  Enemies putting up structures?  Call in /map to come start wiping them out.  I like those thoughts.  Also you can see a group raiding your city decked out in crazy looking epic armor and just be like ""holy sh**... run!""    

 If you are planning on a PvP server and thinks this blows, please speak up  If you are planning on a PvE server and would still like this on it, I'm interested to hear that too. If you are planning on a PvE server and thinks this blows -- don't worry this is primarily intended for PvP. Most of all I would love to hear suggestions on PvP end-game quests like this.    

 For PvP minded folks who think similarly to me and my friends, this is a game changer.  This would be a defining feature.

He calls it 'defecting'.

The idea is that you can change factions of your created character with a very complicated and very rare quest line in the game if you choose to do so.

I was wondering if this might be a good idea for Wildstar. The game gives me a feeling where these Exiles come to the planet not knowing what to expect. Maybe they end up liking the Dominion and want to join them?

On the flip side maybe there are some Dominion forces that decide they don't like Nexus or something the Dominion is doing and want to join the Exile's cause.

Just some basic examples, but I want to see what the communities feedback on this is.",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,,True,t3_1d5f0z,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1d5f0z/defecting_and_how_it_might_work/,

Another thing to note is that with every class supposedly having dual roles and recent speculation suggesting we would get a ranged/tank and a melee/healer. If they added a ranged pet class would it fit as one of these duo-role classes?

The combat system from what I've glanced at in videos and such seems to lend itself much better to competitive PvP than other MMOs, and was just wondering if things were more in the direction of chaotic fun with rewards, or lending incentive to hardcore competitive play? Not that these aren't mutually exclusive, but there's definitely a little community splitting with regards to them, I'd think. If there's no ""arena"" style play, that's fine! A stronger emphasis on competitive play is what I'm interested in personally, so any sort of game modes that support that would be awesome.

So, I’ve been passively following this game over the last year or so (although lately, it’s been much more active – thank you Wildstar community!) and I wanted to begin by saying that I can’t wait for this game to get going.  The look of the gameplay footage is beautiful and game mechanics, as best that I can ascertain, look fantastic—I am very excited to get my Wildstar on.  

OK, anyway, with that all said, I did have a question:

**For those of you who play MMORPGs with your significant other(s), did any of you have to deal with an SO that didn’t really play MMORPGs and then got into them at your behest?  How did/does that work out?**

A little back story:

For my birthday, I asked my fiancé for a game that we could play together.  She’s a great sport and begrudgingly agreed.  We watched some videos of stuff that was coming out soon™ and it occurred to me that she might enjoy the Wildstar universe or, at least, what we know of it thus far.  After showing her the *Get to know* the Dominion and Exiles video she seemed to be pretty interested.  To this day, (my birthday was late last month—that puts Wildstar on her radar for about the last month and a half or so) she appears to think that Wildstar is a pretty cool game and I think there’s a good shot in getting her into it upon release, which would make me (and her, I hope) very happy.  She’s not what I would consider a *gamer* but she certainly does enjoy playing video games on occasion (mostly Nintendo stuff, Mario et al.).

So, what does everyone think?  **What have been your experiences playing with your SO (especially if they weren’t really big on gaming prior to playing together in an MMO).**  

Thanks for your replies, everyone!  While this is my first post here, this Wildstar /r is bookmarked and I read it nearly every day.  Thank you all for contributing!

**P.S. Bonus question: For those that have had the pleasure of playing Wildstar already, how feasible would it be to play it with a gamepad?**  

I only ask because she prefers them to playing games on a keyboard/mouse setup.

THANK YOU!

Getting something, even if its basic to start with, will help guilds a lot in integrating with the game.  You will also see useful tools and ""guild starter"" sites like Wowstead pop up, helping players get more involved with the game.

As someone who writes these things for a living (for CCP Games) I'd love to get a simple HTTP-based REST interface to get basic information (in JSON) on guilds and characters with some simple or OAuth authentication.

Anyway I've seen the basic press videos as well as TotalBiscuit's hour long feature video with a game developer. I really like the idea and structure of the game with an equal emphasis on many playstyles and activities in Wildstar.

So here's an FAQ from many MMO releases: How fast is leveling? What is the highest ""level"" a character can reach? My hopes are that I can play alot of this if I decide to pick it up on release and spend time building my character. My opinion is character building is better than any ""endgame"" a developer could create. That and a fun system to set up PvP inside. :)",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,,True,t3_1ffhc2,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1ffhc2/any_good_information_on_game_leveling_pace/,

Rather than just having the appearance of sitting in a vehicle and moving quicker like virtually all MMO's, I would like for speedy travel to be *different*.  I'd like there to be some momentum and some flavor.  Rather than WoW style riding, I'd like it to feel more like any given action game.    

If moving forward I would like to catch air off hills.  I would like to gain speed going downhill, and lose it going up.  I think it would be even spiffier if there was some sort of beneficial interaction such as *tricks* you can do while in the air that could offer a short speed boost when you land.  This can also add some flavor in earning/learning/buying sets of tricks.    

Rather than seeing a mount run by me while I'm adventuring, it would be neat to see them intentionally swerving to catch air.  I think this would look best for *mounts* like hoverboards, and/or rocket-boot style things for parkour-esque elements.  I could also see this, later on, developing into an interesting mini-game -- if Carbine were to put in a simple track I believe players/add-ons could manage unofficial races.    You could have ""plugs"" for your house/warplot with ramps and invite your friends for kicks.

This way, rather than using mounts to trivialize and circumvent the world, you would be using mounts to further interact with the world.  As far as using mounts to circumvent enemies, you would have to actively find a ledge/ramp and fly over the enemy aggro range (assuming it didn't extend vertically for a significant distance).  You could even use mounts to try and get air to get to new heights for exploring.  Super bonus points if it can be affected by explosions/abilities such that you could have some air, then have explodium go off under you launching you even higher, reaching places that would be otherwise too high to reach.  It would be even further enjoyable if it took a little skill to be good such as landing on a down slope continues speed whereas if you land on flat or upwards land it would lose a lot of speed.    

This could also add some variety to a dungeon, should they choose to design one around it at some point.    

Of course, should a player choose to auto-run with a mount, they can sacrifice a little speed(and fun) of being actively engaged.

In MMO's I always have too much gold and end up giving it away. Personally, I'd absolutely love to play some WildStar Poker with friends and gamble it all away!

It would be a lot of fun to play mini-games and poker with friends while hanging out in game. This would serve as another layer of awesome content, but also as a currency sink.

I'm sure there are age/gambling/scamming issues included with in-game casinos, but with proper account settings they could be mitigated. For example: If age is an issue - make an age gate setting to lock/unlock this content.

These are just my basic thoughts. What do you guys think? Would you like to see in-game structures like casinos or arcades that provide another layer of fun content? What issues would these things create?

Update: Just had another idea. **What if ALL paths had a role in creating structures like these?** What ideas do you have?

Settler: Supplying building materials.

Scientist: Learning/acquiring the technology required to build machines, etc.

Soldier: Soldiers could have roles similar to Bouncers. NPC's break out in a brawl - quest pops up to keep the peace.

...Also: I wrote this as I was pretty angry about the 7-button-layout and I don't want this game to feel boring and only having like 1-2 damage abilities seems a little boring, doesn't it?

Keep on reading with caution. Have a nice day
----------------------
Good day hyped up peepz of the Wildstar reddit. I've been thinking. ALOT.
As in...Way too much. It's gone so far that all day long I hang around Wildstar's subreddit, Wildstar central and youtube to soak in every little nibblit of information I can get out of the internet about...Well...W*.

So...I've been thinking. I really want to tank and the only game where I ever played a tank (MMORPG wise) is WoW. And I MEAN played - Highlevel content n stuff.

So...With W* we will only have SEVEN Slots, so each spell we choose means giving up something else...Now, as a good tank I'll have an initiation ability - the jump we've seen from a few videos might help for that.

In WoW and some other MMO's there usually way a taunt so you can put yourself ontop of the current aggro first and you're guaranteed to be attacked for a few secs. Some games make it so your enemy has slightly raised attack for a few seconds but whatever.

So...That's 2 slots gone. In WoW I usually managed like 10-20 slots, especially as warrior. You'll need a strong DPS spell for aggro generation bursts, a shorter CD (maybe a bleed? Like that saw we saw in some vids) and a filler attack like the quick strikes seen in some footage.

That's 2+3=5. I'm a mathematical genius.

Why not more? Well, the site said that you'd need to manage defensive cooldowns or you'll be in trouble...So 2 more buttons for 1 long CD and one general Damage mitigation spell.

And that's it. You have a 3 key rotation of spells (which is a priority list of 2&gt;1&gt;3 since applying dots&gt;burst), 2 mitigation spells and 2 utility spells. Maybe you can swap 1 dps spell for some CC but that's it.

...That might come out as very bad gamedesign...To me, atleast. Sorry to say it like this, but I think this just won't do. I have little to no room to have a very mixed build, this goes too far into the MOBA direction, games like DotA or LoL, which I don't approve of. Yes we now have a rightclick autoattack, but will this really do? 

No room for debuffing etc. Or you'll have to have a 1-button-dps-rotation which would kill the whole purpose of the game for me...

~~~~€:Items and stuff will get their own Actionbar, thanks for telling me.~~~~

I hope that this will work out someway or another, or will be patched. This game's looking amazing and I really like tanking and if it feels good I won't complain any further, turning this into an indirect order to give me a beta key. Nyeeeh.

Have a nice day everyone.

I'm not obsessed by it, though. I just like the depth and character it gives the world we all will travel around in, in any given RPG. See i loved Warcraft lore, and yeah i'm going to refer to Wc3 and WoW because let's be honest guys. They made a hella good in-depth lore that gave Azeroth the feel of a real d&amp;d universe. This story that is not only scratching the surface of the universe, but is going so deep that the reader hungers for more, is that which makes the game compelling story and lore wise. This is all my opinion on lore in a given RPG.



 I did clear HC PvE in WoW and Rift, and i know that intriguing game mechanics and the balance of difficulty and fun in both leveling and endgame is what makes/breaks the game. 




Now i don't want to go WAY off the topic, so i will ask you guys. Is lore really important for you? Are you just going to torpedo through the game and leave it when you've beaten all the PvE content or when you're at the top of the PvP bracket? If you like lore as I, which focuses would you like Carbine Studios to have, and should there be things ""left unsaid""? I would love to know where you guys stand on this! 

Hope to see you on Nexus. It's gonna be f#@""ing fantastic! =)

Like is it gonna be the same as Diablo3, where you have all possible skill combinations for particular class and just change you skillset rotation at any time?

This week I would like to talk about the Action Bar(s).

As far as we know, we have about 8-9 abilities we can choose out of 50 abilities to put on your action bar, for every class. I have my own concerns about it, mostly the fact that there won't be much of a variety.

I'm going to make a comparison between two games, they are both entirely different, but they are both (rather succesful) MMO's.

**World of Warcraft:**


In World of Warcraft, you would have 5 different action bars with 12 actions every bar. The good thing about this system is that you have a huge variety, and every ability was used for a different situation. People would do different rotations, try to combine abilities in a way that it would be the most effective (PvP and PvE-wise), and be more invested in what they are doing.

The bad thing, though I didn't have any troubles with this, is that it may be overcomplicated. People had to write difficult macro's, they had to have multiple keybindings, it would make things just complex.

**Guild Wars 2:**

In Guild Wars 2, you had about 10 actions on a single actionbar, and that was it. I personally rolled Elementalist, just to have more actions than just 10. The good thing about this system is obvious: it's simple, it's easy to learn, and it's easier to make combinations between your abilities.

The bad thing, however, is that people were forced into one rotation. You also had a lot less situational abilities, while as in WoW, you had abilities to remove an enrage, magic effects, AOE, etc.

My questions to you are:

* What is your opinion on the current system?
* What would you like to see in terms of action bars?
* If you know any games that you consider to have the best system, what would that be?

I know some like that system over loot drops as they are guaranteed to get something they want in case the RNG gypsies do not favor them.

While I do fancy upgrading my wardrobe and fighting bosses and human opponents, I am sorely missing some objectives that aren't focused on fighting, but instead something creative and progressive.

If we take a look at all the recent MMO's since WoW, the pure objective has been to reach the level cap, acquire gear to progress through one of the many raid instances or go head to head with human opponents in a battleground, the open world or arenas.

Is there any specific reason, that other End Game possibilities have not been discovered yet? Have we, the players, expressed an attitude in such a way, that only PvP and Raids are the way to deal with progress?

I would really like to see something different, something that shows in Wildstar, but only very limited. Housing is great. I look forward to it. I look forward to acquiring new things for it, but will there be any visual upgrades to it - unlocking major things for player housing to an extent where this could be my only entertainment in the game?

Do we have something similar available? Something like major structures being build, which requires massive amounts of resources from every player on the server/faction? Will there be server/faction efforts to or simply guild/personal efforts to craft something spectacular that isn't PvP or Raiding?

I'd really like to see objectives, where you go away from fighting versus players and AI, to building structures, dams, bridges and the alike for the purpose of progressing the World instead of progressing your Character as the sole purpose.

Am I alone in wanting something different from slaying opponents?

Either way the league ladder is way more efficient at judging a players skill and ranking said player in a team based game in comparison to ELO which is used mostly in games like chess.

So my question to the WS devs, is why use a standard elo ladder, when using divisions and so forth are so much better? Not just from the ranking perspective, but also allowing you to become a self-sustaining esport of sorts.

1364005253.0,9,self.WildStar,1au653,MMO World PvP; a suggestion on how to make things better (x-post from exinferno),iGoliathi,12,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1au653/mmo_world_pvp_a_suggestion_on_how_to_make_things/,"Full credit for this post goes to my friend ""traemccombs"". However, I think this belongs here and he provides a good starting point for discussion on the issue. 

&gt;World PvP. It is a term used to described going out and fighting in an open world setting in virtually most MMO's. The problem is, typically there isn't any real ""World"" in ""World PvP"". Most of the time we are forced into whatever is the latest zones and most current zones while the rest of the world withers and dies with little regards to them.

&gt;In WoW, maybe you go and find people trying to fight a World Boss these days, and there might be some world pvp surrounding these events, but more than likely there's not much there. Sure there's the static Black Market Auction house with some PvP around it, and the occasional ganking here and there, but nothing really goes on in the other zones. And what does happen, is typically static and boring.
&gt;
In SW:TOR, you would spend most of your time hanging around Fleet because you wouldn't want to miss a queue.
&gt;
No one seems to get that there needs to be a reason to go out and venture into the actual World (and not just a bland set of daily quest hubs) to search and hunt on a weekly basis for something that isn't known. Search and Destroy missions where there is never a ""Guide"" or a pre-set place where something might show up.
&gt;
With the release of the new MMO WildStar, I hope they are listening. I hope they heed the warning I'm issuing. Give us something fun, exciting and unpredictable! Make it where you can't just go follow a guide, but only the word of mouth that will spread across the planet each week when you discover where some new tidbit to fight over has turned up.
&gt;
I didn't just come here with criticism, I have two suggestions:
&gt;
**Weekly World PvP Zone Quests:**
&gt;
Have a quest that requires you once a week to go out and FIND where some NPC or group of NPC's are. I'm going to use WoW as an example as it is what I have played for over 7 years and know the best.
One week you'll have a quest to go to investigate Red Ridge, or Silithus, or Nagrand, or $InsertZoneHere. While there, you simply fight for control of either some towers. Re-position them each day in the zone so even if you did the quest one day, you can't tell your friends where they will be in the zone the next day. This means everyone will have to scour the area to find out where the objective is.
The completion of this objective should provide substantial rewards to encourage people to actually show up and do it.
&gt;
**Weekly Travelling Escort Quests:**
&gt;
This one would be such that you'd have to go out and FIND where some NPC was in the world. They would never be in the same place twice, as they'd be a travelling caravan that would need your protection. The lore would be that they'd take whoever's help they could to protect them from the baddies in the zone. Both factions would fight each other over control of said travelling caravan to complete the quest.
&gt;
**Make other quests like these...**
&gt;
Make other quests where you have to re-visit all areas, including opposing faction capitals and other starting zones to encourage World PvP. The fact that WoW has continually created Islands for World PvP is ridiculous. It isolates the players and bores them to tears by visiting the same damned zones over and over and over.

I'm not positive that I read this, but I can't find any additional information to prove / disprove it. Also doesn't help that in most of the gameplay I've seen the races do seem to be limited in this way.

1345301694.0,9,self.WildStar,yfgsy,[Concept] Role Trainer Dungeon - Single person dungeons to teach people and certify them to fill roles.,traemccombs,9,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/yfgsy/concept_role_trainer_dungeon_single_person/,"So one idea I've had for a long time, is the desire to ""teach"" people how to Tank / Heal or DPS.  I've liked what I've seen from the video's they do seem quite helpful, and maybe it's the right way to go, but my way would allow people to get comfortable with dungeons, and know that when they stepped in... with real people, that they would possess the skills necessary to accomplish tasks.

- Concept

So the main concept is that you have dungeons people can zone into, and they'll be accompanied by NPC's that they can then ""Shadow"" to learn different concepts.  No real lore ( other than a Training Command ) would be needed to bolster these dungeons.  Effectively, you are going in to train, get better and be certified to participate with other people.  This could and should cut down on a lot of the PUG drama that goes on due to people not really knowing what to do when they are tossed into a situation.

**Certifications**

People like to get certifications.  They like to earn badges that state they know what it is they are talking about.  ""I'm DLV Certified for all roles.""  [Dungeon Level 5 Certified]  Having this certification can make it easier for Raid Leaders to know that well, in theory, this raider isn't going to stand in the fire.

**Role Training**

Tank / Heals / DPS.   Each of these Sub-Dungeons would have varying levels of skills that people would learn.   Let's go with say 5 skill levels...

...and let's use a Tank as an example.  

Level 1 could be ""The Pull"" and ""Initial Aggro"" where you teach tanks how to establish aggro.   AOE tanking.

Level 2 could be taunt to re-establish aggro from an overzealous DPS.  

Level 3 could be survivablity and cool-downs

Level 4 Positioning, marking, Line of Site pulls, CC management and how not to break it.

Level 5 could be (tired.... insert some stuff here)

The point is, when you reach Level 5, you'd be fully certified to start Tanking (in this example) a raid or dungeon.  

I'd like to think this could be gear neutral in that you'd be given a set of gear instead of using what you had.  This way you can cut down on variables.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the Dungeon Role Trainer could be one of the best features ever implemented in MMO's and allow for people to ""Learn the Basics"" so that MMO developers can start pushing the limits as to what players can expect from Raids / Dungeons.

PM me if you want me to elaborate more on this concept.  I know it's roughly laid out here and would actually like to talk to a WS Dev about it in more detail than just typing. :)

Anyways...  
Every single mmo that I have ever played, sticks to this system in professions: You have a profession level, and, if you create something at around that level, it will increase your profession level by one.  
  
While watching the Dev Speaks about house, when the Dev mentioned being able to Craft house items. This idea hit me:
What if, your exp gained in profession could be based on the resources you're using to craft?
Everysingle mmo there's a 'shortcut' for you to levelup.  
In a simple example, you can craft an armor with 2 resources, and gloves with 1, and both of them gives you 1 prof exp. In that way, most players will more likely to craft tons of gloves just to exp up (There's always ""guides"" for you to level up a profession, this way, guides would not even be necessary), instead of actually crafting every sort of different things, experimenting and giving it away to friends that uses the same item.  
  
This doesn't only cut off this 'shortcut' thing, but also gives a new dynamic in crafting and can affect even the social community.  
  
Well, I also wanna know what you guys think about it. Is it a good idea, or a lame idea?  
Also: English is not my first language, so please forgive me if theres any misspelled words.
  
**TL;DR**  
Be able to receive exp based on resources used. And not based on 1 recipe = 1 exp point. Point being not crafting tons of a single thing to level a profession up.",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,unknown-scientist-exile,True,t3_1fk6b6,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1fk6b6/suggestion_professions_in_wildstar_the_something/,

On the surface, and when applied to the right systems, it sounds like solid gold!  How do we increase re-playability? Randomize it!  Okay sure, let's add some nobs on our bosses and give them one of several random abilities once per hour.  Challenge accepted, my good sir.

But alas, it doesn't stop there.  If you've heard the same things I've heard then you've also heard that they want to expand that to include gear.  For physical appearance this sounds amazing.  What if we could have some random differences in the physical appearance of high-end gear sets?  A bullet hole?  A blood stain you'll never get out?  Yes please.

Where I start to get scared is when they talk about stats.  This is a common practice of A-RPG games where they toss a random combination of stats, with a random value assigned to them.  Well, random to a degree.. there are pools or point ranges for each tier.  This can be extremely frustrating trying to maximize your character's potential by essentially pulling a slot machine.  Granted, slot machines are addictive.  This also works in A-RPGs because content can be cleared very quickly and your chances at item drops goes up significantly.

What happens if we randomize stat pools on high-end raid gear?  I can see arguments on both sides.  Personally I think it might work if the min/max aren't drastically apart.  It gives you that drive to get a 'perfect roll'.  The problem, in my opinion, is if that 'perfect roll' has the odds of winning the lottery.... but.. maybe that falls in line with the 1%'er mentality?

Perhaps the random stats won't be an issue.  I seem to recall that stat point re-allocation/balancing will be part of the crafting system?

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading.  I would love to hear some opinions on the introduction of randomness into the MMO 
genre.

**EDIT:** I wanted to share a post from Gortok that talks about dungeon item ""examples"", where one or more attributes are random.  This gives people a little bit more meat to chew on to see what the implications might be.

Does each skill have a classification or is it related to the mechanic of each class. The best example I have to explain this is for Espers, the class I'm looking most forward to play. 

Esper generates Focus/Combo points and then some skills use them up, gaining additional skill strength depending on the amount of combo points consumed at the time of the activation. Builder could be skills that generate these focus points, finishers ones that consume them. Meanwhile a Spammer skill could be one that doesn't have a cooldown.

Some comments.,slyfox007,12,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1eks8v/attribute_milestones_in_the_m31_patch_notes_some/,"So glancing over the milestones, it took me a second to realize each class does not have 5 tiers for each attribute. I'm curious if they did this because of main attribute issues. No longer are players be allowed to allocate attribute points, and main attributes will probably get a bigger bump per level, so achieving non-main tier 5 milestone would be impossible?

I would rather have the freedom to go for a tier 5 non-main milestone if i want to focus my build around that. It would make leveling an alt pretty fun knowing the end might be something crazy. 

Maybe have the option to auto-allocate for well rounded builds for beginners, and un-checking a box will give you some, if not complete freedom.

Probably a balancing nightmare and wont see that implemented, but it's just a thought. 

And I can now say I am super annoyed with their new naming choices for each attribute. I get brutality, that makes sense being strength, insight for intelligence is also a good choice, tech for technology was just lazy...... and that is about it for my understanding.

Moxie and Grit are both definitions for courage. Surprised they didn't catch that. Not intuitive enough. Hopefully they will go back or think of something better.

Back in the beta days of GW2, there was an enormous issue with fighting monsters, dodging around them, only to have them instantly flash turn towards you to swing and hit you anyway. 

While watching gameplay footage from PAX and various other sources, I noticed often that monsters would instantly turn. Now, it was a big problem in GW2, and they attempted to fix it for launch. They made it better, but it still remains a problem. Instead of snapping towards the player, the monsters just stand there stupidly staring into space for an extra second, THEN snap.

Sorry if I'm making this out to be a bigger deal than it is. I always enjoy killing bigger and tougher enemies than me to test my skills and to brag about it. The broken mechanic makes it incredibly frustrating without adding much in the way of a challenge. Tera was a game that I think nailed the motion of combat nicely as a reference.

The game looks great so far, but I have some questions/ideas that I want to talk about. Hopefully this community can help me clarify some of my questions. As to the ideas...I hope there are still some Carbine-Employees around to give me some feedback (the community's feedback is welcome as well). Let's get to the good stuff shall we?

**1. Arena:** Yesterday we got to read about a new part of the elder game i.e. arenas. I really like the diversity of WildStar, that's why I hope I can do it all upon release (PvE, open PvP, Arenas, etc.). My concern is that people will rush the content to max level to get to arenas as soon as possible in order to get ahead with their arena rating (first come first serve). I want to enjoy my leveling process and discover/read as much about the universe as I possibly can, but I am afraid that the process will take too long and the ship will already have sailed for me to compete with pvp'ers who have already been doing arenas for a week or two. My suggestion is that upon release you delay the start of the arena season (which is probably the plan, I just wanna make sure).

**2. Stealth mechanic:** The Stalker class is the stealthclass as we all know. I am just wondering whether there is permanent stealth or not. Also, are you able to detect stealthed players/mobs (a sound plays, as it does in WoW or similar things) and are you then able to hit them with your skillshot-esque abilites to deal damage or break stealth?

**3. Idea Skillshots:** (I am just calling them skillshots because of LoL). What I like in LoL is that you can keybind your keys (i.e. Q-W-E-R) to use a mechanic called smartcast, which allows you to use an ability without confirming the ability via a click. You just press the button for your ability and your character performs the spell instantaneously pointing into the direction of your mouse cursor. I think this would be a nice feature for WildStar. Similar mechanics are macros with mouseover commands like WoW has (will there be macros?). Also can you integrate modifiers for you keybinds? This mechanic is very beneficial especially for healers who want to use the same key for healing themselves or others by just adding a modifier like alt or shift (or a mousebutton).

**4. Housing:** I am curious about the bonus xp mechanic in WildStar. By accumulating more stuff for your house you increase the bonus xp you get for resting in your home. Do you obtain enough items for your first character to make it beneficial or is this mechanic primarily for a second character? Is there a benefit for a max-level character in having this rested bonus xp?

**5. Beta:** Last point I promise. Lately more and more games have beta events before launch, everyone loooooves betas :) as do I. My questions is: How good of a chance is there for a fan residing in Europe (Germany) to get into the beta? As for Blizzard betas I am not optimistic anymore because they seldom give beta keys to Europe and if they do they give beta keys to the US several months before which I find very annoying. I know there are latency and time zone issues but I believe everyone around the globe makes a good beta candidate, so hopefully Carbine does not ignore their alien fanbase :)

""One of the biggest differences you’ll see in WildStar Arena gameplay is that our Arena match is not a single elimination match. Each team shares a set amount of respawns (based on the match size). To win an Arena match, your team must get the opposing team to use all of their respawns and then defeat any remaining living opponents.""

Personally I'm not sure how I feel about it. This could be interesting or maybe not. Maybe it will be bad. I suppose it might be hard to tell before we know more about the game. Since I'm having a bit of trouble figuring this out I thought I'll open it up for discussion.

A couple of the highlights include: 

1. Raids are leaning towards requiring more than 10 people. I kind of hope that they ask for 25+ because I loved getting together with a full guild and spending a few hours every night to down bosses. But I understand some people just don't have the time to do that.

2. Nearly every race can access every ""role"". I don't mean like ""healer"", ""tank"", ""DPS"" but rather that a Granok will be able to be dexterous, it'll just be a little more difficult than an Aurin. Of course, the Aurin would have similar trouble being strength based rather than Dexterity based.

At 10 minutes they ask him about the Chua gender thing and he says ""that its a closely guarded secret of the dominion"".

So after thinking about this for a while I think I might have a solid theory on why we don't see any Female Chua around...

They are all in the hands of the dominion, specifically the Mechari.

From the lore it sounds like the Mechari found the Chua put some tools in their hands and told them to have fun and they built an entire civilization on destruction. Now after being elevated by the Mechari they ripped apart their home world and subsequently any and all forms of natural predators that they likely had. Suddenly the Chua, A rodent-like species, had unlimited resources, a whole planet to expand to and when you take away the only means of natural population control, getting eaten, the Chua filled the planet.

So after seeing what happens when you leave the Chua unsupervised they took measures into their own hands and captured all of the Female Chua and have been using them to control the population growth to manageable levels. This also allows them to selectively breed them to try and control the course of their evolution making them a more stable element in the dominion.

TL;DR the Mechari have all the female Chua to control the population growth of a race that fucks like rabbits",Discussion,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,discussion,,True,t3_1isiqe,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1isiqe/possible_lore_based_reason_for_no_chua_genders/,

I've bought into the WildStar hype (following the news, watching gameplay videos, watching videos discussing these gameplay videos :) ) and I am really pumped for this game to come out... I WANT IT NOW.

Anyway, since it isn't out now, i am trying to find ways to calm myself down I've decided to start creating a website dedicated to Wildstar content (for when the game is actually released.)

What sort of things would you like to be able to do with a third party website? I was thinking things like maybe Guild management tools (say you can create and join guilds, and GMs could create events that would automatically be emailed out to memebers, guild calendar etc.) A section for user created class guides where you could fill out a template, and viewers could rate it based on the information (Like lolking does with champion guides.) maybe a forum section... etc

I'm not sure what sort of API wildstar is going to make available to actually query game data (which would be banging if anyone could give me more info.) But if that becomes available that could open up the possibility of doing some really cool stuff, like progression tracking... view your character from the web (like wow lets you do etc.)

Anyways, this post is getting long, so i will wrap it up. Just looking for your thoughts on what sort of content you would like to see/be able to create, from a site like this.

One of the things that really made Vanilla WoW so...volatile, was the inclusion of faction specific classes. It created a genuine rivalry between the two factions. We had Paladins, they had Shamans. The lore, the banter, the imbalance whining. It was all very fun and healthy and in many ways created faction loyalty. Blizzard really destroyed that faction loyalty when they released Burning Crusade. Don't get me wrong, BC is still the best WoW experience I've ever had but for many reasons other than giving each faction Paladins/Shamans. 

So what does Reddit think about faction specific classes or paths? We still have lots of time for them to be potentially included if there's enough demand for them and I think that in a game that is going to have open world PvP and wants to include incentives to open world PvP, creating a sense of faction loyalty is one of the most important things you can do and you can't expect people to go off of lore alone.

And to continue that thought, what do you think could possibly pass off for faction specific classes/paths for the Exiles and Dominion?

And another thought is maybe there's another specifically and strictly ingame way to create a greater sense of faction loyalty, what are some thoughts of what else they could do to increase this?

The issue I see here is that dodge in Guild Wars 2 is essentially THE damage mitigation/avoidance mechanic. Having buffs that increase the amount you can dodge make huge differences in how well you survive. 

This dodge mechanic (in GW2) is incredibly disappointing, because it essentially means the player becomes immune to damage for a second (or so) every time they dodge. For example, a boss can use a huge attack that would normally hit everything within 10m of him, but if you dodge at the right time and are still within 10m of him, you're totally fine. This really disappointed me because in real life, dodging serves as a way to move quickly out of the way of something/someone. In GW2 it's just invulnerability with a brief duration and animation.

Will WildStar suffer from the same poorly implemented dodge mechanic, or is dodge more a way to move quickly out of the way of telegraphed attacks? Can it be used as often and if it is the same as GW2, do you guys think WildStar might suffer from having dodge as a major damage mitigation/avoidance mechanic?",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,,True,t3_1cjtp6,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1cjtp6/brief_questiondiscussion_about_the_dodge_mechanic/,

But I have a concern regarding Paths and smaller scale group play. 

Often, I'm play with my friend in MMO's, usually we play almost all of the content together - me playing a specialized healing build and him a more offensive or tanky build. This works out perfectly when we play together but in many cases in MMOs there will be gated areas that will force us to be separated - usually these are solo missions/quests that is instanced. So, as I play a support focused build, going through content like this will take me much longer than it would take him. 

Paths, especially explorer, seem to do this separation of groups. Specifically, explorers can have access to specific areas in zones. Anyone that is not an explorer will not be able to access these areas. So the problem occurs if one of us plays an explorer path, then often - we'll be separated, something I do not want. Explorer is a specific example of this problem but it can occur with other paths as well. So could there be any fix to this, aside from us playing the same path?

Perhaps to allow a character of a specific path to pull group members into their path exclusive zone, so this allows groups to consistently play together without some people being gated from each other. Not only this, it could also put a nice spin on how groups are put together, different paths have access to different things so ideally having a group with a mixture of different paths can help maximize the group's effectiveness.  

There is of course, problems with this. Players with exclusive access to specific content that could be considered extremely helpful can use the grouping system to pull other players into their content for their access whilst charging a fee (like a taxi if we use explorer's shortcut tunnels as an example). This may or may not be a problem in the long run but it sure is a concern when I think about my suggestion.

Update: http://www.wildstar-central.com/index.php?threads/carbines-answers-to-the-patch-note-questions-collected.2483/

Few questions. For the new ""auto-attack,"" am I correct in reading that as ""filler skill"" as in something with no (other than global) CD, consumes no resources, weak skill to be used when all else is on CD? If this is on RMB, can we not use RMB to turn the camera and character at the same time like in WoW? Can it be moved to elsewhere on a user by user basis?

Not patch note related, but beta related: In the new TB video from yesterday there was mention that ""we are currently in closed beta"" and that a few thousand more invites were going out in April. This really confuses me since he says in part one that this was recorded at PAX, during which you were not in closed beta. Can you clarify that comment? Was that just a slip of the tongue and you meant internal testing and the ""few thousand"" invites was the waves we've already seen or is that actual correct current info somehow given weeks in advance of it becoming true?

**Jeremy Gaffney said: ↑**

**I suspect he meant Friends and Family and got confused. We had a go/no go call between PAX and the CBT1 deployment on whether we were going to go live on the April date or wait until a May deployment, so he could easily have been wrong on the few thousand invites in April too.**

**Frosty (the guy in the interview) is generally super-clued and is also the voice of our DevSpeak videos. If you haven't seen the DevSpeak housing video (the one with the chalk marks, not the Protostar one), I recommend checking it out. So we won't hurt him too hard.**

**Who are we?**

&lt;Ex Inferno&gt; is a guild / community of like minded folks that enjoy PvP&amp;PvE.  Our [**Core Values**](http://exinferno.drupalgardens.com/content/core-values-and-beliefs) bind us together and create a mature, fun community for gaming.  We've played SW:TOR together and WoW too, and we really believe in where WildStar will be taking MMO Gaming.

**How can you get involved now?**

Well, if you play WoW, we have (L25) Horde &amp; Alliance guilds on Korgath.  It is one of the better progressed and larger WoW servers.  You can roll a toon if you'd like, get to know us and see a bit of what we hope to achieve in WildStar.

**Cross Faction? Why?**

We will have both Exile and Dominion guilds and have a PvE&amp;PvP focus. We will only be on a PvP server though. The reason for having both guilds on both factions is so we can have coordinated, weekly World PvP ""Guild vs. Guild"" encounters.  It's fun killing people you don't know, it's even more fun fighting people you DO know and can talk smack for the whole week when your group has been dominate!  

Most folks will eventually have a level cap toon on both sides.  And if you've read the ""Core Values"", you'll understand that if anyone messes with &lt;Ex Inferno&gt;, they will be dealt with!

For raids, we also have casual groups for raiding as well as progression groups.  This way there is something for everyone.  Both Exile and Dominion Progression raiding teams will be working hard to down content before the other group does.

One of my biggest complaints with TERA is the combat. It locks into animations, and the combat felt like attack, move, attack, move, attack. This personally becomes really repetitive, easy to do, and boring.

If anyone here has played Dragon Nest, the combat was much more fluid. You were able to attack and run, or attack and jump over obstacles. You were not limited to move and then attack and then move. It also had dodge abilities as well. The locked animations were expected (like if you jump, you wait to land, as opposed to in TERA, you are swinging an axe so you'll have to wait until it is done swinging and you recover before you can move). Dragon Nest had some serious issues, but the combat was largely not part of them.

Even World of Warcraft has lots of movement these days, and has absolutely no locking into animations (Cast times is different than animations).

The videos I've seen of this game really have the appearance of a character standing still and attacking, pressing dodge when appropriate etc.

Does anyone know, are characters locked into uncomfortable animations? And is this method of stationary attacking the direction they are going? (Not that I find it necessary, but I'm curious if every class could do an entire fight without needing to stop walking).

I know the game is still in early development, but this is when they are making these choices!

The system let's you queue up as DPS, healer, or tank depending on your class. It then finds you a pug group comprised of a standard dungeon group (healer, 3 DPS, and a tank) and teleports you to the dungeon and ports you back when you are done. For doing this you are rewarded extra exp, gold, and a bag that give you a random piece of level appropriate armor.

I'm not here to say I want one in-game, because I feel the system is a double-edged sword. When the dungeon finder was first introduced I was actually pretty excited because I was never really given the chance to run through most of the dungeons. This was mainly due to the fact that it was pretty difficult to form a group of people who were the correct level, the right classes, and had an actual interest in doing them. Plus they all had to be located on your realm. I remember spamming ""LFG for (insert dungeon)"" for what seemed like an eternity in chat before finding anyone who was interested. This created a quick way to group with people across different servers and do dungeons, the extra loot/exp was pretty great too.

And herein lies the problem. Dungeon finder quickly became the preferred way to level for most people. This left most quest hubs pretty empty and almost made regular questing obsolete up to a certain point. It sort of became a race to see how fast you could get to level 15 so you could actually use the thing. You could argue that this gives older, more experienced players a way to quickly level their alts, but what of new players? They are left to quest in empty zones alone, which tends to get pretty boring and are almost pressured into using dungeon finder. As a result a lot of content in the game just ends up rarely if ever being used because of it.

Raid finder is whole different animal because my experience with it is very limited. Though from my understanding it looks like it can be pretty useful for those who aren't in guilds who raid a lot or don't have enough time to play with a dedicated raiding guild but still want to experience raiding.  


**tl;dr** Dungeon finder is a double-edged sword. It can be used to show a lot of content and level your chars quicker but you could also miss a lot of content as well. I guess I personally would prefer not to see a dungeon finder in-game.

Based on a similar assumption, the classes are likely left = melee and right = ranged. Leading me to believe we have one ranged and one melee class left.

I'm hoping for a magic/spell based melee like a shaman or monk. I could easily see either a ranger or elementalist style class for the ranged. Any thoughts on this? Does my speculation seem correct?

* At the launch how many dungeons/raids are there set to be?
* Are dungeons at endgame just heroic versions of dungeons that can be done while leveling? If so do they have additional bosses?
* Is there any 5 man content that is very difficult and long? As in an endgame dungeon that has sort of 10-15 bosses and is set at just before/raid difficulty, something that you clear with a party of bro's over a couple of nights, not something that can be initially zerged down in less than an hour
* In regards to character advancement, is the only way to advance further your characters combat statistics by getting better gear? Are there any additional advancement mechanics? If the only way is gear, is their tiered gear or how does it work?
* How large are the raids in terms of bosses and do they have multiple ways to advance through them (E.G Naxxramas wings)? Im a fan of large raids that have multiple sections.

Anyways sorry for the large amount of somewhat 'nooby' questions, if anyone could shed a bit of light that would be very much appreciated!

It is important to note that WoW (which carbine is making a point of comparing Wildstar to) has tried a number of differnt styles of gated progression. From vanilla where there where some attunements but mostly it just made it easier for you to get to the raid if you were attuned, to BC where attunement was necessary and the attunement was gated as one raid would unlock attunement to the next and soforth - in both these cases content in these raids where unlocked from the start.  To WotLK where there were no attunements but content was delayed on a weekly release table (i.e. each wing would become availble a week after the one before it was released), and then to Pandaria where in t14 you needed to complete Heart of Fear to unlock Terrace of the Endless Springs, but otherwise there was no gated progression in the way of attunements or gated content.

I personally thought that attunements where an interesting way at the start of the expansion to offer an introduction to raiding but after a while they were just annoying setbacks as you had to get players attuned if you wanted to recruit them into your guild.

**Q:How are holograms working against enemies on higher ground?**
A:IMO quite well.  Water/aerial combat is where they have the most trickiness (so we tend to disincent that, water combat is often quite a pain anyways because people don't necessarily operate in 3-space well (just ask Khan).)

**Q:Can someone who hasn't recieved/completed the PreBeta survey back at february participate in the coming beta test two or stess test?**
A: Yep.

**Q:If so, will there be an another wave of surveys before Beta 3?**
A:Yep.  Troy's doublechecking this though, to make sure - so I might edit this.

**Q:At launch or post lunch, will there be a spectator mode to watch the epic 40 vs 40 Warplot  matches?  **
A:currently on the post-launch plans, but plans do change - so no promises one way or the other.  Half the team is addicted to LoL so e-sports is a thang for us, but we do want to ship in our lifetimes.

**Q:What will the language be for writing add-ons/mods?**
A: LUA.   Also, Houston is our tool to help more easily make them.  Lots of add-ons already being generated by even the tiny community in CBT1 (about 2000 folks)

**Q:WILL I be able to pilot a space ship? (However big or small.) I've seen them docked in the yard, for instance, in the Housing Dev! :D**
A:Space ships:  Actually we built the whole world intending for flight from day 1.  But there's a bit of a backlash in the community right now around flight trivializing content/making the world too small.  So we're listening to those debates right now, if I can be honest.  Back when I/we launched City of Heroes flight was  a big deal, so it's interesting to me now to hear the backlash.   Opinions welcome.

After this the thread got into a very heated debate on the pros and cons of flying mounts. In response to all the suggestions in the thread Jeremy had this to say: 

""Other alternatives include limited flight (via a gas tank on your speederplane or w/e), mounts unlocked per zone (so that you can be a badass once you've unlocked the main quests, but that might feel too game-y) and more - we actually have a meeting later today to bounce the latest alternatives off of each other.""

**Q: What will your guild system be like? (I'm coming primarily from a WoW background, so I'll be comparing. ;D)**
A: We do guilds, haven't announced a ton of the different stuff in 'em yet.  We also do circles which are guilds-lite, allowing you to more casually bond with numbers of different friends with different interests.

**Q: There's rumors that classes can only wield one weapon type (As in warriors can only wield two-handed swords, spellslingers can only wield guns etc). Is this true?**
A: In general you get a weapon type per class, with some exceptions - like Warhammer did back in the day.  Why?  Lets us do unique animations per class/attack and have more visual oomph in combat, and makes class silhouettes unique.  Tradeoffs are making sure there's enough variety in your weapons and making sure more than 1/7 of the weapon drops are useful to you (that's on us to make sure we do a good job around that)

**Q: If I submitted multiple beta invites due to changing information (in a guild, out of a guild, changed emails, part of a WildStar press project, etc) does that ruin my shot at beta due to it looking like I'm trying to artificially inflate my odds?**
A: We filter out duplicates so that doesn't help or hurt you too much, so don't sweat it too much.  Our default answer on any given question is ""what's the rational thing to do"" and then we try to do that.

**Q: When it is going to be released ?**
A: As soon as we have fun, varied leveling content up to cap and solid elder games around each major playstyle, is the honest answer.  We'd like that to fall in 2013 but honestly getting it right is more important than hitting a date; you only get to launch once and the mentality of ""launch a patcher and then fill in the game"" has killed more MMOs than any other disease.

**Q: when are the last 2 races being announced??**
A: One of the races are such mischievous bastages that we're pretty sure they're trying to announce themselves against our will.
Next few months in all likelihood!

**Q:Can you give any information on how you going to cater to solo players at Eldergame?**
A: Sure:  Short form is we're aiming for at least one big dynamic area chock full of PQs and other solo/semi-solo content, regular new consumable content advancing the world story (approximately once a month but if we're cool like the GW2 guys we'll speed it up even more), deep housing stuff (some revealed some not), and more.  Around the end of the summer we'll lift the veil on a lot of the elder game plans in detail so that it's not hand-wavey answers.

**Q: Can you have numbers in your name? What about special characters like spaces or dashes.**
A: At the moment there are numbers allowed in the names, not special characters.  There's some debate on our beta forums from RPers about whether it's better to have them so that Mechari can have more robotic-style names or remove em so l33td3wd doesn't exist, so opinions welcome.

**Q: Seeing some of the early beta footage from PAX, I've noticed there's a limited skill-bar with maybe 8 skills. An attraction to some other MMORPGs is that there is a variety of ways to play your character using a lot of skills (extra skillbars, many abilities...). Is Wildstar keeping its current ability limit of 8, will it increase, and what are the development decisions behind this?**  
A: Yeah, that caused a mild kerfluffle in the CBT1 Patch notes.  Here's the intent:
The limited bar mentioned there is actually class skills, not path skills, temp skills, mount skills, class specials, etc.   We reduced the number of abilities IIR in those notes to add more Path skills (but my brain is fallible)
Our goal is to support as many abilities in the LAS as a skilled player can use without custom hardware (30-button mouses etc).  It turns out that while dodging, facing, strafing, moving, jumping, etc. we were finding super low numbers of folks using even the upper ends of the bar.
So...will it change?  Probably, we need a ton more testers in and specifically we need high end raiders in saying when it's enough and not too much, and we need to gather data.  So I don't know which way it'll change (history dictates probably allowing more abiltiies to be used, either through unlocking via the elder advancement system or otherwise so people can tune the way they want to play, but data and feedback will drive us (as through most things).

**Q: My question is more on the business side of Wildstar's development and Carbine Studio's creation.  It has been repeated multiple times that many of the developers that worked on Wildstar were former Blizzard developers.  And there has been comparisons made between Wildstar and WoW.  As somebody who greatly enjoyed WoW for many years, I'm not disappointed what so ever by this.
I would like to know who came up with the idea to start Carbine Studios. Additionally,  who had the vision and led the charge of getting Wildstar developed?
Second question: So many games seem to release unfinished products, with the idea that they can patch them up in the months to come.  However, you guys have stated that you will release Wildstar when its done.  This is GREAT news for us gamers.  I would like to know what sets you guys apart to give you the freedom to release a product when you feel its done, as opposed to games like Warhammer Online and SWTOR which were launched with a myriad of issues.
It feels like, with other games, their management (or publisher) dictates when a game is to be launched while with you guys, it seems like the developers have the final say.**
A: The team was originally formed of about 20 seniors and leads off of the World of Warcraft team - but since then (we're now many years later and more like 220 people and growing) we have folks from EQ1/2, CoH,  Dark Age, WAR, and probably most of the other western MMOs big and small.  And a good crop of noobs on their first MMO too (new blood is good too).
I was the executive (VP Product Development) on the NCsoft side who signed the team initially (with Robert Garriott, Richard's brother).  I actually retired for a year and they gave me a call because they needed exec help and design help and I have a background in both.  One of the bennies of being a VP/PD of a big company is that you know pretty much all the games in development (little games want funding, and we're a cash-rich company, and big games want to go to Korea with a major partner) and honestly this was just the coolest project in the industry in my mind, so I joined here fulltime 4-5 years back or so.
Anyhoo I'm as senior as it gets in Carbine.  Within NCsoft I report to our CEO and our Global CEO and they are both gamers, so making sure the game gets backed by NCsoft is a matter of making sure it's actually fun and have 'em play.

All i've seen in recent games is you have to be in raid to get the loot, now while this seems pretty straight forward there are a few issues with it.


For starters what if you have a few extra people in your guild to cover no shows, etc ( since you guys opted for 40 mans, there WILL be extra's) and because of this one night there are quite a few on and since you've been raiding none stop and a few of you have a decent chunk of the gear they ask some to sit to spead the wealth. All good and well right? Only to have a piece of gear drop that - as luck would have it- is the one piece of gear you haven't got that everyone else has. Now what? 


Say what you want at this point but thats really damn annoying. I've had that happen before and then never seen that piece of loot again.


Those also the argument of opting to sit so other people can have fun raiding, while you stay online incase you are needed and again, because of your prior contribution the guild, attendance, etc shouldn't you be able to join the DKP bidding war still? *Slap* That's right, you are outside the zone so no longer important. Well darn.


Also (and this is more aimed at Hardcore, cream of the crop guilds) what if your guild keeps killing raid mobs, the same stuff keeps dropping and no-one needs it? In EQ2 we used to sell it off for alts at a discount rate, people who were interested would bid, pay upto what you are willing (plat or dkp) winner logs out, logs in on alt and collects loot. 


If no-one wanted it on their alt, we'd sell it off in public channels.


We'd still have a reason to raid because the plat made would be distributed throughout the guild, which in turn was used to buy better adornments, spell upgrades, rare epic drop only mats, etc. So it was all still very beneficial.

From an alt point of view it was pretty awesome, i mean who doesn't love gearing an alt out and simply enjoying it?

If I place a circut in an item, does it now become locked? Or if it's removable, does it still destroy the item if i take it out?

I know that there is nearly no info on the settler path, but this one interested me, especially because this planet is said to be unsettled.

So I would really love to see that players (maybe especially settlers) start to create a small settlement at a crossroad which other people add stuff to so it might develop to a major city.

Imagine a small settlement like goldshire in WoW becomming a big city of the size of Stormwind, with big ""milestone"" buildings or such that need everyone to contribute to its creation (like a cathedral). I would even like it if people could get their player houses there - think of it as someone starts the settlement with a small player house, a bank and some crafting hubs. Over time people start to add other important buildings (e.g. auction house, taverns etc.) and the town develops, the craftings hubs get moved to a different spot to improve efficiency (smithy next to an ore mine, some fields a little outside the town with barns or w/e and so on). So in the end we have different quarters where people who were quick enough have their player houses.

Even more awesome would be if the enemy faction could raid cities and destroy stuff that need to be rebuild and fortifications added (e.g. big walls).

This will probably be a very difficult thing to implement because how will size be restricted, without limiting the players too much. Without restrictions cities could become too big though which could result in whole areas being a big city.

Well, this is just something I thought of when I read that there will be a settler path. But this is probably too sand-box-y

The 2 Archetypes coming will be 
Tank/DPS and Healer/Dps roles

For my first I stepped out of the box and went with a Ranged Tank since both the Warrior and Stalker are already Melee DPS/Tanks.

**Weapon** - Rifle?/Rocket Launcher?/Tech Gadget(Something like NES Power Glove)
	     Think I like the Glove Idea the most
**Skills**

* Plasma Rope(Tether, Pull) - Blue Digital Plasma Look to it that comes out of the weapon, Cowboy Wrangler Style!!

* Overshield(Reduce Dmg/Absorb Dmg) - Either Permanently Active Once Switched on but you do less dmg and gain aggro easier/ Or as an Active Skill with a CD Orrrrr could be the main feature of the class When used it affects the abilities of it's other skills

* Discharge(Looks like an Explosion of Electricity) - An Intterupt Skill does some damage, If used while Overshield is Active (Overshield Ends) it becomes a AoE Stun.

* Aoe Snare Type Move (Your Weapon looks like its Malfunctionning then explodes with plasma blobs flying around) - Blobs drop on the ground and has a Stacking slow/dot debuff as enemies run through them.

I'll keep adding to this once I think of some more stuff but this is just me having some fun with ideas, please join in on the fun I'd love to hear what others will come up with.

My views of a subreddit community:

* Let you all moderate each other.
* Let the moderation from me be light.
* Any large fad going on in the game will be condensed to a single subreddit post rather flooding the place with it all. :P
* Upvote and downvote what you like and dislike, this isn't a karma whoring sub-reddit. 
* Treat others how you want to be treated; if you post like a dick you deserve the repercussions from the rest. I'm not removing stupid from the subreddit unless someone decides to spam NSFW stuff here. ;)

1375895822.0,4,self.WildStar,1jw86x,"What do you think about the ""random elements"" devs revealed to be in raids?",koticgood,7,3,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1jw86x/what_do_you_think_about_the_random_elements_devs/,"So, when asked about a question about raids, Jeremy Gaffney mentioned that there would be random elements to raid encounters, such as a situation where a boss encounter might spawn with 0 healing adds, which would make the fight significantly easier. This would be on a week to week (or however long the raid reset cycle is) basis. He mentioned that during a particularly difficult week, maybe only a few guilds could conquer the encounter, whereas during an easier week, most guilds could do it, but the top guilds would still be able to compete to see who could do it the fastest for extra loot.

Originally when I heard this, I was really excited about the idea of raid content not being completely static, and adding variety/flavor each time you enter a new raid week. Lately, with all the WildStar hype, I was reminiscing about WoW, and watched a lot of the famous world first boss kills, and thought about where and how WoW went wrong with raiding.

One of the major downfalls of raiding in WoW, in my eyes, was 10 man raiding and heroics, and later, Raid Finder. Not 10 man-specific raids, like Karazhan (or the 20 man raids in Vanilla), but 10 man versions of 25 man raids, and heroic versions for 10/25. All of it is good for having more people experience the content, but at the cost of the content's integrity.

Look, for example, at Kael'thas/Lady Vashj from TBC. They were both available at the launch of Burning Crusade, on January 16th, 2007. Yes, you had to attune for Karazhan, clear Karazhan/Gruul/Magtheridon to attune for SSC/TK, but even with all that, the first boss went down in TK on March 11th, and Kael'thas didn't go down until May 25th. First boss in SSC went down on February 15th, and Vashj didn't go down (legitimately, she was buggy =p) until May 5th. Similar story for Kil'Jaeden in Sunwell, with the first boss in the raid going down exactly 2 months before Kil'Jaeden. Those are world firsts. Expand that timeline much more for normal guilds to take down these epic bosses. Illidan, Archimonde, Kael'thas, Kil'Jaeden; these are all extremely big characters in the Warcraft universe, and the encounters presented in WoW did them justice.

To me, there is something really cool about a boss existing in the game world and constantly beating back players until being finally taken down. Hell, even back in EQ, when I was in middle school and had no idea what I was doing or what raiding even was, I remember when Trakanon first went down, there were parties and shit to celebrate.

That feeling is lost when you make trivial versions of the encounter for the sole purpose of having people experience the content. At least the Lich King on normal was slightly difficult. But even then, it cheapened the world first heroic kill (one of the best boss kill videos), because the Lich King had already been killed countless times by countless players in Azeroth. Even worse than Arthas, however, was Deathwing, who was patched in simultaneously with the Raid Finder, allowing anyone and everyone to mindlessly slaughter Deathwing one week (they held the encounter back a week from raid finder, lol) after his release. Literally anyone could just go kill Deathwing, father of Nefarian and Onyxia, one of the 5 dragon aspects, leader of the Black Dragonflight, central villain of the entire Cataclysm expansion, reduced to Hogger. Regardless of whether or not the heroic version was worthy or not (I had quit by Cataclysm, but a lot of people say heroic Ragnaros was pretty epic) is irrelevant, as the mystique and epic quality is completely removed by easy-mode versions of the same content.

So, after all that rambling, my question is, is the variety/innovation of random elements in raids worth having boss encounters trivialized when the randomization makes it very easy?",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,explorer,True,t3_1jw86x,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1jw86x/what_do_you_think_about_the_random_elements_devs/,

In the patch notes (http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/welcome_to_cbt3_ready_to_rumble.php) they mention the ability to make a list of rivals from the opposing or same faction.  They'll be given a unique visual representation.

What we are left wondering is are their limits to this and will it promote griefing?  Will the visual representation be enough that we can spot them from a distance and chase them down or more of a if there is a pvp fight you would be able to recognize them without having to read nametags above the characters?  Also cross faction communication, it makes sense lore wise, but do you feel it strengthens or weakens a community?

I'd love to hear some discussions on the merits and limits the community feels this feature needs.  I'd hate to find out that the current implementation results in lots of griefing and it gets tossed rather than retooled.

Personally I have fond memories on Tallon Zek in Everquest talking with opposing guilds.  We knew who our rivals were and in some of the mass multi-guild battles it would be nice to be able to pinpoint our favorite target and smack them around a bit.  I'd like to see maybe a brighter nametag or a bolder print for a rival in game, such as that you can see an enemy player in the distance if they are a rival the nameplate will be a bit more distinctive but offer no advantage as to seeing enemies earlier.

I could see rivals being used in a reverse situation where players would rival a griefer to try and give them a heads up that they are coming.  This could especially be the case if the distinction a rival has makes them easier to spot at a distance.  Hopefully none of that is the case or it would become mandatory to rival most players.

1368712970.0,2,self.WildStar,1eg8ch,Opinions on Potential 'Unique' Loot,clisby,7,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1eg8ch/opinions_on_potential_unique_loot/,"tl;dr: I think randomizing size, colors and particle effects (perhaps minor stats and on-hit behavior) on loot can add some very welcome variety to appearances.  For example, two of the same super-epic-awesome swords from the same raid could each be different -- with any amount of differences such as one has an electric visual effect, the other has a black particles floating.  One could have an on-hit chance to zap and the other could have a chance to slow movement.  One could have blue highlighting and the other red.  One may have a small, near-negligible +1 to strength and the other +3 vitality relative to each other.

I haven't been able to get too much into GW2 lately but started playing some yesterday.  I noticed a few guys at the dynamic event that had some extravagant, odd looking armor and I became much more interested in getting to level cap and getting some cool-looking gear.  Their gear looked nothing like each others, even though it was fairly obvious they were in end-game gear and of the same class/weapon.  

The reason I mention small differences such as size, color, particles and on-hit is they are fairly easy to implement from my limited game-dev experience(XNA, Unity).  This opens up the variety of loot greatly with very little investment.  I like uniqueness, it would reeeally get me motivated for the 40-mans.  It can also increase the replay value as many people feel obligated to get that piece of gear that is just a little bit better, different or neato.

I still remember being deflated back in WoW when I got a super-awesome drop at the end of a raid, only to go back to Org and see two other guys with the same thing.

While on uniqueness, I think adding the ability to purchase/earn different coloring/effects for class abilities would be neat too.

Does anyone else have an opinion on loot variation?  Different methods of easily implementing variety?

--------------
Since the Carbine folks seem to read these forums and there were very good comments, I'm going to paraphrase the points from the comments up here for ease:

*Too many RNG loot elements could be overwhelming

*""Flair"" effects would be a good niche role for crafting

*Epic, end-game items need to be distinguishable. Too much random could keep it from being obvious.

*Some would rather not sacrifice noticeable performance for varied visual effects

*Could cause some to roll need on an item just because of its looks, to the detriment of someone who really needs the item

*It would be a bummer to get an awesome drop but not use it due to appearance -- transmutation ftw.

---------------
EDIT: Gaffney has spoken on this:
How about gear?

We think it's funny that you end up seeing lots of people standing around town with the same gear on in the endgame. The greatest differentiation should be at the high level. For us **that means randomized elements on equipment**, customized gear, and points that unlock powers to make you different than the guy next to you.

Was hard to keep two copies in sync, so below is just the legacy points now.

*****


To me one of the fundamental aspects which keeps a game going, is the social aspect - you find friends, enemies and idiots along your path.

In several games i've played quite often i would log in to do something, and just land up spending my time chatting away with people and having a great time. However, after playing many MMOs, I find that there is  a distinct lack in tools really that help you keep the social aspect in line. Some games have some tools, some have none, and some ofter a poorly designed set of tools that really helps noone - just the tagline  on the game ""LOOK! Our guilds have shiny tools!"" So I figured i would offer some ideas and considerations, and adjust them based on comments and feedback, and perhaps! by some miracle a dev might pass them on to  the social team in the game. Not saying my ideas are the ultimate ideas that MUST be implemented, rather they are mine (and the commenters below) ideas on what makes social interaction work better.

There are 2 important parts to this: General Play and Guilds (nomenclature might change per game, but you all know what i mean). Now many games have some aspects of whats listed below, so just bear  with me.

******

@
###GENERAL PLAY 
@

**/ignore or /ignoreaccount**

Automatic timestamping and easy commenting are critical i believe. Now some games do this, but i find the biggest issue here (and silliest) is that it can be hard to actually put that information into the tool. Make it simple. Players on your ignore list should also be excluded from teaming up with you in random LF dungeons and such. 

Further, this should be broadened to account wide. So when someone spams you from one throwaway, you can ignore the entire account. There would need to be some interesting programming on this issue to ensure that the person doing the ignoring does not actually have access to that ignoree's account name (which is often their login info), and that should that particular toon be deleted, the account ignore should remain somehow. Perhaps a legacy line in the ignore list. Something along the lines of: CharacterName | Datestamp | Reason (and then should that toon be deleted, the charactername in italics). Either the server can track the backend of those legacy ignores pretty easy, or the client can (which is probably better for overhead).

SUGGESTION: /ignore NAME &lt;reason&gt; 

RESULT: The entire account of NAME gets added to ignore list, its timestamped, and the reason (editable) is posted next to it.

**/reportbot**

Spam, leveling bots, farming bots, etc.

SUGGESTION: /reportbot NAME &lt;OPTIONAL COMMENT&gt;

RESULT: The entire account of NAME gets added to ignore list, its timestamped, and the reason (editable) is marked automatically as ""BOT"". The account is then flagged for GM review if enough people report it.

**/rate /karma /dogma**

From a skill perspective - being able to give a player a ""karma point"" or some such based on good play. And of course, ""dogma point"" to the poor players. Especially with cross-server LFG, this might land up being a really useful tool. *The results from this would be visibile to other players. * These scores would normalize over time.

And yes,  i understand there are obvious ways to game the system, but surely with a non-trivial account process (requiring real accounts to be used to affect this rating) it would allow for some sort of control. Also,  scores would normalize over time, allowing players to recover from abusive bumps. Having a skill rating is actually a social issue, as poor play can ruin gaming sessions through the ensuing waste of time and drama it can cause.

From a social perspective - when you come across many players in the game, you spend time with them, level together, and then often just move on. You meet them later in the game and have a vague suspicion you might know who they are, but  you cannot be sure. And of course this works both ways - it can be a good or a bad past experience. What would be nice would be a way to keep track of such simple things in game to help in the future. A simple 1 -5 scale would work nicely. 1 being an ""avoid"", with 5 being ""helpful"". The end result is that anytime they chat/whisper in game, their name is highlighted in some way accordingly. Either a  (1)-(5) at the end of their name, or their name is color coded (red &gt; green) depending. This allows for instant recognition and building of a better social base.

This is purely a personal viewpoint of the player. *None of this information and ratings get shared with the server, other players, guilds etc.* These scores would normalize over time. This would give players a chance to reform.

Of course all of this would be on a toggle to view or not. My personal preference is their social rating to show in their chat stamps, and their skill ratings to show up under /who.

SUGGESTION: /rate NAME (1-5) || /karma NAME || /dogman NAME

RESULT: NAME gets added to your social list, its timestamped, and their rating/action is shown.

eg. BARRENSCHAT: FrodoLegolas(2): Snarf.

**/callGM**

Something as simple as this that would highlight public chat and ping a GM to look at it. So much extreme anti-social behaviour goes by because players know no GM ever looks at public chat. Perhaps if there was a  threshold - 10pings in 5 seconds - or some such, it would not be the insane resourse hog it could be. It might even foster some more tolerant behaviour amongst the kiddies if they know GM's might actually show up  and pay attention. Note that this function would be purely for chat offenses, not for support tickets or such. There could be a limiter on it for each player - can use /callGM once per day or something.

******

@
###GUILD
@

**Information**

Every game with guilds has some form of a Information field. Guilds pack all sorts of info into this, most of which would make far more sense in separate fields. This allows a guild to update fields as needed  without always wiping out the OTHER information that is often there. Don't tell me you never do this - cos it happens all the time even when you are being careful.

Now some of the fields (like /facebook etc.) are optional and most guilds won't use them, but it would be nice to have the field there should a guild decide it wants to use a facebook page instead of a website.  And note that this is not for the game to spam you with, but rather an in-guild communication page.

/info /motd /officermotd

/voicetype /voiceip /voiceport /voicepass

/website /facebook /twitter

**Comments/Crafting**

Adding a column for what craft/level a player is, larger fields for comments and officer comments. Simple ease of use stuff.

**Ranks**

Allow ranks to be reordered. Not have to move players en masse up and down. Allowing a default rank to be assigned.

**Filtered Logs**

Allow the guild log to be filtered by useful information.

BY: achievements, levels, joins/leaves, etc.

**Guild Temporary Mute**

A simple feature that allows the GM/Officers to /mute the guild (except for officers) to allow for guild meetings (or to put a temporary end to drama ensuing).

**Automatic Alt Tracking**

Have characters automatically sort in rank by their other characters. So when you see a person's name in the guild list, you could click on them, and a nested list would appear below showing their alts in the  guild. This would be a MASSIVE boon to guild management when you have to promote, demote or remove someone and all their alts. This can be taken further and have each player pick their own &lt;MAIN&gt; character  (changable of course by the player) to help ensure a lack of confusion in chatting. 

eg. Bob is online, he is the low level alt of Marcus.

eg. GUILDCHAT: Bob (a/Marcus): Hello all

******

More to come as it occurs to me.

I'm very interested in how Carbine feels regarding the comment above. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, or if there is a right thing, but I feel like they left out discussing these key features on the Uplink Analysis, which have massive affect on the community that is created.

(Further in the comments, they discuss Server wide goals to open dungeons, or Open World monsters that required Guilds to come together for the single fight.

1376683249.0,4,self.WildStar,1kibb8,Cassian or Human?,Philetic,7,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1kibb8/cassian_or_human/,"With the recent WSuplink, I was reading through some of the tweets which where chosen and it got me thinking which race I should chose Cassian or Human! For us who like to play Humans in MMOs we have a clash over the two factions! 

__ 

To clarify I want to go over some of the lore. Feel free to correct me on anything which I may get wrong as I'm not so ""hardcore on the lore"" but I've read what I can. 

Originally all ""Humans"" where Cassians as they all lived together on planet Cassus. Until harsh polices where made which caused civil unrest leading into a large part of the population rebelling against the Dominion. ( http://bit.ly/19yswAk ) This rebellion eventually lead some of the Cassian people to flee the planet Cassus and seek help to fight the Dominion. Thus we have the Exiles. 

This makes the Dominion out to be the ""bad guys"" and the more evil of the two factions. As is the way with a lot of MMOs. I usually like to play the ""good guys"" because usually they're the underdogs and are fighting for a good cause. With Wildstar I was conflicted because originally I figured that the Exiles where the good guys who are fighting for survival from the Dominion. After reading up more on both factions I decided that isn't necessarily the case! 

IMO I think both sides have their bad and good parts to them. Trying to focus purely on the Cassians and Humans, the Cassians where and are trying to keep order and run the world for the greater good of their own race. Mechari turned up with advanced ships and weaponry out of the blue and demanded 'Cassian Sword-maiden Tresayne Toria' to go with them back to a random planet or face dire consequences. Imagine if Aliens came and took Hillary Clinton with them, it's crazy. And then Hillary's half super powered alien son came back, became emperor and we all went onto rule over most of the galaxy. Cassians where under a great threat but weathered the storm and came out on top. 

- This is where I'm unsure about, I think the rebellion happened after the Mechari came to Cassus but the timelines aren't that clear. Maybe someone knows more? -

For the Humans we know that 'as the Dominion's power grew, a number of unpopular policies were enacted that led to civil unrest.' And that it was a highly decorated admiral of the Cassian fleet who went onto start and lead the rebellion! So what policies where made to make the people go to such lengths to protest and then go onto rebel!? 

I think for me I need to know more about the reasons behind the rebellion before making a decision. And more about the leadership of the Cassians on planet Cassus before the rebellion happened! Hopefully we get to see some more lore before release. 

Thanks for reading my rambles, what do you guys think on this? and Why have you chosen Cassian / Human?

 So I was wondering if anyone knew anything about group looting. More specifically if it is individualized of if everyone see's all those fancy items drop but only one person can suck them all up.

 I think it would be cool if everyone saw the items drop and only certain people can loot it, but I could see how hectic that would be when a group has to take a cluster of 30 mobs who all drop 3-5 things. Might be harder on the computer than the fight itself haha.

I have followed this game for 4+ months now after hearing about. I am very excited for it to be released as I have been looking for a game to replace the feeling I got from playing Vanilla WoW (thru BC). After watching the videos and reading dev comments in /r/wildstar I am certain this game will restore the joy I once had for MMORPG's.

The thing that gets me most excited is the fact that Player Housing + Sandbox elements will be implemented in the game. The only thing that kept me around Star Wars Galaxies(Until SOE ruined it) was the fact that I made my own story, I made my own house, I made my own City. After seeing the player housing, warplots and these plans being used in this game, I hope the devs will use one thing that I think SWG got right: Player Housing, Guild Halls, Cities. I realize a lot of the elements that were available in SWG were mainly Sand Box oriented but I feel that guild halls, player housing, city halls, cantinas, and bases were done amazingly and really brought groups of people together and kept them around. 

This game has so much potential and I am excited to try it out regardless of the Housing + Settler situation but I hope instead of just improving existing developments and pvp elements we will be establish our own outposts in permitted areas.

1364252292.0,3,self.WildStar,1b065j,"What I would like to see brought back into MMOs, especially WildStar",sandoichii,3,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1b065j/what_i_would_like_to_see_brought_back_into_mmos/,"One of the biggest reasons that new MMOs fail is because people hit level cap and then do nothing but sit in town and wait for queue's to pop (both PvP and dungeons) until they get so bored they quit.

I think the main reason for this is because of the horrible decision most MMO developers make to put everything in instances, and make the world serve as nothing more than a way to level up in. 

Sadly, I haven't seen a game not go in this direction since EQ1.

In EQ1, there were a TON of rare spawn monsters that dropped really unique loot that people spent hours trying to get. I remember there was a 1h hammer I wanted for an alt that only dropped off of a rare spawn goblin and I had to farm the goblin camps in a cave for hours and hours to finally get him to pop.

I think it would be great to have this type of mob system in the world. Don't make it so instances/raids/currency turn ins are the only way to get good loot. Put stuff in the world that will give people a reason to go exploring in it. 

Also, make super hard zones. Going back to EQ1, there were so many zones that it was near impossible to solo farm but had great drops and xp (planes of power, before instance dungeons came out). Basically, world zones that are as difficult as instances. This makes the world super challenging, fun and rewarding, and also promotes community interaction because you will most likely have to group to farm stuff. Though with the right amount of skill, it is possible to solo farm (I remember solo kiting mobs in the PoP zones on my necro, was a blast).

Sure, you could argue that people will fight over spawn camps, but in EQ1 there were enough camps and enough hard zones that people would respect them...besides if you tried to ks, you'd easily pull aggro and die.

Haven't seen a game built like that since then, and it is a real shame. Most MMO players nowadays are too young or got into gaming too late to experience this type of gameplay. If a new game came out with a system like this, I think everyone would view it as a nice refreshing (and new for many) experience. Having games that force you into instances to get good gear and challenging fights have really set the pace for a boring experience that have little sense of community interaction, and no reason to leave town. 

This also has the added effect of killing any hopes of good world PvP since nobody bothers going into the actual world...which really annoys me since PvP is something I usually focus on.

I believe that companies should have the technology and power to build worlds big enough to accomodate large population servers and not have everyone overstepping each other and constantly fighting for mob camps. The hard part though is to make it small enough so the world doesn't feel empty, but large enough to not be too crowded. 

Either way though, if the open world was the focus for getting gear, xp, and challenging fights...people will go into it. Instances do nothing more than take people out of the world and into a private hole. A MMO focused on instances feels more like a diablo2/3 type of game than an immersive, massive experience.

At least, that is how I feel, and have felt for the past 10 years or so.

1. While offline your home will go into ""Defense"" mode
2. Since im sure there will be some sort of thief class you could have them ""hack"" an electronic door, or if you havent upgraded your home and you have a rotary lock then theyd have to pick the lock
3. Maybe a warrior class would have to bash the door down giving you a notification on your IRL cell phone (crazy idea i know)
4. If someone makes it into your home and runs off with your loot then they leave behind a trail to their own home or something (just an idea)

~~5. with the personal home idea i would really like to have a **Guild fortress**, personally i think this would be amazing~~ (reread the aforementioned post and i squealed with glee at this)
this would allow for guild on guild battles and whatnot

Right now i can think of a capture point game where each point is on a different asteroid in space and capturing certain points adds certain additions to your side in the match. Plus since the match is going on in space all of the points can drift and move around. The match would be on a 15 to 20 minute timer and at certain interval of if a faction captures  all of the point one of the bases could explode and be destroyed.

Competitive Dungeons, two teams racing to complete a dungeon first for prizes.

An example would be a dungeon that is composed of 3 sections.  Each section contains 3 distinct paths the join together at intersections. When a team enters a path, it is closed off from the opposition.  
The reason for three paths is to allow for variation.  For example the difficult and obstacles of three paths may change each game.  Further each paths could vary risk/reward.  For example one path could be short but contain a miniboss with good loot.  One path could be long but only contain trash mobs, the third could contain a randomized chance for a boost within the dungeon.  It is up to each team to decide on their strategy.  

Do they wait in ambush at an intersection, in hopes of setting the other team farther back so they can have time to take the miniboss.  Do they race through the trash mobs and hope the other team does not receive a boost?    

                                 o  start
                               / | \
                               \ | /
                                 o Intersection
                               / | \
                               \ | /
                                 o Intersection
                               / | \
                               \ | /
                                 o  end
                    
The intersections allow the teams to collide in PvP with potential mobs adding to the chaos.  To win a team must have all members within the end zone first.  

To complicate things, death would have a delayed timer and respawn would occur at the last visited intersection.  Therefore dying in PvP or PvE would be a set back and PvP zerging would not be a strategy.  To win would require skilled play and good decisions.

I think this would be fun due to the constant tension of needing to be quick at PvE and competitive at PvP.  Further by having multiple different paths through a dungeon and new opposition each time, it would keep replaying a dungeon fresh and interesting.  In the same logic that playing the same map on LoL or Dota is continuously interesting.

Thoughts and opinions?

It appears that Elder-game players may log in interested only in bettering their plot and taking their plot of land to war. From interviews it has been mentioned that plots will be integrated with guilds, and guild vs guild warfare. 

Ever since SWG I have been a huge fan of in game housing and city management. For this reason I plan on choosing the settler path. 

I want there to be a site specifically tuned to the Plot aspect of Wildstar with the goal of serving fans like myself. 

**Features**: 
- A place to show off screens of your plot. Furniture, Gardens, Weaponry, Vendors, Floor Plans - MTV Crib Style player videos. - Battle Videos, of Guild Plot PVP 
 - Guild PvP Server Rankings, Alliances... And Feats, i.e. longest standing fortress, 
 - a Wiki, tailored to plot upgrades, vendors quests
 - community plot forums, news.. etc

(not sure how to get bullets to work, for feature section)

So I decided to start one, and could use advice on exactly where to go with it.   If anyone specifically wants to join the team and contribute, feel free to send me a message.

However, I haven't been able to locate speculation in relation to my concern derived from this, so hear me out.

The scary thing about 1Wt/C is that it might mean 1 playstyle per class. At start, like the first phew 20 levels when everything is new and shiny this is completely acceptable, but after a while it gets to the point where the feeling of being stuck to the same class until you get an alt is unbearable. 

Take Neverwinter for instance. Guardian Fighters are basically warriors stuck in protection speck as shield and 1 hand weapon for the entirety of the game, where Great Weapon Fighters are warriors stuck in 2 handed weapon spec.  Yes, you can tweak talents and what not for more dmg into one area, but it is always the same damn style of combat and that gets old. 

TLDR:

So what I'm asking is whether you think 1Wt/C = 1 Playstyle per Class or not? and if it does, how can we communicate this concern to the devs.

Am I the only one who gets annoyed when Crafting needs higher level items as you skill up and then you never use lower level items anymore. Like in WoW for example in WotLK you would only need Frostweave while levelling your profession after 350. Or to make my opinion clearer: You would only need materials only from the zone you were in. 

MMO's should encourage people to travel and explore. Like when you're max level you could need a really rare ore/herb/leather from a starting zone. And also the Market (Auction) would be always fresh and so. Epic Crafting Gear would make you travel all around the place so you really deserve them. Like you could also need stuff from dungeons, PvP and stuff too.

The world is looking good from what I have seen in trailers etc, but what if they are going down the traditional level restriction route? 

The fun thing about truly open mmo's like guild wars 2 (open in the sense of you are not restricted plus content is not based on a straight level progression path) is wandering into areas too high or dangerous for you and fighting through them. Secondly, the other aspect thats great is content being spread out instead of linear.

I see a lot of mmos that are great but...once you outlevel an area you never go back, theres little point to that area anymore. Are WildStar going to do the same? I sincerely hope that dungeons and hidden bosses and all sorts of cool stuff will be spread out in the world.

Linear level progression is dull and boring. Please bring on the Level 40 dungeons hidden in level 10 areas, or Level 60 world bosses hiding in a starting zone, etc.

Yes I am aware of the problem that low levle players may encounter (and then have trouble with) them but would you rather we have the same, tired and used progression through content of 'Gain levels do quests move to new area. Rinse, repeat. One at max level, sit down in max level zone and never leave it.'

The goal of this is to get as many leveling parties prepared for release and hopefully a guild that will come together and make WildStar as fun as can be. It is important to remember that pvp will also be a viable way to level so if you're looking to level through bg's you can find permades as well.

The Nexus Telegraph actually prompted this post and I got a bunch of ideas from what Eliot posted there:


**From Nexus Telegraph**

*""Of course, in the real world people don't fly everywhere because you can't just land anywhere or take flight on a dime. If we as players have access to flight in WildStar, it should have the same restrictions. Your flying shuttle needs space to land and time to lift off, and it shouldn't be immune to wear or damage. In hilly territory, you might be better off taking a ground mount because there's nowhere to land that hovering beast outside of a handful of ports. It should provide recon opportunities, definitely, and some speed increases, but flight should never be trivial and easy.""*


I posted a sort of mish mash of ideas in response on the website but I wanted to organize a few of these thoughts here and talk about some pros/cons of flying and things that can be done to solve these problems and/or alternate solutions:

------------------------------------------------

**Flying**


**Pros:**  

 - It's fun!

 - It allows access to cool areas and some great views

 - Allows for quick travel to locations you've travelled through before

 - Opens up lots of cool world opportunities

 - Fits in with the idea of a Space Frontier very well 


**Cons:**

 - Can mess with PvP by letting people AFK in the air / escape easily

 - Trivializes jumping puzzles and exploration

 - Can make areas antisocial as players afk in the sky alone waiting for groups / etc.

 - Can break immersion if not implemented properly.

 - Can be abused to farm gathering nodes without any risk (or find nodes that are less risky)


 
If you have anything to add on the pro and con list, feel free to add your thoughts too.

-----------------------------------------------

So, solutions, additions and ideas to the flying concept:

1. **Gliding**:  Players would have to jump from high locations, making exploration necessary and actually puts emphasis on Jumping puzzles.  Also makes AFKing in the air impossible.  Can even have pockets of rising air to extend flight time, and gliding puzzles throughout.


2. **Fuel Restriction**:  Gas tanks, flying dragon food, etc.  What this does is make flying a cost choice.  If you want to fly you will have to judge if it is truly cost worth to do so.  Also a nice gold sink.  Also removes AFKing in the air.


3. **Landing Pads**:  Adding launch/landing pads in towns, cities, housing plots (if non instanced), and having them made by settlers would allow only certain areas to be landed in. Landing outside of a landing pad would crash land your plane damaging it.

____3A.  **Alternative Idea:** Launch Pads and Landing Sequence: So, instead of landing pads being the only place you could land safely, an alternative idea would be to have Launch Pads being the only place you can take off (in towns/cities/etc) and have a landing sequence which requires a wide, flat area in order to land. This would make flight more than a glorified taxi service by allowing you the freedom to land anywhere that is a wide open space, but doesn't allow you to land on top of mountains or in narrow spaces (which they can make for jumping quests). This would allow more freedom without making it so you can take off from anywhere. (Except with the use of the Skyhook).

4.  **Aircraft HP/Durability**:  Adding a HP/Dura factor to aircraft would be nice in conjuction with a system that allowed air combat, crash landings, etc.  Crash landing your plane would allow you to land in an area not designated, but you would have to dish out cash to repair it later.  Do it too many times and it breaks and you have to really dish out cash to repair it.  

5.  **Aerial Combat**: Playing on the HP and Landing pad ideas, this could open up some amazing PvP options with air to air combat, destroy the other plane and send the other faction crashing to the ground / parachuting without a plane and with a heavy cost to repair their craft.  

6.  **Air Beacon**:  (credit to francis775)  Every 30 min to an hour you can call down your craft to your location and beam/hook your way up to it (THINK HEARTHSTONE).  Probably would have to be used out of combat, and have a long cast time to avoid it being abused in PvP.

7.  **7.Ship Building Mini Game:** Added this one on the end because it would tie in really well with the above ideas. Basically you construct your aircraft from parts crafted and gathered across the world to make a custom vessel. Combined with air combat you could mount various weapons, flight systems and armors to truly make your own personal intraplanetary combat vessel. I'd imagine the parts would be expensive which would make aerial combat dangerous and exciting.


------------------------------------------


These are just a few of the ideas that have been accumulating in my head reading over discussions about flying.  If all of these were implemented it would make for one really awesome system in my humblest of opinions.  I know that Carbine has stated they are considering all the options, but what else do you guys have to add?

While WoW seemed to add Flying mounts later on, like Eliot said, Wildstar seems to have the perfect start for making them a core, synergistic part of the game.

I just wanted to share some of the ideas I had, I know there have been a few posts like this, but what do you guys think?  I think Flying Mounts could be really damn awesome, as long as they aren't chucked in WoW style and are thought through.

______________________________________
**TL;DR: Flying mounts could work, but there are pros and cons and some things that can help fix the cons are:  Gliding, Fuel Cost and Landing Pads/Aerial Combat/Aircraft Durability.**

So far everything I hear and watched has turned me (overnight) from keeping my eye on this game to I wanting to throw my money at Carbine. I'm now sitting here wanting to know what features will help me play with other players. For me MMO have always been a great way to play with friends and people ive meet through gaming but as the years go on and I switch between game I found that I’m never really meeting new people in the games I’m playing just playing with the same people I always do. 


So let me back track in time abit. Back I the day when you wanted to join a Dungeon you use to sit in general chat spamming LFG and then LFG Q was invented to get rid of all the spam and make everyone’s life so much easier. Then SWTOR came out without said feature and everyone felt like it was so far behind times. Now days we are still spamming ""Looking for Guild"" and many years have past and the whole concept is scary that nothing better in social features have came out. Now the last thing I want is facebook in my game (please god no) but with the promise of 40 man raids for the HARDCORE, really fun looking group stuff and PvP, Im really hoping to find a good size guild but I want to know how. Will it be posting on a forum then signing up to their website to write an essay about my past gaming history where I start to feel like I’m applying for a job. I fill in all the paper work wait for my interview and the first time I “play” I feel like I’m on trail so I’m not having fun just worrying that my internet doesn’t cut. Or I create a character and get spammed with guild invite requests with no information to help me make a choice end up in a guild and never use it. 


So with this I hope WildStar will have something in mind. I think guild advertising in game is a great way of achieving this. Adverting space for guild could be made available and recruitment systems to help players find guilds that play the same time periods as them self on the same day with the same interests. Whatever systems are in place I'm hoping to see something’s that really helps players find that guild and for guilds to find that player.


Just not facebook or Match.com for guilds ^^.

I was instantly reminded of vanilla WoW and all the good memories but then I also started thinking how 40man raiding will influence game/encounter design and how it will affect the rest of the game.

It is obvious they are trying to appeal to the old school WoW crowd, they even said it themselves which is not a bad thing, but if that's the only reason why they are bringing out 40 man raids I am kinda concerned.

Let's look at vanilla WoW, basically the game was in its early stages, encounters were new, it wasn't as polished as it is now and whether people admit it or not what made those encounters challenging wasn't the boss mechanics, it was trying to organise 40 people and coordinate them.

As WoW evolved raids allowed the players to focus on mechanics of the fight rather than have to worry about getting 40 people together, which directly influenced encounter design... in a good way imo.

It's been years now and vast majority of players are used to not having to spend too much time organising a raid but working on bosses.  I myself did enjoy vanilla but past is in the past and if you try to recreate something it's not gonna feel the same.  Of course the 40 man raids will appeal to the minority just like they did in vanilla WoW and a lot of people are gonna say 40man raids were the shit they felt epic but think about it objectively. What will that mean for the game tho?  Are we gonna see a large number of people just stop playing resulting in wildstar's failure?  I hope not, but it sure does feel like the 40 man raids will be a major cockblock for the majority.

Of course we haven't seen any of their encounter design yet and these are just my initial feelings on the matter.

If you get killed by a zombie you in turn become one. The game continues until the last player gets infected. Standard slayer kill count to decide the ""victor"". You start off wearing some form of blue johnny, that gets ripped and bloodied when you get turned. 

I personally think it would be fun to have a BG where you don't actually use your classes abilities. Instead Infected players have a vomit ability, Leap, Strangle... you get the idea (vile, supernatural abilities) All I could think of for non infected players was some form of flame thrower ability. 

Maybe every few months carbine could swap out an ability with something new.

But in the last few years I've been looking for a game to replace it. Mainly because I want something new to explore as I know WoW way to well and get bored pretty fast with it now. 

I'll start with saying I've been into arena the last years, mainly playing it, but PvE isnt something I'm steering completely away from. 

So my question is regarding the movement and general gameplay. 

When I've tried other games I've really missed the smoothness that WoW offers (you will know what I'm talking about if you have tried WoW). I hate that some games have abilities that makes your character stop and do an animation that interrupts your speed or direction.

Its also important that the game reacts to what I'm doing. When I played games like SWTOR and Neverwinter it felt like the character didnt want to do exactly what I tried to tell him to. Trying to explain it as easy as possible. 

If you dont get what I'm asking about, please tell me what you need explained.

Mainly I'm looking to know how the movement works, compared to WoW to take an example. 

I hope to get answers from people that have played wow, or have knowledge in what I'm talking about. 

Thanks for reading. 

ps: I heard something about there might be 2v2 , 3v3 and 5v5 arena? that would be perfect

Hope this is a game I can try out.

It sounds like their buildings will require resources to make and maintain, which makes sense, but what are the resources and how does one get them? Are there multiple types of resources, or a generic one? Is it a gauge that gradually fills up over time? Do you have to kill enemies for them, or pick them up from plants/nodes?

And the important one, are they tradeable/sellable? Does a Settler have to use resources that could otherwise turn into potions/weapons/armor, to make their buildings?

As a person who did raids back in the vanilla days of wow, I have a few questions/concerns. Any information appreciated!

First, will the raid rewards be similar to those in molten core/black wing lair? Meaning, will each boss only drop around 2-3 pieces of random loot?

-I personally hated this as it could be a solid month of raiding before I got any piece of decent gear; depending on group composition and what dropped etc.

Will the drops be some form of tokens, or specific pieces?

Have they confirmed any form of group finding tools?

Will gear be a tier system like wow?

Thank you for any answers!",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,,True,t3_1gz6nf,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1gz6nf/question_about_raid_rewards/,

This also helped to see who was actually going to make it and if they couldn't who would replace them. 

    Along the theme of calendars is the holidays in the game. From WoW you had the basic holidays like Christmas and Halloween but with different names. I would like to see completely new holidays with random dates/weeks. The other idea on this is to have liberation week/empire (probably different name) week where each faction gets their own week of pvp/pve boosts. 

   My final idea is interactive fights. This may(probably)be hard, if an enemy punches the ground you could run up his arm and attack it's face to do additional damage or receive some upgraded stats for a while. I don't mean to right click on something and have the game put you up on the monsters shoulders, I mean to use the movement and the double jump ability to self climb your way up to the top of the monster.
