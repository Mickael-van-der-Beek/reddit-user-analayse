A word from your humble Moderator...,Howlinghound,25,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatstheword/comments/wm5gn/my_goodness_how_we_have_grown_a_word_from_your/,"So here we sit at over 2k readers of a subreddit that isn't much for discussion but is as phenomenal for help and assistance as we need.

When I started this subreddit, I was too afraid to keep going back to /r/writing to ask WTW questions. Writing a novel, this situation can come up quite often, and I felt that maybe if there was a subreddit that catered solely to that single issue of coming up with that word that we try so hard to grasp, that it might be popular.

One year later, we're small but productive as hell. I've learned words that I never would have thought existed in the first place. I'm also greatly humbled by the amazing contributors who have a wealth of vocabulary stored in their minds who consistently help out around here. Please keep doing what you're doing!

Before I finish with this *Thank You* letter, I do want to address two very minor issues that have been brought up to me with you all.

*1) Jokes. Example: WTW for a woman who is constantly saying negative things? Answer: A bitch.

I can take a joke. I love jokes. But ones that didn't take very much thought just leave me with a &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;. I believe in the community's ability to moderate itself. So I'll just say this to those that detract from helping someone's request, if you're gonna make a funny, make it worth reading. Don't take everyone else's karma points and leave none to thought over the requested word. 

*2) I've been asked by a number of our members for flair for when the right word is found. At first thought I thought it was a good idea. However, I also noticed that many times a) the person doesn't even know if the word exists and b) find out that there is a better one than the one they were looking for. 

So, with that, I open the floor to any thoughts, questions, comments, and the sort. Thank you all for making this subreddit as bright and constructive as its been, and please let myself or yyiii know if you come across any issues here in the future.

Examples inside...",mirthquake,22,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatstheword/comments/175tx7/wtwf_something_that_is_both_terribly_tragic_and/,"This is the quality of a thing, event, or state of being that encompasses the emotional extremes of the human experience in a powerful, gut-wrenching way. Much stronger than *bittersweet*, *ambiguous*, *emotionally complicated*, *multifaceted*, etc. Examples can be found throughout art, both classical and postmodern. 


The final scene of Hamlet, in which Hamlet succeeds in avenging the murder of his father but also inadvertently causes the poising of his mother and himself is a famous example. From recent decades, the entire tone of Woody Allen's film 'Annie Hall' conveys this feeling as Alvy Singer's love for Annie continues to deepen but he simultaneously realizes that, due to his own neuroses, he can never enjoy a stable romantic relationship with her. I also felt the same sentiment at the end of Monty Python's 'The Life of Brian,' as Brian and his fellow condemned men, left to die on crosses, sing a heartfelt yet ultimately futile rendition of ['Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoaktW-Lu38)


The back-and-forth dance of absurdest humor and bleak existential despair characteristic of 'Waiting for Godot,' 'Catch-22,' 'Slaughterhouse-5' (or just about anything else by Vonnegut), and many of the playfully whimsical but also deeply hurt songs written by Leonard Cohen during the 1960-1970s and by Tom Waits during the 1970s-1990s  are exactly what I'm attempting to capture. You could even toss in Hunter S. Thompson's writing voice, or Shel Silverstein's - an eye for the silly and the dire, ecstatic and the seedy, life-giving and life-taking, all stacked into a single sandwich that each of us eats every day. This all-emotion seems most strongly experienced during times of personal extremes--birth, loss, failure, love attained, victory--but much art suggests that it is with us throughout our days.

I recognize that I just rattled off a list of diverse and massive texts, but by its very nature this concept is not a simple one to explain. So, what's the word?


**EDIT** - I'm pleased with these diverse and thoughtful responses. I have not found what I'm seeking, but solely in terms of magnitude. Anzahl's contribution of *tragicomic* and jonpaladin's *sublime* are the two words that, in terms of definition, most precisely convey what I'm trying to communicate. They fall orders of magnitude short when it comes to implied emotional intensity, but this may be a limitation of contemporary English vocabulary. Speakingofsegues' map of non-English words used to describe specific emotional states is a useful source, and has convinced me that the solution to this query lies outside my mother tongue.

Am I making sense? The actors in relationships – what are they called? (Don't be afraid to dive into some kind of jargon if that's what it takes.)

Great discussion so far... so specifically I'm looking for a word to use in a rather complex situation. Here's the initial use:

&gt;By attempting to describe the elusive residual impression left after several exposures to “What is an Author?” without prior analysis, the crux of this initial impression seems to exist anonymously, in and between various discursive semantic levels, and can only be realistically described by the speculative, oxymoronic sign “humble arrogance,” and any/all of its various conflicting, paradoxical significations.

At the end of the paper I volunteer an inversion of that initial ""oxymoronic sign"" with the sign ""ambitious humility,"" and am trying to come up with a word to succinctly describe it (a word that is the opposite of 'oxymoronic').

This is all probably way to impossible to do, but thanks for taking the time to read!

While it is accurate that TED talks are flawed, I think it takes the talks to seriously to begin with. The article essentially says, ""TED speakers think they are preaching the gospel, but they are not. Isn't that scandalous?"" When in reality, the talks are meant to be discussion starters, not gospel.

I still have no practical use for the word, but now it's bothering me that I can't remember it. 

It basically means the person on the receiving end of an unrequited love. e.g., In the old J. Geils Band lyric, ""You love her, but she loves him, and he loves somebody else..."" 'She' would be 'your' [word], just as 'he' would be a [word] to 'her'. 

It's not an eponym. From what I remember, it's a fairly simple word, like ""foil"" or ""shun"", and it *does not* end in ""-er"" (e.g., ""shunner"" or ""rebuffer"").

You might have heard the word [saudade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade), but it describes the feeling after having lost something. I'm not looking for ""melancholia"" either, since its more specific ... so let me explain.

I just watched the film ""5 Centimeters per Second"" and once again got this very specific feeling. It's a melancholic longing which I get for example after watching emotionally moving films or reading a great story. Usually its some kind of love story, but it can be anything. Maybe I can describe it as simultanously feeling like having lost something and longing for something which has never been there.

**SPOILERS GALORE**


So I have been reading game of thrones and I came across a theory not too long ago where they proposed that one of the characters had a ________?? In this case we are talking about a knight who is for all intents and purposes amazing at his fighting ability. His right had is very important and integral for this notion. However, during a ride while he is prisoner, someone cuts off his hand. So he no longer has this part of him that was important. So then he gets a gold hand as a replacement. His hand is a form of symbolism. A talisman or something along those lines. 

You could also put it for another character who is given a sword. She loves this sword because she is a little tomboy and her brother gave it to her. So she treasures this object with all her life force and does whatever she can to protect and keep it. A couple of books later she is forced to abandon this sword, but instead of throwing it away she just buries it. She is not allowed to keep it. She is not allowed to see it. She cannot go to find it. 

Both parts of these stories draw the idea that these artifacts carry a very important role to that character and I just can't think of what that theory/principle/word is.
