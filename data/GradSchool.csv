***Please upvote for the visibility - this is a self post and it does not receive any karma. Thanks!***

I've contacted one of the mods, /u/jonosss, and we have green light to act on a FAQ for this sub.

Thanks to all of you who put ideas into the [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EyXGYzZ273FeSNMERD1qisuszN5uG4ZS9m7VSiEXRpw/edit?usp=sharing) regarding topics you would like to find in a FAQ. I am keeping this document open for all of those who still want to contribute this way. Here is the [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EyXGYzZ273FeSNMERD1qisuszN5uG4ZS9m7VSiEXRpw/edit?usp=sharing). It's open for editing to anyone with the link.

**This being said there is another way you can contribute**. I would set up another document for those of you who wants to help creating the content. We come from different countries (most from U. S. but still) so it would be perfect if at least few of you could contribute, so that FAQ will not be a subjective, but as objective as it can. Why not set up an open document? Well, in that case it would be really hard to keep everything in a good flow without any mess. When document is closed and everyone is using gmail names and so on, it's easy to peer-review everything and discuss issues / changes. After finishing, or when we decide that we have something valuable to show, we will reformat this into a Reddit FAQ style and publish for the whole community.

**How you can contribute?** Simply PM me with your e-mail so I can add you to the document editing team.

**What I will get?** Satisfaction and incredible IF among our community. Every contributing author will be acknowledged!

Please add (or debate) anything that is helpful.

Career:

- Whenever attending seminars or reading articles, always ask yourself how new information can help you with your project. A research project is a connected series of 'ah-ha' moments. The more you have, the better your project will turn out. 

- Grad school is going to be hard. There are many months that are going to suck. Try to not get too high or low emotionally. 

- Most professors (especially PI's) are not normal people. Many achieved their positions through Darwinian fitness and had to be tough to survive. I'm generalizing, but many don't react normally to emotional situations, and once you realize this, you can prepare yourself. 

- Apply for as many grants as you can. The first few I applied for were not considered for funding, but I had learned a lot by writing them and was able to use the background info that I compiled for later (successful) applications.

- Try as hard as possible to get involved in side projects. If they take off, then you'll be there to take some of the credit. If they start requiring too much time and aren't worth it, tell your advisor that you want to focus on your main project. At the end of the day, its a way to expand your skill set.

- I have viewed post-doc positions as a part of the academic career track. If you have doubts about becoming a Prof, then you probably do not have the 'right stuff' to become one. At least consider going into an industry position after grad school and save yourself the 2-5 years that you'd spend doing a post-doc. 


Personal:

- Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. If its going to take 6 years to graduate, then you can spare a few hours a week exercising or spending with your friends.

- Results should not determine your level of happiness. Your experiment caught on fire at 5 pm on Friday? Oh well, you can at least enjoy myself for the rest of the night.

- You are not an impostor. You're there for a reason and your opinons are as valid as any Nobel laureate. At conferences, talk to people from the big name schools and you'll be surprised that you probably can swim circles around most of them. 

- Be mature if you date within your grad school program. Gossip (and people) get around.

- Remember, you're in grad school because you want a better life. Let this factor decide how hard you work.

* Every project gets a project page which can be customized for the project. http://i.imgur.com/7EcLVtd.png

There are definitely some questions I can try to answer off the bat. 

We don't deal with IP, so when it comes to disclosing sensitive information that you intend to publish, patent, etc, we usually tell researchers to use their own discretion or work with their departments to determine what's sensible. 

Our project amounts right now were intentionally low during beta, but we have a few projects in the range of $15k to $50k. We've so far funded 13 projects, and raised over $72,000 for research since we launched.

I've already posted my own spreadsheet  over there and I'll have a  cleaner version soon.  Why am I motivated to do this?

Wall of text.",LeSpoogeMcDuck,50,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gyd4t/depression_anxiety_poor_self_esteem_and_falling/,"Sorry for the wall of text but it's a complicated story.

 I am a PhD candidate in Egyptology in Australia. I would have to agree that it is one of the most niche and subjects and renders me not hire-able to many employers. Nevertheless I love it, and I have been lucky enough to be on an excavation, however getting a concession in Egypt is nearly impossible, especially since the revolution and there's a good chance that all I'll ever be able to do is teach high school.

I started off pretty shaky, not sure on methodology and how I was going to climb the mountain, so I just kept putting off any real work. Lots of reading took place, sure, however I was so busy writing an only partially related article for publication and book chapter on the same topic that I forgot to do my PhD for, ooh, a year there perhaps.

I was about 18 months in when everything collapsed around me and I had a complete fucking nervous break-down. I cried for hours almost every night, didn't touch anything uni related for months, freaked out about my insurmountable mountain of a subjective artsy-fartsy motherfucker thesis subject and ended up with a case of PTSD from seeing the immediate aftermath of a fatal pedestrian/bus accident when I stopped to help. It didn't help that I was already extremely fragile and depressed.

I ended up needing medication and therapy, something that has helped me so much. In the months after I have come to feel somewhat 'normal' again, I have come to realise that although people tell you there are support networks in place for postgrads, they are woefully ineffective, at least at my university in Australia.

I went to counselling at uni first, in which I was told that I was just stressed and needed to focus better, speak to my supervisor and perhaps move out of my parents house as it was unhealthy for me to live there with my parents and husband. I did talk a lot about frustrations of home, but I was depressed about EVERYTHING, of course I blamed stupid shit at home. At no time did the counsellor tell me that a) she thought I was depressed and b) to go to a doctor. I have recently found out through requesting my records that I was showing 'signs of depression in the severe range.' My counsellor never told me this.

After a few sessions in which I cried the entire time, I stopped going, as it was a cyclical conversation of her 'you'll have to try harder, there is no sick leave for stress' and my 'but I can't, I just can't' over and over. And tears, so much crying. I would burst into tears the minute I got there and cry until I left. I re-iterate, at no stage was I told to go to the doctor.

In the end my mother told me to go to a doctor. She has suffered from depression and realised what was up. I was staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning staring at reddit or stupid TV shows. Within 5 minutes in the doc's office I had a referral to a psychologist, and within another 2 months I was on anti-depressants and diagnosed with clinical depression and an anxiety disorder. I got 6 months sick leave, 3 months in which I was paid on full scholarship.

When I think back on the weeks I wasted seeing a counsellor from the university I am angry at the time I lost, and at the risk that she put me under. I often wonder if I had not seen a doctor for a few more months, whether I would still be here. I told everyone that suicide wasn't an option, but I thought about driving off the road every day. 

What stopped me from doing something awful to myself was my doctor, my family, and my professor, bless him, who tells me in the most matter-of-fact way 'I would not have told you to apply if I did not think you could do it. You must simply work a little each day and be happy with whatever you have done. It is like exercise, you must get back into it slowly.' Most of all I have to go easy on myself and stop berating myself for the time I've lost. It's gone, move on and do the best you can with what you have left is what I say to myself every day.

I am not saying that you should not trust the facilities given to you by your institution, I simply want to say that if any other postgrads are feeling sad more often than they'd like, anxious, or overly stressed, have feelings of self loathing or poor self esteem or feelings of being trapped and doomed to fail, YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I wish I had known how common this is, I would have sought help sooner.

Remember a PhD is a stressful thing, but it is not supposed to break you. If you think you are breaking then you need professional help, and there is no shame in seeking it.

So in the spirit of looking on the bright side, what helps you when everything just gets too much?

I find walking my dogs and ONLY focusing on them, blocking out all thoughts but them for 20 minutes very relaxing. Slow breathing, meditation and calming scented oils work a charm too. And therapy, bless that expensive therapy. Also sex.

I do not know what is wrong with me but I cannot bring myself to wrap it up and send it to my advisor. Every day I sit at home and say I am going to finish, but instead I read reddit or watch Netflix because even thinking about attaching it to an email and hitting ""send"" makes me paralyzed with fear. And the longer I sit on it, the more I'm filled with a sense of shame and failure. My procrastination is exacerbated by the fact that I don't really have a hard deadline to force me to finish since I am not technically filing until the fall, but I'm moving in a month or so and should really have everything finalized before I go. I've made multiple promises to send it out in vague ""end of the week"" timeframes that I have not carried through on. At this point I have a pretty short and concrete list of things I need to do (write three more paragraphs of intro on specific topic, add four citations, format a couple of figures etc.) but I look at this document and just think it's a pile of crap, it's obvious these projects aren't done and why should I even finish it if it will be rejected? Obviously, I should finish it and send it out as soon as possible so I have time to get comments and revise but, I don't know, I guess I feel like the longer I wait the longer I have before someone tells me I suck and I've wasted the last two years and don't deserve a degree at all. My friend wrote her MS thesis with what seemed like even less research and it was accepted so realistically mine should be fine.

I don't really know why I'm posting here other than to get this off my chest.  I know what I need to do I just... can't. I don't even know how to talk about it, people ask me how it's going and I just feel like an idiot admitting I haven't been doing anything, just sitting at home like a pathetic lump. I don't know if I need a therapist or someone to punch me in the face. Maybe both, I feel like that much of a wreck.

 the worst past is that the phd program i'm in is kind of a do-over of the stuff i did as an undergrad - it's to ensure that everyone's on the same page.   there are even undergrads in some of my classes and they seem to be doing ok.  so i KNOW that i can do this. or perhaps i simply just feel that way. it makes me wonder if my grad program is unnecessarily harsh on me or if my undergrad program was very easy on me.

i'm rather worried that the professors are regretting their decision to admit me and i somehow misrepresented myself. it's very stressful. i feel stupid and yet back home everyone thinks i am some kind of genius for being accepted where I am. 

i have spoken to two professors and will be talking to another.  but is this a sign that grad school isn't for me?  because i feel the opposite. this is the only field i want to be in and i am extremely excited over what i will be potentially doing. any advice?

I have the privilege (and pain) of sitting on the admissions committee for my PhD program this year.  I am at a large research university in a biological/biomedical sciences program that requires lab rotations.  Students are not directly admitted to labs in our program.  I'm on about application #80 of over 150, and I've started noticing themes.  Things that applicants do that take what could be a good application, and sink it.  And things people do that convince me that they not only could do well here, but even belong here.  So I thought I might put some suggestions out there that perhaps someone will find helpful.  Standard disclaimer: These are my opinions and are not representative of my program (though I have discussed this with the chair of the admissions committee, and he's fine with me putting this out there).

**Things about your Statement of purpose:**   
Your SOP should tell me at least a little bit of why you want a PhD, what you want to do while you are here, and what you think you might want to do with said PhD.  Why should we accept you to a PhD program if we don't know why you want us to spend the money to help you get it?  Along those lines, since you are applying to a research based PhD program, you better have research experience that is directly applicable to this field.  If you don't, don't apply, work for a few years, then apply.  You could have the best grades in the world, but if you don't know what it's like to do bench work day in and day out, you don't really know if you want to spend the next six years of your life doing research.  Also, make sure you tell me at least a bit about your research and how doing it has helped prepare you for grad school.   

Don't explain to me why basic science is awesome, or why curing diseases is an admirable goal.  We are the admissions committee, we do this work for a living, we already know.  Tell me why YOU want to do this research, where YOU want to go with it, and what part YOU think you might do in the future of science.  If you're not really sure, that's fine, but give us some ideas on why we should let you in over someone else who has a very clear goal in mind with earning a PhD.   
Also, don't tell us why our program is cool.  We know that, that's part of why we are here.  But please do tell me about where you think you might fit into this program.  What to work with our hot young HIV group?  Sorry, so does everyone else, and if that's all you think you're coming here to do, you best have already made contact with that group.  But if you think there are a number of labs you could see yourself working in, tell me.  I want to know that you've considered which labs you think you'd be happy in.

**About your grades:**
If your grades dropped from A's to B+'s one semester, I don't want to hear that your parents divorced.  This isn't medical school, you aren't expected to have a 4.0.  In fact, if your grades are all A's and/or B's, please don't focus on your grades at all, they are fine.  Likewise, a small smattering of C's will likely not sink you, but if you started weak, address it.  If you had a shitty semester for a legitimate reason, address it.  Then move on.

**About your CV:**
Learn what should go on a CV.  Don't put stuff on there to fill space.  Make it pertinent.  Nothing about high school.  And really learn what order stuff should go in.  Your education and research experience should be near the top.  Your work to save the baby seals, near the bottom.  Anything that can be answered by looking at your transcript should not be on your CV.  If you aren't sure what this should look like, ask your professors for a copy of theirs.  Decide which looks prettiest, and then try to emulate it.  Or better yet, as your TAs.  They'll have a lot less stuff on theirs, and might give you a better idea of what a more minimal CV might look like.

**Words and their order:**
Have someone proof read EVERYTHING you turn in, ESPECIALLY if English is not your first language.  If you are at a university/college, they likely have a writing center.  Use them.  If you've already graduated, see if you can use these services as an alumni.  If you work in a lab, ask your PI and others higher up the food chain for suggestions.  

**Letters of recommendation:**
If you are sending in more than 3 LORs, they better be worth mine time.  If you are awesome, three people should be enough to vouch for your awesomeness.  If one of your letters is from the Christian camp you've worked at, you might want to reconsider including it, especially if it is instead of a LOR from one of your research experiences.   
ASK your letter writers if they can write you a STRONG letter of support.  If they can't, you might not want to include them.  If they can't, and that seems to be a theme, you might need to address why no one can write you a strong letter, and then address those issues before applying to grad school.  LORs can make or break your application.  We are considering people who have weak SOPs, but incredibly strong LORs.  The reverse doesn't really happen.

I happily provided him with a free copy and he was very appreciative.  He later sent me a request to connect on LinkedIn, and I obliged.

I hadn’t heard anything from him for the next couple years until today when I received an email saying that because I helped him out with his thesis by providing one of my articles, his supervisor informed him that I should be included as a coauthor on one of his papers and that I should choose where to submit it for publication.  Sure enough, he attached his manuscript, and I am a fourth coauthor on it.  The paper is an experimental evaluation of a cybercrime literacy program for high school students in Nigeria.

So I’m wondering what the hell is going on?  Why on Earth would they bother to give me credit for a paper I had no hand in creating?  They want me to proof read and submit it somewhere.  It also seems weird that they would want me to decide where to submit it for review…

Before anyone thinks ""Nigerian scam"" here are some additional details-
I copied some text from the manuscript they sent and it matched nothing on the internet.  It would seem like a lot of trouble to write a 30 page paper for this.  The RTF they sent doesn’t have any scripts in it that I can find.  The scheme would also have to span the course of two years, because that’s when I first got an email from this guy.  I searched the three coauthors and they are all apparently professors/instructors in a Uni in Nigera.  Lastly, my research is in cybercrime.  They know this, that is why they cited me.  So they should know there is no chance I would be dumb enough to wire some advance fee.

TLDR: Got a request from some Nigerian researchers who want me to coauthor and help submit for peer review a manuscript they wrote that I had no substantial hand in creating.  Is this weird?

Issues:

* This is a physics lab. Each lab is 2 hours and 15 minutes long. At the start of each lab my advisor comes in and talks (preaches) to the students about how they need to read the manual and be prepared. She talks for 45 minutes of their lab time! She is not teaching them anything she just enjoys the ego boost of having the attention of 30 people. Did I mention she does this for every single lab session? She wastes all their time.

* After she leaves the students have 1.5 hours to complete a lab. Each lab is really 4-5 full length labs. (For example we did inelastic and elastic collisions on the same day. They needed to get 8 tables worth of data!) The students never finish on time. She forces them to come in later to finish throughout the week to get all the data. Some of my students have spent 15 hours collecting data for a single lab. It doesn't help that she orders all the worst equipment that breaks constantly so she can get a deal.

* Another problem I have is that each lab has a 60-80 page lab report. That's right! 60 pages for an undergrad physics lab! My students say this is their hardest class even though it is only worth 10% of the actual lecture grade. They spend so much time on these horrible written reports because she has a 247(!) page outline of what she expects on blackboard. I'm not kidding, every single lab turned in is exactly the same....and they are all bad!


I don't know. I feel like the students are not learning anything. I feel like I am being immoral. They are paying so much for such a shitty experience. I feel like such an asshole saying ''I guess you will have to come in for a few hours on Saturday.'' They shouldn't have to..argh. If I was a student I just wouldn't do the lab and take the 10% point loss. Some of the lecture professors actually give enough bonus so that the students who take that route can still get an A.



Any advice? I am leaning toward just not doing it and hoping I can get an RA spot soon.


I typed this on my phone. I am sorry.

I have brought it up with my department. They basically said  ""we are aware this is an issue. She came in and took charge and we let the lab situation get away from us...she has been here for 25 years...""

During the call, he mentioned that some professors in the department thought I was not interested in pursuing a PhD. I was honestly shocked to hear this because I've always been ready to participate in meetings and projects, I get my work done, and I try to stay in the lab as much as I can. He went on to say that some professors thought my hobbies outside of school (DJing) took priority over my work. I was even more shocked to hear this because I don't really advertise / publicize at school the fact that I DJ - only my classmates and the professors in my lab know I DJ, and I scaled it back to an hour or two per week during the school year (relatively normal hobby time like sports or non-academic reading).

I feel sick to my stomach right now. I've worked hard all year to pass the comprehensive exam - it's the major hurdle that prevents first year students from really starting on their own research and doing ""PhD things."" I missed a few questions and need to make those up, and after my advisor gave me some tips, I thought I was pretty close to the end, then those two bombs got dropped on me. It's like I took one step forward and got knocked back nine steps. 

Each student's exam is discussed by all professors in the department. This is also the time they discuss work ethic and the potential of the student. When my exam came up, my advisor had to call in from a conference so he did not see who it was that said I did not seem interested and that my hobbies took priority. Moreover, he could not judge the nonverbal cues to know if they brought this up as an accusation (e.g., oontzoontz isn't interested in a PhD and spends too much time DJing) or more as a question (e.g., is oontzoontz interested in continuing his PhD?) 

The one redeeming factor that came out of this is that my advisor said on his conference call that he didn't see anything from our lab's point of view (my department has 3 labs, I'm in his lab) that I was not interested in pursuing a PhD. He was not able to stand up for me more than that because he was dialed in and I thanked him for doing that. 

Now I feel like the ball is in my court but I'm not sure what to do. I need to pass the exam first - that's a given. Do I somehow prove to the professors in the other labs that I'm interested and cut out for a PhD? Do I ignore them and just keep doing my work in my lab? Should I seriously stop having hobbies outside of school? 

I want to vomit. 

Edit: my advisor and I have a very good idea of who made these comments. I've been advised to poke my head around these professors' offices more and talk about my work, their work, really anything that will show them that I want to be here, even with my external hobbies. Even though I was not instructed to do so, I have personally made it a goal to not mention my hobbies at all in school - I figure I'll play it safe for a while.

Look at what they accomplished!"" But when a graduate student excels we just say, ""Oh of course.  I would *expect* [this impressive achievement] from a *grad student*.""

So what does that mean for you, as a graduate student?  Should you seek personal validation and ignore external recognition?  Is this just a personal problem with self-motivation?

Should you just play the endurance game in mediocrity and be content to hang in there until you graduate?  Is it enough to just know that, ""I made it,"" to this point and that's good enough?

(An auxiliary edit:  **I AM MALE**)

So... I have had this professor for 2 semesters now.  I did very well in his classes, and in the comprehensive exam he graded.  I have had a few conversations with him in his office, but it's not like I spent every day in there.  He emailed me after classes let out about doing research, and gave me a problem (I'm studying math) for me to explore a bit.  


I emailed him back talking briefly about what I had (which isn't much), and asked if he would be in town.  He is spending the summer in another city about 5 hours away, but he invited me to come up there and spend a few days at his house.

I have never had a grad adviser/research adviser in this way.  My questions for you are:

1. Is this a fairly normal thing?  I want to make it clear that I can't think of any creepy sort of ulterior motive to this, but it seemed a bit out of the ordinary to go spend a few days with a guy who I don't know very well.


2.  Is this invitation likely to be more of a formality?  This professor is out of town for research in an area tangentially related to mine, so I wouldn't think there would be a lot of downtime for him to hang out with an inexperienced grad student.  Moreover, I don't really know what I would do all day if he is going into a lab or something.


3. If I did go, I worry about it being awkward.  I'm fresh out of college, and this man has kids my age.  I don't really know how to ""hang out"" with him (although this would admittedly be an excellent skill to learn, since I intend on entering the work force some day).

Sorry if this feels like a wall of text.  Your comments would be much appreciated.


TL;DR Prof wants me to stay at his house, I don't know if it's normal or what sorts of conversations I could have with a tenured professor more than twice my age that would be in any way interesting.

This subculture has never been widely surveyed before, but the data is desperately needed by a lot of academics for research purposes (including myself). We've been working on it for a while independently, and we're currently trying to get it housed at one of our institutions, including mine. We are planning to release it into the wild as early as couple of months from now.

In an earlier stage of our work we talked with a for-profit website/company that caters to this subculture about releasing the census through them (we were hoping to make the census as visible as possible), but we ultimately decided against it and wanted it to be ""pure"" research so that people wouldn't worry about where their information was going or if it was going to be used to sell them things.  I came on to the team rather late and was not there for any of this, so none of these decisions were mine, just in case you wanted to give me flack about bad judgement. 

Then today, without warning and to the utter surprise of the entire research team, this company has posted their own census. It clearly has our older, unrevised questions that we have already improved in our current version as we ready it for international release. They neither consulted us nor gave us a heads up that they were planning anything like this. They completely ripped us off.

I'm using a throwaway because my labmates use Reddit and I'd be embarrassed if they see this under my regular account name....

I am in my second year of a MSc in life sciences. I've wanted to be a scientist in this field since I was about ten years old, and it's something I'm very passionate about! However... over the last year or so, my project seems to have hit a wall. No big deal - these things happen, I know! That's science. Unfortunately, I lost a little bit of steam when my projected shifted from something amazingly interesting to more of a methods project/full-time troubleshooting endeavour. After a whole year of failed experiments, I started to wonder if I should switch fields just so I could scrap the project.  I started working mostly in the evenings, as well, because I feel less pressure to rush through my experiments in an empty lab. 

Today, my supervisor asked if I wanted to go for a coffee so we could have a chat. I was immediately nervous, and for good reason -- over the next hour, he told me he thought I might not be cut out for science at all because I have lost my motivation to overcome obstacles. He also suggested that if I wanted go get past this setback I would need to ... well, try harder, pretty much. He told me I needed to waste less time mucking around in the lab and come up with a solution to my problems, or just throw in the towel already. He asked me to let him know by the end of the week whether or not I wanted to drop the degree, graduate and switch career paths or stick with science. 

I absolutely want to stick with science! If he does not want to accept me as a PhD student after my MSc, I will seek a new supervisor. I'd rather try now and fall flat on my face than live the rest of my life knowing I came this far and backed out because of one scary conversation. However... I'm feeling really embarrassed about being called out like this. I do work hard, and wonder if he maybe underestimates the hours I rack up in the lab due to mostly working evenings... but it doesn't matter, because the results I obtain are pretty pathetic whatever way you look at it. 

I think I should take my supervisor's opinion seriously, since he knows more about my research history and ability than anybody else. Does anybody know what steps I should take to A) ensure he knows I understood his criticisms and am actually quite serious about pursuing a career in science and B) I can get through the rest of my work week without feeling embarrassed every time I see my supervisor

Hey everyone, I'm a PhD student in the UK researching in theoretical computer science (basically pure mathematics that I occasionally implement in Maple). I started my PhD in October 2011 and it seems to have been going quite well so far (some nice results and got some papers published in our research group).

I had a meeting with my supervisors this morning and they told me that I should aim to submit around June next year. This was a pleasant surprise to me (I was thinking more like December 2014) but it's also kind of freaked me out that I've only got one more year remaining.

So what should I do/plan for this coming year? I've currently got a draft table of contents for my thesis and have my lit review from my transfer report that I'll expand. I've got some results still to prove but think that shouldn't be an issue before next year. 

The thing that really worries me is what to do post-PhD. To be honest, I still don't really know what I want to do as a career - I think I want to go into industry rather than academia but I'm not sure. How do people balance finishing up with getting a job? My advisor keeps suggesting postdocs, some of which have application dates of October/November 2013... Do I want to be applying for industry jobs at the same time?

**tl;dr** - Basically, I'm just a little nervous about entering my final year of PhD - any advice or tips would be hugely appreciated!

I'm a college junior who's been thinking about graduate school since pretty much the end of my sophomore year. I've been doing some research in a psychology lab doing statistical analysis, and it really motivates me to do some real scientific work out there. I have considered some fields I'd like to specialize in and researching some schools I feel would be a good fit for me. So for administrative preparedness, I've done my homework.

but here's the catch, I'm clinically depressed. For most part I can control it but it can get a point where it stunts me from making any meaningful progress. My grades are somewhat affected, though  not as bad as it did when I first had my major bout of depression, I've learned to ask for coursework help and try to minimize the damage. I regularly see a counselor in my school to help me manage all of this. I'm also taking medications regularly. I pretty much do whatever I can to keep myself intact but you know, sometimes it just hits you really hard and I find myself unable to do anything.

Long story short, I started with two projects and did enough work in my first two years to finish my PhD in three, but took on an extra program (which I LOVE) so I will be here for 4.5.

Anyway, during my first year my PI decided I had done so much work on my side project that he made that my dissertation mostly against my will. The problem with that project is that it's externally and eternally funded by a company which has led my PI to form a collaborative project with absolutely no preliminary data to support it. They just keep sending us money which is being used for all sorts of other things too. After three years of work and lots of writing, it is clear that no one checked into our methods or other published data and we are basically pissing into the wind. I now have a year left to process samples and analyze data that I am VERY confident will yield nothing just like the same methods have yielded nothing for anyone else who has done almost the exact same experiment, including us in our previous model. 

I have very little interest in this area and I have been totally pigeonholed because I'm the only one in the lab who does these methods/work in this area. I am at the fringes of what we normally study. Lab work is at a bit of a lull at the moment while we collect samples so I feel silly even feeling so fed up with it, but it's the anticipation of the next year-long suckfest that is driving me insane.

so basically I despise him. However, my PI doesn't know or is in denial about what a pile of diarrhea he is. When I politely ask him to get rid of his culture waste, for example, he may comply, but it's usually days/weeks later and just does it again.

I love my field and want nothing more than to be able to have a decent job teaching the subject and widening students views of the world. When I was in undergrad in Richmond, Virginia (five years for two degrees, BS's in Business Information Systems and Sociology) I did well A’s in everything except programming and various economics and accounting, nothing lower than a low B. I’d have funks where I would be irritable as all hell with an instinct to snap peoples’ heads off, which I was aware of and kept in check. My close friends there helped. Then I moved to northern Virginia for my Master’s degree.

Halfway through my first semester I ended up having something akin to a nervous breakdown after severely fouling up a paper proposal for my Society and Education class because I did not know what was expected. I ended up curled in an upright fetal position on the couch with a bottle of bourbon. (I’ve since had to completely cut out alcohol, spackling walls is annoying, especially when you can’t remember causing the hole.) I managed to get through my coursework, even with last year being a year of hell with a roommate I’ll call Tan, who I would refer to as scum if that wasn’t an insult to honest algae everywhere. I was able to mostly keep it under control. Though, looking back, I can see it getting somewhat worse as last year, and my association with Tan went on. To make this worse, I’ve not been able to establish a close group of friends for support like I had in undergrad and most of those friends have gone on their ways and keep up with me online. The one person who tries is my girlfriend, who has her own issues with clinical depression and PTSD, so there’s only so much she can do for me.

It's even worse now that I'm ABT and writing a thesis proposal. All of a sudden I'm the only one expected to keep myself to task. All of a sudden the worst possible judge of my progress has become the paramount evaluator. I just wish there was something I could physically attack and get it over with. And that thought makes me remember how disabled my two ACL replacements in my left leg have made me in terms of my former skills as a martial artist and the entire thing circles around like a shark waiting to take a bite out of me. I’m not sure if this is depression,

It's been two months since I've been able to write anything without feeling akin to an utter fuckup. I’ve been periodically dropping in this hellishly negative apathy at best when whatever this is hits and want-to-curl-up-in-a-ball-til-the-world-rights-itself with the occasional dash of short temperedness on the edge of either wanting to scream or cry in the darker times. I feel rather normal most of the time but it doesn't take much to push me into a feeling of dull apathy. University counseling services didn't help since I'm rather withdrawn about this stuff and the therapist was not proficient at teasing things out of me. :( Am I alone in this? What can I do?

Same for when I'm listening to a speaker at a conference or symposium-- almost 100% of the time I can't think of any questions because it all just makes sense, and the future directions/implications I thought of have already been mentioned. Or, if I do think of a question, I think it through in my mind and realize I (think) I knew the answer all along, and it seems dumb in retrospect.

Since I'm heading to SPSP in a few days and my last, desperate chance at getting POIs' attention is likely through asking good questions at their presentations, I really need to learn how to just ask *better* questions.

I've basically given up contacting her. There is just no guidance anywhere.

Third, I feel like I am majorly faking it with my research. I'm still doing rotations, but feel like I am spinning my wheels without understanding anything or really getting anything done.

Whenever I try to contribute in class, I feel like what I'm saying is total BS or perhaps unrelated to the what other students are trying to talk about.

I feel like I shouldn't have been accepted to the program.   I do the readings, I try to contribute...but most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I find it hard to make connections from the readings to the class discussion that others in my cohort appear to do seamlessly.

I handed in my PhD thesis a few months ago. It was anticlimactic, it was the culmination of years of banging my head against walls, trying to get things done, but having to ask at least 5 different people for ""permission"". Things didn't get done in time, my adviser who was the head of the department ended up hating me, and I ended up doing a lot of stuff on the sidelines because I was terrified I wasn't going to have enough material for the PhD.

Finally the time to start writing came and lab stuff was not finished, luckily I had this side stuff which was mostly database related research which actually became one of my main articles.
At that point I was extremely disappointed, and felt that the whole thing of getting a PhD was a sham. I thought to myself if I was in the evaluating committee I wouldn't approve the thesis.

So I wrote the stuff, handed it in and now it has been evaluated. It is acceptable for defense, but the committee confirmed what I already knew: the important part of the labwork was missing, what is there, lacks originality and impact in the field. They decided that since its lacking in that area, the format needs to be perfect, so I have to move some text around, fix the references and rewrite the discussion .

I am now feeling like shit. I don't want to do anything. On top of it all I was unable to secure a position in the field after my PhD was handed in, so I have been unemployed since then, and unable to find a job, since my chances in the field are close to 0 due to the relationship with my former boss, the lack of opportunities in the area and personal situations which prevent me from moving away from the area.

I am at a loss, I am so disappointed, I am not sure what did I do wrong, if what I needed was to be more forceful with the bureaucrats or what? I feel like a loser when I see the newly published articles of my competitors, who used an older technology than I was using, but got much farther than I did and reached the goals I had intended to reach when I started my PhD.

Although all my life I have dreamt of teaching and researching, right now I feel I don't want anything to do with research (this was not my first PhD attempt, previously I had started another PhD and my adviser wanted me to change some results from negative to positive... needless to say, I got out of there real fast, not without trauma, lawyers and really bad times).

I've been looking for jobs in the private industry and presented myself well, and referred to my PhD as the next best thing after PCR, but keep getting the same answer after 2 rounds of interviews: Strong profile, but no experience in X field.

I am not sure what to do, I am terrified of the defense, I am unsure about my future. When I think ahead about getting my PhD, I feel like I would be at the pinnacle of mediocrity.

Anyone out there has some advice for me?

Anyone been through a similar situation? What did you do? What got you through?

I have not won a single award or gotten a single grant funded (not for lack of trying).

I have one first author, one second author, and one middle author publication.

Background: I'm potentially starting my sixth year in a PhD program in Comp Sci.  I'm through all of the diagnostic and comprehensive exams and coursework, and all that's left is to propose my dissertation topic to the department (when I'm ""roughly halfway through"" working on my dissertation), and then defend. 

Three and a half years ago, I got married, and (almost) two years ago I accepted a job in industry, which I work full time.  Three weeks ago my wife gave birth to our first child.

A large part of the reason why I went for the PhD to begin with was to avoid industry because I wasn't sure I could ""hack it"" (I had gone straight from bachelor's to master's without a ""real job"").  Turns out, I can hack it, and I'm damn good at it (at my first full yearly review, I got the highest possible grade).  

A secondary reason was because of pressure from my parents, specifically my dad.  I talked (well, tried to) with him recently about leaving the program and he insists that I should stick with it, in large part because HE left his Master's program with one course left to go, and feels like it haunted the rest of his life.

Before I took this job in industry, I got to be an instructor at the college level at two different universities, and though I was decent at it, I didn't *really* enjoy being an instructor like I enjoy actually working in industry, so I'm not really sure if I desperately want to be a professor some day.

But really the driving point in this post is this: I want to be there for my son as much as I can, and I don't want to let something I don't really enjoy doing (dissertation research/writing) get in the way of that.  But I don't want to hurt my ability to provide for him in the future by making a potentially rash and selfish decision now.  I've sent an e-mail to the guy in my company who fought for me to get tuition reimbursement, asking what repercussions could occur if I didn't finish the program, but I wouldn't mind crowdsourcing some opinions from people who might have seen others in the same position I am, and have seen what happened to them as a result of whatever path they chose.

TL,DR: Close to the end, not sure if I want to finish.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_1j1amg,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1j1amg/all_but_dissertation_but_thinking_about_dropping/,

I've started seeing a counselor for the depression, but I haven't felt like I've made much progress yet. I'm not taking any medication... I've thought about it, but ultimately decided against it as I'm terrified it would alter my brain in a bad way or kill my sex drive (I'm married so I don't want to make things even harder for my husband). 

Lately I can't help but feel that I may not be cut out for grad school. I initially went into graduate school for biophysics because I did think the research was interesting and I had thoughts of becoming a professor at a small liberal arts college. But I have quickly become disillusioned. There is so much politics involved in academia, so much pressure to publish as much as possible and get as many grants as possible, the hours can be unpredictable and demanding. As such, my health both physically and mentally have completely gone down hill since starting graduate school. 

I had a really bad panic attack about two months ago, and that's when I started thinking about quitting grad school. But I have NO IDEA what else I would do with my life, besides becoming a swim coach (I have been swimming since I was 5 years old and completely love it!!), but that doesn't seem lucrative or like a good long term job. I don't know what else a biophysics degree can help me do in careers. I honestly have NO idea what jobs are out there for scientists besides being a technician in a lab, which pays even less than being in grad school and has less mobility.

I'm currently finishing up my first year as a Master's student and am having doubts about whether I want to continue.


This has little to do with my academics (3.95 GPA) or research (slow, but progressing) but moreso how unhappy I've become. The department itself is very small (totaling 40), relatively new (~20 years), and the incoming students with me were 1/2 international and 1/4 PhDs with families already, the other 1/4 came from the school so they have established friends already. You can see where this is going. 


I've struggled mightily to establish a peer circle. The postdocs in my lab are 30+ and international students, the other PhD in my lab has family in this area. I've tried hard to go out and make friends; gym, basketball, grad association socials, inviting my peers for meals, but it's just not working. Coupled that with how much I dislike this area, and I'm pretty miserable. 


I can't believe I'm considering it, especially since I have at most 11 months left, but I just feel so down and get super lonely on weekends that I end up hating myself. 


I guess this was a feeler to see if anybody else on here has gone through it and decided to stick it out or just leave. I have all coursework complete so there still is an outside chance I can leave with my degree upon taking a comprehensive exam.

Just wanted to kind of vent to a group of individuals who have a clue what I'm talking about.  It is one thing to discuss comp exams and the pressures associated with them with people who aren't/haven't been grad students, but an entirely different discussion with those who have been there.

I started grad school in Fall 2010, MA in Public Policy, took my comp exam the first go-round in January 2012.  Was notified I failed in late February and it shattered my confidence.  I received very high grades in every class, had completed a successful professional paper, etc. so this came out of left field for me.

The expectations prior to the exam were vague, but with some clarification from the Director of Grad Studies and my advisor, was given a decent path to follow.  So I studied for hours on end each day through the whole semester, only to have the comp over Labor Day Weekend.  The first time I took the exam I had seven days to answer three questions of my choosing out of three groupings.  The second time it was the same format but only three days due to a change in the department for all students taking comprehensive examinations.

Needless to say, the time leading up to this I was incredibly stressed and not in a good place psychologically - a second failure of the comp exam in my program and you are dismissed.

Took the exam, washed my hands of the situation, and was told I would be notified within 30 days.  30 days passed and no information, then 45, finally 50+ days later I received notification I PASSED.

I am elated right now.  Staring down the fear of complete failure and having wasted the lat two years of my life was incredibly terrifying and I had even gone so far as to tell myself I hadn't gotten the degree so I wasn't setting myself up for a huge emotional let-down while already unemployed. 

**TL;DR**:  Failed comp first time, took second time, after sweating it out waiting for word I passed and get to move on with my life - with a Masters degree.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_ww51n,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ww51n/after_months_of_paralyzing_fear_after_failing_my/,

1323476172.0,24,self.GradSchool,n6vy0,Some suggestions - part 2,gfpumpkins,25,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/n6vy0/some_suggestions_part_2/,"I thought I'd do a small follow up to my post from earlier this week about [suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/n2ogk/some_suggestions_for_those_of_you_applying_to/) for those applying to grad school (specifically in the biomedical sciences).  Much like last time, I'd like to remind you that these are my opinions, and not representative of my program.  If you'd like more background, see the last post.

**Know your reader**  This is something that I think is incredibly important in writing in general.  Know who you are writing to.  And I don't mean this in the incredibly literal sense.  Sometimes, like when applying to grad school, you might not even know the name of who will be reading your application.  But in the case of applying to grad school, there are a number of things you can safely assume.  You can safely assume that the majority of people reading your application are professors (and perhaps a few people like me, upper level graduate students).  This means they are highly educated.  They do research and teach for a living.  And your application isn't the first they've seen.  They know science.  They know it well.  And they read A LOT of it, both shitty and stellar.  They've also heard just about every story in the book.  You, most likely, are not a unique snowflake.  Sorry.  That's life.  Odds are, you are part of the middle of that bell curve.  This is ok.  So are most of the rest of us.  We aren't going to be impressed by your pipetting skills.  A single summer of research isn't anything special.  And don't try to wow me your grades.  With few exceptions, you can assume that your application isn't going to be all that unique.  BUT what you can do is convince me that you'll be a good grad student, you'll be a good scientist, and that you'll be a good researcher.

**Don't piss your reader off**  One of my first professors here in grad school is fond of saying this.  There are many ways you can interpret this, but there are a few that apply to applying to grad school.  Please don't tell me your sexual orientation (had one of these).  Please don't tell me your religious affiliations (had a few of these), or how blessed you feel by God that your dad got off drugs (had one of these).  There ARE ways to convey the information you need to without giving people a reason to skip your application.  There are graceful and professional ways to work in that you moved to the US by yourself at 17, worked and put yourself into and through college (had one of these).  There are graceful and professional ways to detail dropping out of dental school and finding your heart in research (had one of these too).  And there are appropriate ways to mention that English is not your first language.  But don't tell me you're special because no one in your family did science and you had to find this path on your own (sorry chump, but the first paragraph of your SOP had me ignoring the rest of your application).

**Get things in on time**  I didn't realize how important this one was for my own applications.  I figured as long as things I had direct control over were in on time, and that everything else followed soon there after, things would be fine.  Here's how our process works.  Our deadline is Dec 1.  Monday we sat down and discussed the 75+ applications there were complete at that point.  We culled out the ones who weren't qualified for our program, weren't a good fit, or we just didn't feel needed to be here.  Wed we discussed the next 60+ or so for whom materials had arrived after the due date (transcripts, LORs, or GRE scores).  Today we discussed the remaining 60+ applications, both complete and incomplete.  If your application wasn't complete by today, oh well, we evaluated you based on what was here.  We culled 107 applications total.  There are some, even with missing transcripts, or ONE missing LOR that we are still considering.  This isn't a kiss of death for us.  But multiple missing items was generally an indication that we couldn't evaluate that person sufficiently, and they were put on the decline list.  We've got a working list of 84 potential applicants now.  45 will be offered interviews.  By next Monday, I'll have my list of my top 20 favorites, and by next Wed we'll have made our final list of who gets offered interviews in the first round, and we'll have a second round list so that if people in the top aren't interested any more, we can offer that spot to someone else.  People should start getting calls shortly thereafter offering them an interview slot.

Here's the other thing about being on time though.  The applications I read on Sunday and Monday?  I was thorough.  I was patient.  I was kind.  I was understanding.  The last 10 this morning?  I'm tired.  I was brutal and ruthless.  I voted to cull more people today than either of our past two meetings.  You want to be at the top of the pile not necessarily because you want to be near the top, but you want to be near the top so that you're not #180 for your reader.  It's a numbers game, and someone has to be last, but try not to make it be you.

**Spelling and grammar**  Last, but not least (again), spell check EVERYTHING you turn in.  If you have access to a computer to submit your application, than you also have access to a computer to spell check your statement.  I've read at least a handful of applications that it was obvious were not even put through one round of spell check in word.  This does not bode well for your application, especially if you're #180 and one of your letter writers still hasn't sent in their letter for you.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_n6vy0,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/n6vy0/some_suggestions_part_2/,

I am involved with various campus organizations, and I do theatre stuff around the city. I also genuinely like my dissertation and, while working on it is not exactly ""fun,"" it is fulfilling.

But despite having many things to fill my time, I am four years into my program and still feeling socially at sea. Many of my fellow students are married or living with their SOs; the ones who aren't tend to be the people who came here straight out of undergrad and have roommates they went to college with, so you can imagine what their social lives look like. I'm in my late 20s, and I just can't find a place to fit. I certainly have friends, and while I like them lots I just don't feel the connection to them that I have with friends in other places. I have no ""group."" And if I want to just have a casual last minute drink some night, nobody's ever up for it -- I ask, but they've always got other plans. I've given up having birthday parties because the results are just lame and underwhelming.

I have a strong sense of academic community, but socially, not so much. It gets lonely round these parts. It makes me worry that this is what the rest of adult life is gonna be like (whether I become an academic or not). How do I work with this? Just keep on trying? Seek friends outside academia? How do you even do that? What's your experience, r/gradschool?

The adviser says he'll sign in early August, in time for getting the degree in the fall.

So, Jim started his job a few weeks later. This job assumes he has his PhD, but hasn't explicitly asked for proof. Adviser disappears for a few weeks, and Jim has emailed the adviser to work on wrapping things up, but adviser doesn't respond.

Jim has been working this whole time at his new job, and is stuck.

I've always graded using rubrics, in an attempt to quantify and standardize a process that is traditionally very subjective. I don't like having to give poor grades, I want my students to succeed and I feel that I give them every opportunity to do so. I implore students to come to my office hours to talk about assignments, I read over papers before they are due so as to offer advice on improving grades, and I always give copious feedback to let students know how to improve on the next assignment. I'm aware of how frustrating humanities classes can be in this regard, where they are no ""right"" answers, and good grades are based on difficult to quantify rubrics such as writing ability, logical consistency, and critical analysis of sources. As a result I feel that humanities TAs are far more susceptible to bullying, grade grubbing and grade complaints. 



In previous semesters I always felt that the professor had my back, that if a student complained (and the complaint was unfair, which generally it is considering how much time and effort I put into giving adequate feedback), I could direct them to the professor. However, the professor I'm currently working with has made it clear that she refuses to ""be the bad guy"", suggesting that she will not have our backs in this regard. She also made it clear that she wants us to hold students to a very high standard when grading. Following the first assignment, I've already received one very nasty complaint from a student claiming that I ""cheated him"" on his grade. He was unable to provide any evidence of this, and considering that I wrote a paragraph of useful feedback after every answer on his assignment, I feel that his claim is very unfair. As I can't rely on the professor to support me, do any TAs here have any advice? It's causing me a lot of anxiety, and I'm becoming afraid to go to class tomorrow to face him. 


**TL:DR: What is the best way to deal with student grade complaints?**

My adviser relationship has grown steadily more antagonistic to the point where I think he is actively holding me back from graduating. I'm a 6th year engineering PhD at an ivy with one paper published and another paper ready to submit.  I was set to defend in March with 100 pgs of my thesis written already.  All of a sudden, my adviser wants to enforce a 3 papers published before graduation rule - a rule that he has not done with any of his previous graduate students. Not a single one in over a decade.  I find the requirement ridiculous because papers can easily be stuck in revision for a year in my field and would bump my total time to 7 years+.

I've gradually lost respect for my adviser.  He's pretty much not an expert in anything, but uses his position as a gatekeeper to the equipment to get his name on a lot of papers. He is on terrible terms with half the department, and they don't talk though there is ample room for productive cooperation.  I really like my research/thesis and have gotten to the point where I am independent.  In some weird way, I feel my adviser finds this threatening, which is leading him to become incredibly critical of my work.  My co-workers/authors (staff researcher and assistant professors) have complimented my work so I think my adviser's concerns are unfounded.

On this backdrop of a dysfunctional department divided in to political hegemonies, I don't know where to go for advice. I feel the science deans or department head will side with the professor. To me it almost seems like a tacit understanding that graduates students are like serfs.  I've had overall positive experiences in grad school but now the psychological torment of another year or quitting in the 6th year is starting to really drag me down.  I feel if I quit, I would land on my feet eventually due to the skills I've acquired and references from my coworkers.  Sorry about the long post, but what does reddit think are my options?  

TL;DR. Adviser has become increasingly critical of my work though coauthors approve, and I'm thinking of quitting rather than doing another year or more.

It wasn't until I got to the wash basin and saw a girl in a hijab that I realized that I hadn't seen any urinals - ""Oh shit! I was in the women's room"".

I turned to the girl standing next to me to confirm my suspicion, apologized, washed my hands and teleported out of there, beet red from embarrassment. Thankfully, nobody called the cops on me (not that I had any malicious intentions whatsoever).

I'm not anxious about the future. I've already found a job that pays extremely well and I'm looking forward to the work and its environment. I am not remotely anxious for what the future holds. I just want to know if the feelings brought on by grad school will go away. 

My doctoral defense is the end of this month and I am simply hoping that after getting that expensive piece of paper that says it is all done  that it really is all done. Is the rumor of a ""normal life"" is really just a rumor?

Don't mind my ""redditor of one day"" tag, this is just a throwaway for my own peace of mind. I have several questions which I would be very grateful if any of you could answer one or all of them. 

I've recently started my PhD, and while I was very excited leading up to it, now I feel that I'm over my head. I have my subject/topic, but I don't yet have a specific question or focus to follow and base my experiments around. I feel so stupid just reading journals trying to aimlessly find an idea to follow. This doesn't seem to be the correct way to go about this. Furthermore, my topic isn't holding my attention and I'm not so excited to learn about it.. (atm anyway). 

So...how would you go about finding you main question or focus? 
I'm worried that I am having doubts and anxiety so early (as I said in my title, for 6 hours today I couldn't concentrate and felt like I had made a major mistake). 

I don't want to waste my time here, so how can I start off my project BEST? ..What is the best way to tackle a project... 

I know that is a loaded question from all the google searches and online books I have read. 

I'm thinking that if in a few months I'm still not enjoying this like I thought I would that I may quit, but atm I want to give it my all and try my best.

I am (or have been) pursuing a PhD in one of the biological sciences at a major university (being vague to avoid being tracked down).  I super love my PhD project and other aspects of grad school and my PhD program.
This is why I regret to admit that I have to leave my lab.  My PI uses harassment and intimidation to attempt to instill control, which of course sparks fear and outrage among the lab members.  He also woefully mishandles his grants; I did not put this together until a recent fellowship submission in which I read his account of our exact funding situation.  He is unwilling to discuss science in the lab, despises collaboration, and doles out experiments and EXPECTED RESULTS hinthint to grad students and post-docs.  He does experiments, without doing science.  He refuses to read papers that draw conclusions contrary to his myopic scientific vision and mishandles the lab.
I have addressed this situation with my program director, former mentor, and the ombudsperson.  I have elected to stay out of lab until there is some resolution (???) to avoid harassment and unprofessional behavior on his part.  (My negative feelings about my PI and the lab environment have been building slowly over the past year or so, and it was only last week that I decided enough was enough.)
I am super upset to abandon what I have worked on all this time, and could use some support. 

Edit: why does everyone think I'm a guy?  Female here.

Little update: the post-doc and I met with the ombudsperson today, who was very interested to hear about the behavior/work environment concerns, many of which directly violate predetermined standards at my university.  She also described several avenues for mediating our personal conflict, including higher-ups in the medical school, graduate school, and his clinical department.  (These three are extremely interrelated at my university; I promise that it makes some kind of sense.)  She believes that there is leverage to require amended behavior on his part, and has worked with this exact situation before.  If she is correct, I would like to continue my PhD work.  If he is unwilling to work with me, I will take a master's degree and seek a clinical research position.  Next week I am meeting with the ombudsperson again as well as my PhD program director to take the next step.
I appreciate the support I am being offered here.  The ombudsperson told me that this problem is extremely common and faculty tend to take for granted that there are no consequences to their behavior.  This is not true, and several people, from the chair of the PI's department to the dean of the graduate school, have a professional investment in mediating issues.  There are enforcement mechanisms in place to handle these issues.  I am feeling confident that progress can be made in one direction or another.  I will wait to get my hopes up about finishing my PhD without walking away from the data I have generated so far.

Any advice?,sn4rf,25,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/xnoif/im_four_weeks_into_my_phd_and_having_doubts_any/,"First, let me give you a bit of background information. I finished my bachelor's in May and went straight into a PhD program. I'm in a top 5 program in my field (engineering related) and am working for a pretty accomplished adviser. I've got an NSF Fellowship so I don't have to worry about funding right now. He recommend that I come early in the summer and I've now been working in his lab for the past 4 weeks.

Ever since I got here, I've just got these nagging feelings that maybe this isn't right. It's been pretty miserable for me thus far. I'm in the lab six days a week, 10+ hours a day. AND I feel like the slacker in the group because the other grad students work more than I do. I feel like if I keep up this work rate, I will just go insane. I don't have any time for myself with this schedule.

Furthermore, I'm quickly realizing that I am just a lowly peon in the department and no one really gives a shit about me. I came to campus early on the pretense that I would be paid hourly for the summer (I will be unable to draw from my fellowship until the fall semester). However, due to an error on behalf of my adviser and my department, I have yet to be paid and I will receive no compensation or back pay for my first two weeks work. I have bugged department secretaries about this and the most I've gotten in response is, ""I'll make some calls and see what I can do."" My adviser offered me a, ""Well, that really sucks"" but didn't apologize. I feel like this is a harbinger for future not-giving-a-shit.

Finally, I feel grossly incompetent. I am already feeling the pressure of the group. My adviser wants me to make a presentation to the group next week about what I will be doing my thesis on and there is just so much that I don't know. The other grad students seem absolutely brilliant whereas I feel quite mediocre in comparison. Even the other first year grad student seems way ahead of me. 

I realize that this has turned into quite the long rant, but I really needed to get this out there. For those of you who are further along, do have any advice for me? Is this worth it? I just want some perspective on how the next 4-6 years of my life are going to be. Did you have a similar experience when you first started? Did it get better or more manageable?

(http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/rgqlt/thesis_lab_change_scared_xpost_from/)
TL;DR: thesis advisor was trying to convince me to quit science altogether on unfair grounds, didn't know what to do.

I came back to thank r/GradSchool, and to let you know that I have since found a great new lab, and that I am doing better than I ever did in the past four years. I'm in a new place where there is a real mentoring connection between the PI and the students. I no longer feel that I am an imposter who ended up in grad school by pure luck. This new lab has much less funding, but I feel like I can do a million times more here. I know that I just lost out on two years of my life, but this is my choice and I feel confident about it. Oh, and my old advisor? As soon as I was out of his way, he was extremely supportive of my move to another lab. He even recommended me to my new mentor, which is strange because I thought I wasn't cut out to be in science at all. There are more negative changes in the old lab, and my friends in the old lab feel that I got out at the right time.

Grad school often leaves us feeling like we're worthless. Well, whether it's the little voice in your head or your piece of shit advisor telling you that you are not good enough, you tell them to GO FUCK THEMSELVES.

Sometimes he says, this needs a repeat, you haven't got it right yet...he has sometimes this is a technical problem you are doing something wrong.

I have my written qualifying exams coming up very soon soon, and I am do not feel prepared. I have been studying intensely for the past two months or so, but these feelings of failure and inadequacy keeping lingering it makes the studying so much more difficult.

I recently had my qualifying exam and ended up with an 'incomplete' because my committee was not convinced I knew where I was going with my research. A few months before my talk I laid out an outline of what I was going to discuss. He liked the ideas and thought that it would be more than sufficient for the exam. Time goes by, I do a few experiments, collect some data, and start putting together what would go into my proposal document, a mandatory part of the exam. 

Other than style changes my advisor only made one comment about the direction of the research, that the future experiments hadn't been performed yet and that I shouldn't mention them. This was quite contradictory to the guidelines of the exam and I kept them in there anyway. Just prior to the exam I ran the presentation by my advisor, he asked why the slides of the future work were still here, and I told him because they were still in the paper and showed him the exam guidelines.

""Well, still change them. You need to focus on just one area.""

""But I already turned the paper in.""

""Oh... right... well... figure out how to subtly change it.""

He also revealed to me that he was so disappointed in the original paper that he wanted me to get an incomplete and that he didn't care what my committee said about the outcome, he would argue for an incomplete.

Needless to say, without getting much feedback originally, or during the project, it came to a jumbled mess of ideas and experiments. His office door was always open in the afternoons and we kept in touch, so the opportunity to get feedback was always there and I took it but he never gave any in a constructive sense though.

After my exam I got a scathing, ranting email from him and he revealed that he told my committee that I had made those changes in my presentation. At that point I realized that I trusted the opinions of the people judging me more than my own advisor and that was why I didn't make the change.

Otherwise, he compares me to previous graduate students, never in a positive light and wonders if I even have a useful idea at all in my head. It's a passive-aggressive thing and he's been very good at using it. I've spent weeks on stuff that a previous graduate student figured out didn't work and only told me afterwards with a: ""and what were you expecting? This is no time to be reinventing the wheel.""

The environment isn't healthy, he's lost more graduate students through attrition than had graduate, and right now I'm the only graduate student in his lab. We 'have' a first year but he hasn't shown up for a day of work once. I did a lot to try and convince him he was in a bad place with his work, now I know that he's just in a bad place period.

Sorry if this got longwinded, it makes my heart race whenever I think about it. There's more, there's a lot more but I don't think it would help anyone for me to pound it out.

Recently, I've been avoiding my classmates and making excuses to not interact with them, avoiding eye contact in the halls, etc. I've stopped asking questions in class, but recently made myself start again because no one else asks questions. 

I just feel myself going crazy. I'm still able to function as an island, and I'm productive in the lab, but I'm becoming paranoid about people, feeling insanely competitive and envious, and it's driving me mad

I'm not used to thinking this way and I hate it. I'm used to hosting dinner parties, getting to know people, and collaborating.

Thoughts?",YeraSoraVira,28,9,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/190sa5/my_adviser_doesnt_think_i_should_have_taken_my/,"So I got married last fall, a few weeks before starting graduate school. I took my husband's last name, it was my decision, he was fine with whatever I wanted to do and I wanted to change my name, so I did. 

My adviser, whom I otherwise love working with, thinks this was a horrible decision and keeps bringing it up, especially in front of other people, and not just my lab mates, but other faculty, and important people that I get the chance to interact with on occasion. 

His argument is that I should have kept it for 'professional' reasons. I don't think it makes a difference because I am not yet published in my maiden name, I do have a paper in press, but I have it in my married name. 

Yes I've done a few posters during my undergrad, but honestly the only people that remember those are people that know me personally, now that I'm in grad school they don't matter that much plus I have a really unique first name.

I'm not going to go and change my name back (I'm not even sure how you would go about doing that) but I was just wondering what everyone's thoughts were, and if you have any suggestions on how to talk to my adviser to get him to stop bringing up his opinions on this in front of other people, it is literally the only thing he does that bothers me, but lately its been bothering me a lot. 

**Additional Info:** He is married to an academic, who kept her maiden name, and is very supportive of her.

He is also very supportive of me, my research and professional development so I really don't think that this is out of any kind of malice towards me or an attempt to undermine me, at least not intentionally. 

**Update:** WOW Thanks everyone for your great input and thoughts. While I have no intentions of getting divorced (but as you all have pointed out no one really does). I'm going to have to think this over a bit more and then go talk to my adviser. He's really great and you guys are probably right that he doesn't realize how uncomfortable he is making me.

As a result of the poor economy, graduate and professional students are no longer eligible to receive Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans (this has been effective since July 1, 2012). As a result, all that is offered to grad students now are Direct Unsubsidized Loans at 6.8% fixed interest compounded quarterly. The compounding of interest starts immediately (unlike for the Subsidized Stafford Loans where the compounding of interest starts after you finish or leave graduate school). I crunched some numbers and you end up with a debt that is 1.4 or 1.36 times the amount borrowed (based on whether the loans are given out on a yearly or semester basis, respectively). Those numbers are pretty significant considering that you just graduated, haven't worked a day, and already have a debt that is a whopping 1.4 or 1.36 times what you borrowed.

Are there any private loans that you would be better of taking compared to the above? I'm leaning towards the fixed interest side (since who knows what you'll get yourself into by taking adjustable rate loans). Anyone else in a similar situation? Any info/advice would be helpful.

So perhaps if you have questions from that, please feel free to ask on one of those posts or PM me. I thought I'd move on to talking about interview/recruitment weekends. What I say will be directly applicable to biomedical programs, but for those of you in other fields, you still might find some useful information. I'll also reiterate that these are my opinions and are not necessarily anything that my program (or university) supports.

**Interviews in the biomedical field**

The biomedical field (and I would imagine some/many other sciences) has something that humanities often don't: money. What this means for prospective PhD students in the biomedical sciences is that programs can afford to fly out some number of students a year, wine and dine them for a weekend, and attempt to recruit either the top candidates in the field, or students that they feel are well suited for their program. We interview 40-50 students every year with the expectation of getting 10-20 incoming new students. 

If you have been invited out for an interview, keep this in mind. It means that a program is willing to lay out a few hundred bucks for your flight out, the money for a few nights in a reasonable hotel (expect to have a roommate though), and all the food and transportation costs associated with having you there for a weekend. If you have been invited, and they are willing to lay this money out for you, THIS IS A GOOD SIGN. If they aren't *really* interested in you, they aren't going to spend the money on you to do this. For some programs, this is more of a chance to recruit you. They already know they want you, so they're going to try to impress you and hope that you'll accept their offer. For other schools, this will be a flat out interview. For most though, the reality is somewhere in between. For my program, unless you really fuck up on your interview weekend and really raise some red flags, you're almost guaranteed an offer of admission. For other schools, this isn't the case. It can be hard to tell up front which version you're dealing with.

**How does an interview weekend work?**

The same basic theme applies to many larger umbrella biomedical programs. They'll fly you in Thu night. If you get in early enough, you'll likely have dinner with a small number of students and a few faculty. You'll hit the ground running Friday though. You'll likely start off with breakfast and an info session. You'll interview with anywhere from 4-8 faculty members throughout the day. You'll likely have a special student seminar in their somewhere and lunch with the students. Oh, and you'll likely have a current student host. Someone whose job it is to get you to your interviews close to on time and to answer any questions you may have. Use them wisely. Ask about their experiences there, what they've liked and disliked. If there is a faculty member you'd really like to meet and didn't get the chance to, ask your student host, they might either know the professor directly, or know someone in their lab that you can talk to. Friday night will likely be dinner with all the prospectives and all their hosts at some restaurant in town followed by some night time activity.

Saturday is often used for more social/see the town activities. We start off with breakfast and a Q&amp;A panel. This is the opportunity for applicants to ask any questions they might have that haven't been answered yet. We usually talk about rent, and prelims, and what we love about the city, etc. The rest of the day is usually used for activities. We usually offer a trip to one of our local breweries and something else non-alcohol related. Kind of a 'hey, there are fun things to do in this town.' We also usually do a driving tour of the city so we can show people what the city actually looks like, and aim to drive by a few areas students tend to live in. Saturday evening is generally the faculty dinner, where all the current students, all the applicants, and many of the faculty gather at a faculty members house to have dinner. At this point, you'll be tired. Just go with it. This is also your last opportunity to talk with any faculty you might not have met, or corner grad students of faculty members you haven't met. Saturday night for us has rotated some. Last year we took recruits bowling. The year before we had game and movie night. And then Sunday, off you go. 

**What do I wear?**

If you are given a suggestion, follow it. If they say business casual, a nice pair of slacks and a somewhat dressy shirt is sufficient. If they say jeans, go with a nice pair of jeans, a nice shirt, and something other than sneakers. Here's the key though: know the weather. We invite students out in February. February is also one of our coldest snowiest months. So we do actually tell recruits/interviewees that jeans and snow boots are perfectly acceptable, because most people don't know how to dress warmly in business casual, and well, we are a casual bunch overall. If you show up in a suit, you won't be judged badly, but expect people to look at you weird. Likewise, if you are told business casual somewhere, don't wear jeans to your interviews. It will be considered disrespectful. This is also a great question to ask your student host (hopefully they get in contact with you before hand so you can ask). 

**What's the whole recruitment vs interview thing?**

Some programs used to do out right admission, and then invite you out to see the school and essentially interview the program. And somewhere along the way, a few people fucked this up. The worst story I heard on one of my interview weekends was an applicant who had pyromaniac tendencies, and kept lighting stuff on fire. Seriously. So in reality we call this an interview weekend. We want to make sure you don't set off any red flags. On the other hand, we internally call it recruitment. We want to wine you and dine you and show you a good time. Pull out as many bells and whistles as we can to show you how awesome we are and that you should really come here. But again, it can be really hard to gauge which type of weekend you've been invited to.

**What should I be asking on my interview weekend?**

There are tons of lists out there, and most of them I agree with. But don't be afraid to ask questions that are more pertinent to your situation. I moved here from a major city on the East Coast and had a really hard time gauging whether the stipend here would be livable. So I found someone who had lived where I did, and ask them about it. If you've got kids, or are thinking of having kids while in grad school, ask about this. Some programs are incredibly flexible and realize that students lives don't stop just because they are a grad student. Other programs don't seem to get this (yet). Ask. Ask about what is important for you. 

But you might also want to ask some more general questions that will help you figure out your decision in the end. How many labs do I get to choose from? How does funding work? What do prelims/quals look like at this program? Do a lot of students drop out? Do the current students seem *happy*? (This one really struck me on two of my interview weekends. One school I visited, it really just seemed like the students were miserable and down trodden, and I'm sure for some, this is fine. But at another program, the students genuinely looked and behaved happy.)

**How do I make my decision at the end of all this?**

There are many different ways to do this, and I'll tell you worked for **me**. Where did I feel most at home? Where did I feel welcome? When I considered these two questions, one program stood head and shoulders above the rest. I applied to 8 schools, interviewed at 5, but really only considered two. One of the programs I interviewed with was really anti-teaching, and while I don't know (still) if I want to teach or not, I knew I wanted the experience. Pay attention to these things. They'll help you make your decision.

**Misc.**

If you don't drink, then don't drink on your interview weekend. If you tend to get crazy when you drink, don't drink on your interview weekend. If you blackout when you drink, don't drink on your interview weekend. Etc. You will likely find a heavy drinking culture in many programs. Know that this is pretty much par for the course, but don't feel pressured or feel bad for turning down alcohol if you don't want to drink for any reason. Likewise, if you do drink, and you make an ass of yourself, the current students will talk about it. It might not hurt your chances of getting in, but you won't know that ahead of time.

When your interview weekend is over, send out appropriate thank yous. Your student host, the chair of the interview weekend, anyone who was incredibly helpful to you, the people you interviewed with, etc. Keep them short and to the point. If there is something that you really wanted to follow up on, this is your opportunity. Even if you don't end up going to that school, those people will likely be people you'll run into again in your field.

If you need special accommodations for any reason, remember to ask for them ahead of time. And don't be surprised if they aren't met. I require a gluten free diet for medical reasons. Some programs handled me great, and they also tended to be the ones I felt most welcome at for many other reasons. One program stuck me with a baked potato for lunch one day, and an iceberg lettuce salad with no dressing the next day. Needless to say, that is not the program I'm currently in.

Wow, that was more than I thought I had in me. Hopefully someone finds it helpful.

Our whole job as postgrads is to become experts about niche subjects. In order to use that expertise, we need to be able to convey our ideas to a wider audience. There are lots of guides to public speaking out there, but I've found that there are some issues that are unique to STEM postgrads. I'm not some kind of master orator, but I've won a few public speaking prizes so I must be doing something right. I gave a presentation on public speaking skills to the postgrads in my department a few months ago and since it was well received I thought I would share it here. 

[pdf version of the talk](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eho6cr6wmjwaos2/publicspeaking.pdf)

**Summary:**

* Public speaking matters for everyone, even if you plan on being a lab rat.

* Know your material: Why are you doing what you're doing? How does it fit into the broader context?

* Know your audience: Who are you talking to and what do they care about? Address your audience in terms that are important to them. No one is going to your talk to hear you speak - they are going to learn something they find useful. You aren't a rock star.

* Know your story: Have a focused message and stick to it. Don't do a data dump and don't just recap your paper. Pick one message and make sure every aspect of your presentation supports it.

* Make simple slides without a lot of clutter. If you use technical figures make sure to explain them and highlight what's important.

* Be confident and passionate in your delivery. If you don't believe yourself and care about what you have to say, no one else will either.

* Practice as much as possible. 99% of people are nervous and scared about public speaking, but you don't get better by sitting on the bench. 

I made this specifically for engineering grads, so how do those of you in other fields prepare presentations? Any tips or advice?",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_16je8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/16je8m/public_speaking_for_postgrads/,

Throwaway account here. I'm having a serious problem and am looking for some perspective.

I graduated with an MPA from a DC-area university in Spring 2012 and went directly into a PhD in Political Science in Los Angeles as of this fall. I loved my MPA and I went in with the intention of leaping from it to a PhD program.

I enjoy my current program (though I've only had a semester in it so far). However, I absolutely hate the Los Angeles area. I've lived many places around the US and I've never had this kind of issue acclimating to a place. I have no friends and I am currently the most depressed I've ever been in my life. I'm having trouble sleeping, trouble staying motivated, and trouble forcing myself to leave the apartment. It started a week or two after I arrived here and hasn't let up since. 

That said, I enjoy the work (and I'm not sure it's the work that's causing me the distress). The thought of spending 4-6 more years in Los Angeles AND the thought of quitting academia and not going on for a PhD are both equally distasteful.

For example, I only wanted to work 9-5 at my job - literally, start working at 9am and stop at 5pm. I prioritized my tasks, delegated projects, declined projects, and made sure everything I needed to do was done in a 40-hour time slot over 5 days. Tim Ferriss pushes an extreme example of this in ""4 Hour Work Week."" [This article](http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/16/opinion/stone-leave-work-day/index.html) takes a more ""working mom"" approach but talks about Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, doing the same thing.

This carried over well into my Master's studies. Granted, I had a project-based ""thesis"" versus an actual paper thesis but the weekly schedule structure was the same: aside from classes, I only wanted to spend X hours per week on school work - what could I cull, what meetings could be shortened or eliminated, etc. 

The number of work hours went up from working in the field to doing a Master's so the actual ""40 hours"" stated in my title is arbitrary, but my question is if it's possible to continue this type of scheduling into a PhD program (I start in about a month). I've sat in on PhD classes, talked with the current students at my program, and also asked professors from various programs and from what they've said and what I gather, work in a PhD program is never really done. You could spend every day of the week working on a paper and there would still be more to do, even when you successfully defend and get your diploma, there's still more to do, so knowing that, wouldn't you want to stop PhD-related work at some point (during the week) and move on to other things like personal work (family life, kids, etc)? Where is that line between putting your heart and passion into your program and overworking yourself to an early burnout? 

I've asked this question to a few other people and the response I immediately get is ""You must be lazy."" If you had this response in your head as you read my question, I don't blame you. I fully understand how this could come across as me only wanting to put in the bare minimum and scrape by with my PhD program. When I was in undergrad, I was a huge procrastinator with no time management skills and I would often BS my way through ""bare minimum"" work at the last minute. Ironically, this new type of scheduling has eliminated my procrastination.

PhD for organic total synthesis. I have wanted to be a chemist since I was a child. Always been blessed with direction, drive, and knowing what I want to do. Decided I waned to go for a PhD early in high school. I have done rather well so far.

Now that I am here though, I am not happy. Science is *hard*, and quite frankly, I can't take it anymore. I have a wonderful boss, I am at a wonderful school, and I have and had droves of people to motivate me and help me when I am down an out. That no longer helps though. Simple fact of the matter is, I pretty much hate science now. I've loved it since I was 4 years old and discovered what it was. I couldn't get enough! Now though, I don't want to look at science, read science, think science, ANYTHING to do with it. It makes me feel sick, like a failure, how I am a failure as a scientist, and I have just faked my way up to this point and bee very lucky to get this far. I actively ignore science now. All I can think of is how much work it is, how much time all of these people devote to their persuits, and how I can not stomach that level of work, how inadequet and a waste I am for not wanting or being able to do that. I can't look at science.

I hate chemistry now. I come in to lab with no motivation. I could give absolutely two shits about my work (which I used to love). I don't want to do any of it. I very likely will want to start over if I finish. I have been beat up by life, and in particular science, too many times and I can't take it anymore. It has reached a point where it isn't worth it at all. When I solve a problem? My feeling is ""It's over! Now go die in a fire."", not that cool ""oh look what I discovered!"" feeling. I just do not care. We will sit in meeting and discuss papers on newly discovered things in chemistry. I sit there and in my head I think ""oh how I just don't give a shit. Who gives a fuck?"". I was not like this before I started grad school. I went to a high school of 2,000, and got the award for the most outstanding chemistry student, and most outstanding senior in science, because of my overwhelming curiosity and drive for discovery. I've had so many support me since I was young, and they (and I) all hoped I'd one day be this world reknowned scientist.

What else am I to do though? I have +100,000$ from undergrad loans. If I quit that will need to be paid, and I can't afford that unless I finish and have a job that pays enough. Money scares me more than ANYTHING in the world. I literally lose sleep a few nights a month over my loans, even though they're deferred right now. Worse yet, I don't want a chemistry job, a lab job, or anything related. I hate this stuff now. School, and work is pretty much the soul source of my depression. Added to life just not giving me anything to look forward to, and my shit neurochemistry, I don't see the point. 

Every job I have ever held I have ended up hating after a while. Now I am seeing that even stuff I once loved, will get killed by work. It's like working in something, regardless of what it is, will make me begin to hate and resent it in every way. It's like I am wired to be lazy, a waste of space, and a burden on soceiety, and I am absolutely powerless to change it. I feel like a terrible, terrible person because of this. I have been afraid to tell anyone this because of how terrible it is. I just want to sit in my room, and do nothing. Just browse the internet and do nothing. Forcing myself to work hard just leads me to depression and terrible mental health. I have been fighting through scuicidal thoughts for over a year now. I can't even find the motivation to cook as often, clean very much, foster friendships.

The longer I stay in grad school, the more deeply I am falling apart. I am financially trapped though, and it is no ones fault but my own. I don't fucking know what to do, because I honestly want to do nothing. I keep telling myself it will get better. I've been telling myself that since I started grad school. It's been one step forward, and two steps back. Over time, that adds up. I'm starting to just not care about anything. Not one thing at all.

I am from Ireland but have been living in the US for the better part of 3 years. I haven't had any luck finding a job recently and i am really starting to be drawn back to academia (which i had planned to do after a few more years of work experience)
From what i can tell, i have the appropriate academic and professional background for the application.
BA, MA, 3 years experience working in top International organizations(at low levels) and decent recommendations. 

The truth of the matter is that i wouldn't be able to afford to pay tuition here in the states and could only afford to do a phd if i was getting paid.
I've read on most university websites that they do offer financial assistance but im not exactly sure what that refers to? a stipend? a percentage off your tuition fees?

Also, is it more likely that i would get better financial assistance from a lesser known college/state university?
My main concern would be the cost, not particularly how high the school is ranked.

Also, i have looked into the GRE exam and while i hate the idea of having to study math again i will take it if necessary. Is it necessary? i would like to study Political Science and some schools require it but others don't mention it on their webpages.

Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't really know anyone who did/is doing their phd here in the states so i thought i'd ask you guys!

Don't say anything and have a letter writer mention it? Talk with the potential advisor about it? Burn down the registrar department? I've heard mixed things, so any advice is appreciated. 

This is intended to be directed towards a general audience, however, this is my situation (no bullshit, but I realize that won't work with admissions):
In ~2005 I started taking classes at a community college as a senior in highschool; I got all A's. 

Fast forward a year, and I'm at my first university (let's call it UofA); I spend two years there and get a two B's, a handful of C's, and two F's in Chinese and chemistry. 

Then I move to another university (let's call it UofB); I take classes for about a year and a half, starting off with a few A's and a C, then I quickly drop to mostly C's, D's, and the occasional F. 

I take time off of pursuing my degree (2 years). During that time, I take community college classes with mostly B's and C's. I go back to the UofB and fail most of my classes, get suspended, and then re-instated immediately with the stipulation that I need to work with my undergraduate advisor. 

Second go at the UofB, I start off slow, only taking one real class, but I get an A. In the summer, I take a full load and get two A's and a B+. After that, I take the fall semester with all A's except for one A-. 

This semester, I'm taking about 18 credits and I should get all A's. I'm taking 21 credits in the summer (most of these credits replace bad grades) and 21 in the fall. 

Looking at this quantitatively, I have a 3.99 GPA for the last 60 credits. I will have a 3.6 GPA for the UofB. Unfortunately, the community college and the UofA bring me down to 3.0 after summer grades or 3.1 after fall. I have C's o-chem, gen-chem, and statistics. As it stands, I have about two years of field research, a year and a half of lab research, and I'm working on a few projects that might get published before applications are due.  

Why do I have poor performance? Girls and depression. I was totally girl-crazy (even though I wasn't too successful) and I was severely depressed. I moved to the UofB because I got kicked out of my fraternity (turned out to be a good thing) and well, I was floundering at UofA. Maybe, if I had any idea of what I wanted to do back then, I would have done better. Alas, that didn't happen.

Thankfully, after getting kicked out, I realized that I wanted to be in and found something that interested me. I've worked hard to get to where I am, but I'm not going to impress anyone by saying that I chased girls. Although, if you're only looking at GPA, I'm a terrible applicant, but I've done a lot to make sure that that I'm a damn strong candidate.

TL;DR: I went to a few schools and had poor performance because I didn't realize what I wanted to do. I took two years off and returned to school, failed out the first semester, then I've earned A's for the last two years and have a good amount of research experience.

In any event, I appreciate any advice. Be as hard as you can, I need to hear the truth.

I'm doing a PhD in physics (I'm in my 2nd year), and part of me *does* love it. I love learning new things every day, seeing how the universe works, the fairly casual environment, learning how to use cool machines, etc. And, having the future job security of a PhD in physics from a top tier school isn't bad either.

But part of me has this nagging feeling of wanderlust, or ""is this the best way to spend my 20s?"". I spend so much time working that I'm not really making many friends (I have a handful but not as many as I'd like). I've dated a few girls since being here but work ends up taking priority, so they're often not long lasting. Relatedly, I actually want to meet someone special, but you can't really do that if you don't meet many people. I used to play lots of music but that has withered away. One of the biggest ones is that every time I go on the internet, I see pictures of amazing places I haven't been, and realize that there's a good chance I won't go to them if I don't go soon.

I'm aware that no matter what you do with your life, you are seeing the world. In grad school's case, I'm seeing a very deep and minute part of the world, which is cool... but maybe not the best way to be able to connect with other humans.

I know there's probably not much to be said about it, either I like it enough to stay, or I don't and I should leave. But I would love to hear about other peoples' experiences and thoughts!

Edit: More gripes

Also, I go to school in a part of the country that is bitterly cold for way too much of the year, and every time it rolls around I find myself thinking ""I *need* to get out of this awful place."" Part of me wants to move to CA and never look back.

I applied to my doctoral program (Applied Sciences) last year after meeting my adviser at a conference. I got onto her project and into the program with full funding until dissertation time. So happy! 

Throughout my first year, though, issues have come up: 

* Adviser hates being a professor and an academic, and loudly proclaims this. As she is the only person I want to work with in this department, this is really not good for me. 

* Continuing with point above, everyone else in my department is strongly into either CS, chemistry, or physics, none of which engage me or interest me in the slightest (I'm in informal education and biology). 

* Adviser also loudly wishes that she left her program with just the M.S., so she could work in industry. Now she is 'stuck in academia', and repeatedly points out how much she hates it, and she's bullied by other professors. In fact, she is taking on a second position to 'ease her way out of it'. 

* During our rare advising meetings, my adviser either A) Asks me about where I'm thinking of working or independent projects, or B) Personal stuff (love life, my family, my cats, etc). She has openly stated that she sees me more as a friend, rather then an advisee or employee. 

* My other adviser has strongly suggested that I leave the program, as I don't seem to fit in with the evolution of the program (they are going more into technology and hard sciences, where I struggle). My main adviser thinks this is a fantastic opportunity to use the skills I acquired in the research field to be used in a private job, where I ""can escape the drudgery of academia, make money, and have fun."" They will support my decision if I choose to switch to another department. 

* Other adviser is awful to the other RA in our group; he has failed her on her comps, and told her to her face that he doubts she will defend her dissertation in the next three years (she just finished her fourth year). I am frightened of what he will do to me. 

I'm really upset at this, and feel betrayed. I wanted to earn a Ph.D and become a professor and researcher for so long. I don't know how respected my research will be if I don't have a doctorate (I do have a Master's though).  

But my professors are unhappy, and I'm less then thrilled with the swift change in our very young department. 

Additionally, I don't know how to feel regarding to my main adviser telling me I don't need a doctorate, and that I should leave with her!
I'm so confused. I have a meeting with another department chair in a couple of days to see if I can transfer into her program. But what my adviser said rattled me: that she's leaving, and I would be happier working and making money with her. It doesn't help that I just got a job offer from an associate's firm as a research writer that could become permenant, doing basically what I do now for more then twice the paycheck.  

TL:DR: My adviser, the only reason why I am in this doctoral program, wants to leave academia forever. She is suggesting I leave as well, due to the changing atmosphere of the program and the poisonous brick-wall attitude of my other adviser. I'm conflicted and don't know what to do.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_1fnfy8,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1fnfy8/adviser_wants_to_leave_academia_and_suggests_i/,

I've been trying to get a project going but start up has been slow. I've done a pilot experiment and a real experiment (that got bad data), so the first experiment of the project needs to be done again, but I have to build up my supply of plants. I'm in the ""wait"" stage of ""hurry up and wait.""

Last week after lab meeting, my adviser called me back into the lab with our post doc (who was a grad student in the lab but stayed on for a post doc). He was pretty excited and said, ""Alkanechain! Postdoc has a great idea for an experiment you can work on with him."" He then proceeded to outline.... the very same set of experiments I've discussed with him several times over the past 4 or 5 months. The very same set of experiments PostDoc ALREADY KNOWS I'M WORKING ON, along with two additional experiments that weren't exactly revolutionary--they would complement it well but it's nothing so big to justify, ""Well, I had this idea so your project is now mine.""

I did mention that yes, most of the experiments were ones I had already proposed, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears. My adviser then proceeded to describe how the post doc would be micromanaging me, such as: ""You need to do EVERYTHING he says, when he says. No futzing around on getting timepoints!"" I found this incredibly insulting: I don't even know why he mentioned it, considering he has no evidence to suggest I've ever missed time points (??).

I'm not even sure where to begin on how angry this makes me. I was supposed to take over the project PostDoc worked on as a grad student (he defended in April), but now that I've outlined a project for myself I feel like he's swooping in to take over it after realizing there might be some exciting data. I feel enraged that my adviser can't seem to remember even the VAGUEST DETAILS of my research project between meetings of him. I feel enraged that I've been trying to get the groundwork in place for this project since May, but after meeting with PostDoc today it's clear he: 1. has no idea what the current state of our plant stocks are... because he doesn't put work into maintaining them and 2. he has no experience working with the insects we'll be using. He wasn't even aware we already had a colony.

I do not want to work with PostDoc, but I feel whenever I try to bring it up I'm accused of being too negative. Well, it's probably true: PostDoc was supposed to be my mentor during my first year since I was supposedly taking over his project, but I honestly learned more from his undergrad than I ever did from him, and following his advice has gotten me into a lot of trouble at times. As a friend I like him, but as a mentor I have no desire to work with him anymore. 

I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I'm supposed to be writing out an ""Experimental Plan"" for PostDoc but I'm too frustrated to think.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_148maj,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/148maj/post_doc_moving_in_on_my_project_need_to_vent/,

When I was in college I wrote an honors thesis through a lab in the genetics department. We actually got some really cool results and decided to publish. I wrote up a manuscript that was almost ready to be submitted, but then my PI got denied tenure and left our university for one in another state. In her new lab she (supposedly) continued to work on this project (which was my original idea, by the way, not an ongoing project in the lab). 

Mean while, I email her regularly asking for updates on the paper and everytime she replies (when she does reply) saying the paper is ""almost ready."" I'm getting fed up and want to submit it myself, but she says she has all this new data which I don't have access to. 

Ok, flahshforward to this February (a full 3 years since we decided to publish) and she sends me a draft of the abstract and intro and a few figures, saying she's getting ready to publish. As far as I can tell, she's written the intro by randomly copy an pasting parts of my honors thesis together, and it doesn't make much sense. I give her a bunch of comments and make a bunch of corrections and send it to her. 

Flash forward to this morning: she emails me a draft saying she's submitting **tomorrow**. The draft has not incorporated any of my edits. The disscussion section isn't even *written*. To top it off, all the data that she's added in the last 3 years is mysteriously missing. When I ask her about this she says that that data was generated by another professor, but they couldn't validate an antibody or something so she decided to leave it out. However, she also (presumably) accidentally forwarded me a conversation she was having with another author which says that the reason the data is missing is because that other professor withdrew her name from the paper, doesn't want her data being used in it, and has also vowed to never collaborate with my PI ever again. 

What the hell is going on here? I'm really conflicted about what to do about all this. I'm supposed to be first author on this paper, but I feel like I've been totally shut out of the process. It seems like there is something shady going on as well. I want to get our results out there, but I also don't want my name attached to shitty work. What do you all think I should do? Do you think it would be totally inappropriate to email the professor who withdrew her name from the paper and ask her what is really going on? Ive never met or spoken to her before. My PI has a history of lying to me, so I don't really trust her word on it. 

Sorry if this is rambling and full of typos. I'm writing on my phone's safari app since I've blocked reddit from my computer and deleted alien blue while I'm taking my qualifying exams. 

Tl;dr: my college PI wants to submit our paper tomorrow even though it's totally unfinished and also she might be lying to me about missing data. Help?

edit: thanks everyone for their advice. Former (*thank god*) PI has been sending me revisions throughout the day. I may have overreacted slightly, because it's not *total* shit, it's just not very well written at the moment. If we had 2 weeks to work on it it could shape up well. As I said in some of the comments, the foundation of the paper is solid and the data and findings are good. It just seems very amateur-ish. She's waiting for further revisions from another collaborator (again whom I don't know, and I'm not sure what his involvement is) on the discussion section. Apparently this guy is good at writing about behavior?

I've asked her to delay submitting it so that I have more time to work on it (she knows I'm in the middle of my quals- why she waited until now to tell me she's submitting it I don't know). She's reluctant to do that because tomorrow is the deadline to be in some memorial publication for her late former adviser, but she says she's going to see if they can extend it. I'm going to keep on her on that. Hopefully we can delay submitting. If we can't I'm not entirely sure what I'll do.

I have emailed the other professor to ask what's up. Maybe it's horribly inappropriate and will blow up in my face, but I just have to know. 

**edit 2**: After listening to all your advice, talking about it with my current PI and a few other people, I decided to pull my name from the paper unless she can wait until after my quals are done. I told her to feel free to publish without me if she insists on going through with submitting tonight. I'm sad because I was proud of that work, but hopefully it's for the best.

I'm not quite sure how to start this as I just recently admitted to myself how miserable I am in graduate school. This post may seem very jumbled, so I appreciate anyone taking the time to read it. I'm in my second year in a lab with a first-time PI (if I make it, I'll be his first  student to graduate). He's a great scientist, but the most intense individual I've ever met. I know that there are a lot of demanding, unreasonable, driven people in science, but this man is just crazy. And have you ever noticed how unstable, unsuccessful people are labeled as ""crazy,"" but if you happen to be crazy and intelligent it becomes ""brilliance?"" 

So far, graduate school has been the most dehumanizing experience of my life. My PI demands unwavering focus and passion. I put in 10-12 hours a day, and rarely take off weekends. I'm 2000 miles away from my family, and while I love my friends to death, they're all unhappy too. I feel like a robot. I've sacrificed so much for this lab. I don't have relationships, go to many social events, or even see my friends that often. I good day for me is one where I find the time to eat, and make it through the day without sobbing in the bathroom. It's made me very, very resentful of EVERYTHING. I don't care about my research. I don't care about helping people or contributing something to the field. All I want is to get out with my degree and make money by going into industry. The prospect of pursuing research for the rest of my life actually turns my stomach.

I've never experienced depression like this. My mood swings anywhere from absolute despair over my lack of progress (multiple aspects of my thesis project are not working) to total numbness over my entire situation. I've made appointments with both a psychiatrist and psychologist because I'm no longer capable of handling this on my own. If I compromise too much more of my mental health, I'll never make it to my defense. 

I guess I'm putting this all out there to ask: is this normal? Is it possible to rebound from graduate school-induced depression? I'm talking the kind where getting out of bed in the morning is so emotionally painful that it deserves praise. Again, I don't want to quit, but I can't endure this level of unhappiness for too much longer. Is there really an end in sight?

(Long),gradthrowaway12,18,2,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/10fe3e/considering_leaving_gradschool_need_help_long/,"Hey everyone, so I am currently in my first year as a PhD student studying Chemical Engineering but as the semester progresses I have started to strongly doubt my desire to stick it out and stay for the next 5+n years. As an undergrad I had quite a bit of research experience and I truly thought that I enjoyed it at the time, hence why I decided to continue going to school but now that I'm finally here I think the reality of the situation is starting to really sink in.

I'm in a completely new school and city and I've had a lot of trouble connecting with my classmates and making friends. Honestly I am fairly outgoing and I really enjoy going the bars, meeting new people etc, but unfortunately many of my classmates are the polar opposite. At my undergrad uni I had a very satisfying social life but here I am having a hard time and feeling really depressed honestly. I have so much work to do that it makes even meeting people outside the department really difficult. On facebook I see all of my friends partying all the time and enjoying their new (and lucrative) jobs and neighborhoods and I cant help but think I'm really missing out. 

I really want to switch my terminal degree to masters but it's only been about a month now and I am honestly embarrassed to do so. The school was very generous to me and awarded me with a graduate stipend, tuition waiver, and fellowship so I am basically being paid around 30k a year to attend as a PhD. I'm truly grateful for that  but I cant help but feel that I'm forcing myself to be here, but at the same time I don't want to squander an opportunity. If I switch to masters there is a strong possibility I will lose everything and have to pay my way.

What should I do? Anyone with a similar experience want to share? Any help or advice is really appreciated.

However, I'd really prefer a position at a smaller liberal arts college, where I can focus on teaching but still be an active researcher.

Almost simultaneously I developed health problems that affected my ability to keep up with the program. Long story short, my department kicked me out because they weren't sympathetic to my ongoing problems (yes, despite doctor's notes). By kicking me out I lost my health insurance, which means I'm not able to get the treatment I need. So I'm stuck in this kafkaesque purgatory of incrementally seeing nonspecialist doctors while I'm burning prime years of my life.

I want to continue with a Ph.D. in my field or a related field, but I'm not confident my health problems are resolved, or will be even with access to health care. The health problems come in streaks where I cannot keep up with a big workload for a month or two at a time, and I cannot predict in advance when this might happen. When it happens, I have to prioritize my tasks so I'm down to maybe 30 hours a week of productivity. So it's not the case that I'm not suited for employment, or that I cannot do a full course load - it's that I cannot do both at once while in those bad streaks. Ideally, I'd want to quickly get to a point in a program where I can focus on research, or find a program that will let me take a slower pace, or a program that wouldn't hassle me about have a bad term (and to be sure, this is just if my health problems continue to affect me the way they did before).

If I entered another program, and I continue to have these problems, I could get fucked over again. Just having access to health care wasn't enough to avoid getting fucked over the first time.

What should I do? 

How can I tell in advance if I might get fucked over by a department? I can't exactly ask current grad students about this specific issue. 

Would I be less likely to get fucked over at a department with a mediocre reputation?

How do I ask departments if my possible health problems would be a problem?

How do I ask for possible accommodations?

Nobody I know has any advice on this. It's as if no one ever heard of health issues in the context of grad school. Even the doctors in the university district shrug, ""that's a sticky situation. Come back in three months and we'll run another test"" (then I tell my department chair about this update and all he hears is I have a health problem that won't be addressed for a whole academic term). I can't go to my former professors; their actions speak louder than any words they have, and their actions say they have low regard for my future.

I want to make clear, I'm very good at my field. I've spent all my life preparing for this career. People less talented than myself are continuing in the program I got kicked out of because they got better grades and didn't have their time sapped at inopportune times with health problems. People I've taught, tutored, and did homework for are now at MIT, Los Alamos, Carnegie Mellon, CERN, among others. But my career track got derailed by this health problem. A health problem that only infringes on my productivity at irregular intervals.

Also I'm not very good at ""selling myself"". Someone else in my position might know how to manipulate the grad school bureaucracy to make things work out in their favor, or have built a rapport with everyone in a position of power over them. Someone I know who's a mediocre student and terrible employee seems to stay in the program by, for instance, smoking weed with his professor. I'm not that person. I just want to be given an opportunity to study and do research in my area and let my work speak for itself. Work that *might* take a bit longer gestate than most, but who knows.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

I'm a second year grad student in a science program and I'm about to go through preliminary exams/candidacy/whathaveyou in less than a month. I have clinical depression that's somewhat well controlled if I take my meds and sleep well and don't stress myself out. I was also seeing a therapist until I found that I couldn't find adequate time to travel to their office and do everything else that's expected of me. 

What advice could you give to someone like me who needs time and space to not stress out and break down in order to do a decent job studying for prelims and studying for other exams? 

My main problem is that my advisor needs to see his students in lab or else he thinks they're slacking off even if they're just working at the library. I find lab extremely non-conducive to writing or studying. I also get into depression ruts where I just don't want to get out of bed or even see anyone so when that hits, it's particularly difficult to show up to work.

I know the usual advice would be to sit him down and talk to him but if I knew how to do that without getting the anxiety accompanying my depression I would have done that already. In any case, others in my lab have tried doing that but without much success in getting through.

For what it's worth, I'm making reasonable progress on my project and I can easily set up an experiment, leave for the library then come back to check on it. However, that seems to be a no-no for my advisor because I'll get bombarded with emails asking me where I am.

Not to mention I'm only partially funded and though my debt from this year first year is no big deal, I'm looking at more burdensome debt for the next year.  

The only thing keeping my ass behind the desk in class each day is the fear that if I quit I'll be forever tiptoeing around the ""some graduate work"" line on my resume (or at least tiptoeing for a few years), maybe even struggling to find a job because of it. Also, as a secondary concern, I wonder if having a master's degree will allow me to earn more in the future. If I'm doing HR at a big corporation will I really make more money because I have a master's degree in music?

Whenever I mention it to faculty or staff in the department, they go on and on about how good the guy is in research, which I find quite absurd. Maybe he's too young to retire or something and they wanna stall for a couple of years, but taking his classes has really taxed my patience because he avoids interaction with students and generally wastes all of the lecture time rambling, repeating himself, and spouting nonsense. He gives most people good grades to avoid making waves, but there's always a risk that he will totally forget what he told us he would put on the test (which has happened before in multiple semesters). There is no motivation or problem statement for his examples, and he does not follow a book in any of his courses. That makes it really hard to do self-study or to make sense of what he puts on the board. Some students survive by studying old notes too, which is unfair to those of us who only have his nonsense notes to go by.

I feel like there's a chance that lobbying hard to make him retire would put me in a bad situation in the department but he is really not competent to teach. Obviously, I am posting with a throwaway, because I really don't want any fallout from this post in real life. I would appreciate any insight, advice, or similar experiences you guys can share.

**Edit:** By the way, I'm not saying his lectures are nonsense because I disagree with the guy during his lectures. He teaches a technical subject and he is totally incoherent and all over the place, which is a legitimate problem beyond just a subjective view of the guy.

Here's my story, briefly: I was a miserable PhD student who decided to master out, in part because I felt my PhD was progressing too slowly for me to finish in any reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately, the data I generated while here weren't publishable. Even though I've learned I don't want to do research as a career, having no publishes papers makes me feel like I'm graduating with nothing to show for it. On top of that, I don't feel like I learned any technical skills during my degree that aren't applicable outside of the field I was doing research in, and both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are in *Biology* which I've seen called 'the worst of the science degrees.'

During my graduate studies I developed an interest in science editing/writing as a career. Fortunately, I lucked out and met a professor's wife who is a successful science editor, and she appears willing to mentor me. However, as I have no formal training as an editor (no English, technical writing or communications degree), building my CV will take time and likely some volunteer work. It doesn't help that I have no publications under my belt other than my unpublished thesis, and I'm trying to decide how I should make money in the interim.

Part of me is sick of academia and constantly being ""on"" even when I have no work to do--I'm sure most of you are well-acquainted with the feeling of, ""What's going to go wrong tomorrow?"" even when your work for the day is done and you're at home. At the same time, I'm afraid that getting an ""easy"" job (like, I don't know, being an office assistant or working at a bar) is going to look bad on my resume and lock me into an unsatisfying career path in the future. I'm also extremely anxious, since neither my SO nor I have jobs lined up right now, but we're taking the plunge and moving to a new area so he'll be closer to workplaces that fit his degree/experience.

I apologize if this should be a /r/gradadmissions post or if this has already been asked here. I tried to search and check the FAQ's but I don't have the google-fu capacity to tease out that information if it exists.

I was wondering if anyone here has been in a similar situation where they had to request a LoR from their MS advisor to attend another university to get the PhD. If so, how did you approach it, and how did they react?

I'm currently an MS student on a fellowship through the graduate division. I was told by advisor that I could switch to PhD without having to earn my MS if I wanted, and I can sense that he'd like for me to do it. The main issue for me is that the school is an hour away from where I live and I can't move to campus for personal reasons (fiancee's job). If I was to continue my education past the Master's level, I'd like to make it as easy on myself as possible and go to school in the city in which I live. While generally I haven't cost my advisor too much money (since the graduate school itself is paying most of my way) I still don't want to come across as someone who coaxed him into making an investment in me under false pretenses as I have been partially supported by a GSR appointment in his lab.

Have any of you successfully navigated this situation before? Thanks in advance!

I already have my masters so I can probably leave for a decent paying job (although starting salaries and career opportunities for PhD is higher). 

Sure, doing applied and basic science research with potential engineering applications is great if you're interested but I feel that I want to work on something more applied, like actually building stuff, rather than constantly claiming that ""our results have the potential to solve X"" just to convince people to fund us. Personally, I feel that my work has no applications and we claim that applications exist just to get funding. It's almost deceptive.

Another thing I don't like is my thesis supervisor's micromanagement. Anyone can do a PhD - I'm just doing what she tells me to do. I just do whatever experiments she assigns me and then she or I suggest something and I do it. Repeat...and repeat. She makes me write and revise papers many times and then eventually, she would delete and edit enough so that it becomes her work entirely. I'm not saying I don't like the people I work with; they are all great. We have lunch as a group often and my adviser is very friendly and nice, but I don't particularly like her management/mentoring style. How much freedom should a graduate student have? I honestly don't know how it works in other groups...

Finally, I am getting bored of my subject. I had the hardest time getting myself to read papers. I struggled to find motivation to study for classes, exams, and the proposal (though I passed all of them). I don't know what to do anymore.

I have been accepted to a fairly large PhD program, top 15 in my field, and very much hoping to meet other like minded folks.

I suppose my current problem is a lack of people my age or with my goals. Every other graduate student in the program is just here to get a degree, get done, and get a better paying job than they would have had with only a BS. I find it hard to connect with students, talk about research, do things outside of academics, etc. Nobody seems to have a passion or enjoy the research they do. I'm hoping this doesn't sound snobby... but I really am looking for students who take their graduate studies very seriously and share similar goals or outlook as me and perhaps more students in their late 20's or early 30s even. Is this unrealistic? I'm hoping with a very well regarded program there will be a higher concentration of students excited and passionate about their work, hopefully leading to great conversations or friendships. 

I'm not particularly shy, but I'm not a party outgoing type either. I'm hoping to make a few close friends in my major or even other majors. I know joining clubs or activities could help. 

I'm curious if anyone else had expectations of meeting friends in their PhD program, and how did it go? Are you meeting people you get along with better than undergrad or worse, or what? A professor on my committee with a similar personality style as mine had said his best friendships came in graduate school, wondering if that is unrealistic expectation.

I suppose maybe I'm just a little frightened to be moving away from my family as well, but that is another story. And yes, I know how pathetic that is for a 29 year old to say.

I was wondering what I would do next other than retake it (which I would not want to do). Are there prospects for a Masters in Chemistry? I was considering becoming a Chemistry teacher at a high school level while I considered other options.

In my department, candidacy is a short public seminar, a written research proposal (which the committee almost never bothers reading), and a 2 hour oral defense of the proposal (pretty standard for physical sciences). I crushed the seminar, but the oral defense is another issue. The proposal is well-written/argued, but most of the work has been done (preliminary data almost published), which is generally a good thing, but in my case means that there is not much left to do in the proposal that isn't already done. If future work presented is not enough to fill 3 years of research, it is enough to fail the student. My advisor isn't worried but both postdocs in my lab have insinuated that I would not pass after I gave a mock oral during lab meeting. 



[UPDATE]: Passed without condition. I was actually somewhat surprised how easy they went on me. I messed up some fundamental questions, but they overlooked it due to my presentation skills and my overall confidence in the proposal. Thanks for all the feedback. I tend to prepare for the worst instead of being positive and expecting the best.

Basically, I'm stuck in the post-Masters funk. I graduated with a Masters in Modeling and Simulation right as my department was changing heads, and because of my indecision (and some clerical errors) I ended up having to re-apply for the PhD program. I thought I was a slam-dunk for sure, given that I maintained a rapport with key professors as well as a previous department head, but I got rejected for the Spring semester (basically this semester).

 I've only been able to talk with the new department head a couple of times, but I was able to tell that the department was moving in a different direction (basically, the cuts to the Department of Defense/Education meant that it was probably impossible to get funding for my proposed dissertation, which is probably one of the reasons why they rejected me). 

Since that happened, I thought I'd try to gain some career experience. I've been working (unpaid) at a laboratory on campus, sending out job applications as well as looking into other PhD programs. I initially thought that I'd be better off getting some work experience, but when I failed to find work after a couple of months I also started applying to PhD programs (I know, my indecision is the root of my problem). Problem is, I'm not sure if that will work out. 

Both the PhD programs that I'm looking at as well as the jobs that I applied to are in a field only tangentially related to my Master's (Human Factors/usability/UX). I do have experience from working at the laboratory, but I haven't heard anything positive at this point. If I get rejected for the Fall, then all I have lined up is my volunteer research experience. While that's nice, it's also kind of wrecking my emotions at the moment (I feel extremely guilty having very little to do during finals week, when my colleagues are almost all PhD candidates).

I'm in my third year of a Ph.D. program and one of my friends is a first year fresh out of undergrad. She's very young and it's her first time living away from home, being an adult (however much you can do that in grad school... ha), etc. And as the semester is going on, the pressure seems to be getting to her: she's expressed regret that she didn't take time off before coming to the doctoral program and feels totally overwhelmed by everything and by having never had a break. I think she'd like to take a year off but is worried about finances absent school + TA position and is also worried about the idea of an uncertain future.

This past weekend, we hung out briefly and she revealed to me that she's been cutting herself. I took her to a counselor on campus today but her next appointment isn't for a while, and she does not want to talk about that with the counselors because she's afraid of the possible repercussions of that kind of behavior.

I've advised her to keep in touch with our faculty about the possibility of taking incompletes for the semester until she feels up to finishing final papers (due dates are upon us!) but she seems reluctant to make that step. Any thoughts on how you might handle this situation? At what point would you - if at all - express any concerns to anyone beyond the person in trouble (e.g. department graduate adviser, someone else in the mental health office, etc.)? 

I know that she has to make her own decisions and pursue her own improvement in her own way, but I want to be as supportive as possible - grad school's a bitch, after all - and would really appreciate any thoughts from folks here.

Like many of you, I've been feeling the stress of grad school. At times, it's been pretty bad. I was reduced to tears for the first time within a week of starting, and things did not get any easier. Add in a seriously unhealthy family problem and home life, and it's given me a host of psychological problems, including idealizations of killing myself a couple years back. I've been seeing a therapist every week for years now, slowly getting better.

But grad school is still a pressure cooker. It's extremely difficult for me to turn off the voice that says ""Why aren't you working?!?"" at every moment. It feels like everyone else puts in more lab time than me. Right now it's spring break, and I've been working through it like I did with Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's been snowing all day and the road is like a skating rink, so I stayed home to work on a paper for one of my classes and my lab meeting presentation for Monday. And just now I got an e-mail from my PI asking me why I wasn't in the lab today. Have you looked out the window? Aargh!!

Just reading that e-mail made me go incredibly tense, like a giant hand grabbed me around the midsection and squeezed. Bottom line, it's starting to get to me. I don't want to be in academia anymore, and I definitely don't want to go the route of a tenured professorship. Hell, I don't even know I want to be in science when I graduate. I was seriously considering switching gears to go into business consulting. I'm just really having a hard time handling the culture of ""Why aren't you working harder?"" right now. 

Dropping out isn't an option, since I have no exit plan and I would be basically throwing away the last four years of my life to wind up in the same fucking tech job that I went to grad school to get away from.

**TL;DR** Suffice it to say, I was admitted to a PhD program, moved across the country to start this fall, and have now discovered that I will not be awarded my MA degree *at all*. Here I am now - no savings, no access to credit, and a TA salary with an expiration date - with my 10 year (hell, 25 year) plan made invalid. I will not be allowed to continue the PhD and after 2 years of dedicated, outstanding work I will not even have an MA in hand. I want to know if this is something that others have experience with and what they did.

My PhD program was aware that my MA was not in hand when I started and has been supportive as I've balanced my courses, assistantship, and final MA business this fall as well as my personal health issues. Unfortunately, I was unable to overcome my personal problems in order to pass the qualifying criteria to earn my MA. Without my MA in hand by the end of this semester, I will not be qualified to proceed in my PhD program. 

There are no more chances with the MA program I was enrolled in. I have been dismissed from the program. My transcript will still reflect all of my coursework but will not reflect an awarded degree. Nonetheless, my MA committee is still supportive and has indicated that they will help me in any capacity as I reset my life.

I'm terribly ashamed of this. I feel guilty for not living up to the expectations of my mentors. But I know that if I had not suffered the health problems that I did this year, the situation would not have turned sour. I'm passionate about my work, have done well in the PhD program thus far, and was known as a bright, respected, and ambitious student in my MA program. I believe that I am well-suited for the career that I have been pursuing and would like to continue to pursue it.

The thing is, I'm still short an MA. The game is over with the program I was at. But I hope that the new school I am at can be supportive and offer some options - perhaps the opportunity to pursue my MA here. My concerns however are that the dismissal from my previous program will be a scarlet letter and pretty much prevent my acceptance from any future program. I worry that this is really the end of the road.

I guess I want to know if this situation is unique or if it has happened before. How did you manage it? What resources did you have access to? What do you wish you would have done?

**UPDATE** I'll be taking a leave of absence from my PhD program (not withdrawing) and will earn my master's at the new school. I will not be able to enroll for classes until Fall 2013 though.

I am 24, male and single. Basically I got off the wait list in special circumstances to a very prestigious program (at MIT, if anybody has experience there) and academically it is a dream program. However I am pretty worried about my social life --it is a smaller program with many international students (who in my experience can be very cliquey) and from visits it just doesn't seem like an overly ""fun"" program.

The school I was planning on enrolling in is slightly less suited to my academic interests, but everyone I know who attended talked about it as a really fun and rewarding program. 

My question to you, people with grad experience, is would you change programs if it meant you would have a higher quality of life, have more fun, possibly make life-long friends? Or would you still go to the best school possible in your area of interest.

I'm a GTA, but with a twist:I teach business courses are a university abroad for my american university.  In return, I get all of my MBA courses paid for, but I am taking all of them online.

This semester I started Quantitative methods. The prerequisite was a class I took 6 years ago, but there was no review, we just jumped right in, halfway through a graduate book, with a lot of things not really explained. It's not that I didn't want to ask questions, but knowing the question to ask was a bigger challenge than finding the answer.  There is another GTA who has the highest grade, but would never help, I mean NEVER.  These aren't excuses, just saying I didn't know how to do most things, and if I took this class in person I would be asking questions every day.

Well I managed to have a 74% going into the last project, so all I needed was a 55% on the project to pass. However, we needed to create dummy variables with a data set she gave us. There were so many logical errors in the data set that I gave 4 pages of recommendations, and because of this, I ran no dummy variables: I know, what a dummy I am. 

All that to say, I may not pass the class, I feel like a dumbass, but i almost don't mind taking it over, except that now I may have to take an extra summer course.

Anyone else fail a graduate class or am I really the worst graduate student out there?

And how do I know that THIS - this new, completely unrelated field - is what I *really* want to do?

Let's say I actually grow a pair, walk into my advisor's office tomorrow and tell him I no longer wish to be a student in this department.  Will I be punished for this?

On the personal side of the coin, my cohort isn't the most welcoming, it's super segmented and because I wasn't funded, I miss out on all of the social events that are planned in the offices.  The couple events I have attended, I had no one to talk with, and everyone was grouped into their respective subfields, by cohort year.

Professors aren't willing to meet outside of office hours (I have to miss one of the office hours because I have class), and I don't understand about 99% of the material.

Due to the nature of her PhD research interests (i.e. American literature), she has begun looking at English departments at American colleges. However, what we are noticing for most of the Ivy League and large state universities is that their PhD program stipulates a series of 'language proficiency' exams 1-2 years into the study. Schools like Harvard, Cornell, Yale, Colombia, Stanford etc. ask for demonstration of 2 foreign languages. As Europeans, even to us this seems a little alarming - *fluency in two foreign languages?* I'm currently taking a DPhil at Oxford and had no such requirements - despite being quite comfortable with Ancient Greek/Latin and French/German whenever it is encountered in a critical/scholarly/theoretical context. However, the thought of having to take 2 exams/translation exercises to prove 'fluency' in a language makes me wonder just what they're asking of American PhD's! 

So: do you have to be fluent? Is it intensive? Am I right in assuming, then, that every pre-diss and post-viva'd American humanities grad student is wielding no less than 3 languages? My girlfriend, being half-Danish, is competent/conversational in Danish and German, and is working on her French. For (perhaps) obvious reasons, the Danish probably won't be so useful for her grad school application; she's more into Cummings than Kierkegaard.

So, what are your experiences? Can anyone give some advice? Is this sort of thing just a crammable prereq?",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_1h9nre,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1h9nre/us_grad_school_question_languages/,

I always kind of knew the program probably wasn't going to be what I thought it was but I had some hope, and it's quite clear now that that's not the case and I'm really just wasting my time here.  But how do I tell this to my adviser?  I've tried to give hints that I think I should leave to him and I just get told that I need confidence or motivation.  

It's not that I don't want to be in graduate school, but I finally fully realized (after it sat in the back of my head for 2½ years) that I should be studying physics and not computer science (I'm in scientific computing).  I'd need 3 semesters of undergrad before being able to go back and I'm getting a lot of mixed reactions to that when I tell people, but the more I think about it the more I feel it's right.

The hardest part is the fact that a lot of money has been spent on me.  I was funded with a stipend, plus at the beginning my PI bought me a $1300 laptop using his funding.  The only money I feel I truly earned was what I got from TA'ing.  Also I applied for a summer school thing for 3 weeks next month in Shanghai and got it, and the school paid $1200 and the NSF is covering the rest of my expenses for that.  Because of all this I'd feel really bad for leaving...it's a lot of money they spent on me that goes to nothing.

No one's been able to notice or realize that I don't really have any motivation, don't have the passion like the other graduate students, and don't know enough really.  I've talked to a lot of other people about this, and of course the CS professors and other CS students all tell me to stay in it, and physics people tell me to switch.  It's like the CS professors don't realize that it would be better for everyone if I left because I wouldn't use up their money for something that doesn't help them and I wouldn't be wasting my time here.  But they would still want to keep me.  (Seriously it's like breaking up with someone.)  I'm scared to talk to my adviser about it, though, because I know he'd be 10 times worse wanting to keep me.

The masters program that I am planning on going into is only offered at two schools in my area - one of them is the school I am already at, and it is far less prestigious than the other school that offers the program. Both schools are accredited, but that is really where the similarities end. The cost difference is insane, the study body is completely different, and the notoriety that one school has over the other is astounding. 

This hadn't bothered me at all until last night, when one of my professors (whom I deeply respect) gave me what basically boils down to a personal lecture about how I am ""too smart"" to stay at the school where I currently am, and instead need to pursue this other college. 

It left me completely blindsided. This was something I was thinking years ago, but had boxed up and put away when I made the decision that I didn't want to be paying for grad school when I was as old as my parents are (as my parents are still paying for *their* grad school). I decided that it didn't matter how well-known the school was - if the college I was choosing was just as accredited, and just as acceptable on paper, then why not?

So, graduate professionals - how much does this actually matter? I want to enter grad school and exit it knowing that I've made a good decision about my future. Obviously choosing a school that is accredited matters - but does choosing a school that has prestige matter more? If a future employer choose a graduate of this prestigious school over me, will I be able to just say ""well fuck them"", and move on?

For various reasons 3 years ago I made a choice to get an M.Phil. in Religious Dialogue from a major European University.  I got good grades, made great connections -- it was the best experience of my life and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

My American public school humanities BA was also funded with debt, and lots of it.  But the debt never seemed like a problem because I was always good at building websites.  I am employed at present in a role which borders on web development and marketing, making a salary which (barely) can support my wife and myself, while she goes back to professional graduate school in the health sciences.  I have worked since my college internship in the same small company, and I could see myself leaving in a year to try to build a career in either client management or internet marketing... if I weren't so bored with it.

Long story short, I have always been interested in religious dialogue and conflict.  (In my mind, this is the most important question of our age.)  For years I assumed I would get a **PhD**, but the jobs for religious studies professors are few and far between, and tenure-track positions seem to be incredibly rare.  Plus, a PhD is a 6-year process probably.  My wife and I are close to our family, and after graduation I don't want us to end up in a tiny college in the middle of nowhere, where I'm lucky to have an adjunct position.  Even still, this admissions cycle I have reached out to a number of top-tier religious studies programs and professors in the US, and they seem interested in my proposed thesis topic.

In recent months though I've had the idea to pursue another Masters, this time in a **Master of Public Affairs**, focusing on International Affairs.  This way I could study international geopolitical (and religious) conflicts throughout the world, perhaps focusing on Eastern European/Caucasian conflict centers.  I'm very excited about 2 years of studying such a topic, but very anxious about the career placement.  MPAs by definition usually get jobs in government, and again, my wife and I want to remain relatively local, and aren't thrilled about moving to DC forever.  Some MPAs do find work in the private sector, but I'm not sure if they do so in international affairs.  And if I'm just going to get a job in marketing, I might as well continue as an internet marketer, without going back to school!

Finally, there's the **MBA**, which offers a chance to stay local in my city of choice, studying in a couple of ranked national programs; both provide a part-time option, which might allow us to pay for it as I go.  The financial benefits are obvious, but it seems completely contrary to my childhood dreams of being involved in religious studies, or my adult dreams of working towards achieving religious dialogue.  BUT, if I got my MBA in International Business, maybe I could jump on board with a multinational company and focus on international development, or work as a consultant with expertise in European conflict zones, etc.  Sure -- but how many MBAs are in it for the altruism?  I can't pretend to kid myself that I *also* would be doing it for the money.

What degree, if any, should I pursue?  It's already October and I'm falling apart.

**tl;dr: I love religious dialogue and have a major interest in international geopolitical conflict zones, but I need a lucrative career because of debt load, my wife and I don't want to move permanently for work, and I want to make an impact on the world.

I'm a new masters student of Caribbean Cultural Studies, and I'm a bit concerned with how I'm doing (it's the second week of classes, so we're still fairly early here) making the mental/lifestyle switch between undergrad and grad school. This may just end up being more of a confessional than a request for help, but anyway, here's what I'm finding:

**The classes are fewer, but the work is significantly harder.**

My schedule is only Wednesday through Friday, and that has four classes in it. The undergrad me (who made the schedule to begin with) jumps for joy at the notion of a 3 day work week, even though I understood that there'd be a need to work outside of class. What I wasn't anticipating is how different the definition of 'difficult' work would be. My academic experience up until now has taught me that 'hard' work wasn't necessarily hard, just time consuming. An easy paper consisted of maybe 1-5 pages and 0-5 sources, so by logic the graduate equivalent would be just... more of it. I was wrong. The mental energy, and reading, required are massively increased from undergrad. First off, I'm reading things in more than one language, but even when I translate them to my native English (or they're in English to begin with), I still have exactly zero clue what I'm seeing. I'm finding philosophy to really be the roughest stuff to get, but it's not just the subject itself. It's the *way* we're required to understand the things we encounter that confuses me the most. Nothing I do, or know, about how to learn things really applies anymore. Just taking what I read and hear for what it is isn't enough anymore. I've got to learn how to absorb knowledge all over again. I guess my question is, when? Will the sharp learning curve ever level out? Will I ever understand what the hell I'm doing/reading/discussing at the advanced level I need to? What does ""advanced level"" even mean?

Thanks in advance!!

[Edit]: Wow, thank you so much to all who responded! Yes, I realize the flip-flopping of how the scales work between the different measures is a bit disconcerting. I apologize for that, 

Some people have noticed that the spirituality scale does not really apply to them. I also realize that the spirituality scale leaves something to be desired for, especially for those who don't necessarily identify with a specific religion. I identify as an atheist myself so I disagreed with a lot of those statements myself. I wish there would have been more research on this topic to inform the creation of my survey, unfortunately there just wasn't a lot there. Since I chose all open-source measures the number of good measures available were just not that great, but like I said arabis, this is definitely something to consider for limitations.

1367068191.0,12,self.GradSchool,1d7pnc,mental health issues during grad school,ghostlyheart0111,12,0,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1d7pnc/mental_health_issues_during_grad_school/,"I took a year off from my PhD program due to mental health issues (anxiety, depression, bipolar, ADHD), came back before I completely dealt with everything (how could I? Grad school brought up issues and pressures that never came up during my recovery) and now I am struggling to find a lab and interact w people in a normal way and not kill myself.

The research: I'm doing a rotation in a lab in a different school using techniques I've never done before.  The first experiment I did, I screwed up and my mentor made it seem as though it was completely my fault and that I had wasted the labs money even though he told me to use the incorrect reagents and I really had no idea that I should've saved this or done something a certain way.  Maybe, as a grad student, I should have known, but like I said, I've never done these techniques before so I had no idea.  My mentor pushes me to be self motivated and independent, so I look up protocols for things before we do them now, but he seems to get pissed off that I question him on why his protocol is different - ""it's just the way I do it"" or ""look it up"" is his response.  While he pushes me to be self motivated and independent, he also second guesses everything I do and when I make a ""stupid"" mistake, he makes me feel like an idiot (i.e. I want to order something and he tells me to double check the item, or 2 identical looking items have been marked in different colors since I started in this lab over a month ago, but this time they weren't and when I told him I didn't think we had any more of that item left, he showed them to me and condescendingly said I should have read the label instead of looking at the color).

Because I messed up the first experiment, I've become much more paranoid and worried about messing up again.  I stopped talking to labmates because I'm so concerned about focusing on the experimental procedures and doing everything correctly.  This has negatively impacted the atmosphere and I feel badly for that and I think it's all my fault.  I could be social and fun, but doing that at the beginning caused me in adding incorrect volumes of a reagent to my experiment/etc. because I get easily distracted very easily. So now I put my headphones on and stopped talking to everyone, but everyone seems to really just hate me now that I stopped being friendly and talkative.  People even go so far as to actively avoid me by using a different entrance to the lab/etc.

Everyone in my department and my school also seems to dislike me, save for a few individuals.  When people see me, they avert their gaze or I see a flash of disgust cross their face.  On one hand, I shouldn't care because I'm here to learn, but grad school/science is a social field and it would be nice to have some friends in my program.  Most of the profs dislike me and avoid me as well.  I think/know they respect my scientific abilities (based on feedback I've received), but they know that I'm awkward and very up/down/unpredictable, so both profs and students don't know if I'll be friendly and talkative (overly so), or downcast and depressed and angry and avoidant.  Most of the students also know I had some issues with drugs in my past and think that I used that as an excuse for my year off, maybe they think I'm still using drugs (I'm not, quit smoking weed which was the biggest thing because it made me lazy and unmotivated, and also stopped eating LSD/shrooms/etc. on a regular basis like I had been doing prior to my year off in order to escape reality - luckily nothing hard like painkillers etc.) and that has also definitely affected my interactions with other students.

Maybe I'm just ranting.  My current plan is to try to be friendly, at least a bit, even if I don't really feel that way, just to put people more at ease.  I also think I should tell someone (my mentor maybe, or maybe someone else) a shortened version of my issues with anxiety and messing up my experiments and how that lead to my social withdrawal. I'm not sure what to do about other students.  It doesn't help that I look very intimidating and people are scared of me off the bat (was walking to the bus the other day and a mother and her daughter were walking down the sidewalk in the opposite direction and the mother grabbed her daughter's hand and pulled her in close and averted her gaze as they passed me).  

This is the first time I've had suicidal ideation (no intent) in a long time.  A part of me wants to give up, but the other part of me wants to get that PhD to prove to myself that I can.  I just don't know how to do it without feeling like a worthless piece of shit w no real friends to speak of.  It's also not that helpful that I have an existentialist worldview, so on one hand, my PhD and friends/family etc. really matter to me, but on the other hand, it can be difficult to ignore my belief that even the things that are really important to me are meaningless in the long run and that I can't trust/rely on anybody.

And yes, I've been seeing both a psychiatrist and psychologist for years, am doing CBT and am on medication (don't think I've found the right combo yet), am leading an active and healthy lifestyle (diet + exercise), but still, I hate myself and want to die (at times...I know it'll pass, but this up/down shit is fucking horrible).",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_1d7pnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1d7pnc/mental_health_issues_during_grad_school/,

She is enrolled in grad school and dealing with a less-than-ideal group for a very important project.  I'm hoping you guys will have some advice for her or anecdotes about dealing with group projects, and I apologize in advance because I'm sure this topic is brought up often.

Hers is a class where the grade is almost completely dependent on the project grade.  They have had about three months so far, and from the beginning her group was hard to deal with.  Now, in my MBA program (and I've heard most MBAs are like this), I had my share of group projects with some issues.  The surprising thing about her group is that most of them fall in the category of ""I just want to do the minimum work required and pass the class.""  I was shocked to hear that this kind of attitude could persist in grad school.  Here is the summary of the people involved:

Person 1: Lives and works full-time in another city about 30 minutes away. Didn't even want to be in this area of study (so why is she?).  Explicitly said she just wants to be done with the project with a minimum amount of work and just get a C.  Comes to no group meetings.  Semi-finished project was sent to her so she could add her part (which she should have had already but apparently didn't) and send to professor for feedback.  This was done three weeks before project due date to give professor a week or so to reply and then they would have a few weeks to work with the feedback.  She sat on it for a week and a half and finally sent it to prof.  Because of this the professor's feedback will be pretty much useless as it will be received (if at all) a day or two before the project is to be presented.

Person 2: Studied the same thing in undergrad but somehow knows almost nothing about it.  When my girlfriend suggests that they have a meeting to discuss things or that they need to do X or Y as the project guidelines state, she responds with something like, ""We shouldn't inconvenience Person 1 as she has to drive here to campus so we should have very few group meetings"" or ""Do we really have to do that part? I think we don't have a great project but none of us have time to do that.""

Person 3: He is quite apathetic about everything.  During a group meeting in our apt, I overheard him saying to GF ""I like how you are so serious about your work. Me, I just don't really care about it.""  Finally started to show a glimmer of caring about a week before it was due, giving the group a speech about how he was worried because ""this project is worth a lot of credit hours guys, let's get serious about it!"".  However, now during my GF's last chance push to make the project actually decent during this final weekend and in the face of all the other group members settling for the project the way it is (hint: not good), this guy reveals that he made plans for a friend to come from out of town to hang out for the weekend!  Consequently, he says he can meet on Sunday evening to work on the project.  The project is to be presented Monday to not only the professor and class, but also to the client for whom they are doing this consulting project!

Personally I have never encountered people like this in a grad school setting.  I feel like they would be common in high school and undergrad.  This makes sense, since a lot of people just go to college because their parents made them, or they may be in classes they don't care about for gen ed credits.  However, I expect people in grad school to be a lot more serious, as they had to make a personal decision to leave the workforce and go back to school to study a certain subject. Also they are older so I expect they would be less childish.  I have two questions:

1.  Have you dealt with apathetic grad students who inexplicably don't seem to want to be there and just want to scrape by? How did you deal with working with them?

2.  What advice can I give to my girlfriend to help her save this looming unfinished project and not get a bad grade in this class? It's a six credit-hour class.

I had a really rough time in undergrad and emerged completely traumatized (for reasons unrelated to my professors or classes), so I've spent the last year working a glorified admin job. 

The problem with this is, I've realized that I'm just miserable without some serious intellectual life. My job is dull and largely boring, but it does involve very long hours, so I don't have much time or energy for anything else. In my free time, my favorite things to do are read huge books full of big, important ideas (Churchill's history of WW2, The Wealth of Nations, Tacitus' Annals, etc.) and talk about them with anyone who will talk to me.

I love reading about these historical/political ideas and seriously thinking about them. But I'm realistic enough to know that nobody is going to pay me to do that just because I want to! I know the job market for humanities degrees is abysmal, so I want to make sure I have an actual plan and reason other than ""I want to feel fulfilled as a human being,"" because that, unfortunately, doesn't pay the rent.

Currently I'm thinking about aiming at a job with a think tank of some kind - is it reasonable to apply to MA programs in History/PoliSci with this in mind? Or should I have a fully-formed career path in mind before I start looking at programs? Do I have any chance at a History/PoliSci program to begin with?

The only thing I can say with pride is I've already read my Robotics textbook entirely through, and am halfway through it a second time. I've also done a halfway decent job of keeping up my exercise routine.

It could just be that all of my friends have dispersed to different corners of the country so there's a couple to hang out with in different cities but no central location.  Additionally, pretty much all my FWB at home have run out so that's driving me nuts as well.

I'm supposed to go rock climbing with friends this weekend for the first time so I hope that'll be fun.  It's just strange that I look around and it seems like everyone else is having more fun than me, more adventure, etc.  I don't know if I just need to be more pro-active in looking up stuff to do, or what...  is this a common problem for people?

I was a humanities major/major in my undergraduate study. My grades were not the best, having gone through one or two crises as a freshman, and it was hard to recover from my first year and half. A couple years after undergrad I got a job with smaller division of a very large international company. I'm in the Marketing department and do a lot of writing, social media, basic html, copywriting, etc. My job is great; decent starting salary for someone with no work experience in the field and full benefits, including tuition reimbursement. 

I have always wanted to go grad school, and it is only possible for me now since my company will reimburse 75% of my tuition. There's a Master's of Science in Communication program at a state college nearby that I've checked out and think might be a good program for me to further my knowledge and improve my future job prospects. 

There's a catch. I have to continue working full-time (40 hours/week) while getting my degree part-time. I must maintain a C or better in each of my courses. When I complete my degree, I won't be able to leave the company for another 2 years, else I have to pay all tuition back. I'm also committing myself and my SO to this area for the next 5-6 years, and I'm not sure I want to remain here for that long. 

For those of you that got degrees while also working full-time, how did you manage it? My job isn't particularly stressful and I believe they would be flexible with my schedule and allow me to work from home a couple days a week. 

If I already work in Marketing/Communications, is it worth it to get my Master's degree?

I recently graduated from Arizona State University (in May) with a degree in Political Science (BS), Minor in Sustainability, and a certificate in International Studies. I graduated with a 3.63 gpa (Magna Cum Laude), and I am currently working in Sonora (Mexico) for a company which specializes in manufacturing radiators (heat exchangers) for mining machinery  (http://www.mesabi.com/).

I plan to be here for around a year to a year and a half to get experience for an MBA program (still undecided as to whether I will go with finance, international business, or something else. 

At any rate I've been looking at the following schools and their MBA programs:

- My alma mater ASU WP Carey MBA program

- Eller School of Business (University of Arizona)

- Thunderbird School of Global management. 

I was leaning towards Thunderbird since I heard it was a very good reputation and program, but after doing some research it seems that WP Carey may have a superior two year program.

* We spend time to master a technique that our PI is an expert on. But this technique may have zero value in the job market. 

* When I write the introduction of my paper, I seriously doubt if that is going to happen. I am not an industry person so I don't have a real understanding on the bottleneck faced by the state-of-the-art. 

* The goal is to publish. Postdocs don't want to build instrument because they need to get papers in 2 years based on whatever available. 

* Because of competition in recent years, the quality of publication declines and number of publication explodes. I personally think that papers in old days were more detailed and carefully done. Because we publish more, we end up spending more time generating reports and passing reviewers, distracting ourselves from doing ""real science"" in the lab.

* Students have to solve whatever random problems that pops up. We learn in the progress, but just enough to barely (sometimes incompletely) resolve the problem. As a result, we do many different things, specialize in nothing and problems aren't always properly solved.

* Little interaction with industry. I am pretty sure that I am working on something industry doesn't give a shit about. Yet, I am stuck with a particular experimental technique and I have to keep doing it.

I am currently working with two professors for completely different research. 

Option A: 

 * Arguably, Prof A is *the* most prestigious scientist in his field.
 * He is a head of his group, a collaboration of 5 schools (~ 100 people, including many professors)
 * Exciting research, something I find very interesting. 
 * He has no one on one time for students. 
 * The local group is still big, with ~20 people. 
 * Unlikely to have major contribution in a group unless I am REALLY GOOD.
 * The group is very productive. 
 * Easy to get a post-doc in this field but nearly impossible to get a faculty position. Some postdocs in our local group is at their 3rd, 5th and 12th year!!

Option B: 

* Prof B is a recent tenure professor, still very energetic.  working on a different field.
* I work with him all the time, I can meet with him one-on-one whenever I want basically. 
* After working with him for almost 2 semesters, we're about to publish one paper (possibly two if we decide to split the work into 2 papers)
* there are no groups, just him, me, and another graduate student. 
* He didn't have many student, aka data points for me to judge what my future will be like after my phd. However, he did have one student graduated, now a postdoc with a very good fellowship at a top school 
* he is sometimes too pushy and too energetic 
* I know more about his research, and I am better at it (now). but less excited compared to prof A's.

First of all, I hope it's OK to be posting this here. I'm currently freelancing and looking for additional work, so I thought I'd check out r/gradschool to see if anyone is in need of an audio/video transcriber. My rates are generally around $0.50 - $0.80 per audio/video minute (depending on type of transcription, audio quality, number of speakers, etc.) which is a lot cheaper than most transcription services and companies. My turnaround time is 1 to 1.5 hours of audio per 24 hours, with the possibility of a quicker delivery if it's absolutely necessary.

I have about two years of experience. From January 2009 to March 2010, I worked as a transcriber for a research organization affiliated with the university I attended. My work primarily consisted of transcribing lectures, interviews, and focus groups. As of August 2012, I've been transcribing in a freelance capacity. I've since worked on a wide range of projects and have gained additional experience transcribing podcasts, seminars, and meetings. I currently have a 5 star rating on Elance and 40% of my clients have used my services more than once due to their satisfaction with the work I provided.

Additionally, I have a BS in psychology and political science and I'm finishing an accelerated BSN program. As a result of my educational and transcription background, I have a working knowledge of academic, scientific, medical, corporate, and legal terminology. At the present time, most of my work comes from academic research projects across all disciplines.

Transcription specifics:  
- Typing speed of 80+ words per minute  
- Mastery of relevant computer programs and file management  
- Outstanding listening and research skills  
- Quick turnaround and prompt phone and/or e-mail response time  
- All inaudible words and phrases are time-stamped for easy review by the client  
- Both the verbatim and clarity styles are available and the work is always tailored specifically to the client's needs and requests  
- Formatting and use of symbols changed for each client, as per his/her guidelines  
- All work is thoroughly proofread before delivery

Political science or international relations would be really interesting but I'm not sure who to talk to/where to go to learn more about those programs. Any help would be **GREATLY** appreciated!! Thanks!

I'm a second year PhD student in Biology. I feel like I can't communicate with my adviser because he is overworked and has a nasty temper, and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him. I am sick of coursework and not doing well in one of my classes (another thing that will set my adviser off), or well in my courses in general (I've gotten a mixed bag of B+/B-, an A or two and one C? in an awful stats course). I've gotten no successful research done, partly because the previous grad student on this project was very disorganized and left a mess. I feel like I get very little guidance from my advisers despite having the official one and 2 co-advisers, all of who seem less than enthusiastic about me. 

Long story short, I am extremely unhappy and have spent most of the past 5-6 months depressed. It's incredibly disheartening to have 3 advisers but no mentor--someone who cares about me as a person and not just about my failures--and I'm seriously considering leaving at the end of next semester when my boyfriend graduates. He is the only reason I got through the summer with any sort of sanity and I honestly can't imagine doing another 3.5 years without him. So these are my questions:

I initially applied for grad school because I loved learning, loved interacting with my professors as an undergraduate, and I believed I wanted to become a professor as well. Academia appealed to me because I enjoy teaching and I enjoy communicating science to others... but between the dearth of jobs in academia I'm always hearing about, plus the long, hard road to a tenured position at a teaching college (PhD, tenure track, not to mention any post doc positions you might have to take), it's starting to look less appealing. 

An alternative career I've considered is science writing or science journalism since it would also involve keeping track of the literature while digesting it for a popular audience, but... 

If I leave, how difficult will it be to find work? I don't think I'm in the position to complete a research dissertation within the next semester, which (as it's been suggested to me by my adviser) would involve publishing a paper. How bad does a non-research based M.Sc look? What if I ever decided to go back to graduate school again?

And if finishing with a Masters would involve staying a semester or two beyond the spring, which I feel like I can't do right now, what if I left without one? As someone with student debt, who came from a family with debt problems, the thought of having no guaranteed income makes me sick to my stomach, but I'm also miserable right now and constantly find myself daydreaming about getting out.

I've been wanting to go back to grad school for a long time. I have a good paying job with excellent benefits at a world renown pharmaceutical company. After being in my (manufacturing) department for 4 years, the itch to leave just grows stronger as time passes. Being on the production side of things was never what I had in mind after working my ass off in school. I've tried to get jobs in R&amp;D in my company as well as outside, with no luck. I've settled with the fact that I have to go back to school and get a masters in order to be a competitive candidate for the career that I want to be in.

I am clueless as to how to score admissions to a decent program...


-How can I convince potential admissions boards that I am a decent candidate after being out of school for 4 years

-I have a professor who I want to have as an author for my letter of rec. How can I approach him after being out of his radar for so long?

-I did take my GRE's... twice. My score improved only marginally (both scores are pretty average). With a not so stellar GPA (right about 2.98) what are my chances of getting an offer?

-How can I use working in manufacturing as a way to enhance my chances of getting into school?

-Should I find time to take classes at a local university and establish a strong relationship with a new professor?

Some details about my education:

I graduated with a BS in Biomedical Engineering at a west coast university. My grades sucked royally for the first two years due to misguided priorities and partying. Also, the program at my school was still fairly new, so it's not a very good program. Nevertheless I picked up for the last half of my academic career. I was able to get on the dean's list 4 out of my last 6 quarters. Most importantly, I spent a year in a tissue engineering lab during my super-senior year. I had a blast there, and had a great project but was not developed enough to be published. After graduating, I was desperate to find a job, and got into the current situation I am in now. I've determined that although my huge international employer takes pride in having a small-campus/inclusionary culture, those on the research side have a negative perception of manufacturing personnel (high school grads, shift workers, sloppy and non professional looking,etc.) and will only hire people from the other side for miraculous reasons...

**TL;DR:** Got a good job at a big pharma manufacturing plant, but always wanted R&amp;D. Want to go back to Grad School, but not really sure how w/ OK GPA and GRE.

Professor Herp,

I am a recent graduate of Derp University's materials engineering program, and will be starting my Ph.D. studies in the same department in the fall.  I took your tissue engineering class in Spring 2011, and really enjoyed the subject and the opportunity to write a research proposal on a novel tissue engineering idea.  I wanted to inquire about what direction you planned on taking your research in the next few years, and whether you would have any openings for new graduate students this coming year.

My intended research area is biomaterials, specifically the intersection of tissue engineering, drug delivery, and nanomaterials.  I have read many of your papers, and your focus on incorporating nanoparticles, developing tissue culture technologies, and exploring new biomaterials closely align with my research interests.  My current ideas revolve around the integration of nanoscale particles into scaffolds as a means of controlled growth factor or drug release, and the combination of nanoscale materials with polymeric materials for scaffolds with unique properties.  Additionally, the focus of my proposal for your class was prevascularization of craniofacial bone scaffolds for increased anastomosis, a topic which I would be very interested in exploring further.

If it would be possible to speak further about working in your lab, I have open availability starting June 18th to come in for a meeting or speak over the phone; please let me know what date and time would work best for you.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

1332513440.0,9,self.GradSchool,r9zy3,Rejected,vitaebella,12,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/r9zy3/rejected/,"Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone had any advice on what to do in the event of rejection across the board.

I'm currently finishing up my undergrad career at Michigan State University, and I'll be graduating in May with a BA in Psychology and a BA in English (with a concentration in Film Studies).  Last year around this time, I had decided that I wanted to pursue film &amp; media studies at the graduate level and started researching schools, working on writing samples, etc.  I ended up applying to 5 schools in December (Brown [PhD], UChicago [PhD], UW-Madison [MA], UIowa [MA], and IU-Bloomington [MA]).  I just received the last of my rejection notifications yesterday.  UChicago accepted me to a Humanities MA after rejecting me from the Cinema &amp; Media Studies PhD, but the program is a cash cow.  The total cost for 9 months runs about $50,000 and they're not offering funding.  Seeing as I don't have a rich uncle willing to foot the bill, I'd be a fool to put myself into that much debt for an MA.  I apparently made it pretty far in Madison's deliberations, but they were only able to take 4 students and I ""missed the cutoff by a hair.""  All the rest were generic rejections.

Needless to say, I'm pretty crushed.  Stupidly, it had not occurred to me that I might be rejected by every school to which I applied, and now I'm sort of at a loss.  I have every intention of applying to programs again next year, but I'm not sure what to do with myself in the meantime.  I have never not been in school.  I've had classes every semester - including summer - since I started college, and the idea of not being in an academic environment is kind of freaking me out.

Those of you who have also been forced to take a year off, do you have any advice on what to do in the interim to gain an advantage for the next round of applications?  I'm trying desperately not to move back home because home is in the boonies, cut off from proper research resources (our public library is about the same size as my apartment) or even real movie theaters, which are kind of essential to my field, as well as my sanity.  The local theater shows one movie at a time, and it is always a family film.  The nearest multiplex is 50 miles away, and it's kind of a joke.  But, I digress.  Trying not to move home means getting a real job so I can keep my apartment at school, so that's on my to-do list.  Other than that, what do I do with myself until I start putting together applications again?  I'm going to work on getting a few pieces published in various film and media journals but other than that and re-taking the GRE, what can I do to make myself a really amazing/outstanding candidate?  

I guess I'm just looking for some guidance for other people who were rejected the first time around and had to take a year or more off.

I started working as an undergraduate researcher in the Spring with my now advisor and went straight into grad school after working over the summer.

My main motivation for going to grad school was because I wanted to stay around the town my school is at and didn't really want to find a real job yet.  I don't really have any interest in the research I am doing and only really got in because another grad student who TA'd a class I was in saw I did really well and more or less vouched for me when I applied.

I will probably get straight A's in my courses this term, but I just hate my job/research.  It basically consists of coding in MATLAB and I realized a while ago that I am always depressed when I come to work.  There are really only two things holding me back:

* I don't really have a plan for what I would do if I left.  I really liked being an undergrad and went to grad school because I thought it would be similar and I am not looking forward working a 9-5 job.  Part of me wonders if I just need to get used to working, and if I should stick with it because the alternative wouldn't be any better.

* I am in the middle of a project that I have been working on since I started research in March.  I am sure I could just up and quit, but I would feel like a dick because it would be really hard to pass off my work to somebody else.  There is a deadline on this project, which is March of next year, so I have considered just finishing out this next term if I wanted to leave.  However, my advisor plans to have me start another project within the next month or so, so if I did plan on leaving, I wouldn't want to get started on that.

Should I quit, or maybe see if I like this new project and want to stay?  I feel that if I do quit, I should probably do it after my first term or two, and not wait until I am a year+ down the road.  Is this possibly a ""grass is always greener"" situation, where working a job could be just as bad?  Part of me is scared to admit that I might not even really like engineering, and it was just something I was good at so I did it.  If that is the case then I don't even know what to do.  Even though having a degree in a science field is big, I would still feel as though I have largely wasted the past 4-5 years of my life.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_n5c67,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/n5c67/grad_school_might_not_be_for_me_should_i_quit/,

So basically, my parents paid for almost everything for undergrad- which was fantastic, and I'm so, so, so lucky and grateful that they were able and willing to do so. However, that also means I've never gone through the FAFSA/loan process before, so I'm completely and totally lost. 

I understand that as a graduate student I am only eligible for unsubsidized loans. That sucks, but it is what it is. 

So I filled out the FAFSA application, then I received a confirmation email and then later a ""FAFSA for 2013-2014 processed successfully"" email. In that last email, in the ""what happens next"" section, it says that my information will be forwarded to the school, then they will let me know if they need more information, and that I should contact the school with any questions regarding my financial aid package. 

That email was sent to me on April 17th. I have not heard anything from my school since then. Maybe this timeline is normal- if so, I'd love for someone to let me know. 

I contacted them several weeks ago now to check on the status, and the student worker there told me that I should be receiving a letter in the mail ""any day now"" about the next steps. I work full time during the week, so I have had a hard time making time to call, but I will definitely be calling Monday to find out what's going on. 


Does it sound like I'm on the right track, or does something sound totally amiss? 

Also, I am going to be a TA, and that covers most of my tuition and provides a small stipend that works out to cover a significant portion of my rent, but nothing else. Seems to be a rather generous package for a masters student in my field from what I heard during interviews, so I'm not particularly disappointed by that. Anyway, the point is that I only want to borrow what I need so I'm not accruing interest on money sitting pointlessly in the bank. I'm allowed to accept only a portion of a loan offered to me, right?

I just love science.
Frankly, the only reason I would get a Ph.D is for the sense of accomplishment (and the title, obviously.) But ultimately, I think I'll find my place in an industry environment.

So I guess I'm asking if these reasons are enough to actually endure another 5 years of academic only to end up in industry, or might it be best to just jump into a career after my MA, and in 5 years, I'll likely be making about as much as someone with a brand new Ph.D.

I have a general question for you...I hope maybe someone can help.  Here is a little back story.
I graduated with my BSEE in 2009, couldn't get a good job so I talked to my adviser from senior design about going to grad school.  He ended up having some openings in his lab so I took and RA/TA assignment from Fall 09 to Spring 11 when I finished up all my course work...Long story short I got a great **PAYING** job offer and never finished my thesis, so I do not have my MSEE after those 2 years...  It sucks, I kind of hate myself for it and worse...I really don't like my job very much.  It is boring and requires little to know knowledge.

My question is:
Do you think its feasible for me to try and go back full time as an RA/TA assignment to at the very least finish my Masters.  I am unsure on whether or not a Ph.D is for me but what I can tell you is I liked grad school and I really liked TAing.  I would love to take more classes, even though they are not required for my MSEE (all classwork is done), and even others that could help me in the future.  I don't know how I should approach my adviser to see if he has an lab openings.  I am willing to do the RA/TA assignments and look forward to it really...I just don't know.  Any ideas?

This year will be my 5th year applying for a PhD. I’m not sure what I am doing wrong that I can’t get into anywhere. I have two master’s degrees (unfortunately no thesis and done online). I have had multiple interviews, but never any acceptance letters. At one interview, I was told that I had well written personal statement (unlike this post) and that my ideas for a thesis are great. I’ve also been told several times that I am very qualified. After one interview, I contacted the university, and I asked what my status was. They told me that, although my ideas were good and I was qualified, what I wanted to do could not be done at that university. I want to work on specific project that combines different disciplines (basic idea: using systems biology to discover how cancers escape the immune response).

Stats:

Undergrad GPA: 3.2
Master’s GPA 3.5 -3.7 depending on the calculation
Research: Undergraduate chemical research (didn’t really feel like I was doing much independent thought and contribution, but maybe that’s how most undergrad work is), and an internship (doing basic lab work)
GRE: Quant: 70 something percentile, Verbal: 90 something, Writing 3.0 (kind of messed that up)
References: Undergrad professors and masters professors

Now that you’re filled in what should I do? 

Should I retake the GRE or is it not that important (to me my quantitative score is low for the field I want to join)?

I’ve been trying to find US PIs that fit my research, but haven’t found something that does both the systems biology and the immunology part of what I want to work on for a thesis. Do I need to find somebody’s lab that does pretty much exactly what I want to do, or how does that work? Also, how does funding of a project work for a PhD student?

How should I go about applying for fellowships?

Do I need more research experience, and if so how do I get it?

Should I contact professors and offer to do volunteer work for their lab, or does that come off wrong?

Is there anything else that I should do or know about to get in to a PhD program?

(In reference to a master's in microbiology),metronome2012,12,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/18q7lf/what_is_handholding_in_grad_school_in_reference/,"Hi all.  I'm applying for my master's in microbiology in specific labs and just got back from an interview weekend where I got to meet with my potential advisor and some of his lab members.

I didn't really get a lot of time to speak with the grad students (since they're all super busy), but some of the comments one of them said made me feel a bit wary.  The PI is super busy and is the 'superstar' of the department.  He doesn't do lab work or mess with the 'day-to-day'  process (which seems to be pretty typical).  I asked the grad student (PhD) how much time he spends with his advisor and how independent he was.  He replied that 'grad school is very independent in general and there is no hand holding' and 'grad school is what you make it'.  These statements made me feel a bit weird.  I understand that grad school is very different from undergrad and the research is INDEPENDENT research so these statements are overall true, but that said, comments like that don't seem to be reflective of an overall supportive research environment.  I did find out later from the PI that he meets one-on-one with students every other week and has a group lab meeting every other week as well (consisting of 2 post-docs, two PhD students, a lab manager, and ~7 undergrads)... so there seems to be considerable amount of contact (yet the PI admitted he doesn't spend enough time with his students).

I guess I'm wondering... what is considered 'hand-holding'? I keep hearing how different advisors have different advising styles... some may be perfectly content to let their students flounder with little to no direction, advice, or support (and they claim this is fine because if the student needed anything more, then they're not cut out for science) while others think of the thesis topic, design the experiments, are super critical, and so on. So... what exactly is independent?  Is there a line somewhere? Some people may do well in more 'structured' environments with set goals and such while others want complete freedom... but I guess I'm wondering if there is a general level of acceptable/expected independence?

Personally, I have only had one summer of full-time research experience (hence why I'm going for a master's at this point), and I WOULD like a more structured environment, at least in the beginning (ie help with designing my experiments, choosing a working hypothesis, if I have a question, can get it answered).  Ideally, with time and work, I'll be able to develop into a competent, independent scientist that can design their own experiments and come up with relevant research questions, but frankly I'm not there yet. Am I asking for too much?  Is what I want hand-holding? Should I work as a tech in a research lab first before going to grad school?

They do amazing work, publish in top tier journals, and are highly productive.

I got paired up with another grad student for my rotation. I see this person around the lab, but they (and everyone else in the lab) are doing something different, using different techniques etc. The nature of the work is new to me, and the direction I'd like to move. When I ask for help, I'm not rebuffed per se, but the impression I get is that it is reluctant. The PI is brilliant, but not very active/involved/enthusiastic-appearing. 

Honestly my impression is that I'm not at all important, that my work isn't important (it will either get done or not or someone will get around to it at some point), and that I'm expected to ""go-it-alone.""

This might be fine, but resources (equipment, time, etc.) are scarce, I don't feel productive, and I'm not learning. That is probably 80% my responsibility, but my disappointing experience is definitely impacting my motivation/mood etc. I spend about 60 hours/week in the lab, and it's exhausting. I'm not doing anything socially.

It's an insular group that isn't very warm, open, or talkative. I don't feel at all like I belong. I've started avoiding people in the lab, and my negative affect is spilling over into my general social life to the point that I shun hanging out with anyone. I'm normally incredibly gregarious but this disappointment is really taking my world for a spin.

So now that I've established that the lab I thought I wanted to work in, that does *exactly* the type of research I wanted to do, is a majorly inappropriate fit for me, what's to be done? 

The other PI's I contacted when I applied, and those I interviewed with, initially said they intended to take students. They now tell me they do not.

My prospects are ending up in a lab I'm either tangentially interested in, or not too impressed with their work (either the quality or the impact).

Advice? On the off chance that I somehow get invited to stay in the lab, do I stay to do the work I want to do, despite that I hate being there? I'm worried that this is my shot at doing the research I want to do.

I'm pulling top marks (highest grades in each class of my program), and I'm not stupid. I work well independently, but there's no structure and little to no guidance in complicated area of my field I don't know much about.

I work in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) field as a first year doctoral student. My professor is brand new to the university and to being a faculty member, trying to start up his lab. He started with me early this summer, then added another member who is a 4+1 master's student (thinking about continuing to Ph.D.). We're both women.

This week, a new masters student arrived at the university (newinternationalgrad (NIG)), looking for a home lab. He is choosing between our lab and another professor's lab. NIG has plans of switching from masters to doctoral next semester and wants to finish quickly to go on to a M.D. program - according to him . My adviser asked us to form an opinion on NIG when we meet. I had met NIG in classes and he seemed nice, but then we went to a grad student mixer with the rest of our department and he turned into a chauvinistic pig. Every comment to/about a girl was based solely on how hot or not she was. I disliked his overly friendly overtures, but we were at a mixer with alcohol and causal talk, I could deal with that.

What made me really uncomfortable is that when I was showing NIG our lab and mentioned my labmate, his first and only question was, ""Is she hot?""  Along with his view/treatment of women (I felt like all he saw was my sex and nothing else), I also got the feeling from his talking that he is not sure what he wants and is just passing time until he figures that out. My new lab doesn't have the time or funding to babysit someone.

I want to communicate to my professor that I don't think NIG will make a good partner with women, but I'm not sure how to say it. My adviser and I are still getting to know each other so I don't want to make it sound like I won't work with any male (in my field, that's laughable).

I know I want to stick with biology/life science disciplines, not really into medical research, but open to exploring it. I want to choose something that has good job prospects, will pay well, and has a good program in the western US or Canada. I don't care much what I study; I'm more interested in the questions being asked than the subject being studied. Ultimately I want to be an academic researcher at a university. 

For reference, my research/lab experience includes: forest ecology, stream/fisheries, avian habitat selection, avian population dynamics, wildlife conservation, genetics of salamander chemical communication and sexual selection, seasonal coastal upwelling, effects of ocean acidification and climate change, competition and population dynamics in intertidal communities, and my publication was on genetic techniques in avian conservation. And I currently work in an organic chemistry lab. 

So, I would enjoy anything that even remotely relates to any of this. Maybe I'm over-thinking it, but I just want to be sure I make a smart choice. I'm a new family-man so I have a little bit of extra pressure on nowadays. What are some good options/programs you guys would recommend?

A few weeks ago, I finished teaching my first class. I got a very low overall below average rating for the course, inconsistent with previous ratings I had received as a teaching assistant. Here's the background:

I worked my ass off on lectures and was attentive to students. With a week and a half of class left, my dad died. I was devastated, and went home immediately. I left lectures for my teaching assistant to do, and only returned to give a final review and the final exam. I overestimated how much my students got from the TA's lectures, and I tried to make it clear that all material was fair game for the final, and I wasn't exactly in a great state of mind. I gave a final exam that most thought was way too hard.

1332895081.0,8,self.GradSchool,rgqlt,Thesis lab change? Scared. (xpost from r/LadiesOfScience),Throwaway_gradschool,10,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/rgqlt/thesis_lab_change_scared_xpost_from/,"I need your help, r/gradschool. I am confused, scared, hurt, anxious, and everything in between.


TL;DR - PI is trying to convince me to quit grad school. I have never been so sure that I want to, and can do this. Thus I am going to change my thesis lab, three years into grad school. I don't know what is going to happen, and I'm scared.


Long story short, I am thinking about dropping out of my thesis lab after spending two years in it. Am I dooming myself forever by doing this?!


I am a third year PhD candidate. My main issue is with the PI. He basically thinks that I picked the wrong career, and I should quit grad school right now. I am 200% positive that he is wrong, and the thought of actually quitting grad school never entered my mind - and that's all the while being acutely aware of today's ""situation"" in academia. Now, he is a lousy mentor - there is very little intellectual direction given, moreover I am on an ""orphan"" project so that I don't even have others to consult in the lab. I agree that yes, some people in the lab are able to function like postdocs, and admittedly I am not at that level yet. I'm definitely not the star student and I do not pretend to be, either. But... Aren't I here to learn this stuff?!


There is a long backstory of conflict here, but basically I cannot learn and grow under this PI. Whether he likes it or not, I'm moving on. I'm not sure what his reaction will be when I tell him that I am merely moving labs and not leaving school. I am really hoping that he at least supports my move, but who knows... Now, I already passed the quals. Can they kick me out of the program if he insists that I am unfit? His reasoning is anecdotal and far-fetched at best. e.g. He asked me what I like to read on a saturday night, and I answered current affairs. I love my NPR. Well. He told me that just for that answer, I should not go on any further. That if i were meant to do this, science literature relating to my topic is all I should ever want to read. Of course I read other interesting news articles besides journal articles. Does that mean that I am not tickled by science news, or that I don't like to read the literature, or that I am unsuited for this career? I don't think so. He definitely had one scenario in mind and was giving me ""examples"" to see that I should quit. I just don't see it. He also treats people very differently, and as the only student in the lab without funding, I find that I am treated quite differently than other students with funding. He is not enthusiastic about submitting a grant with me either, so.... I'm lost.


To be honest, I had a very hard time passing my quals. I was encouraged (by him) to quit then, and honestly it would have been super easy to quit then. Hell, considering the postdoc job market, the smartest thing to do probably WAS to quit. But I carried on,fought hard, and passed. Moreover, I had a very tough committee and I am quite sure that they would have failed me if they saw that I was totally unsuited for grad school as my current boss seems to think so.


I should have done this right after passing my quals, but at the time I was still (foolishly) hoping that he will start to see me and treat me as a hard-working, eager student with potential whom just need to be mentored and groomed. 


Last time he gave me this talk, I doubted myself. I wondered, oh, maybe I really don't belong here. However, after spending another year in the trenches, I'm more sure than ever that I do belong here and can do great things, if trained to my full potential. I am just hoping that it is not too late to try to find a mentor who can do just that... 


Sorry about ranting... I just need some words of courage from you guys. I will fight with him, and the school, until I can find another thesis lab that can actually TRAIN me. I'm scared to have to make this big change after two long, long, long years, but I will not give up my destiny because I don't fit someone else's unrealistic idea of what a perfect student should be. Of course, it was my fault that I chose the wrong lave and the wrong PI, but things looked a whole lot different when I first joined.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,True,,,True,t3_rgqlt,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/rgqlt/thesis_lab_change_scared_xpost_from/,

Some of you might have seen [this post already on r/AskAcademia](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/qz8br/new_website_academia_stack_exchange/), but I thought it could be worth also posting it here, since I've seen many questions that could be relevant. 

So I'm involved in [AcademiaSE](http://academia.stackexchange.com), and I thought I could do a bit of promo here for this site. 

The pitch is:
&gt;This site is for academics of all levels—from aspiring graduate and professional students to senior researchers—as well as anyone in or interested in research-related or research-adjacent fields. If you have a question about...

&gt; * Life as a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, university professor
&gt; * Transitioning from undergraduate to graduate researcher
Inner workings of research departments
&gt; * Requirements and expectations of academicians ... 

&gt; then you're in the right place!

I'd say that it's a bit wider than r/Gradschool, since it tackles Academia in general, but if you have precise questions about grad school, you're free to come and ask them there, and to join the community!

I don't think I have felt this way in a long time and I am not certain if I need to listen to my feelings, or if there is something very irrational and unhealthy going on that I need to power through. Reading through the subreddit, I feel like many of you have had experience with such moments.

I am coming directly from my bachelor's degree. During that time, I did research with a professor at a neighboring university (so on my transcript, I did not ever attend the university at which I was researching). I truly enjoyed my work and I'm an author on two pending publications, both to not insignificant journals. My PI was  something of a workaholic but we had a great working relationship, and we have certainly become friends in our own right as well over the years.

I began searching for a PhD program last year and I was given many great options. The institution where I'd been researching put up a ridiculously nice offer for me to stay- an extra $15,000 and the realistic chance of finishing in three years- and although they are not even close to a top 10 program, I felt excellent about the research I was doing, the collaboration possibilities, departmental support and my PI's standing in his subfield. Perhaps most importantly, though, I felt very involved and passionate about my research topic and it never felt like a chore to work weekends or nights. 

I was very stressed about making a decision. I got into the #1 program as well as many other ""big names"". I felt a lot of pressure to make a decision, and I just didn't know what to do. I was also really depressed at the time, and I am still having some issues with that. I ended up selecting a top 10 program that certainly looks worthwhile, but I am finding myself very angry/upset this summer and feeling conviction-less.

I have a number of concerns, and I worry that I made a decision based on the dogma of doing something new for newness' sake and the security of big names rather than on what I wanted to do as ""me"". But I might have also made the right choice. I'm just not sure. All I know is that I feel very upset and I'm having trouble bringing myself to even look at housing or moving. I can still change programs, as I have very close connections at the other university. But I'm afraid of cutting myself out of what might be a necessary change/growth that I am irrationally resisting. 

Top 10 School:

I would start over entirely new, have to do rotations, I'm not sure who I would end up working for or how I would feel about my research topic but I would be exposed to many new ideas and topics. It would take 5-6 years, the culture of the university tends towards larger labs (at least 15 people) and relatively infrequent contact with PIs (once a week). I would be extremely far from my family with prohibitively expensive airfare.

University I Know:

I could go right back to working on projects I really like and am personally invested in finishing, I would take courses but would not need to rotate, I could finish in 3 years with solid publications, I work great with my PI although he is on the overbearing side. Our research techniques are not mainstream and it is not likely I will be able to continue it elsewhere. I would be a few hours away from my family by plane. 

TL;DR: Help, I feel very upset and I don't know why.

For some reason unbeknownst to me, they RARELY admit master's candidates (according to their website and a potential advisor). I was told from a former professor that I might have to just apply as a PhD candidate and then leave once I receive a master's degree fulfillment. I also remember going to an ACS convention in which a speaker even recommended this to students who are considering graduate school.

What am I supposed to do? Several professors have emailed back saying they do not accept master's students to work in their lab. Not everyone needs to be a PhD and I find it ridiculous that they most likely will not even consider my application unless I say I am applying for a PhD.

So, stated simply, I don't know if I have the stamina to continue schooling. 
I just finished with a double B.S. (Geology/Geophysics, and Anthropology). I worked my ass off the past 3 years to get from a 2.9 GPA to a 3.6 (with about 215 hrs total). I overloaded each semester (15 - 22 hrs) and was intently focused on getting into a good grad program, pursuing a PhD and becoming a research professor at a large university. 

Well, without explaining the job outlooks for that direction, I just got done with an internship with a research professor and while I didn't hate it, I can't see myself enjoying that future. First off, way too much desktime, and programming, secondly, so little comes of all this effort. We had Wednesday ""learning"" days, and the researchers, grad students, and profs would bash all these recently published papers. Not sinisterly, but just, ""well, they're methods should be better explained here,"" ""What are they trying to say at all?"" You know, just making me wonder what the point of publishing is, if it's not even taken seriously. 
So, I am in a PhD program (starting in the Fall). And part of me just wants to fuck it all and go work at a coffee shop in a mtn town. Live for fun, and enjoyment. 
Another part says to get the masters, opt out early, and go teach at a community college in a mtn town. 
Third part says, I should finish what I got myself into, maybe I'll enjoy it after all. 

But the bottom lines are, the research prof route leads to stress, living in a place that is dependent upon job opening and your very specific field of study. And just seems so meaningless, so much research just never gets seen or talked about. 


Does anyone else share these thoughts? 

Can I actually drop out before starting?

I later accepted an offer from a top 3 engineering program in... the midwest.

I have a few advantages.  My bank account is cushioned enough that money will not be a worry for a while.  With my budget coming in under my monthly stipend I'm definitely not worried.  My car is brand new, it (hopefully) won't break down.  There's about a zero percent chance of me getting burned out.  I'm excited about the area and the school itself and my potential advisor has been solid ever since we started corresponding.

Conversely, this break from academia means that I'll have to crank these rusty gears and get my high-level thinking functioning at top notch again.  I haven't got research experience except for the 6 month period between jobs.  I've never had anything published.  However, my class schedule is a very tight block on Tuesday and Thursday. I literally have no classes Monday/Wednesday/Friday.  My plan is to immerse myself fully in the lab environment and spend as much time as possible getting valuable experience in my first semester.  I also have a lab or class to TA as well and could not be more excited about getting to teach.

What would be some advice that specifically applies to me as a person who has been out of the game for a couple years? Is it a good idea to be working ahead or should I take this summer between work and school and ""relax"" as some people have mentioned?  In what way should I work ahead?  How do I adjust to a lab as the new grad student and not piss off the other students?  What about grants?  There's so much stuff to know about just *being* a grad student that isn't taught, is there some resource for this?


I'm sorry if this is a textwall but this is an opportunity that had a rare chance in succeeding.  My undergraduate record was far from spotless and I went into applications acknowledging that it was likely I'd walk away empty handed.  When you fall off the beaten path and have to discover your own way back, it gives you a whole new appreciation for those doors that open up for you.  I think I'm mixing metaphors.  I don't care.

I met my adviser at a conference back in 2011, where we actually had a more friendly chat about hobbies and interests, rather then academic endeavors. I was immediately nabbed and recruited for this program by her. It's been one hell of a year (14 credit hours BOTH semesters, plus a 20-hour assistantship that's turned into a 40-60 hour workweek) and I'm exhausted.

During my annual review, she talked about what a fine worker I was: I was called 'dedicated, driven, loyal, and creative'. I was also chastised for my coursework grades (I earned some B's), that I will get to below. However, she then started asking me some questions. 

I should mention now that I'm 27, female, and in a steady, happy relationship with my boyfriend, whom I live with. My adviser is in her late thirties, in a long-distance marriage with a husband on the West Coast, and also has a commuter job on the East Coast (we're a Midwestern university). She has had some reproductive issues as well that she confided in me with. 

She then started asking me if a Ph.D was the right course for me; don't I want a happy marriage? Don't I want to start a family sometime soon? Additionally, she then started on about how she hates being a professor, and that she wished she left with just a Master's degree. Everyone she knows who left with a MS is now working for big companies and making lots of money, while she with her doctorate is stuck in academia. Do I want to be stuck in academia, never see my husband, never have children, and make a fraction of the pay that I could in the private sector? 

Additionally, she was concerned about my two B's I earned (despite earning A's in other courses). I hate that my program loads us with this crazy amount of coursework; in my Master's program, a full load was 9 credit hours, and a suicide-inducing-load was 12. (FYI: This term, I wrote three papers a week, designed a computer game, presented a poster, edited a paper that is now in a journal that I helped write, attended two conferences and a symposium, and designed a new curriculum for a local museum....all in one term! And they're on me about grades!)

My adviser then ended it with that she is tired of being a professor and that her job on the East Coast was an attempt to get out of it.  

I'm shocked and upset at this; she has never stated this to *any* of the other advisees or students. I was already thinking of switching programs at my university (I'm not accomplishing what I want with this program and I'm not excited about the research as much), and now I'm wondering if maybe my adviser is right, and I would be happier working in this private sector instead of academia. 

I have another meeting with her and our director of graduate studies on Friday. I'm trying to get my jimmies un-rustled and my thoughts in order. How should I tackle this? 

TL:DR; My adviser is unhappy as a professor, got uber-detailed about her personal life, and has advised me to leave the program because she doesn't want me to repeat her mistake.",,False,,t5_2r4r8,1369359762.0,,,True,t3_1ernqw,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ernqw/i_think_my_adviser_crossed_some_boundaries_and/,

I have been battling severe depression for the last 15 months and only now the fog is kind of lifting. I was towards the end of my PhD when my depression struck and as I was hospitalized for about 8 months I had to take an extended leave of absence. My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates. My depression was the result of certain repressed memories from my childhood (sexual abuse by my older sibling and cousin) making an unwelcome appearance in the conscious part of my brain. I went through intensive trauma therapy and had to work very hard to get back to my 'normal' life. Now that I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life I find myself in a ridiculous position where suddenly my career does not seem as bright, my once wide social circle has shrunk down to a core few and everyone is busy accomplishing things while I am stuck in one place. I feel like I am done with being in the lab 24/7. the past 15 months have obviously changed me as a person and my research which was a very big part of my life is no longer something I identify with. I no longer see myself doing a postdoc and working in academia and discovering brilliant things in my field. It was a very hard decision but I realized that I don't want to spend the next 10 years in a lab. Having said that I still love science and cannot imagine leaving the field altogether. I have an excellent bachelors degree and two masters degrees and lot of experience in labs around Europe. The things that still make me happy are editing my colleagues/students written works as well as promoting the exchange of ideas between scientists or students not just within my discipline but across the varied fields of science. I would love to join either a scientific journal/publishing house or manage an international graduate school. This is where I need your help Redittors, any suggestions of what kind of job I could look for. What career opportunities are available for someone who wants to remain in science but give up the lab.

I just discovered this subreddit today and was wondering if anyone could help with my issue. I am in my second year of my masters program currently and will be finishing come August when I defend my thesis. About a year into the program I was looking for employment but also told my current supervisor I was interested in a PhD. She said she would take me on if that was the route I decided on. I thought it was a great idea since I could continue off from the project I am working on, so began the process of applying for funding. 

Fast forward to about a month ago when I find out I was not awarded NSERC or OGS (yes I am Canadian). I get an acceptance letter for January start but it is conditional. My supervisor says that it was too short notice for her and she could not get any funding for me. She says she may be able to get funding in October and take me on for January start. 

Now I am torn for what to do. Do I stick around for an extra semester and work at a shitty job for a maybe in the PhD position or should I try to find employment? 

To complicate things further my girlfriend just moved from her home town to live closer to me and my best friend who I live with will be screwed and have to move back home if I don't live here. 

I guess I am just frustrated that my supervisor said she would take me on then when she finds out she can't get funding I am left hanging in the wind.

Sorry for the longass rant. Hope everyone's having fun in grad school or have gotten accepted somewhere!

This will be a bit long, but I really need some advice! I am a senior at a college ranked in the top ten. English/East Asian Studies double major, 3.9 major GPA. I applied to a bunch of really top English PhD programs, and unfortunately didn't get in anywhere (I haven't heard from NYU, Harvard, or Berkeley yet, but I'm assuming that if I haven't heard from them at this point, it's going to be a no...)

I did get offered a spot in the unfunded MA program at UVA though (my specialization is contemporary studies/Asian-American culture, so UVA is actually a pretty good fit from what I understand). Is it worth paying for an MA? I could also take a gap year and work some random job, but I'm worried that doing so won't increase my chances of getting into PhD programs the year after.

My worries hinge mainly on recommendation letters. Two out of my three rec letters are from my third year, so by the time I re-apply for PhD programs, these two will be two years old. And since my college doesn't have a strong focus in Asian-American studies in the English department (or anywhere), my current recommendations don't really speak to that specific subfield, and are from random classes on Psychoanalysis and Henry James...whereas if I got the MA, I'd be working with professors who actually do what I want to do. 

Money is the main issue here (obviously). My parents are willing to cover some of the cost, but most of it would be loans.

I started a masters in environmental science in June.  My first three months were working on a research project that I thought was going to be my thesis.  It turned out to be completely terrible: the other student on the project was a nightmare, the work was a nightmare, there would be short periods of very intense work (12-14hr days of hard manual labor) interspersed with long periods with absolutely nothing to do.  Top that with a lot of stuff going on in my personal life (relationship falling apart, transitioning from a small town to a city, which I've learned I hate), and it made for a really shitty summer.

Fast forward to now.  My advisor has been super helpful, and I'm now working on a different project.  My life has a more regular schedule, and I am beginning to adjust to the city.  However, I've come to a few realizations:

* I started this degree with the idea of getting a PhD.  
* However, I've lost the love of classes and learning that I had in undergrad.  
* Doing research has not turned out to be rewarding at all.  I'm narrowing down my thesis project and the thought of actually *doing* it next summer makes me almost ill.
* The only academic pursuit that I'm actually still enjoying or excited about is writing.  I may be helping my advisor write up some research from a previous project. 
* Before I started, the thought of specializing in a field was really exciting and was one of the reasons I did this.  However, I had my committee meeting this morning and realized that as we were talking about what field I wanted to pursue, I was filled with apathy. I've honestly never experienced anything but excitement when it comes to that kind of thing.  It was almost shocking.
* Sum all of this up, and I've been pretty solidly miserable on every day but the weekends.  So I'm seriously questioning whether the final goal -- being a professor or some such field -- is worth another 5-7 years of feeling like this.  
* Hearing my fellow students talk about career options with a masters in environmental science, I have not heard a single career option that I find palatable. And unlike some degrees like an MBA or even a law degree, I really don't have the impression that this degree will get me anywhere but further in the sciences.

I'm still making up my mind. But if I decide that a career in science is not for me, I'm really not seeing any reason to finish up this degree other than pride.  I'd *like* to be a professor; it's always been an exciting possibility for me, but it's never been my *dream*.  I've never really had a great deal of *passion* for it.  I feel like in order to go through that amount of hell, I'd need to **really really** want what's on the other side.

So, r/gradschool, can you help me?  I'd appreciate anything that will ground me or give me perspective.  I really want to hear the most arguments possible on why to stick with it.  Or if you don't think I should, tell me why.

PS: Some background: I have a TA, but it's not enough to cover my expenses. I spent two years working in non-profit and have a great deal of marketable skills in that area (I managed a program that brought in almost $1m with a staff of 45-50 student employees).  I am considering actively looking for jobs while I weigh my options, and if one comes along, I just might take it and drop out. 

**TL;DR**: Grad school is miserable and I hate it.  I don't want to do anything with just a master's, but 5-7 years is a lot to throw away on misery.

I’m going for my PhD in Experimental Psychology (Major: Neuroscience). I’ve been involved with my new lab for about a month now, and I feel somewhat intimidated by the techniques that are used (most of them are brand new to me), and I already feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. The research itself is very interesting to me, but neither of my projects in undergrad were related to this lab’s research goals. As an undergrad, I learned about very basic neurobiological and pharmacological processes in my upper-level psych courses, but I haven’t taken a pure biology or chemistry course since high school. On the bright side, it feels like I’m learning something new every day, and I’ve already given a presentation on a peer-reviewed article I read for a lab meeting, but I still feel I’m in way over my head! I realize this is probably a common feeling to have for a new grad student, but I’m wondering how long should I expect this to last, and worse, if this is the wrong lab for me. It may be too soon to tell.

Also, my lab colleagues seem very nice and have been very helpful so far. However, the PI seems very busy and somewhat inconsiderate (doesn’t respond at all to some emails, arrives late to lab meetings, is hard to track down, etc.) and in lab meetings he seems very intimidating, and he doesn’t seem to give praise out very much, if at all. I’ve heard he sets the bar very high, and goes by the motto “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” As a new student, this is kind of scary to me.

 I’m wondering: 1) what other people’s experiences are/were at the beginning of their graduate careers; 2) if this feeling of frustration is common; and 3) if you’ve switched which PI you work(ed) for, what were the reasons and did the switch work out?

Earlier this evening, I turned in a final research proposal for a course and within minutes of clicking ""send"" regretted it. I realized that I could have provided a different theoretical perspective to the experimental design, failed to include an interesting reference, and had a typo in a parenthetical citation. I have been working on this paper for weeks but have changed the proposal at least four times - the most recent being this morning, when I had an experimental design epiphany.

I have found that this is a common occurrence for me. When writing papers for courses, I continually update/alter my original theses, resulting in me almost always bumping up against deadlines. I could have a paper almost completely done (as I did yesterday), fall asleep, and wake up with a new realization for the paradigm and implications. When I do send things off, little details have escaped my attention and I feel embarrassment for the final product.

The only problem is that I need three letters of recommendation to apply. I've skimmed the internet and a few threads on AskReddit so far, but I have a specific question about getting them.

I graduated in December 2011. I spent the last couple years as a part-time student while I got my personal shit in order. I was never really a loud or vocal student, so I'm pretty sure not very many of my professors would remember me. I did have a couple that I had for multiple classes that *might* remember me.

One is a professor in my undergrad field of study, computer science. He might not remember me quite as well.
The other is a professor of physics that I had three classes with that I believe would remember me a lot more.

Another option that I've seen is to take a graduate class as a non-degree seeking student and get that professor's recommendation. (I should note that I work for a university and would have my classes paid for at this institution by my home institution; taking the non-degree class would only delay me by a semester for starting the actual graduate program.

Whose recommendation letter would carry more clout?

As this isn't directly related to admissions, I figured I would put this here.

I'll be going to public health school in the fall.  It's considered professional school, so you don't expect to be funded the way graduate students in the hard sciences do.  I have still nevertheless been pretty diligent about applying by scholarship deadlines and to scholarship programs, to see if I can get at least some money.  I've already been offered scholarships at a couple of schools.

The problem is that my top-choice school (for which I am, of course, out-of-state) appears to withhold any information about scholarships or merit assistantships until *after* the offer of admission has been accepted.  They have offered me admission.

Excerpt from my department's website: **""Department-based aid and other research and teaching assistantships will be available after an admitted applicant has accepted our offer of admission.""**

Does this seem unusual or off to you?  It strikes me as fairly odd that I wouldn't get to find out about any potential scholarships or assistantships available to me until after I've committed to going (and paying lots of money as an out-of-stater).  I've emailed the student services director of my department, but with no response.  I feel like I ought to call someone, just to be sure that they really don't offer anything to someone who has still not committed to enrolling, but I don't want to be the entitled whiner asking if they have any money for me as an incoming student.  Out-of-state tuition is a non-trivial amount of money and I do not want to be stuck with absolutely nothing.  At the same time, it's extremely well-ranked and I really want to attend.

It's basically left me in a bit of conundrum.  Other schools have already said, ""Here, we want to offer you money, and hope you'll accept our offer.""  This one seems to be somewhat secretive.  I keep thinking about accepting and seeing what kind of aid I can get, and then backing out if it's nothing.  This might result in a departmental blacklist or something; no real way of knowing.  I faced *nothing* like this in undergrad, where scholarship offers were made early and well in advance of accepting a school's admission offer.

I've read about post-baccalaureate programs, and I think this would be a great option for me, except they generally require a 3.0 minimum. Another option is attending CC and completing the pre-requisites but I read that medical schools look down on this option. Would they even calculate my pre-req grades into my GPA?

So, my question is, do I have a chance at being accepted into a medical school? How do I get to a place where I would be considered desirable?

Is that...OK?,penguinshooray,13,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1ijkfw/im_not_doing_that_much_work_in_grad_school_is/,"Background: I am in a thesis-based masters program in biology. It is a shorter masters since it's a contiguous BS-MS program (so I can graduate with a minimum of 1 year in my MS program). 

My project is a molecular phylogeny of a small group (maybe 15 species). This requires me to sequence 5 markers from 2 individuals from each species. In theory, I can fit all of those samples on about 3 plates to send off for sequencing.

I finished all of my labwork in the first 4 months of my MS program. Now I am learning the programs required to analyze the data. The actual learning how to use the programs takes the most time, but once I learn them, the analysis itself can be done in a couple of days.

I plan to graduate at the end of this year, which will be the minimum time required. All in all, I work maybe 20 hours a week towards grad school, especially since I finished all my lab work. I am not worried about writing the actual thesis, since I am a fast writer and the requirements are low (the average is maybe 20 pages). I am looking for part time work right now to fill up my extra time, especially since we're not given funding. I could do a side project, but I didn't get any of the grants I appied for and I have enough to graduate anyways.

The thing is...I feel kind of guilty. There are other students in the program in different areas of biology, like biomedical and animal behavior stuff, that are working 40 hrs a week for 2 years. I feel like I'm doing it ""wrong."" I work from home most often these days, since everything I need to do I use my laptop for. Working at home usually means I sleep until 11 and bum around until I decide to work. I am applying for PhD programs now, and I am actually looking forward to a full 40-50 hours a week. 

**tl/dr: I am in a short thesis based masters. I finished the bulk of the work early on, now I barely spend 20 hrs a week doing grad school related things. Am I doing it wrong?**

And just when it looked like everything was going to pay off, one of the reagents I use decides to stop working. I frantically order a replacement to the tune of $600, and that doesn't work either! All of that work, and I won't get a payoff until it's too late.

So, my end of fourth year committee meeting is tomorrow. My data is crappy. A lot of what I have been doing the last year is troubleshooting and optimization, and it's still not working. What can I tell them?

**EDIT:** So, they want me to pick up the pace of my research, and have another meeting in six months. I feel conflicted. Is this a satisfactory progress report or not? They said that the progress I made was acceptable, but there's a lot more to do, and they want to make sure I can generate enough data to base a dissertation.

1364599582.0,7,self.GradSchool,1b9ttk,Would really appreciate some advice for my specific situation... (Psych major) (x-post from /r/gradadmissions,ConfusedPsychMajor,8,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1b9ttk/would_really_appreciate_some_advice_for_my/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible.
I am currently in my junior year of undergrad pursuing a psych major and criminal justice minor. For the first two years of my college career, all my advisors and people I talked to told me to not even think about grad school yet, don't worry about choosing a major, etc. Now all of a sudden, I feel like I am not on track at all for grad school. High school didn't prepare me for college AT ALL. Before college, we were told everything we had to do and when to do it, and now in college we are expected to figure everything out by ourselves with little to no guidance from the school. I guess I didn't get that memo and now I feel like I've wasted the past 3 years of my life just trying to get good grades :(
On top of that, I am currently a Canadian in the US under an H4 visa, which basically means I am a dependent of my parents and cannot work at all, not even on campus or do paid internships. I am also limited in opportunities because i have no transportation (i know that sounds like a really lame excuse, but it is a legitimate problem for me...) to do internships or opportunities somewhere else such as our university's main campus.
But does working even really matter for getting into a grad school? I've heard so much recently about how they look at the research you've done. But what does doing ""research"" even mean?? I am attending a smaller branch campus of a good non-ivy league university, and I have no idea if they even do research here. I've also looked into doing some independent studies such as ""directed readings"" with a faculty advisor and a senior thesis, but do those count as research experience?
Basically, I am wondering how important is research experience when applying to grad programs, and how much do they usually expect you to have done? What kind of stuff SHOULD I be doing right now at this point in my academic career? I feel so behind compared to all these other redditors in the same year of university as myself :/
Also, since the only ""job"" experience I can sort of do is volunteer work, do volunteer jobs that are not related to my degree (working at a hospital, helping the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter) even matter at all to grad programs or should I not even waste my time doing that stuff?
Okay, I probably sound like an unambitious wreck right now, but I would really appreciate any advice or information you guys can give me. thank you so much in advance!",,False,,t5_2r4r8,False,,,True,t3_1b9ttk,http://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1b9ttk/would_really_appreciate_some_advice_for_my/,
