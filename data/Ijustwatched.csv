Given that John Carpenter's version is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time, I was very nervous about this prequel. 

Went in expecting total garbage, Hollywood trash, and maybe even someone literally taking a shit on the original's film reels. 

Verdict? Not bad 

The Good: 

- Excellent overall creature effects.
- Excellent tie-ins to ALMOST everything from the 1982 version.
- Mary Elizabeth Winstead played a solid lead character. 
- Movie ends with a helicopter flying to the American base, shooting at the dog. 
- You could tell in every scene (save the last 15 minutes) that the people making this were huge fans. LOTS of effort put into recreating as many scenes as possible from the Norwegian portion of the first film. 

The Bad:

- The atmosphere doesn't come close to the 1982 version.
- No music score to speak of, not even the ""heart-beat"" bits that made the first so great. 
- The last 15 minutes destroyed this film for me. It felt like the ""studio pressure"" ending. It didn't feel like the rest of the film, it doesn't work with the 1982 version and it just doesn't make sense. I hope there is a directors cut when this is released on Blu Ray that gives us an alternate ending that works. 
- The creature's ""abilities"" are enhanced in this version, begging the question what the hell happened to nerf it so badly in 1982 version. 
- You don't know what happens to 1 of the characters. BIG no-no IMHO. 

Unsure:

- LOTS of creature shots. Very little ""what am I looking at"". I liked it, others won't. 
- LOTS of action. This was an *agressive* Thing. No fucking around when found out or cornered. This creature was pissed the hell off from the get go. It hid in human bodies about as much as it was running around attacking people brute-force. 

Overall, I could nitpick this movie all damn day but overall, I enjoyed it. Is it my favorite film? No. Did it live up to impossibly high expectations? No. Did they produce a piece of shit for a money grab? I don't believe so. I was able to overlook lots and enjoy myself up to the last 15 minutes which left me scratching my head and pissed off that they dropped the ball so close to the finish line. 

IMHO If you take this movie on it's own, without comparing it to the 1982 version, this will probably end up being my favorite scary movie of the year.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_lauki,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/lauki/the_thing_2011/,

I know everyone just went nuts for this movie, but aside from fantastic cinematography I thought it was predictable and pretentious.   First, the plot was predictable from the beginning.  Natalie Portman's meekness and her mom's obvious control freak nature.  The director's constant pushing, her emotional fragility.  It just seemed obvious to me from the beginning.  It made it clear within a few minutes where the movie was headed.

Second, you could have pretty much swapped the Swan Lake plot point with any type of performance competition or even a job and the you could have kept the plot mostly intact.  It's not an original idea.  The only thing slightly original about it is that it was set around Swan Lake.  However, that just is a false veneer used to make it appear that the film is deep and existential, when really it's an old idea that has been done before and done much better.

It makes me sad actually, because I have always enjoyed Natalie Portman's work, but I just found her annoying.  The acting was absolutely fine.  In fact, wonderful performance from everyone.

If you haven't seen it and like sci-fi, I'd recommend it.  Essentially, a bunch of aliens land in a shitty part of Britain and the local gang of teenagers inadvertently start something of a ""turf war"" with the extra terrestrial beings.  Meanwhile, the gang has to deal with a human-on-human turf war at the same time, which makes for some very interesting parallels in the two intertwining subplots.  The leader of the teenage gang, Moses, goes through a coming-of-age experience while amongst the chaos of alien invasion.

There was some decent acting in it, though nothing spectacular.  The cavalcade of mediocre performances from supporting characters was tolerable, however, with the inclusion of Nick Frost as the drug dealer.  Also, the actor who plays the rival turf-leader wannabe is pretty hilarious and over the top (driving down the street aggressively headbanging to his OWN raps in a fit of angst, for example).  The film has some VERY impressive visuals, however, which I think is more important in some regards in science fiction.

Colin Farrell plays Ray, a young(ish) Irish hit-man who is new to the business and is not, as we learn, terribly good at it. He is probably in his mid-20s, but still displays the tendencies (and comical facial expressions) of a teenager; he’s a sulky little git who wants nothing to do with anything cultural, or anything not involving Dublin, women or drugs. He reminds me of [Kevin the teenager]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqm8JGnSshE). 

Ken (played by Brendan Glesson) on the other hand is an experienced hit-man who is an oasis of calm and authority. Ken loves culture and loves being in Bruges, whereas Ray fuckin’ hates Bruges, and every fuckin’ minute he spends there. Well, almost. Ray does manage to find some fun in the town (‘which is like a fuckin’ fairytale’) involving ‘two manky hookers and a racist dwarf’, and copious amounts of drugs. Somewhat surprisingly, Ken allows himself to become embroiled in this fun… because he’s had a very very bad day, and perhaps isn’t the completely sensible, responsible father figure we first thought. 

This is top class dark comedy, which, on my second watch, is far darker than I’d realised. The first watch (a year or two ago) had me belly laughing out loud; really, some of the things that come from Ray’s mouth are completely outrageous; the second watch allowed me to string it all together a bit more and appreciate that there is a sensitive soul with a terrible secret from his past behind the sulky little git who is Ray. 

If you like Hollywood endings where everything is tied up neatly, don’t watch this. If you like laughing uncontrollably at your screen, feeling like a terrible, terrible person for what you just laughed at, appreciating some good acting (I’m looking at you, Ralph Fiennes) and enjoying some beautiful scenery (remember: it’s like a fuckin’ fairytale), then please do watch this, and enjoy.

*The Shining* is a well-known Stanley Kubrick film, a horror tale set in a hotel that is mysteriously haunted (and perhaps supernaturally conscious).  It's a great movie, one that I enjoy more and more with multiple viewings.  But, chances are you know all that!

Following an idea in the documentary *Room 237* [(link)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085910) about *The Shining*, a local Tucson theater decided to make a special showing:  a simultaneous projection of *The Shining* both forwards and backwards, on the same screen.  Why?  Because Kubrick structured the film chock-full of ""reflections"":  mirrors in critical places, patterns that repeat symmetrically, duals and twins.  I guess someone noticed that the start and end of the film had some common elements, and wanted to see if they'd track all the way through.  Oddly enough *(coincidence?!?!)* they kinda do!

(Just to be super clear:  it's like if you had one screen, two projectors, and two prints of the movie, but one print was wound on its reels backwards.  You start both projectors, overlaying the frames.  So at first you're seeing the opening helicopter sequence on atop the backwards-flowing final credits, the final ballroom photograph, then the maze, etc.)

Whether or not it was intentional, it was engrossing and fun to watch, and gave me the feeling of discovering new things about a classic film I love.  Some of my favorite observations are below.  Warning -- they would be spoilers, if you wanted the thrill of discovery for yourself:

* [Jack's thrashing rage-dance down a hallway, before his first drink, aligns in the reverse film with his raging in the kitchen, flinging pots and pans on the ground.](/spoiler)  Very similar physical movements, but unlike anything else in the film.
* I never even noticed this detail before, but [do you remember Danny's fuzzy bear pillow at home in Boulder?  That precisely aligns in the reversed film with the appearance of the bear-costume dude.](/spoiler)
* I was really struck by one simple fact: that [the midpoint of the film occurs during Jack's sexy/gross Room-237 encounter.  So, when you watch it play out, immediately you see it play out again backwards.  It really makes you feel like you've reached the center of the Labyrinth, the locus of evil around which the film rotates and from which the hotel's evil radiates.](/spoiler)

So fun!  I bet it can be done at home (not *exactly* sure how) and I recommend it.

* Christian Bale remains a solid Bruce Wayne/Batman, no changes there.
* Michael Caine actually had some emotional scenes, a few of which were sampled in the trailers. He's a jam-up actor, so it's to be expected.
* The effects were pretty great, you could tell that Nolan tried to stay as far away from CGI as possible. The opening of the film is a straight up edge-of-your-seat affair. Soak it in.

All in all, the trailers really revealed almost nothing of the plot. It was a solid finale, which I'll probably end up seeing again in theaters soon.

Harry (Jared Leto) is a young addict living a spaced out life with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Tired of struggling from fix to fix the boys take it upon themselves to improve their prospects by making the switch from users to small-time dealers – but refusing their own product becomes their biggest challenge. Meanwhile Harry's mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn) has a lonely existence in her dark high-rise flat. Widowed and with only sporadic visits from her junkie son for company, she finds solace in grotesque TV infomercials hosted by repugnant Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald) in the manner of an evangelical preacher. Her aimless life is rejuvenated upon receiving a call that she’s been selected to appear on television, and becomes fixated on losing enough weight to wear a glamorous red dress from her youth so as to look her best. Several failed diets later, she turns to diet pills that draw her into spiralling addiction.

The film unflinchingly depicts helplessness and dependency, never beginning to hint at any kind of redemption or salvation and relentlessly pulling the characters deeper into their addictions. Not primarily driven by narrative, these stricken characters are simply presented to us – so we can share in their declines and aspirations. But unlike the characters we’re able to see how, while they remain fixated on their hopes and goals, drugs are tearing them apart. Although drug abuse is shown in the most negative of lights, it isn’t moralised about – there is no good and evil, just unfortunate souls consumed by their own sickness. It’s this ambiguity that makes ‘Requiem’ so effective. The crippling effect of addiction is apparent but it raises countless questions that it invites the viewer to analyse. The theme of dependency on a substance, but also friends and family is raised throughout – so even if the concept of drug abuse is far removed from our own lives the reliance on others will resonate with everyone. Indeed Sara’s core struggle is no longer feeling needed – “Your father's gone, you're gone. I got no one to care for. What have I got, Harry?”

This is a spellbinding piece of filmmaking with exceptional performances from all the cast – Ellen Burstyn in particular is remarkable as the vulnerable Sara - as well as frequently inventive cinematography and camera techniques that were groundbreaking on its release in 2000. Unfortunately the quick close up cuts of drug preparation and dilating pupils, and disjointed split-screen shots of conversations, have been mimicked and rehashed in everything from music videos to commercials. Still a great technical achievement, but as the film’s language has now passed into pop culture, its visual impact has been severely blunted. The same can be said for the music, a wonderful dark minimal score by Clint Mansell that sweeps over the jarring tactile images beautifully – but has since been repurposed as the theme for Sky Sports News (amongst others), creating an irritating distraction for any UK sports fans, especially as the main theme ‘Lux Antenna’ is such a prominent part of the film itself.

As with all Aronofsky’s work it engages physically as well as emotionally. He’s created a terrifying, grim world that feels entirely tangible, with close ups of bodies and skin that have the ability to make the viewer squirm in their seat. A thoroughly harrowing watch and an unparalleled study of helplessness in modern society, this is an exceptional piece of cinema.

The cast, the dark feel, getting inside someone's head who's not all there, and the time travel aspect were all really appealing to me. Plus, there's a lot of kick ass music, 80's era stuff as well as score-type music that gives the film a very nice, foreboding feel. I watched it with my wife and I think she liked it, at least she asked questions and discussed it afterwards with few complaints, which she doesn't do if she hates a movie.

The one thing I would say is to steer clear of the Director's Cut. In my opinion, it adds about 20 minutes of unnecessary fluff, either adding (in a bad way) to good scenes, or throwing in scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Also, the one thing I really liked about it the first time I saw it was that it left SO MUCH up to your own imagination to flesh out and figure out yourself, whereas the Director's Cut more or less serves everything up on a silver platter and takes away most of the intrigue (ie. the voiceovers in Blade Runner). 

Case in point: the Philosophy of Time Travel is never really dug into in the Theatrical version, so there's a level of information that Donnie is getting that we aren't, leaving it up to the audience to fill in the blanks. In the Director's Cut, entire pages of the book are shown on the screen, explicitly explaining what was happening in the movie, and the passages from the book are more or less nonsense and only make sense in the context of the movie so it detracted from the film for me in a big way (I guess the idea of the book is cool, I just wasn't a fan of the execution, a lot of it sounded like new age nonsense and the Theatrical version is almost a sci-fi movie since it omits a lot of that stuff and makes it seem like the book is grounded in reality and has scientific backing). If the book was included as an extra, either in physical form or as a Special Feature, I think that would have been cool but explaining every little detail takes away from the mysterious aspect of the film, which is the best part, in my opinion.

**tl;dr:** I'd recommend the *Theatrical Version* for viewing by anyone, I think it's an interesting take on time travel and the mental issues that everyone grapples with. I would give it an 8 out of 10, and one last time: steer clear of the Director's Cut.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_qd3vg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/qd3vg/ijw_donnie_darko_directors_cut_2001/,

My god is this a fucking dark film. 

I think I do understand it for the most part; Betty is a failure and projects her life the way she would see it, involving characters from her real life in a drug induced dream. I think this is one of Lynch's least confusing storylines, because of how well put together it is.  I can't remember the last time I saw a character as tragic as Betty. This movie is probably near perfection; it just feels right in so many ways I can't explain - this is why I'm so good at small talk. 

Somethings I don't understand: The key, the scary hobo and the subsequent death of restaurant patron, the geezers, and probably her kissing the fake Chamilla in the real timeline infront of Chad Filmington.

This is hands down one of the best films I have ever seen. The entire cast is brilliant, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and a scene-stealing Ralph Fiennes all on top form. Of course being what it is, the film is fully deserving of its 18 certificate, but if you aren't the type to be put off by earthy dialogue, you will find stunning and witty dialogue and genuine laugh-out-loud moments (though I cringe to write it). 

A film not only polished, but *original*, I almost passed it over as the adverts for it don't do the film any more justice than describing Blazing Saddles as a film about a cowboy saving a town from outlaws. Whilst that states what it is about, it misses the point and the adverts for *In Bruges* were the same. Even if you aren't normally a fan of gangster films this is so much more.  After finishing the film, I just wanted to watch it again, which never normally happens.

It was a real struggle this year and overall I felt it was a pretty lackluster year for film.

Anyway, here is a brief opinion of each, feel free to ignore...

The Artist - This was fantastic and really enjoyable; I wouldn't be upset at all if it won Best Picture. The people making it tried something brave, albeit gimmicky, and succeeded in making a fun and somewhat memorable movie. Singin' in the Rain is still a better movie telling the exact same story though.

The Descendants - I enjoyed this one. George Clooney was really good, but he is no Best Actor winner in this. Love the location in Oahu and Kauai; I can't wait to visit Hawaii again this May...

Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close - I felt like there was a good movie here that was completely lost due to the poor casting and poor acting on part of the lead child actor. Had this movie been made with the cast of The Tree of Life it would have possibly been great. Or even if just the child star had been the kid from Hugo, this movie could have fulfilled a possible potential and really have been something great. But, the kid sucked and the movie was damaged beyond repair because of it...

The Help - I enjoyed this movie a lot and felt it was great at the time, but I don't know, recently I have found myself thinking back to it and contemplating that it was a tad unbelievable and walked the borderline teetering into a sort of ""magical Negro"" fantasy. And yes, that is a real movie cliche, don't call me a racist...google it.

Hugo - On April 15th, 2010, I wrote as a status message on Facebook the following exact words, ""Martin Scorsese's next film is going to be a kid's movie in 3D? ARE YOU F-ING KIDDING ME?!? Come on!"" But I will eat my words, that f-ing kid's movie was incredible and beautiful and I loved it. Perhaps my favorite of the nine films. I will never doubt you again Mr. Scorsese, please accept my humble apology...

Midnight in Paris - Damn, when Woody Allen scores, he really scores and I just plain loved this one. It's not the best movie of the year. But for me, it was perhaps the most enjoyable and one that I will go back to just to lose myself in. Sweet and Lowdown is still my favorite Woody Allen film, but this might be a second...

Moneyball - Good movie and like the Social Network last year it presents a story that is still interesting even if you have no interest at all in the subject matter. I had no interest in the subject matter and I made it through this one without complaint...

The Tree of Life - I like to call this one ""Beautiful Bullshit"" or ""The movie for those who thought that 2001 was too fast-paced and action-packed."" This movie was a real chore to get through, but still I felt like there was a real movie here somewhere hidden in the crappy disjointed imagery and CGI dinosaurs. If they had just made a normally paced, heavy drama about Brad Pitt's family, it could have been excellent.

War Horse - Steven Spielberg needs to retire. He has taken what I assume is good source material and has turned it into a cliche-ridden mess. It's still better than his movie, The Terminal, but that one was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, so almost anything can be better than that.

Ok, so that's it. Hugo was I guess my favorite followed by Midnight in Paris and then The Artist.

I fully expect The Artist to win Best Picture.

I don't turn films off because of their content. At least, I never have before. I've seen some fucked up things in my time, but that was just wrong. I only had 10 minutes left of the film (if you've seen it, you'll know the scene) but there's no way I could continue.

I guess its whole point (in my opinion) is to shock, but this one takes it to another disturbing level. If that's your thing, you won't be disappointed, but I think it's honestly too much for the average viewer.

I suppose this is the kind of film that either interests you or outright sickens you. My personal recommendation, if you are simply curious after hearing about it, or maybe seeing the first film, is not to bother. I don't think mere curiosity will be enough justification for sitting through it.

From an objective point of view, I'd actually say it's better than the first film. The lead role was perfectly cast, the atmosphere and tone were suitably unnerving.

Bottom line? If you *know* you'll enjoy this film, watch it. If you have *any* reservations at all, it's probably best to avoid it.

EDIT: I wanted to add a little more after a few hours' reflection. 

I watched the first film on the recommendation of a friend. I knew nothing about it at the time and was expecting something more along the lines of a cheesy sci-fi/horror B-movie involving a 50 foot tall human centipede. I can't say the film affected me too much. I found it more laughable than sick. Sure, it's a nasty idea...but after the initial reveal of the film's intentions, there was very little more substance or style.

The second film is actually much less of a sequel than it is an expansion on the original idea. It looks and feels nothing like the first. You would never have known it was a sequel if it wasn't for the fact that the whole point of the fim is the first one. It builds on the original idea in an unexpected and fairly clever way, to the point that it's almost a shame this isn't its own piece. It's much better at doing what it set out to do than the first film. Again, not really my cup of tea but for what it's aiming for, it was very well done.

The pacing and tone of the film is...awkward. Unsettlingly so. Where the original progressed very much like a standard film, this had a strange flow. Not in the sense that it was poorly directed, just that the lack of dialogue (seriously, a few lines here and there) and drawn out shots didn't seem to end, but the film actually seemed to fly by (granted, it's only 87 mins long anyway).

Okay, enough.

Alright, so does anyone else know about the theory of Tarantino's meta-fiction?

I really liked the style of the movie, although I felt that the ending was a bit anti-climactic. I don't know, I think that plot-wise it was a well executed finale, but after the gory, stylistic violence of the previous four hours, I kind of expected something more thrilling than the five-finger exploding heart technique.

That was a fantastic movie. For those of you who have not heard of or seen it, it is a character study of Jesse James and his relationship with his murderer. The characters are all so well done, partly due to Brad Pitt, who played James, and Casey Aflec, his murderer, giving some fine performances. However, the direction in this film was fantastic; the emotional manipulation and tension is sharp. I wouldn't hesitate to call this an epic; there are multiple very well done character arcs, there are a large number of characters, and the scope of the whole thing is enough to evade predicability. And last but not least, the biggest achievement I think has to be the cinematography, done by none other than Roger Deakins, who has done most of the Coen Brother's films.

It hasn't been done in a while, so I figured I'd have a go!

Out of all the superheroes, Superman has always been one of my least favorites. Out of the most popular superheroes, the best ones have a really dark back story with a lot of struggle. Spiderman, an angsty teen just trying to grow up, is forced into his life after neglecting to save his uncle. Batman, jaded by the death of his parents and the harsh teachings of the League of Shadows, creates his own brand of justice and seeks to right all the wrongs in his city. However, where's the struggle in Superman? He's a super-human being sent to this planet and he can literally do anything. What's there to relate to there?

Well, Zack Snyder's *Man of Steel* shows that there really is a bit of struggle going on in Superman's head and does its best to make viewers feel for the character.

I always thought the old, Christopher Reeve incarnations were super cheesy. This is a pretty dark retelling of the origin and doesn't have the cheese factor of the old ones.

There's a heavy amount of Kryptonian mythology implemented throughout, which I really enjoyed. Also, the origin aspect of the film is handled pretty well within the first twenty, or so, minutes. They use a lot of flashbacks, intermixed with Clark traveling toward something.

The thirty or forty minute mark is where the action really begins. I never truly felt how powerful Superman really was until this film. The special effects really work in the film's favor.

Michael Shannon definitely dominates in this movie. His General Zod is intimidating and powerful. Yet, his motives are *almost* understandable.

Of course, this movie suffers from plenty of cliches. Why is it in any movie where there's an alien invasion, when the aliens send out a transmission for the whole world to see, they always show people in the western world as watching their modern TVs in their living rooms, while anyone in Asian and Middle eastern countries is in a large group, in some dingy restaurant, crowded around an old, crappy TV? Or worse, in the middle of a desert, in a tent watching TV?

Also, I'm sorry, but Amy Adams was *super* boring in this. She just didn't do it for me, as Lois Lane. Superman can have ANY woman he wants, but chooses Lois. This film could have handled that aspect of the story better. She just always seemed make shitty decisions and forced Superman to constantly save her.

Greetings all! I'm a military service member, and in cooperation with Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, they bid all Service Members a week early free screening of Man of Steel yesterday.


All I can say is, this is one of the best films I've seen as far as ""reboots"" are concerned.


Zack Snider is back in form, with a few JJ Abram-esque shots, he does a fantastic job of directing camera flow, character portrayal, and overall feeling for scenes.


Christopher Nolan has been/is/will continue to be one of my favorite writers. He has weaved a back story for this movie so amazing that you completely understand everything about why Kal-el was sent to earth. In the first film, they never really explain that. Christopher Nolan has weaved a fantastic tale that you feel for every character in the film (save a few exceptions.)


Henry Cavill (unknown to me before now) is completely convincing as the lead. Even the children actors portraying his early life are consistent with his acting in every way. You seriously believe that every younger character has contributed to the way he becomes when he is grown.


Michael Shannon......I've seen many a film with Michael Shannon. Bug and Premium Rush come to mind. In both instances, it felt so overacted. Zod however, is the perfect role for him. He creates a character so engrossing, so..... I can't describe it. He makes Zod come to life in a way that I never would have thought possible.


And a sleeper: Antje Traue. It's been a while since I've seen a truly bad-ass female character. Despite her having plenty of screen time, I still wanted to see more of the action with her in it.


This was one of those movies that you want to do nothing but turn around, and watch it again. I was salivating for the OST walking out of the theater, and plan to buy it on tuesday upon release.


If you see only ONE blockbuster this summer, see Man of Steel. You will find yourself holding your breath during the action, tearing up at the relationships and character interactions, and genuinely worried for the character's lives.

 I sincerely hope there is a sequel somewhere in the future. It's even alluded to in the movie at a particular scene.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1fzlye,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1fzlye/ijw_man_of_steel_2013/,

I especially enjoyed Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach. My largest gripe was in Zack Snyder's directing style which tends to be generally over-the-top style wise (really just an opinion, not really valid criticism I guess).  I'd give it a 7/10.

My question is this:

What did the movie get wrong according the its source material? Were there any large plot points missed out on? What do you think Snyder didn't go in to enough, or perhaps what he went in to too much?

Going into this film, I was aware of several things. One, it was the type of film that people either LOVED or HATED. Second, that I shouldn't be deceived by the title and that it had almost nothing to do with driving and was very very slow and ""artsy"". Three, that it was exceptionally violent. I'm going to be honest, I didn't give a shit about seeing this movie before all the hubbub about how ""dramatic"" and violent it was because I foolishly thought it was just another F&amp;F flick.

God, this movie was amazing. I really really loved pretty much everything about it; the slow shots were mesmerizing, the music was hypnotic and gripping, Gosling was perfect in his role. I didn't know *what* was going to happen from scene to scene. I've always been a fan of mob films and absolutely *love* films like Melancholia (in regards to the pacing and tone), so.. yeah, I don't know, this was just perfect.

I can totally see why some people might not like it--I get it, some want more films like F&amp;F, don't like their ""car"" films to have the slowest pacing in the world (sort of ironic), and feel as if a film with no talking is a film not worth watching. Trust me, I completely understand because I used to be like that. Obviously things have changed for the better(wanting to be a screenwriter and being ridiculed by journalists for passing up ""those films"" will do that to ya) because I'd be missing out on amazing little gems like this one.

What it seems to come down to is that films like this and Sucker Punch are poorly marketed to audiences in order to appeal to what studios think they want to see (even if the film has nothing to do with what's alluded to in the trailer). I, for one, enjoyed Sucker Punch, but that's because going in I knew that it was basically a 90-minute music video and was pleasantly surprised it had dialog. Such a shame though that the bigwigs feel as if they have to trick people into seeing movies because they can't trust the film to just stand on its own feet.

Anyway, loved Drive and recommend it to anyone who loves artsy, slow, and aesthetically pleasing cinema.

I thought the soundtrack was fantastic, as were the visuals. I don't think the dialogue is as cheesy as most said, though I do agree that the plot is a bit goofy.

I was particularly impressed with how the movie itself took on a ""less is more"" approach, which is exactly how men engage with emotional turmoil.

The scene where his friend drops him off for the surgery is a great example.  They never talked about the fight or the book he found.  So much was communicated in that final awkward hug.  There were plenty of other understated but powerful scenes (the father with alzheimer's, his girlfriend remaining in the car, the contrast with the chemo friend's intimacy with his wife).  Yeah, some really good work.

So here is some disclosure.  I saw it with a friend of mine and we're both in med school.  There were a couple of points we both felt strongly about

1) Delivering bad news.  I have NEVER heard of or seen a doctor give someone bad news through dictation.  I can't say it's never happened but if I was on staff with someone who did that, they would be having a stern discussion with me as soon as I heard about it.  It is downright disrespectful.

2) Empathic touches.  This is something we are taught, and it is very common for students to have trouble with it.  Their depiction in the movie is spot on.  Done right, it is an invaluable tool for a physician to express compassion and support.  I hate to be stereotypical but a lot of med students are very good at studying and can be somewhat awkward about social cues so these really can be difficult to perfect.  

3) It is never, *never*, appropriate for a doctor to start a romantic relationship with a patient.  I realize there might be some strict wiggle room in the movie as she is technically a student, but this plot development upset me.  Especially in therapy, patients are emotionally vulnerable and easily manipulated.  It's a major breach in professionalism.

It's not as good as Tarantino's other work, but for his first major release, it's a great movie. It's alittle over 90 mins, but the pacing makes the movie fly by.

Criminals talking about things other than the plot? Check.

Very 2001-esque in parts, especially alone with a robot in space part. That said, Kevin Spacey's Gerty was one of the best parts of the movie, I just loved his little emoticon screen, the part where it started crying just got to me.

That said obviously the stand-out is Sam Rockwell, and because I don't want to give too much away I'll just say that all of his acting is superb, I've only seen in him Seven Psychopaths before this. 

A great original sci-fi with a real emotional punch, and my only reservation is that the ending falls a little flat, I would have preferred a grimmer ending rather than the upbeat one they finished on (well, upbeat to an extent), to fit in better with the general tone of the movie. For example, I would have preferred if [both of the Sams died or were killed by the rescue team and the new clone just woke up and carried on work as normal not knowing what just happened before.](/spoiler)

Just a tiny gripe with what is undoubtedly a great, emotional and though-provoking film that goes down as one of my favourites.

I'm not just jumping on the ol' reddit Dredd bandwagon, I've been meaning to see this for a while and I'm a fan of the comics.

I really enjoyed it, it wasn't the mess the Stallone version was, this really captured the essence of the comics and the brutality of it.

I liked Karl Urban as the titular character, glad he didn't have to take his helmet of, really worked in his favour. 

In the UK this is an 18 certificate, personally I think it should have only been a 15, the violence wasn't that gruesome.

**Twenty minutes in:** This is possibly the most boring film I've ever watched. Eh, I'm sure it'll get better.  

**Thirty minutes in:** Jesus Christ this is, without a doubt, the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen.  

**Thirty minutes, eleven seconds**: holy fucking shit. It looks like E.T., a velociraptor, and a slug had sex then tried to abort the baby.  

**Thirty-two minutes, nineteen seconds:** what.  

**Forty-three minutes:** HOLY FUCKING SHIT ASD;LFIZKN  

**Forty-eight minutes:** what.  

**Forty-nine minutes:** whaat?  

**Fifty-nine minutes:** wait what.  

**Sixty-five minutes:** What.

**Seventy-two minutes:** I would kill that baby right now. That baby obviously comes from the seventh dimension of hell, and you obviously need to kill it right now.

**Seventy-nine minutes:** I DIDN'T MEAN *KILL* IT! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!

So my end conclusion is: that was a weird as hell movie, and I won't mind mulling it over for the next few weeks. It's obviously far above my head, but I don't doubt it's symbolic meanings and connections will blow my mind once I read about and/or think of them. The movie starts off weird as as one of Cthulhu's wet dreams, and only gets weirder from there- which is, I'm pretty sure, a good thing.
Wikipedia sure wasn't fucking around when it said ""surrealist."" And the special effects still hold up remarkably well, even in that ridiculously obvious claymation scene.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!!

Directed by David Fincher, Zodiac brings about memories of his  vastly popular Se7en, although this movie is based on a real serial killer aptly named The Zodiac Killer. There are a rare few directors these days that you can expect greatness from but I'm pleased to write that Fincher is one of them and he delivers here, albeit in a different style than Se7en but just as effective.

Where Se7en felt more about the actual crimes and investigation, Zodiac is fueled by a great cast of characters trying to figure out just who this Zodiac Killer is. From Jake Gyllenhaal's cartoonist and Robert Downey Jr.'s crime reporter to Mark Ruffalo's role as a detective, everyone's performance is top-notch. You're also given a great view into the killer's methods as we see a few of his victims, mostly in the first act. Each victim he picks suffers a different fate but all are equally haunting in their own way, in-your-face murders that leave no room for the imagination. Believe me, you won't need to imagine what it must have felt like for the victims. Watch the film, and you'll feel their horror. 

Captivating and gritty, Zodiac brings you back to the late 60's and early 70's where the killer frightened millions of people in Northern California. It makes you feel like you're there without ever banging you over the head with it. In fact, one of the best visuals of the movie is the very opening when you watch a car cruising through a Vallejo, California neighborhood. That moment alone captures the essence of the time the Zodiac Killer went on his rampage.

By the end of the film you're left wondering just who the killer is, an answer not even the police have discovered to this day. But Fincher allows you every piece of evidence to make up your own mind as to who it may be, even pointing out a very suspicious character as a possibility. Then again, part of what makes the movie and the Zodiac Killer so frightening is that nobody ever caught him. That, in itself, is a chilling fact.",,False,,t5_2rafo,1375668092.0,,,True,t3_1jpid9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1jpid9/ijwzodiac_2007/,

I went into this not knowing it was a prequel to Alien, but it made the payoff at the end a lot more exciting.  I feel that if I watch it again, I'll see a lot more subtle hints that it is related to the events of Alien (or maybe if I watch Alien again!  it's been awhile).  At any rate, I felt like this was an overall great movie, but not shit-your-pants-and-tell-all-your-friends great.  I came to this conclusion because of a few reasons, but mostly because it was hard to follow at times.  

I liked the idea that there were three layers of humanoids in this film:  the ""engineers"", the human crew, and the android David (Michael Fassbender), who reminded me of Roy from Blade Runner.  The film touched on some existential issues but never really resolved any of them, which, of course, is sort of the point.

My two biggest plot gripes are: 1) What motivation did David have for infecting Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) with the evolution juice (or whatever that black shit was)? and 2) Why was it such a big deal that the old man was secretly on the trip with them?  I get that he wants to conquer death...was it supposed to be the hidden agenda behind the entire trip?  Maybe I missed something that would explain these things - perhaps you will tell me in the comments.

There were some moments that were really fantastic, however.  The hyper-evolved mutant worm attack was great, as was the scene where Shaw (Noomi Rapace) performs the operation on herself before she births that horrible octopus-like offspring.  Those two scenes in particular represent what I love about sci-fi.

The characters were interesting, though I never felt any real connection to any of them besides Shaw.  I thought Vickers (Charlize Theron) could have used a little more screen time, she had the potential to be very interesting.  Apparently the writers thought differently, as they gave her the least creative death possible.  I wanted to scream ""RUN DIAGONALLY AWAY FROM THAT THING, YOU BITCH"" at the screen, but I am a decent human being so I did not.

All in all, this was a somewhat disoriented yet visually stunning film, and I believe it actually benefited from being in 3D (unlike so many others).

Aronofsky is a great director, and I'm a huge fan of his stuff, so this was a fun adventure for it being my first-time viewing.

Basically it's the story about a mathematician who's on a quest to uncover the secret behind a series of numbers that he happens across one day. His discovery puts him in the crosshairs of a Wall Street firm bent on economical domination and Jewish elders bent on religious purification. This is me gisting the Hell out of it, so feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken - also, the plot and it's multiple nuances run much deeper than JUST a series of numbers, but going into further detail might ruin the experience.

Sean Gullette is fantastic in this! He makes a very believable paranoid, with ceaseless migraines. Everything he does, says, and even the apartment he lives in, emanates his personality and helps you feel a connection that oftentimes fail in a lot of other great movies.

Even though the film is in B&amp;W - which some people may have an issue with - you come to realize that it was definitely an aesthetic that makes the film stronger, rather than just some random expression of Aronofsky's artistic side.

Starring: Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley

Story: In the year 2154, the earth has become so populated, polluted and the people diseased that the earths most wealthy 1% has fled the planet and now lives in luxury on a space station called Elysium. A excon finds himself in need of a resource only Elysium has and does everything he can to reach the Space station.

Review: I am a fan of Neill Blomkamp's first film District 9 so I was looking forward to seeing how he handled his second film. The story is well written and in my opinion very original. I haven't heard of or seen anything like this movie and so that was a real delight. The premise was well thought out and this reflected in the film.

The highlight of the film is that it is a social and political commentary on how our world is now and what it could be in the future, making this dystopia seem all too possible. It uses growing trends in society as devices to make this plot seem plausible and give the story more color. Such social trends being the rise of Spanish as the dominant language, the growing population, excelled technology and access to knowledge of technology, and last but not least the overwhelmed medical field.

These nuances coupled with the plot line that makes you wonder if Matt Damon's character, Max De La Costa, can pull off this great feat leave the audience gripped.(being vague on purpose)

I have to say I felt a lackluster performance from Matt however. The scenes where he's suppose to seem emotional or complicated make him seem cold and doesn't allow the audience to attach ourselves to him nor root for him and his love interest. Also Jodie Foster's character was well done but there was small hiccup to her performance. I don't know if the sound was off at the theater (I don't think it was because other characters sounded fine) but Jodie Foster's sentences sounded and looked like they were badly dubbed over in the editing room. I don't know if this was because she has a different accent in real life and that wouldn't go well with the uppity persona she was giving or what happened but her lips didn't move in sync with her words.

On the other hand Sharlto Copley, the lead role from District 9, played out the crazed maniac role so over the top I began to loathe him. This is exactly how acting should be done. We should forget your name is Sharlto Copley and your in movies but rather think you are Kruger and I hate you! 5 stars to this guy.

The action sequences were spot on in some places where they had more room to film but in others the shots were too close and you just saw blurred arms and legs. There was a few great almost slow-mo shots where you felt like you were there in the action with the characters. There was one in particular where I believe they had strapped the camera to the back of Matt Damon giving us a great over the shoulder shot of the action. I wouldn't have been mad if they filmed part of it like that. Cinematography and cgi was well used in this. They had props where they needed them and cgi where they needed it. It wasn't all Cgi'ed like you see in a lot of films. I keep wondering if they used models at all for the space portions but I couldn't tell from my viewing.

I give the overall movie a 7 for effort and originality but it lacked in acting, editing(sound) and the ending felt very Hollywood cliche to me.

I finally watched it, I had been putting it off.  I think Robin Williams was great, hence the Oscar he won.  While somewhat predictable, what made the movie so impressive was the heartfelt performances from all of the cast.  Putting aside the unlikely situation Matt Damon's character represents, he made his predicament believable and heartfelt.
I don't know why this bothered me, but the soundtrack in the first half of the film did not seem to fit.  [I forgot about that as the movie approached its climax and the coming character change of Will, when he started to embrace Williams' character as a more fatherly figure.  Of course at the end he goes for the girl in California, who seemed to also set him free from identity struggle.](/spoiler)  Again, I was impressed by Robin's subtle performance of a grieving psychologist intrigued by a one in a billion boy.

So, I had been massively excited about this one last year, and I finally got to see it this week.

What a mammoth let-down.

Let's start with the good:

* Michael Fassbender was brilliant, clearly the best thing in it. His portrayal of the android was quirky, cold, graceful, charming and terrifying all in one. A deeply unnerving character, with shades of grey, depth, complexity - everything I hoped for.

* It looked beautiful. From set design, to photography, it was stunning to look at.

* Noomi Rapace was decent, Idris Elba I will watch in anything, and Charlize Theron was good but underused.

* Some of the body-horror moments were excellent, there were a couple of really nice set-pieces (especially the medical pod).


The bad:

* Nigh on everything else. I hate to nitpick a film but the story was so horribly broken that I found it hard to pay attention to the events on screen. Right from the first briefing I was annoyed at little things (hey, you all signed up for a hugely expensive, 2-year trip to deep space - now lets explain why!), but the overall plot was bollocks too. When you produce a film in the Alien universe and manage to have a more broken and nonsensical story than AvP, god help you. 

* The science was abysmal (the DNA matches!).

* The character actions were totally illogical and inconsistent. This is possibly explained by everyone apart from those I've already mentioned being forgettable and interchangeable pretty much. I guess the writers forgot who was who and just made them do whatever they wanted at whatever point to advance the events in the order they saw fit. At all times, it felt like things happened because that was the way the script was written, and not because that was the way they genuinely would happen. It felt like a first draft, with the big set-pieces in place, but the connective tissue just roughly sketched in until someone came along and fleshed it out with logical connections and motivations - except that never happened. 

* The engineer was no way near big enough, compared to the mummified corpse in Alien.

* The fan-service monster at the very end was pretty rubbish-looking.

I like to think that there is a director's cut out there that's actually good, but I'm afraid that the problems are structural, and cannot be saved in edit.

Generally speaking, I am more of a reader than a watcher; I am far more likely to have read the book than seen the film.  However, this weekend, I am sick, and when you're sick, you need to watch a film, ideally one that you can deduce the entire plot from the IMDB summary/back of the DVD box/trailer.

There were absolutely no surprises, and it was glorious.

Action comedy is a much more difficult genre to get properly right than it may seem, and this film was one of the actioniest, comediest action comedies I think I've ever seen, with the perfect mix of both.  Films that make fun of the film industry can also seem a bit self-indulgent if not done well, and this one didn't fall into that trap either; the whole film was worth it just for the parody trailers at the beginning.  There was a nice mix of intelligent and immature humour, and not too much of either.  While not a film I'm going to be mulling over for any length of time after, it made for a wonderfully entertaining couple of hours, which was exactly what I was after.

**Going in I**

-didn't know what to expect (didn't see any trailers) but DAMN it was good

-had heard J. Black gave a career defining performance and now wholeheartedly agree. Props.


**This movie would appeal to people who enjoy**

-comedians taking on more serious roles 

-fake mockumentary style movies (think District 9)

-quirky small-town settings (this one's set in Texas)

-movies adapted from true real life events

**(Spoilers below)**


**Loved how**

-the leadup to, the events after, and the murder itself were handled. The entire plot progressed so smoothly. It had me second-guessing what might happen the entire way, even though the actual outcome in hindsight was fairly obvious. 

-it gets you to sympathize/root for Bernie and against the DA/justice system, thus causing you to evaluate your own morality and question the meaning of justice and forgiveness aka IT MAKES YOU THINK

-it portrays Southern folk in a positive yet fair and realistic light

-they used the actual townspeople who knew the real Bernie

-awesome the end credits were, would like more movies to do this

Then some of the reviews I was hearing were a bit mixed, so I didn't rush to pick it up on Bluray. Finally caught it on Netflix and it really is a mixed bag.

About half of Super 8 is stunning - a well-acted, well-paced, well-written love-letter to Spielbergian 80's classics like ET. As a non-american, just like those films it managed to fill me with nostalgia for a childhood that is totally unfamilar to me, a childhood I've only experienced through cinema - enormous houses, open-plan kitchen diners, mod-cons, broad sweeping suburban roads, golden summers and late night CB conversations with neighbourhood kids...  The two child actors in the leads were thoroughly excellent, especially Elle Fanning, who acted ""acting"" fantastically well.

Then, there's the other half of the film, the escaped alien. Boring, cliched, badly written, badly paced, mostly lacking in tension and at times incoherent. Ultimately, the children play no part in events, which basically would have unfolded the same without them. I think films like this should either focus on the human drama with larger events serving as a backdrop, or make the human actions actually matter to proceedings. Had the alien stuff been merely hinted at, and the focus remained much more on the children, this could have been an excellent film. Had the children had a closer relationship with the alien and been somehow involved in repairing its ship it could have been an excellent film. As it is, it seemed pointless, with the alien as an excuse to blow shit up and little else. It was like they decided that's what the film would be about, without actually thinking what the film was going to be *about*.

So, the first half, brilliant. However, the second half grows steadily worse until it ends quite suddenly, finally leaving you with the sense of a mediocre film and a lost opportunity to make something worthwhile.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_ywmrs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/ywmrs/ijw_super_8_spoilers/,

This movie is fan-fucking-tastic. It is *Mary Poppins* meets *Fight Club*.

The plots is like if you were a scrawny nerd in middle school and one of the scary, high school metal-heads, who smokes cigarettes across the street from school, decided he was going to move into your house. And, all the while, your parents ignored him and allowed him to torment you.

I watched this based solely on my history teacher's recommendation. She said that it disturbed her and made her sick to her stomach. Being a David Fincher fan, I immediately put it on the To Watch list.

Sam Mendes directs. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winselt are the Wheelers, stereotypical family in 1950s America with high hopes and big dreams to be different. Kathy Bates is a family friend, her role is minor. Michael Shannon is the son of Bates' character, who is considered ""insane"" and brings real truth into the Wheeler household the few times he appears.

The disturbance does not stem from gore or rape, only the mentality and the lifestyle of the 1950s household. Ticky tacky houses, everyone the same and no deviance from the social norm or there will be consequences.
It was beautifully shot, fantastic acting, perfect writing. The soundtrack was unsettling, it put a lot into the film. I highly recommend this film, as I indeed felt a little sick after it all came to a close.

*Mind you the purpose of the film is not horror or thriller, simply a drama made to make people think. It's easy to look back at those standards and judge, but the same things happen nowadays. Do not watch this expecting, say, Funny Games.*

At the same time it's beautiful, it may be predictable, but it executes so well you can't help but choke up at the end.

Obviously Ewan McGregor does not have the greatest Alabama southern accent that is achievable, this does not ruin my immersion however. There are some great themes. You know generic ones, boy becomes a man. Blah blah. But sometimes, a viewer just needs to sit back and allow them self to be taken along for a ride so enjoyable.

I just wanted to give you a bit of a reminder further to the other recent mod post on this topic. Reviews not actually containing a review ***will*** be deleted by the mods, regardless of whether or not a discussion has begun off the back of a non-review. 

If a film was so rubbish that you wouldn’t recommend others watch it, at least take the time to go into some detail about why you find it so unappealing and let others discuss it with you and decide for themselves. If all you have to say is ‘it was rubbish,’ please don’t post.

We’re not looking for film critic reviews here, so don’t feel as though you’re being judged like one. We’re looking for interaction. We want people to become interested (or the reverse) in watching films by having meaningful discussions about them. To argue about plot lines, talk about sequels, discuss how one actor always excels and so forth.

IJW: Withnail and I (1987)
(Text post)
(IMDB link)
Two struggling actors who are surviving on benefits live together in a grim council flat in London in the 1960s. They never seem to get any work and yet there’s always money for booze. When the booze runs out, they resort to any substitute they can, including lighter fluid. The central character, Withnail, becomes so depressed about this state of affairs that one day that he decides to ask his uncle Monty if they can borrow his cottage in the UK countryside to get away for a holiday for a while. Monty happily agrees, and they totter off on holiday but with consequences neither of them could have possibly anticipated. 

I liked this film, it has a lot of humour, even if I don’t exactly understand it all (would anyone British care to help me out to understand some of the 'funnies' more?).  IMDB rate it 7.7, I rate it 6.5.

Two struggling actors who are surviving on benefits live together in a grim council flat in London in the 1960s. The flat is disgusting: there’s weeks of washing up piled in the sink, to the extent that they think there’s something alive in the sink. Despite their financial anxieties they always seem to have money for booze and drugs. The local drug dealer, Danny, along with a guy with a GINORMOUS joint (named the ‘Camden carrot’) have a couple of entertaining scenes. 

When the booze runs out it’s not beyond them to resort to anything in the flat and they argue about who drank the last of whatever contains alcohol… metholated spirits, lighter fluid: there is NO low.  

Withnail gets fed up with the monotony and asks his thespian uncle Monty if they can borrow his cottage in the British countryside to get away for a holiday (for just long enough for them to get back in time to claim their next dole money).  Antics and hilarity occur…

So after a drunken journey they arrive to a ramshackle cottage with no heat, no food and barely a stable roof to hold it together. It’s pouring down with rain and Withnail is hung-over and miserable. He has to resort to burning his boots in the cast-iron oven for heat. 
Uncle Monty takes a liking to ‘I’, a character whose name is never revealed, and secretly follows them to the countryside so that he can get closer to ‘I.’
The locals display extreme hostility when asked if they can purchase food from them. However, they manage to get in with the local pub owner by lying about a fictitious military career. 

What do others think of the humour of this film? What’s your favourite line? It’s amazing to think that such a small budget (now ‘cult’) film launched Richard E Grant’s career so rapidly.  Do you think Monty would’ve had a different reaction to ‘I’ if he’d attended a ‘common’ university?! IMDB rate it 7.7, I rate it 6.5 – perhaps I’d rate it higher if I really understood the humour more.

**The Italian shoes.** It may have been a mind game knowingly played by Nixon, but he seemed a bit obsessed with them. Multiple comments on a man's shoes is kind of bizarre, especially for someone who seemed to pride himself on his intellectual depth. I saw them as a symbol of being dominated, or at least I saw it as Nixon seeing them as such. I think it was a statement on how Nixon was an out-of-date traditionalist, someone who would rather defeat other people's notions of what was right rather than accept any kind of introspection or personal progress to line up with those notions. Frost, on the other hand, didn't have to put nearly as much effort into not being an asshole. It reminded me of the House Atreides/House Harkonnen dichotomy in Dune: the former attracted followers by being likable and also firm, but the other demanded submission or they'd have you killed. I'm still sussing out my thoughts on the shoes, but the adversarial tone of the film combined with Nixon calling them effeminate and then getting a pair of them from the man who beat him, they have to mean something about domination there.

**The fighting metaphor.** Nixon describes the interview as ""no-holds-barred"" and ""a duel."" The title of the film even looks like a fight card from a boxing match. In the late-night raving phone call (that apparently never actually happened, at least not with David Frost), Nixon repeats how he wants to ""choke"" the snobs that made him feel inadequate about his upbringing. Nixon was winning rounds on the scorecard, but in the late rounds Frost hit him with the knockout punch by getting him to say the famous ""If the president does it it's not illegal"" line and won the bout. He didn't admit much at all and barely admitted any culpability, but it was enough of a blow that it's all people really remember. They don't think of the droning about Khruschev and Mao, they remember him saying the President can do what he wants as long as it's ""in the interest of national security,"" and I use those scare quotes very deliberately here.

**Frank Langella's absolutely spot-on performance.** In his review of the new Star Trek movie, Mark Kermode mentioned that the actors did the perfect amount of impersonation of the characters of the old show. Zachary Quinto wasn't trying to be Leonard Nimoy, he was trying to be Spock. I never confused Langella with Nixon, but that's a *good* thing. If you want technical skill at impressions, watch Game Change, but as Sam Rockwell's character mentions, visual media like film and TV have the power of distillation, and Langella took full advantage of that. He played Nixon as a dominating and subtly cruel man, but in spite of all that and how he betrayed the trust of the American people, when he talks about how he let us and our system of government down, I really did feel for him. He seemed genuinely contrite, but he still couldn't admit that he did it willfully, throwing that trust in the toilet so he could be a petty tyrant to his enemies. 

Still, Nixon was a smart man, and had a good deal of insight into other people; I have to believe that on some level he saw that his moral culpability extended beyond ""oops."" His line about how his actions have probably left a deep impression on the youth regarding government struck a chord; the idea that politics is hopelessly corrupt has probably kept reformers out, which has let the corruption fester. Because of that knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days in a personal hell of self-loathing, and even worse, he knew he would and knew it was his own fault. Even worse than that is that his ego wouldn't let him air out that fault. I know failure, but I don't know failure on that grand a scale. It has to really, really hurt, and in spite of my dislike of Nixon the president, I felt pretty bad for Nixon the man. All that internal conflict takes a lot of chops to convey, and Langella did an amazing job.

If you haven't seen this for whatever reason and aren't turned off by talk-y movies, I can't recommend it highly enough.

**This post contains spoilers** (not like the cars, silly)

I am aware that I am kind of late to the party considering most of reddit recommends or has seen this movie. I was shocked on how entertaining and thought provoking the movie was I was shocked seeing it for the first time with no knowledge of the plot or premise. I had to re-watch several scenes just to make sure some of the instances were correct. For example, James always sees or hears something from his child hood and is repeated every time he goes back in time, proving time travel. The biggest mind-fuck of this movie is knowing that James witnesses himself dying and has no idea that is is him. However, the part that hit me right in the gut was that the psychiatrist noticed and knew James' younger self immediately and looked at him in the way that she feels sorry for him and that everything will be ok. But its not. That was so important for this movie because it brings up so many ironic situations. The couple was on their way to a relationship that lasted beyond their knowledge of when each other existed, but it all tumbles down in seconds. I found that it was ironic that even though time travel was possible, even going back in time in a matter of seconds to events, like Jose (James cellmate), there still was not enough time to stop the assistant scientist. I was equally intrigued of how ironic the situation on the plane led the same future scientist, who met the assistant in person, want to solve the mystery of how the virus spread throughout the world in the first place.


The critical error that the future makes is how unpredictable one person can be when they themselves don't have any motive before certain events take shape. In this scenario, the assistant gets the idea from the lead scientist, who's crazy son gave him the idea of breaking in and stealing the virus. The crazy son got that idea from James, who joked about his life in the future about a deadly virus. So technically, ether James killed the population by accident, or that the assistant saw an opportunity to do evil and took it.


So from all this gibber-jabber of my thoughts and connections I found, I was very happy I saw this movie. I believe that this movie deserves an 8/10 because it could have been a little better. I would believe that Jose travels back to the future to inform the scientists that James failed, but only because the future scientist failed to notice who she was sitting next to on the plane. Or, if it can't be answerable, who was talking to James in his mind. If the time travel machine was messed up, how or why did it fluctuate to WW1 before 1996. Those are small nitpicks, but I believe that the best scenario would be the future scientist personally knowing that she met the most dangerous man in the world and fucked it up.

Memento is the third, and in my opinion, best film by Christopher Nolan. It's story is one of the most original and creative stories I have ever seen. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man who can't create new memories. So he uses a series of notes and tattoos to help him find out who killed his wife. The film's structure is split up into two parts. The colored portions of the movie actually proceed backwards, while the black &amp; white proceed in chronological order. This mean these sequences proceed at the end, and beginning, of the story and meet at the middle. Alright, enough with the plot summary. I loved this movie. It was one of the most rewarding film experiences I've ever had because it's extremely rewarding to find where the connective tissue lies between the events. Not that that's the only thing that's good about the film. The dialogue is great, and the performances by Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss are fantastic. The ending is mind blowing. SPOLIERS: Leonard helps kill a man who's named John G., the name which belongs to the man who killed his wife. It turns out that it isn't the John G. he wanted, because he killed John G.  over a year ago. He also lied to himself, because Sammy Jankis, the only man Leonard's ever met with his condition, was never married and it was his wife who was diabetic, not Sammy's. Leonard forgot about the killing of the right John G., so he started hunting again. Joe Pantoliano's character John Gammel has been helping Leonard to keep hunting for different John G's. So, before he forgets, Leonard writes down, ""Don't believe his lies,"" on John's picture. And so the hunt begins again. SPOILERS ENDED. 

Memento is a tightly structured and plotted story that has themes about revenge and betrayal. It is a fantastic movie that is a modern classic. Christopher Nolan has done it again!

Possible Spoilers Ahead, HAL!

Man, this was a great movie! I can't believe I stayed away from this for so long! After being slightly disappointed by Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, I was afraid to watch this movie. I say that because I thought Blade Runner was sometimes slow and uneventful, a common criticism of 2001 . But it was worth it! This movie has the most beautiful imagery ever! The special effects are awesome, and still hold up to this day. The story is also great, with some mind boggling themes about technology and evolution. This is a film that you can sit down and just watch. It is so thought provoking and crazy! HAL is a great character, and his departure made me a little sad. I only have one or two criticisms about the film. WARNING: STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING SPOILED. My first is the switch of main characters. In the first act of the film, our main character is Dr. Heywood Floyd, who helps discover the monolith on the moon. But in the second and third acts, our main character switches to Dave Bowman. There is no mention of Dr. Floyd, who played a big part in setting up the events for the Jupiter mission. It almost feels like two different movies. Also, what was with the room? I understood that Bowman traveled through vast amounts of space, but he suddenly gets transported to a random room, where he dies and becomes the Star-Baby. What's up with that! But, all in all, everyone should see this movie. It's a masterpiece and a true classic!

Extremley suprised with this film, as I went in expecting much of the same as I saw in X-Men Origins, a few years ago.
Safe to say, this film is far superior.
This is Hugh Jackman's best outing as Wolverine, and he is joined by (for the most part) a very talented cast of supporting actors. I completely recommend this film, and don't forget to stay after the credits, for a teaser that will blow your mind!

&gt;I should warn everyone that there may be some spoilers in &gt;this review.

The movie was great, and for some reason reminded me a bit of Fargo, but the story felt a little bit messy. 

I'm a huge fan of unconventional storytelling. This movie had that, but it somehow made a relatively simple plot feel complex and hard to follow. 

The main problem was with the characters.

 Many of them (Dick Liddil, Ed Miller ,and Wood Hite mainly) just felt like little characters I didn't need to pay attention to... but then they later come back into the story.

 It made me feel like I missed something. 

The other problem was with Jesse James. The progression from ""good to bad"" in this film was very sudden, and I don't think that was on purpose. 

Now once I did look past these problems, figure out the movie, and just go with the flow, I really really enjoyed it. 

The cinematography was great. (as always expected by Deakins) 

The soundtrack is one of my favorites. 

I'm not a huge fan of music playing a large role in movies... I feel like scenes should speak for themselves, but this movie utilized the soundtrack VERY well. 

There are many scenes of this movie that had my heart pounding. The use of the powerful music, along with the camerawork and acting really made the scenes in this movie (mostly the assassination) incredible. 

I almost forgot about Robert Ford. 

The character of Robert is incredible. Casey Affleck's acting was perfect in his role, and I really sympathized/ cared for him. 

I wish I could say more about his character, but it's honestly hard to put it in words. 

It was probably one of my favorite characters. 

I didn't really like the first quarter of this movie. It felt slow, and was just hard to get used to, but once I got over that I really enjoyed it. 

It's the kind of movie that doesn't really feel like something amazing while I'm watching it, but once it's over, I almost miss it. ",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1jha4n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1jha4n/ijw_the_assassination_of_jesse_james_by_the/,

What I believe makes a good film is a plot which drives the human journey in which the audience ultimately connects with and relates with. I think that is where M. Night’s Unbreakable film succeeds the most. Each character undergoes an arch which is set off by the comic book themes of superpowers and good vs evil. This is especially impactful because it is shown through the microcosm of David’s family and their interactions with Elijah Price. The train crash, the super powers, and the twist at the end ultimately take a backseat to the human elements. As the characters in this film undergo self-realizations, there is a prevalent theme of awakening lost or dormant truths within. Everyone is trying to make sense of what is happening around them, but moreover it is a desire to assume destined roles which are unknown or uncertain to them. Elijah wants to know his existence on this earth, as fragile as it is, serves a higher purpose. David feels sadness in his day to day causing him to be passive and quiet, in many scenes with his wife Audrey, she will say dialogue that normally would illicit action or emotion but David does little and says nothing. Something holds him back from being a good husband or a strong father figure. David’s son Joseph struggles with the possibility of his father moving to New York, he wants more than anything to connect with his father. With the train accident as the catalyst, Elijah becomes the super villain, David stops being so emo and becomes more of the football Alpha male he originally was. Audrey subsequently gets her “football star"" the person she originally fell for. Joseph not only gets his family life repaired but also finds out his dad is a superhero. How cool is that.

I especially like Josephs relationship arch. Finding out his father is essentially superman, really captures that sense of youth wonder and amazement that is tied to reading comic books. I imagine, aside from being a superhero yourself, probably a child’s second best discovery would be finding out your dad was one. I will admit this element in the movie strikes a special place in my own heart because I look up to my own father very much. The scene where Joseph “helps"" David lift weights always makes me smile and at the end, when David slides Joseph the newspaper clipping -always puts the feelings inside of me… ;D

This film is certainly not without its flaws. One being, in a minimalistic film like this one where you get Bruce Willis “stripped down to the bare essentials"", what seemingly is left is ultimately not very much. BW is pretty much a one note actor in general and he lucked out in this film as his typical play it cool face was passable in this plot but a better actor would have had more substance in many of the scenes where complex emotions needed to have been shown where there was very little dialogue (ie pretty much every scene Bruce Willis is in, especially ones with just him and his wife Audrey). Some other of the film’s weaknesses and I am being nitpicky now, is the film’s score being really ill-fitting at times, the opening titles especially sounds like it should be played while shopping at a high-end euro boutique -which completely drew me out of what could have been a particularly interesting opening scene where we see Elijah being just born with broken arms and legs. Also, something I personally loathe is unnecessary text in the beginning tossing out comic book statistics (wtf?) and at the very end explaining that Elijah is in the looney bin at the end. That makes me especially livid, and what I think is what is really wrong with the film industry (a rant for a latter date) -what a missed opportunity! I’d much rather have been left wondering, what happened to Elijah, and go home imagining continued adventures in where Elijah, now aware that superheroes exist, attempts to use his terrorism tactics to find more heroes while David tries to stop him.

All in all, this fantastic film is simply a realistic, minimalistic meditation on the superhero genre. This is different from oh lets say another amazing superhero movie like Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, where it is much more heavy-handed, those movies are cool because they are a culmination of cool things shown to us. It is a buffet of visual awesomeness, where Bruce Wayne fights ninjas, flies around as Batman, uses gadgets and beats up the Joker. Those are awesome scenes shown realistically. This film is amazing because it is less about seeing super heroic things on screen and more about thinking of the real world repercussions of such ideas. How the hell did M. Night make this...

Hard Candy is probably the most underrated movie of its kind, and that's not saying something because Hard Candy is such a unique idea. It's not every day you see a movie about a 14-year-old vigilante who turns a predator's familiar game of cat-and-mouse against him. Ellen Page plays Hayley Stark, and she is completely convincing, first as the seemingly unaware victim, then as the hunter, which impressed me, as she had just finished her junior year in high school. Patrick Wilson plays Jeff Kohlver, the predator, very well. Although his character does not develop quite as much as Page's, his character definitely goes through a lot, and he definitely does change. Both Page and Wilson did an incredible job.

The story-telling in Hard Candy is very good. With only two major roles, it would be understandable or even expected for the movie to get dry. However, a combination of skillful directing by David Slade, great camera work complete with tastefully done rough cuts, superb work by digital colorist Jean-Clement Sorter, and of course the two stars' amazing acting keep both the tension and the viewer's interest alive.

What left the biggest impression on me, however, was how ambiguous the movie is. It is possible to interpret the movie differently than your friend, and both views would be just as solid as the other. Many people become outraged at Hayley, and they find it hard not to sympathize with Jeff. To them, the movie becomes the story of an angry, disturbed teenager who attacks anyone she thinks deserves it, and to them, Hayley becomes a sociopath. Others cheer Hayley and her conquest. She becomes not a sick, twisted human, but an intelligent and passionate person, a heroine, a symbol. As she says, ""I am every little girl you ever watched, touched, hurt, screwed, killed."" Who is the greater evil? Perhaps neither is entirely good or entirely bad. The movie presents the question, but we supply the answer.

Equally adept at being a disturbing mockumentary and a side-splitting comedy, Man Bites Dog is notorious for its controversial depiction of brutal violence in a manner that walks the line between terrifyingly realistic and amusingly grotesque perfectly. Its polarizing reception, ranging from utter disdain to worship, is part of what makes this unusual little film so fascinating, and considering its shoestring budget it's quite impressive. When something successfully makes you laugh over and over again about the most appalling violence, whilst simultaneously making you feel slightly uneasy about it, it has to be doing something very right. The grimness of the b/w photography and the surprisingly natural acting gives it an air of realism that is generally absent in other mockumentaries.

Due to the intelligent, subtle humor in the script and the charming, witty lead in the form of Benoit Poelvoorde, whose line delivery is spot-on, the film does the impossible of making you root with one of the most vile characters ever on screen. Even though a very small part of me thought how wrong and morally bankrupt the content it is, I couldn't help but grin uncontrollably when watching Ben do his job. He's sadistic, cruel, and repugnant, and yet so entertaining and charismatic. It's lines such as “Usually I start the month with a postman” matched with a blunt murder scene that make the film such a memorable and hilarious experience. Man Bites Dog provides the darkest of dark humor and strong undertones of social commentary, all wrapped up in a visually intense package. Definitely deserving of its status.

For a long time *Lady in the Water* was my favorite Shyamalan movie, although everyone hates it. But when I sat down to watch *Unbreakable* I changed my mind. This movie is about a security guard played by Bruce Willis who, with the help of a comic book enthusiast played by Samuel L. Jackson, begins to realize that he is a superhero. 

What I really like about this movie is how subtle it is. It's not the typical origin story where the hero realizes his power, becomes a hero, a villain appears, and they have a face-off at the end. This film is paced well, showing Willis' slow progression and development eventually ending with him accepting who he is. Nothing was over the top and it felt quite realistic with Willis going through troubles with his wife and son. 

There were also a few intense scenes that I enjoyed. My only real gripe was that the ending comes immediately after the twist (which was awesome, by the way) and felt tacked on. I think it could have been fleshed out more instead of just being explained with text on the screen.

The actors did great, especially Samuel L. Jackson playing an obsessed comic collector. When he was on screen, I was enamored with what he had to say. He is definitely one of my favorite characters.

1369831757.0,21,self.Ijustwatched,1f9k3d,IJW: The Iron Giant (1999),fabsx,22,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1f9k3d/ijw_the_iron_giant_1999/,"[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/)

The Iron Giant is a film I've neglected for far too long and having now seen it I wish I went to see it back when seeing the TV ads for its cinematic release. Not only is it staggeringly beautiful in its animation, flawlessly blending cel animation, the gorgeously painted backgrounds, and the computer-generated Iron Giant, it is a deeply moving story of compassion and friendship that is guaranteed to break both kids and adults. At the center of the film is the smart but dorky Hogarth Hughes, roughly 10 years old and without father or friends. He seeks refuge in cheesy Horror and Sci-Fi flicks he catches on TV and the plethora of comic books he owns. Although this fixes his loneliness temporarily it is clear from his behaviour that he is in desperate need of a real, unconditional friendship.

Here is where the Iron Giant comes into play and although his size and appetite for anything metal are intimidating at first he is calm and sensitive in nature. His child-like manners juxtaposed with his incredible, otherworldly appearance work like a charm and make him one of the most endearing, heartwarming characters ever created. The bond that quickly develops between Hogarth and the Giant is so strong and palpable it makes the experience of watching the film utterly enchanting, magical and moving to the point of goosebumps. Their friendship is so beautifully captured and developed within such a relatively small time-frame, it is a wonder the film even works let alone resonates so strongly.

Not a moment is wasted, be it the charming comedic antics of the duo or their mutual teaching of the true value of friendship, loyalty and love, every single frame is precious and done with care. Bird proved himself to not only be a fantastic animator but also a true storyteller and one of the medium's finest. The Iron Giant has a heart bigger than its titular character. Its powerful climax and inspiring message of compassion will move, shake and eventually break anyone willing to really let the film breathe in all its sensuous wonder. Escapism at its finest and an essential for kids, parents and anyone ever. There are a series of lines spoken by Hogarth and the Giant towards the end that are so simple and natural they could only come from people passionate about wanting to tell a story and do it with grace. Bird and everyone involved in this masterpiece poured their hearts into it and created a film so rich and illuminating it is absolutely shameful to think how poorly it did on release and how relatively forgotten it is by now.

The Iron Giant is gorgeous on its surface and absolutely awe-inspiring on the inside. The combined force of the writing, direction, voice acting and the wonderful soundtrack hit me in a vulnerable spot. In a time ridden with cynical and ugly cash-ins masquerading as children's animation it is a blessing to know films of this caliber can still be made and appeal to both kids and adults without coming off as condescending. So beautiful.

Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear.

It started quite well, nice over-the-top pre-credits action, nice title sequence (despite the dirge of a theme song). The setup felt vaguely familiar (list of operatives missing? Quick, call Tom Cruise!) and they blew up MI6 again, so it was all a bit old hat Bond coming back from the dead was accomplished and over with fine, but it didn't really seem to matter in any way. 

One of the overall themes was about the old vs the new, and whether Bond was past it - but he'd been absolutely on top of his game just 3 months earlier, so the real question was was he too much of an alcoholic substance abuser to function, not whether he was too old. But they gave him a bit of a haggardy beard to hammer the point home, so whatever.

Bond flies around the world a bit, has him some sex, kills some dudes. Then we meet the bad guy and it starts to unravel.

Its not that I don't like Javier Bardem. Its just that it devolves into talking about nothing. The script goes nowhere. Most of the talk in the film is just filling space it seems, but from about this point on it became impossible to ignore.

So, Bardem's ""plan"" is to get himself implausibly captured and taken to MI6's underground base, and part of his plan was to *force* MI6 into that base in the first place, and then escape, and then use the tube and a policeman's uniform to escape, and then crash a tube train, and then walk into a hearing that he couldn't have possibly forseen and shoot Judie Dench. The whole thing makes no frigging sense. I don't mind suspending disbelief (especially with the hilarious movie-logic computer stuff), but this was just stupid. The whole story hinges on a sequence of events that is never explained or justified or rationalised - they're just left to stand on their own, and like that the flaws are just blindingly obvious.

By the time they wheel out the Aston and the old Bond theme, it feels really forced and insulting as it was so unearned a homage.

We get a nice A-Team bit towards the end, and some pretty Scottish scenery, but it was all a bit boring.

On the whole the performances were great - but the words they were saying were random, meaningless and empty, and there was no actual plot. Dench dies in the end, which is what Bardem wanted all along, and no-one mentions the still-missing disk of MI6 operatives.

&gt;""Peter Weir's film makes much noise about poetry, and there are brief quotations from Tennyson, Herrick, Whitman and even Vachel Lindsay, as well as a brave excursion into prose that takes us as far as Thoreau's Walden. None of these writers are studied, however, in a spirit that would lend respect to their language; they're simply plundered for slogans to exort the students toward more personal freedom. At the end of a great teacher's course in poetry, the students would love poetry; at the end of this teacher's semester, all they really love is the teacher.""
&gt;

Aside from Ebert being a complete party pooper, I think he fails in observing some key facts about the movie. That John Keating, their teacher, is to use a metaphor, literally their captain in navigating their life, and the boys are his stewards. Yes the movie is a hallmark-card type of sweetness but I think the real reason that Ebert is quite negative about the movie is the fact that he considers himself a true ""bohemian"" / counter-culture, and that this Bohemian-Lite with kid-gloves on seems to just feel like a bad pandering. I think he resents the idea that suburban, rich, privileged kids can experience real defiance in the purest form of the idea, and to shake off the things that don't matter, and instead, seize the day. Everyone knows that these kids aren't really defying ""anything""; that is to say, they aren't creating a movement that is observed on a national scale, they aren't actively effecting any change in society, they aren't performing a ""legitamate"" art movement. And I think that this is what [Ebert's review](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890609/REVIEWS/906090301/1023) focuses on.

This movie was a complete failure.  I had looked forward to it since first seeing the trailer.  I found the plot interesting as well as the concept of seeing genres from all throughout cinema history being played out by 25 year olds.  For example, Cillian Murphy's character was a detective who was apprximately 100 years old.  I was excited to see a 25 year old character in a futuristic setting being the classic, film noir style detective, and so on.  


In fact, Cillian Murphy had the only worthwhile performance in this film, and even he did not portray what I had hoped for.  Justin Timberlake's acting was abysmal, as was the performances of the entire supportign cast.  The writing was one of the most lazy scripts I had experienced in quite some time.  I couldn't have counted the cliches on all of my fingers and toes.  They reused every typical example in the book, for example running towards eachother with the clock ticking down only to not make it at the last second(who would'a thought!).


There was little to no character development, for anyone.  JT's character, who worked in a factory pressing a button, had the skills to over power an entire unit of trained officers and parkour his way out of a mansion.  He effortlessly took down a millionaire(or ""In Time""'s equivalent) in poker, with no reasoning behind his ability to do so.


The poker scene!  Holy shit what a terrible scene!  For those of you who know the game, this is how the life-depending(literally) hand went down.  JT had 250,000 years to his name.  He ""knew"" that his opponent had hit 3 of a kind with his pocket pair of queens(demonstrated by his following line, ""It wasn't a luck, yada yada"" and bet 50,**000** years on an open ended straight draw with one card left to come(he hit the straight in the end).  There were 8 cards in the deck that could have made his hand, and he pot committed himself on a draw.


The last section of my rant concerns the big climax, the battle with the leader of the minute men.  WTF was that, who has the strongest forarms?  They made no attempt at all to make it seem like a battle of brain power.  Why does having your arm on top of theirs make any sort of difference? JT's strategy was to allow his opponent to drain all of his time down to seconds.  Then, overwhelmed by his potential victory, he loses focus and JT gains the upper hand.  Why couldn't this douche then realize JT began fighting back, and say, ""God damnit, let me just finish him off.""  This loss of focus lasted approximately three minutes, when the antagonist clearly noticed what JT was trying to do right away.  Aaaand lastly, JT adopted this strategy from his father, who was supposed to be a legend in ""fighting"" with that strategy.  BUT HE WASN'T!

Juno is a beautiful story. It walks the line between happy and sad, laugh and cry, so well you will find yourself doing both. Sarcasm, cynicism, wonder, and hope mesh perfectly in a communication of Juno's feelings, and the combination of what is going on both on and off the screen is sure to keep you interested in what the movie has to say.

And Juno definitely has a lot to say. An unplanned pregnancy at 16 creates expectation. Supportive parents, a loyal friend, and the dependable presence of the father all at once seems too good to be true. It is, in a way. Juno learns that she can't plow through growing up. She has to take something from it. She tries to maintain an indifferent attitude, and the battle between her cool attitude and the undercurrent of childlike dependence, wonder, and joy is present throughout the movie, as evidenced by Rainn Wilson's brief role as the sarcastic store clerk, Juno's making a noose out of licorice rope, her interactions with Paulie and Mark, and even the simple, almost novel, yet intelligent soundtrack. Much of the movie's brilliance comes from how it incorporates Juno's changing philosophy on life as her experiences try to change her, from the blunt and almost dark mood, which reflects her initial refusal to allow the world to move her, to the pure sorrowful and joyful emotion that emerges as emotion appears behind the mask of indifference as Juno begins to grow. The movie shows growing not as a change from simplicity to indifference, but a change from indifference to a simplicity of another kind. Maybe I've misinterpreted the whole thing or I'm overthinking it, but I think it's beautiful either way.

I can't write about Juno without mentioning the superb acting by the two stars. First of all, Ellen Page, or Juno MacGuff, was perfect. Just perfect. I remember watching Juno and noticing I had not noticed anything about Page's acting. She was just being Juno. Then it hit me. The reason Page's performance was so brilliant was hiding in plain view. I had subconsciously credited everything Juno did to Juno. My silly brain had told me Juno was Juno. No Canadian, no actress, no Ellen Page. At second glance, however, I was struck by how in-tune Page was with her character. She played Juno so convincingly I felt and actually believed Juno's world-weary armor going down, her confusion, her anguish, her wisdom, her joy. I've not seen many performances like that. Page definitely created a masterpiece. I thank Ellen Page from the bottom of my heart for that amazing performance. Next up is Michael Cera, or Paulie Bleeker, the father. I just want to get something out of the way: Michael Cera is a genius. He has mastered the art of unspoken communication, of pauses that say so much more than any monologue could communicate, and this skill complements offbeat Juno perfectly. In the scene where Juno tells Paulie he is the father, Page and Cera turn a potentially dry scene into a rather insightful emotional one. When Paulie hears the news, you can see his internal struggle. You can sense all the things he has wanted to say for a long time boiling inside him while he stands there, lost for words. Michael Cera was the perfect choice for Paulie, and it is made more and more obvious every scene he shares with Page.

I highly recommend Juno. If you haven't seen it, please please please see it for yourself!",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1hqn2z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1hqn2z/ijw_juno_2007/,

This film, which is an adaptation of a play by the same name, is the story of composer Antonio Salieri and his deep admiration, yet deep hatred of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his plan to kill him.

The story is quite moving. Salieri's war on Mozart, who he sees as God, is engaging and at times intense. It takes some expected turns, but you always feel attached and you want to know how it all ends. 

What *really* makes this movie is the characters. Salieri, played by F. Murray Abraham is a cunning, intelligent man whose internal conflict over his admiration and envy for Mozart tears him apart. He feels betrayed by God who saw fit to give unparalleled musical talents to Mozart, who he felt didn't deserve it, and leave him in the dust only with the need to be that good. The best scene was when, in his old age, he tells the priest his plan to kill Mozart and become a musical God in the eyes of the people. He says it with such intensity and passion that it scared me a bit. 

Never before have I simultaneously loved and hated a character until Mozart, played by Tom Hulce (who is also the voice of Quasimodo in Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame). He is a playboy, a party animal, a lude, egotistical, and rude man. But he's also an undeniable genius with a great passion for his art. I also felt sorry for him because of the large shadow cast by his father, even after he died. Tom Hulce did an amazing job in realizing this unpredictable character.

Another good character is Mozart's wife, Constanze (played by Elizabeth Berridge). She was a strong character who absolutely loved her husband, with all his faults. She was the level-headed one in their relationship who was always concerned about their financial situation. She would go to certain lengths to make sure that she and her husband had a good life. I really liked her and loved it every time she was onscreen.

As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed this movie. I could even say that I loved it. The story, the characters, I would definitely watch this again. I *need* to.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1hafdj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1hafdj/ijw_amadeus_1984/,

I won tickets to an advanced screening of the movie last night, and let's just say, at least it was free.  Walking out of the theater, just about everyone was grumbling about how lousy it was.  Will Smith is a great actor, but he really didn't do much in the movie.  Will Smith's son is a horrendous actor, and he was by far the main focal point.  Everyone had these weird deep south/british accents that made them sound like 5 year olds with speech impediments, and it made most of the dialouge difficult to take seriously.  The plot had quite a few holes in it, and all in all its entertainment value was just poor.

I have a huge fondness for coming-of-age stories and as such have been looking forward to seeing the highly acclaimed This is England. Pleasantly, the film hits all the right notes and entirely lives up to the hype. Featuring newcomer Thomas Turgoose in the performance of a life-time as the young Shaun whose troubled youth and thanks to a series of events goes down the wrong path and into a community of skinheads. Lead by the menacing Combo, brilliantly played by Stephen Graham, Shaun finds himself brainwashed and surrounded by a group of detestable characters.

The strongest aspect of This is England is arguably its authenticity and how believable the transition of Shaun is. Although always hot-tempered he initially feels lonely and practically worthless as if life is letting him down. With Woody and later on Combo he finally feels loved again, blind to all the harm he is doing as a result of being part of a radical hate group. It's done in a gradual way with enough subtlety to be convincing, but still featuring a bunch of intense scenes that made me feel slightly uncomfortable. Turgoose may have worked with a fantastic script but he really does deliver a fascinating turn as the young skinhead and he is what holds the film together.

**8 / 10**

We live in an era of remakes. As I type, I know that the entire Oldboy/Sympathy for Mr Vengeance/Sympathy for Lady Vengeance trilogy is currently being re-written for a Hollywood remake (and let's not even get into how much that makes me seethe); but I also discovered last week that the 1970s classic 'Carrie' is currently on its second remake. That's right folks, apparently we need three versions of 'Carrie.'

I'm sure each film will have its own take and one should not be judgemental, however, within this subreddit, it poses a problem.

**We need to know which version of a film you are talking about**. And the only and best way to do that is an IMDB link.

Readers may not always agree that IMDB have the best content (I am not a big fan), but when it comes to accuracy in terms of film dates and re-makes, you cannot fault it.

**If you do not post an imdb link in your submission, your submission will be deleted.**

We give people fair warning. We post in each thread reminding you. But we have come to notice that some people ignore mod requests for IMDB links and carry on about their Reddit business regardless. Being fair people, we give you a fair amount of time to respond to such requests. If your post history shows no subsequent activity, we’ll be lenient.

I was skeptical that I would enjoy this movie at first because it was written by Diablo Cody (not a huge Juno fan, didn't have any interest in seeing Jennifer's Body), but I gave it a viewing anyway, and I am glad I did.

Charlize Theron's character Mavis is stuck in her adolescence (because it's basically her job) and has a mental breakdown when her book series ends and her ex-boyfriend has a baby, prompting her to visit her hometown.  The characters were uncomfortably true to life - anyone who's grown up in a small town would recognize a few of them at least.  Mavis' seductive attempts to win her married ex-boyfriend back made me cringe with both hatred and pity (""He's not happy!  I can tell!  Sometimes things work out!  People get divorced!"" etc).   

The main reason I watched Young Adult was Patton Oswalt, one of my favorite stand up comedians, as a cripple who ends up being Mavis' drinking buddy during her stay.  Though he played a more serious role, he still added a unique persona to the cast of characters.  It almost felt like Theron represented girls who love Twilight, and Oswalt represented boys who hate that girls love Twilight - a distinction laid out by Oswalt's line ""Guys like me are born loving women like you"".

Also, while I think they overdid the references to his mangled genitals, I think his sex scene with Theron felt like a victory for awkward 20-somethings everywhere.

Anyway, to conclude this directionless ramble, if you're looking for a dark comedy that is uncomfortably true to life (and you don't mind seeing Patton Oswalt take his shirt off), I'd check this movie out.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_r3y12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/r3y12/ijw_young_adult_2011/,

I must say I was intrigued by it. I'm not one to usually enjoy this sort of film (Horror/Thriller) but there was something about it that was quite interesting.

- Michael Pitt was so delightfully horrifying and Naomi Watts was excellent as well.

- Great script and direction. I was very intrigued by how Michael Pitt's character was so relentless and was communicating with the audience to give them entertainment.

**What I didn't like:**

- I was slightly disappointed by Tim Roth's performance. I feel like I've seen him do better and his accent was all over the place.

I went to see this film with only a brief understanding of the plot, not having read the book. I can safely say this is a masterpiece of a film, and quite possibly cinematic perfection.

Without wanting to spoil anything, the movie is about six separate stories taking place in different periods of time, with the overarching plot making the connections between these stories - some aspects are obvious, some less so (the kind of fridge brilliance which comes to you a few hours later).

It's directed by the Wachowskis (*The Matrix*, *V for Vendetta*) and Tom Tykwer (*Run Lola Run*), so you know you're in safe hands. The score is beautiful, encompassing the stories brilliantly.

A couple of things to bear in mind ~~if~~ when you watch it:

* it weighs in at 2hr52, so you'll want to make time to watch it (it's not the kind of film you can pause and come back to the next day)
* this is a film which requires your full attention: don't watch it in the background or if you think you'll fall asleep partway through - there are several parts which, although not crucial to the plot, are what help connect the stories and add to the layer of brilliance

I've always been a fan of Wes Anderson ever since randomly borrowing a copy of The Life Aquatic from a friend but oddly enough I didn't really watch any of the rest of his filmography until last year. I'm not quite done with him yet but I'll be stunned if Fantastic Mr. Fox, the last one I have yet to see, turns out to be better than what is now my favourite work of his. The Royal Tenenbaums is probably his most critically acclaimed film and frankly it's not hard to see why, even if it deals with the critic's favourite subject of a dysfunctional family. I'll be hard-pressed to find a family more dysfunctional than the Tenenbaums and were it not for Anderson's direction the comically over-the-top quirkiness of each individual would quickly become irritating. However, and I really don't know how he does it time and time again, it simply works and despite being obscenely quirky the characters feel genuine.

Very often funny and at times highly saddening, The Royal Tenenbaums might just be Anderson's most complete film to date. It touches upon many issues, family-related and romance-related, with a warming sensitivity, making sure that every character is of equal importance and slowly creating a bond between each one of them of which most aren't aware of until the end. It's quite astonishing how there is not a single weak, even among the supporting cast, and it really reminds me of The Life Aquatic in which Anderso achieved a similar feat. The performances naturally play a big part in this and they are appropriately fantastic, off-beat when needed but, crucially, played in a heartfelt manner. As a result the last 10-ish minutes are charming and moving in a way that is just so rare in any medium, a wonderful closure to a wonderful story about a group of genuine characters I really cared for in the past two hours.

The excellence in storytelling is met in the production design of the film, particularly in the costume and general art direction. Every character is unique in appearance and the abundance of colours in their costumes plays really well with the set design, especially the house of the Tenenbaums. As expected, it has spectacular framing, lighting and everything I've come to love about Wes Anderson's style. In the music department he once again landed a hit and his selection of songs for certain scenes continues to amaze me as he is consistently right in every decision in that regard. The Royal Tenenbaums is a rewarding experience rich in emotion and heart, boasting a plethora of great performances, and is an instant favourite of mine.

Ok, I have been waiting a long time to finally get to watch this because I just wanted to see for myself how bad it was. As if it hasn't been drawn out how ridiculous everything about it is, I still gotta review it.

In simplest terms, it's bad. Johnny is...Johnny. Denny is a creep. Mark is brain dead. Lisa is a psycho. Lisa's mom definitely has breast cancer.

While the movie is terrible in it's regards to acting, directing, writing, mise-en-scene, everything...at least it had some (I use the word some lightly) production value. Internet shows it had a budget of $6 million. But, that's the only ""redeeming"" factor. Other than the fact it was hilarious. I burst out laughing every time a sex scene came up. The very first one was so awkwardly funny. And the music was so bad it was great.

If I had to choose Birdemic or The Room as the worst film I've ever seen, I still pick Birdemic. But this one is up there, and honestly, I'm glad I got around to finally watching it. Now, what bad movie do I need to watch next?

One line occurring during the first faceoff between the Hawks and Ducks and the Hawks player says ""What is this the Oreo line?"" referring to the Duck's line of two black kids and a white kid.

Was this a common practice in 90s movies or was Mighty Ducks just pushing the limits?

As a fan of Boyle's work, I had high expectations for Trance and was not disappointed. The movie starts off like a typical heist movie with a painting being stolen at an auction. The protagonist and auctioneer James McAvoy gets hit in the head during said heist but is quickly revealed to be a part of the heist. The story moves towards trying to glean the information of where the painting is through hypnosis of McAvoy and we are introduced to Rosario Dawson's character as the hypnotist.  At this point you realize that this film has just begun delving into its many layers that make infinitely different from a heist movie.

As the hypnosis begins, I found myself second guessing the three main characters, McAvoy's chief accomplice in the heist, Dawson's hypnotist and McAvoy himself. The journey to the outcome explores the human psyche of fear, sex, greed and love and the outcome itself is surprising given I had pondered various different scenarios throughout the movie. The movie is unique in only a way that Boyle knows how, the plot excellent, although at times can be a little over the top, but nevertheless, makes for a great movie.

Well, I enjoyed the movie for sure, although the main attraction of the movie isn't exactly the human characters.

The best moment in the movie demonstrates this, [when Tom Felton's character says to Caesar 'Get your hands off my your damn dirty ape!' and Caesar bellows back 'NO.' It was great.](/spoiler)

The movie manages to stand alone as a gripping drama of apes revolting and manages to slot nicely into the canon of PotA movies, which is very lovely. Performances, effects and music are all top-notch, which makes for a great, tightly edited 100 minutes feature.

After all the hype I feel like this movie has gotten from the horror crowd, I was pretty excited to see it. It seems like it's been a long time since a really good horror movie has come out. I consider myself a big fan of scary movies so I'm always dragging my husband to them, usually for duds.

The Conjuring was good. It was a very solidly good movie. I can't say it was *great*, but I think that may be because my expectations were too high. It was like The Amityville Horror and The Exorcist had a baby (but also like James Wan directed it, which is nice IMO). The style was very spooky and the music was a *big* part of the chill for me. The noises and subtleties made the movie. If you need good visuals for a decent scare then I'd still recommend The Conjuring! It's no Evil Dead, but I'll say I definitely got chill bumps.

To fans of Wan's other movies, you'll love The Conjuring. It has a better foothold in reality, so even for those that weren't quite fans of Insidious or Sinister, you'll enjoy this one.

I went to watch this movie without knowing anything about it because I get premiere passes to a lot of stuff.

So, no expectations while going in, here's my review :

White House Down is being marketed as an Action/Thriller while it should be Action/Comedy. Channing Tatum does quite a good job playing a kinda goofy Capitol Policeman.    
As we know from the trailer, President gets attacked and this guy is the only one left who can save him, standard shit really.

So, when you watch the movie you get bored initially because it plays out **exactly** how you expect it to. Infiltrators get in, blah blah.    
So, first 45 minutes I'm just sitting there waiting for something to happen. But after that, things get interesting. I mean, the plot is still cliché as fuck but the movie turns from action to full on comedy, I mean seriously.

Jamie Foxx is absolutely not fit to be the President of anything, I don't know if it was him or the shitty script but he didn't feel like the president. He felt like a mix of Django and Motherfucker Jones.    
It really was quite distracting watching a President make such jokes and engage is such frivolity. 

**But**, Jamie and Channing were epic together. The jokes they made had the whole theatre in stitches and they singlehandedly made the film worth.

The ending was a mother of all clichés and I felt like I was watching a bloody Bollywood film. As an Indian, believe me I know how fucking weird endings can get. Emotional drama, feel good fuckery, this film had it all.

**TL;DR : Went for action, stayed for the comedy and clichés. Go in expecting a comedy and you'll love it. Anything other than that and it's a waste of your money.**

What can I say? This film is one of my all time favourites, it is one that requires your full attention but that rewards the effort put in tenfold. There are stories within stories, fantastic levels of detail all too easily missed, national and personal tragedy interwoven beautifully.

In addition, the premise of this film is unique, at least, not one I have seen elsewhere, a quiet apocalypse, far removed from the perennial war or pestilence. All in all, it just felt *real* in a way other similar films, even the fantastic *The Road*, fail to do. Though this may just be personal bias - I live in and around the areas the film is set.

Special mention must be made of the cinematography, in particular the director's use of single-shot sequences at pivotal moments, lending an almost documentary-like air to the film, coupled with myriad tiny references to historical images and events.

This is a film that I would heartily recommend to anyone with the time to watch it properly, fully, giving it the justice it deserves.

I am going to assume that spoilers are unnecessary as this is a book adaptation. So, I felt that it was a very accurate portrayal of the book and that it did not deviate very much. My only real qualm was that Jordan did not have much to do with anything and could have almost been removed. The other thing I found odd was the use of modern music in place of original music. I can understand it from a stylistic standpoint as it did make the scene seem more extravagant and exuberant, but I can also imagine people cringing at the extreme inconsistency. The characters were exactly as I had imagined them to be, and the acting was decently done. The symbolism from the book was essentially shoved in your face, especially the colors, the ""watching"" billboard, the extravagance, and the green light, but it all worked in my opinion.

I'm sad to report that Roger Ebert (much-loved film critic) passed away today,Girlwithnousername,18,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1boty0/some_relevant_news_for_a_film_review_sub_im_sad/,"I have read Ebert's reviews of films I've just watched for many years now, and have found myself to be in thorough agreement with him 99% of the time. I think I once found a 3.5/5.0 review that I thought should have been a 4.0/5.0 but when I googled it a second time, I found that he'd re-reviewed it twenty or so years later and raised his rating to a 4.0. So, Mr Ebert and I were very like-minded regarding what makes a good film and what constitutes a stinker. 

“No good film is too long” he said.

He worked for the same company for over forty years and battled cancer for most of a decade. He lost part of his lower jaw as a result and it left him with a remarkably changed appearance; some unpleasant people were publicly harsh and critical about his new appearance and it was terribly upsetting, but Roger battled on and resisted the temptation to hide himself away from those who chose to judge him by his appearance; something I myself could never put my hand on my heart and say I would be brave enough or bold enough to do. He has my utmost respect and I hope he has inspired those who may struggle with their appearance to feel more confident in their own skin/body.

I am very sad at his passing. I hope some readers will take some time this week to check out some of his reviews before and/or after you watch films. He was an excellent writer and really captured the essence of what was best, worst or simply most mediocre in a film and whilst I don't aspire to write reviews as great as Roger's, I always keep him in the back of my mind when I am writing a film review here (if I wrote in the kind of detail he did, nobody would ever read them!). 

For those curious enough to spend some money, he has an app called 'Roger Ebert's Great Films' where he lists reviews of around 200 of his favourite films (none of the mediocre or stinkers are on there). It's probably a couple of pounds and it's a film list worth slowly working your way through. He published various books too, although I have never read any of them.

In the meantime, happy film watching, happy reviewing, and rest in peace Mr Ebert. Thank you for thoroughly inspiring me to continue seeking out great films over the years (and for bringing my passion to this sub via being passionate about keeping it alive, growing it and moderating it well).

[The Host (2013)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517260/)

After seeing this movie, I have grown to give Stephanie Meyer another chance. I somewhat liked the Twilight movies and books at certain points, but overall, they were pretty meh to me. The complicated love story in them just didn't get my attention like it did for the target audience of the movies and books. I was mainly drawn to the curiosity of Meyer's portrayal of vampires. Like probably everyone else, the whole *sparkle in the sun* dealio was not to my forte, but the violence is what actually kept me going with the series. If Meyer did away with the complicated romance plot, I would have liked Twilight more. 

With this movie, I was attentive throughout the whole movie, and its subtle romance part was actually bearable for me. Since today was Easter, I saw it with my mom, and it felt like she liked the Twilight series more than this while I felt vice versa. The premise was pretty interesting and blew away my initial thought of this moving being another remake of ***Invasion of the Body Snatchers***. I could see some viewing it like that in a way, but the alien invasion in this was more...*peaceful*, but still a *creepy peaceful* at that.

Saoirse Ronan, who is turning out to be one of my favorite actresses around my age so far, did a pretty good job in this movie. She had to basically play two roles in this, one being ***Melanie***, the human host, and the other being ***The Wanderer*** who was the alien inside the human's body. Melanie gets into this state because of an incident that leaves her body basically in a vegetative state. The alien-controlled humans use some type of medicine to heal her and then insert the alien into her body, giving The Wanderer almost all control of the body. The movie goes onto an adventure on how Melanie and The Wanderer try to find any remaining humans that could possibly fix this mixing of two beings in one.

If you combined all 4 Twilight movies (or 3 if you think the 3rd and 4th ones shouldn't have been split up into two parts) into one, they still wouldn't be enough to grab my attention like this one did. This movie actually made me think of what the next step would have been besides knowing the predictable plot the Twilight movies had. Even if I didn't read the Twilight books, I bet I would find the plot in those movies still predictable. After seeing this movie, I actually felt a want to read the book and to be the first to get my hands on the second book if it hasn't come out already. The ending of his movie didn't really feel like it gave away any hints that there would be more, but I would definitely or see or read the sequel.

I was *somewhat* kind of surprised by some of the graphic violence in this movie that I had no idea would be shown in it. One scene in particular was... [SPOILER](/s ""some dude literally getting his head shot off, and when he fell to the ground, there was a pool of blood around his head. I think there might have also been some brain parts."") I bet that might freak out the main audience (people who saw the Twilight movies and who probably wanted to see this since it was based off the book written by the same author), but it was just another thing that pulled me in. I barely remember anything that graphic in the Twilight films, but the closest was just people getting their heads or limbs ripped off and magically not having blood splurging out. 

Yeah, it was cool movie in my book and I'd definitely see it again if I ever have the chance to. I'd rate it a 7.5/10 and would recommend it to people who want to see something based off of Meyer's books that isn't the dreaded *Twilight*. I'm sure she's passionate about her creation that is *Twilight*, but I, like many others, just don't see the same passion for it, but I did with **The Host**.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1bdr0i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1bdr0i/ijw_the_host_2013/,

I'm a fan of Harmony Korine, and although I was conflicted while watching the film, my feelings are mostly positive. 

The film has entertaining visuals. The heavy use of neon and day-glo colors make for some memorable images. Ideas about youth culture, hedonism, and creation of identity are what immediately stuck out to me. The last 30 minutes of the film were the best as the environment transforms from a high-energy party to a nauseating roller coaster you want to get off in the best way possible. A sequence scored with Britney Spears' ""Everytime"" is one of the greatest music montages in recent memory.

The film's success is marred by poor performances from Selena Gomez, whose emotional range is nil and Gucci Mane, who seems almost completely lifeless in the role of James Franco's nemesis. The performances from Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson are surprisingly good, but their characters (along with Rachel Korine's) are one dimensional and can barely be distinguished from each other. 

Some editing choices such as the repeated use of the same sounds, identical shots and reused dialogue are hurtful and become tiresome. 

Not a triumph in tight editing or dramatic performance, but powerful in visuals and subtext as well as intriguing storytelling. ",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1ajhxz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1ajhxz/ijw_spring_breakers_2013/,

I was towards the bottom of the ""Horror"" category when I noticed a flick with giant letters reading THE STUFF on the cover, so I decided to watch it, because drugs make people do silly things.

What followed was an incoherent story about this stuff (literally - that's all they ever call it) that oozes out of the snow.  It kind of looks like mayonnaise.  The people of America soon decide that it's the best thing ever and it starts selling like crazy.  

One little boy sees the stuff behaving STRANGELY in his family's kitchen and decides he doesn't trust it.  His family is addicted to The Stuff (actual product name) and they say that he can't be in the family if he doesn't eat it.  At one point, he eats shaving cream and pretends it's The Stuff to appease them, and then vomits.  That part was pretty funny.

Also, there's some smooth talking hot shot private investigator played by the most hateable actor on the planet, and he's been hired to figure out JUST WHAT THIS STUFF IS.

Their paths randomly collide somehow and they form an alliance.  The stuff continues to brainwash the country because of the awesome PR campaign that the people who sell The Stuff have embarked on.  Hot Shot Private Investigator starts banging the PR Director.  Everyone is hooked on The Stuff because it is addicting.  Apparently the writers couldn't decide on just one evil thing for the Stuff to do, so it also starts making people explode.  

The movie continues and you begin to fast forward to get to the scenes where they fight the Stuff.  They usually just set it on fire while it ominously sits in a corner of a room and jiggles.

Then the little boy gets captured and put in a truck by the Stuff people; these are people who have eaten The Stuff and are now controlled by it, instead of detonating anytime the story needs some action.  Hot Shot Private Eye and Unnecessary Female Co-Star rescue the kid from the truck by taking the truck.  The Stuff threatens the kid, but ultimately does nothing and just sits there.

Hot Shot visits his army buddy at some secret army bunker in the jungle somewhere.  Paul Sorvino plays the army buddy and is the only decent actor in this entire film.  I believe he knew it as well, and seemed to almost unwillingly deliver a good performance.

Anyway, the army guy helps them blow up some Stuff, I think.  I was smoking more pot during this part.  

Then we find out that the people who hired Hot Shot to investigate the Stuff had ulterior motives, and now they want to sell the Stuff and profit.  Hot Shot and Little Kid have other plans, and the movie takes a really unexpected dark turn.  They force feed the evil CEO-types The Stuff at gunpoint and stare at them with murderous gazes.  At one point one of the CEOs actually says something like ""You don't want to do this!  You're just a kid!""

The kid replies ""I'VE GROWN UP A LOT""

DUN DUN DUN

They watch the CEOs eat themselves to death, and then take cases of the stuff with them.  Cut to:  some random van selling cases of The Stuff to sketchy vagrants in some shithole alley.  After that, the movie just kind of ends.  Did the main characters just become drug dealers?  What the hell?  I don't know what they were going for here, but I walked away from this film with the absolute wrong last impression, I believe.  

It was fun to watch from the snarky post-modern angle, but I could have spent that time doing something much more productive.

The Haydon/ Prideaux relationship also was a bit of a tell- because if we are covering up prideaux's death, the only one close to him was Haydon- so it points quite a finger at Haydon.

* some of the acting was reallly hammy (January Jones' eyes don't act, and James McAvoy was OTT;

* the story wasn't strong enough to keep me gripped;

The lesser evil:
 
* Xavier was an intolerable, conceited, hypocritical douche whom I couldn't root for (although, given the juxtaposition between him and Magneto, I think this is intentional, but his conceit and increasing disregard of Mystique should have been toned down quite a bit); 

* couldn't understand Pixie still joined Shaw after witnessing him killing Darwin - her expressed rationale for joining Shaw didn't seem like it would cover the murder of a newfound friend let alone fight her former teammates or be party to unleashing untold destruction upon billions of people;

* Shaw's death seemed to contradict the nature of his power

* a couple of continuity issues stood out to me.

On the plus: 

* the story had interesting ideas and with a bit of tweaking, along with the introduction of more real world issues (ie, the racism towards people of colour), it could have been a lot better;

This movie is bound to give moviegoers more trouble than probably anything else they'll see all year. At its best, Kick-Ass 2 delivers completely awesome fight choreography and action sequences. It's fist-pumping stuff that will probably generate a lot of actual in-theater applause in the movie's opening weekend.

But at its worst, Kick-Ass 2 can make those same fans squirm in their seats, uncomfortable with having just paid the price of admission for a movie so tone deaf, so misguided as to play a rape scene for laughs that will not be as forthcoming as those fist pumps. 

That unevenness is Kick-Ass 2's downfall, but watching it I had the sense that it was probably five or six tweaks away from being a really fun, memorable movie. So here's what I'm going to do with this review. I'm going to describe two consecutive scenes that happen in the middle of the movie. The first is the movie's worst scene. The second might be the best. Keep in mind the movie cuts immediately from the first to the second scene I'm describing. I'll try not to be too spoilery, but this exercise does require some minor spoilers. 

Treat this like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure. At the end, choose whether you'll venture to the theater to see Kick-Ass 2, and endure the coming mental and emotional conflicts yourself. Or don't. It's up to you. 


##MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW##

**Scene 1 (The Worst)**

Kick-Ass's self-appointed nemesis in this movie is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who decides to avenge his father's death from the first movie by killing Kick-Ass. He calls himself The Motherf---er, dresses in bondage gear, and will heretofore be referred to as MF. MF assembles a team of supervillains with names like Black Death, The Tumor, and Mother Russia, and he sets out to destroy everything Kick-Ass loves. Conveniently enough for the plot, Kick-Ass has a new girlfriend who goes by (not kidding) Night Bitch. 

MF tracks down Night Bitch and breaks into her house with a couple of his fellow villains. They proceed to beat the crap out of her, and you can tell from about a mile away we're heading for a big nasty rape scene.

Only there's a twist! MF doesn't have an erection! Oh darn it all, he has to try to get himself ready for the rape while being laughed at by Night Bitch, and everyone watching in the theater. Only it's not funny, it's supremely uncomfortable. Night Bitch ends up goading MF a step too far, and he turns around with a special kind of look on his face that leaves it up in the air whether the rape happened or not. By the way, in the comic book, it did happen.

You can see what they did there. Comic book writer Mark Millar's original scene was too much for the movie. It was controversial when the book was released back in April, and he said some things about rape in fiction that made it even more controversial.

Plasse and director Jeff Wadlow both said previously the rape didn't make it into the movie. Instead, they tried to make it an emasculating experience for the villain, but the scene doesn't work like that. It doesn't end up being about MF's humiliation because he wins, so I don't know what Wadlow was thinking with this scene. It just doesn't work. And the bad taste it left in my mouth made it hard to enjoy the following scene, which is pretty effing awesome.

**Scene 2 (The Best)**

Cut from the inside of Night Bitch's house to the outside, where Mother Russia and two more of MF's henchmen are keeping a lookout. These guys aren't keeping a very low profile so it's no wonder a cop shows up. But they weren't expecting Mother Russia, a former KGB agent with a talent for murder and destruction. She grabs a propane tank, turns it into a bomb and hurls it at the cop car. BOOM!

For the next couple of minutes, Mother Russia proceeds to deal with the cops in increasingly creative ways, including the unexpected use of a lawnmower. This is what I came here to see. This is what happens when casting, writing, and creative stunt and fight choreography come together in a way that makes you just love watching it. And it all centers on a Russian bodybuilder named Olga Kurkulina who's never done a movie before.

This scene, along with three or four others in the movie, exemplifies the kind of fun you can have with over-the-top violence. This is the kind of stuff that got me to buy comic books when I was 12, and watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie multiple times, and it is flat-out fun to watch.

The problem is Kick-Ass 2 doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a movie where we get to push the limits of that fun, semi-cartoony violence? Or is it a movie that deals with the consequences of real violence? It should be the first, but it wants to be the second. In one laughably self-contradictory scene, Kick-Ass insists, ""This isn't a comic book!"" What is that? Is it meta humor within the movie? That's deep. But no, that would be too complex. It's just cognitive dissonance disguised as social consciousness, and it deserves an eye-roll.

**Now Choose**

I've left a lot out, but based on those two scenes, you should be able to decide whether you want to see the movie. If you're feeling conflicted about Kick-Ass 2, or violence in movies in general, I've also put together a reading list that might help you flesh out how you feel. It brings in several opinions from Stephen King, Chuck Klosterman, and comic writers Warren Ellis and Gail Simone, and all of them plug into various facets of this movie.

For people who do go to see it, I hope they think about the movie more than superficially. And those who choose not to: I hope you're not going to get too sanctimonious about it. Violence has a place in movies, and any black-and-white argument to the contrary is going to make you look like Tipper Gore in the '80s, laughably out of touch, and too easily provoked.",,False,,t5_2rafo,1376687127.0,,,True,t3_1kifh7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1kifh7/ijw_kickass_2_2013/,

Fantastic movie, yet devastating. If you haven't seen it yet I'm pretty sure this movie will hit you hard. Is one of those great movies you can only see once. 

From the very beginning of the movie I started to empathise with the characters, which doesn't happen alot to me. Selma(Bjork),a humble girl who struggles for her child, is probably one of the most loving characters I've seen in cinema. Her devotion to her kid, the care and love she shows to everyone around her, and being hateless despite the struggles she is faced throughout the entire movie blew my mind completely. I was amazed, still am, but will probably take me the whole day to recover .

Before going watching this movie get ready to be heartbroken, physically ill and most likely there will be alot of onions around.

Following the theft of Ong-Bak’s head – a sacred Buddha statue – the village is prophesied to suffer grave misfortune. Ting travels to Bangkok to recover it, meeting his long departed cousin Humlae (Mum Jokmok) on the way. While hunting the head Ting falls into an alien westernised world of drugs and street fighting - which he must reluctantly fight his way through if he’s to stand any chance of saving the village.

This film really has everything you could want or expect from a martial arts movie…… stilted dialogue, wooden performances and jaw-dropping action. With a few token Aussie bad guys, light relief from a chubby sidekick and heavy religious overtones it couldn’t be more generic, with no hint of a satirical edge. The exposition is dire but mercilessly brief, with only 50 or so lines in the whole picture – but if you pick up a DVD with resounding reviews from ‘Nuts’ and ‘Zoo’ on the cover you know what you’re signing up for. Undemanding Friday night cinema at its best, rammed with fast, brutal, head-splitting (literally) violence. 

Breathtaking is a word often thrown around, but the stunts and fight sequences here genuinely take your breath away. Vicious kicks physically connecting with skulls, broken bodies slamming against floors – ‘Ong-Bak’ is an exhilarating tangible experience that leaves you whooping (or flinching) with every blow. All the most remarkable stunts are replayed in slow motion from different angles, so if you missed just how talented and agile Jaa is in realtime there’s countless opportunities to marvel at his prowess. Perhaps not as well choreographed or inventive as others in the genre, its selling point is its ferocious raw power and physicality. Clunky imperfections pale into insignificance in the face of the remorseless action. Want to see a guy on fire delivering a spinning roundhouse kick to someone’s face? You’re in the right place.

A Marshall is called upon to find a missing woman on an island that is an insane asylum. 

I went into this movie thinking I already had the plot figured out, but a few successful twists, and turns later, and I realized I had no idea. The acting is great, the atmosphere is great, and so is the writing. I found the music constantly had me on the edge of my seat even when nothing was happening. Loved the sort of horror and drama mix. I went from feeling nervous to almost crying by the end. This is a movie that demands a couple more viewings and I think it will just get better the more I pick up on and notice. 9/10",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1ep2k8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1ep2k8/ijw_shutter_island2010/,

Boy do I wish I could've seen this movie as a child. Henson's ambitious and wonderfully fantastical adventure carries an irresistible charm with it that surely would've amazed me at a very young age but even seeing it for the first time at age 20 is an enriching experience. The world that is created in this has a tangible quality to it that can only be achieved through actual sets, props, costumes and make-up rather than CGI. The importance of these things have never been made clearer than in this, as physicality and presence are things the audience can feel. Thanks to the meticulous craft that went into every one of these aspects even shoddy effects such as the merging scene towards the end are charming and very much welcomed. I may be a sucker for world-creating but rarely have I seen a place as vividly memorable as the world of The Dark Crystal.

It is true, however, that it relies on its visceral qualities to carry the film, which they do successfully, but the story itself and the characters are very simplistic and really not as interesting as the visuals. This does not mean that they're necessarily bad, but their blandness does become apparent rather quickly. Still, these issues become secondary due to how exciting it is to visit all these places and unique creatures and due to the short 90 minutes running time they really don't matter in the slightest. It's too visually overwhelming to ever be boring, sucks you into its world before you even know it and leaves a long-lasting impression that goes way beyond the end of the film. I loved it.

In all his kids-friendly movies I always thought Robin Williams was a little creepy, making the decision to cast him as the depressed, psychological train-wreck with sociopathic tendencies a stroke of genius. It seems almost as if he was born to play this role and the acclaim he received for his portrayal of Sy is entirely justified as he is creepy and unnerving right from the beginning and not once made me feel comfortable. Through fantasies he expresses his wish and need to be part of a family and for that he chose the rather rich family of Michael Vartan to project himself into. His work as a photo finisher allows him to know a lot more about said family than Vartan would want anyone to and once Sy starts to involve himself more and more in the family's life things go out of control.

As a concept, One Hour Photo is very interesting and fairly original, but before going into I had my doubts about it. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, known for his work in Fincher's films, greatly adds to what makes this such an uncomfortable watch, as his overly clean, sanitized look gives places such as the supermarket it takes place in a surreal quality to them. Somewhere I read the word heaven-like being used to describe it and that is exactly what it is. Sy is detached from reality and it shows not just in his behaviour but also in the film's aesthetics. It's cleverly done and very effective, something I've come to expect from this DP.

One Hour Photo is surprisingly unsettling and a worthy psychological thriller with a fantastic ending and a very sick mind at its core. Despite his awful actions one can't help but feel sorry for him and Robin Williams gives it his best to make him human, rather than a generic villain with a bad childhood.

Having never actually seen any of Lucas' non-Star Wars films I was rather excited what this one had to offer and it comes to no surprise that while it doesn't live up to Star Wars it's still leagues above the atrocious prequel trilogy. THX 1138 takes place in a dystopian future, controlled by computers and stripped from any humanity. Like with stormtroopers there is heavy use of whites in the film's world, which dehumanizes the place and makes everything look sterile and “too” clean. It's an interesting stylistic device used to great effect and in combination with the odd, almost awkward way the people talk to each other creates a unique atmosphere. The constant threat of the mind-controlling machines, the entirely fabricated religion and the brutally mundane working conditions hark back to the great works of Science-Fiction by Orwell and Huxley.

However, the primary concern of THX 1138 seemed to have been the visuals, which while interesting and often impressive aren't enough to keep a film alive for 84 minutes. I would've loved a little more exploring and as much as I enjoyed Robert Duvall in this it does get a little boring at times. Even Lucas seemed to have noticed this while making it and thus put a chase scene at the end, which is very well-done and a welcome change from the standing and talking. Numerous tributes to Sci-Fi classics can be found throughout, including the infamous shot of masses of workers walking through hallways from Metropolis and while it's not quite on the level as some of the stuff it pays homage to it's still a solid film with a clear goal which it more or less achieved.

I watched it a few days ago, but it's been hard for me to write a review for it.  Here goes nothing.

I am jewish, so this movie was especially important for me to watch.

I had seen Chinatown prior to seeing this, and never thought that a Polanski movie would be better than that. But boy was it ever.  It's essentially a perfect film. The only qualm I have is that we never really get to know Szpilman, but I think that's the point.

The sets are unreal. I'm not sure if it is CGI or what, but it was so real.  I felt like I was there. I took a screenshot of one scene in particular. http://i.imgur.com/1vJaukr.jpg

I never realized that the Germans made the Jews form their OWN police force to deal with the jews.  These jews got special benefits (mainly not being starved and gassed to death).  American film studios have always left this detail out, but Polanski made sure to show it to the world.

[The best scene is obviously the one where a beaten down, starving Szpilman encounters an SS officer in an abandoned house with he is trying to open a can of food.  The officer asks what he does, and after finding out he's a pianist, tells him to prove it by playing on a piano just in the next room.](/spoiler) I took a screenshot of this scene as well. http://i.imgur.com/Zm04SQl.jpg

Approximately 66% of the jews living in Europe during WWII were exterminated.  90% of the jews in Poland were killed. However, with the help of many individuals who recognized Szpilman's talent, he survived and told the story through his music.  He never left Warsaw.

This movie will change you.  It will make you go outside and kiss the sidewalk and make you realize how lucky you really are.  I think before wars are started they should be forced to watch this movie to be reminded of how we all lose our minds when it comes to war.

PLEASE, see this film if you haven't.  It deserved to be seen and heard by everyone.  Brody delivers the performance of a lifetime, and was rewarded with the Oscar for best actor. He beat out the likes of Jack Nicholson (About Schmidt), Nicolas Cage (Adaptation), Daniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York).  Quite an impressive year. Polanski won for best director and was robbed of Best Picture by Chicago.  I think down the road Chicago will be a forgotten memory while the Pianist will live on in infamy.  A huge mistake by the academy.

That's what I felt like. It wasn't the most mind-blowing movie ever but what it tried to do, it did perfectly. Everyone has thoughts like these once in a while, don't they? That they are living in a TV show and everyone they interact with are actors?

This movie was masterfully executed, you felt inclined to root for Truman and I actually self-fived (clapped) for Truman. I honestly have many things I dislike about a movie but in this...nothing. 

Loved every second of it.

A year later, and we’re at 3,479 readers, and we’re getting some really great reviews posted and some interesting discussions are taking place. 

Of course, with an increase in users comes an increase in spam and nonsense, so the moderating needed attention; the sub’s current owner /u/ARS_, recruited me and /u/DaedalusMinion a month ago; we keep an eye on the day-to-day running whilst /u/ARS_ is in Afghanistan. I am based in London (England) and /u/DaedalusMinion is somewhere in India, so we cover a lot of hours between us.  However, you’ll be pleased to hear that I only banned our first ever proper spammer just today! That’s not too bad for such a popular sub.

So, given the current readership, I thought I’d pass on some interesting statistics. 

-	December was the busiest month, with just under 8,000 unique visits
-	December had just over 21,000 page views too
-	Back in May 2012, that figure was 7,527 page views
-	January and February were 20k and 21k respectively, so we’re maintaining those nice high figures
-	This week, the highest day for page views was Sunday, with precisely 1,000 page views
-	The lowest was Wednesday, with 591
-	The daily mean is currently 767
-	**Two days ago (11th March) we hit our highest ever number of page views for one day at 1,568** (2013 data only)

Remember that you can post reviews of documentaries as well as films. I’m a complete documentary geek so I would more than welcome such submissions.

If you're an avid movie fan and go into this with low expectations, then you'll love it! For a PG-13 film, this was actually a pretty good horror film, but I was definitely torn between its positives and negatives.


I'll start with the good stuff. I really enjoyed seeing Radcliffe in my first viewing of him in a non-HP role (I never saw his *December Boys* or *My Boy Jack*). I think that, while he should probably stay away from horror films, that he'll be around for quite some time. The cinematography for this was actually pretty good too, and really helped with the scares and creepy undertones during the more relaxed scenes. I also love the way the filmmakers decided to introduce the title character - subtle, with her story being told in an easy-to-follow way without force feeding you her role in this. I don't remember what the soundtrack was like (it was more of an atmospheric hum kinda deal), but that worked SO WELL with scenes where wind-up toys were the only music (easily one of the creepiest parts of the film dealt with a room full of wind ups going simultaneously).


Now for the bad. As I mentioned earlier, Radcliffe needs to stay away from horror films. He was really stiff in this, not to mention it was insanely distracting how calmly he was handling how fucked his situation was from the very beginning. This film also falls prey to the Hollywood horror convention of getting ""scares"" out of you by turning the volume up about 12 octaves in some parts. Worst of all, this story had an extremely weak story - I barely understood/cared why he was in the town he was in, why his wife mattered (that part of the story was pretty distracting and something tells me she had a larger role in the written story). It felt like the film had 3 or 4 stories happening simultaneously, and then it only concluded 1 or 2. If anything, I'd say that the story felt so detached that you knew pretty much within the first 15 minutes that Radcliffe's character was doomed.


Anyways, I hesitate to recommend it... but if you like ghost stories then give it a shot :]

I was actually surprised that the series held up its production values, at least until the 8th and 9th movie. I'm not saying the later films in the series were particularly ""good"" but they at least didn't feel like they were cheaply made. I'll do a quick rundown of my opinion of each of the films.

1. ""Hellraiser"" - I liked it. Having watched the first three when they came out in theatres I was worried the series wouldn't hold up to my memories of it. No worries here, watching this is what made us decide to watch the series in whole.

2. ""Hellbound"" - Loved it. This is my personal favorite Hellraiser movie. I would love a 2 hour movie of nothing but cenobites fighting each other. This is also the first time you start getting a feel for who Pinhead was before the acupuncture.

3. ""Hell on Earth"" - I liked it, but this one is rather cheesy compared to the first two. The cenobites felt more like mega-man villians than they did demons from hell. ""DJ MAN"" ""CAMERA MAN"" etc. At least it was bloody.

4. ""Bloodlines"" (aka Pinhead in space) It was pretty good. I'd say it's my third favorite of the series. Decent FX, Bloody, and lots of history about the puzzlebox. Sadly this would be the last ""real"" Hellraiser movie.

5. ""Inferno"" I think Pinhead/cenobites/puzzlebox have about 6 minutes of actual screen time in this movie. It was painfully obvious that this was a ho-hum murder mystery/thriller movie that wasn't interesting enough so they slapped the Hellraiser logo on the box to get a few more sales. I was pleased at the production value though, I really was expecting the series to take a nose dive in this area after going direct-to-video.

6. ""Hellseeker"" It's seriously the same exact plot as Inferno except the shyamalan ""what a twist"" ending. I actually really liked the twist as it brought older cennobites and Kirsty from the first two movies back. Again though, this was obviously a movie that they added ""hellraiser"" to at the last minute. 

7. ""Deader"" Meh. This movie had even less to do with the Hellraiser world than the previous two. Reading about it on wiki this movie was almost done filming before they added in the parts that made it a Hellraiser ""sequel"". Again, was surprised by the decent production values.

8. ""Hellworld"" (aka Pinhead plays WoW) Actually no, Pinhead doesn't play WoW. That would imply that Pinhead was in this movie for more than 3 minutes. This is where the series seems to have just said fuck it in regards to trying to pretend that these are doing anything other than cashing in on the Hellraiser name. Also the movie seems to have been filmed on a handcam.

9. ""Revelations"" Ugh. Ok, the good part is this is an actual ""Hellraiser"" movie. It's about Pinhead/cenobites/puzzlebox/torture etc. All the things that made the Hellraiser movies poular. The bad part? It was shot in two weeks on a 300k budget. It was so shitty that Doug Bradley refused to take the helm as Pinhead. Meaning this is the only movie that he doesn't have a role in.  The only reason this was made was so that New Line Cinema wouldn't lose the rights to remaking the Hellraiser series.

If this plot sounds cliched, that's only because so many other writers have, shall we say, drawn inspiration from HoHH.

The show itself is very well crafted, particularly for its time. The viewer actually gets a sense of the layout of the house, the effects are lo-fi but effective, and after accounting for 54 years of evolving tastes in pacing I never really felt like it was dragging -- a rarity for films of this vintage. The cast all do a top-notch job of portraying their characters, and the cinematography was very effective -- particularly given the tools available at the time. Watch for close-ups being interrupted by just-off camera action intruding into the frame! Gasp!

All in all, easily worth the 75 minute run time, especially if you're a fan of the horror genre. A classic and deservedly so, but not something to blow any minds in this day and age. 

**3.5/5**

So, I went into this with slightly lowered expectations. I'm a massive Pixar fan (The Incredibles is quite possibly my favourite film of all time), and while Monsters Inc is a solid and enjoyable film I definitely don't think its their best and I really don't think it needed a sequel, let alone a prequel. I found the concept off-putting because - as a non-american - I find it hard to connect with the fraternity experience, as it bears no relation to anything I have direct experience of. Coupled with the fact that their last two films haven't been stellar (Brave I enjoyed, but it felt more like an outstanding Dreamworks effort than the great Pixar film it should have been, and Cars 2 was blah), and I was going in with mixed feelings.

Holy crap, I loved it. It was funny, beautiful to look at, clever, filled with brilliant details and references to both Monsters Inc and classic frathouse comedies like Animal House. There were some lovely setpieces, and great voicework from Nathan Fillion and Hellen Mirren in particular. In fact, the creature design for her character was particularly outstanding.

None of that is why I loved it. I loved it because I felt it took what could have been a fairly traditional story and subverted the structure somewhat, to tell a slightly different story to the one I was expecting, one that didn't rely on a neat ending and a pat message. The central characters were fleshed out enormously - Billy Crystal's Mike **really** managed to rise above the fairly unrelenting comedy relief of the first film, and the growth of the pair was handled very deftly indeed. There is less action than in the first film - there is nothing to rival the breathtaking ride on the doors in Monsters Inc - but this fits the more intimate story it tells, about personal growth, and dreams, and what we do when life forces us to adapt to harsh realities. What action does take place feels like it **matters**, rather than just being a rollercoaster of eyecandy.

By contrast, the other week I took my kids to see Despicable Me 2. It was IMO basically a series of jokes, and I tolerated it (they loved it), and I instantly forgot it the moment I walked out the door. Monsters University *I keep wanting to talk about*. I think that sums up the quality Pixar have when they bring their A-Game. Maybe not top 5 Pixar, but definitely top 8.

9/10, must see.

I can't say how proud I am of South Korean director, Chan-wook Park after watching his first American film, Stoker. The fact that he wasn't swayed from his in-your-face yet bizarre directing style says a lot about how the studio felt about him. The guy is truly a phenomenal director, one of the best modern day filmmakers in the thriller department and he lives up to the hype with Stoker in more ways than one.

The movie starts off without giving you any of the typical Hollywood runaround of pointless back stories. You meet India, a teenage girl, and learn right away that her father has died and her mother is a nut job and her uncle, who she never knew about, has suddenly appeared in her life, a scenario India finds rather strange. But here's the great thing about Stoker: It's not hard to figure out where the movie is headed but it doesn't even matter. It's HOW Park gets there that makes the film so damn enjoyable. From India's depressed and socially withdrawn character played by the wonderfully gifted Mia Wasikowska to Matthew Goode's creepy sociopathic Uncle, the movie delivers fine acting, directing and style all in a nice little package. And yes, Nicole Kidman is also good here as India's mother, however, her performance isn't quite in the same league as Wasikowska's or Goode's. When you finally do find out the background on India's uncle, you're not surprised yet you're not disappointed. Park unravels the story as only it can be unraveled. He also punches you in the face with weirdness but does it as effectively as any director I've ever seen.

By the time end credits came up on the screen, I knew I had just watched a movie by a director who really knows their craft. That he, or the studio, didn't change his ways, made me that much more excited about whatever Park will do next. He's a great director and, once again, has made a great film.

I am ashamed that I would think this film was nothing special. And, above anything, I am ashamed that I didn't watch this movie sooner. I'm sorry. In case I didn't make this clear, I LOVED this movie. It was absolutely fantastic. The casting, the direction, the screenplay, everything was perfect. The film caught my attention from the first frame. Usually, when a movie uses in medias res storytelling, it's a failed attempt to make the audience more engaged in the story. But here, it works like a charm. And the narration, which is usually used as a crutch to spew a lot of exposition, gives our protagonist's account depth and realism, along with some deep and/or funny commentary. From the beginning, I was rooting for Henry Hill, the underdog wiseguy who went up the ranks ever since he was a child. Even when he does some awful things, aside from the obvious killing and smuggling, such as [beating his wife and having a relationship with his mistresses](/spoiler), we still love the character, because he's just so damn charming. Like the wiseguys, the movie is caustic, unpredictable, charismatic, and brutal. The film gives a sense of what it would be like to be a gangster; even if the portrayals aren't completely accurate, it feels authentic. The fact that many of these characters and situations are based in reality just adds a layer of believability, beyond the expert dialogue and beautiful performances. This is definitely a 10/10. For the record, I hate myself for not watching this sooner.

I really liked this movie. There are some great central performances, especially from Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko and a very young Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox. What's also great is Martin Sheen who plays Charlie Sheen's character's dad (pretty meta). I really like these real life relationships relate to characters (see Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko) and they had some really great and powerful scenes together. The supporting cast is good too with some familiar faces (hello Dr Cox and General Zod). The plot moves along nicely, with some snappy editing to boot.

Tired of being mugged and generally bored with being a nobody, he takes it upon himself to become the superstar crime-fighter the city had no idea it needed. Assembling a DIY costume from the internet and creating his alter-ego Kick-Ass a web presence, he goes out prowling the streets looking for trouble. But, woefully naive and unskilled, he’s barely up to saving himself let alone New York. Nevertheless he perseveres and improves, only to come across two genuine superheroes in the form of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his ruthless 11-year-old daughter Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) just to fall into a fight, that isn't his to have, with local gangsters helmed by Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).

‘Kick-Ass’ is stylistic, riotous fun that effortlessly encapsulates the mood of a comic. Both blackly funny and exhilarating, it moves with rapid pace – thanks to sharp, energetic direction – and is as easily digestible as flicking through a book. The cinematography does an excellent job of mimicking illustrated panels, providing an experience close to the speech bubbles and black outlines of the printed page, with constant narration from Dave helping to express this further. 

Intense flashes of graphic, bloody violence and a feeling of genuine threat are what separate ‘Kick-Ass’ from its contemporaries. After seeing another wannabe superhero plunge unceremoniously to his death in the opening scene, there's a constant feeling that Dave is never safe from harm. It's a far more invigorating experience because of this – when Kick-Ass is getting his head pounded into the concrete we feel every blow. The film may be utterly over-the-top, but Dave is one of the most accurate teenage losers you’ll see in a genre movie, as awkward and cringeworthy as we all were/are. The film's real star though is Moretz’s Hit-Girl, a sweet angelic daughter whilst at home, and a highly trained merciless killer when on the streets – a conceit that will trouble many – but it's no more than mischievous, outrageous fun.

Aside from all the poppy visual enjoyment to be had, there is much to savour in its satirisation and celebration of the superhero genre. It is as self-aware as the teenage boys it’s about, but continual reference to this just adds to the fun – mocking the cliches, then ploughing on with them anyway. But it's predominantly a superficial experience of colour, pop culture and violence, with everything presented to excess. There is no strong emotional pull, but as the journey is such dark, exhilarating fun this matters little. Both ‘Kick-Ass’ and Dave Lizewski have the confidence and ambition to try something new – one more successfully than the other – and the effort alone would have been admirable, but the film is executed with such cohesion and spirit it deserves to be elevated over many of the movies from which it derives.

An interesting movie.  It was directed very cliche like, which was very boring.  However the idea, of no law for 12 hours is without a doubt interesting.  It was simply not executed nearly as well as it could have been.  While a few scenes did hit me as entertaining, overall it was a boring film.  

The idea was solid, it was portrayed not nearly as well.  

It does bring up a very interesting perspective of class warfare however.  This could potentiality take it to a deeper meaning, but unfortunately from my perception this was hardly touched on.  Ethan Hawke does deliver though.  

5/10

if this film portrayed a global Purge.. that would have been so much more interesting.  Granted a ""house invasion"" purge was probably more.. affordable.

The Road is a post-apocalyptic story based on a 2006 book, which I read and enjoyed, which is why the film was on my radar. As a film it is deeply deprressing, if interesting and engrossing. Initially the film jumps in manner that for someone unaware of the story I believe would be disconcerting, though it soon hits its stride. The story walks the line between too little information for the viewer and too much expanation masterfully, with the father-son scenes that make up the bulk of the film expanding not just their relationship but the world in which they live. The pacing is solid and despite being an old cynic I found myself genuinely caring for the characters.

The Road is a refreshing change, it isn't the story of larger than life heroes and villains writ large upon the screen, there is no clear moral compass. Instead it is a world of greys, a statement complemented by the film's palette. This is a story of normal people in exceptional circumstances and all the more powerful for it.

Aside from Viggo Mortensen's powerful presence on screen I would have to give a special mention to the cinematography which truly evokes a feeling of desperation and hopelessness that sets the scene perfectly for the drama that unfolds.

1370173949.0,16,self.Ijustwatched,1fik1a,IJW: Das Boot (1981),Girlwithnousername,17,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1fik1a/ijw_das_boot_1981/,"Das Boot (‘The Boat’) is a tale of life and war on a German submarine, a U-96, during WWII. 

The first third of the film focuses on building up a picture of life on a U-boat for the viewer; the repetitive nature of day-to-day life, the sheer boredom: ‘do you have nose hairs? I bet you do too; we should inspect each other’s nose hairs’ - or something very similar (this is after watching a crew member pick his nose and inspect his findings in front of his fellow crew mate). Dinner in the Captain’s cabin displays similar bouts of boredom, they closely inspect the way other crew members eat, scrutinise every movement, and in a revolting display of shipmanly knowledge, on one occasion diagnose that a man’s genital crabs have reached his eyebrows at the dinner table (‘that’s stage five’) – shudder.

So you get the picture. It’s very slow moving, but you’ll gain an appreciation of the boredom, see how claustrophobic such a small space is and how it has the potential to drive the sanest of minds to another place, and there is some extensive character development along the way, so you can’t really skip it.

When the action begins to take off, well, it’s frankly mind-blowing. To watch this film 32 years after it was made, well, my mind boggled imagining how they managed to achieve such amazingly realistic cinematography way back then. A quick read of Wiki tells me that it had budget of 32 million DM ($18.5 million), and was the second most expensive German film production to date upon its release. So that solves that puzzle. 

You are left in no doubt as to what it feels like to be on a U-boat which is being attacked, you can feel the fear, you can feel yourself bounce off the equipment. You may start to hyperventilate a little as you watch the crew members grow paler, break into cold sweats and become increasingly panicked as they start to submerge from 180 to 220 feet and can barely breathe. 

Similarly the scenes involving enemy craft and bombings are equally realistic. I won’t spoil the plot by going into detail, and other than to say they are put in some extremely precarious positions, I would just urge you to watch it for yourself instead. 

At 3 hours 19 minutes, [it requires some time commitment]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iMWb8nEOG4), and you may find the dubbing of one character’s voice extremely irritating, but I am told the actors dubbed their own voices, so that’s an irritant you’ll just have to cope with. You can also find the German version with subtitles which I intend to look up; I suspect I may prefer to watch it in German. For the really brave, I’m told the Directors’ Cut is 4 hours long. Bear in mind that it may be a struggle to get through the first third but that it serves a purpose, and I hope you will really enjoy this film.

This movie was so much fun! This was my first time ever viewing it and I was taken aback how cool it was.  I was expecting something a little better than an average movie but I was sorely mistaken. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the action scenes and the visuals were stunning of both Iowa, Space and the Vulcan homeworld.    

I really loved all the throwbacks to the original series with having most of the major crew members like Kirk, Spock and Scotty and all their trademark lines.  The space battles were also really exciting with the Enterprise going through debris filled space and destroying other vessels.

I began watching this not entirely sure what to expect from it and whether you read up on it or not probably makes no difference as Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain is such an eccentric and unique piece of film-making that it's impossible to describe properly. It demands to be seen, consumed and digested with no hope of regurgitation since it defies conventions at every turn, shocks the average audience with strikingly violent or repugnant imagery and seemingly does so randomly. However, the true triumph of The Holy Mountain is that there actually is a point to what is happening on screen. The problem I've always had with non-sense type Dadaism is exactly that, it's simply non-sense, but despite its surreal, utterly grotesque qualities this film is actually about something. Its political and anti-consumerist themes are put in the foreground, giving what at first glance seems like pure claptrap an air of intelligence.

The reason I enjoyed this as much as I did is that it is genuinely witty, doesn't shy away from showing the extreme and does so with spirit and care. Jodorowsky clearly believed in his work and it shows, as it's an absolute blast to watch without ever being condescending to audiences. It's an infectious piece of madness that is handled beautifully and will surely stay with me for quite some time to come. Not only is it all of those things, it is actually very impressive in its production with a number of odd set-pieces and a plethora of weird props and costumes that keep up interest at all times. The Holy Mountain is an instance of mad, completely bananas film-making that manages to keep just enough coherence to be an engrossing and enlightening experience. Jodorowsky didn't just brainstorm for things that he thinks look cool or shock the Average Joe, he made a point with this film and made it clearly enough to be picked up by just about anyone, while keeping a feeling of mystery and secrecy.

I'm frankly shocked that this turned out to be as entertaining and interesting as it is and will now gladly add myself to the long list of Jodorowsky-followers.

I had been meaning to watch this for a while, and I finally got around to it today. Directed by Don Bluth, the film is about a field mouse named Mrs. Brisby, the widow of Johnathon Brisby, trying to save her ill son with the help of a group of rats who had a connection with her husband that she never knew about.

Overall, this film is pretty good. The story is fascinating, and surprisingly dark. The best thing about the movie is the character of Mrs. Brisby. She is inspiring. She's a very kind mother who would do anything to save her child, even in the face of danger. Her character is one that I think will stick with me. 

What I didn't like though was that some of the acting sounds kind of stiff, Dom DeLuise's character was just annoying, and I could have used more scenes with Jonathon. I guess the intention was that he was supposed to be an unseen force of good, but I would like to actually see him do good things and act like a good person. But these things weren't bad enough to detract from the film. I think I'll watch it again in the near future.

DISCLAIMER: I'm American.  Many things went over my head.  This is not speculation.  This is fact.

I don't know how to react to this.

It's the darkest comedy I've ever seen.  There are scenes that were apparently played for comedy, but that I watched and thought, ""That's pretty sweet,"" or ""That's a harsh line.""

[Feisal's death](/spoiler) reportedly was often met with outrageous laughter as was Omar's son's line ""He'll be in heaven before his head hits the ceiling.""  The former made me say, ""It just got real,"" and I met the latter with more fascination than anything.

The final montage after [the jihadists succeed](/spoiler) was underscored with what sounded like ""Mad World"" and the dialogue was so brutal--and plausible--that I could only think, ""Damn.""

Now this is not to say that I met the film with only confusion.  Riz Ahmed and Kayvan Novak were brilliant and brought real humanity to their roles.  [Omar's goodbye to his wife](/spoiler) was beautifully performed on both sides.  Some scenes, like the opening ""blooper reel"" or the attempted crow bomber, were hilarious.

As their paths cross with eccentric local rapper and small time gangster, Alien (James Franco) the girls are seduced into his dark world of violence and drugs, finding the excitement and danger lacking in their normal lives.

Exploitation cinema has had a rough ride in recent years – trashy examples from the 70s and 80s are often considered kitsch masterpieces, receiving nostalgic screenings and the framed poster treatment; more contemporary efforts (Piranha 3DD, for example) are critically panned and derided. Fundamentally the movies are the same – there just isn’t that retrograde VHS grain that makes them acceptable to like. So with ‘Spring Breakers’ we have a pure piece of modern exploitation dressed with acceptability – a highly regarded (if controversial) director in Harmony Korine, a cast of former clean-cut teen stars (Hudgens and Gomez were both Disney girls), an A-list leading man and an art-house aesthetic and structure. 

Not driven by narrative or character, it’s more of an audio visual assault of pop culture, with more tits, guns, drugs and teen angst than a 16-year-old's Tumblr feed.

Chopping back and forth in time, replaying scenes and dialogue, it unfolds more like a bunch of hazy memories. Thanks to the endless energy and pace it’s still completely compelling, and as funny, sexy, and sleazy as it needs to be to hold the attention. Much of this is down to Franco, who is fantastic as the bizarre, manic Alien – nailing all the movie’s best lines and creating a character who will surely pass into cult status. 

Shot with the leering eye of porn and pop videos, it has a mix of mainstream gloss and frenetic voyeuristic handheld footage, spliced with grubby digital YouTube clips. Painted with a seductive colour palette of tanned flesh and bright clashing neons, paralleled with Florida’s dingy underworld, the colours linger in the memory far longer than the film itself. The construction works fantastically well, capturing the raw energy of youth – perhaps a comment on pop culture and our consumption of content in short bursts, but you’d have to really want to see it. That being said, Alien showing the girls round his house exclaiming “LOOK AT MY SHIT! LOOK AT ALL MY SHIT” certainly says something about our material culture and compulsion to ‘share’, and the our skewed idea of ‘making it’. There are also some well-observed truths about female friendship and adolescence – the recurring theme of wanting to stay locked in a moment of youth is something we can all relate to; as is the sense of invincibility every teenager feels, where no actions have consequences and horrific experiences only afflict others.

Ultimately it’s a hugely enjoyable slice of filth that passingly works as a superficial satire of youth culture. With no real depth, this sleazy, titillating, frantic ride delivers more than enough entertainment – but leaves an urge to have a good shower afterwards.

I was almost positive that Seven Psychopaths would disappoint me because of how much love I have for In Bruges.  That being said, Seven Psychopaths is also amazing, so don't always judge a movie by the trailer.

The film is a tale of madness and morality.  It's also extremely meta; Colin Farrell plays ""Martin"", a screenwriter who has an interest in the insane (who does that sound like?).  He's attempting to write a movie that intertwines the lives of seven different psychopaths - characters Martin finds inspiration for among the personalities that inhabit his own world.

The acting in this film is fantastic.  If you've been excited for Seven Psychopaths because of the cast in the trailer, you were right.  Christopher Walken was hilarious; I believe I laughed the hardest at his lines (it feels like ages since I've been fascinated with his acting).  Sam Rockwell pulled off his looney character with gusto as well.  I could literally say the same thing about Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson, and Tom Waits (though the trailer made it look like he was a much bigger character than he actually turned out to be).  Fans of Boardwalk Empire will also enjoy a cameo scene from Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt at the beginning of the film.

That's all I'm going to say about it now.  Go see it.  I am fairly confident that you will like it if you enjoy darkly hilarious, well-written movies.

I haven't explored much of Terry Gilliam's filmography, though I've been impressed with what I've seen so far (12 Monkeys, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).  In TIODP, the immortal Doctor Parnassus and his band of traveling sideshow folk invite participants into the depths of their own imaginations and offer them a chance to embrace enlightenment.  If they reject this nirvana, Tom Waits steals their souls.  He's the devil, though he goes by Mr. Nick, for some reason.  The devil and the Doctor have a very interesting relationship based on bets about the nature of man, which I found very interesting.

Anyway, I thought the plot was pretty interesting.  When I heard that Heath Ledger had died during the early stages of filming, I wondered how his absence would impact the quality of the storytelling.  Turns out Gilliam was able to interweave the appearances of Ledger's A-List friends (Depp, Law, Farrell) into the plot pretty smoothly.  Ledger's character, Tony, is a smooth-talking man of many faces, and when he enters the imaginarium each time, he becomes one of the other actors, and they all have slightly different personalities.

Other notable actors included Andrew Garfield (who I never really noticed as a great actor before, but he was pretty fantastic here), Christopher Plummer (of course), and Tom Waits.  Tom Waits should be in more things, and he should never try to play any character that isn't a shady motherfucker.  Just saying.

Anyway, this visually-striking film reminded me about the importance of storytelling and imagination, and did not fail to entertain.  

RIP Heath Ledger.

Goes without saying if you cannot stand found footage or film anthologies, this film and its original are not for you. I for one, miss horror Anthologies, so this series has always gotten a pass from me. The original was far from perfect, but the found footage shorts prevent you from being bored with any one particular concept for very long. Before you know it, it's on the next tale... and again, much like the first film: none of the shorts are terrible and one or two stand out -which is what makes an anthology good. 

I'll do my best not to spoil anything below because I really like this series and I think many horror fans would enjoy it. 
Each short really kept my attention. Some started out as decent concepts that ended being pretty cliche. One particular zombie short I thought was not very clever, ended up being actually more clever than I thought. 

The stand out short is the one about the cult. Gareth Evans (director of The Raid: Redemption!) is certainly someone to keep an eye out for. It's not perfect, but there are some serious creepout performances (the cult leader is great and believably insane, as well as some of the cult members -real great casting in that respect). When the shit hits the fan in this one, it explodes into a bloody mess! I loved it and I was totally hooked! But on the other hand, [there is a monster prop at the end that had me grinning with slight embarrassment](/spoiler), but all in all, a complete high-fivin good time. 

Jason Eisener (Hobo with a shotgun) does a short, which I thought was the weakest of them all. Especially since the first film dealt with a similar theme but because it was more ""subtle"" and employed less cheap scares than in this short, it was more effective. Spoilerant: [Furthermore: I'm so sick of aliens that look like ""grays"" that can travel across the galaxy but once they get here they walk/crawl/growl like some primitive beast. I'd be happy if we no longer depict aliens like humanoid grays, thanks.](/spoiler) 

All in all, a solid film that stands next to the original, not that the original was anything to write home about. In a world of serious major studio disasters, I found V/H/S and it's sequel to have a bit more fresh air and fun and entertainment: and hell aren't movies suppose to be into that kinda stuff?

In the realm of superheroes Wolverine is one of the most humanly interesting, a man blessed with the power to heal but cursed with immortality – destined to outlive everyone he loves as he searches for meaning in an endless life. And this is the darkness ‘The Wolverine’ attempts to study, exploring his character and inner lament rather than telling some vast apocalyptic narrative. Following the events of ‘X-Men: The Last Stand’, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a broken man living alone in the American wilderness – when he is unexpectedly visited by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) and cajoled into journeying to Japan to bid farewell to Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), an elderly influential businessman whose life he saved during the Second World War. But Yashida’s ulterior motives, and a violent power struggle within the family, force Logan to become more entwined in these strangers’ lives than he imagined – driving him closer to Yashida’s granddaughter, the equally conflicted Mariko (Tao Okamoto).

In taking a more reflective approach to the genre this feels like a smaller, more personal film. With a small cast of characters and a focused linear narrative (which unfortunately ties itself in knots in the process), it keeps Logan as the centre and attempts to relate all events back to his personal trauma. This does occasionally become clunky, but plenty of touching moments intertwined with Japanese culture and mythology demonstrate there is at least something intellectual taking place. 

This doesn’t have the big-budget gloss and finesse of the average summer blockbuster, but the exotic setting and the novelty of a familiar face adrift in a strange land does much to keep the experience compelling. A succession of expertly handled action scenes truly capitalise on Logan’s close-quarters, ragged fighting style, and refreshingly show him getting hurt and actually requiring time to recover instead of dusting himself off and springing back to action. A small detail but it adds weight to the action, and a palpable sense of threat. 

‘The Wolverine’ is an admirable attempt to use a multi-million dollar blockbuster as a character study, but these two styles are constantly at odds and in the end prove mutually detrimental. With many moments to enjoy – not least a breathless, original example of a fight atop a train – it certainly isn’t a failure, but as the overblown climax draws to a close and you think back on the strength of its earlier movements it’s hard not to feel slightly dissatisfied.

I was disappointed. This is one film that has been consistently praised, raising my expectations to levels it couldn't reach. I was expecting something more morally grey, rather than the more stark lines painted in film. There are shades of grey, but far less murky than I'd thought.

Whilst this film is set in London, there are signs that it isn't British. For the most part the choices of phrase are accurate, but there are a few slips, namely British police referring to elevators in one scene, schedule pronounced skedule and Portman's meandering accent.

I found that V set it self up for a finale that it couldn't deliver, I struggled to find any empathy for the characters. Rather than simply displaying them and allowing you to make a choice as in the original comic, the film pushes you to a conclusion a bit too forcefully.

All in all, if you want a comic book film that is complex and leaves you with serious questions about morality and the human condition, V, despite the hype, isn't worth it. You'd be better off watching (the) Watchmen.

I did not really know, what I expected: I knew little about it, did not watch any trailers or anything. Maybe I expected an authentic, light, non-cheesy romance. But I got a quite depressing ""romance"". It was a great movie experience though. 
The script was indeed authentic, although both characters, Dean and Cindy, were slightly exaggerated - but they perfectly fit in this whole tragedy of a relationship.
Over the whole movie it is hard to side with one of them. For me, Cindy was annoying and demanding, whereas Dean was pitiful and pathetic. But in the end, I really did not know how to feel. One could understand the attitude and behaviour of them both, because they have their very own problems with themselves, their relationship and their lives.  
Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams did an awesome job in presenting a couple, which is attracted to and distracted from each other.  
I really loved the way Cianfrance chose to narrate the whole story by using time leaps. I could easily follow the plot without losing the golden thread, but it kept being interesting.  
And I was fascinated by the fact, that some social-ethical tabus were slighty, not so obviously touched, so the viewer could ask him-/herself: ""What would've I done? How would've I reacted?""  
  
I definitely suggest Blue Valentine to everyone, who does want to deal with a social and ethical theme and who does not want to be entertained in a positive, funny, light way.

While stranded in Philadelphia with his wife and two daughters, reports of a global rabies epidemic begin to surface. But it immediately becomes apparent that something far more serious is afoot, as a plague of zombies swamp the city around them. Receiving word that his skills are needed by the UN, Gerry and his family are transported to their HQ on an aircraft carrier, but for his family to remain within the relative safety of the boat, he is forced to abandon them and help the UN mission. Tasked with aiding a virologist in discovering the cause of the outbreak they are jettisoned to South Korea, but this is only the start of Gerry’s journey that sends him to every infested corner of the globe in search of answers.

Firstly, it’s complete and utter nonsense – every decision seems wholly ridiculous and unexplainable, with endless plot holes littering the journey. If you begin to critically deconstruct ‘World War Z’ you’d be left with little more than a dismembered rotten corpse. Fundamentally the film’s set-up is flawed so it’s always going to feel a little unsatisfying – but in terms of escapism and genuine thrills there is a wealth of moments to enjoy. It mercifully avoids too much exposition and instead fills the screen time with well-handled set-pieces and some decent scares. Attempts to rationalise Gerry’s quest often grind the film to a dull halt, but the next bombastic piece of action is never too far away. The vast zombie hordes suffer from slightly ropey CGI but they’re undeniably impressive, and all the close combat is handled with some excellent special effects and gripping tension. A pounding Hollywood score helps to keep excitement levels up when much of what’s happening isn’t particularly emotionally involving.

This is less a zombie flick than a classic Hollywood disaster movie – an A-list star charged with inexplicably saving the day alone, facing setbacks at every turn. Vast implausibility obviously runs through it, and is at times hard to ignore, but it’s part and parcel of the genre, so with a little suspension of disbelief it’s still entertaining enough. Pitt is solid in what is an incredibly two-dimensional role, adding at least some weight to the part, but this isn’t really a film about character – it’s all about the spectacle. Although derivative and uninvolving there’s some decent nonsensical disposable fun to be had, but that’s about it.

I've heard good things about this movie, so I decided to give it a watch. *Drive* is about an unnamed mechanic/stunt driver/getaway drive played by Ryan Gosling who gets mixed up in a robbery gone wrong.

I have to say, I was disappointed. I didn't go in thinking this was an action movie (I was told many times that it wasn't), but this movie was boring. The few action scenes that were in it were great, but the characters were boring (especially the mostly silent protagonist), the conversations they had were uncomfortable and awkward, and the story wasn't that interesting. The good things about this film were the aforementioned action sequences, the 80's style music, and the cinematography. I also liked how the very last scene was done.

So, I really enjoyed the LotR trilogy, and I was excited about The Hobbit, but less so once I heard it was being stretched to three films. This first part has many of the right pieces - an excellent cast with great performances, the same incredibly realised Middle Earth from the LotR films - but they're put together all wrong.

It is far, far too long, and yet manages to compress important parts of the original beyond recognition in its rush to jam more stuff in, most especially:

* The encounter with the trolls plays out completely differently to the book, a crime when it is one of the most memorable parts of the book. Why change it? All it brought was pointless slapstick and illogic (the dwarves are on a spit, they don't stop cooking just because the trolls are arguing, etc).
* The escape from the goblins was utter, utter tosh. Over-the-top ludicrousness that was completely unneeded, and again destroyed the pacing and character development from the original, breaking the point at which they noticed Bilbo was missing.
* The bit with the wolves and the trees was again completely different, and unnecessarily so.

I spent the entire film oscillating between eye-rolling irritation and eye-rolling boredom. I'm just disappointed that with the ingredients available, this is the film that got served up. Seriously, if you wanted to make a film that was that different from The Hobbit, why make The Hobbit at all?

I guess I'm being hypocritical. I quite liked the LotR films largely because I never really got on with the books. Purists were endlessly irritated by the changes, but I saw them as necessary compromises to compress the enormous story into just three films.

The Hobbit is a book I absolutely love, however. It is written with a much lighter tone than LotR, with AA Milne-esque asides to the reader. It is playful and delightful, rather than ponderous and portentous like LotR. Given my attachment to the book, and that these changes are *expansions* to drag it out to 3 films (and thus totally unnecessary artistically), I am far, far less forgiving.

The synopsis is hard to explain without spoilers, but basically it's a crime/family drama told through 4 segments (about 30-45 mins) following 4 different characters whose stories tell 1 overarching story.

The only real complaint I have is the pacing. The first segment is very slow, (and the longest) and as soon as it picks up it is over. And The second segment is (seemingly) pretty unrelated. It almost feels as if you're starting a new movie. It takes about 40 mins for the second segment to reconnect itself to the first, and once that happened I was completely ok with it, but while it was happening it left me very confused as to where the story was going.

As a result of relentless advertisement on the television, I figured I'd watch Warm Bodies, which appeared to be a zombie rom-com with a heart. The film features Nicholas Hoult [who you *might* just recognise from his roles in About A Boy and Skins, despite the thick layers of zombie make-up], and Theresa Palmer. 

Hoult plays a zombie called R - who appears to be the only living-dead creature who has some sense of human emotion and love, who bonds with Julie [Theresa Palmer], despite being against eachother in the fierce battle between humans and the ex-humans. 

Despite this rather sweet premise, I found the movie to be slightly disappointing. Nicholas Hoult appeared to lack any sense of comic timing and discernible emotion within his long, dreary monologue at the start of the film, which is about as entertaining as chewing through a piece of cardboard. Unfortunately, other than John Malkovich [y'know... because he's JOHN MALKOVICH], the same can be said for most of the actors in the film. Despite some hints of writing promise, the talent doesn't particularly shine in this film, and most of the actors are quite forgettable.

Stick with the film, however, and after a while, you'll realise that the film is a zombie-echo of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet [if you didn't expect that after seeing ""R"" and ""Julie"", then you might want to just sit in silence and have a long, hard think about how you missed that], with many similar themes and occurrences between the two tales. 

All in all, though, I suppose I wouldn't turn away from Warm Bodies if I was forced [or asked?] to watch it, but it won't be going on my ""watch again"" list.",,False,,t5_2rafo,1371255760.0,,,True,t3_1gcpr1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1gcpr1/ijw_warm_bodies_2013/,

The Asylum is a studio that focuses on ripping off popular blockbusters with a microscopic budget and the production value of a High School project, changing the title slightly, then crapping them out on the DVD/Blu-Ray shelves of your local supermarket in a desperate attempt of fooling that one idiot who obviously doesn't care about their money and above all their standard of entertainment. If they had an animation studio and the rights to using a good amount of terrible pop songs, as well as somehow persuading a bunch of well-known actors to work with them, Shark Tale would be the type of product I'd imagine these people to shit out after seeing how successful Pixar's Finding Nemo was. It's a soulless, cynical, completely unfunny and inconceivably awful piece of shit that not only doesn't satisfy as an animated film on any level, it has the guts to invoke cinema classics in its pitiful attempts at humour, making it above all these things an offensive and soul-crushing experience, as film lovers are helplessly watching respected actors stoop down to entertainment levels rivalling the Mariana Trench.

Whereas The Asylum is entirely aware of their cheap knock-offs being complete crap, I am sure the people sitting in the executive chairs of Dreamworks, and obviously the voice actors, who I hope to god got handsomely paid for essentially selling their souls to the devil, are rather pleased with their “effort”. Financially, this did rather well and succeeded in bringing in a lot of cash from its poor audiences, but while the majority of people unfortunate enough to have sat through it will probably brush its awfulness off rather swiftly, everyone involved in Shark Tale has to wake up everyday knowing they've made the absolute worst animated film to ever come out of a big studio. It isn't just a dumb, annoying and ugly film (it is all of those things), it's a film with a rotten heart, and how reassuring to know that since release this has slowly and deservedly been forgotten, whilst Finding Nemo is still remembered.

The animation is ugly as sin, the characters practically non-existant beyond their supposedly cute (I'd use the term 'punchable' instead) appearance, the multiple references to other films serve no purpose other than to anger the viewers, and the entire time I was watching this inexcusable pile of corporate vomit the only thing I could ever think about was: Why Marty?

According to Steve Martin himself the best movie he ever starred in and a statement I whole-heartedly agree with. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is one of those rare moments in cinema in which everything seems to come together to form one of the finest hours of comedy to date and without a doubt the finest comedy of the 80s. John Hughes' output was already highly regarded at that point, but up until this film he focused solely on teenage audiences. The delightful result of him stepping out of his comfort zone is 93 minutes of hilarity and heartfelt characterization as we follow Steve Martin and John Candy on their trip across half of America. Martin playing the jaded cynic juxtaposed to Candy's portrayal of the big, jolly fellow is golden and despite similar scenarios having been done to death in the past still works perfectly after 25 years. The two put on their A-game and make warming to the wonderfully written characters even easier, their slowly building bromance being the driving force of the film. It's hard to look at the same film with a different cast as the chemistry is what makes Planes, Trains and Automobiles so hilarious and pleasing to watch.

As with every great comedy what really makes it work so well and also what keeps it so charming and heart-warming are the characters. A problem I have with most comedies, especially the more popular ones of recent years, is that they lack in that department. The jokes may entertain temporarily but the characters are what stick with me and, luckily, Hughes was more than aware of this. It's evident in his other John Candy collaboration, Uncle Buck, that he truly understood what makes a great comedy and in that regard PTaA is easily his most accomplished. Sure, it's very funny and occasionally even resorts to foul-mouthing (one of the best parts of the film involves Steve Martin yelling at a clerk), but gags never come before the two main characters and their relationship. The outcome may sound clichéd on paper but after the incredible journey just witnessed the ending is easily bought into, unless one has a truly rotten heart. John Candy and Steve Martin deliver their most excellent performances in both their comedic and dramatic scenes and the writing is clever, witty and moving. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a one-of-a-kind smash hit and the result of putting three comedy giants into a mixer with an extra dose of heart.

And it will not let you forget that it's funny. I think that might be one of my main problems with it. The humor often distracts from the semi serious under tone about Starks inner turmoil. Maybe some will say, ""Humor is how he distracts himself"". Maybe. But in general the movie itself is funny. Not just RDJ. heck there is a completely ridiculous scene where he is about to kill a henchman and the henchman says ""I don't even like these people"". I understand it's a comic book movie, but come on. 

Let it be heard that I don't like lengthy exposition. Hasn't worked for me much since shawshank. I think that it is a poor poor way to convey a lot of the subtext of the film, and the troubled man it circles around. Also the ending totally negates the plot and discovery of the second installment. But whatever ret-con.

I like Guy Pearce. I love Ben Kingsley. I practically creamed my pants when they showed Mark Ruffalo in the AC scene. 

Let's look at this movie how you have to look at derivative films

* As a standalone. It was enjoyable. I'm not sure it will ever be anything more. It was a film that tried to be serious and funny. It didn't work for me. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER When we find out Killian is the mandarin, is that supposed to be a twist... because after we meet trevor the audience kind of assumes anyway. Saying it out loud doesn't make it a spoiler. It just bashes it into our heads and reminds us how unsubtle this film was

* As a faithful comic book film I have absolutely no idea. I have not read any iron man. I knew the Mandarin was a main villain in the series I have no idea if they executed it well.

* How it fits in the franchise. Definitely better than 2, although this film does negate some f 2's plot lines. I just can't help but feel that Iron Man 3 was yet again just another hold me over until the next avengers..

I probably should've seen this a long time ago but it wouldn't matter too much as this film apparently forgot to age and even in 2013 is a fascinating piece of cinema. Featuring meticulous set and costume design, groundbreaking make-up, a Heston performance the likes of which only he could deliver in that manner of his and a compelling story Planet of the Apes defines the word classic. From the ominous opening one can tell that, although it's definitely partly about the sheer sense of scale, it has a lot more to offer than the ape costume. Like with most great Sci-Fi it transports the audience to a world that may share similarities with ours but is at its core distinctly different and alienating. The world of the apes is so strange it sometimes comes off as comedic or even campy but it actually feels rather authentic. It's an impressive feat and every frame makes you aware of the amount of work that went into it.

On a technical level it is very accomplished and completely deserves its accolades, but it's all held together by the excellent story of adventure and exploration, as well as the peculiar feeling of seeing a world that is practically upside down. Charlton Heston practically plays himself in this and as such convinces as the capable but mostly unlikeable Taylor. More interesting, however, are the apes themselves, who have much more to offer than their frankly brilliantly realized appearance. While on the surface an entertaining adventure/sci-fi flick it also works on a level of societal commentary and critique thereof. Culminating in the ending (which everyone knows and weirdly enough is spoiled on the poster) it constantly questions mankind in a fairly blunt but pleasing manner.

Planet of the Apes is one of two highly important Sci-Fi films to come out in 1968 and its impact can be felt even today. Don't miss out on this one.

Overall, it was head and shoulders above G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra. So much in fact that it ranks as a decent movie in general. It isn't without it's flaws though: example being it has some awkward pacing with the initial Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow subplot. There was some awful dialogue with the fake president and Cobra unit in general, but that was somewhat expected. Also, there were many characters that were introduced without any sort of backstory, such as the return of Storm Shadow and Jinx. They acknowledge Destro, but don't even include him in the movie at all

As for the good, the action sequences are top notch. Dwayne Johnson makes a good protagonist for the most part, and Snake Eyes kills it in terms of badassery. Channing Tatum's part was disappointing: they reshot a lot of the film to give him a bigger part, thus delaying the film's release from last summer. [Then kill off his character within the first 30 minutes of the film. Baffles my mind. Flint was given a big part but doesn't even do much. No clue as to why Channing Tatum didn't get that part instead](/spoiler) Bruce Willis was given a minor role with minimal dialogue, but nails it I thought. 

Overall, some hollow character development somewhat hinders the film, yet it is still a good summer action flick. It is actually well done in 3D, I thought as well. For those skeptical with the film, I'd say it's worth checking out if you're in for a good action film. 

TL;DR: 7.5/10, would recommend watching. Specially in 3D

Well, this is one hell of a gritty and powerfully revolting drama.

I say it's revolting because some of the things you view, people should just never have to witness. It really focuses on the brutal nature of humankind.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña are LAPD cops and they seem to get the lion's share of being called out to some really crappy situations with some entirely unpleasant individuals; we do see a drunk guy who had been terrorising the post man (!), but even he is quite a threatening prospect and you have no real idea how that scene is going to end; it has you on edge until it is over.  We also never know how far these cops are going to go when it comes to doing whatever is necessary to disarm or arrest people; it’s implied early on that they are pieces of shit who will go too far. But will they truly?

Other than the post guy there's a series of some of the worst out there in terms of crack addicts, gang members and cartel members too. If anybody remembers the scene in Sexy Beast where Ben Kingsley gives an outstanding performance when he goes batshit insane, well, certainly at least one character stood out to me as in a similar vein. Not seen the scene? It’s worth the price of a dvd alone. There’s part of it on the trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSVRGdHFxYc. 
 
It’s not just a shoot-em-up and arrest them film though; there’s a lot of focus on the close relationship Brian and Mike have fostered through working together; they are ‘brothers’, they socialise out of hours and obviously have a high level of respect and trust for one another. There’s fun, silly jokes, a lot of swearing and calling one another names, warmth and care displayed. But this is not a film about the lives of two cops: make no mistake, the violence is brutal. 

The film is shot with the appearance of handheld cameras; sometimes I think this works and sometimes I’m not totally sold on it; but the scene I most thought it would NOT work on (most people would be able to predict what’s about to happen in this scene), it actually was spectacularly effective. If I’d been sitting down it would have been edge of seat stuff. 

I found that towards the end I started to tire of it; it started to feel so formulaic that I began to become irritated and just wanted it over with, and that’s when it kicked back in and exceeded my film-ending expectations. 

The acting is of a good standard all-round, but I personally thought that it was those playing the roles of criminals who really stood out in this film. 

I was surprised that it was set in LA; I thought LA was all rose petals being scattered in front of your path as you walk, botox and where the 'beautiful' people gather to do lunch and buy extortionate designer dresses. If that's really what some of the 'ghetto' areas are like there, then I am quite surprised. London gets a bad rep but I've never come across streets like this here before.

**Recommend. 8.5 out of 10 for me.**  The following spoilers are why it loses 1.5 points; one’s a massive spoiler so really don’t read if you haven’t seen the film please. 

[I found it difficult to warm to any of the characters we were meant to warm too; perhaps I was just in a particularly cold-hearted mood, or maybe it’s something about the way the film is filmed or the way the actors perform their roles? I’d appreciate feedback from others who have seen it.](/spoiler)

[Probably because of the above, I found it impossible to even get choked up when either of them died; I had a bit of a moment when I saw the line of police cars driving to the service, but I didn’t get past a small lump in my throat. Anyone else?](/spoiler)

[I love that I had convinced myself that it was bloody daft that the cartel had killed Brian and just left Mike there untouched; this was a 'hit', in no real world scenario would this happen, so when we think he’s going to get away without a scratch and suddenly there’s a firing squad on him – I was very pleased with this.](/spoiler)

[The last minute or two with them chatting and laughing in the car was a nice touch too.](/spoiler)

And was that Queens Of The Stone Age I heard at the end? A quick Google tells me not, but whoever it was sounded a lot like them and this is only ever a good thing.

You see, the fault in this subreddit is that it's meant to be a discussion immediately after watching a movie. Accept...I don't know how to react to this. I don't think I've let it digest enough. I'll try my best to give an opinion though. The plot seemed to meander through most of the movie, the whole thing in fact seemed like a build up to the climax which was, let's face it, pretty fucking insane. The build up during the climax was ok, seeing the progression from him starting to question the family until the point where he snaps, that's done ok. We just never saw this side of him. He seemed like a very, suave, official man. The whole character of Joe seemed to completely flip at the end, and I can't help but feel that was the intention. I just feel like the movie as a whole didn't work. The director had an obvious end goal but had no idea how to reach it. The shock of the ending is partly due to the fact that it doesn't make sense within the movie. The whole chicken scene...I don't even... I think Joe was trying to coax Ansel to be on his side by making fun of his wife and pointing out the horrible things she did, but he stayed on her side. And if that wasn't enough there was the final ending. Oh man, that ending. So Dotte shoots Chris. I can understand that, that actually makes sense. As does Ansel's wife (Sharla I think) stabbing Chris. This was clearly in self defense. She knew Joe was about to flip his shit. But Dotte shooting Ansel? Why? I know Dotte was pissed at him for forcing her to keep the dress on earlier in the film, but they never address that after it happens. And the last few seconds. When she says she's having a baby. Ok, I can understand that. Obviously, she and Joe had sex, that's probably why she wanted to stay instead of heading to Peru. But why shoot Joe? First of all, yes she shoots Joe. It's left ambiguous and never shown, but you can perfectly imagine her doing that, hell she puts her hand on the trigger. But I digress. So, why shoot Joe? You could argue that she shoots him after he nails Chris with a soup can, but then why does she shoot Chris? The shot is shown as intentional, not a misfire.

I consider myself a pretty avid fan of all things humorous, so when I heard that Mike Birbiglia (one of the first comedians I remember being obsessed with many years ago) had his own movie coming out, I was pretty excited.  I finally went and saw Sleepwalk with Me in a theater where I am fairly certain I was the only person in attendance, which was a nice plus.  Bottom line:  the hype was deserved.  Without spoiling it for anyone who still wants to see it, here’s a brief review.

Mike Birbiglia stars as a thinly-disguised fictional version of himself named Matt Pandamiglio, a struggling comedian working in a bar.  He’s in an 8 year relationship with Abby, played by Lauren Ambrose.   When Matt’s younger sister gets engaged, the whole family starts pressuring him and Abby to get married as well.  The pressure seems to get to Matt, which he expresses through aggressive sleepwalking.

Abby and Matt start encountering problems in their relationship after they entertain the idea of getting married.  Almost as an escape from dealing with this dilemma, Matt goes out on the road doing his awkward stand-up routine in a bunch of shithole clubs spread out all over the country.  Fans of comedy will recognize a lot of the people Matt encounters in his travels, including Kristen Schaal, Wyatt Cenac, David Wain, and, my favorite, Marc Maron.  Though Matt’s stand up routine improves, his sleepwalking problems worsen, and his commitment issues fester.  

All in all, I would recommend this film to fans of standup comedy, fans of This American Life, or just fans of good independent films in general.  There are really funny moments, really sad moments, and an ending poignant enough that I’m still thinking about it several hours after leaving the theater (usually a sign of a good movie, I think).

Holy fuck this was a great movie. When I started watching it, I had no idea how long it was going to be. I am extremely glad it was just under 3 hours because it was given much more time to flesh out the story.

The first few minutes started off very slow, but this quickly picked up after William's father left. I enjoyed seeing William as a young boy to get a bit of context. I *really* enjoyed the romance between William and Murron. These moments made me smile so much, so I was thoroughly pissed off when she died.

It was great to see how the simple men of Scotland could fight against the English so strongly and ferociously. The Battle of Stirling was both hilarious and very moving. William's speech was well delivered and awesome. The middle parts of the movie were all interesting, but I have nothing in particular to rave about so I'll get to the ending.

I saw the trap coming and was nearly shouting at the scren in Ackbar's voice ""IT'S A TRAP!"" The romance between the princess (Isabelle?) was alright. It felt more forced and one-sided than William and Murron's Romeo and Juliet-esque story.

The death scene was one of the highlights. I'm not sure what part to highlight because I felt so many conflicting emotions. The very ending scene was quite pleasing and was a satisfying conclusion.

Things I liked the most/noticed some:

* The story is very very well done
* I've never been a good judge of acting, but I can't think of any bad performances or even mediocre
* Action sequences well-done
* Very nice ""mood"" -&gt; sense of dread, defeat, and confidence was well delivered
* Incredibly satisfying to watch. Not sure how to further describe this feeling. It felt like watching the LOTR for the first time... but a bit less awesome
* Camera work had nothing special
* Character development was a huge highlight. Seeing William grow up from a boy to an enraged warrior was great.

*SUMMARY:* Very enjoyable movie. Perhaps one of the most entertaining, interesting, and satisfying movies to watch. Would HIGHLY recommend this movie to almost anyone",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_od9h5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/od9h5/ijw_braveheart_1995/,

After seeing Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing for a umpteenth time, I had to write my first review of it here. You may disagree but this may be the best urban drama of all time and definitely one of the best movies ever set in the summertime. 

What makes it so great is the substance to its simplicity. Really, the story is very simple: A 100+ degree day in Bed-stuy Brooklyn that follows a colorful and memorable cast of characters as the racial tension rises with the heat. There are very few movies with so many different people you won't forget, from the Ossie Davis' Da Mayor to Danny Aiello's Sal and of course the immortal Radio Raheem. But that's only three of many great ones. Watch John Turtorro's racist Italian son of Sal give perhaps the finest performance of his career. There's Giancarlo Esposito playing a pro-black loose cannon who wants to boycott Sal's Pizzeria because it doesn't have any people of color up on it's Wall of Fame. Samuel L. Jackson plays a radio DJ but is also narrating the film is one of the more unique narrations you'll ever find in a film. 

And after writing about all those characters, I've left out many great. Yes, many more. There hasn't been a movie quite like Do The Right Thing in a long time, a slice of life tale that really digs deep into each one of its characters and the world surrounding them. That a lot of the movie is fueled by the racist views of many different cultures makes it even more impressive. Today's films rarely deal with racism in this way, using the views of the the Bed-stuy residents to depict why certain people are viewed in certain ways. One of the greatest scenes is when the Dominican man, Coconut, reflects on the Korean market owner. But there are many conversations like this, beautifully scripted dialogue that furthers the story each time words come out of the character's mouths.

I don't want to rant too long because I could write pages on Do The Right Thing. It's one of the greatest social commentaries I've ever seen from a film. In short, if you haven't seen it, you must. Not because I'm telling you to but because you've rarely seen a film made this well using so many characters on one little Brooklyn street. In fact, it almost feels like a stage plays but, instead, it's a classic film and still Spike Lee's greatest cinematic achievement.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1kcw7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1kcw7j/ijw_do_the_right_thing_1989/,

I can't stand Woody Allen movies, I really can't. Rather than go into all the reasons he creeps me out and I find him abhorrent to watch &amp; listen to, I'll list the funny bits from this movie:

A one point, 200 years in the future, they find an old VW beetle and Diane Keaton spots an NRA sticker on it. Allen says something to the effect of ""That was an organization that helped criminals get guns in order to shoot civilians, as part of a public service.""

Also the police duo with the futuristic gun that never works properly was brilliant. First use: gun catches fire. Second use: detonator catches fire. Third use: their car blows up.

When I was in sixth grade I came across a VHS copy of Sam Raimi's original Evil Dead and I ended up adopting it as my favorite movie. I would show it to my friends who had never seen anything like it and they would get freaked out. ""This is evil!"" ""Gross!"" ""I'm going home!"" The kids would say...And I'd be laughing with glee.

Nevertheless, when I heard last year that there was a remake  of my old favorite in the theaters I wasn't exactly ready to race out to see it. After watching lackluster, passionless remakes of some of my other teen horror faves I figured I had a pretty good idea what the new Evil Dead was going to be like.

I wasn't surprised. But I can't say that made me happy.

The new ED goes off the tracks right from the start. In the original movie the kids visiting the cabin accidentally played a tape recording of the words that summoned the titular evil. In the remake some dumb kid ignores countless warnings written all over the mysterious flesh-covered book he finds and decides to read the friggin cursed words aloud....for fun? But none of it is really that fun. It certainly doesn't live up to the madcap legacy of the original Raimi films, which were some of the funniest gore-fests ever made.

The remake tries to stay true to a few of the famous scenes from the originals, like the tree scene, but it is all done so straightforwardly without the wink and the nudge of the originals that it just turns into another derivative horror movie with a bunch of good looking kids getting cgi tortured.

My girlfriend kept telling me to stop comparing this ED to the originals but I was not able to do that. I don't like the changes they made in this remake. They sucked all the joy right out of the movie. The remake has gore and might please kids the age I was when I first saw the original ED, but it will never be the horror movie that they remember long after, beyond the next slick Hollywood remake they pay ten bucks to see.  Raimi's ED films were something special and original.

We’ve seen a large increase in the number of posts ending up in the spam filter lately (almost half), possibly because more people are writing reviews and aren’t familiar with the precise format required. The bot is very selective. **The title format is as follows: IJW: Moon (2009).** If you don’t put **the colon** in, it will go straight to spam. As is the case for posts without an IMDB link. 

We’ve also had two **video reviews** posted this week. They’ll be instantly deleted. However, if users feel strongly that they should be allowed to stay, let us know and we’ll reconsider. 

Finally, and I really hate to do this, I have to have a moderator whinge about **downvoting of reviews** again. We ask that reviews don’t get downvoted if you don’t like a review or disagree with the content of it. Personally, I can’t stand The Matrix, but if someone wrote a rave review of it, I wouldn’t downvote it, I’d just silently move along and mind my own business. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and whether you consider them to be right or wrong is a matter for discussion within the body of a review, if you care enough about a film to state your points. 

**If a review is a one-liner and completely uninformative, report it. It will go to spam and we'll deal with it.**

We REALLY want to encourage posters to return, and that means that perhaps they completely misconstrued a film and could do with some guidance and constructive feedback on why they are wrong; getting a barrage of downvotes and little or no feedback just gives off the perception of the sub being an unfriendly and unhelpful place, which, almost all of the time, is simply not true. 

We also tend to see this a lot with films that people really love; as /u/coolboyblue said: ['I’m sorry for you getting downvoted, it really shouldn't be that way but it seems a bunch of fanboys took their anger out on your post.’]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1ijk33/ijw_super_2010/cbbob4s) LOVE your favourite films, but goodness, wouldn’t you rather talk someone round to your way of thinking than scare them off and leave them in ignorance of your viewpoint?

It's so great when Will Ferrell can show off some real acting talent instead of playing a petulant man-child (and this is coming from someone who still watches Step Brothers fairly regularly). I thought this was a nicely paced character piece, meandering just enough to let Ferrell breathe and fill out the role. Any shorter than the 97 minute runtime would have been too little to get familiar with Nick Halsey, but any longer would have likely started to drag.

I also found that the scenes at the end where [you find out his wife cheated on him with his sponsor](/spoiler) and [his old boss tells him he probably could have gotten his job back](/spoiler) were overkill. Nick's situation (and Ferrell's portrayal) already gave a reason to feel bad for him and root for the character, and those scenes almost felt emotionally manipulative in forcing compassion on the viewer.

As a side note, I also read the [Raymond Carver short story](http://www2.gsu.edu/~libcla/carver.htm) the movie was based on and I liked the story even better than the movie.

Now on to the review... AHHHH I am so amazed this movie was everything I hoped for. Sure it was kind of cheesy (especially relationship between Newt and Herman but it was a funny cheesy kind of like the cheese on a philly cheese steak) and there's not much depth in the relationships but I wasn't expecting a love story or anything, I went to watch a robot v monster battle and that's exactly what I got. The cinematography and fighting was incredible and despite the 2 hour length I was still hoping for more. Each battle scene was unique utilizing different weapons and tactics and combatants that despite the fact that it's robot vs monster over and over again you're on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. Now to expand on some of the relationships in the movie I felt that the relationship between Mako, Raleigh, and Stacker was not touched on as much as it should have been. Besides [Stacker saving Mako](/spoiler) there was not a very definitive relationship and the relationship between Stacker and Raleigh can be summed up as captain and soldier. A lot of the conflicts (not the actual kaiju fights) between the pilots felt artificial, like the Aussies were being assholes just so there would be another subplotline. It feels like I have more criticism than good things to say but I honestly loved the movie and none of those other things detracted from the movie much but to each their own. So as the other review says, if you love action and beat 'em ups then definitely go watch this movie. If you're still searching for the meaning of life then go watch some P.T.

In this film (based on a true story) Jack Black plays Bernie Tiede, an assistant funeral director in a small Texas town who befriends a widow played by Shirley MacLaine and eventually kills her. 

I liked the style; the interviews interspersed in the film gave it a documentary feel. The acting was very well done, too. Jack Black was surprisingly good as this good, charitable, God-fearing Christian man who was pushed too far. I felt sorry for him the whole way through. Matthew McConaughey was very entertaining as the charismatic District Attorney who prosecuted Bernie.

I really liked the theme of the move. Anyone, even someone as nice and giving as Bernie, can commit a crime if they are pushed far enough. It was also very eerie that the town gave Bernie so much support, even in the face of the evidence against him. It shows how much people are willing to ignore someone's dirty laundry and focus on what good things they have done.

My only complaint (and it might just be nitpicking) was that the time period was wrong. The murder occurred in 1996, but there was modern technology in it (Macbooks and iPhones). Other than that, it was an enjoyable movie.

Slow-paced, lots of mumbling, and a static camera - &lt;i&gt;Stranger than paradise&lt;/i&gt; has just about everything I gathered about Jarmusch's style from watching &lt;i&gt;Dead Man&lt;/i&gt;. His acclaimed sophomore effort, responsible for jumpstarting a whole wave of American independent films in the late 80s and early 90s, to which he contributed many more, is narratively and visually simplistic but much smarter than it seems at first glance. What easily comes off as way too off-beat and shallow eventually develops into something very interesting and thought-provoking. Although plot-wise not much happens and one may even call it boring, it consistently pleases with bucket loads of deadpan humour, which makes the laboriously slow movement of the story not just bearable but actually very enjoyable.

It's clear that Jarmusch was still trying to find his voice with this as it's very rough around the edges, especially in comparison with the refined and slick &lt;i&gt;Dead Man&lt;/i&gt;. However, it's confidently made and never loses track of itself. Despite not seeming that way at first it's actually really about something, and its many oddities play a big part in conveying that. Loneliness, aimlessness, and profound boredom with the world around them, the characters go on a trip in an attempt to find excitement in their monotonous lives, only to find even more uneventful boredom wherever they go with the scenery being the only thing that changes.

&lt;i&gt;Stranger than Paradise&lt;/i&gt;, being such an early film in Jarmusch's career,  is quite impressive and admirable in many ways, as well as being much more entertaining than a lot of people give it credit for.

I seriously just exited Netflix. I didn't really know what to expect before watching this. All I knew of this film was that it was directed by Gaspar Noé and had tons of neon lights. The drug effects were incredible, as was Gaspar's direction. No one else could've possibly directed this movie and done as well a job as he did (IMO). The camera flies impossible distances and through walls, stopping only to provide glimpses of, well, life. It's shot mostly from the perspective of Oscar, either from his first person POV or from just behind his shoulders. There was an excellent scene (sequence of scenes?) where we follow him through his childhood. We are always behind him, watching from his perspective, as he grows. He really doesn't move much in the frame either, always just off center and standing at the same angle as the camera. This movie remains a beautiful, brightly lit blur to me now. imdb says that it's 2 hours and 41 minutes, I can't tell if it felt longer or shorter than that. But this movie did something really well, it made me feel. I really felt for all the characters as they all sort of spiraled out of control. They're stuck in the middle of events no one should find themselves in. I don't think I'll ever forget that little girl's screams. I feel as though I lived through the protagonist. I found myself referring to him as ""me"" or ""I"", mostly due to how it's shot. I nearly cried during the cremation scene. I feel that as a whole it was breathtaking. It's probably the best movie that I wouldn't recommend to everyone. It's also not as brutal as Irreversible (though one scene brought it damn close) , which was a pleasant surprise. This isn't to say that one's better than the other, they're both pretty incomparable to me. I will say though, that where Irreversible uses violence to create scenes difficult to watch, Enter the Void uses emotions. Watching Victor be told to kill himself or seeing Linda scream that she wants to die was incredibly powerful. I can't think of another movie like this one. It has the odd effect of rushing back to you at the end. The crying abruptly stops as the screen cuts to black, and you're left sitting there, abandoned almost, when suddenly all the emotions and events come rushing back.

Had the chance to check this out tonight after a friend recommended it a while ago. At only 77 minutes, I figured I had nothing to lose. The movie begins without giving much back story on the main characters, instead giving the viewer a look into what they do in their spare time; build science projects. For the first twenty or so minutes I felt completely lost, but as the film progressed I began to piece together what was all happening. The concept it follows is quite far fetched, but the idea of it is phenomenal. Time machines, body doubles, and evading causality paradoxes all play a big role in this film making it quite an interesting watch. The last ten minutes of the film give the viewer a rundown of everything that's occurred, the repercussions of their actions and what's to come. This debunked my original theory of what I thought was going on and left me in confusion. Definitely need to re-watch this one.

Guy Ritchie’s rollicking gangster caper with half the London underworld chasing the same money, starring a top drawer cast including Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Strong, Thandie Newton, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy and Toby Kebbell. A Russian billionaire, his beautiful accountant, a top mob boss, a gang of small time crooks and an apparently deceased rock star all get caught up in the pursuit of the same £7 million – with a mysterious unseen painting thrown in for good measure. All out for themselves, no one safe from being scammed or ripped off, the lies, bullets and profanities fly across the screen.

Despite imperfections, this film is full of enough individual moments of entertainment to make it decent watchable fun. Moving at a swift pace and under constant bombardment from sharp dialogue and stylised cinematography it doesn't let up enough to expose the bland characterisation and clunky storytelling. Cutting from one scene to the next it feels more like a collection of disjointed bits than a whole narrative but, despite a few misfires, individually the sections work well. The script is full of Ritchie's trademark mockney wit and is painfully self-aware but nevertheless delivers enough quotable lines and big laughs. It's testament to the quality of the dialogue that the film is engrossing despite the flat characters and baffling plot - every time it begins to drag someone nails a line and gets you back on side. Unfortunately there are a few stabs at moralising and spirituality that are cringeworthy in their pretentiousness – and have no place in something as lightweight as this.

The ensemble cast is so strong the film is able to get away with far more than it should. Butler, Strong, Hardy et al are plainly having a whale of a time strutting around and delivering sharp throwaway lines - generating an infectious enthusiasm that masks ‘RocknRolla’s’ shortcomings (one of which being the godawful title). The styling also helps — it looks fantastic with some dynamic cinematography that feels like a comic book come to life, and although derivative everything is well handled in a brash meaty style that runs throughout. Some of the action scenes are particularly inventive, and seeing Butler, Elba and Hardy take on Ukrainian mercenaries in a sports shop is worth the price of admission alone. The over-the-top style extends to the soundtrack - ballsy blues and rock swagger over every set piece.

It may have borrowed from countless others but Ritchie has created a bold, cohesive little world that’s a joy to visit for 114 minutes. A cocksure, confident film that is a bit of a scrappy mess - but has all the fun and blokey pleasures you'd hope for.

Zach does his thing, I really like him in this type of role, similar to Steve Carrell's in Little Miss Sunshine.

It's a little sappy, but I think it works here.

The movie has a lot of cool cinematography work, with musical interludes and stuff like comic overlays used over the scene, things like that.

I was excited to see Jim Gaffigan was in it, I thought he was going to be one of the people in the psych facility, but he ended up being the main character's father, which was disappointing, I kinda wanted to hear him rant as a crazy person, but maybe that's just me.

Nic Cage is at his best here, delivering two very different performances as both Donald and Charlie Kaufman.  It really shows how hard some people struggle internally with almost every decision.

I didn't like the ending however, I sort of thought it went against everything the movie was preaching. If that was the point, well then I guess it makes sense but I was a bit disappointed.

My favorite line is by Donald, almost at the very end, after he has made idiotic statement after idiotic statement, he drops this gem: [You are what you love, not what loves you. That's what I decided a long time ago.](/spoiler)

After a period of success Emily begins to suffer extreme side effects that throw everyone's lives into turmoil, and leave Jonathan at the centre of intense public scrutiny as he fights to salvage his reputation.

Captivating from the first scene to the last, 'Side Effects' is expertly constructed and paced. It manages to keep continually moving, tying the knots of deceit on top of each other without becoming unfathomable or frustrating – and in the mould of the best thrillers its secrets begin to unravel in a satisfying whirlwind in the final act. Not a particularly deep film, revealing little about its characters or their lives and commenting on the global pharmaceutical industry without taking an explicit stance, it offers most of its pleasures through the absorbing narrative and wild unpredictability. The audience share an intense journey with Jonathan as he is pulled apart by speculation and obsession, the twists and turns of which are beautifully concealed. Here is one of cinema’s greatest pleasures - the feeling that absolutely anything can happen. In one way or another most films are formulaic: it’s refreshing to see a successful mainstream picture that leaves us uncertain of the ground beneath our feet. This is a thriller that defies convention, outlandish and sexually charged – delivering far more than it initially promises.

All of the cast are exceptional, but Jude Law perhaps turns in the performance of his career as the doctor at the centre of an emotional and media storm. He is required to go from affable quiet charm to full-blown hysteria (and everywhere in between) nailing every line and tortured look. Little is known about any of the characters, but they all feel like believable human beings with unseen depth thanks to sterling work from all the actors. So even when the tone shifts from drama to thriller, a large degree of attachment has already been established. 

As with all of Soderbergh’s work, ‘Side Effects’ looks fantastic. Polished but with a real hazy individuality, not a frame feels out of place. Several nods to Hitchcock sit nicely with the contemporary design that falls aptly between clinical and gritty. A compelling film that effortlessly draws you into its tangled web – demanding to be experienced from the first second to the last.

★★★★

This is probably the third time I've seen this movie, but I always watch a movie for fun the first time, and then critically the next few times. And I **never** watch them critically with friends. That's a quick way to get friends to hate you.

 So it is difficult to review comic book movies because you have to do it as a review to the movies faithfulness to the comic book(which I am a casual Amazing, Ultimate, and Superior Spider-man reader) while giving the series new direction. The movie as a stand alone title. and the movie on a deeper level which I try to do quickly. I don't really want to get into the whole ""when is too soon to reboot"" I don't care. It's Hollywood.

* I think as a Comic Book Movie it is taking a positive new direction. introducing Gwen Stacy, Connors, the Lizard, and Peter Parker as a smart ass outcast teen gives the faithful readers what they want while giving casual movie goers and readers a like a new story to look at. I think it is worth noting that in my opinion, I would have been fine without the web shooter, it seems like the only purpose for it in the movie was to say ""oh look we gave him a web shooter"" or ""oh look he's a scientist""

* As a standalone title it's meh. The script and story are just *okay* if you ask me, but are saved by some seriously stellar cast performances (Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Sally Field, Martin Sheen did just fine for that 30 minutes he was there, and Dennis Leary why the hell not), and great chemistry. Do not even get me started on how I hope Stone and Garfield do more movies together. So great. There were some weak story moments. However, the biggest to me was Uncle Ben's death. The dude took probably and maybe if he was lucky $200 from a gas station (fine convenient store).. Then shot Uncle Ben.. I didn't buy it. Also, it kind of led to Spider-Man being a vengeful vigilante for a while. A point that was lightly glossed over. Just a reference by Leary's character then the bridge scene. It made it seem like Spider-man did what he did in spite of Leary and not because he remembered his father's words (With great power comes great responsibility, or however the hell they said it in this movie). Also I hated Leary's 'Your boyfriend is a man of many masks line"" just whatever on that. Also I don't get why connors needed to help Peter back up on the building. I think I know what they were trying to do, show that connors is a good person or that he has changed. But I found it unnecessary and weak writing (continuity mainly)

* Deeper Meaning. Obviously this movie is about responsibility. I think that is the overall theme of Spider-Man's character in his many mediums anyway, but i think it is really about our responsibility as humans for each other. If you are in a position to help others. You should be helping others. It doesn't go much deeper than that in my opinion. As always. Feel free to disagree with anything I have written

And let me tell you, Schindler's List is every bit a masterpiece as I thought. It was perfect. 

 I can no think of a single thing that I did not like about it. I am not really too sensitive, only two films have hit me emotionally before, but now it is 3. I won't say specific parts, but they are emotionally gripping. 

The acting in the film is spectacular, especially by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. And the directing by Steven Spielberg may be his best ever. It makes me happier knowing that he refused to accept any money for the film. Just brilliant!

I had seen Army of Darkness before and absolutely loved it. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies to begin with, so it's taken me a few years to ""work up the courage"" watch this movie. Not my absolute favorite movie or horror movie for that matter, but I was really getting into the movie after Ash buries Linda. Then things started picking up for me. The suspense in the basement with blood draining from everywhere was a great scene. And after Ash throws the book into the fire, I did not expect what came afterward. 

Movie was a lot bloodier than I had thought it would be, but that didn't bother me at all. I love the use of practical effects instead of the use of CGI nowadays. The fact that the film was made on such a low budget is what made me really enjoy it too. 

I'm glad I got to watch it before the new one comes out in a few weeks. Now I can tell people they need to watch the original one, and then they'll probably say, ""No way! There's an original one?"" 

Can't wait to get around to watching Evil Dead II!

If at any time she'd have let it slip the bad guys would have paid her a visit and killed her, but the 1st thing Hartigan does upon getting out is drive straight up to her front door.

I don't know if I believe in love right now.,helloalicehello,15,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/tvopc/ijw_like_crazy_i_dont_know_if_i_believe_in_love/,"I just finished watching Like Crazy. Don't read this if you plan on seeing the movie or mind spoilers.

It's one of those movies where I just sat there through the credits, feeling at once both heartbroken and empty. It reminds me, sadly enough, of how I felt after my first kiss, but that was a product of chemical imbalance and a lifetime of building something up out of proportion.

Maybe that's what this is; watching that movie felt weirdly real. Two people; one, Jacob, a tall, awkward boy with curly brown hair and big eyes (ugh my weakness incarnate), the other, Anna, a beautiful, quirky girl with skinny legs and messy hair. They fall in love in a sweet, unusual way, the kind of unusual you see over and over again in movies but it never seems to happen in real life. She writes him a letter explaining all of the feelings she's having, and they go on a first date that lasts hours and ends with them touching hands through a glass door and having the most intimate eye-sex of any movie I've seen recently. Quiet scenes and a slightly shaky camera. Faults and flaws not completely covered up. It's a sort of voyeuristic experience, watching these two. The romance is set up quickly so you have to, like me, assume the love between them and let it fill out with their glances and touches. Love, real love, that's what they're in. And I became absorbed in it quickly, as I jump into silver-screen romances at the blink of an eye.

Stuff happens, and she's banned from entering the US, after violating her student visa. And...there's something uneasy about their relationship. It seems tense and fraught and somewhat desperate. Unable to deal with the distance, they decide to end things. Jacob is at his home, and you see his new girlfriend, and it's Jennifer Goddamn Lawrence.

Now I'm confused. I'm so confused. Jacob and Samantha have an easy, lovely relationship. Anna texts him and things seem disjointed. I don't want him to be with her. What about Sam? He doesn't seem to love Anna all that much, really; his decision to return to her seems almost involuntary, as if he can't help it. He goes to England and there's no magic. They still seem to be in love, but there's something missing. The actual love, I don't know. But I accept it as love. And I'm starting to become upset by this movie.

They get married and apply for a marriage visa. Turns out that doesn't do anything about her student visa ban. They have a tense moment at a fair and walk home, Jacob trailing several feet behind Anna. Why are they fighting for this? Is it just love holding them together? They don't really seem to make each other happy anymore. They have a fight, and he leaves. He gets back together with Samantha, and she returns to Simon, her neighbor that she slept with.

It seems right, but it's uncomfortable. I'm watching a movie about Jacob and Anna and I don't even want them to be together. Simon proposes to Anna and as she hesitates, all I can think is that she's ruined the happiness of two people. Simon and Sam. Then Anna gets the call that her ban has been lifted. Sam packs her things and leaves.

Jacob and Anna meet at the airport and it's awkward. They're in love. They love each other. But it's a sad love. The last scene is them showering together, hesitant to touch each other. Then she leans into him and there are flashes to their first moments together. Same for him. The water is running over them and it's sad, it's empty, and it's depressing. Is that love? Does it happen, intense and amazing, and then as it fades you try to find it elsewhere but you never do, and all that's left is finding the person who once made you feel that way, and hoping you can remember what love felt like? They fought to be together, but why? Because you don't give up on love? When do you admit that it just isn't worth it?

So, boy meets girl. Boy and girl fall in love. Boy and girl are torn apart, get back together, separate again, and finally end up together. But it's the worst happy ending I've ever seen.

It feels like after my first kiss. This amazing, magical thing, it's just reality, and it's not that special. Maybe there is no true love, just the rush of early infatuation and the desperate need to hold on to that person forever.

The rest of the cast was a blur, though Mintz-Plasse (?) was somewhat amusing thanks mostly to the better than average dialogue he used.

It's strange the effect this movie has had one me because on one hand it was great to see Johnny Depp playing Hunter S. Thompson (A.K.A Paul Kemp). On the other, much larger hand the movie itself was horrible. I was incredibly disappointed to say the least... Regardless of how good or not so great the book was, it was still a HST book. So to take that and change almost EVERYTHING is such an insult to a big HST fan like me and I'm sure many of you as well. This movie was glamorized so much that it retained none of the feeling from the book; for example, Al's Backyard bar was a fucking BACKYARD BAR IN PUERTO RICO, that shit look like a 4 Seasons hotel bar. And the apartment, what a crock of shit: ""I'm living in this shitty apartment because the water doesn't work and I don't have a TV =[""..... That apartment was huge and awesome, in the book it was in the middle of the ghetto where motherfuckers get stabbed and shit. It's like getting a HUGE apartment and calling it shitty because the neighborhood you live in doesn't have plumbing. Fucking Bullshit. The story was changed a lot to appeal to a larger audience and frankly, it was a really bad move. The book was about the craziness of Puerto Rico in the late 50's, early 60's and one strange man being entangled in the spider web of alcoholism, women and the sun. Its about him falling in love with whats her face and her struggle with an abusive boyfriend. But no, in the movie she's going to be with a rich Crook because people don't want to watch poor people they want yachts and fast cars. A large conflict in the book was with the Newspaper owner who ends up getting a heart attack and dieing, where was that?.. Anyway, all I'm saying is that you wouldn't change an entire Earnest Hemingway book to make a movie, so why the fuck would you try to change a Hunter S. Thompson one? Hopefully Johnny Depp learned that with The Rum Diary and wont be a fucking idiot next time. It sucked to see what I was hoping to be an awesome HST movie ruined. HOWEVER Giovanni Ribisi was absolutely amazing and delightful to watch. Brazo, Giovanni

Nevertheless I could relate to the human element and even though the movie is titled Mud (McConaughy), he is just the key plot element, the story is really about the boy Ellis and through him we watch him explore, fall in love, trust, hope as well as lose hope, trust and get hurt. 

The movie builds up to a nice climax but at times the pacing can be slow. I had read amazing reviews about this movie and to be frank was disappointed given I went in with high expectations.

This movie asks the question of our existence and how we change as the world around us and our body changes. Do we still remain the same person with same principles. This is a story of three people facing problems in their life and shows how life can make or break even the best of us. The visuals in this movie are beautiful considering the budget of this movie. It will make you think about your convictions and will you change your principles if you are going through the toughest phase of your life.

I thoroughly enjoyed how twisted this movie was! The idea of showing the movie through the eyes of a serial killer as well as dealing with his internal monologue (which at points is a bit cheesy and overkill) and struggles was refreshing and unique for a horror movie, although anyone familiar with the TV series Dexter will see  similarities. Maniac has some serious gore but the manner in which it is pulled off [pun intended] has the effect of instilling the watcher with a sense of horror at Wood's actions. On top of that the movie is filled with some absolutely fantastic camera work with some beautiful shots that seem to convey a 'Taxi Driver' esque quality of dread to Maniac. And the soundtrack is even better than the camera work, phenomenal stuff, on that note, I'll probably download it now! 

TLDR; If you're a fan of the horror genre, watch this movie now.

In truth I didn't just watch this film, I saw it last weekend but wanted to give it time to settle in. It is one of those films, heavy with fridge logic that is hard, of not impossible, to fully appreciate with one viewing. As such, I am in no haste to draw comparisons with Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, two films I've seen until I can practically quote them verbatim. 

Occasionally I felt a little dragged in the plot, but it was for the most part excellent, some points I genuinely laughed in the cinema, a rarity for me (blame British stoicism), other moments were truly heartfelt and touching.

Based on Hunter Thompson's book of the same name, the movie follows a journalist (played by Johnny Depp) and a lawyer (played by Benicio Del Toro) as they travel to Las Vegas to report on a race while in a heavy drug-induced  state. 

This was directed by Terry Gilliam and him he usually makes movies that are very strange. This is definitely no exception. There really isn't a clear plot to this movie. It starts off with the characters going to report on the race and then becomes what feels like a series of drug-induced anecdotes and experiences that occur around the same time. I did like how it was like a stream of consciousness (drug-induced consciousness) and, accompanied with the cinematography and surreal images (reptilian orgy?), it made me feel like I was on drugs watching it. For the first half-hour, I wasn't sure whether what I was seeing was real or a hallucination. Depp was convincing as the journalist Raoul Duke (who represents Hunter Thompson himself) and Del Toro was pretty damn scary playing Mr. Gonzo, the volatile lawyer who always carries a knife or a gun.

Although there are many things I like about the movie, I'm not sure if I would say that I like it. While it isn't a bad movie, it's strange and unpleasant to watch. I'm sure that was the intention, but I'm pretty certain I won't watch it again. I do recommend that if you haven't seen it, you should. It's  quite the experience.

One of the very few movies I've ever seen where, even a day later, I still don't know what to exactly think about the film. I have to hand it to Refn though, the director is VERY good at making you WANT to watch his movies.

Let me start by reflecting the first thought I had: Great beginning! Loved how the movie started out. It isn't but a few minutes in where you KNOW the main guy is a hardcore, bad ass motherfucker. But One Eye also created a problem: Because he was such a good character, the rest of the cast seemed very lame by comparison, even the boy.

Moving on, that god awfully loooooooooong middle nearly put me to sleep. In fact, the only thing that kept me awake was Refn's amazing ability to capture gorgeous scenery. He really has an eye for that and this film had some stunning visuals.

Then along came the end which wasn't so bad but it also wasn't so good either. For me, it left a lot to be desired. While I understood what was happening, it didn't do the beginning or the character of One Eye much justice. I also felt a little more background and scenes with the natives shown at the end would have given the film a little more substance.

In conclusion, however, Valhalla Rising is NOT a bad film. But it's also not a great one either. It's almost a 2-hour movie showing Refn's strengths and weaknesses as a director. So, if anything, I feel it deserves an above average rating so that's what I'll give it.

Now would I recommend it? Er, this is just one of those films everyone should watch and decide on their own whether it's good or not.

Here's our first:


[The Way Way Back](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727388/)


Having both liked the Descendants, we were anticipating this film to see what Nat Faxon and Jim Rash had in store. This time around their writing had hits and misses: the dialogue was great in most scenes (although a lot of credit might be due to Sam Rockwell's amazing delivery and Alison Janney's tipsy whirlwind of snark) but the character development was all over the map. In fact, it was as if the ""development"" portion was forgone altogether, instead having characters change immediately in response to their current situation (think Duncan and the break dance scene).

The direction felt ultimately more consistent than the writing and delivered a charming and nostalgic summer tone which saved the movie from feeling too distant due to the fact that it was hard to emotionally connect with any of the characters.

Aside from loving Rockwell and Janney, we both thought it was fun to see Steve Carell playing against type. A lot of reviews have said that he didn't sell the asshole angle, but to us he seemed to play just the right balance. If he was any more of a dickhead it would have been even harder to believe Pam's character being with him.

While we were discussing afterwards, I jokingly called back to the opening scene with Trent and Duncan in the car, saying ""This movie thinks it's a 6, but I think it's a 3. I don't see it putting itself out there."" While it's certainly not a 3, I think that comes close to highlighting my issues with the movie: it seemed to hinge on a good cast and some snappy writing while falling just short of being engaging.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1jctgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1jctgc/ijw_the_way_way_back_2013/,

For a while, everyone was talking about this movie. Also, for a while, I was writing movie reviews on IMDB. I hadn't seen this movie before today and I haven't done a review in quite a while. As luck would have it, I just stumbled on this subreddit and this hasn't been reviewed yet. So, here it goes!

*Sideways* centers around Miles (Paul Giamatti), a loser writer who can't get a break and his friend, Jack (Thomas Hayden Church), a washed up but still semi-successful actor. Jack is about to get married, so Miles plans to send him off with a bang in California wine country.

I feel like *The Hangover* series is a more juvenile version of this film. It's basically two hours of the characters getting drunk and making bad decisions and then having to work to resolve the problems they've made, but done in a more serious way. Also, instead of date rape drugs, they're drinking lots and lots of wine. And, at times, it's actually pretty funny because it's not just dick and fart jokes!

A major theme in this movie is acceptance. Characters make TERRIBLE decisions and other characters must chose how to react to these decisions. Another more underlying theme is a lack of completion. When is something actually complete? When *should* something be complete? 

I really liked the acting in this film. Giamatti plays the perfect loser and you truly feel bad for the guy. Hayden Church, however, takes a bit more. His character is a *terrible* person, and you'll either love him or hate him. Even though they're both great and they have great chemistry, I kept wondering what it would have been like if Jeff Bridges landed the role instead. I feel like he would have done a better job.

I thought this movie would be about a couple of guys my dad's age getting too drunk and getting into shenanigans. It's actually about way more than that. Yeah, there's lots of drinking, but I this seems to be more of a vehicle for an overall statement about acceptance and completion. When are we actually finished with what we are doing?

The beginning was kind of drawn out with a long opening, though when it has the initial clichéd panoramic shot of scenery with music played over it, it introduces the two main characters and begins to set the scene fairly quickly and they're rather likeable, or were to me anyway.


I'll not go into the content for too much for those of you whom have yet to watch it, though it has been out for 32 years so you have no excuse!


One of the first few scenes portrays a small gathering of locals in a classic small village British pub and they're immediately frosty to the two young American, which I found to be spot on and gave me a chuckle as I've seen it first hand.


Though the ""special effects"" if you can call it that (you can get better at any costume shop) are fairly naff, I can put that down to being a product of it's time. I found the plot to be more gripping than your average Zombie/Vampire/Werewolf film and I actually identified with the characters and in some instances empathised with them.

It's got the standard twists and turns of a film of it's kind but also has a few decent jokes here and there and does tug on your heart strings too. 

I think I agree with the 7.5/10 [that IMDB gave it.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/) as it isn't the *best* film I've ever seen, but is far from the worst I've seen this year and is a good way to kill an hour and a half, I'd definitely recommend it for anyone into horror films ^though ^it's ^not ^that ^much ^of ^a ^horror ^film .",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1iwp3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1iwp3t/ijw_an_american_werewolf_in_london_1981/,

*Brazil* is a film about an office worker in a dystopian future whose assignment to correct an error eventually leads him to finding the woman of his dreams and becoming an enemy of the state.

This film, directed by Terry Gilliam, is a strange one. This bizarre dystopian world full of tedious bureaucratic procedures, steampunk technology, and....air ducts....is both confusing and interesting. It satirizes bureaucratic society and our ability to ignore problems as long as we're comfortable. The scene in the restaurant at the beginning is absolutely hilarious. The characters themselves are over-the-top and funny, especially Robert DeNiro as the rogue air conditioner repairman.

The story is pretty good, but got strange (not in a good way) when Sam Lowry (played by Jonathan Pryce) met up with Jill Layton, the love interest (played by Kim Greist). I didn't get their relationship. It felt very sudden and strange that Jill would try so hard to avoid Sam, but trust him so quickly. It's a weird romance, but it is a Terry Gilliam film so weird is expected. The ending was amazing, though and had me saying ""what the fuck"" every few seconds.

Overall, *Brazil* is a strange, confusing, over-the-top, and hilarious satire on society. If you like movies like that, pick it up and give it a watch.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1hsjmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1hsjmp/ijw_brazil_1985/,
1371139793.0,11,self.Ijustwatched,1g9wq5,IJW: Psycho (1960),ben_smith_123,12,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1g9wq5/ijw_psycho_1960/,"Hitchcock’s unbearably tense, timeless thriller about Marion (Janet Leigh), a usually mild-mannered secretary who exploits her employers' trust to steal $40,000 to help her recently divorced, cash-strapped boyfriend. During the drive from Phoenix to his home in California she encounters a policeman who eyes her with suspicion and begins to follow her. Disorientated and distressed during a fierce stormy night she pulls into the entirely vacant Bates motel to spend the night. The genial but peculiar Norman (Anthony Perkins) who runs the motel and cares for his invalid mother alone welcomes her in and cooks her dinner, but Marion’s visit takes a sinister turn that leaves her determined to head home and face the consequences of her theft. 

Beginning under the guise of a crime thriller it’s the film’s unpredictability that draws you into its dark world – and is never less than thoroughly absorbing. The mystery of the odd motel is the real compulsion, but there are still two well-drawn, sympathetic characters in Norman and Marion. Janet Leigh produces a great performance of determination and vulnerability, spending a large portion of her screen time silently alone in the car, with trepidation writ large across her face. Perkins' mix of affability and mania is equally impressive, fuelling our ever-growing sense of unease. The acting has the slightly pinched feeling of old cinema, but it unquestionably retains some naturalism and humanity.

Much of Psycho's power lies in the music, paralleling menacing eerie strings with a light and genteel travelling theme. Ranging from the highest pitch to the lowest, its erratic staccato score remains as mercurial as the narrative, and is capable of eliciting a great visceral dread. The script is as sharp and succinct as the title with not a word wasted. Flashes of black humour and dialogue bordering on the profound really capture something about sin, loneliness and regret. 

Every frame is so well constructed and beautiful that ‘Psycho’ can never really age, owed partially to the fetishisation of 1960’s styling and design, but nevertheless the looming shadows, tight crops and haunting establishing shots would look flawless in any time period. Clearly produced on a small scale, the inventive, ambitious approach to the cinematography adds an enhanced degree of value and it’s easy to see why it has passed into cinema legend.

An ageless mystery, verging on horror - everlasting proof that budgets are not everything: it’s imagination and resourcefulness that create the strongest cinema. ‘Psycho’ will still be shocking and entertaining in 50 years, something that can’t be said for many of its rivals.

How Mackendrick's hilarious dark comedy managed to fade into relative obscurity over the years is baffling to me. The Ladykillers is a true gem in the genre and easily one of the funniest films of all time with its unique table of characters, pitch-perfect comic timing, and a moody setting. Katie Johnson as the polite old lady, oblivious to the fact that she is renting a room to the mastermind behind a heist, is brilliantly funny and perfectly cast. It's impossible to think of anyone else playing that part, although weirdly enough she wasn't initially meant to be cast and only got the role after the woman given the role first died before filming. As tragic as that is, the film benefited hugely from this, as she nails both the comedic aspects as well as the human aspects. It's easy to warm to her character, which is especially important for the second half of the film to work at all.

Rounding up the Ladykillers is an all-star cast consisting of the likes of Alec Guinness and a young Peter Sellers, who shows his incredible talent for comedy early on in his career. Each of the five criminals is given a unique personality and they universally convince as thieves with a more or less rotten heart, depending on the character. The dialogue is witty but natural, the old lady's antics hilarious, and the slapstick excellently choreographed. Mackendrick's use of the claustrophobic set creates a strange atmosphere, mixing the light humour with some dark undertones. The set is like out of a bad dream, complete with strange colour contrasts, awkward angles and narrow, suffocating hallways. It's such a peculiar house where everything takes place and allows to be constantly interesting visually, despite the relatively small space.

The Ladykillers is really hard to fault in any area, as it is consistently funny, occasionally spiced up with rather dark themes without losing its sweet charm. Highly recommended.

No spoilers below! :)

Alrighty, I'm super late on this one, I know. And after actually sitting down to watch this movie my husband and I were deeply depressed we didn't get to experience this movie in the theater. 

I remember all the hype about it when Django first came out, and even though we both like Tarantino movies it just wasn't on our list. I'm not sure what was keeping me back. I'm not a Western fan, and a lot of 'action' in trailers doesn't excite me the way it should. I'm more of a comedy/horror fan.

Django Unchained was honestly *amazing*. There is nothing bad I have to say about it. I was entertained from the opening credits to the end. This movie was clever and fast-paced, but it lingered in all the right places. The characters are pretty unforgettable and I even love the ones I hate.

This movie has really shocking and touching moments, and some truly hilarious bits that happened at unexpected times. The dialogue is so believable and the cast is *fantastic*!

I enjoyed it.  Lots of action (car chases in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd acts, rather than the previous series staple of ""2nd act is boring because we save all of our car chases for the beginning and end).  A decent plot that ties this latest film to the events of the previous films (leads from Brian's cop past, ""The Rock""'s character from Brazil, and an explanation for some of the still-unresolved questions from Fast 4, all make an appearance).  The post-ending (not really post-credits) scene is very nice.  There are some flaws in the in-movie logic, and as seems to be par for the course with this franchise, the main villain isn't really a good villain.

As a stand alone movie, viewed from and objective point of view. It's pretty poor. The acting is ok, but the dialogue is awful. And with the remastering and tinkering it has lost the 70's charm it had.

Michael Mann’s romanticised historical epic may have been released in 1993 but it has all the hallmarks of classic matinee storytelling, with an unquestionably wholesome leading man attacked by foreign oppressors and guided by his virtuous heart. As the French and Indian war tears across North America in 1757, adopted Mohican Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his brother and father save a British colonel’s daughters from the hands of the French and the Huron tribe who fight alongside against the English. After witnessing the bloody injustices committed across the continent, and with a growing affection for one of the rescued girls, Cora (Madeleine Stowe), Hawkeye and his family are drawn deeper into the conflict.

Refreshingly uncomplicated and hugely entertaining throughout, this offers the simple thrills and pure escapism expected of big Hollywood cinema. The pounding emotive orchestral score, which leaves little chance of misreading a character or their motivations, rises and falls beautifully lending a warm nostalgic feeling. The music is almost as monumental as the performances. There is nothing subtle about this film: big emotions playing out in even bigger landscapes. Undeniably inflated and overblown, this is the very secret of the film's success. From the first reel it's a black and white tale of heroes and villains, and the power of pure hearts to conquer all. Never attempting to be anything darker or more complex, it chooses sentimentality over historical accuracy and is all the better for it. This is the kind of film that can be relaxed into. We all know where we’re generally heading - sit back and enjoy the spectacle.

Although predictable, ‘Mohicans’ is still engrossing thanks partly to several breathtaking battle scenes that don’t shy away from the bloodletting. Gunsmoke and flying tomahawks fill the screen as both sides clash in the forests and plains of the Hudson River Valley – the archaic weapons and setting lending far more danger and brutal enjoyment than their contemporary counterparts. Vicious violence plays in parallel with the swelling pure romance between Hawkeye and Cora, a relationship it’s easy to root for in the face of the adversities and cruelties they endure. Day-Lewis makes use of his considerable screen presence to bring more weight to the character of Hawkeye than perhaps is present in the script, a real ‘leading man’ performance in the oldest traditions of Hollywood.

Essentially a well-executed melodrama with some added bloodshed and a rousing musical score, only the stoniest of hearts will fail to be stirred by this. Back to basics filmmaking that proves straightforward stories produced with passion will always be valid, no matter how tastes change.

Generic motor-racing blockbuster from Tony Scott about the exceptionally named Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise), a rookie headstrong racing driver who is recruited to drive for Tim Daland’s (Randy Quaid) newly created NASCAR team. Daland lures disgraced former crew chief and mechanic Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) out of retirement for one more shot at the big time and to impart his knowledge to Cole. After a dreadful start to the season, Cole begins to grow in confidence and develops a fierce rivalry with reigning champion Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), crossing paths off and on the track. Falling for his beautiful nurse Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), haunted by personal demons and consumed by the need to win, Cole struggles to keep his focus on driving.

As simplistic as the title and synopsis suggests, this is a box ticking exercise in constructing a sports drama – with all the fast cars, guitar solos and adopted father figures you’d imagine. Not necessarily a problem: the predictable journey still holds plenty of enjoyment. 

NASCAR is a fairly tedious sport consisting entirely of stock cars lapping an oval circuit for little short of eternity – so it’s credit to Tony Scott that the race scenes are thrilling and far more gripping than the sport itself. Presenting an idealised vision of motor sport, the film resembles a collage of 80’s blockbusters – pink sunsets, sun-bleached racetracks and outrageously frizzy hair; for viewers of a certain age it's a comforting experience that is forever locked in a moment in time (when Tom Cruise wasn’t nuts). Utterly soulless and brutally deliberate, it plays out like a patchwork of what ‘needs’ to happen in an underdog flick. Unfortunately, a collection of all the right components doesn’t guarantee a well-constructed piece of storytelling and ‘Days of Thunder’ disjointedly chops around from one scene to the next. 

Tom Cruise adds a touch of star quality but when the script is 50% “goddammit!” and “sonofabitch!” there isn’t really much to be done with the role. But it’s through its cliches and familiarity that the film provides its pleasures – far from groaning at borrowed scenes and stilted dialogue they are so broadly signposted and deliberate you feel like doing a little Tim Henman fist-pump as it works its way through them. Claiming a film is ‘so bad it’s good’ is a huge copout that does a disservice to many pictures – there are positives in every film, and if they are enjoyable enough to outweigh the negatives then surely it can be judged as a success. Defiantly unoriginal and brash, this one is solid lazy fun that is better than most of the other has-been blockbusters you’ll find on late night TV.

★★★☆☆

I'm a fan of ""Family Guy,"" so I figured I would like Ted as well.

McFarlane's ""I Grew Up in the 80s!"" trademark is pretty prevalent throughout the movie, even moreso than in Family Guy, I would say. The humor (and, hell, music) remind me of the program.

I think the movie relied a little too heavily on whatever humor is derived from the Boston-area accent; it seemed forced at times.

Wahlberg acquitted himself pretty well in the main role, with its comedic oddity being a departure from his typical fare. The supporting cast and cameos were fun (with Ribisi playing a perfect creepster). And, of course, Patrick Stewart makes an ideal narrator.

The humor was enjoyable but, in my opinion, there was nothing outrageously funny or new/refreshing. It's a great movie to watch with friends.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1bu42r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1bu42r/ijw_ted_2012/,

Despite my dislike for Korine's previous movies, I did feel he had potential. He had some interesting ideas with stories, but one thing or another just ruined the final product. Sometimes it was his camera work, sometimes it was his characters, but his movies always came off to me as even less than half baked. But Spring Breakers nailed everything on the head. It's a fascinatingly trippy movie, that has a lot more substance than just being weird for the sake of being weird.

Korine seems to have a lot to say about this odd tradition we have called ""Spring Break."" For many, it's there last chance at being a crazy youth, before reality comes crashing down on them. And it's fascinating to see this dawn on each of the girls as the movie progresses.

I don't particularly enjoy Keira Knightley (this is purely personal) and the reviews are pretty negative.

I really liked it.  There's a Japanese concept of *mono no aware* (sadness for the transience of things) - I became aware of that via [Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kik%C5%8D).  While SAFFTEOTW doesn't come anywhere near YKK it does have some of that gentle sadness for things gone.

It does feel perhaps a bit choppy, moving from weird scene to other weird scene, but that's okay.    And the last two scenes are a bit frustrating - would he really have done that?  Sure, tender, loving, blah blah blah, but not likely.  

So I'm a bit confused about why this movie got such universally low scores on reviews.  It's not a 55% movie, because 55% are lousy.

For example, a drop of ink in a bathtub of water will never be whole again; you can't put the smoke back in a lit cigarette; you can't separate the sauce from the mashed potatoes once you mix the two. In short, if you don't make a decision then the choices in front of you remain infinite and inexhaustible (NOTE: Technically not true, but I digress).

Overall, I don't know how I felt about this movie... I felt like for every step it took forward, it took four steps back. I definitely ""got"" it, and if I had to describe it to someone I would say it's mix between *Butterfly Effect* and *Memento* (thematically and aesthetically, not storywise) in that it was certainly easy to follow. The problem is that it felt like it was trying too hard in the editing department with all the images it was throwing at you. The soundtrack, which at first seemed like it was appropriate in some ways, felt overdone by the end of the film.

The actors' performances are certainly nothing to write home about, with the exception of Jared Leto and Sarah Polley. These two's story was the only one I was super invested in (along with Toby Regbo and Juno Temple's). That's all I really have to say about that.

I will say this about the film: the ending ""twist"" (it really isn't if you're paying attention... but the impact was nonetheless an ""Ahhhh"" moment) was good; I almost felt as if the reveal near the end saved the film for me - and in general, it did - but then the ""Big Crunch"" killed it for me again.

I certainly recommend this film, mostly because I feel like it's not as widely seen as it should be (It has a 7.8 on IMDB I think, and while I'm not one to be deterred by ratings...), if nothing else than to have something to discuss... and this is definitely worth discussing.

Originally posted (by me) here: http://www.zimbio.com/Zimbio+Film+Reviews/articles/BxTIoeLP31M/Lovelace+Turns+Porn+Star+Person

Linda Boreman aka Linda Lovelace basically had one trick that made her the star of the most profitable and popular porn movie of all time. And the objectified Deep Throat version of Linda Lovelace instantly and unnervingly subsumed the real person inside in a way nothing could have prepared her for.

Lovelace is the story of how she tried very hard, with uneven results, to rehumanize herself. It's not perfect. It's one-sided, and lacking the nuance of a really great picture, but Lovelace successfully jolts its audience into seeing its subject as a person. This is the film's greatest merit, and it's achieved through dogged monomania. Any subtleties in the story, like Linda Lovelace's real-life return to modeling or the complexities of the people around her, are sacrificed in the name of delivering one message: Linda Lovelace was a person. 

The central narrative conceit of Lovelace is that you get the story twice. The first time you get the glammed up version of events: the lights, the fans, Hugh Hefner embracing her on a red carpet. The second time you get the seedy underbelly: the husband/pimp who would beat her if she didn't do as she was told; the mafia insisting she do another movie; and a shadier side to Hefner. That second time through is a surprisingly effective emotional bitchslap. 

Yes you can feel the ham-handed symbolism in the structure (two sides to the coin, the story, the person). The whole thing hinges on the audience's willingness to take this journey twice. Fortunately Amanda Seyfried keeps it interesting even when the next plot point has been telegraphed from 20 miles away. 

Seyfried's not the only one keeping it interesting, either. Linda's husband and abuser, Chuck Traynor, is written as a sort of melodramatic caricature, but Peter Sarsgaard's special gift for playing creeps keeps the audience off balance. The supporting cast is one big exercise in stunt casting, but I can't help but love seeing Adam Brody as Linda's super nice-guy co-star; or Bobby Cannavale, who so expertly terrorized everyone in Boardwalk Empire last season, playing the mafia-connected porn producer. As Linda's mom, Sharon Stone ratchets up the tension in every scene she's in even if her character isn't given any room to grow. 

A lot of comparisons are going to be made between Lovelace and Boogie Nights mostly because they're both about porn and they're both set in the 1970s. But beyond those two superficial traits, they don't have much in common, and the comparisons don't flatter either movie. 

Lovelace does get you to see its subject at a person, even if some of the shading hasn't been filled in. To me that feels like an admirable accomplishment for such a lean movie, and I see its value most in piquing the audience's curiosity about the subject. It's a conversation-starter of a movie, and it feels like a conversation worth having.

Went into this one blind and bought it due to a recommendation from a couple of friends.
A great western movie with both Bale and Crowe fitting their roles brilliantly.  The movie had me drawn in all the way through and the intensity between the leads was really really good.  Both the picture and sound quality were great, with a couple scenes giving my system a very good workout (gunfights, ending scene etc).  
Also great performances by the supporting cast and also Logan Lerman as Bales son.

Once the movie finished I took a few moments to appreciate it, a sign that it was a worthy addition to my collection and will certainly be re-watched.  Always good to sit down and watch a movie you've never really looked into or even heard of, and be delighted with the viewing.

Living in South Korea has a few advantages.

I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it, except that my girlfriend was really hyped on the director's Hollywood debut. The logline:

""In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off most life on the planet, a class system evolves aboard the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe via a perpetual-motion engine.""

Like a lot of Korean cinema that garners interest in the West, the film is bleak, violent, and rarely stops for a comedic moment. It also moves fast, setting up the premise before the title credits even finish, and constantly pushes ahead with the plot as the characters move forward on the train.

Like director Joon-ho Bong's most famous film, 2003's *The Host*, the film follows a central cast of characters who comprise a sort of family, although in *Snowpiercer* they are not all blood relatives. They are backed by a seemingly endless supply of nameless supporters, who comprise the cannon fodder during action scenes. The large number of these individuals is part of Joon-ho's interest in portraying social issues through genre fiction. Although the main character and his supporters are the largest group on the train, they are also the lowest class, bullied by a police force owned by the first class passengers. 

The class struggle aspects of the film make it more than a simple thriller, and the deft direction and mise-en-scene keep the film interesting, if a bit predictable. While I was never bored during the film, it does elongate its scenes from time to time. There's no single part that could have been cut, but a bit of trimming here and there could have pared the film down a bit from its 125 minute runtime.

These are minor grievances for a film that combines two of the largest issues facing society - ecological collapse and classism - in a way that is thrilling and never preachy. All of the actor's turn in excellent performances of the caliber expected by the likes of Tilda Swindon, John Hurt, and Ed Harris, while Chris Evans handles himself well in a role much more serious than that of Cap 'Murica. 

While it isn't Oscar bait, *Snowpiercer* maintains an original voice behind its action-thriller facade, particularly when compared to earlier Korean-directed Hollywood films that were more iffy. Instad of succumbing to gratuitous explosions and one-dimensional characters, Joon-ho ensures the film remains memorable after viewing. That in itself is notable for a movie with so many axe fights.

So, I'd like to draw an analogy between The Hunger Games and Pacific Rim. Both ""draw upon"" / ""borrow"" / ""lift"" certain thematic elements that had recently surfaced in popular culture perhaps just short of a decade or two prior. 

Now, when I came in to see The Hunger Games, I was going to expect the worst. I was a long time fan of Battle Royale and I was disturbed by the apparent ""copied"" premise. Boy was I wrong. The Hunger Games was amazing and took a shared premise and turned it entirely into something different, novel, and interesting. 

Again, I was a BIG fan of NGE (1996) having saved up all my work money for the newest VHS sets at the time, and I was quietly impressed by the visuals at the beginning of Pacific Rim, but also mildly disturbed as unlike Hunger Games, Pacific Rim didn't do anything beyond lifting SOOO many thematic elements from NGE and christ, I think I saw the same designs from both SC and NGE. It was like someone  was in charge of copying NGE and grabbing the soundtrack to Starcraft and mashed them into one giant blob that doesn't do anything.


[The worst thing was, the movie was GREAT right up until Mako had her first ""breakdown"" at which point I was instantly reminded of one of the Evas gone Rogue episodes and thought they would just eject the EVA and let them deal with it on their own (this happened during an NGE episode when they were demonstrating one of the newer Eva designs and because of a malfunction they tried pulling the plug but it was self-powered, so no-go. I still dont uinderstand how they pulled the plug in Pacific Rim because they even said it was self-driven via Nuclear power.](/spoiler)

What the movie lacked was surprise and driving action based on an EMOTIONAL or DRAMATIC arc, not just action for action's sake. [They had the PERFECT opportunity to jettison the Gipsy Diver out of the base right as Mako was going to shoot off the plasma cannon inadvertenly as part of her and mental breakdown and then start the show on a totally unexpected note](/spoiler) 

Instead we are treated to a presentation as childish as Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3. 

ON a personal note, a few years after seeing NGE the first time, I romanticized the notion of a giant robot film that was driven by an emotional arc. It was to take place on the cornfields of Iowa, where the construction would begin (sort of a nod to Gunbuster, i.e. robots amongst giant fields of grain)... and then about 5 years later, Pacific Rim is announced. I was hopeful. I was so let down. Movie making fundamentals ruined.


Here are some identifiable *attempted* thematic elements that I noticed as either nods or lifts :

1. Gunbuster Noriko / Coach relationship between Mako and the commanding officer Idris Elba (the black guy). 
2. Interface Synchronization : NGE
3. Pilots in Giant Mecha doing virtual movement with choregraphed ""buster shot"" / rocket elbow, etc.... NGE / Gunbuster
4. Music : Starcraft 1 and 2 inspired marine-side music
5. series of Ambiguous but uniquely individualized monsters with specific behaviours and attacks: NGE 
6. Team Russia  / Team China / Team etc... Gunbuster


Anyways, I sat through the end credits hoping to see at least a ""Inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion"" .... nothing... sigh. The amount of work and technical prowess this movie had was even more sad because the story did not match the technicals. Story is the MOST important. Even in ""simple action"" flicks like Die Hard, action is preceeded by an emotional arc because we are ultimately watching a movie about people, and the drama within them.",,False,,t5_2rafo,1375152321.0,,,True,t3_1jaug9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1jaug9/ijw_pacific_rim_2013/,

The Hunt(Jagten) is a danish movie directed by Thomas Vinterberg starring Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Bo Larsen. A drama presenting a teacher who struggles to get back his son's custody but his life is slowly getting destroyed as a lie is spread among his relatives and friends.

I'd start by stating that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen and it instantly became one of my favorites. It has a beautiful yet devastating script with Mikkelsen giving a heart-breaking performance. Is one of those movies that will overwhelm you emotionally and leave you outraged at the same time.

I don't understand how this has no Oscar nominees, not that it really matters, but yet such a wonderful production with no recognition from the Academy seems a little unfair.

Hello all,
I saw that someone reviewed this a while ago, and gave it a passable score, so I thought I would provide a dissenting opinion (I hope that's okay). [Link to other IJW review](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1h54bz/ijw_white_house_down_2013/) so you don't have to search for it.

I went into this movie being an Emmerich fan (my dad and I have probably watched Independence day 15+ times together and my entire family loves to watch The Day After Tomorrow occasionally and I like most of his other films) and knowing exactly what I was getting into: an over the top action movie with an overt political message that ends happily. Boy did this deliver and then some.

So the movie starts out like it does in the trailer. Channing, war vet, works security for the Speaker of the House and goes in for an interview for the Secret Service to impress his estranged daughter, played by the girl from Moneyball, and generally get his life back on track. So part Rambo, part stereotypical divorcee, all around American. I loved it and the opening wasn't as boring as I expected and kept me interested as it switched perspectives and blatantly foreshadowed. Also, Maggie G. is looking summertime fine (second only to her role in Secretary). Everyone else fit their role and the acting was pretty good.

From here on out it's spoiler territory, so no more plot. The action is top notch and I caught myself smiling like an idiot in the theater at some scenes. The comedy worked too, and there were some generally funny moments, as well as a lot of tension, which was balanced nicely. There were about 4-5 twists in the movie, which I saw coming a mile away, but it didn't detract from the film. And I normally don't like kids in action movies, but the daughter's scenes were actually very enjoyable and added a lot to the progression of the movie. Also, almost everything gets blown up, which is nice.

I don't like to give movies an arbitrary number score because my 10 and your 10 are completely different, but I would give this an 8.5-9/10. It's a completely mindless summer action movie and I absolutely loved every minute of it. I would probably have to put it above Fast 6 as my favorite movie of the summer. Sometimes you just need some mindless entertainment.

Sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR: Absolutely mindless summer action movie, but I loved every single minute of it. 8.5-9/10 and I highly recommend you give it a watch.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1hzqzn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1hzqzn/ijw_white_house_down_2013/,

The film is based on the book Tell No One by Harlan Coben.

I think what makes this film great is that it doesn’t pigeonhole itself into one particular genre, instead it mixes a few.
Even so, it’s clearly a thriller, but not in the conventional sense, it’s set mainly during the day and lacks the constant gloomy, dark, rainy attributes.

To be honest it’s worth watching for the foot chase scene alone. Shot handheld, this scene really adds to the frantic sense of despair and places you right in the midst of the action.

Another thing that heightens this film is the brilliant soundtrack, I think all the tracks are perfectly chosen to go with the emotions of the scene.
Even during the chase scene, the music is not frenzied and all over the place, instead it’s simple and tender. It all comes together brilliantly.

The dialogue was entertaining at least, especially between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. However, the majority of it was mind-numbingly boring and unnecessary. I know it was painting the picture of what you'd think were a couple of regular guys, but I was very bored watching two people talk about cheeseburgers and quoting bible passages. 



As for the plot, was there one? I couldn't see one. There was a briefcase involved (which you only saw twice) that could have been the drive behind their violence, but I don't know. You didn't get to see what was in the briefcase, which was okay because it left you wondering what it was, but I still kind of wanted to see it. 




I don't see what is so good about it, the fact that Tarantino managed to tie a few short stories together? Wow, well done. I'd be impressed if these stories were interesting and gripping, but they really weren't. 



Anyway, I gave it 4/10 on IMDb. How it has an overall 9/10 and is the 4th all time film is beyond me at the moment. I'm not sure whether it was because my friends hyped it up for me (this can ruin films for me), or that it is actually a really overrated film, but I don't like it. I'll have to watch it again and see if it gets better.

*Trance* is a great film, but one which is hard to explain without spoiling. As a thriller, it is a film which demands your full attention; it will make you think and will possibly leave you with discussion-provoking questions at the end. While the film may not be perfect, it is definitely one you should make time to watch. *Trance* earns its classification mainly from the violence throughout - there are a few scenes which aren't for the faint-hearted.

**Story** - *A dreamy affair*

In a film about hypnosis and dreams, parallels are likely to be drawn to similar films such as *Inception*; unfortunately not having seen that (I'm a horrible human being, I know!), I can't particularly comment. *Trance* offers an intriguing and, at points, tense 100 minutes - although some suspension of disbelief may be required. The main cast and supporting actors all provide a solid performance in general despite some weaker moments in a few scenes.

**Music** - *Louder than a tranceclub*

Rick Smith, of Underworld fame, has engineered an amazing soundtrack which fits the pace of the film perfectly, with electronic beats thumping throughout the action sequences to heighten the thrill. And they are thumping - the music throughout the entirety of the film is very loud, to the extent that it makes some conversations almost incomprehensible.

**Editing/Special Effects** - *Hypnotising visuals*

Dream sequences are common, and the movement between them and real life are beautifully done, with seamless transitions adding to the mystery of the overarching story.

I found Seeking A Friend for the End of the World to be an incredibly charming movie, as one would expect of a flick featuring the talents of Steve Carrell and Kiera Knightley. The film was quite refreshing in that it didn't really spend too much time attempting to suspend the disbelief around the whole concept of the world ending, and carried on in a ""look, you're either with this all the way, or you might as well just turn it off now"" sort of way. It was also quite nice to have an end-of-the-world movie that doesn't concentrate on overly-muscular males attempting to subvert the universe's impending doom, while everyone else runs around disobeying laws left, right, and centre because the consequences won't matter. At the heart of it, this movie depicts what the everyman would do at the end of the world.

As the end of the world is quite a delicate matter, this movie isn't exactly a laugh-a-minute humourfest, but does well to be eloquently charming at just the right times, complimenting the down-to-earth nature of the movie as a whole.

In essence, if you like an alternative look at things, and you're a bit of a sucker for a sob-story, I recommend Seeking A Friend for the End of the World. Kiera Knightley and Steve Carrell work well together, even if some of the writing does let them down at points, but the film is rather beautiful nonetheless.

I had gotten this movie via Netflix mail about 2 weeks ago. It was one of the movies that sat on top my bookshelf unopened, gathering dust. I kept thinking, ""ehhh, not in the mood yet."" 

Finally, yesterday, my cable went out, my husband was watching playoff hockey, I couldn't get Netflix to stream and my dog was exhausted from playing earlier. There was nothing to do. So, I popped it in the xbox. 

I had read an interview with M. Fassbender in GQ about a year and a half ago. I think he's an incredibly talented actor (his David in Prometheus is just fantastic,) but in the interview, he struck me as a pompous theatre type that took himself way too seriously. The interviewer kept asking him about his giant dick, which is shown several times in the film (and not THAT giant) - so I suppose the pompousness is almost unavoidable at some point.

Basically, I was expecting a film worthy of all the praise it garnished him, and I was really let down. His performance is great, no doubt, but it wasn't enough to carry the film. 

Fassbender's Brandon is absolutely deplorable. The only driving force in his life is sex. Every emotion he pretends to feel is merely an attempt to have sex. Anger, sadness, and frustration are all the result of a lack of sex. The joy he feels....ah, well. There's the thing. He doesn't feel joy. Or happiness. Even the girl he seems to actually, possibly like - is simply an attempt to recreate a sex act he saw earlier, and wanted to engage in. He is a sad, depraved man, created by what we assume is a terrible childhood. And Fassbender pulls this all off brilliantly. 

The problems arise, however, when the story fails to become interesting. Mulligan's performance as Brandon's sister, Sissy, is lackluster, and while her character is more sympathetic than Brandon's - Mulligan's weak performance fails to help us feel that. 

The plot is moved along only by predictable turns, and even the ending, as dreary as it may be, feels obvious.

1367245915.0,13,self.Ijustwatched,1dc7uk,IJW: Iron Man 3 (2013),ben_smith_123,19,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1dc7uk/ijw_iron_man_3_2013/,"Spectacular, glossy blockbuster starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, the billionaire scientist and mechanically-suited superhero, Iron Man. Suffering with panic attacks stemming from the carnage of a previous extraterrestrial battle, he buries himself in his work, building endless Iron Man suit variants. As a result he becomes isolated from the one person who truly understands him, his girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). A ghost from his past, the suave biological scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) reappears and threatens their relationship further. Meanwhile America is under constant threat from mysterious terrorist The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), and in a show of bravado Tony picks a personal fight with him that almost costs him everything.

Much like Iron Man, the movie is slick and polished on the surface but with pathos and a fragile, troubled man at its heart - a metaphor that is laid on thick throughout. But the presence of a humanity behind the explosions and visual effects is what makes ‘Iron Man 3’ so successful. Sure, it’s a funny, knockabout, colourful romp loaded with action, but it has a soul. Also surprising is that, though following a core narrative thread, it splits off in unexpected tangents along the way. It would’ve worked as a simple A to B plot, but it’s invigorating to see a film of this magnitude try a little harder.

The film is directed and co-written by Shane Black – the scriptwriter behind Lethal Weapon 1-2 – who has a unique skill for throwaway wisecracks and buddy chemistry, and puts it to great effect here. Tony meets a variety of characters along the way, and they all play out as comic squabbling buddy relationships. Every line is well-formed and punchy, capturing something of a comic book’s tone, but most importantly they’re genuinely funny. This owes much to Downey Jr’s relaxed, delayed delivery – a man who was born for the role. He IS Tony Stark - cheeky quips, ego, troubled past and all – and turns in an immaculate performance as the billionaire with humour and swagger, but also touching flashes of humility as Tony stares into the abyss. The appeal of the Iron Man story is how we can relate to Tony: a super-rich genius, yes, but under the surface he’s just a man, thrown into a world of super-villains and catastrophe we would all struggle to comprehend. 

The visual effects are surely some of the best committed to screen, incredibly slick but executed with physicality and weight that provides an authenticity often lacking from special effects blockbusters – there’s never a distracting moment of doubt that the suits and gadgets aren’t real. Action and fight sequences are as thrilling and dramatic as any in the franchise, made all the more affecting through our attachment to Stark. Ultimately ‘Iron Man 3’ is the monumental poppy blockbuster it needs to be – but accomplished with passion and a refreshing emphasis on character.

Seriously, this movie is such a staggering piece of imagination I'm still reeling 24 hrs after. It's a dark satire that takes place in a sort of alternate reality where the government (Central Services) rules over every facet of life and technology is ubiquitous, albeit goofy and somewhat primitive seeming. The computers are all flat-screen which is surprising for a movie almost 30 years old.

The story follows a man named Sam Lowry; your average guy with an overbearing mother and no motivation to move up the career ladder of the state beurocracy. But all this changes when he meets the literal girl of his dreams (the film is cut up with dream sequences that depict Sam as an heroic figure trying to save this girl). We're taken through a world of beurocratic incompetence that's justified by the threat of 'terrorists' as Sam attempts to connect with this woman. The story is simple enough but Terry Gilliam's capacity to tell it and make it visually staggering are definitely proven with Brazil. It's not CG but the practical effects get the job done and provide some of the most interesting and original visuals I've ever seen. This film also seems to reward repeat viewings as little things that happen always have some sort of pay-off later on. Michael Palin (Monty Python) plays a spineless officer in charge of lobotomizing udesirables and Robert Di Niro plays a freelance HVAC specialist/badass. 

Engaging story, brilliant art design, still-relevent satire and definitely worth the almost two and half hr runtime.

Do not go in expecting to leave understanding what happened. Do not expect the movie to explain it to you. That isn't what Upstream Color is about.

Upstream Color is about the experience. It's a story about a woman who's infected with a parasite, but it's also a story about interconnectedness, about consciousness, about love.

The movie is near impossible to spoil. But the story is only a little bit of it. What makes the movie incredible is how, with almost no dialogue but amazingly beautiful shots, you feel the emotional drive behind it. You feel the paranoia of the two main characters figuring out what's happening, struggling with paranoia and melding memories. 
And when you leave, you have this sense that you've seen something important, even if you can't quite define what it is.

Certainly it will cause a divided response. Those who need to know, who can't stand ambiguity, who don't want to think about and puzzle over and talk about and pull at a film, save your money.

Dining in the restaurant nightly with his gang of cronies, hangers on and oppressed wife Georgina (Helen Mirren) he taunts the staff and customers and is generally loud and oafish – not missing an opportunity to cause a scene. One evening Georgina catches the eye of one of the regular diners, a quiet, bookish unnamed man (Alan Howard) – everything her husband is not – and they fall into a lusty corporeal affair right under Albert’s nose in the kitchens and bathrooms of the restaurant. Unable to tame their passion, they strive to avoid detection as a real love begins to grow between them.

A mere synopsis goes no way to describing the depth and ambition of this film. A study of tyranny and evil demonstrated in an unflinchingly brutal drama and presented in a wildly imaginative alternate reality, this is a unique, memorable experience. The theatrical design of the restaurant's kitchens and dining room is immediately striking. Vast ornate sets dripping with foodstuffs and elaborate details and bright complementary colours fill every frame like a living classical oil painting. Frequently shot with wide static camera angles and lit brightly from above, the cavernous sets have a strong feeling of the stage – heightened by the eccentric costumes (designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, no less) that fall somewhere between 70’s London, Elizabethan England and the distant future. It may sound incredibly superficial but writer/director Peter Greenaway has delivered enough weight to ensure the style doesn’t overawe the subject. Released in 1988 it can be read as a satire on Thatcher’s Britain, or a broader portrait of oppression and the power of evil – the interpretation is left to the audience. Predominantly playing as a domestic drama about lust and abuse, it is so well written and performed it can be enjoyed as such - the depth is there for those who wish to see it. 

Michael Gambon is electric as the bigoted, grotesque ‘Thief’. Belittling his customers and terrorising his diminutive wife, he stirs all the feelings of vitriol and hate the character deserves - a big dramatic performance dominating the screen and creating an unforgettable character in Mr. Spica. Helen Mirren’s Georgina, initially a far quieter performance, is no less impressive, making the remarkable transformation from meek wife to sexual, hard edged woman filled with carnal desire and hate. Both roles are delivered with such solid conviction and boldness it is impossible not to be captivated by their interplay.

The raw intensity and electrified feeling of a live performance is almost impossible to portray on the screen, but Peter Greenaway has come close with the blackly funny ‘The Cook...’. The surreal setting and peculiar cast of characters lends an unpredictability and sense of unease that locks the audience up in Le Hollandais with the customers, and leaves us yearning for some daylight and respite from Spica’s tyranny. A dark, bizarre and ferociously original piece of cinema – this will be entertaining and relevant for as long as brutality and injustice exist.

Lifelong friends Holden (Ben Affleck) and Banky (Jason Lee) produce a moderately successful comic together, and live a grungy bachelor life in New Jersey playing Sega and chasing girls. When the boys are introduced to a fellow comic writer, the easygoing, feisty Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), Holden is immediately attracted to her - but is devastated to discover she has a girlfriend. The pair develop a deep friendship, but Holden struggles to accept Alyssa’s sexuality and fights to contain his romantic feelings for her. This creates growing tension as Banky sees their work and friendship beginning to suffer.

Initially exhibiting the typical Smith bawdy self-reflecting style, a real sensitivity and depth creeps up over the picture. The balance of humour and drama is well-pitched with more than enough laughs that complement but don’t overwhelm its more sensitive side. By far the strongest aspect is Affleck and Lee’s chemistry – they feel every bit lifelong friends, trading the scathing insults and brutal honesty that only the closest friends are capable of. Jason Lee is on particularly fine form as the short-tempered, sardonic Banky, full of believable vitriol but also adeptly delivering moments of heartfelt sentiment.

The sharp script contains the wordy soul-searching and pop culture references you’d expect from Smith, but his voice is more toned down in this instance, allowing the characters a bit more room to breathe and develop. As a result Holden and Banky are thoroughly believable and sympathetic, creating authentic trauma as their friendship is pulled apart - a well-observed bromance from long before that was a standalone genre. The love story on the other hand doesn’t come off quite as well. The performances from Affleck and Adams are decent enough but they just lack a spark between them. A slightly odd couple, it’s occasionally hard to pick out what they actually see in each other – but the heart is a mysterious thing, and far more unexpected relationships than this bloom in real life. 

This is an alt teen film presented in a bright poppy gloss, capable of cutting close to the bone and containing some real concealed weight. Funny, intelligent, moving and accessible - everything a comedy-drama should be.

Enjoying a carefree bachelor lifestyle in New York City he avoids commitments and serious relationships, instead choosing to fool around with blonde temptress Julie (Cameron Diaz)……. until the beautiful, wholesome Sofia (Penélope Cruz) enters his life, triggering a chain of events that leave David experiencing vivid dreams he can’t distinguish from his reality. This is told in tandem with a future narrative where David, incarcerated and with his face disfigured and hidden behind an eerie minimal latex mask, recounts his earlier life to psychiatrist Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell). These realities are intercut as we share in David’s tireless pursuit of the truth.

This is a promising setup that offers plenty of enjoyment, though not without flaws. A piece of pure Hollywood melodrama, it’s unrelentingly schmaltzy for large periods and chooses to shun several opportunities to dig into darker territory, instead glimpsing them briefly before moving on. That being said, it deserves commendation for bringing some of its concepts and structure to a mainstream audience. Blacker than the title and marketing would suggest, it does have the ability to shock and surprise. Unfortunately the layer of polish is so thick it’s often hard to see what is going on beneath the surface – as a result it often feels like very little.

Films are more entertaining when you know less about them, and 'Vanilla Sky' is a classic example - a fairly shallow experience that garners its pleasure from the twists and turns of the plot. The characters and direction are passable, but fail to conjure up the pathos intended. Switching back and forth between time periods David‘s story is slowly unravelled and pieced together – slowly being the operative word. It takes an eternity to kick into gear and doesn’t really hit its stride until the second hour - a shame because from then on it’s far more pacy and compelling. The initial stages are intended to develop our empathy for David, but it’s all painted with such broad strokes and sentimentality that they offer very little. Later scenes that deserve to be gut-wrenching are nothing of the sort. Tom Cruise is on top form as the laid-back millionaire tinged with mania and inner sadness (not a stretch for him) and does a fine job holding the film up during its meandering dull sections. Few actors have the presence or charm to keep you on side when a film is seemingly going nowhere, and despite his critics Cruise has that indefinable star quality that draws the eye. 

‘Vanilla Sky’ is a little too flabby and self-aware. On the whole it’s well handled (including a few truly memorable scenes) and is a gratifying, unusual experience – but several vast leaps of faith are required along the way.

Because I love movies, and talking about them. 

So first off a word of warning. The very first time I saw this film was in IMAX 3D. It was the 48fps cut. I'm sure most movie goers know about this. The 48 hertz (or whatever it is really called) creates a *very* smooth transition between frames. This creates that fake set look. The thing is, after some research, I found that 80% of the scenes are filmed on location in natural setting. **NOt** constructed sets. In fact, the only sets that were constructed were ones that are inside (I learned this from watching the video documentary). As I have said in previous reviews, movies that belong in a franchise have to accomplish several things: they must adequately add to the franchise, must be able to stand on its own feet, and it must connect to a deeper meaning. Blah Blah Blah it needs to be accurate to the novel, which this movie picks and chooses when it wants to rather well. 

* Obviously it connects very well to the the rest of the franchise extremely well. With most of the original cast (that are relevant in this film) returning, and crew included. The style of beautiful helicopter shots and walking continues. In addition, this movie attempts to foreshadow the coming evil of the LOTR trilogy. I thought this seemed a little necessary and adds to an already lengthy film. But more on that later.

* As a standalone film I think it is quite good. Cinematography is just beautiful. Score is wonderful. Characters are lovable. I scoff at people when they try to tell me the golden age of films has long since passed. I argue that since the medium was so new back then we over looked flaws in script, acting, make up, cinematography. Now we hold all of these to such high standards. it is rare to see a film succeed in so many, however. The hobbit does that. With some of the best written and performed scenes I have seen in recent cinema (I'm looking at you riddles in the dark). Amazing performances by Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen lift this movie to more than just great.

* As a book movie. I enjoyed it. I don't need to see an extra hour about Bilbo and company stopping in the woods talking to Beorn. Who can turn into a bear. I thought they were faithful to the scenes that truly mattered. This movie is long as is. VERY LONG. They made cuts, and they added things that they thought would be necessary to be able to pump 3 movies out (yes 3, check IMDB)

* On a deeper level.This film is about your home. And what you will do for it. it's about empathy. feeling for other people and fighting for them. I didn't really buy into all of the spiritual things people try to make the LOTR about. Especially the Hobbit. It is a story about human weakness, and how the people we overlook can be strongest of all of us. Which I guess can be related to spiritual stories but only on a limb.

**'Based on the true childhood experiences of Noah Baumbach and his brother, The Squid and the Whale tells the touching story of two young boys dealing with their parents' divorce in Brooklyn in the 1980s.'**

This is an interesting if not quite uncomfortable film for probably most to watch (or maybe it's because I'm a girl, and there are icky boy things). The father is a writer; an intellectual arsehole (he really is quite unlikeable), the kids must be nothing short of perfect, and whilst the kids are happy enough to try to please him while the marriage is still working, I think they start to see the error of his ways once they're forced to spend time with him in his grotty, run down house and it's apparent that he doesn't give a shit about providing them with comfortable surroundings. 

The mother is far from perfect too, although her flaws seem to be displayed in a more positive light, rather, she comes off in a more positive light (which is easy to do give the arsehole husband). But she does not miss out on incurring their wrath either, especially from her eldest son.

The kids act up by various methods (and to any of you who have boys, I wish you luck in their teenage years), including running away and masturbating amongst the library books and wiping the remains all over them. I leave you to find out what other delights they get up to by watching it. 

It's a good film, good acting from pretty much everyone, but it made me feel a bit edgy and I kept thinking of those I know of who have been through messy divorces, and how the film was probably a billionth of an insight into what they might've gone through. I guess it's just a subject that makes me feel slightly uncomfortable. I felt a little bit as though I was a fly on the wall, witnessing first-hand a couple's awful marriage breakdown.

I had in one hand my standard, campy, b-horror flick that I usually enjoy more than I should, but I picked this one up as I told myself ""Hey, maybe it's time to watch a feel-good movie for a change""

I wasn't exactly expecting this movie to make me feel warm and fluffy like ""Garden State"" did, but let me tell you, this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end credits start rolling. In a nutshell, an angsty 16 or 17 year old parades around his school with a video camera, casually suggesting that he's going to kill himself in his next movie project for class. While this might already put some people off, I highly recommend sticking to it. This movie is hilarious at times, and more than a few times I caught myself saying ""nice Archie, nice"". The main character is addicting, and plays his role chillingly realistically. I think that's what my biggest commendation to this film is-It's so easy to relate to. We've all been teenagers who are angry at everything in the world, but anybody can appreciate the realistic take on this average kid who just DOESN'T CARE. Before this turns into a synopsis of the movie, I just really want to get the point across that if you pass by this film at the video store, on netflix, on pay per view, or what have you, I HIGHLY recommend seeing this. It's not every day a movie broadens my views on life as much as this one did. Granted, some of the more over-zealous ""movie buffs"" as they like to call themselves will throw out some of their go-to words like ""pretentious"" to describe this, but Archie isn't pretentious at all, simply because Archie doesn't care. Every scene in this movie is gold, be it his encounter with his Middle-Eastern therapist, or even the scene in the gym, which hit very close to home for me.

TL;DR Watch this movie. You won't regret it. The soundtrack is great, the cast is great, and even though the ending might make you huff and puff, you'll walk away thinking about this movie for the next few days, just because it was THAT damn good.

Never recieved real promotion when released only in a few cinemas, but apparently became much better known when released on DVD.

*Plot*: During the Soviet-Afghan war, a Russian T-55 tank gets lost after a raid. Chased by Afghan rebels and with a crew struggling with each other, the conflict and the nature of war are boiled down to a small scale.

*I love it!* First of all, I'm a tank nut. I love tanks, and this seems to be the only movie ever made that seriously revolves around a tank, and it does so in highly realistical fashion. The military advisor did a magnificent job. Second, the movie is very good. Apparently derived from a theater play it knows how to tell a story well without much diversion, and how to include the necessary violence without judgement or celebration. It develops an extremely clear yet thrilling atmosphere. George Dzundza as the mad tank commander acted incredibly well!


Finally I recommend viewing it to understand the current Afghan war. It's a whole different conflict, but experiencing the atmosphere of the first one tells a lot about how the Afghans must think these days. However note that there are two different versions: Only one includes subtitles for what the Afghans say! Both deliver quite different feelings this way.

I feel like shit needless to say. I think it's pretty common knowledge about the main artistic expression of this film, but I got a little twist on what I already knew about it.
Throughout the film, the main man, this sort of moderator or master of ceremonies, made little 4th wall-breaking quips about how the audience wants excitement and violence and graphic nature. With these cheeky comments towards me, he made me feel like I was just an tasteless animal watching gladiators fight to the death. A lot of people attribute the theme of desensitization to violence in film to these moments, but to me it was the parts where they weren't there. 

The violence comes out of the blue and strikes you at random moments. It's truly jarring and chillingly executed in a nonshalant fashion. Very unromantic, just like reality. What hit me the hardest was [spoiler](/s ""after the son had been shot and they left the room."") The silence and stillness of the shock left me feeling ill. I felt it's like a very intentional, bitter silence as if the director is saying, ""You wanted excitement and violence. Well here you go. Now sit through utter silence, the stillness that made you yearn for violence, and think about what you've done."" It really hit me hard and made me feel ashamed. It realizes true violence and doesn't just *show* you the consequences. It makes you *feel* the consequences. The acting helped convey all of this very well.

What an exhilarating ride. The action was intense and I had an elevated heart beat for 30-45 minutes straight. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau was nothing short of terrifying and considering he makes me snail trail as Jamie Lannister, this was an odd combination of competing emotions.  

I was not at all expecting Lotte to be in on the plot to infiltrate the agency where Clas is attempting to get a job. The film does a good job of leading the viewer to believe that Roger's wife is a cold-blooded co-conspirator nearly until the end. The scene where she brushes his hair in the garage with her hands startled me immensely. 

The film also manages to portray a realistic and honest glimpse into romantic relationships in a 3 minute scene, with the integrity that Hollywood movies strive to achieve in ever 2.5 hour rom-com. When Roger and his wife come clean with each other, the atmosphere is both endearing, tender and raw. 

I would have loved to be a fly on the wall in the room when the script was being fleshed out. The amount of detail, the camera work accents, the lingering shots keeping you in suspense - this film is immensely well put together. As it winded down I was ready to protest with ""WHAT ABOUT OVE? He died days before Clas! Give me a medal for finding a plot hole!!"" only to have my ass handed to me when that issue wasn't just addressed, but echoed an essential sentiment discussed early in the film so beautifully. 

Overall, I am highly impressed. I loved this film, I will likely watch it again and I intend to tell everyone and anyone about it. 

As a side note, good foreign films always make me wish that I spoke every (at least major) language on Earth as so much is lost in translation. Being able to speak language other than English I see this ALL THE TIME and I can only guess how much I am missing with idioms, word play and other language specific detail being translated crudely or not at all.

Robin Williams stars as Lance Clayton, a struggling writer who doubles as a poetry professor at a generic American high school.  His son, Kyle, is a unpopular, sexually deviant 4chan lurker (presumably) who attends the school Lance teaches at.  When his son accidentally *SPOILER* kills himself in a style reminiscent of David Carradine, Lance convinces the world that his son was actually a literary genius by writing a fake suicide note, and beyond that, an entire fake journal which becomes a successful book.  Lance is then thrust into the world of the mainstream appreciation of his ""son's work"", where everyone wants to hop on the ""We Heart Kyle"" bandwagon and grab their 15 minutes of fame.  

What follows is a terrifically dark satire about American values and mob mentality, not to mention the ""behind the scenes"" of what it takes to become a successful nonfiction writer (many parts had me remembering the Million Little Pieces fiasco).  After seeing this film and God Bless America, I have a pretty good understanding of what Bobcat Goldthwait thinks about the world, and he is dead on in this film even more so than his most recent one.  

Anyone who has ever seen fake high school enthusiasm over a dead student will be silently enraged by a lot of the characters in this film, but in a good way.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_t0alv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/t0alv/ijw_worlds_greatest_dad_2009/,

I saw it in theaters as a kid in 1977, the film holds up really well. Spielberg had just made Jaws and clearly he wanted to do something different. With the success of Jaws behind him he could make any film he wanted and the studio gave him “final cut” rights too. Its Spielberg at his most Speilbergian- meaning there is a rosy glow of sentimentality that goes a little too far. At the time I assumed it was Spielberg cynically manipulating emotions to produce box office dollars and I felt some of his films hit you over the head a bit too hard with the rosy sentimentality . In his later career I was happy to see him do films without the schmaltz. That said, Close Encounters was made the same year as Star Wars and these two films changed American culture, they returned science fiction to the Hollywood radar screen. The only Oscar awarded was for cinematography as Star Wars gobbled up the rest. The special effects hold up better than I imagined they would for a film made long before CGI and when Motion Control was a new thing. There are a few optical issues around the edges of effects shots but they are seamlessly part of the texture of the film in a way CGIs smooth mathematical perfection can never really get right. John Williams was a busy composer at the top of his form in 1976 apparently, the man could do no wrong. In the decade between 1974 and 1984 he wrote the score for The Towering Inferno, Jaws, Star Wars, Close Encounters, Superman, The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Return of the Jedi and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

required viewing for genital mutilation enthusiasts [in the hopes it would make them reconsider their stance on genitals].

and while i can see where people who watch this movie can take away a pro-misogyny message, i disagree, and sort of think it uses the topic or concept of violence against women to convey She's overall insanity/Antichristy-ness. it gives her a jumping point that the more rational He can argue against, even when He gives into She's more violent sexual tendencies. that being said, im not a woman, and do not have the point of view of a female watching this movie [not that all ladies are the same, or fellas for that matter].

its a pretty movie. its also a pretty creepy movie.

Going into this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. The premise seemed kind of cool so I decided to start watching. A huge strong point was the complete vagueness and mysteriousness of the mist. What is it? What other creatures did it contain? What is it capable of? This mysteriousness was intriguing for the first half, but sort of fell apart in the later part.

Another strong part was the characters. Not necessarily the actors, which, because they were ALL cheesy, made it more enjoyable. I really liked the personalities that each of them carried and held. The development could have and should have been stronger though. I can scarcely remember any of their names, but their personalities clearly (marksman glasses guy, religion batshit lady, innocent whimpering son, skeptical black dude, etc).

I never read the original book, so apart from the fact that there are nine circles of hell, I had no idea what the story was about or how close to the original story it is. It is, from some reviews I read, an adaptation of the game which is an adaptation of the book.

The movie was quite enjoyable and the fact that each circle has been given to a different animation studio makes it very interesting. Character art changes from circle to circle and I really thought it was a good way to translate the changes that happen between each circle, as if the characters themselves are evolving.

After the horse barrel roll in the first scene ([as depicted here](http://www.cheshirecatstudios.com/reviews/dantes-inferno-animated-epic/dantes-inferno-animated-epic-film-roman-do-a-barrel-roll-wtf.jpg)) the movie just gets better (especially animation-wise) up to a very well done climax (which is possibly the worst deus ex machina I've ever seen, but that's not the movie's fault).

The final couple minutes of the movie are the best few minutes of it all; the narration, Dante's removal of the stitched cross, awesome.

Resorting to bounty hunting, Kemp journeys into Colorado’s beautiful, yet dangerous landscape, pursuing the fugitive murderer, Ben Vandergroat (Robert Ryan) who is accompanied by his loyal girlfriend, Lena Patch (Janet Leigh). Along the way, Kemp attracts the aid of failed prospector, Jesse Tate (Millard Mitchell) and disreputable Union-solider, Roy Anderson (Ralph Meeker) who manage to help Kemp capture Vandergroat and Patch. Upon discovering the value of returning Vandergroat dead or alive to the proper authorities, Tate and Anderson look to stake a claim in the $5000 bounty. However, with the realization that fewer stakes means greater shares, suspicions intensify and tensions amongst the group members begin to drive the men apart. Distrust is only made worse by the scheming Vandergroat, whose devious grins and smooth-talking manipulation force the other members of the group to reconsider their allegiances, ultimately leading to disaster.

A story laced with greed and deception, Anthony Mann and Jimmy Stewart’s third collaboration in the western genre does not fall short of greatness. With terrific performances from all cast members, Mann is able to create an unstable group dynamic rampant with mistrust and paranoia between Stewart, Mitchell, and Meeker. Particularly noticeable is Robert Ryan, who maintains a calm and cool demeanor all-the-while delivering subtle, scheming facial expressions and calculated dialogue. Jimmy Stewart manages to steal the film, however, as he presents an unpredictable and doubtful character, cynical of the intentions of each of his acquaintances.

In addition to excellent performances, The Naked Spur’s cinematography is gorgeous and certainly memorable. Set against the Colorado landscape, Mann presents the often harsh and untamed American west with vivid colours and exciting shot composition. Between the craggy and imposing mountainsides, lush forests, or savage rapids, The Naked Spur highlights the American frontier in a very exciting way.

Perhaps not the best film to come out of the genre, The Naked Spur is still an exciting film housing great performances and awesome cinematography. For those who are unfamiliar with western films, this is certainly one to see.

*I Melt With You* tells the tale of four college friends reuniting for one of their birthdays at a getaway in Big Sur: Tim (Christian McKay), Ron (Jeremy Piven), Richard (Thomas Jane), and Jonathan (Rob Lowe).  The reunion quickly descends into maddening drinking and drug abuse and drinking and drug abuse and a little more drinking.  We slowly learn more about each character's individual mid-life crisis as the days crawl by and brief moments of real conversation occur between periods of chaos.  Without giving too much away, about halfway through the movie something happens that drastically alters the plot and tone of the film; something from the friends' past that most of them (except for Tim) haven't thought about in ages.  Shit spirals downward from here until the end of the film, but in a very compelling way.

The cinematography was breathtaking in this film, for sure.  It doesn't hurt to have a beautiful place like Big Sur to shoot, but still.  Very vivid, very colorful.  Even inside their party house, where a majority of the film takes place, the lighting is very carefully thought out for individual scenes.  I would say this is one of the film's strongest suits.

The editing is a little chaotic at times and might make you uncomfortable or dizzy or sick, but it's all intended.  This film deals with a lot of mental strain, and I think there are some sequences that visually represent that perfectly.

The sound mixing is slightly off at certain points, in that a little bit of dialogue is muffled...which could simply be a Netflix error.  Who knows.  It was hardly enough to detract from the experience for me.

Great acting all around, though I must say I was a bit distracted at first because Christian McKay looked a lot like Tim Heidecker and his character was also named Tim, but that faded quickly.  I was impressed with every actor, but I think Thomas Jane was the stand out.  His character was the most wild, anyway, so it couldn't be helped, I suppose.  This movie probably didn't need to feature Sasha Grey, but at least she only played a thinly veiled version of herself.  Seriously, though, can she stop being in things where she isn't just getting fucked?  (If you haven't seen it, don't be too put off by this.  She's barely in it.  Just wanted to comment.)

The soundtrack was spot on and mirrored the themes of the plot perfectly.  There are some times when the music is wayyy louder than the dialogue, so be prepared to turn it down at certain points if you have complain-y neighbors.

Have I rambled enough?  I'll end by saying that *I Melt With You* is **definitely** not for everyone, as evidenced by the polarizing reviews on Netflix (I'd say ignore most of the bad ones, a good portion of them admit to not even watching the whole thing).  It's a trip and will make you think about a lot of things.  The main themes of the film are the bliss of youth and the tragic marching on of time.  Who you were versus who you are now, etc.  One of the recurring ideas is that it's impossible to recapture the past, and that, in essence, is responsible for the drastic change in plot in Act 2.

I would recommend this to people who like dark films that are intellectually challenging.  Also, fans of Entourage, because three people from it happen to be in this movie, too.

Just kidding, Entourage sucks.

I went into this movie thinking it would be incredibly cheesy, but a fun family movie. It was far better than expected. The biggest strength about this movie that I immediately noticed was how unbelievably realistic the tense family encounters were. Steve Carrell plays a very believable jerk step-dad, with lines and actions reminiscent of a younger me watching my friend's angry dads yelling at them for nonsense that always related back to self esteem issues. The water park scenes were admittedly quite cheesy, but Sam Rockwell has funny enough lines to combat the abundance of sunshine unicorn feelings. Overall, the reality of this movie is so prevalent, the anger from the children so relatable, and the dark comedy so well delivered that it makes for a pretty darn good movie (and overcomes the foreseen cheesiness)

Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds in a mediocre summer flick that resembles what would happen if Ghostbusters were poorly made into a buddy cop comedy.

Gritty crime sequel about the dirty deals and corruption that plague Rio de Janeiro – from the shanty towns to high office. Roberto Nascimento (Wagner Moura), leader of the city’s military police taskforce BOPE, finds himself waging a war against the very system he works in - attempting to eradicate criminals from the streets, and from his own force. Recently divorced, his wife and son now live with her new partner Fraga (Irandhir Santos), an outspoken liberal who frequently criticises BOPE and police violence in the media. Feeling he’s losing his son to a pacifist, and the system to ingrained profiteering, Nascimento is determined to set everything straight.

Unlike Nascimento and BOPE, ‘The Enemy Within’ lacks any real focus, unclear what it wants to be both ethically and tonally. His story is the main thread – narrating almost every scene – but the film continually splits off to follow other characters and their involvement in the scandals and criminality. It flits indecisively between several sub-genres from political thriller to action flick via family drama and gangster movie; as a result of this attempt to cram so much in, the end result feels a little shallow. It suffers similar indecision with its morals, admonishing police brutality, while equally stylising and revelling in it – an emotional conflict that Nascimento is himself suffering, but that doesn’t make it any easier to engage with. The spectacle of the violence itself is impressively brash and gritty, but the toneless moralising proves distracting – not eloquent enough to invoke scrutiny.

It clearly overreaches intellectually, but the experience is delivered with such macho energy and pace it is still able to enthral. The cast of bitter, dislikable characters are all enjoyable to watch, providing several breathtaking memorable moments. However that is all they are - moments. Characters are so lightly sketched that even Nascimento doesn’t develop discernible emotional engagement. This doesn’t necessarily hamper it as an action flick, but as it aspires to something deeper it has to be considered a shortcoming. Revisiting the documentary-style realism of the first film, it does feel a little cleaner with a more mainstream gloss and a brighter colour palette. In keeping with the idea that sequels should be ‘bigger and better’, it takes the small centralised idea of the first film and attempts to make it more epic and accessible. It still looks fantastically gritty and authentic, utilising a restless energy that doesn’t allow for a moment's boredom, but the long hinted at emotional punch fails to arrive.

Individually everything is well-handled, but without the clarity of an overall vision this film lacks any killer impact. As the end credits roll you just feel you’ve watched a bunch of ‘stuff’ that happened. A thoroughly enjoyable but unfulfilling ride through an amoral, violent world.

Jay Baruchel makes the trip to LA to hang out with his old friend Seth Rogen. After playing video games and getting suitably stoned Seth persuades the reluctant Jay to go to an A-list party at James Franco’s house. It’s as awkward and nauseating as he fears, but as sudden earthquakes and stormy skies reduce the city to fire and brimstone he has no choice but to remain locked in the house with his fellow survivors: Rogen, Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson. With no one to look after the pampered stars they attempt to fend for themselves, but wind up bickering over Milky Ways and porn mags.

This is obviously a completely self-indulgent concept and an opportunity for a bunch of friends to laugh at each other's jokes – but by virtue of the sheer natural comedic ability of all the cast, sharing a house with them squabbling for 100 minutes provides more than enough laughs for this to rate as a success. It’s fairly bawdy, puerile stuff – the endless dick gags do become tiresome – but frequently more subtle lines and quiet deliveries prove more satisfying and add some balance. Never rolling-in-the-aisles hilarious, thanks to the incessant jokes it is constantly amusing and never begins to drag – an achievement considering the confined location and lack of momentum. Many of the biggest laughs come from a slew of cameos, with the demure Michael Cera playing a lecherous coke fiend being a particular highlight. Unfortunately Shelf Heroes’ favourite, Paul Rudd, is restricted to the briefest of walk-ons, which is almost unforgivable. 

The more conventional horror elements are surprisingly well-handled, delivering some decent scares and awesome gory B-movie effects. The genres aren’t as seamlessly melded as they might have been and feel a little tacked on, but as it’s ostensibly a knockabout bawdy comedy it’s hard to have too many complaints. ‘This Is the End’ isn’t the sharp satire of celebrity it thinks it is, and the actors probably had more fun than the audience will. Nonetheless it’s uplifting Saturday fun with a touch of bromance sweetness and more than enough laughs. If the thought of being locked up with Seth Rogen and Danny McBride didn’t appeal to you before, this will do absolutely nothing to change that.

This is an interesting documentary by Oliver Stone interviewing Fidel Castro. Stone was given three days access to interview Castro about anything he wanted. And in this you can see that at times he did. He asked about the Missile Crisis, the perceived thought of lack of elections in Cuba and Castro replied with honesty and at times passion.

While it is a documentary about Castro it can also be seen as a guide to Havana and a look in the life of one of the most important leaders of the 20th Century. The access given is amazing, you see Stone in the back of Castro's car with him and he finds his pistol in the back, I can't think of many leaders around the world who would allow this sort of closeness especially one who has had many attempts to kill him.

It is also moving in parts, you get to see Castro on a more personal level talking about his regrets, what he wished he had done, and what Cuba had done.

Fox as Frank Bannister, a real-life ghostbuster in the suburban town of Fairview. After suffering a near death experience Frank is left with an ability to view the spirit world that is all around us. Turning his gift into his trade, he befriends a couple of ghosts and gets them to haunt various inhabitants of the town, then shows up later posing as a ‘psychic investigator’ and removes them. As Frank is working on this con, a genuinely dangerous spectre operates in Fairview, methodically killing residents at will. Fighting to stop it he becomes tangled up in the mystery of a notorious serial killer, a psychotic FBI agent and the unexplained death of his wife several years earlier.

Michael J. Fox is always watchable and does solid work here as the affable Frank – bringing some humanity and warmth into what would otherwise be a fairly distant experience. The real stars of ‘The Frighteners’ though are its design and effects. Released in 1996 they haven’t aged a day thanks to a fairly lo-fi look. The human ghosts feel believably part of the scenes and capture an authentic pellucid physicality, and even uses of archaic CGI look surprisingly current and tangible. Jackson – renowned for his love of gruesome bloody effects – has found space to work in a few fantastic trademark touches of gory over-the-top special effects that are frequently more enjoyable than the narrative.

These elements have obviously been shown some real love and attention - and make the film worthwhile. Backed by a spooky, exaggerated score by Danny Elfman and some snappy direction it moves along quickly, with a continually eerie suburban mood. The script exhibits less attention than the visual elements so the narrative journey occasionally feels a little flat and uninvolving, almost like a ride on a ghost train at times, with fewer laughs (or scares) than there ought to be. A rollicking final third does much to make amends for this, and overall it’s good superficial fun throughout – not outstaying its welcome and conjuring up an impressively tactile stylised world. Amounting to less than the sum of its parts, the disposable 100 minutes provide sufficient small pleasures.

She comes to suspect this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives and becomes increasingly infatuated with him*

I’m not sure this is an accurate summary from IMDB, not only do I not I see Evelyn Stoker as particularly unstable (especially as she just lost her husband, and in fact held it together supremely well under the circumstances), but I also didn’t view India Stoker as infatuated with Charlie. She’s a normal 18 year old girl who is rightly curious about this stranger who suddenly settles down as a long-staying guest in her home. But hey, who writes these IMDB summaries anyway?
 
The first half of the film is slow moving and sets the scene, as is 
Chan-wook Park’s style. I did find my mind wandering, but that’s also true of three others of his I’ve seen. 
Unfortunately the first half also served as a reminder that not only is Kidman always cast in the same roles (an upper-class, attractive, flirty yet unapproachable lady, and again one that we can’t relate to nor grow to care about), but that I really do not like her acting. Matthew Goode’s acting is also a little wooden, although his is not particularly irksome. 

Mia Wasikowska, on the other hand: she saves the film. If not for her (and after having seen her give marvelous performances in [In Treatment]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835434/?ref_=sr_1)), I would probably have switched off, Park or no Park, and tried again another time, or in chunks. 

The second half of the film redeems it, and I even began to forget how much I dislike Kidman’s acting. We slowly begin to uncover some truths about Charlie, and I enjoyed the manner in which Park directs: yes, some of the surprises are a little clichéd and I was able to guess what was coming next in quite a few parts in the film, [for example, India masturbates, cue her suddenly wearing a silk negligee instead of her usual dowdy clothing, and her annual present of a pair of shoes from her uncle for her 18th birthday were a very predictable set of Jimmy Choos](/spoiler), but overall it made the film enjoyable enough to recommend watching it. There isn’t a huge amount of depth to the storyline but visually it is very pleasant and I especially enjoyed the ending (others may not), and the [soundtrack]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzaVZYg0Fdw) too.

This has been posted before, but that was a couple weeks ago. I'm not sure what the rule is for ""reposts,"" so if this is too soon and needs to be removed, I apologize and understand.

*tone: informative*

[IMDb link.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2184339/?ref_=sr_1)

**Basic synopsis:**

*tone: friendly musing, informative*

The Purge is a psychological thriller set in the near future, where crime, poverty, economic problems, and more are all essentially ""fixed"" due to a one-day-a-year event, called The Purge, where all crimes are legal for 12 hours. Emergency/police services are unavailable during this time, so it's an ""every man for himself"" vibe.

The plot follows the very well-off Sandin family, father and mother played by Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey, and their two teenage children. The night of the Purge, they lockdown their house with state-of-the-art security systems, bars, barricades, locks, and more, with surveillance equipment (audio and video) all over the place. It seems like they're going to have a quiet, uneventful night, when the violence comes to their usually-unbothered rich neighborhood. The son takes pity on a homeless black man who is terrified and fleeing a mob hunting him, and opens the gate long enough to let the man inside. The mob, which consists of rich, white, young adults who are clearly as insane as they are cold, creepy, and calculating, assure Mr. Sandin that if he doesn't release the ""homeless swine"" to them to complete their hunt, they will break into the house and kill everyone inside.

Of course they kill the electric power to the house (the security systems say in place due to a power generator backup), basically so the house will be dark and scarier for the audience. The first thriller aspects are the back and forth of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sandin trying to get all the family members together and safe, and finding and capturing the homeless man -- who absolutely is going to fight for his life. Then, of course, once the mob breaks in, it becomes a hunt between both sides (the Sandins vs. the mob) to kill the opposing side first.

**My review:**

*tone: thoughtful*

I have always been interested in the idea proposed in The Purge: would society actually change if we gave permissions such as these? Would allowing murder (along with many other horrific crimes) actually make things better, or would they encourage people's minds in that direction in general, causing us to become more corrupt? Can people differentiate between who they are almost all the time, and who they're ""allowed"" to be on one day a year?

This idea is by no means new. But The Purge was the first movie I've seen that incorporated some flavors of race and class into it. There is almost no unemployment or poverty because the middle and upper class citizens hunt and kill those who are unemployed, homeless, or living in poverty on the day of the Purge. While it wasn't directly stated, it was obviously very intentional that they had the homeless man be black, to underscore the racism that would inevitably occur when lower class people are the ones being hunted.

However... the idea, and its extremely complex nature, isn't much of what the movie is. Most of the movie is simply a thriller movie, with a decent amount of tension, violence, and some gore.

I wasn't expecting much from the movie -- such a layered, intriguing subject isn't best handled in a format that largely focuses on a barely-related plotline. But the movie itself was enjoyable as a somewhat over-the-top thriller. Most of it was brainless and borderline silly (sometimes outright silly), but still flashy and oddly fun. It awkwardly married a fascinating idea, a half-assed execution of said idea, and the brainless entertainment of a ""good"" bad movie.

I ended up enjoying it for what it was. By no means was it a smart movie. By no means was it a flawless movie. But it was fairly fun.

I would recommend it only if your expectations are low and your spirits reasonably high. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like psychological thrillers, perhaps give it a watch.

You could call it a father-son classic because the director was the great John Huston, and his dad Walter played one of the leads.  They both earned Academy Awards for this film -- the only time that father and son have scored Oscars for the same movie.

The story is a surprisingly gritty psychological drama dressed up as an adventure story.  Three gold prospectors seek their fortune in Mexico, but things fall apart when one of them (Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs) sinks into destructive paranoia.

I've seen it about a half-dozen times (never before in a theater though), and Bogie's uncomfortable antihero performance always keeps me interested.  You have to put up with a some of the mannerisms of 40's films -- *like unnaturally rapid-fire dialogue, see* -- and a cliched portrayal of Mexico as having a population about 50% *banditos*, 25% *federales*, and 25% peasants.  But it repays you with a good tale well told, touching lightly on themes of riches, altrusim, trust, and whether or not one should show any stinking [badges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinking_badges).

The ending is bleakly awesome, and TIL/realized Kubrick totally borrowed it for [his own blustery ending to The Killing (1956)](/spoiler).

On one hand it is a sure footed venture with Zack Snyder at its helm with Nolan and Goyer backing it up with the story.

When we normally think of **the** superhero movies, Batman comes to mind almost immediately. That is because those movies showed the *human* side of our superhero along with the 'super' part.    
Man of Steel was expected to be a rival to the Dark Knight trilogy but many had doubts over whether it would be able to hold up to it.

Well, fear no more. Man of Steel is a masterfully crafted superhero extravaganza. I have **never, ever** seen such action before. Zack Snyder is THE man.

The movie starts off pretty slow upto the hour mark on which we are metaphorically blind sided by the sudden turn of events. Believe me, I forgot to eat my nachos, the scenes were that good.

Batman sold me via the story and the acting, Superman sold me by the action, acting and scale.     
Talking about actors here, Henry did such a wonderful job as Kal El, he always looked calm and composed whenever he was faced with tough challenges, just as Superman should. He reminded me a bit of the Christopher Reeves era Superman.

Jonathan Kent, Jor El and General Zod held their own throughout the movie, I even liked the chick who accompanied Zod everywhere, her name was Fow Ra I think.


End of it all, a magnificent 9/10. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in years.

**Jaw Dropping, Action Filled, Fulfilling Movie**

Pros :

* Awesome cast

* Large Scale

* No expense spared on the CGI

Cons :

Rhoda (Brit Marling), a bright young woman obsessed with astronomy, has just been accepted into MIT. After drinking and celebrating with her friends she unwisely decides to drive home and becomes distracted by a radio broadcast about the discovery of a new planet remarkably like our own. While peering out the car window to get a glimpse of it in the night sky, she slams into a car containing acclaimed composer John Burroughs (William Mapother) and his family. Released from a young offenders institution 4 years later – still under the looming presence of ‘Earth 2’ – Rhoda attempts to restart her life and atone for her mistakes.

This is a lo-fi indie affair charged with an ever-present melancholy and running as a 90 minute riff on the idea, ""what would’ve happened if..."", a thought that haunts us all from time to time; in this alternate reality it is literally hanging over Rhoda in the form of the vast ‘Earth 2’. This physical representation of an internal thought is an interesting conceit that sits subtly with the human drama, and lends an added accessibility to Rhoda’s emotions – possibly too literally, but the film’s confidence and originality are enough to keep you on side.

Shot in a hazy dreamlike quality, we are left feeling as displaced as Rhoda and John, both coming to terms with their lives, deviated from their expected paths – the film washing over us in a blue tinted sombre haze, days and weeks merging together and passing by. It effectively creates a consistent solemn aura that lingers long after the credits. Narratively there are few surprises and, after some reveals in the first half, it plays out as expected, but it’s through character and ideas that ‘Another Earth’ is most satisfying. Communicating an abstract thought in an uncomplicated way is no mean feat, and this is where science-fiction comes into its own as a genre. Marling is exceptional as the lead producing a natural, heart-felt performance, sharing a compelling awkward chemistry with the equally adept Mapother.

Created with next to no budget, the film manages to look striking – decent visual effects conjure up the ever-present planet and Rhoda’s journey is captured with some exquisite, memorable cinematography. Not without flaws, the plot takes a few diversions that sit uneasily with the rest of the picture, and our sympathies with Rhoda are never as strong as they might be – but as a thoughtful study of an everyday idea, it’s an unqualified success articulated with originality and ambition.

**This entire post may contain a lot of spoilers. I wrote it with people who have seen it in mind.**

First and foremost, it blew my mind that the kid was Natalie Portman. I looked it up halfway through the movie because she seemed to look familiar and also to see how old she was (cause it started to get a bit creepy). The film recorded in 1994 makes me wonder, was it just as creepy back then as it is now? Maybe someone who saw it in that context can comment and let us know.

Either way Portman did an outstanding job portraying Matilda, I HATE child actors most of the time but she did a believable job. Especially that scene when she walked down that hallway to the door. Frightening.

I'm not sure what to think, it seemed deliberate that she had to be young. So young that it looked a bit weird to see her in skimpy outfits and a choke necklace. Was it to complete the illusion that Leon actually thought she was 18 as she said in the movie? Or possibly to establish something about her character. It seemed strange also that the camera focuses sometimes on these details (her sexualised image) then again it could be me just noticing these since it made me uncomfortable to see the relationship the way it was.

Gary Oldman was also great as being the creepy ass villain. The two scenes where he takes those pills and transforms into maniac sent chills down my spine. I'm glad they didn't overuse it as would've looked goofy the third or maybe fourth time around.

I can't say i really liked the character of Leon, or the way Jean Reno played him.

The movie was good, it was endearing at the end and the motif of roots and symbolism of the plant was easy enough to understand (and therefore easy enough to relate). I'm a strong proponent that symbolism, imagery or motifs should be easy enough to understand. Being too cryptic and clandestine about what you want to convey is just plain confusing and irritating. (Look up Melancholia).

Warm Bodies is a movie that was released in 2013.In terms of the genre the movie is a well-rounded mixture of comedy, romance and horror.I am usually very skeptical about romantic comedies as they very often turn out to be cheesy and involve a lot of cliches, this movie however makes the comedy part be subtle and not in your face which is much appreciated.

Small plot synopsis: Warm Bodies is a movie that entails a story of apocalypse from a somewhat underused point of view : from a POV of a zombie.The movie is about the struggles of being a zombie and the different thoughts and feelings that they have which is the most that can be said without spoiling the plot.

All in all I found the movie to be very charming and funny.While I usually don't appreciate romance in movies, I did in this one.A large part of the time during the movie I found myself having a large grin on my face.The acting is quite good and believable. Soundtrack is good as well.The twist for the common zombie apocalypse is pulled off very well.The only parts about which I would have some qualms are character depth and the lack of any well-etched message or motive to be taken away from it.

In a twisted world without child protection services and despicable parenting, Matilda is desperate to get revenge on everyone who has wronged her. Well, maybe the story is not that dark. ""Matilda"" is yet another movie based off a Roald Dahl children's book. It is a lighthearted book about a girl with a passion for books who is neglected by her parents and abused by her headmistress, Miss Trunchbull at school. The only person to truly recognize Matilda's special gifts is her teacher, Miss Honey. The film is a bit darker than the book but does a great job of capturing the story.

If there is one thing that the film succeeds at is that it completely captures how intolerable Matilda's parents and Miss Trunchbull are. The performances are rage-inducing and show how innocent Matilda is. The camera angles are dizzying at times, but give the film a surreal quality, making everything feel like an exaggeration. Every character is over-the-top, especially Miss Trunchbull who tosses a girl by her hair, nearly hits people with darts and even locks Matilda in the ""Chokey"", a closet surrounded in nails. At times it is easy to wonder how much further the torture could have gone if the primary audience was not children.

On the opposite side of the spectrum are Matilda and Miss Honey who are the only characters that provide hope. Hope that things can change and that something positive can happen in a truly negative world.

I really like cop movies, but they are all too often framed from the standpoint of corrupt cops. End of Watch really jumped out at me for the reason that its two leads are out only to do good. They are certainly mavericks in a sense, but they are mavericks in the service of justice. The movie did generate a some flak for its choice to intersperse handheld camera shots with more traditional filmmaking, but I felt for the most part it was an excellent choice. The calls that the two leads go on throughout the film are given a sense of immediacy and realism that I've never seen achieved outside of a reality show, and yet it still feels well crafted. Every call yields a tremendous amount of suspense because we as an audience are unsure of the dramatic violence that can happen at a moment's notice. It gives us a glimpse into the presence of mind of a police officer on a call; you have to be aware of your surroundings and constantly prepared for the worst. It is that sense of pacing which really made for a level of suspense I haven't felt in any movie that I have seen in recent memory. It also makes the violence, when it does come, all the more biting and furious. I've seen a lot of violent movies and have become a little numb to it, but I have to admit that I gasped several times during the film's more intense sequences.

I've always been on the fence about Jake Gyllenhal, and I am proud to say his performance in this film won my respect for him as an actor. He manages to deal with the worst that a life as a police officer can bring and yet manages to maintain his cool. You know that his character is tortured, and he conveys it brilliantly. Micheal Pena was a real surprise as his partner, given the fact that I am used to Pena playing bit parts in comedies. He carries the role of a lead brilliantly and manages to fuse a chemistry with Gyllenhal that feels profoundly genuine. You believe their relationship, which adds a tremendous amount of emotional weight to some of the film's heaviest moments. As someone who understands the needs of plot structure, I understand that a portion of the film needed to be devoted to the personal lives of the officers, but on the whole I felt that those were the weakest moments of the film. 

On the whole though, if you appreciate suspense and a well developed script (and don't mind your fair share of shaky cam filmmaking), End of Watch is in my opinion the most underrated film of 2012. Absolutely worth your time.  ",,False,,t5_2rafo,1370056826.0,,,True,t3_1fg1ul,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1fg1ul/ijw_end_of_watch_2012/,

Here’s a [YouTube link]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Dlzv9inoqk) - it opens straight out with talking but that is the actual beginning. 

This is a somewhat frightening watch. Strangely for me, I did not feel myself getting emotional about the characters Louis observed, I’m unsure why, but I wasn’t able to feel much pity. Which is strange, because some of them are in truly dire situations, and I’m an empathetic person. 

Louis follows a small handful of people around and talks about their meth addictions, when they started, about rehab, how it has affected family relationships and so on. There’s a lady who has to get off it because she’s not allowed her kids back, a couple who are so committed to one another that he won’t break the habit (despite being able to) because she just can’t ever wean herself off it, and then there’s a grandmother (or mother, I forget) in tears about an 18 year old boy. It’s all highly unpleasant really. 

The scariest aspect for me was the revelation of the cost for a hit. Only $20. Now, a binge drinker in the UK would spend three times that in a night probably, and we allegedly have a big problem with it over here if you believe the stats. So it’s extremely frightening to see that the problem is so widespread across the States, and I have since discovered a good friend who has two near best friends who are addicted. That’s just from one American I know… he had a string of random texts from one of them recently and they were far, far removed from anything slightly sane. Threats, tantrums, love you, hate you, you judge me, you’re the only one who does not judge me,  completely ineligible text in some parts, then insisting that life is GREAT right now (when he is feeding his habit). The other… well this is very sad. She’s gained a lot of weight. She’s at 350lbs now. Even when not on the habit she hallucinates. 

That’s two formerly good people ruined there. So, it’s usually a trend that what happens in the States eventually comes to our little island, it may take 10-20 years, but it always does come. And this terrifies me. This is not a habit you can easily break, you can’t put a patch on for 30 days and it’ll go away forever. It’s a seriously addictive habit and if you’re unfortunate enough to also have an addictive personality… well, you’re frankly screwed. 

I’m hoping that I’m proven wrong.  If I try to consider it logically, you have a LOT of space in the US for meth production labs, and the UK does not. We don’t have vast, vast plains of empty space for miles and miles on end, except for perhaps the Yorkshire Moors, but then a lot of people ramble (do long walks) across those. 

Breaking Bad suddenly seems a bit less entertaining now that I know a little more of the harsh reality of the drug :/

Does anyone have any thoughts on the subject?

What I got instead was a fascinating look into the psyche of the US military in a way few other films cover, here there are no heroes or villains, just men, each with their own flaws and strengths. This is based on the autobiography of one of the main characters and in my opinion gained weight due to that, in the same way *Band of Brothers* did.

I found that some scenes felt a bit too long and could have seen some cutting, though that said I can't think of what could be removed. Finally, I would like to point out Jamie Foxx's staff sergeant as a particularly good piece of acting.

Justin Lin's Tokyo Drift was up until now the only entry in the Fast and the Furious franchise I enjoyed and after the awful 4th film it seemed as if it was an accidental success and we were back to everything I loathed about the previous installments. Yet, despite the universal panning of the franchise in general it seems impossible to go anywhere without hearing that the 5th installment is actually rather good. Surprisingly, every positive thing to hear about Fast Five is completely right and then some as not only is it refreshingly different in that it is primarily a heist movie with cars rather than being about racing, it is also competently made in every regard. With the exception of some dodgy CGI here and there the frankly ludicrous action scenes are well-made, exciting and easy to follow. Justin Lin seems to have finally learnt how to shoot proper action scenes and thanks to a highly creative mind created some of the most fascinatingly stupid and entertaining action set pieces I've seen in a long time, especially from a blockbuster franchise like this.

Fast Five is big, dumb and loud, but rather than being annoying is filled to the brim with spirit and pure joy that - for grown-up children like me anyway - it becomes impossible not to embrace every second of its childishness. Briskly paced, this is the first in the series that has not a single section of boredom and with dialogue as ridiculous as the action scenes it put a smile on my face that never faded and at times broke out in laughter. The chemistry between the cast is the best of the series yet and although none of them will win an Oscar for their efforts, particularly Vin Diesel, whose expression seems to be stuck in place, they are serviceable and convincing in their stupidity. Snappy one-liners, an engaging storyline, competent direction and genuinely exciting action sequences that go from stupid to retarded - Fast Five sets the example for summer blockbusters and, I never thought I'd say this, is absolutely brilliant entertaining that I'm sure I'll revisit many times.

This movie is incredible. I was a huge Coen bros fan to begin with, but had never gotten around to viewing *Barton Fink* until this morning, when I had a whim to browse Netflix. 

Though it seems to fit multiple genres, I'd go as far as to categorize *Barton Fink* as a horror film. Maybe not in the sense that it fits within the conventions of the horror genre, but in the sense that it satisfies the most basic definition of horror: it conveys a constant sense of uneasiness, dread, and discomfort. The film is, from start to finish, extremely unnerving. The score, cinematography, acting, and attention to detail make this movie.

*Barton Fink* possesses many hallmarks of the Coen Brothers' trademark style: eccentric larger-than-life characters, sinister disturbingly friendly people, jarring violence, a historical setting, recurring actors, and impossible dreamlike sequences.

The story seemed a little too familiar to another movie that I won't name because it would almost be a spoiler its so similar.

I was not disappointed. It was punchy, exciting, entertaining and it looked so very good. As an actual fan of TRON: Legacy I can only say Kosinski is getting better.

Tom Cruise was very good, as was Morgan Freeman. I think the best probably was Andrea Riseborough's character, she was the most interesting as the plot unfolded.

The plot's a little sticky in parts but I understood it all and why things happened the way they did.

After bedding the wrong woman he flees the travelling circus pursued by a furious husband – and strongman – and makes his escape in a handy hot air ballon, only to be caught in a tornado that propels him to Oz, a surreal magical land filled with giant flowers, talking monkeys and yellowing paving. The inhabitants immediately believe him to be the prophesied wizard who bears the name of the land and will save them from the threat of the wicked witch. Oz scoffs at the notion – until his eyes light up at the vast riches and place on the throne of the emerald city that await him if he can defeat her. With the guidance of witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis) &amp; Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and a friendly flying monkey in a bellhop’s uniform (Zach Braff), he apprehensively sets off on his quest.

‘Oz’ has all the baggage of the 1939 classic to carry and feels restricted because of it, but it is nevertheless a fun, standalone family romp. Franco’s peculiar laid-back persona does jar with the bigger performances going on around him, making him feel slightly miscast, although as Oz himself is a stranger from another world it’s conceivably intentional. Not to say he's bad - Franco is always watchable and is clearly having fun in the role, hamming it up and producing plenty of solidly funny moments. Michelle Williams on the other hand is exceptional as the ‘Good Witch’ – radiating pure Hollywood goodness with a humanity behind her eyes that lights up the screen. Judy Garland would be proud.

The production is a curious mix of flawless and ropey visual effects. Excellent character design (The little China Girl being a memorable highlight) contrasts with plainly artificial backdrops which seemingly allude to cinema past and the aesthetic of the 1939 production but feel awkward and cheap – a poor attempt to cultivate nostalgia and a waste of an opportunity to imagine an entirely new inventive universe. 

Lacking any real tension or threat, it fails to be gripping in many of even the most climactic scenes, staying fairly flat throughout. However, rapid pacing and a decent script keep everything flying along with very few dull moments. A far more worthy film than other family jaunts – director Sam Raimi’s influence is clear, utilising the frights and flashes of black humour that made his name in the ‘Evil Dead’ series. A little too shallow to be considered an out-and-out success, it at least avoids becoming the saccharine romantic morality tale of so many PG adventures. Its heart is in the right place - and offers up 130 minutes of outlandish magical diversion.

I never much cared for Gus Van Sant as a director as his style is frankly uninteresting. However, Elephant seems to be that one time he got it right and the one time the story of the film is in harmony with his slow, cold approach. Long, drawn out shots, natural dialogue and everyday scenarios give the movie an eerily realistic atmosphere as we follow a group of High School kids on their daily routine on what looked to be an ordinary day for them. The camera is almost not noticeable, carefully observing the characters make their way through the hallways, showing their interactions from every character's perspective. The idea is to make the audience grow accustomed to the place and learning of a select few students' troubles, plans, etc. It's done really well and even though it takes a very long time doing so with many minute-long takes of people simply walking, which actually got tedious at some points, it's an effective method.

Due to the way it is shot it's almost as if the audience is transported into the school, slowly getting to know parts of the building and the many faces of its students. The moment we first lay eyes on the perpetrators of the following heinous crime is chilling and makes the anticipation of what is about to happen almost more unnerving than the shooting itself. After showing us the students affected by the shooting we switch perspective and learn of the two kids planning everything. Outwardly completely average, insignificant teenagers, who no one would suspect to commit such a thing. The problem I have is that we simply don't get to spend enough time with the two and the apparent inner hate they carry with them really doesn't come across quite as convincing as it needs to. It's a shame as I think there was a lot of room for Van Sant to do so. The film's final 15-ish minutes are very difficult and almost unbearable to watch. Whether the execution played any part in that or it is merely down to the content I am not sure yet, but it's certainly effective. The very last scene in the freezer is particularly disturbing.

Overall, Elephant is a flawed but ultimately very good film with a thick atmosphere. It doesn't give any great insight into the psyche of the killers, but the 'receiving' end of the incident, the other students that is, is portrayed excellently. I may have written off Gus Van Sant too quickly.

You'll notice that you can no longer downvote submissions. There's logic behind this. 

There seems to be a tendency across Reddit to downvote things when disagreeing with them. That's not the way the downvote system is meant to work. It's there for one reason and one reason only: if the thread or comment is completely irrelevant to the subreddit and the discussion taking place, that's the time to downvote it. But I think people just naturally use it as a way of disagreeing without voicing that disagreement. I can understand that, but it doesn’t help our sub, which is meant to be a discussion forum as well as a place to submit reviews. If someone posts ‘you’re a c***’ in our sub, that’s irrelevant and should be downvoted. Actually, you should hit the ‘report’ button really. If someone posts ‘Lesley Nielson is the funniest man on the planet’ and you disagree with this, this should not be downvoted. You should engage with the Nielson fan about why you disagree, give examples of your reasoning and start a discussion. If said Nielson fan and you just can’t come to an agreement and you think he or she is a numpty, don’t downvote, just don’t reply. Silence is golden. 
However, if you genuinely do agree and it is relevant to the submission, give them an upvote.

**When you see an excellent review, upvote. Encourage people to take the time!**

NB: you can’t downvote submissions but you can downvote comments. I’d still discourage the latter though. /r/DaedalusMinion put a little CSS note embedded in downvotes, seems to fit with how we think downvotes should work. 

Anyway, I digress a bit. I don’t want any review downvoted. I think we’ve made it clear that if you think there is NO review, a pointless review, or someone linking to their blog or YouTube that you hit the ‘report’ button. We’re hot on getting rid of these; at least twice a day. I don’t want people to be discouraged from posting because they’re afraid they’ll get downvoted for their opinions. We don’t want people to only post about popular films or popular opinions only for fear of getting downvotes otherwise (an example: IJW: the Matrix, amazing film, Keanu is great!! – my initial reaction would be to downvote – I hate both him and the film, but the grown-up thing to do would be to either ignore it (and not upvote) or comment about why I’d dispute that). Everyone in this sub is entitled to his or her opinion. Everyone who reads the content is entitled to disagree via conversation or hit the report button if it’s just inappropriate or offensive. **Everyone is entitled to be their own film critic, regardless of how good their grammar is, which points they hit or miss, and/or whether they completely miss the entire point of the film or not. This is why we are reiterating the discussion forum element. Let people talk about it, let them make mistakes in their perceptions and let them learn a bit more about films, concepts, whatever via constructive discussions.**

I should mention we absolutely will not tolerate trolls. I have no patience for them and I will ban them immediately. 

We’ve changed a lot of the rules in the last month, let’s not assume everyone has seen them, everyone reads the sidebar (a lot of smartphones don’t show it), or that everyone remembers the rules. Let us, as moderators, manage this transition. In the meantime, please be a bit thoughtful and kind to your fellow posters. If you think ‘that’s not much of a review… it says nothing’ report it to us. Let us talk to the submitter about it. Same goes to missing IMDB links. It’s going to take a while til people get used to it. Don't post shitty comments. It doesn't make people feel good. Don't assume they know about new rules or can see the sidebar.

As always, please feel free to comment or make suggestions.

I hope you’re all enjoying the sub. We've gained another 32 readers since I did a few PR posts a few nights ago, so it's nice to know that new people think it's good enough to subscribe to.

1362260859.0,11,self.Ijustwatched,19jjc5,IJW: Searching For Sugar Man (2012) - documentary about a lost musician who was compared to Dylan,Girlwithnousername,11,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/19jjc5/ijw_searching_for_sugar_man_2012_documentary/,"I highly recommend not googling the artist’s name before watching the documentary unless you want it completely spoilt for you.

The opening 30 seconds: ""It’s 40 years since this LP called Cold Fact by Rodriguez was released and in South Africa it was a very popular album, it was one of the biggest albums of the day. But the thing was, we didn’t know who this guy Rodriguez was. All our other rock stars, we had all the information we needed, but this guy – there was nothing.""

(quote continues in the spoiler section).

In 1970s apartheid-era South Africa, everything they saw on TV was regulated. They had no idea what countries outside of SA thought of apartheid, of their country - they were a very isolated people. Sanctions were in place and most live musicians were not allowed to tour there. 

Nobody quite knew how a small-time artist called Rodriguez exploded; in fact they don’t even know how his music came to the country in the first place as it was not released there. But what his music did was to unite the youth of the day who felt as though things were very wrong with regard to segregation and the general direction SA was heading towards, but due to such harsh policing tactics, the youth did not feel as though they had a voice. Rodriguez’s music really hit home for them. He was a free spirit and a visionary, he encouraged rebellion and free-thinking. 

He was likened to Bob Dylan (but adored way beyond levels of Dylan, even Elvis within SA).

So. Who was Rodriguez? Nobody was ever able to find anything out about him. And what ever happened to him?

***SPOILER FOLLOWS***

Continuation of opening 30 seconds quote: 

""…and then we found out that he had committed suicide. He set himself alight on stage and burnt to death in front of the audience. It was the most incredible thing, it wasn’t just a suicide, it was probably the most grotesque suicide in rock history.""

However. There’s much more to it than that, and the above spoiler could possibly be misleading.

Watch it and see.

The story is pretty crazy and could get you a little confused but stay with it and it all becomes clear pretty fast.

I would have rather watched her get her soul sucked out of her face, then see all the build up around her ""fight"" scenes. The fights themselves could have delivered a lot more.

I totally recommend to anyone who loves mystery films mixed with history, and doesn't mind the subtitles of a foreign film.

IMDB: **In the DMZ separating North and South Korea, two North Korean soldiers have been killed, supposedly by one South Korean soldier. But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining bullets in the assassin's magazine clip, amount to 16 bullets for a gun that should normally hold 15 bullets. The investigating Swiss/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.**

The film does a great job at pacing, soundtrack, the different veins of the story that culminate into a satisfying (well, as satisfying as this sort of film can get) conclusion. I've always been somewhat curious about the relationship between North and South Korea.. and while this is clearly a dramatization in many ways, I still found it entirely relatable and mesmerizing.

Not too many issues except the investigator assigned to the case was sort of boring and was the weakest out of the crew.

1332892143.0,8,self.Ijustwatched,rgo2n,IJW Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974),OneSalientOversight,10,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/rgo2n/ijw_alice_doesnt_live_here_anymore_1974/,"I found out about this film many years ago when it was referenced in a Simpsons Halloween episode as ""Alice Doesn't Live Anymore"".

This 1970s film was obviously influenced by the growing feminist movement at the time, but doesn't come across as militant. There's no doubt that Alice (Ellen Burstyn) is dependent upon and controlled by her horrible husband but then to suddenly be informed that he has been killed literally within a minute of her telling a friend that she could ""quite happily live without a man"" was tragic and ironic.

So... could she live without a man? The audience both feel her pain at the loss of the man she loves but also happiness that she has been given freedom from an emotionally abusive relationship.

We soon find, however, that freedom is a double edged sword. With no husband comes no income and Alice and her son Tommy (Alfred Lutter) move interstate to search for singing work, since Alice has experience as a bar-room singer and piano player.

She finds work but the money is not enough to pay expenses. She then begins a relationship with Ben (Harvey Keitel). Things are looking up until suddenly Alice is confronted by Ben's wife who appears to be in a similar situation - in a controlled, violent relationship and having to care for a child who, unlike Tommy, is continually ill.

Suddenly we see Ben in a different light. At first he appeared young, naive and obsessed. Suddenly he breaks into Alice's room and assaults his wife before then turning upon Alice and telling her in no uncertain terms that she belongs to him now and she'd better wise up to the fact. Harvey Keitel here was brilliant in playing Ben - he's vicious, ruthless and scary. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if his role as Winston Wolf in Pulp Fiction was somehow influenced by his role here - charming at first but you know that underneath he is a scary guy.

Alice and Tommy pack up and leave very quickly. We're happy that she escapes Ben. Then she settles in Tucson where she finds work not as a singer but as a waitress.

The greasy spoon she works in is just right for a sitcom to be based and that is precisely what happens as in the years following this film's release *Alice* appears as a TV series from 1976-1985 with pretty much the same characters. Alice is the waitress who's moved to Tucson after her husband died and dreams of a singing career while simultaneously having to deal with her precocious son; Flo is the sassy, man-hungry head waitress; Valerie is the neurotic, shy high-strung waitress; Mel is the short-order cook; David is a local farmer and Alice's love interest.

The job isn't wonderful but Alice is able to get enough money to support herself and Tommy.

Of course during the film (not the sitcom) we wonder at how good David (Kris Kristofferson) will be. Soon we're disappointed as he seems to turn into yet another manipulative and controlling man, causing Alice to break down again. An argument ensues and we finally see David for who he is - not another Ben but a complex man who actually does love Alice.

As the film ends on a high note, with Alice pondering her new life with David in Tucson, we know that she has won a better life. She still has the dream of being a singer - the argument with David at Mel's confirms that he is willing to sell his farm to be with her and let her follow her dream. She also has financial independence as a waitress, but also the potential for marriage to David, a wealthy farmer. She's also come to terms with the abuse she's suffered over the years.

The reason why ADLHA is a good feminist film is that it shows realistic blue-collar female empowerment. It's not about higher wages or access to professional careers or the glass ceiling. Instead it is about to freedom to control one's life and be happy, not having to be subservient to a man but not anti-man altogether. Alice represents what all women must feel when in a relationship with a man - elation, disappointment, painful attachment. There's no doubt that she loves David but she also loved the abusive Ben and Donald (her dead husband). A relationship with a man is not something that is dismissed in the film (as per radical feminism) but is accepted and seen as one of the most important part of Alice's life - yet these relationships are painful and sometimes abusive. ADLHA doesn't end with a radical feminist victory by allowing Alice to live happily without any male relationship at all - instead it grants her the victory of happiness while simultaneously granting her a positive relationship with a male.

Ellen Burstyn rightly won the academy award for this role. She was able to convey a huge range of emotions throughout the film. The audience laughed and cried with her, and felt her fear when she was threatened. We were so used to seeing her cry that when Flo says some humourous line in a loud argument with Mel, we naturally assume that the intensity of the argument brought Alice's emotions to the fore. Flo obviously thought so when she went over to comfort her, but we then realise the reason why Alice was doubled up with her hands over her face was because she could not control her laughter at the Flo/Mel confrontation. Suddenly we see a victory for her and the event leads to a deep friendship between Flo and Alice.

The Mel's diner actors - Vic Tayback as Mel, Diane Ladd as Flo and Valerie Curtin as Vera - had enough oomph and personality put into their roles that there was no doubt a sitcom would follow. Of the three only Vic Tayback managed to reprise his role in the sitcom. Since I never saw the sitcom I can only imagine how good he was.

Kris Kristofferson has never been a favourite actor of mine. As far as I'm concerned the only role of substance he played that I enjoyed was that of Charlie Wade in the 1996 film *Lone Star*. His role here was effective but not outstanding.

As I pointed out before, Harvey Keitel's role in this film - short though it was - deserves some sort of praise. His anger and fury as Ben are frightening to behold. Who wouldn't want to married to him?

Jodie Foster has a bit part in the film, mainly to provide Tommy (Alfred Lutter) with character development. Foster was 12 in this film and right from the beginning she dominated her scenes with Tommy in a way that presaged her adult career - even at 12 she had an impressive screen presence. Scorsese would use her and Keitel in his next film, *Taxi Driver*, very effectively.

I'm sad that Alfred Lutter didn't make it as an adult actor. Although Foster dominated his scenes with her, he would often dominate the scenes he had with Burstyn and Kristofferson. His character was wonderfully quirky and his confidence was obviously high. He wasn't even able to maintain his role in the sitcom and was replaced after the pilot episode. He would've made a wonderful adult actor - probably not as great as Jodie Foster but certainly one good enough to earn a decent living. I wonder what happened to him.

This was a good film. ",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_rgo2n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/rgo2n/ijw_alice_doesnt_live_here_anymore_1974/,

Though, to be fair, the Germans in Stalag 17 were far more intelligent and resourceful than the bumbling idiots in HH.

I loved Sgt Schultz. ""I am your friend!"" he declares over and over. He even has some great banter with the POWs.

The comedy duo of Animal and Shapiro is so well done that it deserves far more praise than it has received. From the get-go these two clowns dominate the film's lighter moments. This culminates with a drunk Animal dancing with a Betty Grable looking Shapiro and murmuring sweet nothings to him/her.

The bit parts are great too. There's the guy who receives a letter from his wife saying that a baby was left on their doorstep and you wouldn't believe it but the baby has her mouth and eyes and nose. ""I believe it"" the man says, nodding his head in confusion and acceptance. The fact that he's been duped by an unfaithful wife is something the audience, and only the audience, is privvy to but this requires a step of understanding from the audience (which shows that the director respected their intelligence).

Then there's the announcement guy - the guy who moves from barracks to barracks and gives announcements and hands out letters. ""NEXT"" he says in a strange high pitched voice after everyone has quieted down from the last announcement. ""AT EASE"" he yells, everyone then yells ""AT EASE"", then Animal yells out louder ""AT EASE"", there is a moment of quiet and then ""NEXT"".

William Holden's character is wonderful. I'm glad he was compelled by the director and the movie studio to keep his character selfish and morally ambiguous. Had Holden had his way his character would've had some more positive elements. As a result his character was more compelling - he was a selfish jerk who took advantage of his fellow POWs and even bribed the Germans a few times... but he was also the one who discovered the traitor in their midst after being mistreated by suspicious comrades. Holden's character (Sefton) was repugnant but the audience knew that he was innocent of the crime of betrayal and while we could understand the frustration of his comrades (and even identify with them) Sefton's beating at their hands left us with an unpleasant taste in our mouth - that an innocent man (though repugnant) was being punished for a crime he didn't commit.

As the film progresses I, along with the original audience obviously, began to theorise as to who the betrayer was. I had the idea early on that it was the silent guy suffering from PTSD but was surprised that it ended up as someone else.

A few issues I had: If the guys in Barracks 4 were so certain that Sefton was the spy, why did they leave his punishment at merely a severe beating? Given the fact that people had died because of the betrayer, you would've thought that a lynching of Sefton was in order. Moreover they continued to discuss secret plans in front of Sefton despite their belief that he was a spy in their midst.

The unmasking of the spy at the end was not done well enough either. There was too much circumstantial evidence presented to the POWs from someone they didn't trust much anyway.

As for the spy's punishment and death... why not just fall to the ground silent and yell out ""help"" in German rather than stumble around making noise and attracting the attention of the machinegunners in the watch towers? After all - that was the plan the POWs explicitly told the spy was his punishment.

Holden was brilliant and deserved his oscar for this. Director Billy Wilder goes up and up in my estimation.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_raps9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/raps9/ijw_stalag_17_1953/,

Sadly those performances don't compensate for a poorly thought out story.

For those who don't want it spoiled, I'll just say that you shouldn't waste your money in theaters. Wait until this is available on Netflix watch instant, and then ask yourself if you want to waste two hours on a story that won't delivery in the end.

*SPOILER TERRITORY AHOY*

From a scientific angle the notion of two planet earths in the solar system right next to each other with no ill consequences is total bullshit. The gravitational effects would wreak havoc, but I was willing to let that go as a necessary flaw for a story about what the possibility of alternate realities would mean for everyday ordinary people. If I can suspend disbelief for a spider bite or radiation accident giving someone super powers, I can let this slide too.

The rest of the plot I can't be so forgiving about. The main character Rhoda starts out the story by causing a car wreck (possibly while under the influence of alcohol as I recall her drinking at the party) through her inattention. That lands her in prison for a four year stretch.

The rest of the movie seems to mostly forget that she's a convicted felon though. Sure it's mentioned in her essay, but it never feels like she's actually a felon because she isn't going through anything resembling a felon's return to society. For starters she'd be on parole/probation and have a lot of rules to follow. Those rules usually include things like being limited in travel options. A felon usually needs permission to leave the state, and here she is getting booked on a trip off planet with nary a problem.

Another rule that felons have to follow is that they aren't allowed to contact the person they wronged. They have to sign an agreement saying that they won't even write them a letter lest they face heavy penalties like going back to prison. Sure we can assume that Rhoda is a character stupid or naive enough to justify breaking such a rule out of a misguided need for absolution, but the lack of any mention of what she's risking by even knocking on Burroughs door is a glaring omission.

It also seems idiotic that all of the major breakthroughs with this other earth are happening when they do. This alternate planet has been in the sky right next to us for four fucking years and we're only now getting around to making radio contact with them?! And that's only happening shortly after the announcement of a contest to win a slot on the first space flight to this oddity? Also it seems really poorly thought out that this flight is coming out of the corporate sector instead of the government. I imagine this is supposed to be some sort of nod to the direction that space exploration is actually going, but under such an extraordinary set of circumstances the idea that NASA wouldn't immediately get involved and put in charge of this (with it's hugest budget increase in 20 or 30 years) is ridiculous. Again, all of this stuff taking four years to get put into motion is just moronic. It's like the rest of the world put itself on hold so Rhoda could get her prison sentence taken care of without missing anything important.

These might seem like minor things to complain about, but they aren't. A minor complaint would be Rhoda running into the guy she was dancing with at her congratulatory party four years ago and him being surprised that she's working as a janitor instead of a teacher as though he and everyone in her social circle wouldn't have heard that she went to prison for vehicular manslaughter. A minor complaint would be that the movie has way to many fucking shots of Rhoda staring blankly into space like she's distracted by some stray speck of dust. I know it's supposed to give the film a quiet, introspective feel, but it just comes off as boring and pretentious.

The plot problems I'm angry about, tell me that this story wasn't thought through beyond it's basic premise of using the multiverse theory as a way to explore second chances and forgiveness. That exploration is badly delivered and culminates in the way that Rhoda ultimately earns her redemption, which is also poorly though out. Once she hears the idea that events on Earth 2 may have been identical to her world only up to the point where they discovered each other, she rushes over to John's house to give him her ticket because there's a chance that his family is still alive on the other Earth. The only problem with this idea is that if they are alive on Earth 2, so is an alternate version of John. Which would make the John Burroughs that we're seeing become the ultimate 5th wheel intruding on a group of people that have no place for him. What kind of consolation is that?

If the movie had stopped there I might have been somewhat okay with that. I could have shrugged it off as an ambitious attempt at saying something important that fell flat. Unfortunately the creators chose to go one step further and flush away what little credibility they had left. The parting shot of Rhoda coming home from her shitty day job only to see her alternate self in the driveway before cutting to credits... that was just too much of an insult. I imagine a lot of people will try to justify this as a clever and ambiguous way to end the story. It isn't. It's lazy writing. It honestly felt like the director/writer couldn't figure out a way to end the story and went with the best shocker he could pull out of his ass.

*END SPOILERS*

So to reiterate, there are some good, even great performances in this movie. Brit Marling and William Mapother really make the dialogue come alive. There's a side character named Purdeep (whose whole story goes nowhere and seems like something from another movie that got stuck in this one) and the actor who played him gave a good performance with the little screen time he had to work with. The people playing Rhoda's family all give serviceable performances as well.

Those performances are not however, worth the five bucks I spent on my ticket. If you're thinking of seeing this at your local art house indie theater don't.

I thoroughly enjoyed this cops and robbers movie. From start to finish this movie weaves together action, intrigue, suspense and a human element in the vein of Heat (not The Heat), The Departed, Infernal Affairs and other great cops and robbers movies. The influences throughout are clear, right from plot development, great standoffs and even music. Both James McAvoy and Mark Strong  played their parts excellently, the gun fights and action sequences were all top notch. Welcome to the Punch holds it own as a good crime drama but where it could go from good to great it fails in the 'conspiracy' being too far removed from the main characters and the ending left a little to be desired (see Elite Squad 2 for an idea of how to end something like this).

Would ‘Manhattan’ or ‘Clerks’ be as well remembered in Technicolor? ‘Frances Ha’ makes a wonderful use of the medium, stripping out superfluous detail and concentrating on its loveable central character Frances (Greta Gerwig), a 27-year-old New Yorker who is floundering her way into adulthood, moving from apartment to apartment and struggling to pay the bills with her infrequent work as a dancer. When her long time best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner) moves out to live with her boyfriend, Frances is cast adrift and attempts to find a little direction in her shambolic life.

This is a downright joyous experience, so refreshing and funny it’s hard to see where it could be improved. For a start it's uplifting to see a portrayal of genuine female characters that aren’t just two-dimensional foils for male leads and who actually look and behave like real people. When Frances and Sophie are slobbing around in the apartment in sweat pants and no make-up, that’s what they look like – not a dolled up Hollywood version of it. The most welcome change though is that it isn’t about romance or Frances ‘finding a man’ to give her life some meaning: a tired, predictable theme that makes for dull, crowd-pleasing cinema – and bears next to no relation to life. 'Frances Ha' is about Frances, not about her love life or big life-changing moments. Realism is high on the agenda throughout and to its credit it doesn’t resort to grit, nudity or sex to convey that – proving that strong characterisation is always what matters most.

Its success predominantly rests on co-writer and star Greta Gerwig who is absolutely fantastic, creating such a naturally enchanting character in Frances that you’d need a cold heart not to come away with a deep affection for her. She’s eccentric, awkward and goofy, but in a wholly plausible, endearing way – doing the weird little things we all do when no one's around. Most importantly she’s not just a great comedy character, she’s a real person; we’re laughing both with and at her, but we still intensely care about her.

‘Frances Ha’ is a small-scale film that may have the aesthetic of a student work, but it’s also incredibly technically sound, using structure and pace expertly. A year or so of Frances's life is segmented into the different addresses she has lived at, weaving her ups and downs together with montages and short scenes of all the little incidental things in life. Unconcerned with too much exposition we are dropped into Brooklyn and fly through this confusing transitional year in her life, the film passing by as quickly as the years that are escaping Frances.

Here is a film that deserves to be cherished by everyone – an honest and uplifting journey through friendship and adulthood, as sweetly touching as it is hilarious. Add into that the best use of Bowie’s ‘Modern Love’ in cinema and an ambiguous title that reveals itself as another perfect detail and you’ve got an exceptional film, the memory of which will always put a smile on your face. Ahoy Sexy!

It's too bad The Spectacular Now is rated R because the teenagers being kept out of theaters are the ones who will undoubtedly feel the deepest connection to it. I kind of hope they sneak into this movie in droves because if they don't they're missing out on maybe the first movie of their generation that will plug into their actual experiences in an honest, sincere way, with no supernatural twists or fantastical metaphors.

It's not soul-crushingly dark like Kids was for my generation, or charmingly iconic like Say Anything... in the '80s. But somewhere in the middle you get The Spectacular Now, which feels more real than anything I've seen onscreen all year.

That's not to say it's perfect, but we'll get to that in a minute.

The movie opens with Miles Teller (think Shia LaBeouf's more likable little brother) as Sutter Keely, sitting down to write a college admissions letter on the topic of some difficulty or hardship he's had to face. As a plot device it's an obvious one, used mostly for exposition the first time around, and to force the the oh-so-messed-up young Sutter to examine himself later in the movie. It's just barely better than outright voiceover.

Sutter is about to graduate from high school, but he's drunk and sad because his hot, fun, smart girlfriend (Brie Larson) just dumped him. Together the two of them were drunk and happy, and as he puts it ""indestructible."" He can't quite articulate it because he's a teenager, but he's thiiiis close to realizing that without her — his partner in mischief — his alcoholism stops seeming like fun, and starts looking pathetic. He's also about to learn how far from indestructible he really is.

Enter Shailene Woodley as the so-naive-it-hurts Aimee Finicky — convincing as a mostly ignored girl who doesn't realize how much better her life is without Sutter in it. She's living with her absentee mother and paying their bills by getting up at 5am every day to deliver newspapers. One Saturday morning she discovers Sutter passed out on a stranger's lawn, and wakes him up. Sparks don't exactly fly, but there's obviously a strange chemistry between the clown and the wallflower, who exist in wholly different strata of the high school hierarchy. From the distance of adulthood the two aren't very different, but director James Ponsoldt successfully assigns every dissimilarity the profound weight of teenage scrutiny.

Those differences and similarities are expertly eked out over the course of the next 90 minutes as Sutter and Aimee act as each other's catalysts for the psycho-chemical process of growing up. In that process, Ponsoldt gets you to fall in love with these two leads — both of whom seem poised on the edge of being Big Deals. The strength of the movie is that it can communicate Sutter's worst qualities while at the same time making the audience (seriously this is what happened in my screening) audibly say ""awwww"" as he half-drunkenly kisses Aimee for the first time. I know this stuff is going to relate closest to white surburban middle class kids, but that (for better or worse) describes me at 17, and pieces of this movie felt like stepping through a time machine it was so real.

The three crowning moments come in a deftly written dinner scene (instantly one of my favorites of all time), a brilliantly underplayed sex scene, and a bar scene where Sutter reconnects with his estranged father. That last one will hit close to home for some. As Sutter, Teller's face is as legible as a book, several realizations dawning on him at once as his twitchy dad, played by Kyle Chandler, disabuses him of the illusions he had of a hero patriarch kicked out of the house by his uptight mother.

Before we go any further, let's talk about Shailene Woodley. A lot of comparisons are being made between her and Jennifer Lawrence, to the point that she's probably getting annoyed with them. But they're to her benefit. Last year's double-whammy of Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook established Lawrence as the archetype for a new generation's A-list leading lady. And Woodley is definitely in her league. It's hard not to see a parallel between Lawrence and Woodley, who has her own double whammy between this, and the upcoming Divergent franchise. She enjoyed awards buzz two years ago for her performance as George Clooney's drunken daughter in The Descendants, and is winning key roles in both critical darlings and blockbusters.

Woodley is the vulnerable, exposed heart of The Spectacular Now. Her role isn't as flashy as Lawrence's in Silver Linings Playbook, but her journey is no less significant. This movie would have been every bit as good if it were told from her perspective and not Sutter's. It might have been even better, playing like some deconstruction of teen movies like She's All That. Here's an introverted girl uninterested in popularity who finds herself dating a popular, funny, boy who changes her in deep ways while nearly destroying everything good about her. Director Ponsoldt gives her several key close-ups and every one makes you feel more connected to and protective of this girl.

Now onto those flaws. Some critics will find fault with The Spectacular Now's twee style. The entire thing does look like it was filtered through Instagram in some attempt to tap into a cheap nostalgia. And, of course, there are people who will ask, ""How many more movies do we need about white middle class problems?"" And the movie barely passes the Bechdel test. And Shailene Woodley's character seems to be cruelly written with a blind spot that makes her oblivious at times to the point of idiocy. But in the words of the movie's Keely Sutter, ""get off my motherf---ing back!"" I loved this movie, and it already has the hallmarks of a cultural touchstone for kids who grew up with Harry Potter and are seeking something more authentic than they've been given so far.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1jol8f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1jol8f/ijw_the_spectacular_now_2013/,

Pros: I liked that they touched on how life is different in the post apocalypse and wish they'd spent more time on that. In shows like this the world they live in is the single most important character and it's usually underwritten.

Cons: There was some over the top gore near the end that made me roll my eyes. Much like ""John Dies At The End"", this feels like a TV pilot that never got picked up. Everything from the setup, the costumes, the budget... even the same kind of unresolved ending and plot holes. I can picture at least 3 seasons of winter wastelands and summery flashbacks ala Revolution or Lost.

This is one of the more visually awesome sci fi films I've seen recently, reminded me a little of Tron in the uniformity of design/colour schemes throughout the movie'. The plot is enjoyable and intriguing although at points a tad predictable to anyone who's been a lifelong fan of the genre. Cruise performed well, the side characters of Freeman and Olga Kurylenko were pretty 1 dimensional although Andrea Riseborough did a fantastic job portraying her character. However it was the visual effects and action sequences rather than the characters that kept me engrossed and Oblivion definitely outperforms for the genre on that.

Chronologically charting a long history of orca attacks in captivity ‘Blackfish’ effortlessly pieces together the story of the animals, highlighting the inhumanity and dangers of keeping them captive. Through interviews with former trainers and experts it paints a remarkable picture of the vast, graceful creatures who clearly deeply affect the lives of everyone they touch. Incredibly social animals, they are apparently capable of the same emotional complexity as humans, and this is the film's crux – as a species we’ve taken a beautiful living being that is one of nature’s most intelligent, and reduced it to living in a swimming pool and performing circus tricks for tourists. The conflict felt by all the trainers runs deep: they love these animals and their company, but they are equally aware of their unknowability and the cruelty they face – it’s complex powerful stuff.

By far its most memorable moments are the home video and press footage captured at SeaWorld, that demonstrate the sheer size and power of the orcas in relation to their trainers. Seeing one clamp a man’s tiny foot between its teeth and repeatedly drag him beneath the surface is harrowing unforgettable viewing. As these attacks and warnings are intercut with cheery promotional television ads spouting half truths and lies about the whales, the tragedies take on an incredible added poignancy. As SeaWorld declined to be involved in the project this does present an entirely one-sided view that occasionally has the air of a charity awareness film, but the revelations and imagery are so astounding this doesn’t pose a problem – anyway, no one in their right mind can claim these animals aren’t experiencing a lower quality of life at human hands.

On the surface ‘Blackfish’ is a gripping story of death and cover-ups, but it’s also an accessible allegory of the narcissism and arrogance of the human race, attempting to claim a wonderful, spiritual creature as a plaything. The kind of film that uses entertainment as a medium to engage, inform - and expose our self-righteous flaws.

Amazing fight scenes, everything about them is perfect. None of that jump cut shaky bullshit.

The music was top, and flowed very well with the combat.

The opponents where unique. It's not just one guy beating up a bunch of other guys, they have their own fighting styles, too.

The first chase seen was a blast. Lots of cool stunts and a bit of humor.

**Disliked**

Muay. Oh my god. I have never hated a character so much. I get that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but come on. Her acting was embarrassing, her voice was annoying, and she served no purpose other than to be a women which makes people motivated to help her when she's in trouble. Same with all the other women in the show. ""Oh this guys getting beaten up, I don't care. Oh no! He's assaulting a women! I must help!""

The three wheeled car scene. There was not a moment I enjoyed during this part. Just out of no where there's like 50 of these fucking cars and half of them tip over one tenth way into the scene. Not a single scene was interesting, it was just driving and some unrealistic physics. Sloppy.

Boring plot with lots of padding. The whole plot is go get X thing, and there's just padding between that.

**Conclusion**

Good casual fun. Don't try and take this movie seriously and just enjoy the show.

I actually really enjoyed a lot of the fight scenes, and they were quite varied, which was refreshing from usual movies.

Having finally seen the movie, I can say that it is is absolutely wonderful, and is a zombie film that has almost everything. Pegg and Frost are able to deliver humour and poignancy in equal measure at just the right points in the film, which develops into much more than a flat and boring ""one-two-shoot-you"" flick. Props also go to Dylan Moran who's on fine form, and the several leading British comic actors who make short appearances at one point or other.

While there's a lot of action, there's also lots of glorious subtext in the film, which makes it a joy to watch on several levels.

I really enjoyed it! Everything was great, the story was interesting, the main character was likable, and the cinematography was fantastic like most of Allen's works. I was never a big fan of Owen Wilson, but he was perfect in this role, and did a fantastic job! *To Rome With Love* is the only other modern Woody Allen movie I have seen, as I am new to his films, and *Midnight In Paris* is clearly superior to it.

After hearing people talk about how overrated it was, I decided I had to check it out myself. I enjoyed it. It wasn't especially incredible, and I do think Scorsese's other films were better, but it was, at the very least, enjoyable. The Departed was a good contender for best film, but I think Children of Men did deserve that praise.

The best part of the movie is the cast; they all do such a great job. Even Mark Wahlberg, whose only other film that I really enjoyed was I Heart Huckabees, plays a character that I think was tailor-made for him. Damon and DiCaprio are great also.

One gripe I had with this movie was the editing. I understand that the film couldn't overstay its welcome, so it had to cut very quickly at points in order to keep things going, but MAN some of the editing was very, very distracting.
Overall, this was an overrated movie which I found to still be quite good. 7.5/10.

Singularly obsessed with owning a bike – completely out of the question for a girl – she does all she can to save her money, dreaming of one day racing her friend Abdullah. Meanwhile her home life is in turmoil as her mother strives to convince her father (Sultan Al Assaf) not to take a second wife. But in Wadjda’s naivety all the cultural constraints facing her and her mother are nothing more than obstacles to the freedom of riding a shiny new green bicycle.

'Wadjda' is most notable for being the first feature film to be shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, but more remarkable than that, is the fact it was directed by a woman, Haifaa al-Mansour. That this hasn’t happened until 2013 is jaw-dropping, and adds huge weight to the film. Imagining the constraints of the production and the adversity she plainly would’ve faced in her career make Wadjda’s turmoil all the more poignant.

The drama itself is thoroughly enjoyable, making for some lovely moments of gentle humour and pathos – but it truly comes into its own as a fascinating study of what it means to be a woman in Saudi Arabia. Never preaching, it simply presents the challenges of domestic life for women in an Islamic society, a completely absurd alien world to many of us in the West. Not being allowed to drive, hiding your voice from men, arranged marriages of children – all these oppressive customs are viewed in passing by the young Wadjda, but equally the film never condemns the religion, showing those who are at peace and able to find solace in the words of the Koran.

Newcomer Waad Mohammed is genuinely remarkable in the titular role. A young woman bursting with life, she is barely off the screen and is more than capable of carrying the picture alone. She instils the character with a wholly authentic mettle and joy and is not only natural, but in possession of a wonderful emotional range. The scenes she shares with Reem Abdullah are the film’s strongest, with a beautifully honest mother-and-daughter chemistry that again feels incredibly poignant in the context of the film as a milestone.

This is a staggeringly accomplished debut that presents its powerful social commentary in a light, accessible drama – showing a challenging subject through the naivety of a child’s eyes, a technique that makes the injustices facing women all the more resonant. An intelligent, important film that demonstrates what the best cinema is capable of – opening our lives to the experiences of others, through the medium of entertainment.

Following the apparent accidental death of his brother, he travels to his northern hometown for the first time in decades to investigate what really became of him. Tangling with ghosts from his past, local gangsters and anything in a skirt Jack is pulled forever deeper into the dingy underworld in his unyielding search for justice – not only for his own peace of mind but for his teenage niece, Doreen (Petra Markham) who has been cast adrift by her deceased father.

This is a quintessentially British noir, set in terraced streets and country roads under bleak grey skies – feeling all the more grim and dangerous because of it. Caine cuts a perfect anti-hero in the mould of pulp hardboiled detectives. Laconic, ruthless and with an answer to everything, he possesses a cold-heartedness that is only warmed whilst dealing with Doreen who represents a purity and innocence in an otherwise black seedy town. The convoluted plot filled with sex and death also shares much with pulp fiction; Jack traces clues and corruption from one confrontation to the next, interrogating shady characters in dive bars and high rises. Set in England’s industrial north, and not Raymond Chandler’s L.A., it is charged with an oppressive bitter mood The Golden State could never offer.

Creating a genuinely tough watch that dispenses with almost any sentimentality, Jack single-mindedly tracks down the truth, exploiting anyone he crosses paths with. He’s a wholly unsympathetic, distant character, but Caine’s steely presence and charisma woven with the remorseless nature of his actions, his carnal lust and the winding mysteries of his dead brother bring you under the film's spell with enough power to keep the film compelling as its plot takes increasingly complex twists and turns. Its evocative power also stems from a haunting melancholy recurring theme, constructed of chiming harpsichord notes echoing around the screen with a delicacy that juxtaposes with the film’s aggression, every bit as memorable as the film itself. 

‘Get Carter’ is a little too chaotic to provide the narrative satisfaction it wants to, but the sombre embittered visit to the North of England is such an intoxicating one the journey alone provides all the dark pleasures required.

I don't usually like feature length courtroom dramas as I'm convinced that TV does this better. But I gave it a go and I wasn't so disappointed.
Ryan Gosling seems to lose the Texas twang every now and then and Anthony Hopkins has a convincing Irish-ish accent. The movie started out well. The movie is quickly set up but it didn't feel rushed. The progression was steady. And the ending was fair. 

I sympathized with Goslings character. There were a couple of key moments that were predictable but Gosling played the character so well that I was in for the ride and I let him drive. Hopkins on the other hand was going into Hannibal Lecter mode. I'm disappointed that the director let him do that. It felt like he put more effort on the accent. 

The supporting characters were TV caliber at best. No scene stealers. 

Overall, I was in the right mood at the right time. I'll probably change my mind later as I'm still digesting the movie but I probably won't update.

I have no idea what just happened. Field of Dreams is incredibly corny, sentimental, and devoid of conflict, a film that on paper should be absolutely horrible and torture for mind and body. However, from beginning to end I was completely invested in this magical, charming little movie, and despite knowing how cheesy it is I found it to be very moving and heart-warming. There is something about it that just makes it work and really won me over within minutes. When something this sentimental gets made today it'd be a cynical, mean-spirited cash-grab on unsuspecting or undemanding audiences, but the 80s seemed to have been the perfect time for movies like this. The film is so naïvely innocent in nature, and so lovingly made, I struggle to believe anyone could have a negative reaction to it.

Field of Dreams in some ways really harks back to Classic Hollywood with its lack of real conflict or anything truly threatening whatsoever, the charming lead in the form of Costner (who really is perfect as a man going through his mid-life crisis), and the sweet humour. There are moments that will make you laugh heartily and moments that will have you sob uncontrollably, wrapped together in an All-American fashion, and carrying a distinctly youthful spirit. Despite not seeming that way at first glance it touches upon some real, mature themes, mostly about father-and-son relationships, and does so with grace and intelligence.

A classic example of cinema magic, and a film I am glad to have watched. Don't judge this one by the poster art or the frankly ridiculous premise, as it's really something special. It's no technical masterpiece and doesn't deal with heavy issues of world importance, but it's such a pleasant, sweet, and innocent film. Sometimes that's all you need.

Noah Baumbach's personal story of his own adolescence and how he and his family dealt with the separation of his parents is a film rich in emotion, even if its characters often try their best to repress them. The conflicts feel real and the characters tangible, The Squid and the Whale is a surprisingly realistic account of a divorce and the effects it has on each of the family members. There are times when it's funny and times when it's incredibly sad, without ever feeling forced at anything. Although not always expressed verbally, one can see the anguish in each of the characters through their actions and demeanors. What I expected to be a highly quirky comedy with a bittersweet ending turned out to be staggeringly human in its portrayal of a broken family. It's a very quiet film that, especially in retrospect, says a lot more than what can be found on its surface.

Baumbach clearly poured his heart into this film and it really shows. The characters so accurately represent people I've met in the past they could only stem from actual persons. Laura Linney, Jeff Daniels, Owen Kline and especially Jesse Eisenberg impress with their subtle, low-key performances and make some of the scenes painful to watch. Eisenberg's turn as the insecure, pretentious teenager always seeking his father's approval at everything he does, is layered and impressive for his age. He perfected his acting capabilities in The Social Network, but early on in his career already showed his promising talent. The Squid and the Whale is a very short film, but the amount of subtext fit into these 80 minutes is impressive and the end result is very moving.

Lilo &amp; Stitch marks one of the last truly great films to come out of Disney Animation Studios and despite always wanting to I never really got the chance to watch it. A huge loss on my behalf as it turns out to be a hilarious and genuinely warm-hearted piece of animation, harking back to the now classic E.T. and The Iron Giant. The concept wasn't new by the time it came out and we'd already been enriched with two lovable aliens in the past, but as is evident with this it still wasn't fully explored yet. Stitch at first appears to be almost the exact opposite of the calm and sensitive giant/E.T., being aggressive in nature and distrusting almost everyone. His relationship with Lilo develops very differently, beginning as merely a means of protecting himself, but as time goes by slowly growing into a bond.

Like with the two other already mentioned films, the main character is a young child whose quirks and differences alienate people around them, hindering their ability to have real friendships. Also recurring is the theme of lost parents and a mother figure severely overwhelmed by her responsibilities. A broken family, who through the help of Stitch find themselves again. It's been done before but Lilo &amp; Stitch offers a new spin on the whole idea and with enough variables being changed ends up being wonderfully charming and due to its eye-meltingly beautiful animation quite a ride for the senses. The only real fault I can think of is the series of action scenes towards the end, which are entirely unnecessary and remind me of the many mistakes Disney has made since then. It doesn't ruin the film, but certainly sticks out as bitter in what is otherwise sweet and endearing.

Recovering alcoholic Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire) recounts his time in 1920’s New York with the mysterious, monumentally rich Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). After a failed short-lived life as a writer Nick moves to Long Island to take a finance job in the city where he meets his neighbour, the elusive Gatsby - who no one seems to have met, but whose hedonistic parties at his palatial house are attended in droves every weekend. Striking up an odd friendship, Gatsby seems determined to prove his social standing to Nick, showing off his wealth at any opportunity, and it’s only when it becomes clear he has a past with Nick’s married cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) that his mysterious life begins to be laid bare.

A Luhrmann film is never going to be emotionally complex or challenging, but you can always rely on his stylised worlds and pop sensibilities to provide enough riotous entertainment to create involvement. Unfortunately ‘Gatsby’ doesn’t really offer either. The design and presentation are admirable in their adventure and attention to detail – but it all feels markedly digital and phoney. The overblown visual effects are clearly a creative decision but unfortunately they rob the opulence of all its value, leaving New York feeling like a detached, distant array of backdrops and pixels. 

The first hour is particularly torturous, taking forever to kick into gear, and despite plenty of ‘stuff’ splashing around on the screen the storytelling is so clunky it’s near impossible to become involved. All the actors produce solid performances – DiCaprio being particularly charismatic – but there isn’t really much for them to get their teeth into. Decent exchanges are frequently lost in restless panning and sweeping cameras and layers of decorative gloss. Constant distraction from the characters and narrative leave large portions of the film incredibly dull and slow. The 2 minute trailer captures the debauched hedonism and style far more successfully than the film itself and is equally (if not more) emotive – a ludicrous comparison but it’s telling that the little of the film that lingers in the memory was used to greater effect in the trailer.

‘Gatsby’ is a massively flawed film, and a long empty experience. It is nevertheless an interesting spectacle, obviously shaped with a deep affection for its visual styling – like the titular character it’s internally troubled, and painstakingly obsessed with presentation. Some good intentions lie in both of them somewhere, and for that they deserve attention.

I'll never forget watching the first gag in the first few seconds of the movie, where a shoddy puppet show is shown in close up, and I remember regretting pressing play. But when the camera zooms out to show that the puppet show is being operated by a marionette, and pans out further to display all of Paris abuzz with Pinocchios, that is when I realized that I was in for a treat.

Robert Zemeckis's newest effort, Flight starring Denzel Washington, is an interesting look at Flight disasters.

Struggling to compete with other cash-rich teams, the A’s seemingly have no other ambition than continuing to exist as a ball club. But this isn’t enough for Billy. Tired of being in touching distance of the World Series and continually losing their best players to bigger teams he looks to radically shake up the club’s structure and most importantly the signing of players – a task traditionally carried out by an ageing network of scouts who pick players based on their looks, height and the elegance of their throwing arm. After a chance encounter with Pete (Jonah Hill), a young Harvard economics graduate working for a rival team, he is spellbound by his numeric approach to the game and promptly hires him. Instead of relying on opinion and perceived notions of talent to recruit players, Pete has developed a system based entirely on their playing statistics to find value that other teams have missed – because they’re too old, use a bizarre throwing action or are carrying too much weight. As Pete puts it , “an island of misfit toys”. With this new concept in place Billy and Pete set about shaping a team for the new season, all the while facing fierce opposition from manager Art (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the scouting staff, and the media.

'Moneyball' has all the underdog sympathies that make for the best sports movies – but it has a wealth of other assets. The alien world of baseball management is made thoroughly accessible through the systematic approach, negating the need for any sporting knowledge; and seeing the team of outcasts fashioned from their stats is hugely satisfying in itself. Billy and Pete battle opposition from all around them and are exceptionally sympathetic as a result. It’s impossible not to root for them and become swept up in their unyielding determination. 

Beautifully shot by Wally Pfister (most noted for his work with Christopher Nolan) there are well lit vast monolithic stadiums filled with roaring fans, interspersed with TV footage and close up digital screens running with facts and figures – a real sense of what it is to be a modern day sports fan. It vividly breathes cinematic life into what is essentially a story of men talking about baseball – no mean feat.

In the end 'Moneyball' is not really a film about baseball at all. It’s more concerned with personal redemption and a willingness to adapt. Failed by the scouting system in his youth as a player, Billy has to fight his own demons as well as the antiquated traditions of the sport as he endeavours to introduce change. Pitt is exceptional as the short-tempered, charismatic Beane – presenting a believable everyman consumed by the job at hand. All the casting is excellent, with even the smallest roles clearly being given great consideration – and the A’s feel like a totally authentic, living ball club because of it. 

A spellbinding, affecting film that will have a special resonance for sports fans, accustomed to the heartbreak and anguish that goes with following the team you love – but the personal portrayal of one man’s resolve in the face of ceaseless hostility is where its real power lies.

There aren't many adjectives to describe Julian Schnabel's dazzling The Diving Bell and the Butterfly that really do it justice and it's honestly been a while since a movie last made me speechless. The initial response I usually have to this type of uplifting, inspirational film is one of sickening dread in anticipation of the upcoming tear-jerker, cynically exploiting a true story for quick cash. Schnabel, however obnoxious he had previously been, crafted a film of rare beauty and hard-hitting power that at one moment has you broken down in tears and in the next jumping fist-first in the air. With the performances of a lifetime, an intelligent script and breathtaking visuals from veteran cinematographer Kaminski and a true visionary on board in the form of Schnabel, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a truly wondrous, transcendental piece of film-making.

Without wanting to sound hyperbolic, this is the kind of movie that makes every single bad movie I've seen worth it. It's such a special, indescribably beautiful experience that it negates everything bad the medium has produced and really truly reminds me why it is I spend so much time with movies. Funnily enough it is this one that I'm struggling to write about and no matter what I say about it feels wrong in my eyes. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly manages to film the unfilmable and transports the viewer into the position of someone to whom one of the most unimaginably terrible things happened. It finds beauty in the simple things, makes you feel everything the protagonist feels, be it the initial fear and claustrophobia, the self-destructive pity following shortly and finally the acceptance of his state and the utterly inspiring will power. Schnabel created one of those rare moments in cinema, in the words of Kermode: a movie you don't just watch but actually sense, as if you can touch or taste it.

The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is such a rich and rewarding film it demands to be seen rather than read about in the review of an amateur critic. Do yourself a favour and get a copy of it, you won't regret it.

Rob Reiner these days is known for repulsively corny, “life-affirming” films, supposedly aimed at all audiences but personally I think they should be banned from ever being shown to anyone. He hasn't made a good movie in a very long time but in the 80's and into the early 90's he made a streak of films that are absolutely wonderful and although The Sure Thing is the weakest I've seen out of them it is still a very enjoyable watch. Starring the charming John Cusack and the lovely Daphne Zuniga on a road trip that reminds me of the beginning of When Harry Met Sally, meaning it is full of biting humor and a winning chemistry between the leads. It's nothing extraordinary nor original, but thanks to a good script and the much needed good performances works perfectly well.

Rom-Coms nowadays are 99% crap, so seeing one that is genuinely funny and engaging is really quite something. The Sure Thing is simply a delightful watch that may even surprise people expecting a by-the-numbers rom-com. Reiner had that spark during his early films that gave them exceedingly high levels of charm and this is no different. I wonder what happened that he suddenly decided to make pointless, witless crowd-pleasers, when even in his lesser earlier work there is a lot be found to like. The Sure Thing is by no means a classic but certainly worth a watch as I can't really see anyone not falling for it.

Often dubbed as one of the greatest films about film-making, Brian de Palma's Blow Out is a stylish and taut thriller. It stars John Travolta, still on the rise at the time, Nancy Allen and the always reliable John Lithgow, along with an interesting premise which merges Antonioni's Blowup with Coppola's The Conversation. Whereas Coppola's work was rather conventional in the visual department (I can't comment on Blowup since I haven't seen it), de Palma's film is quite experimental and features some brilliantly inventive shots, as well as an interesting colour palette that focuses on stark reds. Brian de Palma always makes visually interesting films but this may very well be his greatest in that area and repeatedly had me smile as it must've been a blast to shoot.

The central performances are excellent and carry a little of that B-Movie vibe I so often notice in said director's films. Although a fairly dark flick it doesn't take itself too seriously, but in a way that doesn't diminish the thrill. Brian de Palma successfully merged a Hitchcockian thriller with his own stylistic trademarks and seductive aesthetics. It owes a lot to many directors but Blow Out is a film that stands on its own merits, despite some levels of camp. The final line is both hilarious and creepy at the same time and contains exactly the right mix of both to work as closure of what is essentially a B-Movie given the higher budget treatment. Very memorable and a brilliant ride through film-making itself.

So Hoop Dreams (1994) is a wildly ambitious documentary that follows the lives of two inner-city Chicago teens (over the span of five years) who both dream of one day entering the NBA. Both of them seem untouchably talented and capable in their own right, but the movie is just under three hours of growing up with them through their formative and difficult high school years--watching their egos ebb and flow, seeing their defeats and triumphs impact who they become. It's not only a foray into the intensely competitive, stratified world of high school basketball, but also into the struggle of two families to stay together through financial and emotional problems. 

I was really amazed by this film. I don't think I've seen something that so broadly encapsulates what it is to be human--to hope, to fall and recover, to change, to look after one's family. The lives of these real people are much more dramatic than I've seen in any fiction film.

I feel like I've missed so much by not knowing about Chan-wook Park's work. 
Let me say, I was quite impressed with this movie. 
The opening scene made my jaw drop with this beautifully written India's monologue:

 [""My ears hear what others cannot hear; small faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me. These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing, longing to be rescued, to be completed. Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow, I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone. I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse, and shoes which are from my uncle. This is me. Just as a flower does not choose its color, we are not responsible for what we have come to be. Only once you realize this do you become free, and to become adult is to become free."" ](/spoiler) 

that even stopped me from eating my popcorn and focusing on her words, beautiful directing and editing.


The movie itself has a slow plot development, but because of it's multiple layers it's so immersing. The wonderful thing about it is that you cannot stop yourself from analyzing characters and I felt good for India because 

[even though she ended up in a very bad place which she was probably destined for, she actually made a good choice by killing Charlie and showed that despite her twisted nature, her mind wasn't poluted. I was surprised to see that she was actually smarter and braver than she appeared because she was able to cut down her needs in order to prevent a really, really bad thing from happening and going far away from her ''home''.](/spoiler).

Young auctioneer's assistant Simon (James McAvoy) aids a gang of thieves led by Frank (Vincent Cassel) to steal a Goya painting just sold by his auction house for £25m. A blow to the head during the plan causes partial amnesia and he fails to remember where he concealed the artwork while escaping. After withstanding Frank’s brutal torture the gang eventually buy his story – and contact a Harley Street hypnotist, Dr Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) to help him recall its location. In trying to assist Simon, Elizabeth unravels a dark world of confusion and deceit locked in his head, leaving him with no grasp on his reality.

Despite a strong opening that hints at a rollicking criminal caper, it falters and miscues for much of the first hour, losing all the momentum initially created. The mystery of the vanished painting isn’t particularly compelling and fades in significance as the film wraps itself in Simon’s twisted, layered psyche. The cast of characters are uniformly untrustworthy and not notably likeable so without a strong driving narrative it's difficult to invest much in them – especially as they’re all fairly flat - and for much of ‘Trance’ the events taking place aren’t sufficiently engaging either. However, well shot and put together, it almost conjures up enough pleasure to override this. Drawing an unusual stylistic portrait of modern London that parallels slick glass apartments with grimy clubs and back alleys – tinted with a recurring palette of orange, blue and red alongside frequent nods to classic noir – it’s an enjoyable world to be swept up in. A pounding electronic soundtrack culled straight from the 90s does much to keep things exhilarating and moving along – totally over the top, the intense music is frequently more interesting than the action on screen. The mysteries and unknowns should make every frame riveting: however, the film shifts around and ties so many knots keeping up becomes tiresome, and solving the various riddles feels futile. 

When ‘Trance’ eventually kicks into gear in the final third it atones for an entirely forgettable start, shaping itself into a ludicrous, violent, dark ride - a tonal shift that isn’t really in keeping but at least some ‘stuff’ is happening. Utterly implausible and verging on unfathomable, it ramps up the sex, violence and deceit beyond belief – seemingly pleased to leave the plot to one side and simply have some gratuitous visceral fun. A chaotic mess that just about hangs together, it still has enough shallow pleasures to leave you satisfied – if a little baffled as to what the hell you just watched.

As you've no doubt previously read, the creator of this sub /u/ARS_ is currently deployed to Afghanistan and before leaving added me and /u/DaedalusMinion as moderators as they weren't able to give the sub the attention it deserved. 

As a result, between us, and in response to feedback, we've made some changes over the last few months. I don't think these have been drastic changes, namely, they are:

-	Removing one-line reviews and [giving some guidance on reviewing]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/19smw3/mod_reminder_post_content_in_your_reviews_we_are/)
-	Asking for [IMDB links in all submissions]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1bbsdk/mod_post_imdb_links_need_to_be_included_in_all/)
-	Adding to the sidebar that all submissions need to include the year (as stated on IMDB)

Unfortunately we are still spending most of our time on the sub asking people to include an IMDB link (despite changing the submission bar to have a red ‘include an IMDB’ box). We get several reports of incorrect submissions flagged by users each day. Stating the year of the film is becoming increasingly relevant due to numerous film re-makes. Frankly, we’d rather spend our moderating time being more useful to the sub than simply repeating the same set of words over and over again. 

So the Autobot will filter out reviews which don’t include the film year and an IMDB link and it will automatically send them to the spam filter. Now, a user did point out that with certain genres of film (for example some Anime or Korean cinema) won’t be listed on IMDB. And that is fine; try to find an equivalent or some source of other review forum to link to within your own review, and we can and will manually release them from the spam filter. Between us, that probably gets checked four times a day.

Wow, what an amazing film. I can't believe I haven't seen it before, I now understand a lot of references from random stuff I've seen over the internet! 

Set in 1947 - 
it's about a guy (Andy) who works in a bank and is sent to Shawshank Prison (which is corrupt) for supposedly murdering his wife. After a month, Andy makes a few friends, his main one being 'Red'. As Red is 'the guy who can get things', he asks him for a rock hammer, a tool he claims he needs for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting. 

Over the course of a few years, Andy works in the laundry part of the prison and doesn't like it. Red and his friends manage to get them a job working on the roof. They overhear one of the guards (Hadely) on the roof talking about taxes on an inheritance he's about to get (about 30k). Andy bravely walks over to the guard and tells him if he gives it to his wife as a one time gift, the IRS cannot deduct taxes from it, as this is a rule the IRS have. Though Hadely at first threatens to throw Andy off the roof, he agrees, providing the men with cold beer before the job is finished. 

Word gets round that Andy is highly knowledgeable about taxes and he subsequently ends up doing the taxes for most of the guards, including the warden. He makes a good name for himself around the prison. He eventually gets allocated as a library assistant, as the warden thinks he is too educated to to manual work. 

This is where the film gets very interesting and I highly recommend it. It became one of my all-time favourites. I'd give it a solid 9/10.

I want to start by saying that I love korean films and since I discoverd Oldboy I got dragged into it but for some reasons I just forgot that it was a part of ""The Vengeance Trilogy"".

Going into Chan-wook Parks movie I expected some Oldboy mindfuck ending and because of that i was a little disappointed but I can still say this movie was truly great. I learned at the end that the only thing these 3 movies have in common is the theme: the vengeance.

The violence, shocking, disturbing scenes and the never ending twists created an intense connection between me and the movie that I cannot say about alot of movies. There was always something that kept the suspense going and amplifying it at the same time. I can't say the movie is unpredictable but everytime something happens, it somehow comes as a shocker and makes you think about it. 
Another great thing about this movie is that, in my opinion, there are no bad and good characters. Everyone has its reasons for their actions and you don't have the right to contest their decisions.

Overall, another great korean movie by Chan-wook Park, showing yet again the greatness of the korean cinematography. 

My rating:9/10

Following the Avatar formula of big named cast + big effects budget + 3D - Plot and character development = $$$$$, this movie had me saying ""I can't believe how bad this is,"" multiple times out loud in the theatre. Now I wasn't baked so that might have had something to do with it but this movie is literally all flash and no substance. A star studded cast can't save the script from sounding like it was supposed to be 4 hours and was gutted by 50%. I swear, the screenwriters were even including references to their own struggle to make this mess of a movie somehow resolve ASAP. Deus Ex Machinas are the only thing that drives this movie to finally (and mercifully) end.


If you're going to go see this movie I recommend taking drugs, otherwise it's going to get boring. Honestly, this movie is the Birdemic of Hollywood Blockbusters. My favourite part was that Zack Braff is only onscreen for 2 minutes tops and plays James Franco's little bitch assistant. Knowing that he wouldn't show up later in the film despite his top billing made me chuckle to myself. There were still a few other good laughs and it is an overall enjoyable watch if you don't mind bad movies.

Also, you need to go into it expecting more of a road documentary than a comedy. There are really funny parts, but it's much more about this massive tour and Conan's need to make people happy than it is about being packed with laughs.

As expected from a Pixar movie, it was friggin awesome. It had it's aww moments along with it's battles. It was pretty well written but the overall movie was a bit lackluster.

On the one hand I *really* wanted to like it (great cast, interesting premise), on the other thre reviews were mediocre so I wasn't too hopeful.

As it is it really was just ok. The good:

* The direction (as you would expect from the director of Atonement) and cinematography. It looks good, the scenes are coherent, the action flows well and there's not too much of the quick cutting that is de rigeur in fight sequences these days.
* The performances, all of which are solid, and Hanna herself is a well-portrayed mix of confused fragility and hard-as-nails. Tom Hollander especially, who is not in it much but is playing well against type.


The Bad:

* The action. There is nowhere near enough of it. We very, very rarely see Hanna cut loose - and when she does it is thrilling, but she spends almost the entire film running away from people she's repeatedly proved she could just kill with her bare hands. I expected a more serious version of Hit Girl, and got Forrest Gump instead. A film like this needs ebb and flow, it needs to hit certain beats to be satisfying, and very few of the action sequences came close - it never, ever lives up to the promise of the first act. Once Hanna fights her way out of detention she never reaches that level again - it needed to build to a crescendo, but instead it tails off and keeps tailing.
* The accents - Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana give decent performances, but I did find the fake accents quite distracting. 
* The music. On its own, I like it, but in context it is just too hyperactive for the strangely muted and inadequate action.
* The end. I get what they were trying to do, but because of the inconsistent action I didn't think the payoff was earned, so it rang strangely hollow.

**(caution: spoilers)**

**Beautiful Cinematography**

-A visual masterpiece; like a dreamy, surreal state that flows with the operatic movement of the characters, complete with seamless scene transitions. 

-Mesmerizing dance sequences.

-Loved how everything was filmed in that one theater, and according to imdb, how the only character that had scenes outside is Levin because he’s the only one living a “real” life

-Which fits with the theme of the Russian aristocracy living their lives until close scrutiny of the public eye portrayed by the play-like format

**Poor Reception**

-Didn’t read the novel, but I get why this adaption was poorly received.

-Similar to the Russian aristocrats themselves, the stylization/look of the film is visually appetizing but the underlying message of the film is, well, pretty shallow. 

-Also, its the same old message of the unfair/cruel societal standards towards women.

-But maybe that was the point, idk.

**Plot Issues**

-The trailer gives away the best of the dialogue and it’s hyped up to be more dramatic than it really was, when few interesting shakeups happen plot wise.

-Wish Anna’s husband, Levin/Kitty, and even Anna’s brother had more to do- in the latter half, they felt shoved to the side.

-The foreshadowing of Anna’s death is unforgivably obvious, after that you have a hunch that’s pretty much how it’ll end for either Anna or Vronsky. Perhaps if it was less subtle?

-Perhaps they could have explained/shown why Anna would want to cheat on Alexi (before the affair) as well as introduce signs of her insanity earlier in the film. 

-However at the end of the day, if it was trying to be faithful to the source material, you can’t really blame it- it’s difficult to adapt literary work with a lot of minor important inner thoughts/ideas/details.

**Other thoughts**

-Joe Wright always uses Kiera, so it would have been cool to have seen someone unexpected like Helena Bonham Carter play Anna.

**Overall**- Would pay $7/10 to see it in theaters (for the visuals again)

TL;DR:  Waaaaay too long, but the music was magnificent. So what the theater.

The movie is five and a half hours long, not counting 2 intermissions and a break for a meal. It was directed by Abel Gance, who has a small roll in it. Get this: it's the first of a 6-part story of Napoleon; needless to say, none of the other five parts got made.

The first part has some fascinating camera techniques that could not be duplicated for decade after sound came in. The cameras tracked galloping horsed from stirrup-level, rider-level, and more levels than I can remember. There were several scenes filmed from a camera mounted on a cannon as it fired and recoiled. Absolutely daring and incredible. 

Gance's editing was also brilliant and new. There were several scenes where he cut people's faces into one long shot of faceafterfaceafterfaceafterface, showing reactions to some events. I considered it very effective at hammering home the feelings of the people who lived the events. It reminded me of Eisenstein's theory of montage, illustrated in his ""Battleship Potemkin."" It reminded me of Quentin's story in ""Absalom, Absalom!"" when he visited Miss Coldfield who's wisteria was in ""the savage quiet September sun impacted distilled and hyperdistilled."" Gance was brilliant and showing emotion and having us feel it with the characters.

However, the movie was too long. The acting was more nearly histrionic that I would have preferred: much clutching at breasts, arm-raising to the sky, kneeling in abject whatever. This was a style of acting, but it was passe in the US, where a more natural style had taken over by the time ""Napoleon"" was released here. (I recommend comparing the acting in Napoleon with that in ""Mating Call,"" for example. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mating_Call_(film) )

There were _many_ scenes that were breathtaking. The camera work with the galloping horses, for example, but also static shots of horizons under lowering clouds with a white dot of sun shining through and lighting the land as we watch Napoleon fleeing Corsica, chased by his would-be assassins. I much prefer the camera work of silent films to talkies because the directors could compose static shots with all the artfulness of master photographers, and we get many of those scenes where Napoleon stands in dramatic splendor.

Ultimately, though, the movie has to stand on its main character, and as the first of six parts, ""Napoleon"" fails to make it a dramatic story, in spite of all the considerable drama going on in France in the early days of Napoleon's life. The problem, for me, is that the movie makes one point: Napoleon was at his best when fighting against insurmountable odds. That's all we learn about him. But the point is made over and over and over. The movie is a hagiography of Napoleon, where he seems to bloom full-talented as a child and never changes. People wilt at his stare from his pre-teen years. And he goes on staring until the end of this movie as he invades Italy. 

The movie is _much_ more interesting to me technically than as a story. Gance used techniques that stand up to today's computer-generated graphics. The fast-paced editing in some scenes foretells MTV edit styles, and he used three interlocked cameras to film the last section of the movie, the invasion of Italy, because the spectacle could not fit on one screen, decades ahead of Cinerama.

His action with the camera was also decades ahead of its time. He used hand-held cameras in battle scenes to show us the jumble and confusion of war, superimposed many scenes to show us again the jumble and confusion of war but also to illustrate all the ideas going on in Napoleon's mind. I have never seen the camera so well-used as in this movie. (""Rashomon"" comes to mind, but in that movie I saw the camera as a character in the film. In ""Napoleon,"" the camera is a means to show us the action, not a part of the film itself.) I'll be checking to see what else cinematographer Jules Kruger has done.

I saw ""Napoleon"" in Oakland's Paramount Theatre, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Theatre_(Oakland,_California) , and I recommend reading about it in the Wikipedia page. The gallery of photos provides a very brief view of how wonderful the theater is. The music during the movie was provided by the Oakland East Bay Symphony, conducted by Carl Davis, the composer of the music. The music was magnificent, timed to the events in the movie. An excellent perfromance

I suspect you'll never get to see the movie. From one point of view, you won't miss much: if you think of the movie as a movie, it's not all that great. However, you'll miss the incredible talents of the director, the cinematographer, and the composer/conductor. The movie itself is too much of its time, in my humble opinion, but the creation of it has not been surpassed in terms of technique, editing, and cinematography. I'd put Abel Gance in the same league as Fritz Lang, two men well ahead of their time. Like Richard Kelly, Gance,  was unable to bring his vision successfully to the screen and is no longer remembered. Lang, however, was very successful commercially as well as artistically.

I have a few photos of the interior of the theater and a video of the thunderous ovation for the composer and the heads of restoration of the film [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/civex/sets/72157629726506227/).",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_rq82t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/rq82t/ijw_napoleon_1927/,

This film is no exception, though it would be fair to say that the ""confusion"" quotient is a greater part of this Lynch mixture than the ""awe"" bit.

Half the movie was basically a shot of Laura Dern looking *really* confused.

I thought her performance in this film was wonderful. Yes she did look confused a lot, but she was also very angry at times and also cried a bit. I just wish I knew exactly why she was angry or sad. Laura Dern looking confused was nothing compared to me being confused.

Jeremy's Iron was also in the film and generally looked happy. That's about as much as I could say about him.

Harry Dean Stanton did quite well as the Assistant Director with no money who kept scamming members of the cast and crew to get some. He didn't spend much time doing this, or in the film generally. But it was nice to see him contributing to something I suppose.

Justin Theroux did a really good job of being sleezy. His character disappears halfway through the film though.

Grace Zabriskie also did a good job as a very confusing Gypsy.

And, of course, the anthropomorphic rabbits were very funny, if the response of the studio audience is anything to go by.

The hand-held cheap digital camera work was interesting. I enjoyed thinking about just how cheap good technology is these days and wondering just how cheap a good film can be made now. And I did this while watching the film because, well, my brain wanted to latch on to something that it was able to logically deconstruct, unlike the film.

I loved Penelope Cruz's character, I think she was amazing and she was able to do everything she does best (including look incredible), but it  didn't make the film on its own, especially since she's not on the screen all the time. I was less pleased with the mother coming back storyline and especially the murdered husband - husband gets killed, they clean up and hide the body, and that's it. More or less forgotten about during the rest of the film. No repercussions, no almost discoveries, no meditation on guilt and fear, no big emotions at all. After the first act the husband is hidden and it moves on to another storyline. Weird.

I did find it interesting that Amoldovar's tendency to focus on female characters was so incredibly exaggerated. There isn't a male character in the whole film with more than a couple of lines to say. The male character closest to the main characters is the husband and he's stabbed to death early on, as if to say ""don't worry! I got the last of them!"" Of course the reason Amoldovar does this is that he's so good at doing women characters and he's more interested in them, and the film didn't suffer for it.

Both times I saw it in Spanish, the first time was with French subtitles and the second was with Spanish subtitles. I enjoyed it more the second time, probably because it feels very culturally Spanish.

Starring:  Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester 

Review: I know I'm going get some flack for this review I but I'm cool with that. To begin, before I watched the movie (and before I watch any older film) I check what year it was made in so I can adjust my mind into what it would have been like to view this film amongst the others of its time. This helps me appreciate a lot of older films instead of comparing them to what comes out now. 

With that said I began my viewing and was completely blown  away by the sound, the visuals, *EVERY* set, the costumes, the space ship scenes,  and the cinematography etc. I kept trying to figure out how they filmed the different gravity scenes without actually being in space. At one point I gave up and just decided to enjoy it. I could go on for days about the movie visually and praise it until there was nothing left to praise but I will go on to the negatives.

The *entire* 2 hours and 40 minutes I spent watching it I had not a clue what was really happening. The dialogue left a lot to be desired. I didn't need him to spell it out for me and I knew the whole point of the movie was the mystery behind the black monolith(after the ape scene) but every single time they changed who they were covering as the main character I couldn't help but feel like they were intentionally trying to frustrate me. This to say the least made my viewing very unpleasant. But still I trekked on hoping that it would all make sense at the end. What happened was the movie got more confusing after [Hal went crazy and was shut off. I realized something had happened to Dave and he was aging at a rapid rate but I had no idea what was going on especially after what felt like years of the acid trip scene.](/spoiler) 

Needless to say I was unhappy that the movie ended without an explanation and that I now had to look up what I had just watched for the last 3 hours. To me that was the unsuccessful part of the movie. It was so ridiculously long(i'll get to this) and to have the viewer not be able to understand a movie with more than enough time and obvious technique was ludicrous.

The length to me was tiresome. I'm all for a 3 hour movie and I actually prefer long movies with plots that take time to fully flesh out but this movie had really long sequences that dragged. The sequences inside the spaceships were aesthetically pleasing and the ending sequence with Dave [in the room aging](/spoiler) was especially gripping but every long sequence before and after that were tedious and boring. Especially the dawn of man one and the ones in outer space. I do know the pacing was done to create and sustain the eerie atmosphere he was going for but the movie would have been able to do that without the literal 9 minute [acid trip scene.](/spoiler) I guess I just expected more dialogue and what not in a almost 3 hour movie. 

All in all I rate the movie a 8 for amazing graphics, sets, music, cinematography and editing especially for 1968 but I won't be watching this again.

Al Pacino gives a fantastic performance all the way through, especially towards the end where he's all sleep deprived and ruined. It's gripping, well shot and tightly made. Robin Williams manages to be incredibly friendly yet you still hate his character for reasons that will become obvious during the film. I'll need to see the original to compare and contrast, and it strikes me that although Nolan directed, he wasn't brought on until late in the process, like Duncan Jones in Source Code.

I highly recommend.

This actually isn't true and it's only ""presented by"" Quentin Tarantino.

Now this movie is written by, screenplay done by, staring and directed by RZA. This isn't automatically a bad thing. It could have been a work of genius and brilliance... but it wasn't.

I will admit that the first 3/5 of the movie were quite well done though his acting was... well, could you even say he acted? Other than that it flowed well and had an interesting story line. It's only after the first 3/5 that we get to the heart of what this movie really is. A self indulgent pile of crap that not even Russell Crow, Lucy Liu, Dave Batista and Rick Yune couldn't save. Also... why on earth did they sign up for this? 

Russell hamed his way through the thing. Lucy seemed to quite enjoy her roll even if she over played it. Batista seemed to... well it seemed as if he had some work for once. And Rick... why of why Rick. The lack of directing really hurt his acting. The scenes in the credits were some of the worst and seemed completely added on as a last thought.

I could go on but you really need to see if for yourself.

I give this 2.5 out of 5.

As the distant planet Krypton begins to self-destruct after over-mining of its core, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his infant child to Earth to give him a chance at life, and to guide the people of Earth away from Kryptonian mistakes. Discovered by Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane) he is raised as their own son and given the name Clark, but thanks to his physiology and a weaker Earth atmosphere he soon discovers his superhuman powers. After eventually being told of his miraculous appearance on the planet, Clark dedicates his life to finding answers. Beginning to understand his origins, it’s not a moment too soon as the merciless General Zod (Michael Shannon) threatens life on Earth in order to get to Clark – who he sees as the Kryptonians' only chance of rebuilding their race.

There is much to admire in ‘Man of Steel’ - which only proves to make the final incoherent experience even more frustrating. The story isn’t so much told as depicted in a collection of set-pieces and disjointed scenes, making for an exceptional series of trailers but leaving the film uninvolving, and consequently dull. Within these fractured moments there are flashes of brilliance capable of regaining interest levels as the plot drifts around, so it’s unfair to condemn it completely. 

The production design and visual effects are remarkable. Although not breaking any new ground, some beautiful details bring the Kryptonian world and inhabitants to life. Everything feels solid with a tangible weight so, despite a heavy reliance on digital effects, fight sequences and action have real impact. The relentless battles do grow tiresome as the film’s climax wears on, but one small scale fight in the streets of Smallville is near perfect in its inventiveness and execution.

The casting is also spot on, none more so than Cavill who truly is Superman, bringing some depth to the troubled young man who must come to terms with his identity and destiny. There isn’t much for him or any of the cast to get their teeth into, but there are plenty of competent standalone scenes that provide a degree of emotional involvement. ‘Man of Steel’ is ultimately about fathers and sons and, despite lumbering storytelling, the relationship between Cavill and Costner has something touchingly honest about it. In general there's little fun to be had. The outrageous supernatural events are taken deadly seriously and such an outlook becomes wearisome - this isn’t an intelligent enough film to justify its po-face. A few touches of lightness or humour would certainly make the chaos more palatable.

Ultimately ‘Man of Steel’ is a huge event film that ‘has’ to be seen, and although it’s little more than an awkward melange of moments that feels like glimpsing at half-formed ideas from other blockbusters, the spectacle is still impressive and within this swirling mess almost everything is well-handled.

Zac Snyder's *Man of Steel* is a reboot of the Superman franchise produced by Christopher Nolan. Clark Kent goes on a journey of self-discovery while General Zod, a Kryptonian general, comes to Earth searching for him.

If you don't want any spoilers, my opinion of this film is less than positive. I really didn't like it. The very, very small amount of positives don't outweigh the lame characters and plot holes. I was genuinely disappointed, being a fan of Nolan's Batman trilogy as well as Snyder's *Watchmen*, *300*, and even *Sucker Punch*. 

Now, here's the spoiler filled review:

[First, what I like about this movie. The action scenes were awesome! The fights in Smallville and in Metropolis were quite intense and fun to watch.](/spoiler)

[The other thing I liked about this movie was General Zod. He is my favorite kind of villain; someone who does villainous things but not out of a want for power or for the sake of evil, but for the greater good. Ozymandias from *Watchmen* is a prime example of this kind of villain. And that's about all I liked about the film.](/spoiler)

[The characters, except for General Zod, were forgettable and bland. Even Lois Lane, a girl who is known for her attitude and drive to get the story, is watered down and uninteresting in this movie. Aside from finding out who Clark actually was, she served little to no purpose other than to be a love interest in a forced romance. I actually hated Clark's Earth father and didn't feel anything when he died (it's not good for a character when he suggests that Clark should have let some kids drown in a bus in the *first* scene he's in). His death was a stupid scene, anyway.](/spoiler)

[Another big problem I had with this movie was lack of development for Clark. One of the most important aspects of him was his moral compass. He is a force for good and would go out of his way to save a life. And you would think that in an origin story, time would be taken to establish this compass. But no. Never in this movie is there a scene which he establishes his distaste for killing or letting others be killed. So when he kills Zod in the end choosing to end his life to save the lives of a family of four who could easily get away, it just feels silly when he cries in agony at what he has done. What's more, the *very* next scene is comedic and it seems he's forgotten all about it. For doing something that caused him so much pain, they gave him no time to think on it especially since they never established his moral compass.](/spoiler)

[The movie also suffers from plot holes. A few that stood out to me was how in the hell did he hitchhike himself to the Arctic and convince all of those people he was part of the excavation team?  Why didn't Pa Kent send Clark, who is invincible, to save the dog from the freak tornado that came absolutely out of nowhere in a few seconds?  If the Kryptonians went out and settled on so many other planets in the universe, why do the Kryptonians feel the need to control their population? And in the end, the military *knows who he is*! So how are they having a hard time finding where he lives? There are many others that destroyed my investment in the story and ruined it for me.](/spoiler)

So, I really did not like this movie. I was very disappointed in Snyder and Nolan for failing to make a good Superman movie, especially with their successes with the Batman trilogy and *Watchmen*. I applaud them for trying to make it dark, but they went about it the wrong way.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1hdkua,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1hdkua/ijw_man_of_steel_2013/,

I went into Despicable Me 2 with some really high hopes; after all, its prequel was (and remains) one of my all time favourite animated features. 

Despicable Me 2 see's everyone's favourite villein (Gru) team up with a team of Anti-Villein's to bring down a plot to..(OK I'm not sure why). Anyway, hilarity ensues. 

Or not. Maybe I'd built this film up to a level it couldn't possibly hope to reach, but after 45 minutes I'd already checked out. The storyline is essentially none existent for the first half of the film; and by the time things started to move forward, i'd lost interest. As for the comedy? Its certainly there, however if you've seen the trailers, you've probably seen the best of what's on offer. 

I'm wary of being to hard on this film, especially after seeing so many good reviews online; but for me it just didn't land. I can see young kids enjoying it for 90 or so minutes, but if you're after something a little more involving, its not here.

2/5

I would like to say that this remake of the Pang Brothers' 1999 Thai language film was an example of Hollywood, specifically Nic Cage's production company, taking a foreign language film and improving it whilst making it more appealing to an English speaking audience. I would like to, but I cannot. Instead it is a *Le Dîner de Cons/Dinner for Schmucks* type fiasco. Key facets of the original, the assassin being a deaf mute and hence unflinching was changed because Cage wanted lines and it was his production company paying. [Instead the local he falls for is made deaf mute, entirely shifting their relationship.](/spoiler)

The story itself is uninspired, [a professional hitman betraying his personal code for locals he comes to care about](/spoiler). Almost the entire film is poorly lit and very little characterisation occurs, I found it difficult to care about any of the characters.

As the film limps to its inevitable conclusion all I felt was a sense of relief that it was over, rather than enjoyment. I wouldn't recommend it, even if someone is a die hard Cage fan. What kept me going through the first act was the same morbid fascination that causes people to slow down when passing car crashes, it was only 100 minutes long but felt far longer. Not good, not average, not so bad it's good, just bad.

I would rate this film 3/10",,False,,t5_2rafo,1371500489.0,,,True,t3_1gidly,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1gidly/ijw_bangkok_dangerous_2008/,

The Man Who Fell to Earth is a film that could only have been made in the 70s. Nic Roeg's strange and surreal Sci-Fi poses more questions than it answers, and when it does answer it's through suggestion and images, rarely does it explain anything using dialogue. After an alien – disguised as David Bowie – crash-lands on earth in search for water to presumably bring back home to his family, who is dying of thirst during a terrible drought, he ends up staying far longer than he had planned. To build his spacecraft he founds a corporation, presumably based on highly advanced technology already in use on his planet, and amasses staggering amounts of wealth and economical power. Of course, such huge success in a short period of time raises some eyebrows and things get complicated for him.

Roeg is a master at cinematic crafts and The Man Who Fell to Earth is no exception, sporting astounding visuals, especially during the sections taking place in the vast deserts of New Mexico, as well as creative editing. The disjointed, cut-up narrative walks the fine line between coherent and confusing with utmost precision, resulting in a picture that requires full attention from its audiences. Although not a whole lot happens explicitly within the 2 hours and 20 minutes, the strange, otherworldly, and occasionally extremely creepy atmosphere that lingers over the screen makes this secretive, low-key Sci-Fi film compelling and gives it an alluring quality.

Roeg proves once more to be one of the most interesting and versatile directors of his time with a hugely atmospheric genre film, and the confident direction of a master film-maker.

The 2008 film based on part of the life of the Argentine doctor and revolutionary Che Guevara during the Cuban revolution. Che is played very well by Benicio Del Toro (who looks very much like him). 

The film spans 3 timelines but this does not get confusing, one is 1955 in Mexico and is used very little, at the beginning and the end of the film, this is based around a meal and talk Che would have when he met Fidel, the second and most important is the revolution from 1956 until January 1st 1959 the third and inter-spaced during the film in black and white is 1964 where he is interviewed and speaks in front of the UN.

The film is of course in Spanish and this adds to the action, and plenty of action there is, with it being a war film of course. Along with lots of talking, it is fast paced as it takes in two years of revolution, much of which was spent walking around mountains and laying in wait to ambush the army.

One of the best parts of the film is the [derailing of a train in Santa Clara, for which they actually derailed a train and had one take to get it right](/spoiler)

The film is good and I am biased as this is the area of History I specialise in but it gives a good overview of why the revolution was a success and why the people were happy for it to happen and gave help to the revolutionaries. It does not examine the politics behind Che, a film to cover this would take much longer than the 134 minutes in this.

Overall I would give it 8 out of 10.  Some of the subtitles are translated slightly wrong, these being the more fruity language but that is understandable. And yes there is a Che: Part Two that I will do another day.

I watched this movie with my family yesterday. We were after something pleasant to watch with good action and a good fun and that's what we got.

The good bits were obviously seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger again. The other cast was also quite good. We have a relatively good setup at the start of the movie as it switches between the two settings (police vs county) which ultimately converge. 

There is a bit of unnecessary gore in most of the action sequences in my opinion. Lots and lots of blood and flying limbs. But, I guess it adds to the style of the movie.  

There's a bit of comedy and there also some semi-serious moments that don't just brush through death but show it fully. It makes it feel a little more real (compared to the new Die hard movie that had no thoughts on death at all).

The end sequence is fantastic and was really happy with the ending. Good old style, action shoot em up fun. 

It was kind of like an old western movie come to think of it.

Malcolm (Ty Hickson) and his tomboy best friend Sophia (Tashiana Washington) spend their days graffiti-writing and sticker-bombing the city. Never receiving the recognition they deserve they hatch a harebrained scheme to tag a massive novelty apple at the Mets baseball stadium – so everyone will know the names Shakes and Sophia. But needing $500 to pay off the ground security they set about begging, borrowing and stealing to get the cash together in time – running into various scrapes as they individually meet up with old friends and new faces along the way.

At 81mins this is an incredibly short film, but every one of those minutes is an absolute joy. Less about the drive to get the money, first time writer/director Adam Leon is more concerned with portraying engaging likeable characters and observing friendship during the awkwardness of adolescence. The pursuit of the cash is enough to keep motivations running, but it’s the characters and their relationships and interactions that make the experience so compelling. Humour effortlessly flows from the unaffected dialogue, making each scene warm and genuinely funny. Hickson and Washington are both incredibly natural, and share a chemistry that is blissful to watch. Fast talking, tripping over words and trading some exceptionally realistic digs with each other, the pair feel every bit lifelong friends. The support cast are equally adept, with newcomer Meeko as hispanic miscreant Champion getting many of the biggest laughs.

It’s refreshing to see an inner-city drama that isn’t a one dimensional morality tale told with lazy negative caricatures. Equally remarkable is how uncliched ‘Gimme The Loot’ feels, considering it features all the stereotyped ingredients of ‘street culture’ – basketball, graffiti, drugs – but thanks to the warmth and consideration shown to the characters it is transformed into a tender, sincere story that subverts expectations. Shot with a lo-fi aesthetic in sun-bleached pastel shades, ‘Gimme The Loot’ captures a sweltering summer's day in the city beautifully – again, it’s nice to see urban authenticity that isn’t just gritty and grim. The soundtrack is an equally uplifting mix of soul and hip-hop, encapsulating the breezy laid-back mood. A wonderful, sweet-natured, human film that passes by as quickly as youth – but leaves the same joyful, hazy memories.

Smooth talking prolific bank robber Jack Foley (Clooney) crosses paths with tough federal agent Karen Sisco (Lopez) while breaking out of prison. He and his accomplice Buddy (Ving Rhames) overpower her and they are driven to freedom – but are locked in the boot together. Sharing such a confined space for hours they develop an unlikely attraction both are unwilling to admit. Parting company, Karen is tasked with capturing Jack and returning him to prison. Meanwhile Jack is tangled up with ex-boxer and vicious criminal Maurice Miller (Don Cheadle) in the pursuit of a huge store of uncut diamonds he heard about inside. Unable to quell their attraction, Jack and Karen struggle to keep focus on the jobs in front of them.

‘Out of Sight’ has so much more going for it than most run-of-the-mill manhunt movies. Director Steven Soderbergh has a real understanding of a vast spectrum of genres and is able to call on them with great effect here. The generally lighthearted tone makes it great fun, but it doesn’t skimp on the action or drama – there are even hints of romantic comedy, and by virtue of Soderbergh’s confidence and consistency everything melds together seamlessly into an enjoyable, solid thriller. This erratic mood distinctively sets the film apart and keeps the journey unpredictable – as the expected formula is continually subverted, we have a vague idea of where we’re heading but the twists and turns are well concealed. Told partially with flashbacks it’s far more engaging, and ultimately satisfying, than it might have been, creating a continued degree of intrigue as the past and present narratives begin to click together. 

Much relies on the chemistry between Clooney and Lopez, who share a genuine electricity. Without their sparkling attraction many of the film’s best scenes would fall flat. Clooney turns in a fine performance as George Clooney, endlessly likeable and charming as the gentleman bank robber, and Lopez is surprisingly adept as the ballsy FBI agent – not a role you’d classically imagine her in.

Overtly a blockbuster, but executed with an unusual flair that shares much with art-house cinema, it has more merit than the box art and A-star cast would suggest. With a dynamic structure, curious tone and characteristically for Soderbergh’s work fantastically well shot, it employs a bold colour palette that lends all the locations their own identity. An unorthodox, vastly enjoyable crime flick with real personality and intelligence.

After being disappointed by Dead Poets Society I had doubts whether or not I was right about Peter Weir as a director, all of which quickly vaporized after last night's viewing of the fantastic The Mosquito Coast, based on the novel of the same name. The film goes back to everything I like so much about the director, be it the extraordinary sense of setting or the intricate characterizations, there is much to like about this adaptation. Of course, not having read the novel I can't make any comparisons and state whether it is truthful to it, but it also gives me the opportunity to judge it solely as a film. Weir's keen eye for the world around the characters and the way he shoots his films in a very natural way allows for the jungle to create a real sense of isolation and claustrophobia. While Mosquitia is seemingly paradise at the beginning, things start going very wrong very fast. Although the threat appears to come from the outside it becomes clear after a while what the true source of the many troubles is. The way the jungle and later on the river cause a special case of insanity and megalomaniac tendencies in the central characters reminds me slightly of Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Apocalypse Now. Allie Fox was never a particularly stable man as the start of the film indicates, but only when he reaches Mosquitia do we get to see his real character.

Weir's films have always been about the characters and the way they interact in new, unknown or different worlds. In Witness for instance, a city cop ends up in an Amish village, here it is an eccentric inventor from the US in the jungle of central Africa. His being there initially leads to the re-building of an entire village and the creation of a massive ice-making machine, which ominously towers above the tree-line. Although utterly fascinating in one way, Weir allows a different perspective on it and the way he shoots it makes it terrifying and almost alien. It mirrors Allie's personality and, interestingly, breaks down the same way he eventually does. The only difference being that the building collapses rather fast, while Allie breaks down slowly and gradually. Step by step losing his sanity and grip on the real world, done in a way that is subtle and yet easily noticeable. Harrison Ford delivers by far one of his best performances, convinces with every facet of Allie's character and has the needed presence to be actually quite scary. However, despite having villainous tendencies, one can't help but feel sorry for him and watch as his psyche deteriorates under the heat and stickiness of the jungle. Credit also goes to the supporting cast, mainly River Phoenix and Helen Mirren, who do a tremendous job in their roles and play off Ford's character excellently.

Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast is an impressive and criminally underrated piece of work that features just about everything that makes him such an interesting and brilliant director. The drama is compelling, the setting leaves a deep impression and the characters feel real. Brilliant story-telling by one of my favourite directors make this a real triumph of the 80s.

The story itself is not great but it knows this and makes fun of itself many times throughout. Loved how much time was given to Daffy in this movie since he is one of my favorites.

Bronson is a very troubled film and despite several obvious qualities simply isn't as satisfying as it should be. Refn, who recently skyrocketed to stardom with his 80's B-Movie homage Drive, is an accomplished director and even when his output is weak it still has many redeeming aspects about it. In the case of Bronson the redeeming quality is without a doubt the fantastic central performance by then new-comer Tom Hardy. Arguably the most important part of every character study is to really get the audience into the mindset of the protagonist and for that a strong actor is needed. Hardy has the presence and subtlety required for the film to work at all and he really gave his best in this star-making role. Unfortunately, Hardy is let down by an otherwise confused and at times poor direction.

Although it's still a visually arresting film, something I've come to expect from the director of Valhalla Rising and Drive, it lacks in coherence and loses its steam early on, never to catch it up again. Creative decisions such as the theatre scenes may sound great on paper but lack in their execution, making them exceedingly tiring each time they appear on screen. Similarly, the acts of violence and numerous fights, whilst visceral and brutal like they should be, are repetitive and numb the overall punch of the film after the 100th time. Bronson is a terrifying beast and the film does a great job at conveying that, but the lack of fresh ideas throughout and the weak pacing leave much to be desired. As a result, Bronson has its moments but entire sections are dull and uninvesting. An interesting entry in Refn's filmography that ultimately left me disappointed.

Yesterday, while sifting through some of my ratings, I noticed that I had only ever seen three Peter Weir films, despite adoring all three of them. It never really occurred to me that I'm a huge fan of his work but apparently I am, yet having only seen three of his many films I knew I had to explore the rest of his work. When going through his filmography Dead Poets Society was one of the more striking entries to me, since it's very well-known and highly regarded. I've heard many times of the inspiriational, moving effect this film supposedly has and knowing just how affecting The Truman Show was I felt enormous excitement about it. Whether it's the wide open fields in Witness or the ferocious sea in Master and Commander, Weir has a way of really transporting audiences into a different world. It's hard to explain but his movies seemingly effortlessly suck you in and consume you.

Things felt right at the beginning and it was all set to be another spiritual experience in the way that only Weir seems to do it. However, and as much as it pains me to say this, Dead Poets Society is disappointing and frustrating in every way it shouldn't be. It is definitely true that it touches upon very serious and difficult matters but the manner in which it is done is cloying and uninspired. Much if not all of it stems from the script as, with the exception of Robin Williams, the cast gives solid, some even excellent performances that save this film from being unbearable. Whereas each of Weir's other films I've seen is distinct in style, utterly engrossing and memorable, this just felt superficial and sickeningly manipulative. In fact, had I not known beforehand I would never have guessed that this is from the same man who gave me those wonderful memories of Truman's revelation or the construction of the house in Witness.

What looked like the perfect place to start catching up with one of my favourite director's filmography turned out to be rather off-putting and left me completely cold.

Fantastically well-executed action movie starring Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, super tough loyal head of the President’s security team. Distraught after failing to prevent the death of the First Lady in a tragic car accident, Mike leaves the job he loves to work behind a desk in the treasury department. The day after Independence Day, The White House is infiltrated by North Korean terrorists, taking the President and his staff hostage. At this point we see a slow motion shot of a flaming, bullet-ridden American flag falling to the ground – this is about as subtle as this film gets. Instinctively springing into action, only Mike has the knowledge and skills to save lives, reclaim the building and prevent a global nuclear war. He’s disastrously failed the President before, but is it now his time to make amends?...Probably.

The violent action is phenomenally good in a brutal, no-nonsense way – necks snap back from headshots, brains splatter on walls, knives are thrust handle-deep into necks; you really couldn’t wish for more, especially in comparison with the usual 12A watered down releases we’re subjected to. Even the exposition is solidly handled with a similar muscular swagger – it’s certainly not a film you could accuse of being over intricate. Savagely direct – much like Butler – no time is wasted over-thinking as it gets down to business and powers through 2 hours. Rapidly paced, it doesn’t slow for a second – and as the plot is constrained to The White House it feels more frenetic and dangerous, dispensing with the turgid “we need to get from point A to point B for some reason!” stuff, allowing ‘Olympus’ a consistent rhythm that never allows enjoyment levels to drop. The countless plot holes and cliches are plain as day, but with all the explosive nonsense happening on screen there's no time to stop for contemplation.

Butler doesn't have the charisma or presence of other leading men but his work always has an earnestness and enthusiasm which makes amends. He does a decent job here, nailing some killer lines in his gruff, unplaceable American-Scottish accent, and instilling a brutish physicality into every fight. He's no Bruce Willis, but even Bruce Willis isn't Bruce Willis these days. The North Koreans make for brilliant cut-throat villains who – for a change – don't fuck about, mercilessly killing hostages and agents without ceremony, literally piling up bodies on The White House lawn. In lieu of any characterisation or motive, barbaric bloodshed does a fine job of turning us against those ‘sonsabitches’.

A refreshingly uncomplicated piece of genre cinema that is consistently entertaining and most importantly, fun. It doesn't mock the cliches - it's entirely constructed from them. For undemanding Friday night viewing ‘Olympus Has Fallen’ couldn't really be much better. God bless America.

I put this in my Netflix Queue after I happened upon a random /r/movies post that celebrated it's unexpected awesomeness.  Then I promptly forgot about it.  

Cut to: several months later when it appeared near the top of my queue.  I decided to watch it because it sounded like a nice, light comedy that could put me in better spirits after watching *The Machinist* for the first time.  

I will agree with that random redditor from all those months ago - it was much better than I expected!  It should be noted that the first scene contains one of the most cliche comedic stunts ever, but I urge you to stick with it.

Topher Grace stars as Matt Franklin - an MIT graduate with no motivation to go into banking (it's the 80's, everyone was doing it).  Along with his twin sister (Anna Faris) and best friend (Dan Fogler), Matt attends a party thrown by his sister's high school sweetheart (Chris Pratt).  Matt's goal is to get with his high school crush (Teresa Palmer) but he is a painfully awkward individual.  There are actually several scenes in which his awkwardness is illustrated beautifully.

Anyway, that's the basic structure for the film.  I thought it was a great example of how to do a romantic comedy right - equal parts genuinely funny and sentimental.  I actually cared about most of the characters that the film focused on, which is a rarity in most rom-coms (for me). 

Some interesting character cameos round out *Take Me Home Tonight*, including comedians Demetri Martin, Michael Ian Black, and Bob Odenkirk (for literally like 5 seconds).   

The soundtrack was great, too.  Very good selection of 80's tunes (both expected and unexpected).  

Nothing groundbreaking in this film, but I enjoyed it (and had Kim Carnes' *Bette Davis Eyes* stuck in my head all day afterwards).  I'd recommend it to anyone in the mood for a light, yet sincere coming-of-age film that actually provides some decent laughs (and awkward cringes).

To start, I went in with incredibly high expectations. I heard about the free screening for college kids/faculty in our area just yesterday and knew immediately that I had to go (Check [here](https://www.facebook.com/PixarMonstersUniversity/events) for one in your area! They have a lot more coming up!) Monster's **Inc.** is one of Pixar's best movies and I don't think anybody would really argue that. The team of Pixar truly had their work cut out for them in impressing me and the rest of my generation that grew up and graduated with Andy (Toy Story) and fell in love with Sully and Mike when we were 9 (2001). Heck, maybe that's why they did the movie now, but the stakes were still pretty high.

All that being said, I want to give a standing ovation to Pixar. Hands down, Monster's University is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest, most AWWWdorable, and flat out most heart warming movies we've seen from them. You'll develop entirely new feelings for the original characters (sometimes falling in love all over again and sometimes not so much), but make room in your heart for the new ones!! For those of you out of the college world, you'll relive the glory days during every minute. For those of you with kids, this movie will make them laugh but I PROMISE you'll be laughing even harder. I honestly think this is some of Pixar's best work to date. I was continually surprised throughout the movie and just when I thought I knew what was happening or thought I was close to a disappointing plot turn, I was always completely surprised. I was thoroughly entertained from start to the very last credit scrolling across the screen. Y'all can hate on this completely positive review all you want, or blame it on the Pixar kid I'll always be, but 10/10 I *will* see it again the day it is officially released.

Any questions, I'll answer as best I can without spoiling anything.

Funny film this one. I enjoyed it, but at the same time there are parts that I just can't ignore. The premise was incredibly interesting to me and the trailer showed stunning visuals which I adore. I really enjoy Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet, which the story to Upside down is similar, so I figured I'd give this a chance.

The visuals are really there, a lot of detail has been given to the whole environment leaning almost to an artistic styling over the expected realism you'd imagine for a futuristic world. That being said the final shot completely lost me and didn't fit with my understanding at all. I follow films quite well but the final shot was cut in such a way it looked like it was in the same time period but with a guess you'd actually expect it to be the future from this story line. In fact a lot for scenes were cut badly for no reason. 

Acting is fantastic from Jim Sturgess and his accent really adds to the story. I feel like he made the best of the character but he couldn't hold them film up on his own. 

I'd say the film goes to hell about halfway through when it gets a bit silly and decides rather than answering questions or making it believable they'll just end a scene as is and not explain it. One scene has Adam (Jim Sturgess) in the opposite world sleeping. How did he get home? He removed the inverted materials that didn't catch fire? I believe this was before he got the heat proofing stuff so how in the hell could he get back. Another has Eden pregnant. When the hell did they have sex. HOW could they have sex. Stuff like that. 

I think the story could've continued better with the progression of the magic pollen directly through Adam rather than a side character. However the story had sort of lost it's way by then anyway so that probably wouldn't of helped it.

I believe this will be a great film with a remake. Story had potential and was wasted.

Adam Scott (Parks and Recreation, Party Down, other stuff probably) delivers a fantastic performance as Caleb Sinclaire in this dark dramedy about a dysfunctional family living in Rhode Island.  When Caleb's brother, Peter (Alex Frost), brings his first college girlfriend, Emma (Brittany Snow), home for break, tensions between the brothers and their father (J.K. Simmons) skyrocket.  Caleb's recent devastating heartbreak has him acting aggressively protective of his brother and judgmental of Emma's intentions with him; but while he is very wary of her, he's also immediately infatuated with her.  Certainly a recipe for some chaos.

Anyway, enough plot summary.  I really enjoyed *The Vicious Kind*.  It was very alarming to watch Caleb fluctuate from terrifyingly intense to sad and apologetic throughout the film.  I had never seen Adam Scott act this dramatically before, even though I've been a huge fan of his TV work - I hope he gets more cool roles like this.  J.K. Simmons is always dynamite, and this movie is no exception.  

Netflix calls it a ""dark comedy"", but I believe that only the first half qualifies as comedy.  It gets rather dark (and personal) in the second half.  Still, there are some great lines scattered throughout.  I had a hard time figuring out who to root for in this one.  Part of me identified a lot with Caleb's struggles, so I found myself rooting for him even though I knew he wasn't acting sensibly.  Caleb's brother is another solid choice (you can't help but feel bad for him - he's so innocent and unassuming!)  Donald, the father, is also sympathetic, although you don't see it in him at the start.

Great characters, great writing, and an overall enjoyable experience (though you will be left with a bittersweet taste in your mouth as the credits roll).  I'd recommend it to people who enjoy indie films like *Safety Not Guaranteed* or *Sleepwalk With Me*, or if you're an Adam Scott fan and want to see him tackle something more serious.

Paul Sheldon is an author who has been writing a series of books whose title character is named 'Misery' for many years. He has a habit of going to a specific hotel to finish the books, and when he completes one, he has a cigarette (he used to smoke) and a glass of Dom Perignon champagne. 

However, on this particular occasion Paul gets unlucky and crashes his car in a violent blizzard after leaving the hotel. Luckily for Paul, he is rescued by a local kindly nurse, who also happens to be his 'number one fan.' 

Nurse Annie carries out some emergency repairs on his busted legs and cares for him in the few days between the accident and his return to consciousness. In return, Paul allows Annie to read the finished manuscript for the final book in the 'Misery' series.

And that's where things start getting weird. 

This film immortalised the expressions 'I'm your number one fan' and 'did I do good?' in film history, and they're now part of our popular culture. I highly recommend watching it to discover for yourself why any A-lister or indeed celebrity in general will feel a sense of fear and panic when they hear the former expression come from someone. Often parodied, often said in jest, but deadly serious when spoken by Annie.

After that, the movie drags like heavy chains through mud for a good thirty minutes. I was thinking this was going to be the worst Bond film ever. But Moonraker still gets to hold that title. 

Once Skyfall gets moving, it's okay. Though it comes to a complete stop about two or three more times after the first half. 

Silva is a great villian. Probably the best since maybe Zorn. Silva is a delightfully twisted soul. Sad, pathetic, and absolutely terrifying. 

The ending is very witty. I liked that. There are a lot of witty moments in the film. And when the plot is moving, it's exciting and fun to watch. The middle thirty minutes are the best.

I'm not sure which is the worst part of the movie. The parts that drag to a halt or getting beaten into an inch of my life by the theme of ""old vs. new"".

Skyfall is now on my list of my least favorite Bond films. It's not a bad film, but compared to some of my favorites such as Dr. No, Goldfinger, OHMSS, and Casino Royale (2006), it comes up way short IMHO.

First of I am here to ask something that could be a spoiler, so if you have not scene it skipped to the next paragraph. Where did the scar on the back of her head come from? Did I miss something? It seemed like such a big part of the film that was going to lead to something. What was actually reveal was really surprising, and maybe the scar was just a diversion. Despite this one little part that bugs me, the film really delivered. 

Mavis is not a character dressed up in the beginning to be stripped naked by the end. It is pretty apparent what she is all about. A one-note character that will keep you entertained throughout. They pretty much promise a train wreck at the end. I thought, ""Hell yah, self-centered Bitch is gunna get what she deserves,"" but I ended up really relating to her clinging to a self-image to smite those from the past. One of her ending lines really hits me hard. 

Matt made me want to watch more moves with Pat in it. He also made me hungry thinking of Remy. I didn't learn until I saw a video about Coraline that characters are specifically added just so the Protagonist doesn't seem crazy, alone, and uninteresting. The book Coraline did not have the other child character in it. In that sense, Matt is a great device for bring out what Mavis is really going through. 

The movie didn't end how I thought it would which is a good thing. I feel the character arc lands her into the same place she started. The only thing that really changed was her thoughts of the past. Wanting a simple a life is where I thought she would end up, but maybe we just have to remember that there is nothing wrong to saying ""Fuck You"" to a certain aspect of our life even if there is no reason to really hate it in the first place as long as it helps us move on.

1334563518.0,7,self.Ijustwatched,sc46n,IJW Les Diaboliques (1955),OneSalientOversight,8,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/sc46n/ijw_les_diaboliques_1955/,"Before watching this film for the first time I was completely unaware that it was a thriller film or had any knowledge of its outcome. Thus I was able to watch it first time without anything being spoiled.

There is a point somewhere in movie history when fantasy became naturalised. By this I mean that the idea that the fantastic beomes commonplace and almost expected. Les Diaboliques came from an age when this was not the case.

As I watched the film I was constantly aware of just how modern movies use fantasy as their schtick. Had LD been a modern film, the idea that a person had come back from the dead or that the film was a dream sequence or the result of an unreliable narrator would've been a serious consideration. Such an idea was not a consideration for Clouzet when making this film. Like (most) Hitchcock, the mystery had a logical solution.

Of course I was not aware of the problem until Michel Delassalle's body disappeared from the pool. Up until that point the film seemed to be about the tension of the protagonists in setting up Michel's murder and the disposal of his body. *Double Indemnity* comes to mind as a film whereby the protagonists are the bad guys trying to cover up their evil deeds and the interpersonal friction that causes.

But when the body disappears, the film turns from *film noir* to *thriller* and *horror*.

As I watched my mind was engaged. What had happened to Michel's body? Was there someone else involved that I hadn't seen yet? Had the body disappeared down a drain somehow? This was a delight to experience and shows just how important it is for filmmakers to engage the brains of the audience and trust in their intelligence. Moreover Clouzet didn't resort to the sort of obvious hints that Hitchcock used in *Vertigo* (a film I recently viewed). Clouzet seems to trust his audience more than Hitchcock did (think of the scene in Vertigo when the camera fixes upon Kim Novak's hair, and then pans upward to the picture, showing beyond any doubt the link between the two).

It was somewhere near the end when I finally understood what was going on. About 5 minutes before the mystery had been revealed I had worked it out myself. With a film like *The Sixth Sense* I was able to work out director Dingdong's mystery half-way through. Maybe we need more Clouzets and less Dingdongs directing thrillers?

Nevertheless I did find the solution itself to have problems. Like many of Hitchcock's films the solution itself relies upon too much that cannot be relied upon in real life. What would've happened had Christina not suffered a heart attack? What if Christina had decided to ensure Michel was dead herself by keeping his head under water or keeping his body underwater in the pool? What if she had had an attack of conscience and gone to the police to report the murder?

The other annoying part was the presence of Alfred the detective. The guy almost forces himself into the case against the will of both Christina and Nicole. The fact that he solves the case and appears at the end to arrest the bad guys was just too easy. But maybe this is just my own postmodernism coming in to play here as I would be quite satisfied with a film in which Nicole and Michel get away with it - Clouzet, however, was bound by the modernism of his period which dictated that bad guys never get away with their deeds. I don't know, perhaps he could've inserted the detective earlier into the story and let him solve it in a more realistic and less sudden manner.

It was a great film though. It got my brain going and it inserted a great mystery for the audience to ponder upon, turning a boilerplate *film noir* into something more valuable and memorable.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_sc46n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/sc46n/ijw_les_diaboliques_1955/,

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a Russian police officer who goes to Chicago to bring home a Russian criminal. James Belushi plays a Chicago police officer who accompanies Arnie around town. Shenanigans ensue, culminating in the good guys and the bad guy playing ""chicken"" with two buses. Include in this some thawing cold-war relations.

This could've been a good film but ended up being quite disappointing. There was more depth to it than Twins (the other Schwarzenegger film in 1988), which was probably because the script was partially written by Troy Kennedy Martin, the guy who created the original BBC miniseries Edge of Darkness.

In short, the problem with the film was James Belushi. Being a ""buddy cop"" film, Red Heat needed a comical partner to offset Schwarzenegger's serious attitude. It didn't work though. Belushi (who would star as another comedic police officer in the film K-9) and Arnie had very little chemistry onscreen, and the scenes in which chemistry was important ended up feeling quite forced. If Twins showed that Arnie could do comedy, Red Heat showed that there were certain comedies Arnie should not get involved in. Remember, the 80s was when Arnie moved from being a body builder into being a movie star, and films like this and Twins were attempts at broadening his appeal.

The film was produced and released in a very important time in history. The USSR had opened up with Gorbachev's Perestroika but the end of communism itself was still a few years away. Red Heat was partially filmed in Moscow, and Russians were being portrayed more sympathetically. Arnie is not Russian, though, and the film's Russian language section was so badly done that it has become a so-bad-it's-good cult classic amongst Russian film buffs.

The characters themselves are not especially appealing. Arnie loses his partner at the beginning of the film and all we see is him stoically watching his funeral.  Does he really care that his partner has been killed? A touch of anger or sadness would've helped, especially as he gets closer to the killer in Chicago later in the film. But Arnie remained emotionless, making his character less sympathetic for viewers. Belushi's character, similarly, loses a partner and good friend to the same killer, but continues to crack rude jokes, complain, swear and carry in like an idiot afterwards. Both cops shared the same pain of losing a partner to the same killer and that should've been the common ground that they could work on. I suspect scriptwriter Troy Kennedy Martin knew this, and it wouldn't have taken much to understand this concept in light of the new openness and friendliness between the US and the USSR at the time. Sadly, though, the opportunity was wasted. Neither character seemed to care one whit that their partners had been killed, which robbed the film of emotional depth. Gee, even Rainier Wolfcastle - Arnie's parody in The Simpsons - had more emotional depth when his partner was killed in a buddy-cop (""Mendozaaaaaaa!!!!"")

Arnie himself looks very different in this film. He appears to have toned down his bulkiness for the Chicago scenes in the film at least, and there are angles where he looks very similar to Val Kilmer's Iceman character from Top Gun (1986).

The best acting in the film was done by ""Larry Fishburne"" before he changed his first name to Laurence. Fishburne plays a broomstick-up-the-rear-end always-follow-procedure cop who hates Belushi's slackness and lack of professionalism. The problem was that Fishburne somehow added too much depth to his character. He may have been a rigid cop but his actions are quite brave and, though he was a stickler for the rules, he gave the impression that he followed them solely to ensure that the bad guys were put away. There is one excruciating scene where Fishburne's character seemingly rejoices in Belushi's bad fortune, but it almost feels as though that scene were tacked on to please some Hollywood execs out there.

I also felt that the film depicted African-Americans very poorly. This isn't me being politically correct - African Americans feature prominently in the film, but they are explicitly depicted as either evil or stupid. There's no neutral African American character for the audience to be exposed to - Laurence Fishburne's character could have achieved this had the script not included that excruciating scene.

Overall it feels as though this film was as a grand experiment which suffered from bad casting choices and script interference. Admittedly, though, it did make a lot of money. Moreover, Arnie's character (captain Ivan Danko) is one of the very few positive portrayals of Soviet era Russians in Hollywood history, even if Russians themselves find him hilarious.

I regret my decision.

This movie suffers from one of more common pitfalls of the horror genre in the last couple of decades: too much action, not enough suspense. It starts from the opening. Rather than have the titular house's backstory explained through dialog within the film, the writers relied on a flashback crutch to set up the reason behind the haunting. And once the film gets going at about the 10 or 15 minute mark, there are virtually no chances for the audience to catch its breath. In short, the pacing was too frantic.

The pace might not have been so bad were it not for the wooden acting turned in by nearly the entire cast. To be fair, it's not entirely their fault. The plot develops so fast and the horror continues for so long, it's nearly impossible to portray character reactions realistically.

Another issue I take with this movie is that the plot doesn't leave any room for a more rational fear. The producer's desire to use cutting edge special effects seems to have outweighed any concern for preserving that sense of believability that exists in horror films where the threat is (or can be construed to be) non-super natural in origin.

Overall, I would recommend against wasting your time with this.

So first I want to start off by saying that I absolutely love this movie.


I love this movie because it doesn't feel like it is trying to hard. It's not overly artsy or flashy, it's just a good movie with great elements. 

One of my favorite things about this movie is how realistic the dialogue is. There are funny/witty conversations, but not every character is some comedic genius. Bill Murray had so much charm, and a lot of it came from how down-to-earth his character was. 

I also love how unconventional the storytelling is. There isn't really a distinguishable ""conflict, rising action, and resolution"" type of set up. It's kind of just a movie about things that happen. 

Mainly what I like is the way it shows how boring and ordinary life is. It has a way of showing a dull things while the movie still has charisma. The entire movie isn't dull, btw... I'm just thinking of some significant parts of it.. mostly towards the beginning. 

The only part I didn't like in this movie was the ""going out"" sequence... where Bob and Charlotte go out to a club, then do karaoke. It wasn't too corny or anything like that... it just felt kind of boring. 

Overall, I absolutely loved this movie. If any of you guys have any suggestions for other movies like this, that'd be awesome. 

I know ratings aren't necessary, but I'd give this movie an 8.5/10, and I'd say it now holds the #4 spot in my all time favorite movies. ",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1kj0a5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1kj0a5/ijw_lost_in_translation_2003/,

William (Patrick Fugit), a 15-year-old aspiring music journalist from San Diego, writes for his school paper and optimistically sends articles off to every publication he can think of. Unbelievably, he receives a call from the editor of Rolling Stone magazine offering him an assignment, and Will promptly suggests covering Stillwater, a mid level touring band he'd recently fallen in with at a Black Sabbath concert. Abandoning school and his loving but fretful mother (Frances McDormand) he sets off on tour with the band – witnessing first hand the sex, drugs and volatile relationships of the Stillwater lifestyle. Infatuated with Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a gorgeous young groupie, and idolising the exceptionally talented guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), Will learns more life lessons and shares more experiences in a few weeks than many do in 18 years.

Director Cameron Crowe clearly has a deep affection for the period and its music – ‘Almost Famous’ is loosely based on his own experiences – and presents an idealised vision from a fanboy’s eye that owes more to record sleeves and posters than to real life. For a tour filled with sex, drink and hallucinogenic drugs it all feels markedly clean and tame. Incredibly sweet-natured it avoids much of the darkness it alludes to, but this breezy tone makes ‘Almost Famous’ a poppy, endearing and funny look at growing up and fandom. It’s not as affecting as it might be as it plays the sleazy and more troubling elements so safe, but it’s never less than thoroughly enjoyable.

Fugit does a decent job as the wide eyed wannabe writer, but many of the best lines fall to Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Will’s mother and mentor respectively. Both small roles, but they’re strong characters who help break up some of the more cliched rock ‘n’ roll elements. It may never look or feel authentically of the time but ultimately this matters little. We’re experiencing this world through Will’s naivety and rose tinted glasses and he – like Crowe – is fanatical about the bands and the music, both aware of the debauched murky side but unwilling to look at it in any meaningful way. Fundamentally it is nostalgic and saccharine but nevertheless captures something real about the innocence of youth, and most importantly does it with a joyfully warm ride, as funny as it is touching. The 70’s were nothing like this, but who cares?

One of the best documentaries I have seen. I remember watching a long time ago a documentary on the treatment of Palestine by the Israelis, whilst good, the bias was about as subtle as a truck. The gatekeepers whilst obvious written from a pro Israel perspective delves into the Palestinian situation through the eyes of the former Shin Bet commanders. Their stories and their take as professionals on points of history such as the Intifada, the Rabin assassination are all thoroughly engrossing and told with a refreshing dose of honesty. The ex-commanders talk freely about torture and assassinating people, this is completely surprising and unexpected considering the constant party line of moral highground that the Israelis are so famous for sticking to. Scattered throughout the documentary are some absolutely poignant quotes (i.e. 'no morality in war', 'one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter') which whilst we have all heard before, in the context of the Israel-Palestinian situation, are given some real depth and power.

I would highly recommend anybody with a fascination with the situation in the middle east and geopolitics to give this a watch. If not for the realization that the violence begets more violence and the situation is untenable but from a purely operational viewpoint, you will have a great look into the workings of the Shin Bet and the Israeli security system.",,False,,t5_2rafo,False,,,True,t3_1jh5ei,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/1jh5ei/ijw_the_gatekeepers_2012/,

**Postives:** The actors portraying the crew were fantastic and I thought they brought a great sense of realism, which helped with overall immersion. Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame especially delivered payloads in some well acted scenes. Visually, I thought this was some of the best effects I've seen all year. Considering it cost $10M to make, (compare that with two thematically similar films: Prometheus - $130M vs Apollo 18's $5M), I think they did amazing things with the budget and time constraint they had.

**Greatest Strength:** I think though this film's greatest strengths are its respect to the subject matter -the realism in not only technology, be the behavior of people, scientists especially. Often cited as the crutch of Prometheus, where the best of humanity's scientists touch and taste there way through the foreboding alien planet. I'd like to think a special nod to that occurs in scene where Dr. Katya says, ""I wish I could take one of these gloves off and touch the ice."" Where then a crew member immediately replies with, ""Please don't.""

**Negatives:** Though the crew in space are competently acted, the crew down on earth, namely, Embeth Davidtz and Dan Fogler, really took me out of the realism with there often over the top and cliche performances. Also I found myself often times chronologically lost. Though the director does a great job of knowing that often times less is more, by the time there is the [big creature reveal, I found it to be anti-climactic, maybe it the fact that nothing was hinted to us as what to expect or maybe it was just me and watching too many monster/creature movies but I felt the ""endboss"" design could have been much more alien and fantastic.](/spoiler)

There is much more tension than lets say Apollo 18 because there is depth. And as a sci-fi film, it is much better than Prometheus, for the sheer fact that the crew doesn't act like complete idiots, rooting you in complete realism throughout the majority of the film. It doesn't do a single thing new however, and you can almost guess what happens in the film just by thinking of all the other similar films of this genre. 

**I'd give it a 6.5/10 for regular viewers, but 7/10 for fans of the genre.**

I've seen a lot of offensive films in my time, from Cannibal Holocaust to A Siberian Film, but this one is easily the most tasteless, offensive, unpleasant films I have ever seen. Yet somehow it is also riveting, like watching a car crash unfold in slow motion. Several times I was on the verge of turning it off in sheer disgust, but found myself holding off, just to see how much more depraved it could get. 

The ""plot"", such as it is, concerns a pair of time-travelling reporters from Italy going back to the south of the USA during the heyday of slavery, to conduct a ""inquest"" into slavery. Presenting itself as a condemnation of slavery, it instead revels in the unpleasantness, delivering atrocity upon atrocity with a smirk on it's face. The horror inflicted on the slaves in Django Unchained pales in comparison to the never-ending parade of unpleasantries served up here. I suppose it does present a view of what slaves went through at the time, but it's hard to feel that they are condemning the acts when all the slaves are presented as little more than dumb animals. 

Amongst the dubious ""delights"" on offer are rape, castration, paedophilia and the truly horrible scene where the poor reporter is ""seduced"" by a 13 year old black prostitute. It's made so much worse as everything is presented as though we are seeing it through their eyes. 

It's certainly unforgettable, and if you're not easily offended or squeamish, it's worth watching once, even if it's just to see how low Italian exploitation cinema managed to stoop. You might need a good shower afterwards, however.

Part Arabic, part French he is victimised by both groups in the oppressive environment that spills over with racial tension, leaving him to resort to any means simply to survive. Pressurised into helping the Corsican gang who essentially run the prison he soon becomes the pet ‘Arab’ of surly volatile boss, César (Niels Arestrup), making his coffee, cleaning his cell and running errands. But Malik rightly feels no loyalty to the Corsicans and passes between them and an ever growing Muslim contingent, putting his own plans and ambitions into effect and truly becoming something for the first time in his life.

Utilising all the tension and machismo of the genre this is a captivating underdog story told with the familiarity of convention – but it effortlessly radiates something far more spiritual that elevates it above a mere prison drama. Malik remains untouched by religion, and is instead driven by betterment – in the form of education – and personal success, able to freely glide between the factions of the prison, forever changing the lives of those he comes into contact with. This transient, confident figure bears little relation to the fragile boy we first met, but regardless of his transformation a surreal spectre of his past wrongdoing continually haunts him, a reminder of his vulnerability and mortality. Tahar Rahim is exceptional as Malik producing a performance that embodies the character’s naivety and vulnerability with an underlying steely determination and focus. He lives an entire life inside, and sharing this journey makes the film compelling – he remains an enigma, but having watched him suffer such hardships in the first movement he retains our undying sympathy. 

Shot with a realist eye that captures the sweaty claustrophobic intensity of prison life, every second inside feels authentically cramped and oppressive – the cells look almost as filthy as the guards who run them. This makes occasional forays into the wider world all the more poignant and calming, basking in natural beauty and the luxury of space. It’s at these moments that the film is at its most profound – what exactly it’s saying is pitched with the right amount of ambiguity, but it’s undeniably stirring and capable of eliciting a feeling beyond words. The sheer clarity of Audiard's directorial vision is what makes ‘A Prophet’ such a special film – revelling in the hallmarks of the prison genre, but shaping Malik’s odyssey into something of transcendent beauty that is both equivocal and utterly fulfilling.

Well, technically, from my current point of view, until the end of this review, it'd be more accurate to say IAW Olympus Has Fallen, so this review will probably be very stream-of-consciousness-y as I give my thoughts at various points in the movie.

* ~10 minutes in: So that introduction was confusing. All I can really gather is that the First Lady died, and therefore President Dent is sad. Also, that kid is going to be annoying and present the entire film, isn't he?

* ~0:15: Ah, so Gerard Butler was the guy who saved the President Dent. I think we can call him Spartan Batman now.

* 0:25: Finally some action! Interestingly, they answered all of the things that would've been major plotholes, like [how the fuck did an unregistered flight get near DC.](/spoiler) Otherwise, the whole scene felt like it was trying to bring up memories of 9/11 with all the [scenes of the plane swooping near buildings and destruction of the Washington Monument.](/spoiler). Also, this is the movie **not** directed by Roland Emmerich? White House Down must feature DC being turned into a crater then.

* 0:30: This movie just became a CoD fight. Someone just got an 11 kills kilstreak. Come on, Spartan Batman, do a no-scope!

* 0:32: I don't think these terrorists or North Koreans really have a gameplan here. If the goal was to assassinate the president, then why [didn't they just shoot him down in the bunker with their first shot? Beyond that, even if they take control of the White House, as looks likely, if they're trying to take him to somewhere that isn't likely to be stomping with the military within the hour, then how on earth would they do that since DC would've become a no-fly zone as soon as the first plane had shot our guys?](/spoiler) 

* 0:33: There's that military I expected.

* The more I watch, the more I want the White House to be a map in a CoD game. We had the Pentagon, why not other maps based on layouts that are freely in the public domain?

* 0:37: [Title Drop](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop)! Take a drink!

* 0:39: [Dylan McDermott is a bad guy?](/spoiler) This is my completely unsurprised face.

* 0:40: They keep trying to make me feel something. Maybe it's because my suspension of disbelief was destroyed 10 minutes ago.

* 0:42: Was just reminded of the annoying kid again. Followed by a unnecessary scene of some hospital.

* 0:46: Ok, so the plan is [to unite Korea under the leadership of the commies](/spoiler), and here's the kicker, [to stop Koreans from starving.](/spoiler) My suspension of disbelief needs booze to come back.

* 0:48: Ah, the old ""Can we trust this guy after what he did thing."" Another square for Die Hard bingo.

* 0:51: 

&gt; ""Their blood will be on your hands."" - Head Terrorist

 What? No. The blood is on the hands of whoever kills a person. In this case, very clearly, the terrorists.

* 0:52: 

&gt; The US doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

Yet another bingo square.

* 1:00: [Kid rescued](/spoiler). Take a drink.

* 1:25: And the East Wing is down!

* 1:27: Talking back to Morgan Freeman? That's a paddlin.

* 1:32: And there's the daily dose of narm.

* 1:44: Spartan Batman made through on his promise.

* 1:50: Now that the movie's over, I have to say that this is not a good movie, but it has a purpose. That purpose is to be a lot like the Independence Day, giving a sense of patriotism and MURICA, FUCK YEAH!, and on the front, it does it well.

 In this movie, an insane general give the order to start a nuclear strike on the Russians and the President and his generals at the Pentagon try to stop it before it causes the end of the world.

This is one of Stanley Kubrick's most famous films. It is a hilarious black comedy that satirizes the fear of nuclear war and shows what happens when patriotism goes too far. It is full of over-the-top performances especially by Sterling Hayden as the insane General Ripper and George C. Scott as the hilarious General Trugidson.

Working a stable – but seedy – job in a porn production lab Richie already has a dark side to hide when he begins dating his eventual wife, the saintly Deborah (Winona Ryder). But when his ice cold, emotionless calm in the presence of violence is noted by mob boss Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta) he is promptly recruited as a contract killer – turning his secret life irreversibly blacker. Remaining the doting husband and father, Richie spends his years ruthlessly killing – sometimes for money, sometimes in anger – whilst becoming tangled in a web of mob politics and deceit that begins to threaten his family.

Shannon’s central performance is exceptional and justifies the price of admission alone – smouldering with intense menace, yet effortlessly transforming into the tender family man behind closed doors. Richie is a thoroughly vicious and deceitful man, but Shannon’s presence and subtleties are such that he cuts the perfect anti-hero, seldom likeable but always captivating.

In its attempt to chart such a vast length of time there is never really a strong enough narrative to tie ‘The Iceman’ together, and the disjointed murders and exploits feel more like a collected series of short films. We never really get a clear picture of Kuklinski or his motives, leaving the experience lacking a cumulative emotional impact: the film may have been more successful as a small scale character study that got its hands dirty finding out what makes him tick. As a whole it doesn’t work, but individually there are countless moments of dark thrilling brilliance that are separately powerful enough to keep you engaged.

Along with Shannon’s brooding Kuklinski the support cast are all exceptional, none more so than an unrecognisable Chris Evans as rival hitman Robert 'Mr. Softy' Pronge, who moonlights as an ice cream man, van and all. ‘The Iceman’ has its flaws but a slew of fine actors turning in solid performances in every scene make it eminently watchable. 

Visually the 1970’s are stylishly recreated in washed-out colours and well-observed details, creating a moody atmospheric world that goes a long way to uniting this disparate film. Fundamentally a fairly run-of-the-mill mob biopic that falls into the formula of the genre, thanks to Shannon and a talented ensemble cast it’s an invigorating watch, with something authentically sordid at its heart.

Soderbergh is a director I find myself drawn to in a weird way. I've now seen three of his films, and all three of them, although perfectly fine films, never stood out to me as particularly great, and yet I still find him to be interesting. His direction is conventional and lacks certain characteristics that make different directors distinguishable from each other. He has a way of just pointing the camera at things and letting the setting and actors do the work. Like with his other work, Behind the Candelabra is a fairly plain film, despite the opulence of Liberace's shows and living circumstances. It's far less indulgent than one would expect from a film that revels in wealth and glamour as much as this, and while I quite dig that it also works against it in a way.

Matt Damon and particularly Michael Douglas are good in their respective roles, selling not just the individual characters but also the relationship between the two. Whether they're having quiet, romantic moments or heated arguments, the duo is a joy to watch and boost the entertainment factor infinitely. In a way they completely carry the movie, as with the exception of the set and costume design, I can't help but feel the whole affair is slightly bland, nor did I ever truly feel emotionally invested with either of the characters. It's a story worth telling but I'm not sure whether Soderbergh was the right choice for it. He's too calculated and cold as a director to pull something like this off. In the end, Behind the Candelabra is interesting and moderately entertaining but also a missed opportunity.

Howard Hawks' white-knuckle, violent gangster classic Scarface may pale in comparison to the remake in terms of success and popularity, given that De Palma's film was practically an instant cult classic and has remained a strong presence in pop culture over the years, but for many reasons I think it's both much more interesting and superior to the remake. At 90 minutes it is roughly half the running time of the 80s version, and the pace is accordingly high. It moves at the same speed as the many bullets fired during it, and like its many drive-by shootouts flies by the screen, giving you not a moment to breathe. Its no non-sense and brutal approach to the source material is shocking for a film of its time, the visceral gunfights still packing quite a punch after all these decades.

Of course, De Palma's version one-ups the film in regards to violence, but during a time in which it had become much more common, whereas Hawks' production was quite daring, and its violent escapades are still exhilarating to watch. At the center of the film is the charismatic but ruthless Tony Camonte, excellently played by Muni, whose rise to success within organized crime and eventual downfall is depicted as brisk as the duration of a drive-by. Despite coming up short in running time Muni's Tony is much more rounded and menacing than Pacino's. It's also told in a far more personal manner, making the climax actually very emotional. Muni comes off as much more natural and human than I remember Pacino being.

Howard Hawks' Scarface is exciting, brutal, and a truly riveting piece of gangster cinema.

*Jack the Giant Slayer* is an enjoyable film if you have 2 hours to waste and easy access to the film, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it. With its family-friendly classification, it is suitable for everyone but young children because of a few scenes (no blood/gore but action violence).

**Story** - *A Giant Tale*

The fairytale setting of the film is a welcome reprieve from superheroes, sequels and 'serious' films of late. The chances are that you already know what the story is and how it will end, but that doesn't stop it from being a bit of light entertainment. The acting is solid, with Hoult, Tomlinson and McGregor being supported by a wide cast of famous and not-so-famous faces. In particular Hoult, fresh from *Warm Bodies*, seems to quickly get into his stride and give a great performance of the titular Jack.

**Music** - *Audio Jack*

The musical score, created by [John Ottman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0653211/) (who has created the score for many of Singer's recent films) is unfortunately easily forgettable but it nonetheless fits the setting of the film, its orchestral sound intertwined with a choir of voices.

**Special Effects** - *3D Fo Fum*

While most of the CGI was generally well done, there are some parts in which it's very jarring.

However, it's immediately evident he hasn’t left the gallery far behind. Too abstracted and self-indulgent to work as a piece of narrative cinema, a loose tale centred around extraterrestrials inhabiting the drab northern town of Preston – in the guise of Chinese immigrants – is poorly communicated, and lost in fast edits of biological imagery and urban landscapes. The experience is defiantly impenetrable and near impossible to engage with, but there is still obvious cinematic potential and an intriguing journey to be taken with the film.

Visually arresting, it captures something truly supernatural in the commonplace scenery of England. Narratively it may leave you cold, but it undeniably captures a spellbinding melancholic aura with its imagery. Swaying trees, deserted roads, birds of prey, cellular photography – the quick cutting between this ever-changing collage delivers an emotive experience – but one that is far too vague to convey the desired themes of race, religion and love. Stylistically it has been shown a great deal of attention, but the script and more typical exposition elements feel neglected and markedly televisual, which jars with the inventive beauty and unpredictability of the photography. With no ‘scene’ lasting longer than a few minutes (frequently less) the intriguing core conceit is never able to captivate or move in the way it might.

‘Piercing Brightness’ is a work of art. To judge it as a feature feels harsh, yet that is what it purports to be. Dawood should be applauded for his ambition and confidence in his first film, but this is very much a small initial step from gallery to cinema. Clearly a talented cinematographer, it will be fascinating to see what he produces in the future as he learns his trade as a storyteller.
