How on Earth are experienced travelers suppose to answer non-questions like those? Are you hoping we have some amazing secrets? Are you hoping you'll get a gazillion brilliant ideas? There are a lot of people with amazing insight, knowledge, and experience that are more than willing to take the time to share with you, but only if you ask real questions.

If you want my advice on how to get good advice, do your research first and *then* ask specific questions. Interested in a country? Check out the Wikitravel article as well as other sources, figure out a few things that sound cool, and *then* ask /r/solotravel if these places are worthwhile and how to approach experiencing them. ""Taiwan sounds cool. I want to see x, y, z. Are they worth seeing? Is it doable in 2 weeks for $1500? Any other great places to hike?""

Tell us what you like to do. ""I want to do some amazing things"" is vague. Amazing means different things to different people.

Tell us how you like to travel. ""I want to travel cheaply"" means nothing; of course everyone wants to save money. Do you want to stay in air-conditioned hostels and eat out at local places or are you going to camp on the road and dumpster dive?

**Day 1** I arrive in Saigon. I sweat my ass off in a real weight room for the first time in months. I meet a Hippie Ex-Pat who hooks me up with a joint. I drink with 4 Vietnamese girls and take one of them back to a hotel for some small talk / rough sex.

**Day 2** SLEEEEEEEP. Meet up with the same girl and one of her friends. We ride motorcycles all over the city and hit up an incredible seafood joint, a karaoke bar, a western bar with live music, a club, and delicious street food. I take her to the same hotel again. She pays for the room. I convince her to try anal. Nice.

**Day 3** She takes me to a water park. We splash around and scream on water-slides all day. We get back and I tie her up using the Japanese bondage rope I'd purchased the week before in the 8 story tall sex shop in Tokyo. She likes it. She leaves to go to work. I start feeling ill.

**Day 4** I wake up with a fever. Fuck. I am sweating and shivering in a somewhat delirious state for 6 hours. I eat nothing, and sip water. I am nauseous as all hell and trying not to vomit everywhere. It's not going well. I decide I need to puke and crawl into the bathroom. Looking at the toilet, I feel a gurgle in my stomach and realize I need to shit, and it's not going to wait. God damnit. I drop trow and try to squeeze one out before I puke all over the bathroom. My ass proceeds to unleash hellish diarrhea into the bowl as I try to keep my stomach in check. It is the definition of explosive. Suddenly the world goes into slow motion. I see stars. I'm sweating profusely and realize that something is profoundly wrong. I'm about to pass out. I decide I need help, but I'm deadlocked in this room. Summoning the last of my strength, I whip my pants up, stumble to the hotel door, unlatch it and fall to the ground in the hallway. I lose consciousness. Yes. I shit so hard I passed out.

I come to after who knows how long and am too weak to stand. I contemplate whether I need to go to the hospital. I decide to give sleeping it off one more shot. I crawl back into bed, drink some water and successfully fall asleep to Game of Thrones. 

**Day 5** I wake up at 6am to find I have shit the bed. 

*Fuck.*

 I shower, pack up, and get the fuck out of dodge leaving the ruined sheets in a wet mess in the bathroom corner. I catch a bus out of that city and laugh at the insanity that was my week.

1349207061.0,57,self.solotravel,10tzrb,Why travel solo?,norkkinimod,61,4,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/10tzrb/why_travel_solo/,"As it seems to me, there are a lot of users, that have no real idea of what to expect when travelling solo. So maybe there should be also a place to discuss what going solo really means, what it feels like and why the hell would somebody be crazy enough to do it?

First of, I wouldn't say I'm a highly experienced traveller. I've always been kind of a nomad, didn't spend more than a year at one place for the last 5 years. Somehow it feels like I'm always just travelling. So I'll try to give some base for a discussion anyways.

Reasons for going solo:

- **No partner? No problem!** Travel partners should be chosen wisely. I've had friendships ruined within a 10 day trip. If you don't know your partner well enough before travelling, you will definetely know afterwards. It's quite similar to post-holiday breakups. You get to spend an awfull lot of time together, sometimes very close and will soon realise if you fit together or not. All you need is someone you would trust in any situation, you know each others weak points and tolerate them. If you can't think of someone like that for your journey, it might be best to go alone.

- **The wolf pack** Especially if you travel together with a group it's very likely to happen, that you stay within this social frame for the whole trip. It is comfortable and safe to be around people you know... and boring! Homo Sapiens is a highly social creature and it's way easier to meet new people if you are on your own, provided you are not a Super-SAP. Try to stick with the locals and you might get a fascinating deep insight into the culture you are visiting. 

- **Travel light** What goes for your backpack might also apply to your company. You and yourself can go wherever you feel like in any moment, you make decissions more quickly and don't have to find difficult compromises. This leaves out a lot of reasons that can turn any trip into a frustrating journey. Also you don't have to take care of anybody else, if you don't have a partner that is constantly frightened or a bit dopey.

- **Dora the Self-explorer** While travelling with others you can discuss every new experience, always comparing your views. So it's not only your box you're thinking in, it's also the other's. Some of them might block out things without even trying it. To really make up your mind, you need to be with yourself. You can just enjoy every impression, really let yourself go, if you are not feeling watched, or even judged by someone else. In some cases you might find new ways of thinking inside yourself or a new way of living by the culture you've just stumbled into. Anyhow travelling alone will definitely change you... hopefully for the better. (new aspect from xTooTiredToCarex) 

(more reasons likely to follow)

Risks of going solo:

- **Lonely hearts club** One of the biggest challenges for any solotraveller is loneliness. You don't speak the language but want to have a deep conversation or you just need someone to comfort you while beeing homesick, then you will feel lonely... maybe as lonely as you've never felt before. At home you enjoy your alone time, but again there is this primary instinct that wants you to be around other humans from time to time. Even if you are, you might feel even more lonely. Beeing stuck alone in the rainforest during a Taifun for three days is nothing compared to beeing in a crowded bar in an inhospitable area, where everyone is avoiding the stranger. That's the point where you should entertain yourself by building shelter, or buy a big bottle of vodka and share it with random people next to you - depending on the situation of course.

- **Gimme your money!** Travelling as a group might be safer in most parts of the world, especially for women (I know, there are some tough gals out there, but I try to keep this universally valid). Alone you are easily outnumbered. For most of us it's less likely to get out of such a situation Jackie Chan-style than just getting stabbed. Most important is: Don't look like an easy target. If you're not built like a bear, just avoid carrying around expensive stuff openly, dressing fancy in a non-fancy area or looking like you are lost and frightened (even if you are). Common sense is the best way to notice if someone is just friendly or wants to lure you to something unpleasant. Even if you stumble into a shady situation, always act self-confident. Just like with other mamals, don't show fear in front of humans. Don't be too proud to yell for help, as soon as shit is really going to hit the fan.

- **Can you hand me th... Oh.** Everybody needs an extra hand from time to time. Setting up camp, climbing down a steep trail, negotiating prices at the local market, stuff like this feels safer and is faster done, if you have someone with you. But it's far from impossible. All you need to do is to practice particular skills and if you're alone... well you don't have any other option than to do it by yourself, right?

- **The Aftermath** Every journey leaves you with a huge ammount of experiences, good and bad ones, and it's great to have someone to share this with afterwards. Someone who was also there, experienced the same things with you. Someone who really understands what you're actually talking about. After a long solo trip it may seem like no one really can empathise while you tell the most fantastic stories to them. Their eyes just look empty while you feel like you've had a glimpse of heaven. And still they want you to talk about it. This can lead to feeling less at home, every time you return home and is a big part of the so called ""Traveller's Curse"". It seems there is no certain cure for this. For me personally it helps a lot to write about my trips instead of telling stories to my friends in person.

(more risks likely to come)

1372171775.0,58,self.solotravel,1h1fya,My Guide to Solotraveling and Why You'll Love It,croptonyellow,70,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1h1fya/my_guide_to_solotraveling_and_why_youll_love_it/,"Hello,

I found that I ended up putting lots of little tidbits in various comment threads and that it might make more sense to just do one big comprehensive guide to solotraveling.

A bit about me, mid-20s single male living in New York (American passport).  I've solotraveled to Reykjavik, Cape Town, Tokyo, Sydney and Auckland.  Major disclaimer, these are based on my experiences alone and should not be taken as gospel or a singularly comprehensive guide to anything, just my advice after making some dumb mistakes and learning a lot.


1) How do you like to travel?

Before picking a destination or methods of transportation, ask yourself: how am I most comfortable?  Do I prefer hostels and backpackers or the Hilton?  Am I uncomfortable on long flights?  Can't stand the ocean?  Racist against certain groups?  The point is that before you plan any part of your adventure (and it is just that, an adventure), you'll have the best time if you know your likes and dislikes.  If you enjoy a warm, comfy bed and a bathroom with granite countertops, backpacking through Vietnam may not be your thing.  If you can't stand being trapped on a plane, probably best to save Australia for another day (assuming you're in Europe or the Americas, that is).  The point is, some soul searching beforehand can save you a lot of grief.  Just be honest with yourself.  It's not a bad thing to enjoy staying at the Hilton, it's better to know it now than wind up finding it out after it's too late.


2) Picking a destination(s)

Particularly if this is your first trip, take babysteps.  Never traveled alone?  Probably not the best time for that epic month-long backpack trip through Nepal.  Keep it simple for the first one.  That doesn't necessarily mean local, but try to make it easy on yourself.  For example, pick a place where they speak your native language, where you know the currency and/or the attractions, perhaps even a place you've been before.  

Bearing this in mind, pick a place(s) you've always wanted to go.  It could be somewhere exotic and funky and awesome, or something pretty simple and easy like the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Beyond genuinely being into where you want to go, be cognizant of other factors.  These can include:

-Financial issues: Can I afford transportation, accommodation, local transportation, food and drink, attraction prices, and extra cushion spending money?  Take what you spend now on a day-to-day basis and double it, and that's what you should be able to afford on your trip.  Traveling can get expensive very quickly on things you may not have predicted and it definitely helps to have a cushion.

-Visa issues: Probably not an issue for many people, but I've heard horror stories from others, particularly if your passport isn't from an OECD country.  However, always, ALWAYS check with your country's foreign office to see what restrictions or paperwork is needed.  Example: Australia and the USA - in the visa waiver program, but you're still required to fill out paperwork in advance.

-Language barriers: What's the native language?  Any de facto common languages?  For example, Morocco it's mainly Arabic and French, but sometimes a bit of fractured English.  Can you get by without a translator?  Note on English: Most people speak very fractured English, often times a bit more.  Movies, TV, music and films
more often than not are produced in English so people globally have been exposed to it.  That said, do NOT assume someone speaks English.  Learn a few phrases in the local language.  That way, at the very least, it shows that you tried and give a crap and people are more willing to respond, as opposed to being ""that guy"" who yells in English and assumes people will speak it.

-Comfort issues: Is the place a 14 hour plane ride away, is traveling around hard/expensive, is it hot as/cold as hell, etc etc.  Basically see #1.


3) Planning your trip

You picked your destination?  Sweet!  Now plan your trip.  To maximize your experience I would recommend planning out and booking in advance (if possible) the following:

-Flights or other to-destination transportation

-Hotels/accommodation

-Transportation to/from the airport, train station, wherever.  Often times cabs are available but expensive (sometimes VERY, VERY expensive, like London or Tokyo).  Most cities typically have a train or a bus that goes to the city center which is almost always cheaper and pretty easy.

-Get some cash before you leave: I usually do about $50-$100 in local currency.  Helps grease the wheels, you can buy a coffee when you land, etc.  Credit cards are being accepted more and more but usually not for smaller purchases.  More on that later.

-A couple of things to do: Always good to have some sights in mind in your backpocket, particularly for the first day.  You'll find other things to do, of course, but it always helps.

The first of these are absolutes - flights, accommodation and intra-city transport.  Here's why.  You just got off a 12 hour flight, which door-to-door took about 16 hours.  You're jetlagged, exhausted, slightly delirious and overstimulated.  What, you want to now find a hotel so you're not homeless for the night?  It just makes life so much easier.  Some people enjoy the ""adventure"" of finding a place when you land, personally that sounds like a recipe for disaster.  

I personally use Expedia to book hotels and flights out of habit and because they have a frequent points program so if you use them enough you get small amounts of coupons (very small, but still &gt; 0).  I like TripAdvisor for ratings and rankings, I've found it to be remarkably reliable, though Expedia also has comments and ratings.  I'd check out other sites as well, though, like Kayak, if you're particularly price conscious.  More on saving money on flights later.


4) You've arrived.  Now what?

Congrats, you've arrived safely (most likely).  Now what?  Typically I plan a city for 3-5 days.  When I solotravel I tend to do what I call ""city tasters"" - that is, I'm not doing a deepdive into a city or country, but rather seeing all the bigticket items and getting a solid first-time exposure to a new place, with the expectation that if I like it, I'd go back for a longer period of time and really do it ""right"".  For example, Reykjavik was 2 days, Cape Town 4, Tokyo 5, Sydney 6, Auckland 3.  

The best piece of advice I can give on an actual trip is a quote I heard somewhere (not sure who said it, to be honest, but it's not mine): ""Planning is invaluable, plans are useless.""  Have some destinations in mind, but at the same time, nothing beats an impromptu change of heart.  Because, after all, you're traveling alone, you can do whatever you want.

Appendix: Do's and Don't

This is just a general list of things I try to do or avoid when traveling.  Some I've learned from making dumb mistakes, others from stories I've heard from other people.  This list is by no means comprehensive, more of an FYI.

A) Getting the cheapest flight.  Airlines operate a form of price discrimination where different people pay vastly different prices for the same basic seat.  Why?  Because they can.  But, this also means you can take advantage of this and get a cheaper seat if you book smart.  Think about it this way.  The people who are most price conscious are ""retail"" flyers like you or me.  The people who are the least price conscious are business travelers and super rich people (irrelevant as they fly first class).  Business travelers are often required to fly based on a timetable (say, that big meeting in Tokyo), and since the firm is paying for the flight, they don't care as much about price.  Thus, avoid when business people travel, which is often Sunday or Monday, Thursday or Friday (sometimes Thursday, anyway).  Saturdays and Wednesdays are my go-to days.  The best thing you can do, though, is play around with booking sites.  If you have a general sense of when you'd like to go, try booking on different days to see which combination is the best, weighed against the cost of the hotel room (meaning if you save $100 by spending an extra night and the hotel is $150, not worth it).

B) Internet.  I always try to go for places with complimentary internet.  If you have to pay for it it's usually ridiculous expensive.  'Nuff said.

C) Make a list of 5-10 items that are absolutely irreplaceable.  It's really hard to try to remember every little thing that you packed and are supposed to remember.  Thus, I like to make a list before I go of the main, major things that I cannot easily replace.  Typically the list is: Passport, wallet, phone, retainer, computer, phone charger, computer charger, power adapter.  If I have those 8 things, I know I've got all the main items that I would need, and if I forgot something, at least it wasn't overwhelmingly important.

D) Safes for passports: I usually do it just in case, though I've never had an experience where I've felt that I really avoided a theft by doing so.  That said, if you're in less than exceptional accommodations, a padlock for your bag is probably a good idea (and I wouldn't bring my laptop in this case either).

E) Walking and Stamina.  I tend to walk a lot, as much as possible, and try to avoid taking buses or public transport unless really necessary (like, it's 20km away).  The reason is that when you walk everywhere a) you get great exercise, b) you get much more of a feel for the culture of the city you're in and c) you get the chance to see stuff you might normally have missed, stores, arcades, experiences, brewery tours (in my case).  I've found when I take the subway everywhere I end up seeing more planned destinations but at the expense of getting a real feel for the city I'm in.  

F) Look like you know where you're going/don't look like a tourist.  Walking with confidence is really helpful for looking like you know where you're going and thus aren't a tourist.  Made a wrong turn?  Go to the next block and go back.  A bit lost?  Go into a shop or store to look at your map.  Wearing your American flag t-shirt with shorts and flip-flops and a camera around your neck?  Go f*** yourself, you gon' get robbed.  

G) Cash and ATMs.  I like to take $50-$100 in cash that I got in advance from an AmEx travel office.  The problem with Bureaus de Change and Travelexes and other similar services at the airport is they tend to charge a fat fee plus the terrible conversion rate.  If you have an American Express credit card they'll waive the fee, but even if you don't, it's not that bad.  If you plan to bring credit cards, be aware of the following:
-Visa and MasterCard are the most accepted.  AmEx as well but it depends on the country.  Discover, Diner's Club, don't bother.
-In the US and sometimes Canada credit cards are based on the magstripe on the back.  In Europe and elsewhere, it's based on a chip and pin, similar to a debit card.  To that end, many automated machines for tickets and others in a chip-and-pin country don't always take a magstripe card because a signature is required.  Best to stick with buying things from a person at the ticket window or wherever.
-ATMs: Know the fee structure upfront.  Usually with FX transactions you get the spot rate at the time + a 3% surcharge for credit cards and ATM withdrawals.  With withdrawing, though, you also run the risk of racking up insane fees.  Know the fee structure in advance so you know how to get cash most efficiently (i.e., if it's a big fixed fee, take out lots of cash upfront and keep the excess in the safe in the hotel).  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_ATM_Alliance 
-Traveler's checks: Good for fraud protection, make you look like a tourist, though.
-BIG NOTE ON DEBIT CARDS: Consider leaving it at home, and here's why.  Debit cards are the equivalent of writing a check.  As such, if someone steals your debit card and buys something, once the EFTPOS goes through (electronic funds transfer point of sale, for the nerds like me), the cash is gone.  Some debit cards offer fraud protection/theft protection but it's less common.  Credit cards, however, have much higher fraud protection and in many cases your liability is limited to a fixed amount (I believe it's $50 but don't quote me on that).  Best to a) check with your card issuer what the limits are and b) if possible, avoid the problem by leaving your debit card at home and withdrawing cash in advance or traveler's checks.  You can theoretically withdraw cash from your credit card but by doing so you'll rack up a huge interest fee so best to avoid that.
Best thing to do is to write down your card numbers in advance so you can call the companies ASAP and report them stolen.


Why You're Nervous, Why You'll Love It

It makes total sense to be nervous.  You're going to a foreign place, by yourself, and your safety net is limited.  You don't know anyone, you don't (necessarily) speak the language, you don't know where you're going.  If you weren't nervous, particularly before your first trip, that would be a red flag, rather than the other way around.
However, you'll have to trust me on this, you'll have a great time.  If you're prepared and if you're smart, you'll have a wonderful experience.  The best way to enjoy yourself is to mentally prepare yourself to have fun.  If you come into it with a negative attitude, you're gonna have a bad time (insert meme here).  The trick I use to psyche myself up before a trip is to focus on how much I'm going to grow and learn from the experience.  I'm going to get a crash course in an entirely new culture and style of living.  I'm going to experience something that most people dream of.  I'm going to have plenty of time to rest, relax, recharge, and reflect.  

And, what the hell, take a bit of pride.  You're planning a trip all on your own.  There's a courage in saying ""I choose to go here because I can.  To hell with the lack of companionship, I'm the master of my fate!"".  

Edit: A couple things on travel loneliness.  Traveling alone can get lonely, which is another reason why I try to cap it at a week.  After a week it can get a bit lonely.  A few ways to limit loneliness:

-If you have internet, write an email to a friend or loved one about your experiences.  It'll make you feel connected to him or her/them even if you're not actually speaking directly.

-Bring books, particularly books you like (now's not the time for that textbook you need to read for school)

-Chit chat and small talk.  It's just that, small and ephemeral, but it's nice just to talk to people.  Besides, you learn from them that way.

-Focus on the present.  You'll see your friends and family again in a few days, for now, enjoy your time alone.  You'll have lots of time to see them when you get back, you're only in [place] ""once"".

Edit 2: Formatting

I wanted to go to Legazpi, and all the buses (at least the ones you can check walking) were fully booked. So catch a random bus that was about to leave with free seats, just because 'it went 9 hours south' during the night. That way I ended at 5am in Naga, almost spending my last Pesos.

I didn't know what to do and somebody told me about some wakeboard complex. Everything was closed at 5pm, but they told me there will be two ATM there. After two nights in a row of almost no sleep, having no food, grabbing a ""10 Pesos"" bus that 'should drop me almost there'... and 4km walking with my backpack under the sun I arrived there. Then my credit card didn't work in any of the ATM. BUMMER.

I had to figure out how to get to Legazpi (3h) eat something and calm down my thirst with 170PHP (I was sure I was going to be able to, but still... you know the feeling). I was fine but a little bit sad.

So, I was trying to make the bad day good watching the people wakeboard and this australian guy approached me and tells me if I was ok. He had seen me walking on the way and he told me I seemed 'a little bit lost'.

We spoke for a little bit and then he stopped talking and invited me to try with his own equipment, and payed an hour for me to try. He asked me to return the favor but not to him, to another traveller when I feel it's the right occasion. Later he even drove me to the bus stop and after thanking him again... I don't know how but he realized I was hungry and even when I lied to him that I had a sandwich on my bag. He invited me to a doughnut and water.

I know this is silly but this guy transformed a pretty lame sleepy-hungry morning on to a very nice day of travel and I wanted to share it with you as my first post on reddit (reader for years, commenter for months and this is still my first ;).

This generally ends with ""write a list of things you want to see"" and ""go to x region"". I find these kinda useless, if you know what you want to see you wouldn't be asking, so if I can give some advice its this. Find a mission. 

Find something that your interested in, if you love history follow the trail of Alexander the great or . if your interested in religion choose one of the many pilgrimages around the world. Maybe visit the largest statues or the largest malls, whatever take your fancy. hell if your interested in Australia visit all the big things from the big pineapple to the big mareep. get a rail pass and take every rail line in a city or entire country if you have the time, get off at random stops or just wait till you see something amazing out the window then go explore. If your an eco warrior go save some rain forest in Ecuador or pick up a book on local plants and find them all. If your a foodie get a book of recipes from a region and track each one down and try it in its natural habitat or learn how too cook it. Call your grandma from every area code in the country. Take the trans Mongolian instead of flying from Europe to Asia. Hell take a stuffed animal with you so you can take pictures of it at every attraction you visit to show your nieces and nephews where you've been.

I do insist on paying something every month towards rent because I don't want to scrounge off them now I'm working full time.
My evenings out consist of playing board games with a bunch of friends so I don't spend much on clubbing or drinking. On a basic plan, I should be able to save £20,000 ($30,500 for you American folks) by January 2015. I'll be 20 at this point.
I have a medical condition which directly affects pretty much every joint in my body. There's an extremely high chance I'll be in a wheelchair by the time I'm mid-30's possibly sooner.

I've done quite a bit of solo traveling over the years and I noticed that it had put me into a certain mindset. A mindset which I decided to drop for the last trip I took. 

When I was 18 I traveled through India for about 3,5 months and a lot of the time conversations with random strangers ended up in people asking for money or offering goods (or their daughter) which made me avoid talking to locals. Whenever someone was making an offer that seemed to good to be true, I'd pass up on it. After 99% of conversations ending up like this, it made me avoid engaging with most of the locals all together simply because I had some bad experiences in the past. 

For my last trip, I decided it was time for a general reset. I went to Indonesia for about two months and decided this time I'd do it differently. People signaling me to come over across the street? Lets go have a look instead of walking on. People telling me they'll sort it all out? Lets have a look and see if they do instead of trying to sort it out yourself. Going places with complete strangers without having the faintest idea of what will happen and hardly being able to talk to them? Good, lets go and see what happens. 

In short: I've had the most fantastic trip I've had in a long time, some highlights (links to long version on my blog):

- When attending a [funeral ceremony on Bali](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/the-death-of-a-guru-budakeling-bali-indonesia/) a man told me to come sit with him while we waited for things to start. We ended up spending the entire afternoon together discussing religion, culture and the different ways societies deal with them. He invited me to visit his arts center if I had the chance. I did, it was fantastic.

- When arriving in [Makassar](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/hey-mister-you-really-need-learn-bahasa-makassar-sulawesi-indonesia/) I wanted to go to a town called Bira. The directions I found online turned out to be pretty useless and no one at the bus terminal spoke English. I decided to sit down and read for a while and let the universe sort things out. I ended up arriving where I wanted to be because a group of local teens took me to their family home, rented a car and drove me all the way to my final destination. 

- While attending a [funeral ceremony in Toraja](http://thebigdream.org/2012/08/a-torajan-funeral-tana-toraja-sulawesi-indonesia/) I spoke for a while with a young man who turned out to be the grandson of the deceased. He offered me to come up to the family house and join him in some spots normally inaccessible to tourists during the ceremony and we had a nice long talk about how it is to live with such traditional beliefs. We're now friends on facebook and chat regularly.

- Instead of just looking at the wares of the local [handicraft people](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/kacek-and-his-coconuts-ubud-area-bali-indonesia/) and [artists](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/asu-art-attack-ubud-bali-indonesia/), I tried to actively engage in conversation with them. What were they making, how long did it take them to make it, who taught them to do it, did they enjoy it? I learned more about their lives than I ever would have if I just would have walked on. 

I'm posting this because I met a lot of people who are like I was, thinking 'the locals' always want something from you or see you as a walking dollar sign based on some bad experiences they've had in the past and I'd like to encourage everyone who shares that feeling to reset it during their next trip and see where it takes them. Often, it's beautiful.

**TL;DR**: After some bad experiences with people treating me as a walking dollar sign I got into the habbit of avoiding locals on my travels, cutting off conversations and rejecting any kind of offer they'd make. My last 2 month trip to Indonesia I stopped doing that and had some of the best experiences of my life. If you are avoiding locals, I'd encourage you to try to stop doing that your next trip and see where it takes you.

I've spent the last week on a road trip of the Eastern US. Just me and my car. In that time, I've gone hiking, gone swimming, and tried to escape from reality.

I'm an introvert, meaning I need a little bit of alone time. I didn't realize how much alone time I'd be getting. Every night, I'd cry before finding something online to distract me. The loneliness is absolutely terrible. I was using this trip as a test to see if I could handle a trip overseas on my own, and now I am doubting myself. I was not willing to take the risks on my own that I would with somebody else. I never felt bonded to a particular city. I would see a sight and have nobody to share the moment with. I was staying in generic hotels (Sleep Inns, Holiday Inns) filled with families and little opportunity of meeting anybody.

1375504008.0,30,self.solotravel,1jlzes,"Fellow vagabonds, what was the thing that sparked your itchy feet and made you realise you can't live at one place forever?",norkkinimod,41,11,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1jlzes/fellow_vagabonds_what_was_the_thing_that_sparked/,"A lot of people share this uneasy feeling that you are bond to move on: Sometimes even if your head tells you to stay and hold on to the things you have, your heart aches to leave everything behind and set off to new shores. Sometimes it takes a lot of overcoming, sometimes we hastily pack a bag and run off. But afterwards it always seems impossible to settle down again.

In my opinion those people are born with this feeling but for everyone there is one single event or experience that makes you finally close the door behind you and follow an uncertain path. 

I'm just the same. I always led an unsteady life, moving back and forth, left and right, but still - kind of desperately - trying to settle down somewhere. And then I bought his book. I don't know why, I was in a tiny bookstore in Schwerin, North Germany, randomly took out a book with an interesting title and bought it. It was ""Between the Woods and the Water"" by Patrick Leigh Fermor. Afterwards I sat down in a Restaurant on the street next to the bookstore and began reading until it got too dark and cold to remain. Halfway through the book it just hit me... and for some reason I remember the very moment and location where I realised, that I might as well give in to my inner urge and continue moving until one day my legs won't move anymore. I remember, like it was yesterday, sitting in our shared kitchen, staring at the cabinet and then suddenly shutting the book and calling for my flatmates to tell them that I've decided to move out end of this month.

From there I treasured the books of Sir Fermor like they were one big bible. A whole pantheon of traveling authors emerged in my head, starting from Herodot, Goethe, Fermor to Bruce Chatwin, Tiziano Terzani, Ceest Nooteboom and Michael Obert (to name a few). I ""inhaled"" their writings, their lives, their philosophies and my own life got easier. With accepting my own restlessness, I finally felt at ease with myself. I found myself among other haunted souls and learned that it's better to discover freely rather than to search for something. 

Now, whenever I get itchy feet, I just go with them. It forced me to reduce my life and belongings to what I can fit into a sailor's kitbag and it's hard to imagine how easy and simple life became.

One day I might eventually find myself at one place that drives this haunting away and I will settle down. But until then, I will keep moving - and whenever I get the thought that I should stand still for once, get myself a real job and ""grow up"", I take out ""Between the Woods and the Water"", read it, pack my bag and get moving.

Now... what's your story?

First thing is you will have bad days. You will be on your own for the day, although i havent yet spent an evening on my own. Just gotta keep the spirits up, get online and catch up with home, and have a drink and wait at your hostel for people to get back.

Second, solo travel is so common out here (thai islands, koh phangan at the moment) people are all looking for friends. I went to half moon party last night and although i was with a (sexy) girl all night, everyone i spoke to about it joked how they lost friends with in minutes and most of the party was solo.

Thirdly, i met mate who was too much company for 4 days, so you know what I did? Made my excuses and left him. Nice guy but too much 1 on 1. No problem at all.

Solo travelling golden rules: speak to everyone. I made friends with an israeli girl (38 yrs old,im 26) because i said hi as she sat down next to me on a boat, even though we didnt speak after that for the first 20 mins. Plant as many sociable seeds as you can.

Fourth, again YOU WILL HAVE BAD, LONELY MOMENTS BUT YOU HAVE GONE SOLO TRAVELLING WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? you've had the balls to go by yourself so your more confident than most. And if you dont believe that, booking the solo flight is proof enough. The bad moments dont last long, i promise.

1370936591.0,30,self.solotravel,1g3wqh,Currently about as far away from home as I can get: Advice for anyone nervous about traveling alone.,croptonyellow,33,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1g3wqh/currently_about_as_far_away_from_home_as_i_can/,"I'm from New York, currently in Sydney for the week by myself.  I imagine lots of people may be nervous or otherwise reticent regarding traveling alone, so I figured now's as good a time as any to provide some of the limited pointers I've gathered in my solo travels.  

Of course, take everything with a grain of salt, just one man's opinion...

1) Use your travels as an opportunity to learn as much as possible.  This can be obvious stuff like going to museums, but often it's the less obvious things that make or break a learning experience: sit in a cafe, people watch, observe local culture.  Watch local TV.  Read local newspapers and magazines (if possible, given language constraints).

2) Nonverbal communication is a great skill to learn.  Most communication, whether we realize it or not, is nonverbal; getting used to interpreting hand gestures and facial expressions can be incredibly useful.  Try practicing at home to get a good baseline sense - you'll be surprised how good you are at it.

3) Always bring books.

4) Research where you're going in advance.  You get so much more out of your experience having a baseline knowledge of the country you're visiting.  As well, people are infinitely more likely to help you if you demonstrate that you've put in an effort to learn about their culture and language.  Effort goes a long way.

5) If you get homesick write a letter to a loved one or friend.  Simply the act of conveying your thoughts to someone you have a connection with will make you feel connected and less lonely.  

6) Try to make it a point to strike up a conversation (if possible given language constraints) with a local at least once a day.  It's a good way to force yourself to be sociable even if you're shy (like me).  Bartenders, waiters, coffee shop baristas are all good bets, though even people on the street.  Similarly, fellow tourists are great for temporary companionship.

7) ""Planning is invaluable, plans are useless"": A beauty of solotravel is that you can break plans or change them at will.  You're the boss.  Always remember that.  

8) Make a list of things before you leave that are crucial to not forget.  It's too difficult to try to remember everything you should have packed, including your flip flops, umbrella and boxer shorts.  Keep it simple - what can you replace, what's irreplacable.  Keep it under 7 items, and at least once a day, check that you have all X# of items.  For example, mine usually includes cell phone, wallet, passport, laptop, phone charger, laptop charger and power converter.  Knowing you have a set number keeps it simple and makes it easier to not forget things.  And, should you forget something outside your list, at least it's not something critical (i.e., you can replace your undies, you can't get back home with your passport).  

9) Not applicable for some, but if you attended a big, international university or school, see if they have an alumni network in the country you're visiting and, if you're lucky, maybe they'll have an event.  It's a perfect way to meet people who a) speak your language b) you have something in common with and c) who you can easily befriend based on similar interests and experiences.  This can also be true in some cases through embassies, consulates or high commissions.

10) Number 10 but perhaps most importantly, ENJOY YOUR TIME ALONE.  This is your chance to be totally detached from your job, your homework, your SO, your responsibilities.  Enjoy the liberation attached with traveling alone.  You can go wherever you want, whenever you want.  You can sleep in, get up early, go to bed early, get hammered, do whatever you want.  You're free.  Enjoy the liberty of it.  

Anyway, just my two cents.  Solotravel can be daunting but also unbelievably enriching.  Use it as a tool to grow.

A few things I've done/seen/expierienced in my first week:
1. Eaten ceviche and had a pisco sour in Lima, Peru.
2. Danced till sunrise in a club with almost 100% locals.
3. Hiked the 4 day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, which without a doubt was the most challenging hike I've done to date.
4. Been pick pocketed, and had my backup debit and credit cards both fail on me, so I lived on US $10 for a week.

I am going to be traveling from USA to Hanoi Vietnam from July to August. I am traveling alone of course :D I am a little nervous. This will be my first trip going alone to a foreign country. Can solotravellers of reddit help a brother out? I've done researches about Vietnam on tripadvisor and lonelyplanet but feel that it is inadequate. Do you have websites for solotraveller that you recommend? 

I am planning to travel light. I will be buying Osprey Porter Travel Duffle (46-Liter) as luggage with Pacsafe Venturesafe 200 for day pack. Will this be sufficient? My balance for the entire trip is $3000 dollar. So far, airline tickets and travel insurance have taken away $1700. I have $1300 left for the entire trip, I am planning on spending $300 on must have gears for the trip and $1000 will be for food and travel in Vietnam.

The most valuable things I will be carrying around is my phone, ipod, and DSLR camera.

Here is a list of places I would like to go:
1. Hanoi
2. Ha Long Bay
3. Sa Pa
4. Mai Chau
5. Ninh Binh
6. Hue
7. Hoi An
8. Nha Trang
9. Da Lat
10. Mui Ne
11. Dong Nai
12. Sai Gon

Here are some of my concerns that are getting me nervous.

1. I've read that there are many modes of travelling, but from your experience, what is the best (pricing) and safest?
2. How do you find your lodging? Through the internet or through recommendation?
3. I won't be using tour company due to the strict budget, how do you tour the place yourself or what do you recommend I should do?

4.What are some of the things I should be watching out for in Vietnam as a first time solotraveller? My parents are extremely worried which then of course is also making me nervous (domino effect!).

The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure.

While we were leaving the parking lot one of the passengers stands up and yells that he forgot his phone plugged into an outlet at the pitstop. He begs the driver to let him off and after a good amount of harassing done by the rest of the passengers he lets him off. The second his foot hits the ground the bus driver shuts the door and peels off. He chased us til the highway. The patrons of the bus cursing the driver the rest of the way to Newark Nj. Once we arrived multiple people fill complaints and we discover the kid had beat us there. The rest of my trip involved movies odd conversations and staring out at the window.

I still believe that the right thing for me to do is to go and see the world, and I still fully intend to. But lately, I've found myself wondering if I have it in me to get out there and actually do it (""it"" is vagabonding, in a nutshell). Without going into pain-staking detail (unless you ask), I've set in motion for myself a globe-trotting experience that I hope will profoundly affect my perspectives of myself, the world, and I suppose everything else too. Now that it actually all seems to be coming together, I've begun to fear that the only thing that will change is the scenery around me and the language that I hear in a day.

Can you tell me how your travels changed you?

Is it normal to be afraid of such a life-changing circumstance?

TLDR: My big trip is coming soon, and now I'm starting to become afraid of...all sorts of things.

**Answers to the Common Questions:**

**but... money:**
I saved $20k in 9 months by working nights/weekends freelancing as well as cutting down severely on costs. My current home is &lt;80 sq ft. I stopped the smartphone. Even turned off Hulu &amp; Netflix. No more eating out... etc. I can work remotely as a programmer (already do/have). I am used to travelling extensively for work and working out of Regus business lounges.

**Where to?:**
Anyway, I'm going to Seoul first. Flight is all booked. I have friends there and I thought it best if I started with a known quantity. I love Seoul. I hope to head to Southeast Asia after that then India, Eastern Europe, Turkey &gt; Israel &gt; Cairo &gt; Morocco and end the year in South Africa. Then, Rio for Feb 2014+

**Luggage:**
MEI Voyageur after much research. 

**Burnout Prevention Plan** I will be staying with/near friends for most the big times. Typically, 2 months in one place with/near a goos friend then, 1 month overland transit/travel then repeat. Curious how other long term travelers manage. 

**What next?**
Don't know. Don't want to know.

**Why?**
Why not.

If you recognize me at this point but notice my account is new, its because I started a new account. I had used my old account at work and I don't want a tail. They are now a client. I like people not knowing where I am. Catch me if you can.

I'm a lady, if it matters. woot woot.

Share your island stories or ama.

I'd wake up on the beach, pack up my tarp and sleeping bag, and go swim.  Then, walk to the highway by around 10am, hitchhike to a town and get coffee / supplies.  

**Money**

I traveled thrifty.  I learned all the supermarkets on the island and where to score deals at them.  I learned where the deli put its stuff on sale in each grocery store when it was near expiry.  I got a job doing some light website work I did on my laptop at starbucks or McD.  I made a couple friends I'd stay with here or there, but mostly slept outside.  McD is nice because you can look homeless and get no glances, $1.06 *free refills* and free WiFi can't beat it.  (Don't eat that shit though, go buy 8 bananas for $1 and that's breakfast and lunch.)

**Transit**

Hitchhiking can be tricky but was mostly wildly successful; Probably 100 rides with no serious danger to report.  Mostly nice folk who will share bud!  The heleon bus goes all around the island, too, for $1.

This was usually entirely alone; no one in site (where I'd camp.)  I'm a very wary traveler.  I will chat up in a hostel, but alone, I keep to myself.  I avoid strangers while camping.   I did WWOOFing (farm trade work) there for the first 6 months before setting off. 

**My pack**

Two swimsuits (the only bottoms I needed; one to wear while the other dries; no need for underwear, really), T-shirts, goggles, map of the island, water, an empty box-wine bag for a pillow or backup canteen, a small ""pak-lite' sleeping bag I got for $4 from goodwill there, a tarp, Tennis shoes, socks, slippers (flip flops), a uke I never learned to play, little toiletry kit, sunscreen, rain shell, and whatever food I had for the next day or two.  I'm sure a few other items I'm forgetting, but main point is: I used [this medium sized internal frame backpack](http://dnok91peocsw3.cloudfront.net/inspiration/56628-612x612-1.png) and had all I needed.

I saw beautiful scenery, met amazing, interesting people, ate (so much) delicious food, and just got into so many ridiculous adventures.  I learned an immense amount about myself and about the world.  Also had my entire backpack stolen two weeks in, all part of the journey haha.

I wanted to make sure I took the time to thank all of you in this subreddit.  I was so nervous leading up to my backpacking trip, and many of you made my preparation so much less complicated and stressful.  It meant a lot.  Special shout out to /u/breaksy, you were a huge help and I appreciated all of your insight.

For those who care, the route I ended up forming was:

Frankfurt-Bruge-Amsterdam-Prague-Budapest-Venice-Florence-Naples-Island of Capri-Sorrento-Pompeii-Amalfi-Rome-Cinque Terre-Milan-Dublin-Galway-Aran Islands-London.

Galway, Cinque Terre, the Aran islands, and Florence were my favorites!

The basic situation is this: I have been saving up for an extended trip to se asia, australia, and then south america next summer, for a couple of years. My plan was to wait until I had graduated (which I now have), get a one-way flight to bangkok, and get the fuck out there. 

The day of my graduation a good friend of mine told me he had discussed it with his girlfriend and, if it was ok, he would like to come with me. I love the guy, he's one of my best mates, and of course I wasn't going to say no. 

However now im feeling slightly strange about the trip, almost a bit deflated. I've always enjoyed my own company and i've always found my best adventures have been when i've been lone-wolfing. Needless to say I feel like a bit of a dick for resenting the fact a good mate is now coming with me. I suppose I had this in my head as my personal adventure and it feels like thats been compromised somewhat. 

Am I being childish? 

What are peoples thoughts? I should add that im still incredibly excited, and have no doubt there will be numerous advantages to having a good friend with me.

Edit: I think part of the frustration is that I wanted to leave late june, however because the friend in question has a few things to sort out we're not going till mid-august now. so im basically sitting around twiddling my thumbs and eating into my travel budget. although it has given me time to learn some thai so swings and roundabouts!",,False,self,t5_2rxxm,1372625582.0,,,True,t3_1hdsxf,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1hdsxf/friend_has_last_minute_decided_to_accompany_me_on/,

* Since this is /r/solotravel you all obviously see solo travel as a normal thing, but how do you justify it to friends &amp; family, or do you even tell them?

- I hate sharing a bathroom with other people.

- I don't trust strangers around my personal belongings, no matter how nice they may be.  It's just too risky given the possibility of theft or (what worries me more) accidental damage.

- It's not financially prohibitive for me to find decent hotels (though I absolutely won't stay in a five star hotel or resort... too far removed from the local environment; artificial).

I'm from Spain (so this will problably have grammar errors), 18 years old, male, and with almost 0 experience in travelling (except a school exchange and a few with my family)

I want to travel. A lot. But right now i'm in the ''planning'' part, so i want to design a journey, i'm not looking to go somewhere exactly, i want the experience of travelling. 

I don't have any money or job, but i have not need of luxuries, so i can be a vagabond (i'm not sure that this is a thing) for a while, or hitchhiking a while, also i have a bike, so i can pedal....  my doubts right now are:

-What would you do?

-If this it's my first journey, would be recommended hitchhiking, vagabonding, etc...?

-Where would you go?

-Am I crazy for this desire of travel? (every person that i ask about travelling doesn't seem so enthusiastic for travelling)

-Also as a ''secondary task'' i would like to find my passion, drive, thing in life, etc... travelling would help with this task?

-Right now i've nothing tying me (not job, grilfriend, studies, etc...) so, altough i'm young, would this be a good time for me? or would you wait more time?

-How much money would be needed in this kind of travel?

-It's couchsurfing a secure manner of sleeping while travelling?

P.D: I've been a while thinking about travelling and my brainstorm ended up with something like : go bycicling south or east or west, depending on the easyness of the zone and when i've reach the coast start or hitchhiking or walking or bycicling (i'm not so sure that i'll be with the desire of keep pedalling so much) by the coast.... i remind you that this is a plan made for someone that has not traveled nothing, so i'm certain that has a lot of mistakes....

I tried my hardest to meet people, but some nights I just never did and those were really the worst parts of the trip.

I think it may have something to do with having a girlfriend back home (we got together after I had booked the trip) so obviously I was missing home a lot more than I would have been.

I'm so glad I went though - I seen some incredible things, met some of the nicest people, ate some fantastic food, learned a lot about myself and the world, found a new hobby and have many stories to tell at parties. However, I feel like I prefer traveling with someone else. I'm already planning my next trip for next summer (with my girlfriend this time) so it's not too bad.

I'm 17, turning 18 in the summer, and desperately want to take a gap year to travel through Oceania and Southeast Asia (New Zealand-Australia-Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore-Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam-Laos-Nepal-India) before college. I'd start in New Zealand or Australia with an internship for 3 months or so, and then I'd travel to another internship that would be either in Nepal or India. You should know that about 9 years I moved to another country and have traveled to numerous other countries (I'd consider myself pretty well exposed). But I think that is actually the reason for why I am so excited to see more of the world (I see it almost as my duty!). I am confident that I will be able to do this as well, I'm not just dreaming! On a side note, I have three sisters who have all done a gap year.

The problem is more or less that my parents think that it would make me too self-dependent. They're worried that I will have difficulty making a social life in college because I will have matured so much on my trip (this sounds like the crappiest logic ever). I'd see everyone as being too immature or something and would therefore have difficulty getting along with them. There is probably a more logical reason for why they don't want me to go on this trip but this is all they've told me. I find it especially strange that they're holding me back when all of my other siblings have done a gap year.

HOW YOU CAN HELP! What are good reasons for why I SHOULD travel, especially so young? Do you have any good articles? Examples of successful people who traveled young? Can you give me any inspiration for the regions I'm visiting? How about personal stories about life in college after gap year? And anything else you could think of is much appreciated!

P.S. Should I start in SEA and make my way 'down' or start in New Zealand and go up. I figured I'd start in New Zealand because of the season (starting trip around September) and to get used to traveling on my own in a country where I know the language. But maybe I should start in Nepal? I have some friend in SEA who will be there then so I'm tempted to start there.

EDIT: Thanks everyone! Awesome advice! I think I'll just keep figuring out the details of the trip and confront them with it. I know everyone is saying I should just run away, but they are my family and I don't just want to break off contact for this.

Hypothetically imagine you had a trip from Austin, TX to Egypt for 2 weeks. Upon arriving at the airport in Cairo, Egypt your 'Guardian' meets you at your gate with food and water and takes you to the car. He speaks fluent Arabic and has a vast knowledge of the country. He is ex military and has good solid medical skills to boot, which allows this guardian to be a subtle bodyguard/travel guide in countries you perhaps don't feel safe in. The guardian can be subtle on the other side of the nightclub, or sitting next to you sharing a conversation in the cafe or perhaps he will be in a park 1 mile away from your location, ready to meet you if you so desire for assistance? His role can be as covert as you please, which could allow you to truly have the solo experience without hindrance if so desired. 

.

You get the idea. Would such a service have a demand? Would parents use this service to reassure themselves of their child's first trip overseas? All opinions are welcome here folks.

I simply ask this community first hand if this is an idea I should run with. I work within the protection industry and as a solo traveller it's an idea I've often pondered with.

I've had this feeling ever since I was a kid and I've always had a hard time explaining it to other people. Basically I just want to hop on a motorcycle with the bare essentials and take my life one day at a time. See what happens.

The problem is that I know it would be irresponsible of me to do this. I don't have a degree (only about half way through school at the moment), I don't really have any skills that I could use to make money along the way (other than retail management), I'd drain my bank account, miss years of life with friends and family that I'll never get back and ultimately nothing tangible will be gained (the only thing I'll have is stories to tell and a bit of real world experience). 

On top of that I'm pretty sure this decision would be met with resistance from my family and friends who certainly would see it as a bad decision that would only set me back in life. So I'm not even sure I'd tell them that I was leaving... I'd rather just go before they tried to convince me otherwise.

My plan is to finish up my AA over the next year or so, buy a bike and take off as soon as I've tied up loose ends around here with my lease and bills and all that. Then, hop on my bike and go. That's it. No goodbyes, no plan, no path. Just the open road ahead of me.

There is a life story that goes with all this but it's mostly boring so I won't go into too much detail. Let's just leave it at this... I'm a 26 year old male who manages a liquor store full time, makes all A's in college (just started going back last year), has loving friends and a great family, a comfortable life in a 'not-too-big' but 'not-too-small' town, exercises on a daily basis and generally lives a comfortable life. 

But I'm not happy. And I've made mistakes that certainly involve one very beautiful, very special female. Consequentially I'm now stumbling my way into alcoholism, drowning my sorrows and regret in booze and blah blah blah (like I said, boring and cliche).

I don't know if I'm searching for happiness... I don't really know what I'm looking for... I guess I just wanted to talk to some people who maybe understand this feeling and discuss how they dealt with it, in particular the ones who did what I'm thinking about doing. Some would say the grass is greener on the other side while others would say that it really isn't. 

What do you think?

I am planning to go to the US for about 25 days (give or take) by myself in May of this year. I turned 21 about 6 months ago and am starting a full-time graduate job in June and the main focuses of my trip will be: music (I am aware that I will have missed Coachella, NOLA Jazzfest, and the June Warped Tour), food, people, sport, maybe stalking tv/movie stars and parties.

My main worries are: putting pressure on myself to meet people (even though I will be staying in hostels) as I know that, if I don't be at all extroverted, I will have a bad time; 
staying safe; 
going to college sport events and parties; and,
maybe meeting/seeing some famous people.
Also, although I am staying at hostels, I would like to take a suitcase. Is that an unwise or unsafe thing to do?

I know this may sound like a shallow trip, like that of a teenager, but I just want to let loose before I start my big, demanding corporate job. I wholly intend to come back for a more cultural and holistic trip when I am older and probably married.

The destinations of my trip are likely to be as below:
LA &gt; San Francisco &gt; Seattle &gt; New York &gt; LA.

Can anyone help me out with my worries or give me some tips on anything or anywhere that I am going to in the US?

ALSO, would anyone know of another subreddit that could also answer some of these questions? I was considering /r/australia or /r/america but I'm not too sure.

EDIT: Also, I am not sure if it matters, but I am a redditor with a separate account; not just someone using reddit as an Ask Yahoo replacement. I chose to make a new account for travel so I can divulge some identifying information

I've decided to pack my bags, walk out the door, and leave my home behind.

I'm a man in my late-20s, live in California, and would like to backpack around the world - spending sparsely and having no agenda or date of return. I've car-traveled a lot of the US, and have been to Mexico once for a vacation. I hike and backpack locally frequently.

I'm trying to figure out if I should explore my home country or branch out. I've got a few thousand USD saved, and plan to work odd-jobs if necessary (my skillset also lends itself to telecommuting if things get really bad). WWOOF and Helpx.net are some tools I'm sure I'll use.

Thailand has the advantage of being cheap from what I understand. I can stretch a dollar a long way. I can also travel to Australia or up through Asia into Europe by mostly-foot. Though I'd have to start with a flight which cuts out a non-trivial amount of my savings. (~$600)

South America (Brazil &amp; Chile specifically) has the advantage of being reachable by foot alone and I know enough Spanish to get by. I'm a little hesitant about crossing the US-Mexico border, though.

Of course, staying in the US has the advantage of being in my comfort zone which is why I'm least interested in this option. The US has a lot to see, though, and the potential to provide a whole new outlook from the eyes of a backpacker around places I've already been.

I just bought my one-way ticket to Heathrow for this summer, and it feels like every day I can taste it just a little bit more.

It's time for me to build a budget so that I can visualize the costs I'm looking at, and so that I can continue to build a more solid plan for myself.

I'll be CouchSurfing as much as possible to minimize to accommodation costs, and traveling as slow as I can in order to minimize travel costs (time constraints are not of great issue to me). This means hitchhiking when I can (I won't be alone), walking, and using RyanAir/buses/trains only in pinches. I feel like this tactic will allow me to stretch my funds much further.

I'm not looking to tour every major tourist trap, I'm trying to experience new cultures and new ways of living that aren't that of the typically sheltered American student. I'm willing to spend money every now and then on something unnecessary (say, pubs or what have you), but I'm honestly not too worried about spending on all my money paying for x activities to do.

That being said, the last great financial obstacle I have so far come across is that of food. In a best case scenario, I could find a way to work for/earn my food instead of paying for it with cash. I know this will not always be the case, so I'm wondering if any of you have an light to shed on what kind of weekly budget a traveler through Europe can expect to spend on food? How can it be done for relatively cheap? What avenues would you suggest in terms of trading work for meals?

Any advice/answers are greatly appreciated, and while I'm mostly concerned with the food questions, I always appreciate feedback on anything else I brought up (hitchhiking, accommodations, entertainment, etc.)

TL,DR: What is a reasonable weekly food budget for one traveling Europe? What, if any, are some good ways to mitigate spending money with work?

I want some advice. Has anyone done a similar journey through central and south America? If so, what advice can you provide?  What are some must-sees and things to avoid?  How long did it take? What to bring(and not to bring)?  Which regions are best to enjoy during which part of the year?

1) Did you plan for it or did you just get up one day, pack a bag and go?

2) How did you manage it? Did you have savings?

3) How did you get around?

4) Where did you go?

5) How did your friends/family react?

I bought my plane ticket, I arrive in Tel Aviv on Jan 9, so there's no going back. But now I'm worried about money and traveling alone. My rough itinerary right now:

* Israel til mid March (combination of couch surfing/staying with friends, WWOOFing, and hostels)
* West Bank mid-March to mid April (working on a farm/staying with friends)
* hop over to Jordan by bus sometime when I'm in the West Bank (short trip, probably a weekend or a week, staying with a friend or possibly a hostel)
* back into Israel and fly to Turkey in mid April
* Turkey for 1-2 weeks; fly to Athens
* Greece for 1-2 weeks; fly back to SF Bay Area

Now I am freaking out because I just got laid off from my job this week so that's $850 I was going to earn in December gone from the trip. I'm looking at $3200 total for that itinerary (that needs to cover airfare within the MidEast as well as back to the U.S., but not to Israel, already paid for that) or maybe less, unless I commit myself to seriously not spending ANYTHING this month. 

Is this doable? I am worried that Turkey &amp; Greece are actually going to be too pricey and I should scrap them, although I would hate to cut Turkey entirely. (Greece I could skip if I can't afford it.) Any advice for solo travelers in these countries, specifically for women? (already read a couple things online for women but they were really general) Any place I should see maybe instead of Turkey and/or Greece that's cheaper and still reasonably safe? 

Funny thing is safety is not really my biggest concern on this itinerary. Obviously I'm taking necessary precautions and it is *a* concern but everyone I talk to is more worried about me getting caught in a war and I'm not overly paranoid about that.

To start, I'm a professional photographer planning on visiting a number of locations in the next year, including Southeast Asia.  I sell prints from the images I create while traveling to give to non profits and the like, and photography is a core reason for my travel.  

Because of this, I'll be bringing some decent gear (one slr, one wide lens, one normal low light lens, one telephoto).  That is something I won't skimp on. 

For those with the experience, what's the best way to carry it around?  I'm thinking of getting a waist bag to carry the gear I'm using (when I'm shooting), while using my backpack for all my clothes and such.  

Second, how should I plan to keep my gear safe from theft?  I'm mostly worried about leaving it in hostels or someone's hands when I'm doing water activities or just don't want to lug everything around.

I recently had a nightmarish experience abroad that curiously and unexplainably landed me in jail for a few days before being deported home. (No, I did NOT break a single law, of this I can assure you!). I had chosen to not bring a phone with me for this trip and I paid the price for it, quite literally out of pocket on a payphone, among what I consider to be emotional and mental payments as well.

Anyways...

In two weeks I'm heading to Australia, and I'll be there for a year or so. Before I left on my last trip, which incidentally was my first, I had not believed a cell phone was really necessary (I have my own ways of contacting home....usually). But now, I can't make up my mind. Some people have told me how useful a cell phone is for the solo traveler, calling people you may know or have recently met in a given area for a ride or a place to stay or even just hanging out. Not to mention the ability to call home without necessarily paying six bucks a minute for it.

I'm wondering what you all think about how a cell phone fits into extended trips across the globe, spanning multiple countries (I'll hopefully be continuing on to SE Asia after my time in Oz.)? Is it better to get an international plan in the States? Better to get a local plan in a country if I'll be there for a little while? Still better to not have a phone at all? Pros and cons across the board are what I'm looking for, as well as hopefully a recommendation for a plan if you have a good one!

**TL;DR: Heading out for an extended trip soon, can't decide if I should bring a cell phone with me, and if so, what the best plan for a globe-trotter is.**

Once I get there, I'm just gonna wander the world. No return date, no real deadlines, no set pace or destination, just wandering.

More background: I'm a 21 y/o white kid from suburban America who has never done anything like this. I feel compelled to change something significant about my life and travel/vagabonding/world experience seems like an avenue to answers for me. I understand that travel of this nature invokes material risk of all sorts, and that anything I bring is liable to be taken from me. I'm not bringing anything that I'm not prepared to lose but I would like to avoid loss of things like my laptop (read: connection to family/massive storage of travel stories/etc etc) and my sketchbooks and....clothing and tent and what have you.

The issue is that the closer the beginning of this wandering comes, the more and more my family seems to be placing fear about it in my head. What if you get x stolen? What if you get mugged? What if you have to put your bag on top of the bus? What if you fall asleep on the train? What if what if what if what if what if what if - 

It just doesn't stop.

I know that I will more than likely experience material loss. It's just really starting to dawn on me that I will actually be living out of a fabric backpack for the foreseeable future, and there's something significant about that. If I have a fistful of Euros stolen, well, c'est la vie. If I have my passport stolen, it's some time spent at some embassy and probably frustration but not the end of anything experiential. I feel like if I lose my computer, however, I lose a capability to log my travels and see the occasional friendly face back home; I lose the ability to have any semblance of convenience in planning the next step of my trip on Workaway or CouchSurfing or HitchWiki or whatever. If my sketchbook is stolen, my creative expressions are gone with it.

Quick addendum: Yes, I know internet cafes are quite ubiquitous, but that is one hassle I would reeeeeaaaaally like to avoid if I could. 

TL;DR: How do you avoid the loss of important possessions to you while you are traveling? Mental traits or physical exercises or.....?

I've already got a place at a great uni starting 2014, so the idea until then is to work and travel.

The first challenge is finding a job. I'm hoping to save around £6000 up until February and then travel from spring to summer.

I'd like to travel to New Zealand and Canada, and SE Asia and some of Europe (I'm from the UK). If possible I'd try to find a part-time job in the English-speaking countries.

A few questions:

* If I'm staying in a country for a long period of time (&lt; 2 months), what's the best way to find semi-permanent accommodation? I'd like to stay in hostels to meet people, but I thought hostels were only for a couple of nights. I'd probably only stay in the same place for 1 or 2 weeks.
* Is it a good idea to use these gap year companies? If I did it would take a small chunk out of my budget, although if I didn't I'd have to organise it myself (it doesn't seem like they do a lot anyway...) and I'd lose out on meeting people doing the same scheme.

What do you guys think?

I'm thinking that I can wear quick-dry light-weight undergarments, decent but lightweight and breathable clothing. Lightweight jacket since it's early March. Passport, ID, credit card, currency, smartphone, ultrathin USB power adapter, pack of plastic hygiene foot covers for showering. I don't need to carry washing/shaving products since I'm staying in large cities and travel products will be easy to find if needed. Wash daily, wash undergarments near daily--since it's quick-dry it's very easy, clothes can probably survive a few days without washing but I can buy clothes if I need.

There I walked around a lot, it was very cold, I had a few meals with other travelers at the hostel I stayed at, those were ok conversations, and I drank the entire time, which was expensive.

I had a good time but I've always wanted to travel more. I'm talking around the world, mostly on foot. I realize that taking flight completely out of the equation (I'm in Melbourne, Australia) is ridiculous but for the most part I want to travel overland. I feel like I'd have a much more interesting experience transitioning from one culture to another rather than just lifting off from one and landing in another.

Recently I had a health scare and while I'm okay (besides needing to slim down a bit) it was a bit of a wake up call that I'm closer to 30 than I am 20 and that if I'm going to get out and see the world I'd like to do it and not wake up one day and realize that I've worked the majority of my life in an office and hardly done a thing.

I'm 27. Not that old (though I feel it sometimes) and I've still got a few years before I'm too old for most of those 'work abroad' programs that a whole host of countries seem to offer. But the people I see getting out and doing the hostel thing are younger than me so I wonder, how old is too old to get out and go?

I'm not in debt but my savings are minimal, I'm working on saving up some more. I'm getting my shit together. But it'll take me a while to save up, especially to do what I want to do. I've considered just selling all my stuff once my lease is up and taking off but the forward-thinking part of me is wary of such plans. I'm worried I won't save up the money before I'm in my 30s.

I am very well traveled, I've been all over Europe and went to Japan/S.Korea last fall. 

I have never traveled solo before (except on business trips), it's always been with friends.  I really enjoy traveling with friends or a boyfriend-- I enjoy having someone to share experiences and meals with.  As I get older, I find myself with a lot of vacation time and less people available to travel with.

Before I invest the time and funds, I am trying to figure out whether I would actually enjoy traveling alone.  I think I would be ok during the day-- sightseeing or shopping, even stopping for a quick lunch.  But I really dislike eating dinner alone-- I've tried it on business trips, with a book or ipad, but it is simply not enjoyable for me.  I feel a little awkward and even  a little lonely.  I'm also worried about being lonely in general-- I get plenty of alone time living on my own in nyc, not sure I need more of it on vacation.  

As I read through the posts here, most of you are really young and staying at hostels where it seems really easy to meet people.  At this stage in my life, I have no interest in staying in a hostel, but I would still love to meet people around my age.  When I travel with friends (or even out with friends in nyc) I am very social and love meeting new people in any situation, no one thinks I am shy.  On my own, I have much harder time.  I would probably rent a small flat or stay in a mid-range hotel, I can't imagine these would help me meet anyone.  

Does anyone have any thoughts for me, or ideas on how to meet people when you can't rely on the hostels?  I would probably hit a European city-- I am considering Paris, Stockholm or Vienna, but haven't decided on anything.  

Just  a little more on what I am like. Not a fan of group travel or tours.  I love fashion, eating well, pilates and dance (I usually take ballet classes 5x/week but am recovering from an injury so my initial idea of meeting people by taking classes is out for some time).

I've been on previous short trips to the states and Canada before so the culture isn't entirely alien to me. But I've never properly backpacked anywhere!

My trip will be for three months where at first i'll be flying to Toronto, Canada and staying with family in nearby Ottawa. From their i'll fly to Vancouver and travel down the west coast by train and coach stopping at Seattle, Portland, San Fran, San Jose, Yosemite/Lake Tahoe, LA and San Diego. 

From San Diego I will be flying across to Houston, Texas, Austin and then finally Dallas before eventually returning home.

My main aim is to just explore and have fun, I know being 20 will mean i'll be missing out on drinking and other things but right now for me is the perfect time to go abroad. I love the culture in America and I want the chance to fully divulge myself in everything American (and Canadian). I plan on mainly staying in Hostels and using airbnb.com for places to stay (aswell as camping in the national parks).

My total budget for the trip is around $6000 dollars so I hope that covers me for the entirety of it. So my question for everyone here is are there any last minute preparations I need to take that I may have overlooked? are there any suggestions people have to add to my trip or improve my time backpacking? Or any words of wisdom from experienced travelers will be hugely appreciated!

After years of dreaming and months of planning, my departure date has finally arrived. I'm from South Africa. I finished high school a few months ago and decided to take a gap year. I plan on traveling through parts Africa and Europe later this year, but tomorrow I fly to the States (specifically New York) for the second time in my life (last time was 2010), but this time on my own. I have enough money for two months. I can't spend wildly and have to watch my money, but I won't have to live uncomfortably. I'm traveling there for two months and, although I don't have my exact itinerary or travel plans worked out yet, I have an idea of what I want to do:

New York - Providence - Boston - Washington, DC - Cleveland (maybe) - Chicago - Denver (staying with family for 2 weeks) - Las Vegas - San Diego - Los Angeles - Monterey - San Francisco - Seattle (maybe)

I have a few questions, but I would appreciate any and all advice:

1) Accommodation - I've booked for a hostel in New York and a motel in providence. Are hostels and motels always the best option for budget-conscious solo travelers? And would it be okay if I booked as I traveled, a few days before I get to the place?

2) Transport - I'm worried about this one. Being 18 makes it incredibly expensive to rent a car. Buses and trains seem fine along the East Coast, but to Cleveland and Chicago could be tricky. I'll probably fly from Chicago to Denver (low cost airlines seem cool), but I have almost no idea of what I'm going to do on the West Coast. What would you recommend?

3) What websites / apps / methods would you recommend for me to make accommodation and transport bookings?

4) What advice to you have for me as a young, first time solo traveler?

- Where to grab drinks (good spots to meet others)

- Must see historical destinations

- Amazing photo opportunities

Last week, she ended up getting a job, which caused me to have to cancel the trip to Galveston. Not wanting to waste the weekend at home, I began to brainstorm ideas of where I could go.

After a sitting on google maps for a few hours, I settled on an itinerary that would bring me to Houston on Thursday night, Del Rio on Friday night, El Paso on Saturday night, Roswell on Sunday night, before making a speed-run back to Louisiana all day Monday.

After getting off work on Thursday, I picked up a rental car ($150 for the whole weekend) and set out to my cousin's house in Houston. 

I woke up early Friday morning and after grabbing some coffee and gas, I [headed toward San Antonio](http://i.imgur.com/FAJVLh.jpg). Along the line, I [stopped for a quick bite to eat](http://i.imgur.com/o5GjYh.jpg). I made it to San Antonio by noon, parked my car and worked my way across the downtown to [check out the Alamo](http://i.imgur.com/Y4MNbh.jpg). After a little more wandering, I [followed the River Walk](http://imgur.com/a/6YEAO#27) back to my car. By 6PM, I was on the road towards Del Rio. As I passed through the town of Hondo, I grabbed some really [good Mexican food](http://i.imgur.com/AZGd4h.jpg) from [Azteca Restaurant](http://i.imgur.com/50RBqh.jpg). I made it to Del Rio around 10PM.

The next morning, I grabbed some coffee and a few bottles of water before heading  west toward Sanderson. After [crossing the Pecos River](http://i.imgur.com/Ky1CWh.jpg), there was almost [no sign of human life](http://i.imgur.com/C9xH3h.jpg), save for a handful of villages with a dozen or so people each. When I [made it to Sanderson](http://i.imgur.com/PcHUMh.jpg), I topped off my tank and took advantage of cell-phone service to send a few photos to my mom, and then left for Marathon to the west. At the town of Marathon, I [turned south](http://i.imgur.com/o3GHlh.jpg) towards [Big Bend National Park](http://i.imgur.com/U0Xsyh.jpg). From the welcome center near [Emory Peak](http://i.imgur.com/Ae7dTh.jpg), I took the 40 mile [scenic drive](http://i.imgur.com/COjRgh.jpg) to Santa Elena Canyon, but [just before the end](http://i.imgur.com/nF2RSh.jpg), I had to stop because of some high water on the road. Apparently I had picked a good time to come though, because many of the flowers were in bloom due to the recent rainfall. A park ranger had told me that this was the first rainfall in over a year. The blocked roadway didn't stop me. I climbed up a small hill next to the road to get a [better view of the canyon](http://i.imgur.com/ff0gzh.jpg). On the [way out of the park](http://i.imgur.com/qxPWlh.jpg), I saw a sign for the Terlingua Ghost town. I modified my route to El Paso to accommodate passing through. By this point, it was around 5 or 6PM. While [checking out the cemetery](http://i.imgur.com/U9zV7h.jpg), I ran into a couple from Austin who were checking out the area as well. After we chatted for a while, they invited me to go grab dinner with them on Monday night while passing through (I ran too late, though). From Terlingua, I took the [road along the Rio Grande](http://i.imgur.com/ag1YCh.jpg) toward the town of [Presidio](http://i.imgur.com/dqQgAh.jpg). After another fill-up, I went north and got my car searched at a border check point (random road trip = suspicious?), continued to the town of Marfa, and then headed west to Van Horn, where I grabbed some food before trekking the last 120 miles to my hotel in El Paso. 

The next morning, I grabbed breakfast in the hotel lobby to save some time and then headed towards downtown El Paso. After parking my car, I [walked across the Rio Grande](http://i.imgur.com/yyPazh.jpg) into [Ciudad Juarez, Mexico](http://i.imgur.com/0X7YSh.jpg). This had to have been one of the [most surreal things](http://i.imgur.com/svL94h.jpg) I've ever done. I spent about an hour in Juarez, never straying [more than four or five blocks from the bridge](http://i.imgur.com/CVharh.jpg). The US customs agent called me crazy when I headed back. Once I got back into my car, I went north to Las Cruces, then east to [White Sands National Monument](http://i.imgur.com/m6rYAh.jpg). I took the [drive around the park](http://i.imgur.com/UeF6uh.jpg), [walked up some dunes](http://i.imgur.com/NUIVPh.jpg), bought some souvenirs at the welcome center, and mailed a few postcards before heading to Alamogordo and the [Lincoln National Forest](http://i.imgur.com/U7AS7h.jpg). In a stark contrast from the desert below, everything in the forest was [green, wet, and lush](http://i.imgur.com/8liLQh.jpg). The drive through was beautiful. On the eastern side, the trees tapered off much more slowly than on the western side, with the mountains transitioning to long rolling hills before leveling off into land [flat enough to rival the terrain in South Louisiana](http://i.imgur.com/CTFHgh.jpg). In Roswell, I checked out a few of the [alien-themed shops](http://i.imgur.com/7Iuqzh.jpg) in the downtown before settling into my hotel room by 9PM. 

On Monday, I woke at 6AM, but somehow didn't manage to get out of Roswell until after 8. I headed south towards Carlsbad, where I made a [last-minute detour to the caverns](http://i.imgur.com/aAwEOh.jpg). I put myself on a guilt-trip over the idea of passing it up (I really didn't have enough time), but *caved* at the idea of how much I'd regret not going. At the visitor center, I took the elevator down to the caverns. Because I arrived early, there really wasn't a line to get in. I walked the [big room trail](http://i.imgur.com/VKvxeh.jpg) and then, because I always like a physical challenge, decided to take the natural route to get out. Although the signs said that the 1.2 mile route should take between 1 and 2 hours, I made it in 36 minutes! I drank a few bottles of water at the visitor center before heading home at 1:30PM. I [raced across Texas](http://i.imgur.com/8T9Awh.jpg), stopping only in Fort Stockton, San Antonio, and Houston to top off my tank. The 875 mile trip only took me 11.5 hours. I was home for 1AM, with plenty of time to sleep before work the next morning.

Looking for feedback on if this itinerary makes sense. I'm leaving in mid/late September for around 3 months.
Obviously the itinerary is not concrete and things can change as I meet people, but checking to see if this is a good way to do it. If there's a better/cheaper way of transportation, or if I'm missing some areas and things to do that are must see, would love to hear from ya.
I don't want to rush places, so I can't see everything that I want, but covering as much area as I can.
Also if it makes any difference on what/where to go, I'm a 27 year old male from Canada going solo:

Fly into Bangkok and stay for about 4-5 days.
Take the train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and stay for about the same amount of time.

From Chiang Mai, going to Luang Prabang in Laos **Not sure what best way is**.
Once in Luang Prabang, take a bus to see Vang Vieng, and another bus from there to Vientiane.
Prob stay close to 2 weeks in Laos.

24 hour bus from Vientiane to Hanoi, Vietnam.
Stay in Hanoi for a few days and then check out Halong Bay.
Back to Hanoi, looking at an overnight train to Danang (then taxi to Hoi An).
Hoi An to HCMC (Saigon) via train.
Thinking another 2 weeks total in Vietnam.

HCMC to Cambodia (Phnom Penh) via bus.
Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville via bus.
Sihanoukville to Siem Reap **Not sure what best way is**.
2 weeks in Cambodia.

Siem Reap back to Bangkok area for Full Moon Party.
Apparently there's a new direct SiemReap-Bangkok route by bus.

Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur via train (stop for a couple days in Penang/Butterworth).
Probably 1-2 weeks here.

Fly from KL to Bali.
Stay here for the remainder of time, and probably check out Ubud and Yogyakarta.

Here's my rough itinerary-

*    San Jose (probably just that afternoon and leaving the following morning, so not spending a lot of time there)
*    Caribbean Coast (Puerto Vieja? Cahuita? Tortuguero?)
*    Arenal Volcano/La Fortuna Area
*    Monteverde
*    Guanacaste area (which place/beach? can't decide)
*    Manuel Antonio/Quepos and/or Montezuma?

I'm thinking maybe spending 2-3 days at each area, except San Jose, which I will probably only spend the first afternoon and get back the day before I had to leave. Which place you think needs more time and which needs less?

I love seeing exotic animals, gorgeous scenery, local culture, interesting experiences, and trying new foods. Any recommendations for specific places to stay or see in any of the areas above are great.

Since August is during the ""wet"" season, just wondering what kinds of clothes/shoes I should bring? I was planning on bringing my tevas but I wasn't sure if I should also bring my hiking boots as well? I'm probably doing a lot of jungle/""wet"" hiking so feet will probably get wet either way, but just wasn't sure since the tevas are open toe. Or should I get another pair of water shoes that's closed toes as well?

Also, was thinking about possibly getting some locks for my bags, anyone got any suggestions/recommendations? Or should I just use a carabiner? This is probably mostly for San Jose since I've heard they're notorious on pickpocketing. Speaking of security, when you are off doing something like going to the beach or canyoning or boating that you will probably get all wet, where do you keep your important stuff - like passport, cards, extra money etc? Do you keep it at the accomodations?

Finally, one last question. Since it's going to be lots of wetness and rain, should I get a waterproof cover or bags for my bag/electronics/etc? If so, which ones should I get? Any other tips on keeping cameras dry but still able to take lots of pictures? Should I wrap in plastic? Buy one of those waterproofing camera cases/bags?

Thanks!

I just graduated and plan on travelling to Europe for 3-4 weeks this summer before starting grad school and I’ve been doing a lot of research and preliminary planning (like getting my passport). I’m a little nervous since I’ll be backpacking by myself, but I plan on having fun with it. I’ve got some money saved up so that my budget is pretty flexible, i.e. I’m okay with spending a little more money for something that’s worth it. That being said, I plan on staying primarily in hostels/couchsurfing to save money. I’m obviously trying to keep costs cheap/reasonable, but this is a big, one-time splurge of mine.

In terms of deciding where to go/what to do and then actually doing everything like booking visas, flights, and rail passes, I’m a little overwhelmed. Any tips on how long to stay in different places, rail passes, hostels, couch surfing, packing, etc. would be awesome. Below I’ve listed some of the trip information to help anyone with suggestions. Like I said, I’m planning for a 3 week trip, but have the flexibility to extend it slightly.

I’ll most likely fly into (and maybe out of depending on price) of England or Ireland and work my way into the rest of the EU from there, mainly Western Europe. As far as locations, Rome is my #1, and but I’d like to have a decent mix of the “big name-touristy” places and the “off the beaten path” rural locations. Obviously I know that I can’t see everywhere, but I want to make the most of my trip and at least see Rome, London, and Paris. Nightlife is important, but not a deal breaker if the place itself is incredible. For example, I think seeing Lauterbrunnen Valley in Switzerland would be incredible, based on the pictures. I really love places with great views, especially if you can do something active to get there (bike/hike). If possible, I’d like to see a castle or two at some point as well and really want to come home with some good pictures.

**Tentative Departure Date:** Tuesday 7/16/2013

**Estimated Travel Time:** 3-4 weeks

**Budget:** $4000 - $6000 (Is this reasonable?)

**Interests:** Pretty much anything active/outdoors (hiking, biking, running, swimming, sports in general), reading (mostly fiction) cooking/food/nutrition, meeting new people, science/engineering, aviation, renewable energy, history, good beers pretty nice too.

I’ve looked at a lot of different sites including the sidebar (and am cross posting to [r/travel](http://www.reddit.com/r/Travel)), so I know some of the basics, but any help or ideas would be much appreciated. Thanks!

I've recently been accepted for an internship in Israel and I was wondering if I would be required to have a visa for my minimum 6 month stay.  On the Gov website it does say I won't need one as a tourist for 90 days but doesn't go into detail about what happens after that.

**Info about me and my position:**

* U.S. Citizen
* It's unpaid (so no work visa)
* It doesn't qualify for a volunteer visa
* I recently graduated so I'm no longer a student (no student visa)

Do I just go without a visa (like the gov website says?) and then extend my stay before my 3 months is up? Though I'm not sure what they would be extending since they won't have any paperwork.

...or do I apply for a tourist visa (even though it's not required) and then extend that after.  Not entirely sure where I fall here in terms of visas since I'm not a tourist. I've been trying to google this info for a while now to no avail.

Any help is appreciated.

So I'm about to leave for Spain for three-ish months. I'll be taking a CELTA course at International House in Sevilla for the first month and then sightseeing/riding a bike/whatever for the remainder of the 90 days. I have friends I'll be staying with who are American citizens currently there on a student visa.

I'm seeing conflicting information regarding what I need to present in order for customs to let me into the country. My US passport is still valid for another 4 years or so, but do I need anything else? Since I'm not staying in a hotel, do I need this letter of invitation thing? Proof of finances? Do I need to show a return ticket? I haven't bought one yet because I haven't really decided exactly when I'm leaving - not that I plan on overstaying or anything.

For reference, [here's](http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1024.html#entry_requirements) the US State site I'm looking at.

The problem is, I have no idea what I should even try to go see while in New Zealand! I hear great things and have seen tons of footage and pictures of NZ and it looks like an amazing place to visit and maybe live some day.

I have some questions pertaining to my tentative itinerary, but also the fact that I'm young woman traveling through Europe by myself.

I want to arrive in Edinburgh (2 nights), Glasgow (2 nights), London (4 nights), Paris (3 nights), Angers (3 nights), Antwerpen, Belgium (1 night), Maastricht, Holland (3 nights), Utrecht (3 nights), The Hague (4 nights), Amsterdam (3 nights), Berlin (3 nights), Prague (3 nights), go home from Prague. 
I have purposefully scheduled quite a few nights in Holland because my mother was born there, but I'm feeling unsure about the amount of nights I've chosen for each city.  As I understand it, since Holland is such a small country, the cities aren't too far from each other.  But since this country holds some personal meaning to me, I want to stay there for a bit longer than other countries.  Should I schedule more nights in other bigger cities?  I figure when I'm in Den Haag I'll visit  Delft since it's close by, and Rotterdam, etc.  Does this sound like a solid itinerary or where should I make some tweaks?

Also, since this tentative itinerary contains seven countries, I was thinking of utilizing the Eurail.  However, France is not apart of the deal, so that makes things complicated.  If I were to fly into Edinburgh, traverse south to London (using the Eurail??), then taking the chunnel to Paris, train to Angers, train to Antwerpen, then utilize the Eurail deal from Belgium to The Netherlands, then Berlin, then Prague.  Also as I understand it, the Eurail counts Belgium and The Netherlands as one country?

At this point, I feel most confused about transportation.  I hear the public transit is very easy and accessible throughout Europe (completely foreign to these LA ears), so in a situation like this would purchasing a three country pass be most efficient? 

Finally, as a female, does anyone have any basic wisdom for my travels?  I have been utilizing couchsurfing to correspond with other women throughout these countries so I can meet new friends, but just curious if there any basic tips. :) (Aside from the obvious, like don't go walking by yourself at night, etc.)

I am a 24 yr old male professional living in Canada and am looking to get away from corporate culture for a month. I have been granted vacation from February - April 2013. That being said, I am looking to travel for around 3-4 weeks as I suspect anything longer will likely leave me homesick :P...

This is my first time travelling alone and I was really hoping for some advice in terms of destinations/experiences that would be ideal for me.

Here is a little bit more information about me.

-Male,

-Athletic (love martial arts i.e. Muay thai, BJJ)

-Do not drink

-Love to shop.

-Love beaches, but do not enjoy ""roughing it"" in the wild or extremely long hikes.

-Pretty open person, enjoy social situations. Usually go to shisha bars locally with friends, or restaurants.

-Not a huge club hopper (since I dont drink) but willing to give it a shot :P. I do enjoy house music.

-Do not enjoy cold weather (sucks to be live in canada sometimes :P)


Many of my friends have told me to go to Thailand. Do you guys think this is a good trip to go alone? What are good places to go to for a 3-4 week vacation? Also, I am not too concerned about money, I am definitely willing to pay premium prices to get comfort accommodation and the best experience possible. Is there a company or travel agency that I should go through? I know some people like to go to Thailand in travel groups, do you guys think thats a good idea?

I think a different perspective is just what I need to get out of this ""rut"" that I am in and most of all, I hope travel can help me find something that I am actually interested in doing.


Positives:

I have an associates degree in liberal arts (it doesn't mean anything in America but might pull more weight in another country?)

I got a good head on my shoulders

Obtained my Passport

I have an intense desire to just get out there and do something meaningful, not just go through the motions at my childhood neighborhood.


Negatives:

Limited funds ~ $3,000 US

Not bilingual (some basic Spanish and German)

No real plan on where to go/what to do (considering SE Asia, S America, and I read Croatia is awesome)

I know that my pockets are lined pretty thin, but how long can I theoretically get away?  I just joined workaway (similar to helpx) and have found some pretty tempting places to volunteer.  Has anyone gone this route as a ""crash course"" of adjusting to a new culture/living on your own?

Alternatively, if I chose to not take the workaway route, where are some other cheap places to stay?  And is working while abroad out of the question?  I have a certain set of skills (tree work, landscaping, gardening, golf course maintenance) and just wonder if I could use them to get some money ""under the table"" to extend my trip.

Any help would be appreciated.  I am trying to leave around late November to early December.  Any other questions just ask.

Quick back story, I am a 27 year old white male, speaking English with some poor basic Thai and Russian. I have worked as an EMT/Paramedic for the last 5 years, in an ambulance, as a hazardous construction medic, search and rescue, and in the emergency room. Before that I worked on cars, computers, did handyman work, taught CPR and Anatomy/Physiology as a medical docent, and popped residential and commercial (semi-legit) locks for a living. I've got to see and do alot of cool shit with my life, like stopping someone from bleeding out 600 feet underground and 400 feet underwater, riding on an ATV in the middle of the desert doing CPR on the back, and helping perform a post-mortem c-section. I am very thankful for all the opportunities, friends, and family I have had. Now, onto my predicament...

Recently my EMT/Paramedic license expired. I don't have any other licenses or certifications. I don't really have the cash or desire to re certify in this particular field. Most medics in this town (Las Vegas) make less than 14 an hour, and I am type 1 diabetic without health insurance. My living expenses are quickly rising with the lack of health insurance and I have no more sources of income besides the occasional job on craigslist doing any of the above mentioned. I really love working in my field, more than anything else, but politics and cash have made it exceptionally hard for me to keep going. I feel like my life is falling apart and I don't have the money to go back to school, so life has gotten pretty depressing. 

As soon as I heard myself say this, I wanted to smash my face into the concrete. I know that lots of people out there have it alot worse than I do. I have 2000 dollars left, and bought a one way ticket to Beijing for 550 dollars. I have already sold most of my possessions, and my affairs are in order. I have spent alot of time browsing this sub-Reddit as well as others, and I believe I have everything I need for getting around. I have made a list of things I have going for me and things I have going against me. 

**Going for me**:

1) I have acquired an amazing variety of skills that I have grown competent in over the years. I can do EMS, life guarding, fix cars, fix computers, fix most basic electronic devices, hang drywall, almost anything with construction including safety, plumbing, some carpentry, pick locks, teach archery and CPR, search and rescue, etc...however, with the expiration of my EMT/Paramedic certification, none of this is 'official'. Also, no college degree.

2) I have no strong needs for 'quality of life'. I don't mind sleeping outside, in the rain, camping in parks or outside of cities, bathing in sinks, sleeping in sleazy area's surrounded by less than desirable characters. I've stayed in areas so bad that I have been stabbed in the face, in the shoulder, and in the stomach. It hurt like hell, but its not something that I freak out about. Its life, right? Just another story. 

3) I am great with making new friends and telling stories. More than once here in town I have went to a dive bar alone and wound up crashing at a new friends house. 

4) I am fantastic with quick-thinking/working things out on the fly. I have a nose for getting both in and out of trouble, and has led me to many interesting times, both good and bad. However, I don't want to be starting shit in foreign countries, it seems rather disrepsectful on my part. 

**Going against me**:

1) I am leaving with 2000 dollars in my pocket, and not much else. Ticket has already been bought, leaving my house on July 13th and leaving the country on July 15th. No going back now.  

2) I have no solid plan, and I have no idea what I am doing or where I am going. As soon as I touch down in Beijing, I plan to visit Bangkok to visit an old girlfriend who offered a place to stay for a few days, and then just roam. I have no way back, and once the money runs out, I know I am probably screwed. 

3) I am diabetic. I have good control over it, I usually let it run a bit high to prevent myself from seizing either at work or overnight. Medication is cheap overseas, but I am more worried about food once the money runs out. 

4) I really have no strong sense of self-preservation left anymore. I have seen alot of death and alot of life in my time. I would be lying if thoughts of suicide (lots of EMS personnel wind up committing suicide at middle ages) haven't crossed my mind. But I believe this to be inherently stupid because I have no idea what the rest of the world is like, or what it has to offer. I figure the least I can do is see as much as possible before making any rash decisions. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing while travelling. Point is that I don't care what happens to me anymore.

5) People are telling me that this is 'running away'. I have no real response to it because on some level, they may be right. I am not as good at life as I thought I was, or I am just so tired of everything else here.


I am taking a small/medium military 35-liter pack that I can fit 2 pairs of pants, 4 shirts, 4 boxers, and 3 pairs of socks in, as well as a pretty small but spiffy med-kit for real emergencies (not first aid) (I will always be a medic first). I have a roll up hammock that compresses to a 2x2x2 square that I used to sleep in when I was homeless. Plus a towel, some rope, a fold-able 6x4 foot canvas sheet, a good knife, and a leathermen. There's enough room for about 2 days worth of food and water (stuffed it with Ramen and 3 quarts of water), plus a small pot that I use to boil water/food when I go camping. 

So, Reddit, I would like to know what else is out there. What should I be doing or seeing? Am I an idiot for wanting to get out so badly? Do you think I can find work, either illegitimate or legitimately? Most of all, do you think I can find a purpose out there, something to change my perspective? I don't want to see the touristy crap, I want to travel through rural areas, learn some culture and language, do and see things I haven't done before. 

Please, share any advice, comments, concerns, or criticisms. All input is welcome, and I thank you in advance.

I'm a uni graduate that's planning some extended travel starting around winter '13/'14. By that time, I'll have some professional experience in my field (online marketing) for future jobs, and will also have money saved up to see the world a bit.

Ideally, I'm not looking to get drunk and go absolutely crazy. But rather, meet interesting people and do things that I can't do in my native country (U.S.).

Along those same lines, what are the chances of me finding a decent part time job overseas to help with small expenses and maybe even prolong travel a bit?

I know there is a lot of these type of posts so hopefully I will give enough information to help map out my trip! I plan on quitting my job later this year to backpack around SE Asia for 4 months from November-March with a budget of ~$6000 USD excluding plane ticket. 

First of all, I am a 24 year old Asian-American (Taiwanese) female who has never backpacked solo before but have experience travelling. Will being Asian-American change how the locals interact with me? I have gone to the UK by myself for a study abroad thing for two months, and went to Peru with one friend to trek Machu Picchu for two weeks. I have been to Taiwan numerous of times and have visited Hong Kong and Japan. 

I know I want to visit Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, and The Philippines but I'm not sure where to start, or which cities to see/skip. I am an artist, in shape, practice yoga, very easy to talk to and sociable, an adventurous eater, I enjoy drinking and partying (defiantly going to check out the Full Moon Party) but can't do it everyday (introvert at heart wearing an extrovert mask) and would like days where I am just sitting on the beach sketching the beautiful landscapes/architecture. 

Things I'm interested in:

-Hiking/trekking/water rafting/surfing

-Yoga Retreats

-Museums

-Temples

-Beaches (duh) 

-The Full Moon Party

So I would love any suggestions from experienced SE Asia travelers for a loose itinerary for me to start planning because I really want to book my plane ticket soon :) I'm sorry if the info I gave is still too general, so I am happy to answer any more questions! Much thanks!

Some stats: I am a 24 year old female with no children and no significant other. I recently graduated college with a degree in Biology. I am not currently using that degree for anything. I am working part time for my parents business.
I have been job hunting for the past year to put my degree to use. Been feeling panicky about my future and I have no idea what direction I want my life to go. 
I have just about paid off my school loans and should have about ten grand saved up by the end of summer. 
I have lately been coming to realize that there might not be a need to rush out and get the 9-5 office job. I have no attachments at the moment and my retirement is pretty much set due to my parents finance planning. This in itself might give me a little more lee-way in life decisions than some other may have. 
I have now been considering an extended stay out of the country for a few months to shake up my life and maybe find out more about myself and what I really want out of life. The time to do something like this would be now while I am not held back by anything. 
I really can’t say exactly what I it is want to do. I am not looking for a magic answer but maybe someone else has gone through this and can give me some words of wisdom. 
I am interested in places in the Caribbean (I am a certified scuba diver and love all things beach), Southeast Asia, Australia, UK, but I am open to all ideas. I would want to stay a few months and maybe snag a part time job to keep me afloat. (Bringing some set-up money with me of course). Maybe I would love wherever I go and move there forever, maybe I would have a terrible time and come home, or maybe I would discover new things about myself and come back knowing more about myself. 
TLDR: I am a girl who needs a change of scenery, at least for a while, to help her on the path to discovering what it is she wants to do with her life. 
Thanks for letting me get it all off my chest. I feel so very confused about all of this sometimes.

Anyone else tried to travel through Europe with no baggage?",SuicideNote,9,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1bqst4/update_10_day_ultraultralight_weight_traveling_in/,"[Original submission here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/176e0e/10_day_ultraultralight_weight_traveling_in_early/)

I'll make this as to the point as I can. The original plan was to quickly traverse Spain, Italy, and Croatia in 10(16 actually) days with nothing but the clothes on my back however the extremely friendly attitude of the Spaniards and fellow travellers made me stay in Spain for the duration of the trip.

What I carried from the US:
1) one pair of low cut wool socks.
2) Sperry's (shoes)
3) one pair of boxer-briefs, cotton.
4) Levi's jeans.
5) Belt
6) Undershirt
7) Button-up shirt
8) Jacket
9) Scarf and (10)gloves

Aside from clothes I brought these items.

11) Passport
12) Money clip (Wallet)
13) Debt Card
14) Credit Card
15) Driver's License (useless I know)
16) phone (plus charger)
17) Point and shoot camera (no charger)

My trip: Landed in Madrid, stayed four days, took the renfe to Segovia on the 3rd day, renfe to Toledo on the 4th. Planned to head throughout Andalusia but only made it to Cordoba (5th and 6th day) before I met up with a long time German friend in Valencia (7th, 8th, 9th day). She recommended a decent hostel in Barcelona so I took an early morning renfe to Barcelona on the 10th day and stayed for the rest of my trip and holy s*** was that hostel crazy. 5 day or so bender with day time sightseeing and maybe 4 hours a day worth of sleep. 

How did I fare? Okay. I'm genetically disposed not to sweat a lot and with daily showers I didn't really smell. Had to replace the undershirt and underwear several times (H&amp;M, Zara, Corte Ingles, Carrefour) and I did one pair of laundry in Barcelona. I also did away with the socks after Madrid since well I'm wearing Sperry's. The worst part of the trip was shaving since I can grow an epic beard in days. I mostly borrowed shaving cream from Americans but I had to buy shaving sticks now and then and so. Eventually I just grew a beard and just shaved my neck.  

Things I noted:

Airport security did not care that I didn't bring any bags, however, I started off at a small regional airport so security is light. In fact, the only time anyone asked about my lack of baggage was at immigration and customs at JFK on my return flight. ""You're not carrying any bags, sir?"" ""Nah, light weight travelling"" And I was on my way.   

Sperry's are no good on cobbled streets, I had blisters by Cordoba.

Renfe Turista Plus is far superior to Turista coach for not much more. 

Mexican churros superior to Spanish churros, imo, though adding hot chocolate to the mix is a good idea. 

Spain is awesome overall and very tourist friendly. 

Spain is cheap compared to France or England or northern Europe. 

Spain is very cold February and early March. It [snowed in the Andalusia region](http://imgur.com/jKtcqwy)! It didn't warm up until the last few days of my trip. 

WHY I WON'T DO IT AGAIN: 

1) Even though I travelled by myself I never really was by myself since I did only hostels and I always found myself with groups of fellow travellers where ever I went. Segovia, an Aussi joined me, Toledo another Aussi joined me, Cordoba I grouped up with some Germans and Portuguese, Valencia Americans, Barcelona I stayed for so long that I tagged along with 4 or 5 groups. Honestly, when I'm with company I like to impress.

2) Sightseeing, heavy drinking, clubbing until 6 and doing that 5 times over, consecutively, in the same jeans and jacket. You just feel dirty and no amount of showering will fix that. 

3) Girls. Girls. Girls. Aussies, French, German, Brazilian, Americans, and a few of Canadians. I met so many women and I looked like crap or at least I felt like it. On my last leg of the trip I met the cutest Canadian girl in the world, well 3 super hot Canadians, but only one that flirted with me--I guess some girls are into that bearded, rugged hobo look. Haha. This girl had the most charming smile and Canadian accent. I could melt. But it was two days left on my trip, I was tired, grumpy, hungover, very dehydrated, and honestly going a little crazy from the lack of sleep. I couldn't impress anybody feeling like that.

-    Is there lots of culture and diversity?

-    A good nightlife? I enjoy bars/clubs way more than I do museums and trails
-    Good public transportation?
-    What's the cost of living like? Is it really expensive?
-    What’s the attitude towards Americans? Is it particularly negative or positive?
-    Any places where the women are especially beautiful?
-    Are there any places where the women really love Americans? ;)
-    How’s the food? Is it spicy?
-    Do many people there speak English?
-    What's the weather there like?

Canadian(Toronto) in need of tips &amp; guidance.,Only_Has_A_Dollar,13,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1a7hax/calling_all_travelers_that_have_experienced_asia/,"For about a year now I have been peeking at the /r/travel  &amp; /r/solotravel   subreddits. I'v decided enough is enough and that I will be taking an opportunity of traveling for the full month of May.

I am a 20 yr old Canadian (Toronto) male.

First off, because of my budget ($2k - $2.2k) I'm having trouble deciding the best place in Asia I am able to go. I have done some research and found a few places that fit decently into my budget. The research consisted of flight prices and costs of living (Hostels, food, local travel). I have found that the locations India, Vietnam and Philippines and a few others in between all share a cheap travel price.

I would really like to hear anybody's good or bad take on these places from your experiences that you would want to share. If you have other locations that you would recommend I take a look into that would be awesome too. There is a part of me that is leaning towards India (Landing in Mumbai). There really isn't much of a reason for it besides hearing there are many ways to commute locally. I would like to keep on a bit of a move and see many new things to fill a month of travel.

I'm an 18 year old high school senior getting ready to graduate and enter the real world come June. I am fortunate enough that much of my University will be covered from the scholarships I've recieved and my parents' savings, and so rather than splurge on a car or go clubbing all Summer, I'd like to take some of the money I've saved and go travelling after I graduate.

I have a love for history, civilization, and culture, and so I'd love to travel Europe for 6 to 8 weeks. I'm well aware that travelling solo is at times terrifying and nervewracking, but the general notion is that its for the better; that in the end it will be alright and it will help me mature.

But am I in too far here? I've never lived on my own, let alone for 2 months in foreign countries. Apart from pasta and salad I'm not the most elaborate of chefs, and as much as I hate to say it, its obvious that most of my life has been orchestrated by my parents and I haven't had to worry about too much.

I'm thrilled by the adventure of travelling alone, and of experiencing new countries, cities, and people in places so far away from home. Its definitely something I am 100% confident in doing, but am worried that it could just be my invincible teenage over-confidence speaking, and that perhaps I need to be able to live on my own, and become more independant, before I throw myself into this tempting ocean of adventure.

I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts of travelling alone for an extended period of time as a youth around my age. Thanks :)

So, as the title states I'm going to Coachella this year. My first time at that particular festivals but I've been to 20 European festivals before so I think the main difference will be the heat. /r/coachella has had some great advice so far. Anyhow, my plan is as follows:

Early april (7-11 or something) I'm thinking of flying to Seattle (quite cheap for me) and staying for a few days, dunno really what to do but the city has always fascinated me. 

Then when the festival starts (19th) I obviously need to get there. I was thinking either train (friend recommended Amtrack) or to fly, if it's not too expensive. I guess Palm Springs is the closest, but if it's cheaper I'll gladly stay in San Fran/LA/San Diego/whatever for a few days before the festival. After the festival it's to the midwest for me, Ohio specifically. Same question here: train or flight? I want to be quite flexible. 

Then when I get to Ohio I will visit my friends in that area (lived there for a year). Hopefully I'll have my license by then, but that's not certain yet.. My final stop will be New York, and then again I want to be quite flexiable. My flight home will be mid-May, no date yet and I might reschedule if I feel I want to spend more time in Ohio.

As far as previous travelling experiences, I have plenty, not a lot soloing though. I have had couchsurfers stay with me here in Sweden and I might try some when travelling. My original plan was to go with a friend (and just buy/rent a car when we are done with Coachella) but it seems she can no longer afford it so I guess going all road-trip is out of the question. Oh, and at most places I will be able to stay for free due to friends all over the place. Any advice would be great!

Eventually, it is going to happen. Maybe it will be you, or a friend or a family member. In some countries it could be something as simple as not having a train or bus ticket, up to very serious charges like drugs or even worse a sex crime.

Someone will eventually get arrested in a foreign country. The reason I am writing this post, is to help YOU when you find out someone has been arrested in a foreign country.

I AM NOT A LAWYER, and NOTHING I POST SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS LEGAL ADVICE.

I was recently arrested in Europe, and figured this would be a good place to post some helpful advice.

So. Here it goes.

If you are arrested overseas, take the following action:

1.  STAY CALM. This may seem like common sense advice, but it is harder then it seems. When you are sitting in handcuffs, in a police station in a foreign country, it can be a very stressful ordeal. STAY CALM. Take a deep breath, no matter WHAT you will be OK! I promise.

2.  You have the OPTION to cooperate with the Police. While this is generally PERCEIVED as a good thing, this is NOT always the best option, however is up to you. If I were you, I would ask for a lawyer WHEN ONE IS OFFERED.

3.  You have a right to a LAWYER and to contact the Embassy in whatever country you are in. The right to contact the AMERICAN EMBASSY is ALMOST as inalienable right as an attorney. ASK POLITELY to CALL THE EMBASSY. ASK POLITELY for a lawyer. This is a UNIVERSAL RIGHT in MOST countries, but not ALL. The PHONE NUMBER for the State Department is listed in your Passport. Overseas Citizens Services at 888-407-4747 (from overseas: 202-501-4444.
If you are held for an extended period of time: STAY CALM. Once you have an attorney, AND have contacted the American Embassy, all you can do is STAY CALM and WAIT. I know first-hand that this is HORRIBLE, but it is all you can do. A Consular Agent from the American Embassy WILL make contact with you FACE TO FACE.
HOWEVER ALL THE EMBASSY CAN DO IS ENSURE THAT YOU ARE BEING TREATED THE SAME AS A PRISONER OF THE HST COUNTRY. TELL THE CONSULAR AGENT WHO CONTACTS YOU EVERYTHING!!! TELL THEM YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY. TELL THEM ABOUT THE CONDITIONS IN YOUR JAIL. TELL THEM EVERYTHING. The Consular Agent will have you sign a Release of Information form. This form allows the Consular Agent to make and stay in CONSTANT contact with your family regarding your status and your case.

4.  Finally, know that NO MATTER WHAT the outcome of your case, remember that people, your Family, the American Embassy, and your lawyer KNOW where you are, and care about you.

If you know someone that has been arrested in a foreign country, or NEED HELP making contact with an American Embassy, please PM me, and I will help you out.

Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps someone!

So!  I'm leaving at 10AM tomorrow for Tokyo.  I have 21 hours of flying to look forward to!

I really don't have anything planned at all.  I'll be staying in hostels but I haven't booked anything yet.  I got the Japan Rail Pass, so I can go where I want, but I really haven't done research, what are some MUST-SEE places in Japan?  Obviously I will see Tokyo/Kyoto/etc.  

After 2 weeks there I'm flying to Thailand.  For some reason I'm way more nervous about finding my way around Japan than Thailand.  

I guess I don't really have any specific questions so this whole thing is kind of pointless, I've just been driving myself crazy in my head for the past few days and I needed to let some of my anxiety out.  Not that I'm all that nervous, I'm more excited than anything.  

Just wanted to thank you guys for your help (I posted back when I bought my plane ticket as well).  This really is a great community of people-- hope to meet some of you while I'm travelling!

Anyway ANY tips regarding Japan or Thailand (or Cambodia) are very appreciated.  Anywhere that you went that just blew your mind or nice quiet spots or places where you met wonderful people-- I'm open to any sort of story or suggestion and will read every reply carefully!

Also open to crits regarding the stuff I'm bringing :p

EDIT:  Oh one thing I forgot-- thoughts on Hiking shoes?  They're not pictured but I have a really nice pair of Vasque hiking shoes that are super comfortable but they're bulky and heavy (especially for low-hikers).  I've thought about strapping them to the outside of my pack, should I do this?  Will it be too hot in Thailand to really wear them?

edit2:  Also a tip for others.  I managed to get (a little last minute) a Charles Schwab debit card (you have to sign up for a brokerage account too but it's free) which charges no ATM fees anywhere in the world.

I'm really big on seeing Europe from both a nature and city standpoint, and I'm not interested in delving too deeply in each city's nightlife (although a good beer would be nice here and there). I love seeing mountains (Yosemite, Zion have been some of my favorite destinations in the US, and I'm craving the Grand Tetons and Mt. Whitney) and I'm invested in learning the rich cultural and political histories of every place I visit. I'm from a coastal city (San Diego).

With that said, I decided there will be two paths I can follow through Europe. I want to know what your thoughts are about my itineraries, and which ones you'd recommend I'd do within my time frame?

- Itinerary 1: Madrid, Barcelona, French Riviera, Paris, Bruges, Amsterdam, Berlin, Munich, Interlaken, Milan, Florence, Venice, Rome, Madrid
- Itinerary 2: Madrid, Barcelona, French Riviera, Interlaken, Milan, Rome, Florence, Venice, Dubrovnik, Split, Greek Islands, Athens, Istanbul, Madrid

Itinerary 1 would lead me North from Spain, then south through Italy. This is the more expensive trip, but it will take me to Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin, which seem to be target cities for many backpackers.

Itinerary 2 is more coastal, and will take me through Southern Europe and the Mediterranean. I feel like this will be a bigger cultural shock, especially going through the Eastern bloc and hitting Turkey. I'm thinking I may add Bulgaria--I want to see some of the run down communist buildings. This option is also cheaper, but I fear my knowledge of only English will be a big hindrance here.",,False,self,t5_2rxxm,False,,,True,t3_1j7cv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1j7cv9/itinerary_recommendations_for_2month_backpacking/,

I've recently found myself in a crossroad: find a new job and possibly move out of my parents house; or blow out all my money in a 2-3 month solo-trip across Europe.
I have never done anything remotely similar so this is a big step, and the idea of the travel rests on a couple of main ideas: meeting new people and visiting places I've only dreamed of. seems like the cliché reason, but more important than that is to get me out of my confort zone. It would be a big deal for me as I'm not the type of person that goes out and meets people in a regular basis (though I DO have friends and am pretty easygoing once I get to know someone).
But, without a doubt the main reason for this travel would be to do it NOW because I'm pretty sure there's no way I'll be able to do it later in life. If I choose to stay and find a better job and a place for myself, I believe debt will pile on and before I know it I will regret not having done this.

Context already set, here's my question. I've been reading a lot about solo-travel, couchsurfing, asking about people's plans in situations like this; but now I would like to know what are the reasons you would NOT do such a trip.

It was to Ontario, Canada, and it was for three days. 

Needless to say, going off that small experience in terms of traveling to Africa is a bit of a stretch. However, I have been dying to go to Africa for the longest time. The reason I specify Kenya is because it contains two reserves that I am extremely interested in visiting (Kora &amp; Maasai Mara) and I've done a bit of research on the country. However, the government has issued a travel warning for us not to visit the country so...I'm a bit hesitant. 

Anyway, wherever I go in Africa, I have a couple of specific goals in mind:

* Go on a safari (by myself, of course; no tour guide, just me and a vehicle wandering the plains)
* Experience the local culture. Specifically, see real poverty face-to-face and, if possible, do what I can to help.

I have a few more, but those are the main two. The former I'm confident I can accomplish fairly easy no matter where I go; however, the latter I'm not sure how to approach. How can I interact with something that is so foreign to me in a safe way? In an effective way? I don't want to walk into a ""bad neighborhood"" and be like ""Hey guys, what's up? I'm a rich American looking to assimilate into your daily lives!""

This was my first year in college nine hours from home. The whole applying process and finally deciding where to go was stressful enough, but I just lost my dad to cancer two months ago, and have been dealing with his illness since the beginning of the year. It's been a total mindfuck going back and forth to home while simultaneously trying to keep my shit together at school, mentally and academically. Also, I'm an architecture major. So, yeah, fuck that. 
Ultimately, I want to travel to immerse myself in a place where no one knows me whatsoever, and I can really THINK. I haven't had time to think in SO LONG. Before applying to colleges I considered taking a gap year, but didn’t think I had the money and wasn’t ballsy enough to go out on my own just after turning 18. But after all this bullshit and living alone for a solid 3 months, I feel more prepared to go out alone.

These are the main ""guidelines"" that I've set for myself so far.

* Biking will be my main form of transportation. I have no doubt in my ability to average a solid 50-75 miles a day for a period of about a month while staying physically and mentally healthy. Plus, I am more interested in the little towns no one knows about in between the big cities than the big cities themselves.
* I am hoping to maintain a budget under 3000 dollars. It looks that I can fly into Berlin for a minimum of 1100, from preliminary research. I then intend to stay in hostels and/or camp. 
* I am highly proficient in German and am learning Italian from a friend second semester, so Germany and Italy are the two major countries I want to spend time in.
* The main things I want to see are, like I mentioned, the small towns and countrysides. I like to party as well, so I’ll definitely make some stops in big cities, but for a limited amount of time. 

So here are the things I need help with… 

* I feel like I have this idealized version of travel in my head, like I can just go and actually survive just camping around. How reasonable is it to expect that I will always have a decent place to sleep. How reliable is couch surfing?
* Do you think approximately 2000 bucks is a reasonable estimate for about 3-5 weeks over there? I plan on only buying food and shelter, and maybe some little knick knacks here and there. Maybe some postcards. But since I’ll be living out of one bag, I can’t really buy anything. Here in the states, something as stupid as going to the top of the Empire State building is over twenty dollars. Is touristy stuff overseas equally overpriced?
* For anyone who’s backpacked/biked long-distance, any suggestions for equipment?
* And finally, the post important question; how much do Europeans *really* hate Americans? Be honest.

I've never been to Asia before. Stuff I'm looking for: beautiful beaches, outdoorsy things like hiking/kayaking/caving, occasionally drinking a lot, and seeing some historical things- I'm ridiculously excited to see Angkor Wat. 

I was thinking I'd spend four months in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. 

Someone told me I'm taking too much time, and that two months is better for the region. Is that true?

Need Advice/Confirmation/Encouragement,meyamoben,11,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1c4f3j/thinking_about_travelling_the_world_for_an/,"I thought about making a throwaway to post this, but fuck it.

I'm 29, no kids, no mortgage, nothing really holding me back. I have assets in total slightly shy $1m, of which about $100k is available to me the remainder will continue to become available to me throughout my life at specified ages. Not self made, I was born lucky. This post is not intended to brag or rub it in in anyway. I feel like I've been blessed with a great opportunity and if all I used it for is to buy a bigger house, nicer car, splurge on more expensive week-long trips here and there it would be a waste, and something I would regret latter in life, especially if I do end up getting married, having children etc.

My dilemma is that I love to travel, but also have a great career that allows me to travel (on the company's dime), but these travel opportunities are evaporating and infrequent, and I find little fulfillment in my career, and honestly it stresses me out, although I have excelled thus far and have been at it for 6 years and have quickly been climbing the corporate ladder. I work for a competitive international company. I feel compelled to work for all the wrong reasons, to amass wealth, things, and spend on things that help ease the stresses of my lifestyle. Fortunately, I now have the experience that I can work remotely/seasonally. 

I'd like to hear from another former professional/trustfunder who indefinitely put their traditional life on hold to travel the world. Was it worth it? My fear is that I'd have instant regret and sadness. I currently have an awesome support system at home with great parents, siblings, friends, cousins.  What did your friends and family think? How did they cope with your change in lifestyle? What did your employer think-if things didn't work out on the road did they take you back? Did any investment opportunistic come up during your travels and did they pan out? Did you find you're able to pick up odd jobs to support your travels or did the day to day travelling not put a big enough dent in your bank account to warrant picking up odd jobs? 

I know a lot of people are reading this thinking that this guy is an idiot and would in a heartbeat hit the road with this amount of cash and never look back.  But this is a very tough decision for me. I've flirted with it for years, but have never had the balls.  I fear by doing this I'll just squander my inheritance and turn into the prodigal son.  I know my career is stressful, and I could always scale it back, but then what's the point of living a laid back life at home when I could do it on the road instead?  Or is there a happy medium that can be achieved? Work seasonally in the US and travel when not working. I live in the states so cross ocean flights are expensive. 

Any advice, motivation, personal stories/experiences, or observations of others in my position would be helpful. Thanks!

Edit: Just to be clear. When I say ""travel"" I really mean living abroad. Moving around from hotel to hotel would get costly fast and I would exhaust my funds much faster than I would intend-like so many travelers often do.  I Would probably like to establish a base and stay for a least a month or two at a time (of course with trips along the way).

So I'm trying to plan a 2 month trip to Europe which I would be doing solo...as a girl. I am an artist and though I wanna say this trip is mostly for self-discovery, I would like to touch a few places that I can learn more about art history - museums, famous monuments, etc. But not too many because I am on a budget and mostly wanna steer away from the touristy, cliche things to see in Europe. I'd start in either London or Germany as I have some family in both, but these are more my bases and I will be spending most of my time venturing out.

Part of me wants to wing it and just see where I end up but I do have a few places in mind that might help you get an idea of what i'm interested in. Im thinking a month in Germany (Berlin-Munich-Dresden), maybe the last week or so in Austria or Prague, 12 days in Italy (Venice-Rome-Florence/Tuscany, San Gimignano especially! Oh and I'd love to see Portofino or Cinque terre), 3 or so days in Switzerland then make my way up to Amsterdam for a week and end in London where I have family so don't need advice for there. And that whole plan is in no way final, just the countries I'm more focussing on.

I'd also love to spend some time in quaint, old-time, and culturally rich towns that have picturesque landscape and architecture, and even take a few hikes to places like the Bastei and through Schwarzwald. I guess the ideal thing for me would be to get a taste of those must see, modern and developed cities (where I'd probably do the museum trips, and most my social and night-life excursions), then move into the quieter, cheaper or more beautiful towns where I can roam around and paint, talk to the locals, meet more people etc. ) and then retreat into nature for a day or so, where I can ponder in the midst of some breathtaking scenery. However, last thing I wan't is to cram too much into my trip, I really want to get a sense of what makes these countries unique. So any advice on what you think i should do (wing it or not), places to visit, routes, how to book hostels, transportation, safety - whateverrr you think a struggling little jamaican girl in Europe might need - will be VERY MUCH appreciated! Thank you!

P.S.

I am just finishing up my degree at University. I intend on backpacking for six (6) to twelve (12) months once I'm finished at school. My rough route plan as of now is England to New Zealand.

I have broken my trip into different legs: 

- The first is from the U.K. to Istanbul. 

- Then I will head down to South Africa and Mauritius. 

- From there, I will go up to India and into the Himalayas.

- Next is to go through SE Asia, with the end being New Zealand (possibly Fiji)

TL;DR version; 

I'm 22 year old guy from British Columbia who just sold his little commercial fishing boat, and who was able turn it into a profitable business. Now I want more out of life. I just realized I have friends from all over the world here in Vancouver but I've never traveled outside North America... I have no debt, no bills, no more girlfriend, and my current apartments lease is up at the end of the month, and I want to... put it bluntly... get the fuck out here. I could go out and stay in nice hotels, fly first class wherever I want but thats not what I came here for. 

Right now my rough plans go as follows. I'm allotting myself $2,000 for living, and up to $1,500 for a plane ticket from YVR to my starting location with whatever fits in my backpack... wherever that may be. There is no really nothing I'm committed to for the next few months, or have to be back in BC for. I would love to travel to Europe, or Africa but Asia has always interested me. Rolling solo is no problem for me. I use to spend a lot of time fishing by myself on the west coast, and see myself as an pretty resourceful person, that can talk to just about anyone. 

This is my question to you. Where should I start?! Cheap living would be nice, and cheap travel from my original location  is even better! I don't want to get stagnant and stay in one place too long..

Anyways, 

Thanks for your time!

I have a couple days where I will meet some friends, and a couple days I'll meet a family member, but otherwise it's just me. I'll be bouncing around but for the majority of the time, a month, I'll be in Prague doing an independent study.

I'm interested in exploring museums and monuments, meeting new people in hostels and experiencing the culture, so I'm not going to be drunk 24/7. If I do go out at night it would definitely be with a pub crawl of the hostel or with a big group, never alone. I wouldn't put myself in the situation of being alone in unpopulated places at night. I have a boyfriend so I don't care about scoring some foreign dude and going off with him.

Staying in hostels. Looks like I can afford private rooms if they are around $30-$40 a night. Should I fly or rely on trains?

I love asian cuisine so I want to try as much food as possible, hawkers market comes to mind. Any particular one would you recommend? Other restaurants/markets? Food?

Night zoo interests me, can I just show up for the entry ticket?

I heard Orchard road is popular. Is it like other countries where malls are social hubs, if yes then I'm thinking about visiting to see what it's all about. Not that interested in shopping unless I find something interesting... Opinions?

Marina Bay hotel. I'm thinking about booking one night accommodation after the long flight just to experience the view and have a good rest the first day. My budget is not strict so I'm good if it's worth it.

I shall be leaving for Thailand next Friday and all that I've booked so far is my flights and 2 nights stay in Bangkok. I should add that I haven't booked any hostel/train tickets yet apart from the first two nights in Bangkok, the below list is just a draft on what I think I'll do. The reason I haven't booked is because I want the freedom to pick and choose what to do when I'm down there, if I'm in Bangkok and I want to go to one of the islands and relax but can't because I've booked a room in Kanchanaburi.

How easy is it to book the day before or even turn up and book on arrival in these places?

Please feel free to give any input you could spare to my travel plans, any suggestions/critique would be much appreciated. If you would recommend anywhere in these places to stay where would you advise? If someone was to suggest somewhere with enough reason to make it a must-see, I'll be sure to change my arrangements around to check it out.

23rd - Arrive Bangkok

24th - Bangkok

25th - Kanchanaburi

26th - Kanchanaburi

27th - Kanchanaburi in the day - Train to Bangkok - Night train to Phuket - Boat to Koh Phi Phi

28th - Koh Phi Phi

29th - Koh Phi Phi

30th - Koh Phi Phi

31st - Koh Phi Phi

1st - Koh Phi Phi - Boat to Phuket - Plane to Koh Samui

2nd - Koh Samui

3rd - Koh Samui 

4th - Either Koh Tao or Koh Phangan for 2 1/2 days (Still unsure which to choose)

5th - Koh Tao or Koh Phangan

6th - Koh Tao or Koh Phangan - Boat to mainland - Night train to Bangkok.

7th - Depart BKK

I would like to spend some time partying but not too much so I have no time exploring. The only pre-condition I have is that I hope to see is some of the most beautiful sights available and make the most of my short time in Thailand.

For the lazy, I'm heading to England in like a month and a half.

Anyway, I have a few more specific things I'm wondering.

1) This is the first time I'll be flying alone and also the first time I'll be flying at all since I was about 10, so I'm a bit nervous. The plan is to get to the airport about three hours before my flight leaves. That's plenty of time, right? Is there anything in particular I should know?

2a) The entire topic of money exchange has me feeling a bit overwhelmed. Can someone just give me an explanation of what exactly I should do? 

2b) I really, really don't want to use my debit card while I'm over there because I don't want to deal with fees, so I want everything in cash. All of it. (Still contemplating how best to secure all of my money...) But I'm buying some train tickets in advance, and according to the site (First Great Western) I'll need the card I pay with in order to pick up the ticket. There won't be some extra fee that means I should still have money in my account, will there? 

3) Packing. I'm going to be gone a long time. I'm planning to take everything listed below.

Main bag: 2 pairs of jeans, 1 pair of slacks, possibly a skirt, 3 normal shirts, 1 nice shirt to go with the slacks, 3 pairs of socks, unknown amount of undearwear, small external hard drive and its cord, extra usb cord, toiletries (hairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant...I'll buy shampoo and stuff once I'm there), nice shoes to go with the slacks and shirt, 3 bras, 1 sleeping outfit, female materials, my extra glasses, 3 or 4 books because I can't not have a few with me, and a towel

Messenger bag: laptop (I don't plan to have a phone, so the laptop will be my means of communication with home) and the cords, a journal of some kind, Weeping binder (Weeping is the novel I've been revising for ages now)

Little bag (this will go IN the messenger bag usually, but also be my personal item on the plane): camera and cords, ipod and cord, a journal, the Thingy (this is the unofficial name for the thing I keep my ID and debit card and crap in), phone (okay, it'll be with me but not activated)

Here's the deal: my company is sending me to Milan for business in March. Originally I was just going to do the week and a half trip business trip with perhaps a weekend trip to Munich thrown in, but a friend recently canceled our plans to go to Ireland this spring so I'm going to take advantage of my free plane ticket and take an extra 10 days to do some exploration. Advice for awesome things in and around Milan also appreciated.

Quick rundown about me:

* 26, never been outside of North America. BUT I do live in NYC so I'm no stranger to public transit and I've done quite a lot of travel around the US (I took at least one trip a month in 2012) where I've had to figure out things to do on my own.
* I've always lived in tourist towns, so I have an aversion to crowded touristy things. If a site is worth it, I'll take the time to check it out (ie, Golden Gate Bridge), but if it's expensive and underwhelming, I have no interest.
* Not concerned about keeping it super cheap/being on a budget/staying in hostels. I'm used to NYC cost of living, which is probably right around where a lot of Europe is price-wise. That being said, I'd say my budget is likely around $2k.
* I have an idea of some countries I'd be interested in, but can easily be swayed by a passionate argument for somewhere I hadn't previously considered. Right now, I'm the most interested in Germany and I'd say I have the least interest in France.
* I know most folks in major cities speak English fluently (and I've met plenty of European folks in NYC), but I do speak a little Spanish, Italian, and German. After a trip to Montreal last summer, I have gotten awesome at ""*Anglais*?""
* super into distilleries and breweries, so any advice on great locales for alcoholics in training are a bonus.

My plan is to do Help Exchange as much as I can, doing only day trips and short overnight couchsurfing in the big cities. 

I do have one overarching concern; when I was in Europe as a teen, particularly in the big cities, it felt as if the locals worked largely to ignore tourists, and treated them, probably rightly, with contempt. I know that this was partially my fault; I was a loud, gregarious tourist. But I'm still nervous that I won't be able to meet and interact with locals. I'm passable in Spanish and Italian, but i'm worried that in other countries I'll be treated negatively and thought of as a tourist.

Are these concerns valid? If done the right way, is it possible for locals to interact with me even there are thousands of other travellers going around? I'll be solo, backpacking, and willing to work, but I'm still worried.

Yesterday I found out I wasn't 1 of 3 placing in the competition.  Now, before I found out (about the same time I applied for the scholarship), I promised myself I'd either go to Stockholm or go on a cross country bike trip in the U.S.

I plan on finding places to stay through couch surfing but I have no idea how I should gauge my time of arrival to the areas. I also plan on bringing a small tent just in case.  Occasional pit stops at motels, although I would like to avoid this.

There's enough cash to get me through the whole experience in motels but I'd prefer not to because what's the fun in that? I think my goal is basically just to meet people and make contacts.

I'm coming here to take in whatever tips you can give me, especially from those who have done this before. How should I plan my route?  Is there an informative blog you would recommend?

I'm Korean American, 23, graduated with a maj. in psych with minors in polisci and peace&amp;conflict studies.
I've solotraveled before but only for 1-3 weeks at a time.  I've been to Germany, Ukraine, Hungary, Italy, France and Austria.
I love to cook, so I'd love to make meals for my hosts if they'll allow me.  I like to have a general plan for trips but too much planning tends to take a toll on me.

Is it possible to actually make money working on the road? Or is it mainly break-even? I've looked briefly at WWOOFing and HelpX and those would be a good option to spend as little as possible.

I plan on going to South India to teach English at a local school, after that I'm going to travel by train to Nepal for one month. Then I'm going to fly to Addis Abeba in Ethiopia where I want to see Lalibela and Omo Valley, then I'm going to fly to Kampala in Uganda and travel by bus to Dar Es Salaam via Lake Victoria, Serengeti and Kilimanjaro (among other places), and maybe I'm going to visit Zanzibar too. I'll be in Africa for 2-3 months (as it looks right now). After that I'm going to fly to Santiago in Chile where I want to travel north through Bolivia (I'm know very little about Bolivia - some people say that it's the nicest place they've been, while others say that it's very unsafe and risky to go there) into Peru where I want to see Lake Titicaca and Machu Picchu. I'm going to be in South America for 2-3 months too. Then from Lima, Peru I want to travel to Mexico City and spend some time there. After that I don't know if I'll go straight home again, if I'll explore the Caribbean or if I'll work some time around Denver at a couple my father lived with when he was an exchange student in the US.

The first three months in India I have accommodation, and in Ethiopia my grand parents know some people, so I'll probably have accommodation there too, but it's not 100% sure.

I'm a boy from Denmark, and I will be 20 years old when I leave, and I have decided to buy plane tickets on the various locations because it'll give me much more flexibility and freedom if there's a place I just love or hate. In India, Nepal, and Africa I'm going to travel with a friend, and from there I'll continue alone - maybe I'll meet a friend or two in South America. I'm from Denmark, so because of the Danish price levels it'll probably be cheap for me no matter where I go (I think).

I'm gonna bring my camera (a Canon 7D or 5D Mark III), a couple of lenses, my laptop and an external hard disk. I know it's a lot of value, but I REALLY need it - I do a lot of photography and it's one of the things I look most forward to doing on the trip. You can see some of my photos [here](http://www.thomasflensted.blogspot.com).

Apart from that I'm going to bring the usual clothes and shoes, a pair of trekking boots, a sleeping bag and probably a hammock after I read this [discussion](http://www.digihitch.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=6704).

I will carry everything in a backpack. I would like advice on backpacks too.

I don't think money will be a problem for me, but I still want to do it as cheap as possible, so any advice on that topic will be helpful.

Do you have any recommendations or anything you will advise me not to do? Any tips? Any stories? Just anything I should know. I forgot to say that I have been to South India and Nepal before. Advice on anything, accommodation, transportation, experiences, money, everything, will be helpful. Also, tell me if there's anything you know I need to book in advance to do. 

**Edit**: I will probably fly to Buenos Aires, then travel to Torres del Paine by bus and then all the way to Peru through Bolivia by bus. But I'm not sure if I'll go to Mexico City.

I (male, german, 40 yrs. old) am planning to travel from Germany to India by train and bus by the middle/end of next year. So far I only have the rough idea that I want to do it, but haven't figured out the details.

I have been to India 3 times before since 1998 and fell in love with it. Since then it has always been my dream to experience the slight shifts in culture by going there overland instead of just flying there.

So far I have thought of 3 possible routes:

* Easy: Balkans, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India
* Intermediate: make a detour from Iran to Turkmenistan and Usbekistan (I'd *love* to see Samarkand)
* Hard: go all the way around through Tajikistan to Pakistan (do I have to cross Afghanistan or can I go through China?)

Has anyone here ever done something like that before? 

Any tips for visa regulations (I'm a German citizen), bordercrossings, public transport availibility, dangers, places I should visit along the way or anything else that just pops into your mind are very welcome.

I've been to India, Romania and Turkey (only Istanbul) before, but to no other country along the way.

Like I wrote: I'm in the early planning phase, so I'm just looking for some general ideas of things I should look into or some first hand experiences by people who have done it (or parts of it).

My car is in good shape, it's a 95 Corrola with less than 80k miles on it. New tires just added. It gets good gas mileage, and so far budgeting an amount of cash for gas is hard to wrap my head around.

With that being said...

I've spent nearly 21 years living along the same stretch of highway, following the social norm of graduating high school and then immediately going to college, making forced decisions that have left me unfulfilled. I've been battling with the thought of leaving for nearly three years now, and now I've either found a catalyst to leave or a lack of catalyst to say. I've made up my mind to go wander the world.

I'm going to be confined to my lease at this apartment for another 10 months (exactly), and will be working full time in order to raise money for my trip. I've made a list of things to do and places to see across the world, and if I am diligent in completing it, it will take me to every continent except Antarctica. I intend to essentially live out of a backpack as I make my way from city to city and hostel to hostel, across the world or as far as I can make it. I will be coasting on the kindness of strangers when it comes to transport and food, and hopefully only spending money when I absolutely have to buy a train ticket or a meal.

So for those of you who have done something like this, I have some questions I hope you can answer and perhaps some preconceptions you can reinforce or help me cast aside.

1. What do I need to be carrying with me on a daily basis in my pack? Some things are obvious; stove, sleeping bag, tent, boots, gear, computer, travel documents, etc... I'll have 70L of space to work with, and I don't know how to make totally optimal use of it.

2. Given my proposed method of travel, should I expect it to cost me more to get started on my trip, or will it cost more to continue traveling? And what are the best ways to get around for free/minimal cost? It seems that the slower you are willing to travel, the cheaper it is, and if I'm planning on seeing as much of the world as possible, then I don't mind going slowly and devoting years to the endeavor. 

3. What do I need to avoid? I've heard that people are often surprised by what comes their way when they open themselves to the kindness of strangers, but I'm not looking to end up like the unfortunate Human Centipede victims, either. I feel that I am resourceful enough to make it through a given day, but I do also know that something like what I'm planning requires foresight.

4. This one is much more open: what else do I need to know? What didn't I ask that I need to know about? I'm not sure how long I'll be traveling or how much of it will be alone - that scares me, just not enough to deter me.

TL;DR: I've got big plans to see the world, living out of a backpack. In addition to the questions above, what advice would you give me?

I did however decided to start the trip on early December and till the end of the year. I’d like to start my trip down south from Patagonia and work my way up north and ending it in Buenos Aires.
I’ve decided a month should be reasonably long and enough. Here’s a breakdown of the itinerary:


**Ushuaia: 2-3 days** (I’d like to hike the Martial Glacier and see the tierra del fuego park as well as take the train)
 
**El Calafate: 1-2 days** (visit the Perito Moreno Glacier)

**Puerto Madryn: 1-2 days** (would like to see the penguins and dive with the seals)

**Bariloche: 11 days** (This is one of the major highlights where it will involve a lot of activities such as hiking and trekking. I would also greatly appreciate places to go, things to do and maybe hire a guide. There won’t be any camping though just moving from the city and onto the parks, forests and hills. I was wondering if there is a guide that would help me out here especially since I have never hiked or trekked before).

**Iguazu Falls: 1-2 days** (I’d keep it to 1 day since I’m only there to see the falls.. not sure if there is anything else to do aside from the falls.)

**Buenos Aires: 11 days** (this is the second major highlight of the trip. It is not nature oriented obviously however here is where I’d like to look to go for some urban exploration, walking tours and maybe hit up a tango class or two and other leisurely things. It will be where I end my trip and head back home).

By getting within these destinations, I will be using domestic flights to reach the cities quickly as I would rather take them than the local bus and at least spend time in the destinations.

Next comes to my problem of gear in terms of backpack and clothing:
Given the weather difference between Patagonia and upper Argentina, I do not know exactly what to pack. Basically I do not have a backpack nor the gear required for the trip. I'm willing to buy the equipment and gear. However I would love for you to recommend me a good backpack. (and if possible, it would have a daypack as well as a hydration filter.. I’m not sure if it exists). 

I’m also unsure of what boots I should buy that is both suitable for Patagonian weather and possibly everyday outings (unless I could have with me a boot and shoes for when walking around the cities). This would also include clothing as well. I’m actually from a middle eastern country and wintery clothes aren’t available here so I’ll have to resort to purchasing them online and hope for the best. I would really appreciate any tip to help me out. Any recommendations, tour guides etc... I realize it’s easier to tell me to Google it, but I honestly have no idea where to begin. I’ll be honest when I say that I have some personal issues and I need this trip to break free from the rut I’m in (if anything, I’m quite introverted but can socialize, and I’m taking this as a solo trip so that I can force myself out of what I’m in). I’ll be posting this in other subreddits as well.

I want to take a few months off to go travelling. I will be taking a year off for now, but i might find that too long and just end it short...I'm playing it by ears and see how it goes. I have the following questions. Also, I apologize if these questions have been asked before:

- Money: I have a Canadian account, although i can withdraw money everywhere, the bank imposes a 5 dollar charge for each international transaction, is there a way around that? I also don't want to carry excessive amounts of cash around...Also, is it best to set a max spending limit for each day and not go over? I mean i want to travel on a budget but i still want to enjoy my self and do activities. How much do you think i should set aside for this? is 20K enough?

- I know that i want to start my trip in South east Asia, so i will book my flight there and accommodation for the first few nights but then what? How long do you guys usually stay in one hostel ? do I book a few days in order to stay flexible or book on a week per week basis? The reason i ask is because i have no plan now but i think i need one...Is it okay to just have a rough idea of the countries i want to visit or do i need a detailed itinerary ?

- I was told that some countries don't allow you to enter if you only have a one way ticket..is this true?

- On a long term trip, do you get days where you just don't do anything? I mean if have a long time to spend in a city, i don't want  to be rushing everyday to see all the sights etc. Do you get days where you just chill in the hostel or a beach or a bar or just read a book? 

- Is there like a check-list of things of buy and take with you in your back pack? i already bought my backpack ..so that's a good start i guess lol

- I like to scuba dive...is there a way to dive while on a budget ( i already have my padi open water certification)?

- I want to learn how to surf , any surf schools in south east asia?

I really cant wait to go on this journey...having all these open questions and planning seems over whelming...

After the timetables of Pukkelpop were put online(a music festival in the country I live in, Belgium), I was incredibly disappointed because practically every act I wanted to see overlaps with another one. A waste of money, to put it in other words. 

So today I found out about Way Out West, a music festival in Göteborg, Sweden. The line-up is so much better and doesn't have an abundance of weird genres. I am seriously considering this spontaneous trip. There's only a few things blocking my path to this suspiciously perfect festival in the Land of the Midnight Sun. First of all, it's in two weeks (8-10 Aug) so I assume tickets are scarce and so are accommodation options. I have CouchSurfing as an option because obvious reasons but I think it might be a pain in the ass for the host to have a dirty Belgian knocking on their door at 1AM for 3 nights in a row. 

So dear /r/solotravel, I want to ask the CouchSurf-extraordinaires, the Gothenburgers, the Way Out West-goers and everyone else some advice on how I should fulfill my dream to visit this magical place.

Just looking for advice/opinions to be honest. I haven't been on holiday for ages, last was 2006 to egypt on one of those all inclusive things, didn't really enjoy it for what it cost.. I've now got an urge to finally go somewhere again but never fancy those drinking holidays that all my friends go to to greece/spain etc.

The one place I really loved and still like the look of is Orlando, I last went with my family when I was 15 and it was amazing.. 

Everyone has told me I'd be nuts to go alone to Orlando and that during the evenings etc I'll have nothing to do by myself and at the parks etc I'll be feeling lonely with all the family's around. 

My main interest was the parks and there seems to be at least 6 I would go to and possibly others too, If I were to go I would go for 2 weeks to make the most of it seeing as I rarely to go on Holiday.

My idea was to go at the start of November as I have heard this is a good time to visit as it is a bit quieter than in the summer time for the Parks etc but weather is still nice (compared to UK anyway).

I would say I am very introverted anyway and am fine and usually thrive when by myself, I would probably try going to some pubs/bars on some evenings, also figured I could use the time to catch up on films at the cinemas etc. I'm 25 male btw, don't eat a great deal so not fussed with missing restaurants in the evenings etc though wouldn't really care of looks etc eating alone.. The Medieval times thing looks like a fun thing to do one evening. 

One of my other questions was about rental cars, If my main interest was the parks etc would it be worth it renting one? I know the space centre/busch gardens would be a pain to get to without one and if I did want a drink in the evening I would obviously need a taxi anyway.. I would be staying on international drive if that helps, current idea is at the Quality Inn/Rosen unless you guys also have any good recommendations?

I guess I am just looking for peoples opinions on if this is a bad idea or not?

Thanks for reading :D

I just discovered this sub and am really hoping you all can weigh in on a trip I'm making this year.

I had planned 2 years ago to do the entire 'Gringo Trail', from BsAs, down to Ushuaia and back up to Alaska (the American toe to tip). However, after 6 months of wonder, I ran out of money in Colombia and had to fly home. 

I've now worked and saved approx. 20,000 US, and want to finish what I left off. i.e. Fly to Panama and work my way north. 

I want to know if anyone done something similar in central america, and what sort of costing I should assume?

I plan on working (if possible) or WOOFing, or whatnot for room/board, and I want to settle somewhere stable for a month or two and really get to know it, learnt he language fluently (more than I do now) and get really integrated. Any suggestions on which town/city to do that in? I am thinking Antigua since I hear good things, or maybe Costa Rica (though I fear it will be too expensive).

20M trying to save up for a trip I want to take through South America next summer (2014), from probably mid or late June until late September.  I am hoping to get a job for the second half of this summer as well as the next school year to pay for this, and I was wondering how much I should aim to save up for this.  My itinerary would basically start in Buenos Aires in late June then go up through Uruguay and Southern Brazil to coincide with the latter matches of the world cup, then up the Brazilian coast, and up the Amazon to Peru, and then north through Ecuador and fly home from either Bogota or Cartagena in Colombia.  

I'm pretty much into more budget-style travel; I've never CS'ed before but I think I will try it out, especially in the more expensive countries like Argentina and Brazil, or else just stay in hostels, and the last time I traveled (France) I learned the hard way the dangers to your wallet of eating out too much, so I will probably be getting a lot of my food from grocery stores (except maybe in a place like Ecuador where the food seems to be really inexpensive).

Also one concern is that I have never been to a country while a huge sports tournament was going on, but I assume prices of stuff will be hiked for the World Cup and it will be insane trying to find a place to stay in Rio, but I also read that July is not exactly the high season in Brazil, so I am hoping soon after July 12th things may get easier/cheaper?

I'll hope I'm not going to bore you with any repeated questions.

I've decided with my last month holiday ever, to cycle from Barcelona to Rome.

It was difficult to find friends who could commit; so I've decided I'm going to solo it, which I've never done before (I've done a weekend cycle tour before)

I have a decent backpack - but now I need to know what to put in it for solo travel, any preferably as light as possible. I'll check out the ultralight and cycletouring reddits too.

Could you please suggest some good resources you've used in the past, or if you're feeling particularly helpful, key necessities you wouldn't go without.

I'll be sneakily camping in a hammock (still undecided regarding that vs. tent - guess that's another question), making my own lunches, and supplementing that with hostels/couchsurfing/warmshowers.

Thinking Germany-Czech-Hungary for Oktoberfest",cowardlylobster,6,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1bi0uq/26m_extremely_interested_in_solo_travel_thinking/,"Through the magic of Reddit, I happened across this sub and since then my thoughts have been constantly, 24/7 revolving around the notion of solotravel. Been reading a lot of posts and have been researching and planning something for my own. Any advice would be more than welcome!

**Reasons for Going:**

- Nightlife/Partying (I and alcohol get along)

- History (was a Hist. major in college for a spell, focused esp. on early modern European history - Renaissance through French revolution)

- Art/Architecture (buildings rock)

- Breaking free of bubble (physical and social); never traveled outside the country except England/Scotland/Wales when I was young and two day-trips to Tijuana. Plus I'm a socially awkward dork.

**Possible Locations:**

- Changing constantly of course, but I'm thinking Berlin -&gt; Munich -&gt; Prague -&gt; Budapest, though not sure if I want to fit in anything else, or if I want to depart/arrive from two different cities or loop.

- Definitely Prague/Munich/Budapest. Prague because I've wanted to for years, Budapest because of opinions on this sub, and Munich cause Oktoberfest+beer. I'm also part Czech and part German (I know, Americans place too much stock in this) and looking to learn more about those cultures.

**Time/Cost**

- Flights seem cheapish from California (I'm in San Francisco)... around US$1150-1350. 

- Thinking maybe US$2000-3000 in additional discretionary spending, depending on length of trip. Probably will be doing hostels throughout, and train to travel.

- 2-3 weeks (12-18 days) is probably most I can get off of work.

**Advice?**

- Places to go, places I missed but should go, best/cheapest ways to travel, etc.

- As mentioned above, I'm a generally shy/awkward guy, and one of my biggest reservations on travelling is that I'll clam up for 2-3 weeks, not talk to anyone, and have sort of a lonely/bad time. Any fellow awkward peeps have any source material to draw on here?

I would prefer a more rigid case, because on a previous trip I slightly bent my passport on the edges a bit (not enough to affect the chip inside the cover), so I would like to avoid that this time. I will only be traveling with only a backpack this time, so it will be nice to keep everything together. I figure that if my backpack gets stolen, I'm screwed anyway, might as well keep everything tidy and consolidated. That said, I am not too worried about loosing my pack or its contents, for I am careful with it, have a luggage lock for the zippers, and keeping track of one bag isn't too difficult.


I spent a long time on Amazon looking for such a product, however the descriptions are majorly lacking and the reviews are pretty much worthless. They consist majorly of buyers reviewing the product before they even travel and have the opportunity to test it out, and those that don't spend the time to look at the dimensions before ordering and thus give it one star for whatever reason. Sorry if I am coming off as crabby, but it is a little frustrating wading through an ocean of crappy products and products that look good but don't have any in-depth description. I did find a decent Victorinox organizer thing, but it is something like three inches thick and can carry multiple passports, just overall way to big and bulky for my limited backpack space.

Flight- 
Cheapest in to east coast? Don't mind where, just need to land.
I've been looking on hipmunk/various travel sites but I just don't know which airport to be cheapest, and that seems to be the biggest price difference

Trains/Coaches- 
What should I expect? 
Are they cheaper to get in advance or last min?
Sleepers? We don't have them here, are they a decent option? It seems like I'd rather use them so I'm not wasting valuable friend seeing time.

New England/Vancouver- These are the areas where I don't know any locals. I'm looking for interesting and out of the usual things to do. Bars are fine and I'm sure I'll be spending enough time in them anyway, but I'd like to see/do things that only happen there.

If anyone would like to show me around a bit that would be ideal. I really love getting to know people and getting to know YOUR city.
Only interested in platonic friendships. I'm bi and generally get on better with ladies, but if you are cool I wanna hang out with you. Don't think you're cool? I'll probably like you more. Pm me.
I will reward you with excellent cooking.

Snowboarding- I will be learning some basics before I go, but I want to get in as much snow time as I can. 
Is anywhere near my route cheap? 
Will there even be snow left in March?
I have size 14 feet, how hard is it going to be to get boots? 
How much should I be looking to spend if I have to buy them?

Charity/Helping-
I don't have money, but I have time. I'd like to volunteer as much as I can to help NJ/NY and anywhere else still recovering from Sandy. What can I do?
Where can I be of most use?
I'm strong and good with my hands, so manual labour is fine, although I'm guessing the appropriate services have it covered. 
Is there any habitat for humanity like projects? 
I can man phones, charity beg, flyer, fund raise or just about anything unskilled.

What about other areas? I hear some of the cities have terrible homeless problems, do any shelters or soup kitchens need extra hands?

I dont have the best experiences meeting new people in my country (germany). So I am worried about spending most, or all, of the time alone in africa.

I am used to 5 star hotels when traveling. I dont think that this is a problem, since I am used to sleep in tents and in the outside, on the hard floor and without a blanket. I've had every sleeping experience, as long as I feel safe I can sleep (Hostels, africa? feeling safe?).

Putting together an answer, I found that this can be related to anyone, anywhere in the world, either at home or travelling. 

For people who want to get out there and commence a new journey or for those who need a little inspiration to persist with the journey they have already started.

Even though my mate’s wanderlust for travelling is indisputably strong, which is an advantage, he still obviously fell in love with a place where he ended up staying for, well, longer than expected. This by all means is not at all a bad thing either.

I for one certainly don’t blame him. There are that many undeniably awe striking, I want to stay here forever type places in this world.  For those of you who are seasoned travellers, I don’t doubt you have come across at least one, if not a handful or more of these types of places upon your travels.

Why do we get stuck though? I wouldn’t say we get stuck, comfortable is more the term and this happens quite easily in a place that has the ability to touch us. A place we obviously love, where we struggle to leave our comfort zone and move forward. A place where we have shared an abundance of unforgettable memories with the incredibly great people we met, all to pack up and leave. 

In saying that though, it would just be such a shame to not move on and discover the profusion of amazing places there are on our planet. Who is to say you won’t also meet more incredibly awesome people to compose just as good if not superior memories with. Because you will, and the more places you go to the more people you will meet.

When it comes time to leave though and that dreaded occasion for goodbyes has arrived. Don’t say goodbye. Instead to those special people you bonded with, thank them for the cherished times you spent together and say “I will see you later”. “See you later” because you will more than likely see each other again, probably even sooner than you might imagine. 

So I say pack up, get nervous to travel again and embark on a new adventure. I still to this day get that butterfly stomach feeling before I leave a place of comfort (staying somewhere longer than usual) to head off to unfamiliar territory. However this feeling also excites me. It’s telling me I am still very much alive and that I have a whole world ahead of me to conquer where new and great things will happen.

What helps you move on from a place you don’t necessarily want to leave?

It's a little stupid, but necessary. I'm 18, took a gap year before college, and am Flying to Copenhagen in the middle of September, with a return flight the middle of December. 3 months to the day! I'll stay in Copenhagen for about a week, hopefully couchsurfing, with a goal to only spend money at Christiania, but very little. I'll have food. 

After the week is up ill fly from Copenhagen to Dubrovnik or Mostar to explore and hang out. I want to do a little research on the recent war as well. 

Generally, my entire plan is to hitchhike north until November, where (hopefully) ill be doing a month long workaway in the Netherlands before I hitchhike back to Copenhagen beginning of December (return flight is dec 17th).

I'll sleep wherever I can. Probably on the beaches in Croatia for a bit, or wherever I can. I'll always talk to people and ask anyway. I'll eat however I can, probably lots of bread and cheese!

The excitement is overwhelming, regardless to whether I'm just a hobo outside in the wintertime, it's going to be completely awesome. Croatia, Bosnia and Czech are what I'm most excited for! 


I'll figure it out, and the best part is that I don't really have a choice. The money has been spent, I realize the situation I'm in and I think I have the right mindset. There's much more details if anyone wants to talk!

Very helpful crowd, and even a few offers to host that all fell through. I then realized couchsurfing.org is now a for-profit company, so I signed up for BeWelcome.org also. 

I've spent hours going through profiles, messaged about a dozen people between the two sites, and nothing has panned out yet. On the advice of /r/London, I have also looked into different hostels, but I can only find openings for 2-3 days at a time, and I'm staying for at least 5, if not 6 or 7, and I don't want to have to be constantly lugging my full backpack around to a new home. With hostels, I'm also concerned about safety, my stuff getting stolen, and as embarrassing and lame as this is to admit, I'm a *very* light sleeper and am afraid I'm just going to have shit night after shit night in a dorm-style room.

I love the idea of meeting and staying with locals, though I'm sure a hostel would be fun too (minus the sleeping part). Money is also a question - I CAN afford a hostel (that was always my backup plan if a host turns creepy), but if I do this for every night of my 37 day trip, I'll *really* be pushing it, money-wise, since I'm saving up for graduate school (I start this Fall). 

Anyway, given all of this, I'm really starting to feel down about the whole thing. What if I find a host and they suck, but then all the hostels are booked? What if I can't find anything?

Would like to see UK, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Denmark, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and maybe spain or other countries on the way.** Hostels/cheap hotels, backpacking, I don't mind!


Hello,

I have been planning to go to Europe near the end of this year for some time now, but honestly don't know where to begin. On one hand, I could take a tour around with an organised group, but I don't really feel like that would give me enough freedom. I don't really want to be tied to a tour group, even if they offer ""flexible options"" like having days to yourself/friends/etc, they just don't really seem right for me.

On the other hand, I could travel alone (I was going to go with a friend but most of my friends have commitments or can't afford to go when I want to). I like the idea of freedom and exploration.

Anyway, my plan is to go to Europe (I'm from Australia), and I don't really know much about how to go about booking things, planning it, etc. I recently planned my own trip to Japan and South Korea with a friend, but this time it involves so many more countries and I will be alone, in a different style of tour.

I'd like to see Oktoberfest (Germany), most of the UK, France, Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and maybe on the way Belgium, Denmark, Monaco, Spain, and anywhere interesting in between!

My budget is maybe $3000 (not incl airfares) or so, but really I am open to any ideas. I would like to backpack around but have never experienced that before and not sure if that would be the best idea alone (I will probably take my luggage in a pack though). I don't know if I can really just ""go with the flow"" and do stuff as it happens, I'd like to have accommodation booked, but at the same time spend enough time in each place so it'd be flexible!

Really I am just a novice at this whole way of travelling (japan I just stayed in hotels and took their awesome train service). Any tips on hostels and such? Basically ANY advice or places to help me book or plan would be amazing.

I'm a 20something Asian female who has about 2 weeks of vacation so I'm trying to decide where to go. I've done solo travel and travel with husband in the past, but this time he just got a new job so he doesn't have vacation days so I'll be doing another solo trip.

I can travel anytime from now and the end of the year for 2 weeks.


Where I've done solo-
Scotland, London, Paris, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany

Where I've traveled with husband- 
China, S. Korea, Bali, Thailand

I've also traveled across most of the the US/Canada as well.

So any recommendations on where I can go for 2 weeks? I know it's not a lot of time so I might want to focus on a few places, and also I'll be flying out from Dallas and I don't want the flight to be too far.

Here's some ideas I have on top of my head-

* Spain/Portugal
* Benelux (Netherlands/Luxombourg/Belgium)
* Ireland
* Eastern Europe (maybe focus in Poland and Czech?)
* Central America (costa rica? belize? nicaragua? panama? not sure which one)
* South America (Peru? Ecuador? bolivia?)

I'd like to go to Africa and more of Asia but I don't think 2 weeks would be enough for such a long/expensive flight.


Things I like/need-

* Natural scenery/gorgeous views
* Interesting museums/historical sights/buildings
* Unique/tasty local eats
* Ability to travel frugally
* Safe for a solo female traveler
* I'm *not* interested in partying/drinking/nightlife.

Thanks!


Additional note - I've traveled solo and would definitely do anywhere in Europe again solo, but I am slightly hesitant about doing C/S America solo as a female, so if anyone has any reassurances or tips or anything for me, I'd appreciate it!

* Spend a night in Macau

* Spend a weekend up on the Li River (Yangshuo/Guilin).

* Take an overnight train from Beijing down to Xi'an

* Spend 5 days in Xi'an

* Overnight train from Xi'an to Nanjing

* Spend 4 days in Nanjing

* Overnight train from Nanjing to Shanghai

* Spend 5 days in Shanghai

Thoughts:

- Munich is the most expensive by far (Oktoberfest prices), so shaving off a night would be the most cost-effective, but I figure I'll need at least 2 mornings waking up there (need to wait in tent lines). Or is one day at Oktoberfest enough?

- Vienna is probably the one I could miss completely, but I want to do day-trips in Salzburg and Bratislava... it'd be hard to fit that in doing Munich -&gt; Salzburg (sightsee) -&gt; Vienna -&gt; Bratislava -&gt; Budapest in one day.

Wednesday-Friday: Copenhagen

After that I've got nothing planned, but I will keep an eye on bus tickets, train tickets and all that, and go where I feel like going, can hitch a ride, have friends living, can couch surf, all that kind of late planning. I've got approx $1500-2500 CAD to spend, and much of my trip is going to be geared towards Eastern Europe. 

Cities that I'm considering seeing: 

* Vienna 
* Prague
* Budapest (probably for sure)

I am a French student and I'm going to stay in California for 5 months for a research internship at UCSC. I want to make the most of my trip so I'll visit CA as much as I can afford.

* I don't care about voice (call).

I've been a frequent vistor to this forum since my last solo trip (Athens, Greece in 2011) and I've just recently booked a flight into Dusseldorf, DE for 4/16 - 5/7. 

This time, I intend to visit several cities in 21 days -- I will be utilizing rail / small airlines for long-distance travel (more than 5hr train ride).  I will be staying in a mixture of hostels and a hotel every 3-4 days for  additional privacy, cleaner facilities, etc. 

Currently, I am planning this route (although it is subject to change). Dusseldorf &gt; Amsterdam &gt; Brussels &gt; Paris &gt; Lyon &gt; Geneva &gt; Milan &gt; Rome, ryanair flight back to Dusseldorf for departure. 

I have frequently read that people suggest to visit 4-5 cities for longer periods of time with historical museums visits etc. I am not a huge history buff, so that seems quite irrelevant to my interests. I am content with spending 2-3days max in each city to experience the lifestyle.

Again, I don't have anything planned in gold, and I will end up spending more/less days in certain cities according to my interests and my experiences while I'm there.

My budget is approx 3k USD. I'll be backpacking and packing light.

I need all the help I can possibly get. From the rough idea I've created in my mind, I am not looking to cover **every single country** in Europe, but certainly would like to travel to the major countries: particularly Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Switzerland, Denmark, and so on. 

The type of trip I'm looking for is not a very high-budget one. The travel expenses will be being paid for by my parents, but regardless, it would be ideal if I found the CHEAPEST way of travelling from one country to another. I will probably have to be staying at a low-budget hostel at every single place I am at. I am not the typical tourist type - buying loads of souvenirs and memoirs from every country I visit, spending tons of money on foreign food, articles, and all that to take home. So the pocket money issue will not be of much significance, either. Ideally the entire trip in total should last 3 weeks or so, not much longer. I am an international school student in Singapore, and so will obviously be starting out my trip from there.

From what I've heard or thought of, would Eurail be the best idea? The problem is though that Eurail either has a global pass, which seems to be quite expensive to me - although I have no clue of the value/way of measurement though - is $600-$700ish expensive as fuck for a train trip around the countries in Europe that I want to travel to?!

Eurail also has the select pass, which means that I would only be allowed to enter certain countries. Two big problems: 1) it's very picky. A certain type of select pass may have one or two countries I really want to visit, but not have a country that I want to visit even more. And so on. And 2) **NONE** of these select pass allow entry into France anymore.

Any help of any sort whatsoever would be appreciated - how I should go about planning this out, how I should travel from one country to the other, what are the nicest countries to go to (especially for a lone 18-year old male as myself) and if some are overrated and should be given a skip, so on.

Heading to South America for 4 months at the end of Dec. Plan to fly to Colombia and spend a month learning to scuba dive and intensively learning Spanish. Then I'm considering flying to Paraguay, writing my motorcycle license (non residents can get a full license that is good for all of South america) and then buying a reliable kawasaki or some type of enduro bike for around $3000 CAD. 

I know absolutely no Spanish except what I have been learning on memrise.com. During the month in Colombia I am going to focus most of time learning Spanish as best as possible for the motorcycle test. 

My total budget for 4 months is going to be about 16-18 thousand CAD. 4 months is just a minimum, I plan to stay as long as my money will last. 

Any input?

Edit: one more thing. I'm considering getting a 35L pack and just taking toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, gopro, spf 60, phone, long sleeve shirt, couple pairs of underwear and socks and hiking shoes with me. Showing up in Colombia with the pack and whatever clothes I'm wearing that day and then buying clothing local as I need it. I figure it's good for their economy and helps me blend in better. 

Edit2: forgot my visa questions. My passport expires soon so I have to get it renewed meaning I don't have time to send it to the Brazilian consulate in Canada for a visa before I leave for my trip. Is it possible to apply for my Brazilian visa while I'm in Colombia? I looked on the Brazilian consulate website for Colombia but it's in Spanish...

I have decided that i would visit here over any other place in the world, so thats exactly what im going to do. Im in highschool right now, but plan to use my grad money plus what ive saved up from work to get me there. I made out a general list of general things id like to do, and things im gonna have to pay for. I did the best i could, but heres a rough estimate on what im gonna pay:

Round trip from Sea-CPH----$1400
12 days in Danhostel----$400
Entrance + random purchases at Tivoli---?
Weed/Beer----$150?
Food/drink----$150?
Bus (if necessary)----$50?
Add this on for good measure----$500

*TOTAL----Roughly $3K for 2 weeks in Copenhagen.

Now, these numbers (other than the plane ticket and cost of hostel) are totally what i thought i would have to pay. I highballed (hopefully) cause i know its expensive there and i want to avoid disappointment.

I am looking forward to going there. I want to avoid touristy things (besides Tivoli) that cost a lot of money. I plan on making my own food from the grocery stores, and if i do eat out it will be at a hot dog stand or something. I will need a bike, how much will that cost? i have no idea.

The purpose of this post is to get a general idea of what i need to go. Im not buying my plane ticket till i have an idea of how long i can stay there. It depends on when i have school off. 2 weeks was just a random time that seemed ok. Ideally, i would stay there for 2 or 3 months, but i dont know if ill have the time or money. How much would you say 3 months would cost? I plan on biking most everywhere i go. I will be visiting (hopefully) sometime in winter or the fall (i love the cold). I look forward to biking everywhere, staying in hostels, and couchsurfing. Im looking to just live there like a local. Ill probably spend a few days in Malmo and surrounding areas. I also plan on seeing FC Kobenhavns play, for its been my dream to see a CL game.

If anyone could give me a rough guesstimate on what im going to need (money-wise), and some things that im probably forgetting. Also, any technical things about being there for a long period of time would be great as well.

Thank you guys!

EDIT: I had a hard time putting this post together, cause im still planning. If i could PM any of you who live in or around the area, or just been in my position that would be great.

**Objective (TL;DR)**  

&gt;Searching for the best options to venture outside of Canada/USA for 2 weeks in late August to Early September. I'm a student with a lowish budget that's open to suggestions on destination. England and France seems to have the cheapest entry point.


I'm nervous and I'm scared. I've ventured out only a few times in my life. I need to give myself the kick I need to start breaking out of this bubble of mine and seeing what is out there. I will need help to pull this off though...

I unexpectedly got the time to finally pull a trip this summer. I'll keep this short and sweet!

**Background**:  

* 22 year old Canadian University Student

* First time solo travelling - been accompanied to Germany[x1] and USA[x4] in the past

**Timeframe**  
  
* ~2 weeks - Late August to Early Sept (Can slightly extend a few days if warranted)

**Budget**  
  
*  Lower the better
* ~$2000-2500 **max**

**Desired Destination**  
  
* Flexible. 

Europe will probably be the closest and cheapest.  I love culture and seeing the sights and sounds of a foreign land. I also love seeing nature (Been in the Alps and Rockies!)
  
Cheapest flights I have found are London and Paris, though I've heard that Eastern Europe can provide a cheap getaway. Iceland has a strangely affordable ticket price. 

**Request** 

* Where can I go to get the best bang for the buck this late in the season?
* Aside from the links in the sidebar, any other suggested sources to prep myself for the trip?

I know it is late in the season, but I have been working my ass off constantly for years with no break. I managed to get about 2 weeks to myself (A little bit more if neccessary) near the end of August till early September.  
  
I am working hard on researching and keeping an eye on flight prices. Any help would be fantastic!

(I just got Rick Steves' *Europe Through the Backdoor* to help.) I just REALLY need some outside advice too.

I'm traveling in Europe for 10 days due to having a conference in Germany where the flights were already paid.  I'm a 23 year old American male who has never traveled to Europe and will be going alone.  I'm not rich, but I'm not poor.  (For example, I can probably afford to stay in cheap hotels if I find out hostels are terrible places.)


I had to book the flights before I knew where I was going, so I'll be free in Heidelberg starting  in the afternoon of July 20, and I booked my flight out of Paris on July 31.  I'm also planning to meet a friend not far from Nice who needs me to be gone by July 28, so those are my timeline constraints.  

So first, is my basic outline of my schedule reasonable?

Tentative schedule:

	- July 20, night: Leave Heidelberg, sleep on train to Switzerland
	- July 21, morning:  Arrive in Switzerland
	- July 21, night:  Sleep in Swiss hotel
	- July 22, night:  Leave Switzerland, sleep on train to Nice
	- July 23, morning: Arrive in Nice
	- July 23, night:  Sleep in Nice hotel
	- July 24, morning: Get to friend's place
	- July 24, night:  Sleep at friend's place
	- July 25:  friend's place
	- July 26, morning:  Leave friend's place and hang out in Nice
	- July 26, night:  Sleep on train to Paris
	- July 27-30:  Paris (hotels)
	- July 31, all day: Flying from Paris

Secondly, I'm soliciting all advice that will help me to travel through Europe, such as:

1. Which Swiss city to visit
2. What to do in that Swiss city
3. What I should do in Nice or Paris (obviously plenty for Paris)
4. How trains in Europe work, especially overnight ones for sleeping (note: I don't know how trains work in America either)
5. How public transit works there (Note: I don't really know how public transit works in America either)
6. Credit card/debit card/Euro stuff  (something about a magnetic stripe vs. chips?)
7. Cell phones (how to call home, others, use the internet)
8. How to find cheap, decent hotels/hostel/bed and breakfast/whatever
9. How much of any of this I can do now compared to how much I have to do while I'm there
10. How to travel with just one backpack (leave it in hotel/hostel/whatever or carry it with me at all times)
11. Anything else.

I know that the temperatures in Spain, at least in the southern bit, would be really good for that time of year and they would be a little cold in Germany, but coming from the prairies I am no stranger to temperatures colder than it ever gets over there.

•	June 7th-London-&gt;Anatalya, Turkey

•	9th- Ferry across to Athens

•	11th- Bus up the west coast of Greece to Albania

•	12th-16th-Going up the coast of Albania (Ksamil, Sarande, Tirana)

•	16th-19th- Montenegro, here i'm thinking about staying along the coast. Not sure which towns to go to yet though.

•	20th- 24th- Croatian coast (Dubrovnik, Zadar, Rijeka, or Zagreb). Might skip Bosnia unless there is something on the west coast that is a must see.

•	24th- 26th- Through Slovenia to Graz, Austria.

•	27th- Up to either Prague or Munich. Havn't decided yet.

--

Now it's 5:23 on 10/18 and im in Kuty Slovakia. Lol I tried to pull a manuv b/c my eurail pass isn't valid in Slovakia but I got pwned.

So I was totally unaware that this pass isn't valid here until I was already in the country and the ticket guy asked for mine. This must have been as soon as we crossed the border from Hungary from Budapest - a city I think I have to come back and visit.

So once the guy told my ticket was bad, he said I could have paid him 70 euros to stay on, but I have no cash. I was supposed to get off on the next stop but instead I jumped into the bathroom and locked myself in there. I was prepared to sit in there until we got into the Czech Republic haha. I was in there for about an hour until the second ticket guy knocked and finally unlocked the door.

I tried to play it off like I fell asleep on the toiled and that I didn't know the ticket was bad. All things considered he was actually pretty nice about the whole thing.

While I was in there, prolly 10 people knocked or tried to open the door. I was so fucking nervous - thinking worst-case scenario I would be arrested and charged an inordinate amount of money.

Instead, I'm here just short of the land of the free in Kuty. I don't even want to look out the front door, but judging from the people walking through the lobby this seems like a nice, quiet suburb town. I don't feel threatened one bit but I don't wanna leave the lobb. Turns out a ticket to Praha from here is only 21 euro so I guess I saved myself 50 euro w/ the bathroom maneuver haha.

Ive had a fuckup on every train ride so far, pretty chu. First was me and fiend going to Vienna instead of munich and then second fuck b/w Munich and Budapest was so chu now. Comedy = tragedy + time.

So once I reserved my seat #86 from Munich I found it and was sitting down when this 60+ year old Romanian dude named john came on to the train w/ 4 of the heaviest bags Ive ever seen. He was supposed to be sitting in the seat in front of me, but instead he put 3 of his bags on the 2 seats in front of me. Once he finished lugging all of his shit he sat down next to me.

""Moment,"" he said, ""Moment."" Well, that moment turned out to be an 8 hour moment, all the way to Budapest. At first, this guy was pouring sweat and understandably so, his bags were the heaviest ever.

Once we get going for a lil bit he asks me, ""Is your home in Budapest?"" in broken english. I say ""No, San Francisco"" and he's like ""ahhhh california,"" with the accompanying hand motion like he was wafting in the smell of chu ness or something. He would do this hand motion throughout the train ride to signify when he thought something was dominant, like when he went through salzburg and said ""Music the best"" and did the hand thing. Then he asked me if I liked reggae and I said not really.

His name was john and he had a kid my age and offered me a sandwich and started calling me friend and that he liked my name. ""Strong name "" he said.

Turns out he was setting me up for one of the most chu cons of all time. Alex Montana, the canadian living in Florence, wanred me about the Romanians in Florence when I asked him if Hungary was safe. ""Hungarians aren't as bad as the Romanians, bro. The worst.""

So I was gonna be a nice guy and help him w/ his heavy ass bags off the train. I tried to tell him I would only help him off the train and that I would help him on the new one but that didn't translate. At one point he asked me to carry his shit for 100 meters.

I ended up lugging that shit for about a quarter mile or even more. Worst thing was our train was late and he had a connecting one with about 15 minutes to make it. 

I could only imagine how funny it must have looked to see me raging and dying as I helped this guy out. Not only did I have to carry my big ass backpack full of shit and my smaller day bag, but I had to lug 2 of the heaviest bags of all time. The whole time I was yelling ""Fuckkk Ro Fucking Manians"" it took about 10 minutes to get off our platform and circle around another one. The worst part was that he could have got on the train about 8 long ass cars before he did. Once I got close to the end I considered giving up and started yelling ""Get on the fucking train!"" Quite a chu scene.

Eventually I brought him to one car short of where he entered and I just gave up and we had a lil hug and he did the lil euro kiss on the cheek thing. at least he was very appreciative, as he said Danke about 40 times on the train ride.

But that wasn't the end of the chuness. After I sat on a bench for about 10 or fifteen minutes to gain my breath and relax I went to the sketchiest lil eastern european bathroom and took a pill of adderral, changed clothes but dropped my tooth brush on accident and gave it up.

Then I exchanged my money and realized how ridic Hungarian forents are. I turned in 70 euro and got 16,000 in return. Lol some sketchy ass guy sat next to the exchange and asked me if I wanted to exchange w/ him but I didn't even acknowledge.  Actually this happend before the bathroom because I had to pay 100 forent to use it to this prolly 17 year old kid sitting w/ his laptop in the bathroom. I thought I had shitty jobs before. 

After that I tried hella hard to buy a ticket but couldn't. I went to a couple info desks and tried to buy one outside but the machine stole my money and I asked for help  from this hot local girl smoking a cig on a bench but again was lost in translation.

I then went back inside and saw this other automated machine and asked one guy if it was a bus machine and he said yeah. I tried to work it but couldn't, asked another girl who spoke better english and she told me it was for a local train. Greaat. 

Then I walked outside and called up Dope for help but then I said fuck it and jumped on a bus. I had been on for about 5 min when these 2 huge guys in leather jackets started staring at me and saying something in their native tongue. ""They're gonna try to steal my shit"" I thought.  

Then they busted out these blue armband things and asked for my ticket. I didn't have one so I had to get off at the next stop with them.

""In our country you pay before. This is hungary,"" in thick accent. He was tryna intimidate me and it kinda worked. 

Then I explained my situation and he told me the fine was usually 12k but that since I had just got into town he would lower it to 6K.  As it turns out I was on the right bus going the wrong direction. ""This is the old city,"" he said pointing down the street. I told him i was tryna get to Urbania (Ur-bay-nia) and he's like ur-bah-nia? You need to cross the street.

So I paid my fine crossed the street and took the next bus to Urbahnia. He gave me a ticket and I thanked him for helping me out.

(Now I have 30 mins til I get on the train to Prague, only 3.5 hours to go. I've been listening to Illmatic stkop and its on represent for the second time now. things could be worse. I could be in federal-pound-me-in-the-ass prison slovakia style haha).

Once I got off at urbania I asked 2 canadian girls if they knew where my hostel was. They tried to help out but I asked a local guy walking by and he told me it was just another street down. the girls were staying at big fish pub and they seemed like they had a lil inkling to hangout but we didnt and Ill never see them again. from our brief interaction i could tell they were very nice girls.

I finally made it to the hostel, walked in to the jungle and into the bar, which was covered with a circus tent kinda thing and a bartender was like ""check in!"" Ellen, a brunette, helped me initially before Alex took over and took me to the common room.",,False,self,t5_2rxxm,False,,,True,t3_1cx93c,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1cx93c/share_your_journal_stories/,

I have been lurking on this sub the past few months and finally worked up the courage to ask a few questions of my own. 

I know this may seem like an odd question, but how long would it take to best prepare to spend about 6 months to a year travelling (mainly in Europe). Assuming I already have a valid US passport and general funds to cover thrifty living.

My plan at the moment is to spend a few weeks in a handful of cities and just live, for lack of a better description. However, I am unsure of a few things:

**Transport:**

* Should I buy a Europe Rail Pass?
* Considering my duration, are there any countries that require me having a visa?
* What are the best cities to fly into? Cheapest?
* Best times to buy? Best day to fly? Is further in advance always cheaper?

**Lodging:**

* Should I reserve hostel spots in larger cities?
* Follow-Up, should I reserve hostels and plan my travels around them?

**Pack and Gear:**

* Can I survive on a backpack worth of clothes?
* Do hostels have laundry services? 2
* Figuring a about 3-4 ""outfits"" worth of clothes (i.e. 3 shirts, 2 pants, 1-2 shoes, etc.)

**Health and Safety:**

* I am 6'4"" (193 cm) generally healthy guy, any concerns besides general crime (pickpockets, scams etc.)
* Should I talk to my general physician before leaving for shots? How long should that take?
* Health Insurance in case of an emergency, I am currently covered under my parents until 26, how does that transfer to Europe, if at all?

**Downtime:**

* I want to get back into reading, would it be ""safe"" to buy a Kindle or would that make me a target?
* I am an *amateur* photographer, would it be ""safe"" to carry a camera throughout my travels?
* I assume most hostels have WiFi, as well as some coffee shops, what other ways can I stay in touch with family?
* Considering doing a blog to document my journey, teach others who want to do it, and stay in touch with family, any concerns there I maybe haven't foreseen?

**Finances:**

* How much is a ""low to comfortable"" budget? (Assuming airfare, hostels most nights, maybe a splurge dinner once a week?)

**Language:**

* I did a semester in Spain, and that is my intended ""starting point"", my Spanish is a little rusty though, should I be concerned?


I have always wanted to travel solo (or at least get some time to just be on my own) and I think it will be challenging. Also I am considering deferring graduate school for a year to do this journey, but I don't think I will ever have a better chance.

Anyways, I just need some advice overall, and perhaps a little reassurance that this path isn't a colossal mistake in the making! :)

Thanks!!!

TLDR: First time solo traveler, I'd love some ""beginner/general advice""!

I am going to costa rica on monday for about 10 days. This is going to be my first time doing a solo trip. 

I wanted to ask a couple of questions about Costa Rica and about solo travel.

1. I would like to spend a few days at a hotel/B&amp;B that has yoga. I don't want to spend my entire vacation on a yoga retreat, but would like to spend a few days doing some yoga and meditation. Has anyone ever done this before? I'm guessing Nosara or Manuel Antonio are probably the best places for this, would you guys disagree or have better better suggestions?

2. I have stayed in hostels before, with friends, and never really met people. The only time I normally meet people is when I am on the day trips. How do you meet people in hostels? Do you have to stay in the dorm rooms?

3. Have any of you gone to Corcovado National Park? I want to see the animals and practice my photography skills. I am not a crazy hiking person (don't like going for days at a time), but I don't think I'm totally out of shape either. Do you think it is worth my time to visit? Or should I just stick to Monteverde? 

4. I want to try to get in as much in as possible for my trip, so I was thinking of taking flights to get around the country. Do you guys think I would be saving that that much time? Also, what airline is the best for flying around?

5. I like to rock climb and would love to get in some out door rock climbing while I'm down there. Do you guys know of any reputable tour groups that I could go with? That way I don't have to bring anything but my shoes and harness.

I've been here a few times asking random questions about traveling, and now I've come armed with the early makings of a trip, and of course, I need some additional help.

Come July 1st, my lease in my current apartment will end, and I will become 'homeless', allowing me to head out on a trip I've been saving and planning for for the better part of a year now. Up until then, I will continue to earn/save money.

Ideally, I'd like to make it around the world with this single trip, but I realize that is a huge endeavor and likely will not happen in one go, and I'm definitely on board with breaking my travels up into multiple trips. With that being said, I'm heading east from the US to Dublin, and will begin my trip there by wandering around Europe for the first leg, then hopefully on east to India/Asia, making my way across the Pacific and into South America [I was planning on including Africa, but for safety and financial reasons I think I'm opting out of that]. That is my trip, in so many words. I'm trying to avoid specific plans and timetables; instead, I would rather wander as I see fit.

The immediate journey will take me to Europe, which I plan to do some serious trekking through. My only for sure destination is Oktoberfest, though I have considered getting a 3-month Global Eurail pass to allow me what seems to be the best degree of freedom in Europe for the best price. Is there a better way? I know that Ryanair is something to be considered, but over a 3-month does the $1400 Eurail Pass beat them out in terms of value? I'm trying to find the best way to travel cheaply throughout Europe.

Also, I'd like to know more about WWOOF, if anyone has any experience with that. I was thinking of becoming a WWOOFer for my India/Asia travels, though it seems to me that I would have to buy a membership for each new region that I want to be a WWOOFer in. Is that the case?

Finally, I think I have accommodations (via CouchSurfing, friend networks, and camping gear) worked out for the immediate trip, and as far as food goes, I'm building a budget to minimize food expenses/searching for ways to earn food without spending money. I'm not as concerned about these issues (currently) as I am the travel questions above.

I've never done a trip like this before, but I've come to understand that this is something I need to do. Any answers to the questions above or any advice you have to give in general would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: What is the most cost-efficient way to travel Europe without restriction, for an undetermined amount of time? Secondarily, does a WWOOF membership work worldwide for 12 months, or is it just by region?

I know that this question gets asked pretty much all the time, but here we go again! I'm a guy from Finland and I'm planning on doing a 3-4 week solo trip in August. I've been traveling before, but mostly with family (multiple times..) and once with friends (last year, in Prague for 2 weeks). 

But I'm kinda lost on where would be the best place to go. I'm not that interested in traveling 15 countries, being in each for 1-2 days; I think it'd be nicer to just stay in 1-2 countries for longer periods of time.

I've been thinking about Hong Kong. What do you think about it? Would I manage in HK without knowing any Cantonese? Is it a nice place to be? And, above all, would it be fitting for a first-time solo traveller?

Do you have any other suggestions besides HK? Nordic countries aren't too much of interest to me this time, maybe not the most basic European cities either (I've been to many of them.. but not all, so do suggest them too if you find them worthwhile!)... but I'm not so keen on going to a rainforest to backpack in total isolation either, so keep the most adventurous options in moderation.  I have a decent budget, but in terms of flights / general costs, places like New Zealand / Australia would maybe be out of question.

As to what my interests are... I'm not that interested in traveling around different sightseeing landmarks. I enjoy just hanging around places if the atmosphere is nice, eating, maybe visiting some concerts and such. Though museums are okay if the subject interests me; even if they might be one of those aforementioned sightseeing staples... Clubs and such are cool too, though not definitely a necessity in any way. Some places and things I liked on previous trips, to give some direction: the hustle and bustle of Chinatown in San Francisco, going to a little movie theater in Prague, some random suburban area in Copenhagen and the little café/kiosk there, chilling around Alexanderplatz in Berlin, the foggy and ethereal landscapes in Scotland.

1351186175.0,2,self.solotravel,122pu4,This is what traveling has inspired me to do...,nealbaren,14,12,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/122pu4/this_is_what_traveling_has_inspired_me_to_do/,"I am making music based on my experiences traveling. Let me explain.

About a year ago, I was working as a motion graphics artist at a video production company. I really should have felt content, making plenty of money for being a twenty-something, having good friends, being able to support myself. But I wasn't...I wanted to be crazy and do crazy things...to not do what I was ""supposed to"", if that makes sense. I felt too in-line, a little ignorant, and too complacent. I'd also had some external pushing to travel from a friend who had done some before.

So I bought a ticket to Colombia without really telling anyone at the time. I'd decided to quit my job. To just...leave. Some time passed, I told everyone (they got excited too!), I gave my notice, and on December 1st of last year, I flew away to Colombia with little to no plan. I'd always been nagged about making one, so I'd done some rough travel outlines, but they ultimately proved to be absolutely useless. You cannot plan this.

I traveled through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.

I danced Salsa in Medellin, traditional dances with random dudes' wives in Santender, rode horses through huge valleys in the Coffee Zone, did some Ayahuasca (another tale for another time), hiked a mountain in Quito (almost slipped off of a wet rock wall...not good), explored the jungle in eastern Ecuador, fell HEAVILY IN LOVE with a Chilean girl, surfed in Mancora (pitifully), helped complete the road so our bus could continue going, got LOST in the mountains, sandboarded down massive dunes, hitchhiked to Arequipa, hiked for 3 days through the deepest canyon in the world, went to the Nazca lines (lame!!!), climbed Machu Picchu (and Waynu!!!), walked on floating-straw islands, spent a night on the island of the origin of the Incas, saw a massive festival with the Bolivian president, climbed a volcano in Chile, biked through the hills and villages through Bariloche, and ate the best empanadas in the world in Buenos Aires. And that's scratching the surface.

All the while, I changed. The way I perceived things changed...time, situations, people, everything. I associate all of this with music, and especially the music I heard while I was there...which I fell in love with. Cumbia, huayno, zamba, other Andean musics...it's all pure and utter MAGIC.

So now, back home, I'm making my own music to help tell and share HOW IT FELT. I can tell stories with words, but to try get you to FEEL it...I'm making music. It's also to help me remember something so intense and passionate...this crazy and impossible-to-replicate part of my life that I will carry with me forever. It is an essential part of who I am now, and this music expresses that.

To be even more relevant, it's also a fusion of music that I heard while I was there and music that I grew up with, the two sides of me.

So, that's my little spiel. I could go on with stories, which I will if anyone is interested, but I would love if you guys checked out the Kickstarter page where I have two songs and a campaign to raise money (and get fans!) to make it happen and get it out there!

Lastly, were there many other dogs around?

I am looking to do a backpacking tour of Southeast Asia (and area) and was curious if anyone knew when a good time to go would be in terms of flight price?  I live in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, so my options are to fly out of Toronto, Buffalo, or Detroit.  Detroit is oftentimes cheaper than Toronto (Saved over $800 flying to NZ 2 years ago for example), but I'll fly from Toronto if that ends up being cheaper.

So if you know that flying in the fall is cheaper, speak up!  If you know that flying in January into Vietnam is pretty cheap, I want to know!  What's cheaper, when?   If you have flown into Asia before, but not southeast asia..  but it's in the general area, do share!

I would prefer to go at a non-busy time..  right before the tourist season begins would be ideal..  but that's not set in stone.  I'm going to plan this trip around the flight.  I've done some googling but I have no idea when a good time to go would be.

I'd also consider flying into South Korea or Japan, but that's a bit further away from where I want to explore (Vietnam, Thailand, etc.)   I've also always wanted to do some hiking in Nepal, but it seems like flying there will be even more expensive.

Two years ago I managed to fly to New Zealand for $1,600 after taxes.  It ended up saving me a lot of money - that I was then able to use while in NZ.

Has anyone ever flown to Asia from North America cheaper than that?
