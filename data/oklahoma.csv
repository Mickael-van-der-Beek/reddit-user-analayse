Unfortunately, Senator Rob Johnson quietly pushed SB 802 through the Oklahoma Senate by attaching it as an amendment to an entirely unrelated bill, HB 2097.


Please contact members of the House and urge them to vote NO on HB 2097 as passed by the Senate unless and until Senator Johnson's Floor Amendment, which would raise your taxes as a premium e-cigarette user, is removed or substantially amended. The most important action for Oklahoma citizens to take is to contact and speak personally with their Representative.  

-------------

If enacted, this bill would:

* Ban e-cigarette sales to minors, which is a good thing, but would also...

* Tax sales of “vapor products” (e-cigarettes and cartridges) and “tobacco-derived products” (e-liquid and cartomizers containing nicotine) at 5 cents per 1.48 ml of liquid.

* Require e-cigarette retailers to obtain a license to sell tobacco products and abide by 30+ pages of regulations governing how tobacco products are sold.

* Make it a criminal offense for consumers to buy e-cigarettes online.

-------------

**Now, some background information(why this is more terrible than it sounds.)**

RJ Reynolds (which makes Camel cigarettes, snus, dissolvables, etc. and will soon be marketing its own e-cigarette) is continuing to push for Senator Johnson's bill.  Why is **Camel Cigarettes** encouraging Oklahoma legislators to make it harder for Oklahoma e-cigarette stores to buy product?  Why is Reynolds trying to ban Internet sales?  Simple -- it will benefit Camel, and other tobacco companies, by making it harder for adult consumers to purchase premium e-cigarettes.    

On April 9, 2013, after somewhere between 250 and 300 e-cigarette users and members of the Oklahoma business community came out to Oklahoma City to protest SB 802 (a bill authored by RJ Reynolds), the House Health Committee wisely voted unfavorably on the bill.

Senator Rob Johnson is now attempting to railroad SB 802 through the Oklahoma Senate by attaching it as an amendment to an entirely unrelated bill, HB 2097.

CASAA is requesting that Oklahoma citizens come out even more strongly against FLOOR AMENDMENT #2 TO HB 2097 than they did Senator Johnson's previous bill to tax e-cigarettes, require licensing, and prohibit online sales. 

There will be no public hearing before Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 comes up for a vote, and thus we need Oklahoma citizens to immediately contact members of the entire Senate.  The most important action for Oklahoma citizens to take is to contact and speak personally with their Senator.

**Some creativity boosters:**

* Inform them you OPPOSE Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 because it would impose an unwarranted sin tax on electronic cigarette sales, hike taxes on tens of thousands of Oklahoma citizens, harm the availability of e-cigarettes by requiring Oklahoma retailers to only buy products from tobacco wholesalers, and make criminals out of thousands of Oklahoma citizens who purchase e-cigarettes online. 

* Remind the Senators that this amendment is virtually identical to SB 802, which was already soundly rejected in the House Health Committee, and that this is a cynical ploy to end-run a decision that has already been appropriately made by the Senate.

* Inform the legislators that by taxing vapor product liquid at 5 cents per 1.48 ml of liquid, you would see a TAX INCREASE if SB 802 is enacted.  In fact, a consumer buying a 30 ml bottle of e-liquid for $17 would see their tax liability raise approximately 30%!  

* Explain the vast majority of Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 is unnecessary and will have unintended consequences on Oklahoma-based small businesses and Oklahoma e-cigarette users.  Additionally, note your opposition to defining e-cigarettes to be a ""tobacco product."" 

* Note that the citizens of Oklahoma do not support new taxes and burdensome regulations. Further explain that imposing such wide-ranging laws on e-cigarette sales only serves to protect cigarette markets and will hurt small businesses in Oklahoma. 

* Explain that there is no evidence that any significant number of youth are using e-cigarettes, let alone buying them on the Internet.  A recent survey of 228 adolescents that was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health did not find a single nonsmoking youth who had even tried an e-cigarette. 

* Inform them that Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 would not only require e-cigarette sellers to obtain a license to sell tobacco, but would also mandate that the only buy their products from an Oklahoma-based distributor or wholesaler.  This provision would impact the availability of hundreds of specialty e-cigarette products, as there are no Oklahoma businesses wholesaling these products.

The fundraiser had been established for over a month, and today on the day of the event, the Camp Quest folks were told they were not welcome becuase Ok Joe's is a Christian company. I called to inquire myself and was told the same thing. I'm not advocating anybody go prank calling them or making a stink, I am however advocating you discontinue giving them your business.

Please upvote for visibility.,Archammes,87,15,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1a60la/looking_for_a_good_home_for_my_dogs_please_upvote/,"Ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, I have a conundrum.  Here as the summer comes close, I find that I am no longer going to be living in my current abode.  To that end, I will no longer be able to keep my two adorable dogs, and while that saddens me, I hope to find a home that loves and cares for them as I have.  

[Isabel](http://i.imgur.com/5AjPaxx.jpg) (fondly, Izzy or Izzabelly, she answers to both) and [Ajax](http://i.imgur.com/hTkPkeB.jpg) (the great hero!) are 1 year old (August will be 2 years) Labrador/Husky mixes, litter mates, and the best two dogs anyone could ask for.  I originally intended only to adopt Ajax (they were both rescues), but when the two were separated, the agony both exhibited was too much to take.  Since then, they have been my constant companions.  

Both dogs are fixed, and current on shots (I will renew their rabies vaccination before the summer).  They have no current health problems (though Izzybelly does have the occasional vicious fart, hence her nickname) and have been seen regularly through the Reno Animal Hospital in Midwest City.  

Ajax and Izzy are both inside dogs, though they love to play outside.  They are high energy during the day, and will give you as much love as you can possibly bear.  They are excellent around kids (my seven year old does NOT like dogs, but he loves Izzy), and they literally do everything together.  

I'm putting this out there well in advance because I want time to speak with and get to know anyone adopting my dogs.  Only someone that truly loves animals can understand the love and devotion I have to these dogs.  They were invaluable in helping me heal from my divorce, and the love they have unconditionally given me over the past year will not ever be replaced.  I am deeply saddened that I have to let them go, and I am determined to find the best possible home, period.  

I am not asking **ANY** re-homing or adoption fees.  The dogs come with their feeding bowls and their crate.  If you want to reimburse me for the crate, great, if not, as long as I know that my two loves are going to be loved and cared for, then that is enough.

**UPDATE 18 (Sunday)**  I'm sorry once again for not being able to update this for as long as I wanted to; power went out here.  There has been a confirmed number (thus far) of 5 fatalities, most of which come from Hideaway Parl/Tangere Park Area, and two children.  ~~Hundreds of~~ 20 injuries, some people are still missing.  There are multiple counties joining in the search and rescue for the people of Woodward.  The tornado sirens did not go off due to the storm approaching too quickly, along with a malfunction (lightning strike).  Police and other emergency officials have mentioned to keep calling relatives/friends there to a minimum due to it jamming their lines, so TEXTING would be the next best thing.  I know I'd probably try a few more times before giving it a break.  I hope that everyone else is okay, and if I weren't so far away, I know I'd be right there with the search and rescue teams helping them.  Donations are also being accepted, take any donations to the Living Word Fellowship Church.  They are also looking for any help they anyone can provide.  Thanks again y'all, Woodward needs all the help they can get right now.

**NEW SHELTER FOR WOODWARD:  No longer the Fairgrounds due to power outage, now going to be rerouted to the Living Word Fellowship Church**

**ALSO, THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY PUBLIC SHELTERS IN OKC OR EDMOND**

Apparently from KFOR and News9, they were saying that a tornado went through Woodward around 12:30-12:40am, and that the Tornado Sirens *DID NOT GO OFF*.  There are multiple structures destroyed, many injuries from what Gary's team was saying, and on top of that, apparently there were several after-prom parties going on.

I know this may seem stupid, but I don't know what else I can do than maybe pass this along to those who have friends or family in that area.  And sorry if this is the wrong place, I didn't know where else to post it!

Also:  Fuck the ""you are doing that too much.  try again in x minutes.""  ಠ_ಠ

*Also*: I don't care if I get downvoted for this.  Go ahead, I do not care.

1365002240.0,50,self.oklahoma,1blasr,Thanks for your help r/Oklahoma. I had a great visit!,Mitch_Deadberg,53,3,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1blasr/thanks_for_your_help_roklahoma_i_had_a_great_visit/,"A follow up from [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/19v9kb/roklahoma_i_need_your_help/)

So, it's been a few weeks since my visit, but I've been incredibly busy with work and a couple of snow storms. I thought I would come back and update you all about my trip to the state.

First of all, I want to say how amazingly nice everyone was. I thought maybe you /r/oklahoma folks were just being reddit-nice, but holy shit. Every single person we interacted with was incredibly nice.

Here was [our route through the state.](http://i.imgur.com/5FeM9Gg.png) I was happy that it gave us a good view of all parts of the state: the panhandle, SW, NW, Central and NE. Sorry, SE part of the state. I really wanted to see the World's Largest Peanut, but it was out of the way :(

It might seem droll to you guys, but seeing tumbleweeds was pretty awesome for us. We'd never seen them before, so the first one that rolled across the road had my fiancée shouting and pointing. I didn't believe her and we went an hour before we saw another. I'm not going to lie, I was super excited to finally see one. *Then*, it just got absurd. I felt like I had rolled into the ""bad part of town"" and was being attacked by tumbleweeds.  

**Incidentally, what's the road etiquette on tumbleweeds? Are you supposed to dodge them, or run over them like Tumbleweed Hitler?**

Anyway, the scenery through Southern Kansas, the Panhandle and Northern Texas was beautiful! We got some nice b-roll for the video that we're making, so keep an eye out for it when I finally post the video! 

We also really liked the wall murals in the small towns we drove through (Kingfisher, Dover, Hennessey, El Reno). I wish we could have gotten some pictures of them, but we were racing against the clock (sunset) to get to Hennessey for our picture – we didn't make it and had to take a dark picture. 

On that part of the drive, we ended up going through Clinton. We wanted to stop at the oldest operating indian store, but didn't have time. Stupid sunset.

We did get to drive along part of the Historic Route 66 through El Reno on our way to Hennessey. That was a nice experience. I wish we could have seen the statue of the Model T in Tulsa, but we were in a hurry that morning. haha, actually, it seems like we were in a hurry that whole trip...

We ended up spending the night in downtown OKC. Speaking of downtown OKC... **what's up with everything closing at 9 PM??** The only place we could find that was open was Wedge Pizzeria, and they weren't even actually open! Fortunately, they stayed late and made us an amazing pizza. If you haven't had their pizza, definitely go try it! I would definitely say it was in the top five pizzas I've ever had.

The next morning in OKC, while listening to NPR, we heard about the Indian Monument bond funding fiasco. That was super depressing and I didn't realize quite how much of a problem it was. **What's the justification for not supporting the bond?** Especially when bond APRs are at an historic low...

While we weren't able to see the OKC bombing memorial, we did end up using the Land Rush monument for our Oklahoma picture. We did, however, see the state capitol building and the ~~ridiculous~~ awesome oil derrick.

On our way out of the state, we drove over the Keystone Dam. That was a nice bit of scenery and my first time driving on a dam.

**Finally, we had a couple of questions about the state.**

1. We saw some ""squiggles"" on the road in a few places (OKC, Dover and Hennessey). I'm not sure how else to describe it... I guess it looked kind of like a [resistor symbol](http://files.ranto.webnode.com/200000042-8466e85613/resistor.png). What is that for? What does it mean?!

2. How do Indian nations work? We drove through a few nations on the way. Who does law enforcement in those areas? If I'm speeding and a police office wants to pull me over, and I drive into (or out of) a nation, can they follow me? Do the nations have true sovereignty? What else should we know about the nations?",,False,self,t5_2qtnt,False,,,True,t3_1blasr,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1blasr/thanks_for_your_help_roklahoma_i_had_a_great_visit/,

Last night I had a few friends over, and when they left they left my garage door open. I ALWAYS lock my car, but tonight I guess I thought it would be okay because I parked in the garage. Well not much longer after they left, two men in a Black/gray SUV drove past, and then turned around in the neighbors driveway to come back and steal from my car. They took my two Rockford Fosgate P1 12"" subwoofers, and a 1000 Watt amp, also they took two items of little value, but huge sentimental value to me, which would be an airsoft gun and a nerf gun that my friend gave to me before he left for the military. Please, if you find anything or you can recognize these people, let me know in comment or message. If you want one of the videos comment here and i'll probably upload it to youtube if I can.

Edit: Grammar

EDIT 2: To anyone who is waiting for me to post the video, I'm going up to the police station today, and I'm going to make sure I'm not doing anything to possibly get myself in trouble for posting about a pending investigation. I'll get back to you all later with what I can do.

Looks like this is shaping up to get pretty bad, though surprisingly it seems the local TV stations are downplaying it, somewhat.


Pass along to everyone as needed.


Good morning.

We're still very concerned about the severe weather potential today and especially tomorrow. I'll provide a more detailed weather update later this morning, but I wanted to share a few key points and notes to help us all be ready...

- It is very unusual for the Storm Prediction Center to issue a High
Risk outlook for the day two (tomorrow) period, and you can see the area they're most concerned about here
&lt;http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day2otlk.html&gt; . But as we always say, the storms have no idea where we draw those lines, and the outlook categories are not fences that keep the bad storms only in the moderate or high risk areas. If you are in a risk area today or tomorrow - slight, moderate or high - you need to pay close attention and check the weather often!

- We are concerned about the potential for dangerous storms tomorrow affecting large numbers of people who aren't in their normal home or work locations. The Red-White game at OU in the afternoon and the Southwest Street Rod Nationals in OKC are just two examples of large gatherings of people who will be very vulnerable to severe weather. Be sure event organizers in your jurisdiction know about the severe weather threat and that they think about their plan to receive warnings and to keep people safe.

- The exact timing of storms is still in question. Unlike last May 24th
when storms fired before 3pm, tomorrow's storms may not form until very late in the day, and we could see a continuing tornado threat after dark. In addition, storms may be fast-moving, making storm spotting operations very difficult and more dangerous than usual.

- We will be providing lots of safety and preparedness information on
our Facebook &lt;http://www.facebook.com/US.NationalWeatherService.Norman.gov&gt;  and Twitter &lt;https://twitter.com/#%21/nwsnorman&gt;  pages and you should feel free to share anything we post through your own social media accounts, email, etc.

I've attached a document we've shared on Facebook that outlines some general tornado safety tips to help people get prepared. Our goal is to get people to do what they need to do to be ready today so it'll be easier to be safe tomorrow.

I'll be in touch through the day, but keep an eye on our web page
&lt;http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/&gt;  for the latest information

**EDIT:** Some additional info my wife got from former OKC TV meteorologist Aaron Tuttle who now works for the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar group at the FAA

URGENT UPDATE: I just finished looking over the morning computer models and things have gone from bad to worse. The trend continues to show grave concern. We are in store for a 2 day outbreak of deadly tornadoes beginning this afternoon. There is a High Risk from the SPC tomorrow but there should be one today as well, if at least not a Moderate. Doesn't matter, don't let that affect you either way.... The point is we have two unique atmospheric conditions setting up which will give us the same result each day. Storms should start to fire by 4pm across W/SW/S/C OK and continue to develop during the overnight. The tornado threat increases exponentially after dark, but that's not to say there won't be short lived quick ones before dusk. I do expect them. The long track long lived ones may hold off until after dusk when we are all most vulnerable. The storms will continue through much of the night over the state before ending by day break. The next round for Saturday still appears to hold off until late in the day, near dusk for another evening event. As the 1st round will work over the atmosphere to help stabilize it. This is the kind of situation where unfortunately people die. There's only so much you can do to take responsibility for yourself and loved ones. For one, find a sturdy shelter, two get a NOAA weather radio and pay attention, and three pray. I have a very bad feeling about this. I hope I am wrong though. Too many things are pointing to one of the nastiest events we've seen over this region in a long time. Also, OK is not alone in this. N TX up to NE and points East will be affected also. This will be a storm system for the record books folks. I don't often get worked up over events until I see a setup that looks to take lives from strong tornadoes such as EF4s and EF5s, especially at night. This is one of those. Don't panic, just prepare.

The First Assembly of God and the Baptist Church, along with the local fire department organized it. I pulled into the parking lot of the AoG church around 6:30am. By 6:50, I was thinking ""Man, where is everybody."" Just before seven, I see a bus pull on to Maple Rd and come toward the church, behind it was a long, I mean a loooong, line of cars. It was amazing, just car after car loaded with people and supplies. By 8:00 they had teams going out to, I believe I heard, 24 different sites. And even had a few going out to Prague and Wellston. I was speechless.  From a few of the people I talked to, there were people who came in from Texas, Indiana, and Colorado to help. To give you an idea of how many people were estimated to have shown up. The town of Carney has roughly 640 people, the town doubled in size today with all the volunteers. Once I got my guys on a team and headed to their site, I went over to the MARC (Multiple Agency Resource Center) to man my organization's booth to provide aid. Again, a very heart warming experience actually talking and helping those that were affected.

It was just amazing. The people of Carney are very thankful for those who came out. It was also amazing to see how much and how quick the community of Carney banded together after the storm Sunday evening. 

So as one Volunteer to another... Thank you!",,False,self,t5_2qtnt,False,,,True,t3_1f2g52,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1f2g52/carney_a_comment_from_the_perspective_of_a/,

I hope that the project will eventually turn into a museum, but for now I'm starting it by taking a few items from my personal collection to local schools so that students can see the real thing instead of having to look in a textbook.

I've already given four presentations in two botany classes at the high school I graduated from and they went well. I brought several live plants that many of the students had never seen before.

I have other projects in mind that I can do with the organization, like making molds of a big fossil surface at Fort Gibson lake before it erodes away forever and a series of YouTube videos and documentaries that are interesting, educational, entertaining and can be used in classrooms.

**EDIT: added the mission statement/plan for everyone to read.**

&gt;**Preface**
&gt;    The major defining characteristic of humans is intelligence. We are, as far as we can tell, the most intelligent and capable species here on Earth, but we have a problem; Too few of us know enough about the world to be able to make educated decisions about our current and future pursuits towards resolving these problems and many us do not appreciate the world around us to care about it.

&gt;    Our future survival on this planet and in the universe depends on our ability to solve problems and care for our environment. It is then our most important goal to educate ourselves so that we understand and appreciate the world around us so that we can properly respond to our problems.

&gt;**The mission**
&gt;   The organization is a non-profit, educational resource aimed at increasing the general public's interest, appreciation, access and understanding of science, history, culture and the world around them in general While promoting critical thinking and intellectual development. We believe that the root of many problems that we as a species currently face are driven by a lack of education, appreciation and understanding of the world around us.

&gt;   As a global resource we will act as a compendium of human knowledge and experience to provide for the betterment of humanity through education and as a local resource we will act to use our knowledge and experience to serve the community and assist in whatever capacity we may be desired or needed.

&gt;As an educational resource in both a physical and digital form, we will:

&gt;   * Provide an educational resource to the local and global community.

&gt;   * Provide a location for students and those that seek knowledge to study and learn on their own time or after school or work.

&gt;   * Conduct efforts to locate, store and preserve various items of scientific, biological, historical, cultural or educational value.

&gt;   * Create and present programs of educational value in an entertaining way both in person and through physical and digital media.

&gt;   * Assist local schools in education through the presentation of collection items in classrooms and through arranged field trips and presentations.


&gt;**The Plan**
Our organization will begin as a simple program to bring hands-on learning to local schools and to create video presentations for the internet. We will provide our services free to the schools and will gain funding with sales of DVDs of our educational productions, merchandise and donations.

&gt;Once the collections and funds of the organization grow to a sufficient level, a permanent physical location will be acquired. A collection space for the housing of the collection and A studio for the creation of educational videos will be constructed.

&gt;Our physical facilities will be examples of environmentally-friendly construction and practices and will be constructed to be as self-sufficient as possible through the use of solar power, natural lighting, recycling and other techniques. The overall construction of the facilities will reflect the local culture and will be built to withstand the local environmental hazards (Tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, etc...).

&gt;Once the collection and funds have again reached a sufficient level, the facility will be expanded to provide a small display area for public viewing of the collection. Display space will then be added as needed when funds allow.*


**I'd like to do all of this here in Oklahoma, but I've never started a non-profit or owned a business. I'm pretty sure I'll need a lawyer to help me do this correctly and legally. Does anybody else have any experience in non-profit organizations or know of a good law firm that could help with setting up the non-profit organization?**",,False,self,t5_2qtnt,1368638981.0,,,True,t3_1ebl1t,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1ebl1t/i_want_to_start_an_educational_nonprofit/,

Please, call their offices, send them emails from multiple accounts, and ask for them to meet with their constituents before they vote on cloture for this bill. Explain your opposition. Tell them why it will affect Oklahoma negatively.

Not to mention, that darn Inhofe voted for the NDAA, which allows indefinite military detention of US citizens without trial.

Call them, speak your mind. Talk with the aides as long as possible so they know how important this is. Read text of the bills. Tell them all of your concerns. Let them know it will affect your daily life, as well as other Oklahomans' lives, and it will negatively affect Oklahoman business. Demand that they meet with their constituents before voting on this important bill, and demand that they vote against cloture for these bills.

My goal is to find something that I can take a picture of that epitomizes ""Oklahoma""-ness. 

Large things – such as fields, large buildings, geological features, or things on the ground – are very difficult to get a usable picture of. 

For past portions of this project, I've photographed a lighthouse, statues, building signs, monuments, skylines, etc. The idea is to find things that are either historic or easily identifiable. 

We're currently scheduled to drive through Hennessey, Stillwater and Tulsa, but those are all obviously close to OKC. We're not opposed to adding a new city if there's something you guys can suggest.

So, can any of you help? 

**Edit**: Wow! Thanks so much for the great suggestions and ideas. We've got a few things to consider, and some time to think about it. We'll be in the area Sunday/Monday, so no rush on a decision yet. If anyone has any other great suggestions, pass 'em along!

I'll do a followup post to let y'all know what we decided on.

They started school on Aug 1st and due to construction she has been forced to teach out of the library.  There is nowhere to hang things on the walls, no desks for the kids to sit at, people constantly coming and going, etc...  She did have a SmartBoard but they just took that to go install it in a classroom.

She could use just about anything, but specifically over-sized pillows, floor puzzles, lincoln logs, legos are he main things.  There is also nowhere for large whiteboard, so some mini whiteboards are also something she is looking.

We have no idea how much longer it will be until she is able to return to a classroom, and even then having desks might still be an issue.  I got her signed up to receive a ""teacher gift"" through the reddit gift exchange that is going on right now.  I will paste her own words below.  Thanks everyone!

---
I teach in an inner-city extremely high poverty area in Oklahoma City.  My kids are absolutely amazing, and I wish that I had an endless supply of money to give them everything they should have in their lives.  

My schedule this year is so difficult for kindergarten.  We have our breaks in the morning, and then we are stuck in the classroom from 11:25-3:10 every day.  We can't have recess because our school is under construction, and they have demolished the playground.  These poor kids do such an amazing job of focusing the best they can, but it's SO HARD when they're only 5 years old!!  I would love anything that you are willing to give to my kids (none of this is for me, I swear!!) but more than anything, I would love legos, tinker toys, lincoln logs, floor puzzles, Play-Doh, and anything else that they could do at their seats to give them a little bit of a break in the afternoons.  Anything that doesn't require them to sit still, that will allow them to just get some of their talking out and be doing something that isn't school work!!

I also would love actual supplies, I created a wish list on Amazon, I don't expect anything from there, I was dreaming when I created it LOL!!

The other thing I can never get enough of is reward type things.  Simple things such as decorative pencils, stickers, dollar tree toys - these kids don't require much in order to be on Cloud 9!!

Thank you so much, anything and everything is SO appreciated :)

Neither are neutered or have their shots, but both are fit as fiddles and need to be adopted by June. NEITHER HAVE EVER BEEN STRAY.

He can no longer stand and is now incontinent. He needs to be somewhere like a nursing home that he can be properly cared for, but (by the way) insurance does not cover nursing home expenses. =( The initial fee is $4200 and $149/day after that! We need to sell his RV so we can afford good care for him. Anyone interested?

It's a 2000 Riata made by the now-bought-out Harney Coach Works. It only has 50k miles on it, and there are lots of pictures and details on the website below. It's being sold on consignment through a dealer, but after a month we haven't had a single person even look at it. =( The RV is in Oklahoma, but we may be able to arrange to drive it to you if you want to buy it and live elsewhere but fairly nearby.

We also have a tow hitch available if needed and the modified Dodge Durango the other half is installed in (it's a drive-shaft disconnect kind of hitch) if interested.

The RV is being sold WAY below the MSRP. This thing is like-new, and he bought it for $100k and hardly used it. It's for sale for just over $34k because we really need it to sell so we can get him into some proper healthcare ASAP. =( If you wish to verify any of this, you can call the dealership at the number listed on their website. Thanks guys. We really need to be rid of this thing. It would pay for his care, and get rid of a good chunk of his bills (he's still having to pay it off and pay for insurance on it until it sells too...).

Please view these and write your local Congressman.

----

[HB1354](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1354): Would allow bars/restaurants/etc to advertise happy hours between 4pm &amp; 7pm and allow them to sell alcohol at a discounted price.

[HB1741](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1741): This is a shell bill called the ""Oklahoma Intoxicating Liquors Reform Act"". I will update the description as soon as more info is posted.

[HB1757](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1757): Would require breweries to print the exact ABV on the label.

[HB1841](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1841): Same as HB1741 but called the ""Intoxicating Liquors Act"".

[HB1963](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1963): A very expansive bill and I'm not 100% what the goal is. It appears to be removing references to ""low-point beer"" and allowing all beer to be classified the same.

[HB2104](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB2104): Same as HB1741 but called the ""Intoxicating Liquors Policy Act"".

[HJR1011](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1011) &amp; [HJR1014](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1014): Would allow breweries to sell their beer outside of the wholesalers network (I would assume this would allow brewpubs to serve their own high-point beer). Also would allow breweries to sell their own product at the brewery. This would be a ballot initiative.

[HJR1015](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1015): Would allow liquor stores to sell ""nonalcoholic beverages designed to be mixed with alcoholic beverages, bottle openers, cork screws and other wine and spirit accessories."" This would be a ballot initiative. *(2/23/11: Passed committee.)*

[HJR1034](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1034): Would allow supermarkets and other grocery/retail stores to sell beer and wine between .5% and 25% ABV. This would be a ballot initiative.

[HJR1041](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1041): Would allow wineries to directly ship their product to consumers over the age of 21. This would be a ballot initiative.

[SB861](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB861): Would allow bars/restaurants/etc to advertise happy hours between 3pm &amp; 7pm and allow them to sell alcohol at a discounted price.

[SJR35](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SJR35): Has something to do with liquor, but the link to the actual text of the bill is broken.

Currently (and this has been on the books since at least 1986 i believe) it is not permissible to open a new liquor store or bar (bar meaning 50%+ of your sales is from spirits/wine/stong point beer) within 300 feet of an existing church or school.  School includes elementary, junior high, high school, colleges and universities. 

That seems reasonable, keep kids and the religiously inclined away from a decidedly adult establishment.  But a few years ago UCO purchased space in a few buildings downtown to host its American College of Music, (i think thats right)  and in doing so set a 300 ft perimeter wherein no new bars or liquor stores may be built.  

Some people have heralded this as a major hindrance to the development of business in the Bricktown entertainment district.  This only refers to new establishments, old ones are grandfathered in.  If a bar owner sells the bar to a new owner, the new owner has I believe 60 days to renew the licensing of the establishment and the grandfather will still be in effect.

There has been legislation set forth that has some interesting language in it.  In the proposed legislation, colleges and universities which occupy ""business enhancement"" districts in cities of 300,000 population or more may OPT IN to allow this rule to be waived.

UCO does not want to cause problems for business in Bricktown, and they are supporting the legislation.  But it has been submitted this session, towards the end, and didn't really have the language needed to convince lawmakers it was a good idea.  So this new form will be voted on probably near the beginning of next session in February or so.

I work with liquor law in OK and I am also a supporter of the responsible consumption of alcohol.

I think many people in the enforcement areas of Oklahoma liquor legislation would say that in order for Oklahoma's laws to change, there would need to be a considerable upswell of support for reform legislation.  

Federal government seems so far away and bleak.  but you have a very real opportunity to affect your local lawmakers and government.   ",,False,self,t5_2qtnt,False,,,True,t3_j866l,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/j866l/bricktown_liquor_laws_and_you/,

Practically everything has.""",bansley,28,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/f0ng0/anything_can_have_happened_in_oklahoma/,"Despite it's reputation for bible-thumping and right-winging, I truly love Oklahoma. Rather, I love Oklahoma's history. I think there is something very alluring and romantic about the Great Plains and Tallgrass Prairie, something heart wrenching and thrilling about the tales of Cowboys and Indians, something inspiring and brilliant about a city that was built in a day and a state that is prospering despite its many setbacks. 

I have the pleasure of working in a shop that carries Oklahoma-based books. This one in particular, [Oklahoma: A Portrait of America](http://www.amazon.com/Oklahoma-Portrait-America-Libby-Bender/dp/0980021405), has some outstanding quotes that eloquently articulates our land's rich history: 

""Oklahoma is a tallgrass prairie and everlasting mountains. It is secret patches of ancient earth tromped smooth and hard by generations of dancing feet. It is calloused hands. It is the aroma of rich crude oil fused with the scent of sweat and sacred smoke. It is a stampede, a pie supper, a revival. It is a wildcat gusher coming in. It is a million dollar deal cemented with a handshake.""

""Okie. A slur that comes whispering out of a dusty ghost wind. Spit out like a hairball, aimed at people with the resiliency to survive some of the worst times this country has ever seen. The people of Oklahoma came out of the dust bowl. They came with everything they owned thrown into a wagon, a car, a suitcase. They came because they believed in themselves and their ability to make it in a place where anything and everything is possible. They stayed because it is.""

""Oklahoma - Red people, red land, red rivers cutting a lifeline through desert and deep forest. A place where outlaws and misfits came when there was no where else to go. Where Indians roamed and others came ushered under an armed escort. Where pioneers raced for an acre of chance. Oklahoma is a place where will and wile are still the difference between success and failure. A place wild and open and free.""

So, while modern day Oklahoma and I may have our differences, I will always have respect for the people and events that made this land what it is today. Here's hoping to put a nice break in the otherwise depressing posts of r/Oklahoma. :) ",,False,self,t5_2qtnt,False,,,True,t3_f0ng0,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/f0ng0/anything_can_have_happened_in_oklahoma/,

Yesterday morning, I awoke to him vomiting and having diarrhea. I was alarmed, but I waited to see if it just ran its course, thinking he may have ate something weird (he's a chewer and he gets into stuff that I didn't even know was within his reach). Last night, I realized he didn't jump all over me and go crazy when I came out of my room that morning, or when I got home from classes. He was slightly lethargic and a lot more calm than usual. Still with the vomiting and diarrhea. I became more concerned and gave him some Gatorade to keep him hydrated and tried to get him to eat whatever I could. He hasn't touched his food or water. He ate a few tortilla chips and some vienna sausages. I was going to take him to the vet Monday morning.
Today, it hadn't stopped, and the diarrhea looked strange, so I called the animal emergency hospital and told them his symptoms. As soon as they said ""parvo"" I freaked out and went down my list of people to call to ask for help, I had to call the last person I EVER ask to help with anything (my shitty, condescending cunt of an aunt) and she said to take him and she'd pay for the exam ($69) and to see how much the parvo test and stuff would be.

What ended up happening was she heard ""worms"" and thought well let's test for that first because it's treatable, cause hey why test for something that's just gonna kill him anyway RIGHT? RIGHT? So my dad ended up paying (because he didn't want her hanging it over my head) the SAME amount he would have for a parvo test on a fecal test for worms, which came back negative. I couldn't ask for anymore money from anyone.

The vet nurse basically said if I can come up with the $43~ before his shift ends around midnight CST that he will waive another exam cost.

He has said he is pretty sure it's parvo, just by looking at him and hearing the symptoms and seeing his poop and smelling it. He said if I had come in and money wasn't a factor his initial reaction would be to immediately hospitalize and get him on IV fluids and run a Parvo workup.
Of course, that still leaves me with the treatment costs if he DOES have parvo, but what's killing me right now is not knowing whether or not he has it, and feeling like I'm basically sitting here trying to make him comfortable and seeing if he dies. 
He has a fever of 103.5, his gums are white, his diarrhea now has little bits of blood in it, and he's somewhat lethargic. He's up under my chair asleep. The tech told me to keep him warm and freeze some Pedialyte into ice cubes, but I can't even afford fucking Pedialyte right now. 

I'm at my fucking wits end and all I want to do is cry.


If there is ANYWAY ANYONE can help me, I would appreciate it so much, and would love you forever and do whatever I can to pay it forward. This shit always happens to me, and I always help everyone I can even if it ends up being detrimental to myself. I just always get the short end of the stick :(





**EDIT:** I had him put to sleep tonight. He wasn't keeping anything down and was shitting pure blood. He was listless and was starting to wheez. 
He went to sleep in my arms.

I am going to raise money to give to the cancer research center in Norman, but I also want to help a family. maybe the bills are piling up, maybe the family in question wants to take a vacation, or a staycation, or something.

I went to Iceland for 6 months earlier this year and there I met a girl from Tulsa who was studying in Iceland as an exchange student from OSU. We fell in love and after some thinking I decided to move to Oklahoma while she's finishing her studies at the university. I also decided to get my university studies going while living there (I've been accepted at Northern Oklahoma College).

Now what I'm asking you is: What can expect? I've been googling Oklahoma and to be honest there's mostly negative stuff about the state. I'm not too interested in this. I want to know what's great about Oklahoma! So could you guys and girls fill me in? Tell me everything there is to know about Oklahoma that could be interesting for someone like me :)

Katy's mom was being whispered about, and even though we were young, we knew something bad had happened. She worked downtown. She hadn't called.
It was just she and I standing outside with our teacher by the time school closed. We sat there, not saying anything, katy hugging her knees.   The moment Katy's mom drove into the parking lot, jumped out and hugged her daughter was the most moving thing I have ever seen, will ever see.

Thank you all so much for the support, ideas, feedback, and especially those select few that were ready to mobilize locally to help an anonymous person. Proving once again Reddit as an amazing community.**

*Update 6/5/13 9:32AMPSD. Just as a follow up, I just got more of the story. Because of all our efforts, my cousin finally started asking some important questions to the facebook woman last night. The woman refused to skype, chat, etc. and ""got annoyed with being questioned and immediately defriended her."" Dodged a bullet on this one I'd say... unfortunately we have no way of warning others. Stay safe Oklahoma.*

Reddit, long time lurker here, and I need your help. **I believe my cousin is in great danger**. She wants to visit an online friend, that she has never met, in Claremore, OK and I'm getting TONS of red flags. But I cannot stop her from going. **Is there a kind soul that I can trust to perhaps go with her to meet this person?** – otherwise I need to buy a plane ticket pronto.

Background: Two of my cousins (aunt with niece) are visiting America from Bavaria, both very sweet girls in their 20's, that speak little English and come from a very small town in Germany. Aunt is older and a little more experienced, the other is her niece in her early 20's and has been very sheltered. They arrived in the East Coast, and are currently with family in Virginia. I live in California, and they're working their way West to visit us in ~2 weeks.

Issue: The younger of the two has a plane ticket to break away from her Aunt and visit a ""friend"" of hers in OK later this week. Alone. We all thought it was an exchange student or someone she knew. But no, it's a ""friend from farmville"" that she has never ever met.

Red Flags: The ""friend"" is on facebook, and looks to be a ~20yo girl. They ""talk all the time"" and are ""good friends on facebook"". But knowing the online world, and how young and trusting my cousin is, I was nervous. So I paid for a background check on her name. First off, her photo is from high school, but **she is in her 50s.** That was enough for our family to ask her not to go, but she assures us ""everything will be ok"". I'm not so sure...

I've been researching as much as I can, some of the information may not be correct... But I've found **8 alias names** and **26 listed addresses** with her current address being next to a truck stop. Bankruptcy, possible ex-husbands with numerous aliases, etc. Do I have a right to be scared? 

I also checked on her current husband, and he is currently on probation for child endangerment, with a previous arrest for omitting to provide for a child. All of this is too risky for me, but my cousin is young &amp; naive and convinced her friend is just a nice person online. Maybe she is right... I know this is a shot in the dark, and I really hope this is all just me being paranoid... but I'd feel a million times safer if a nice soul in the Tulsa area could perhaps accompany her. Again, this is not a witch hunt, I am not going to give out any personal details of those involved, please PM me if you are someone that could help. Thank you Reddit.

**tl;dr: My naive ~20yo cousin from Germany wants to visit a ~50yo facebook friend she's never met, alone, with many red flags and I cannot stop her. Anyone in the Tulsa area that can help?**

Mods: To the best of my ability I believe I am within guidelines. Please advise if not. Throwaway to keep everything anonymous for those involved. I will verify with mods via pm if necessary. 

**UPDATE 060413.1156PST** I have her flight information. She is going tomorrow, landing around 9pm in Tulsa. We have told her to take a picture with the woman meeting her as soon as she lands. She realizes the woman is not her age, but ""has daughters her age"" (which don't seem to have facebooks...?). We have a cop friend looking into the situation. As she is willing to go home with this woman, I don't think someone going as an intercept will help much as I'm sure nothing will happen at the airport but rather after they leave... ughh",,False,self,t5_2qtnt,1370450145.0,,,True,t3_1flxwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1flxwy/i_fear_my_german_cousin_is_in_great_danger_to/,

Normally, I'd write this off as aircraft or  whatnot but I also witnessed other aircraft flying nearby this object and it seemed 10x brighter than the aircraft in the sky. I followed this object home until I hit Watonga, where it fell into the horizon. Did anyone else notice a really bright light in the sky around this time tonight? 

Edit1: Really, down-votes already because I saw something in the sky I cannot immediately identify? I checked the lat/long of the night sky when I got home and the only bright star on the sky at that time could have been Betelgeuse. All I want is confirmation this is what I could have seen. 

Edit2 12/16: The down votes started early and I bitched but you positive Ok. redditors ultimately prevailed. Thank you. I know you saw something too. I've seen this object in the sky 3 nights in a row and nobody reported back since. I also tonight have seen a 2nd object bright in the sky more like a south west position from 6AM to 6:15. This particular object could have been a satellite because it disappeared in the sky in a matter of minutes. 

I've also seen a some sort of weird extreme source of light flashing in the entire sky around Cashion around 6:15PM pm to 7:00 that wasn't a tv/radio transmission tower light or anything I could image around that could possibly be man-made. It looks like low-level storm lightning flashes from the ground-up to the sky but I cannot fathom what could output that kind of lumen intensity across then entire skyline unless some farmer or his kid are trolling somehow. There's some serious weird-ass shit going in the sky on my way home at night lately. I've done this for 2 years without a peep but after what I've seen recently, I have to say something now.

I was recently browsing NORML's website and noticed that the Tulsa chapter is significantly more active than the OKC chapter, so I emailed the the current chapter holder and this is the response I received. 

""The OKC chapter has pretty much degraded to just ""me"". I have been involved since 1990. We used to have a working chapter but it absolutely didn't accomplish anything. It was basically the founder, Michael Pearson and I spending our time effort and money on trying to get people to help by educating friends and family. But ask any of them to actually go to the Capitol to help!! Forget it!
We used to have a yearly 4/20 event at the Capitol. The next to the last 4/20 event we had over 400 people go to the Capitol grounds. The whole premise of the event that day was lobbying your state legislators. About 14 people actually went inside the Capitol. The interview on the news that day was of a pink haired person who was stoned or drunk ( a really great example!! NOT) of the people's message. The last 4/20 event at the Capitol it was a rainy day and not too many showed up. The bands couldn't even set up because of the moisture. We called the day early and went home. The kids who showed up stayed behind and chalked the Capitol grounds!! We were told that we were no longer welcome to have events there. But more importantly I had lost my will to try to direct these people. From there on out I just decided I would do what I can do myself and not try to get others to work on issues because it seemed fruitless. Nine years ago I had a major event happen in my life...my husband passed away. He was my support. I have since gone to work and haven't got as much time as I would like to be able to further the cause.
I still answer the phone calls and help people find a good attorney. I still help by going to court with people and holding their hands. We do have a Facebook account and this last session we had a Medical Marijuana bill. We were able to generate over 500 calls to Legislators. The bill did not get a hearing in committee but is still alive for next year.
2 years ago I worked with my county Democratic Party to get Medical Marijuana into the State Democratic platform. It is still there even though you don't hear candidates talk about it much.
 
I will retire soon (13 more months!) and will be able to start actively lobbying again. In the mean time if you would like to start a chapter in your area I would love to help you start it up. I have tried twice in the Norman area but it seems the only thing these people came to the meetings for was to hopefully smoke some pot. After letting people know that wasn't the point of holding meetings they don't come back.
 
If you have a plan and would like my support give me a call and we will get to work.""

This was from Norma Sapp, I believe us as redditors/ENTS have a prime opportunity here to make a change and set a good foundation for the future of cannabis in Oklahoma.

So, Who's in?
