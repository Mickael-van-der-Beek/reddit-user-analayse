1342723832.0,300,self.Jazz,wtwws,Can we stop posting the AT40 of jazz?,IAmRobertFlood,359,59,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/wtwws/can_we_stop_posting_the_at40_of_jazz/,"Currently on the front page there are 13 YouTube links, and 6 of those link to a song that I think are canon listening for jazz fans. The top post right now is All Blues from Kind of Blue, followed closely by On the Sunny Side of the Street, Caravan, and Saint Louis Blues. Really? This is like going into /r/classicalmusic and posting Beethoven's 5th Symphony, or going into /r/AdviceAnimals and posting the ORLY Owl. There are articles in the sidebar for essential albums - Let's try to introduce a little bit more diversity into this subreddit. There are a million albums out there and thousands of modern artists making incredible music that I think everyone here can enjoy. Sure Miles and Trane and Bird were great, I don't think there was ever any debate over that, but personally I see posting another recording of Oleo or a Coltrane ballad (Who doesn't know that he played ballads as well as anybody?) as blatant karma whoring, and contributing nothing to the quality of this community. I think there's a time and a place for posting recordings like this (i.e. ""Just transcribed this classic solo - take a closer listen to what he's doing at 03:12!"", etc.), but /r/metal has a blacklist on posting classic recordings for good reason, and I think it's time we introduce our own. This is a self-post, I don't get Karma for it - please upvote so we can get a discussion going on this topic. Thanks guys.

Edit: Thanks for all of your responses guys, I think everyone has made valid points, I really appreciate the discussion this brought up. My suggestion is that we create a classics/new-to-jazz megathread every week where we post stuff like Kind of Blue and the Basie Band. Does anyone else support this idea, and have new submissions reserved for lesser-known recordings (by classic artists, or modern artists), interesting articles, and pictures? Thanks again everyone. My apologies if I sounded like ""that guy"" or a jazz-douche, I just think a wider diversity would do our community some good. I also think just because you're new to jazz, doesn't mean you can't appreciate things other than the classics. Chris Potter does some awesome shit that's not anything like a standard, and Robert Glasper is super hip, etc.

We could pick an album every week. Options could vary among the well-known classics, the more experimental, and some brand new jazz CDs. Ideally we would pick albums that are legally available on programs like Spotify.

There's so much jazz music out there, and something like this would help all of us broaden our horizons and introduce us to music that we otherwise might not give a chance.

I would be willing to get the ball rolling if there's enough of a response to this post.

---

**Edit**:
*Logistics*: We still need to figure out how to pick these from week-to-week. /r/hiphopheads does this and they say

&gt; People who participate in the discussion in a meaningful way are entered into a draw to select next week's album

So maybe the user who posted one of the top 5 or so comments from the previous week's post would be picked at random (or by the previous week's chooser?), and then that user would decide what album is next. I think that would work well, since it would avoid the clutter and hassle of having separate posts for nominations then polls.

I was also thinking of making a Google spreadsheet of all the albums so that we can keep track of what we talked about and to make sure to mix things up (old and new, traditional and experimental, etc).

**Edit**:
Thanks to Factran and the mods for putting this up on the sidebar and highlighting it on /r/jazz.

Also, I'm really excited for this and am willing to be the one who steers this along for at least the next several months or so. Listen to the albums, discuss, and enjoy. This should be lots of fun, ya dig

I’ve made a simple piano backing track of Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” and would love to hear your solos! Share your talent",WRavalJazz,157,18,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/12z2y7/rjazz_experiment_calling_all_rjazz_saxophonists/,"Hi everyone, for those of you who don’t know me by now, my name is Winston aka [WRAVALJAZZ](http://www.youtube.com/wravaljazz). I’ve been playing piano for over 50 years, but stumbled on r/jazz maybe last year. 

My goal here is to share my **love** for jazz improvisation and to get others involved and **share** their talents with those of us watching around the globe.  

For the longest time I’ve wanted to “jam” with musicians using the Internet. I’m probably one of the older players on this sub-reddit, but I’m still trying to push the power of the Internet and its ability to share music through this medium for my generation. 

Despite this r/jazz of having over 20,000 subscribers, I’ve been a bit disappointed by the lack of original content shared here. I have a pretty long attention span, and I want to hear everyone’s original compositions! 

I encourage those of you who play to come out of your shell and show us what you’ve got! Your contributions only enhance the quality of this subreddit when students and professionals alike can share their passion for music and for jazz instantaneously. 

**** **Don't be afraid to record yourself! Share with us your versions on soundcloud or youtube**

**REQUEST**: Downvotes are okay! It’s better than NO FEEDBACK, but please if you have something to say, please say it! **I too would like to improve and progress.** 

Here are some examples from jam sessions:

[Name that tune Series ep. 1]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3YIv9yBu80)

[Invitation Piano Solo - Solo at 00:38]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93mTYcLQi2o)

Poncho Sanchez’ arrangement on YouTube: [Live – “Watermelon Man”]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oenlU0KiILc)
________________

**You can download “Watermelon Man” from my soundcloud using the following link:** [WRavalJazz Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/wravaljazz/play-along-series-ep-1)

The file format is in .aiff. 



**Here is the song in video format, for those of you who just want to watch:**

[Watermelon Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JutE4WlBR0A)

Here are simple sheet music examples in F: 

[Watermelon Man Lead Sheet]( http://i.imgur.com/DqJbG.jpg)

[Watermelon Man – Bass]( http://i.imgur.com/VLPnU.jpg)

~~Saxophonists, bass players, percussionists,~~ 

**All instruments, let’s hear what you’ve got! It’s a great way to practice and share your talent!**

If this experiment takes off, pm me for more songs to choose from, I would like to do some *really* challenging songs! Thanks everyone!

-Winston

**UPDATE #1**: I'm glad that there are responses to this post! Let's get this thing going everyone! Also, after we get a couple of submissions in, **let's get some ideas** for the next tune. I don't mind recording on my free time tomorrow morning or tonight. Beginner to Advanced players drop a suggestion for a tune and I'll play it, also Latin and Funk, whatever you guys want

**UPDATE #2**: Improv from 00:44 to 01:54

1366659458.0,128,self.Jazz,1cvsg5,Ideas for improving this subreddit,billymcgee,142,14,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/1cvsg5/ideas_for_improving_this_subreddit/,"Hey r/jazz!  I'm rapidly becoming a bigger fan of jazz due to a number of influences, from spending more time reading about it to seeing more of it performed live (my school has an incredible jazz studio).  That being said, there's not always a whole lot that really jumps out at me on this subreddit.  There's a couple of issues with this subreddit I think we as a community could work on here, and here are some ideas I came up with for how we could go about doing that.    
    
1:  We get at least one topic every few days along the lines of 'Hey, I'm new to jazz, what should I listen to?' and the answers are usually 'Check the sidebar' or an abbreviated list of greats.  I think that shows that this subreddit isn't super accessible to jazz newbies, and we could do more to help them.  My suggestion is to create a comprehensive list by decade with brief descriptions to give new people not only something to listen to but context on what it is and why it's important.  I think a community-made playlist would be helpful as well for everyone, not just new folks.    
    
2:  Along those lines, I think a glossary of terms explained in plain English would be helpful as well.  I think a lot of people don't really know the difference between third stream jazz and cool jazz, or what free jazz is or what ECM-style jazz is, etc.  It might be helpful to include in that a list of frequently-posted artists (from jazz greats like Miles and Coltrane to crossover hits like BADBADNOTGOOD and the Seatbelts) that explain what style of jazz they are and what else sounds like them.    
    
3:  Occasionally this subreddit will go through a 'phase' where one certain subgenre is really popular for a day or two.  I think we should celebrate those phases and perhaps do like they do in r/hiphopheads and have certain days of the week where posting a certain subgenre is encourage.  I think it's important that we not DISCOURAGE anything else on those days, but for example, if we had Trio Thursdays, we could take each Thursday to post great examples of music performed by jazz trios.  We could have like, Free Jazz Fridays or Big Band Sundays or Funky Mondays or whatever.  Suggestions are welcome and encouraged.  
    
4:  I think one of the best things we can do for this subreddit is foster more discussion.  Right now, and regularly, the front page is a ton of links with one or two discussions that never take off an awful lot.  I think the Listening Club would be a good avenue for discussions if more people used it (and I'm guilty of not using it as much as I could be as well), but I also think there are a TON of good discussion ideas for jazz as a genre that we could talk about.  Here are some examples.    
If you could see any combination of performers play together, who would you see?    
What stage of ________'s career was the best/most important?  When do you think they started to change their style, and why?    
What are some of your favorite solos, and why?    
Who played (name of standard) the best?    
What were some 'failed experiments' of jazz greats?  Why don't you think they worked?  Do you think they're underrated?    
Etc., etc., etc.    
    
5:  It's a small thing, but I think we could spice up the header/sidebar here.  I can't do that myself or know anyone personally who could, but I think it would make this subreddit more memorable    
    
Edit: 6:  I think we should have a stricter policy on image posts.  We get a lot of pictures that are just a jazz guy doing jazz things that don't inspire much discussion beyond 'lol the look on his face'.  I'm not saying we should forbid picture posts altogether, but only if they're going to provoke a real discussion.  For example, 'help me identify the person in this picture' or 'the album art for ______'s new album has been revealed', or 'this is what _______ wrote about ________'.

**I know this list is very incomplete. My intention was to provide a sampler of the various flavors of jazz bass to the interested beginner. Feel free to add suggestions in the comments!**


**INTRODUCTION**
The history of jazz bass is one of liberation. The acoustic bass is a beast of an instrument: it's hard to make it sound good. Hell, it's even hard to make it just sound IN TUNE. Plus, it has a fundamentally supportive role, providing the harmonic and rhythmic foundation on which the music is constructed. Over the decades, bass pioneers have expanded its scope: first, by refining technique; then, by shattering the boundaries of accompaniment and carving out a niche of artistic freedom for themselves. Now bass it's on the same level as any other instrument in jazz: here's a list of the trailblazers who, amongst many many others, have made it happen. Enjoy!

**JIMMY BLANTON**
In a time when bass was relegated to the very background of the jazz ensemble, Jimmy Blanton was one of the few that could share the limelight with other instruments as a legitimate soloist. He brought amazing technique, sound and intonation into the best orchestra Duke Ellington ever had.

1940: [Pitter Panther Patter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJlV0Agi1w) duet with the Duke.

1940: [Cotton tail](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbOseBw-fnU) with the Duke Ellington orchestra.

**SLAM STEWART**
Killer swing and a distinctive solo style, with bowed bass doubled by scat vocals. An unsung hero.

1945: [I got rhythm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ypn2rWvFA) with Don Byas on saxophone.

1979: [Tangerine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI2QqJ2QlM8) with Hank Jones (p) and Peter Appleyard (v).

**RAY BROWN**
Fantastic walker. One of the swingingest cats around in the history of jazz. Plus, he married Ella so you know he was good. 

1950: [Improvised tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeCmvnzcECQ) with Hank Jones (p) and Buddy Rich (d).

1961: [The man I love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacjJiKqfjo) with the Oscar Peterson trio.

**CHARLES MINGUS**
Mingus was a world-class composer. But he wasn't a slouch on the bass either: incredible technique, a master of feel and timing. A true giant amongst giants.

1950: [Move](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Pkkxp6JFM) with the Red Norvo trio.

1962: [Fleurette africaine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vUHaSB1adI) with Duke Ellington (p) and Max Roach (d).

**OSCAR PETTIFORD**
Rock solid, excellent composer. He pioneered the use of cello in jazz as a soloing instrument.

1953: [Blues in the closet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWLo8xkOxDc); in this cut Oscar plays the cello.

1954: [Marcel The Furrier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syVQSN11LyY) with his sextet.

**PAUL CHAMBERS**
Huge, velvety sound and a swing to kill for. His work with Miles Davis is the stuff of legend; then he went on to record on Monk's *Brilliant Corners* and Coltrane's *Giant Steps*.

1956: [Dexterity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUCj199D378) with John Coltrane as sideman (!).

1958/59: [So what](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHzs7Fknpw) with the Miles Davis quintet.

**SCOTT LA FARO**
Scott was one huge step ahead on the long and winding road of bass liberation. His comping was melodically sculpted and rhythmycally relentless. Awesome musicianship. 

1958: [Chart of my heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4CrJ9lyzE) with the Richie Kamuca quintet.

1961: [Alice in wonderland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuzZ8mV9Zh8) with the Bill Evans trio.

**JIMMY GARRISON**
One of the very best on the scene in the 1960s. He recorded extensively with Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane, very often in association with *drummer extraordinaire* Elvin Jones. Inventive, sombre, intellectual in his approach; a tone as big as a mountain. One fine example of a very, very serious player for whom music mattered most.

1961: [Milestones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T28lWfb-7o), tearin' it up with the Walter Bishop Junior trio.

1963: [After the rain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2faoL66ozw) with the John Coltrane quartet.

**REGGIE WORKMAN**
An old lion (still performing and teaching at 74). Played with Art Blakey, Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan and, more recently, with pianist Mal Waldron. His tone has a hard edge to it, with a strong percussive attack. 

1962: [Caravan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP12RhmBIRw) with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers.

1975: [Amy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMT_yH31Uo) with bassoon player Makanda Ken McIntyre.

**RON CARTER**
THE master walker. He was instrumental  in establishing the greatness of the second Miles Davis quintet, and has been the godfather of jazz bass ever since. 

1964: [Joshua](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o40smfOyIso) with the Miles Davis quintet.

1974: [117 Special](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7a5Ekloaqo) from his *All Blues* LP.

**NIELS-HENNING ØRSTED PEDERSEN**
If the bass world was Walhalla, he would have been Thor. Unsurpassed, effortless technique and mind-blowing solos.

1964: [Beautiful love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlPv0szwxVw) with the Bill Evans trio.

197?: [Move](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDtbz2KHmiI) with Joe Pass (g).

**CHARLIE HADEN**
He recorded Ornette Coleman's seminal LP, *The shape of jazz to come*, when he was just 22. He is the leader of the Liberation Music Orchestra and has got a major jones for duets (he played with Keith Jarrett, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Pat Metheny, Richard Galliano, Hank Jones, Kenny Barron amongst others). His style is very subdued and melodic, yet extremely poignant.

1959: [Lonely woman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNbD1JIH344) with Ornette Coleman.

2001: [Nocturnal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTeVod4eH5k) with pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba.

**STANLEY CLARKE**
One of the very few bi bassists. Innovator on the electric, exceptional on upright.

1977: [School days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOaRG_1SDa4).

2010: [Black narcissus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LM30TBrtO4) featuring Hiromi Uehara (p).

**JACO PASTORIUS**
This man needs no introduction, so I'm not gonna write one. Buy his first album (the self titled *Jaco Pastorius*) today.

1978: [Birdland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgTjKf5FK4k) with Weather Report

198?: [Donna Lee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=I4rfe5xHCIg) with his orchestra.

**DAVE HOLLAND**
Yet again a proof that Miles could choose his musicians. He replaced Ron Carter in the Miles Davis group in the late 60s, then moved on to a fantastic career as sideman and composer. Precise attack, powerful tone and mastery of technique make him one of the very best.

1973: [Conference of the birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SQXLaNXvGA), his best known composition.

2003: [Mr. P.C.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHu6rzmUvFI), solo performance.

**GARY PEACOCK**
He started working in the early sixties with West Coast giants like Art Pepper and Paul Bley, then he moved to New York and played with Bill Evans and Albert Ayler. He studied zen and biology, and is best known for his long-standing collaboration with pianist Keith Jarrett and drummer Jack De Johnette. Together, they form one of the best and most prolific trios since the 80s. 

1986: [Woody'n you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcz4XLuafJg) with Keith Jarrett and John De Johnette.

1997: [Witchi Tai To](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_iaZESVRuo) with Ralph Towner (g).

**CHRISTIAN McBRIDE**
The epitome of the modern jazz bassist. Equally adept at both the electric and acoustic instrument, bandleader, arranger, producer, pop session man, jazz virtuoso. The man has it all.

I’ve tried to list the main players while giving mention to others who are related by either being influenced by, influencing, or playing at the same time/style as the listed person. I’ve also made a “Current Generation” section to comments players today.  

**Art Tatum**-Considered as ‘God’ within jazz dynasty. Extremely virtuosic and technical in his playing, Tatum had the ability to create sheets of notes running independently between hands. Steeped deeply in the stride piano style, Tatum’s playing had lots of left hand alternating root/fifth with chords (1,chord, 5,chord, etc). Although he fell out of popularity with the advent of Bebop, He’s still idolized by today’s players as being one of the greatest pianists of all time and set the foundation and level for piano players onwards.

(See Also: James P Johnson, Fats Waller, Scott Joplin, Jelly Roll Morton)

**Bud Powell**-One of the two leaders of Bebop piano. Bud came up out of the stride era of piano and ventured away from it by keeping his left hand sparse and simple while pushing the boundaries in his right hand soloing. Noted for his ability to play at fast tempos while keeping his time clean, Bud was considered to rival Charlie Parker in his solos.

**Thelonious Monk**-The other leader of Bebop piano. Best known for his distinctive playing sound, and unique compositions. Explored the use of dissonant notes and chord voicings. Deliberate use of silence and unusual rhythmic ideas set him apart from his contemporaries of Bebop by looking for the ‘wrong notes’ and the ‘sound between the notes’. Well known for his unique compositions that explored new chord progressions and melodic ideas (Well You Needn’t, Round Midnight, Epistrophy, Bright Mississippi and many more). Beyond his playing, Monk is known for his strange demeanor and mannerisms on the stage, that being dancing and singing in the middle of songs when he wasn’t playing.

**Oscar Peterson**-The Maharaja of the keyboard, Peterson was the one of the longest serving pianists in jazz history, with a career ranging from the 40s till past the turn of the century. Peterson came up playing in the Montreal lounge scene where “Cutting” contests (basically a one-up the other guy) were a big part of the gigs. Eventually got picked up by Norman Granz and got his big break playing at Carnegie Hall. Peterson was noted for his technical prowess and mind-boggling speed.  His virtuosity was next to none, with hands that spanned a 10th at resting position, he was known for lines that flew up and down the keyboard with ease. Peterson adapted into the genres of jazz coming along while still holding true to the traditional sounds; exemplified in his ability to cut out the band and go to a high paced stride solo in the middle of songs. Peterson is one of the extreme few Jazz musicians who never fell into drug use during his tenure, which may have led to him having such a long career. During the mid-nineties Peterson suffered a stroke and was paralyzed in the left side of his body. He eventually made a recovery and returned to performing.

**Bill Evans**-One of the most influential piano players of the modern era of jazz. Came up in the scene during the 1950s and briefly played with Miles Davis’s band. Although he left to pursue his own projects, Evan’s returned to Miles’ band to record Kind of Blue. Kind of Blue is a marking point where Evan’s reinvented the approach to chord voicing by opening up the notes in to fourths and fifths (inspired my impressionist music of Debussy), as opposed to the traditional thirds and seconds. While developing the expansion of voicings, Evans made great use of Block Chord technique (created by Phil Moore, made popular by George Shearing); harmonizing the melody note in the right hand with a full chord underneath, usually with the melody doubled an octave down in the left hand. Evan’s then went on to work primarily on his own projects, mostly based around the piano trio (piano bass drums) setting.  Evans’ is credited greatly for progressing the dynamic of the piano trio, bringing out the bass and drums more for solos and interaction. Although his trio work is extensive, Evan’s has notable work in duo and solo projects, such as with Conversations with Myself, and Undercurrent with Jim Hall.

**McCoy Tyner**-Noted for his incredible energy and intensity at the piano, McCoy’s sound is one of the most distinctive in jazz. The most recognizable characteristic of his is low booming fifth in his left hand (sometimes referred to as ‘bomb-drops’) and antiphonal fourth-voicings in his right. His soloing is generally very staccato and busy, based mostly on pentatonics and triad pairs; an approach learned and developed with John Coltrane. Tyner played mostly with Coltrane at the beginning of his career, which led to him being able to later pursue his own projects with his trios and quartets. Tyner’s sound was a healthy mix between the new free and fusion sounds making their way into jazz and the hard bop that was already happening.

**Herbie Hancock**-Herbie started out playing as a sideman in the early sixties and eventually found himself playing in Miles’ Second Great Quintet. During this time he helped redefine the role of the rhythm section with Ron Carter and Tony Williams. While playing for Miles, Herbie played on many records including his own that helped define Post-Bop. Herbie was one of the first piano players to embrace keyboards and electronic instruments; he endeavored with them into early fusion work. However Herbie shifted from fusion to more funk inspired music with his Headhunters album, and through this he’s successfully crossed over into many other genres such as Hip Hop and R&amp;B.

**Chick Corea**-Got the same starting as Herbie, just a little bit after him. Corea eventually replaced him in Miles’ band and went on to be included on Bitch’s Brew. Before Bitch’s, Corea released a number of his own records including Now He Sings, Now He Sobs which became a very influential trio album (Roy Haynes, Miroslav Vitous). Corea went on to form Return to Forever, which focused on electric instrumentation and incorporated latin musical elements. Towards the later eighties Chick started a new group called The Elektric Band, and one moving back to traditional jazz sounds called the Akoustic band. Chick’s playing used many elements of McCoy Tyner’s sound including fourth voicing’s and pentatonic scales. A large part of his playing embraced the latin elements that were being incorporated into jazz at the time. I belief has at times brought tensions with band members.

**Keith Jarrett**-As with Corea, and Hancock, Jarrett came up playing the jazz circuit and got picked up by the Jazz Messengers, then Charlse Loyd, and eventually Miles’ electric band. Jarrett played alongside Corea and stayed in the band awhile after his departure even though he didn’t like electric instruments. During the seventies, Jarrett began doing more quartet based work and began utilizing elements of avant-garde music, gospel, post bop and eventually European folk. Jarrett also redefined the constructs of Solo Piano by straying away from more prepared tune arrangements to extended and fully improvised songs lasting up to and hour long. While exploring his own compositions and fellow musicians, Jarrett found a new niche in his Standards Trio playing just Jazz Standards. The Standards Trio went on to become a huge success and helped in reviving the interest in adapting Standards. Jarrett is known for often standing up while playing and singing and moaning loudly. Jarrett is also a proficient alto sax player, and recorded a number of tracks and albums on horn instead of piano. One of the only Jazz musicians who has been featured prominently on Classical recordings.

1358384188.0,92,self.Jazz,16pyfk,Max Roach,dividedguy,103,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/16pyfk/max_roach/,"Let's talk about him.  This will be wordier than usual for this subreddit, but I feel compelled for some reason to pay tribute to one of my favorite musicians.  I've had this queued up for a while, but that complain-y post about the lack of discussion motivated me to actually put it up.  Scroll down to skip my bullshit and find links to some overlooked Max Roach music.

Max is universally regarded as one of Jazz's great drummers, but in my opinion he doesn't quite get the credit he's due as a musician and a visionary who occupied jazz's cutting edge for decades.  

Max emerged in the 40's as the most innovative and consequently most important bebop drummer.  While Monk and Kenny Clarke held court at Minton's, Max was holding it down at Harlem's other new music cauldron, Monroe's.  On [Charlie Parker's recording debut as a leader in 1945](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okrNwE6GI70&amp;hd=1), Max set a blazing pace, raising countless hairs on the necks of jazz drummer everywhere.  He lit a fire under the asses of Bird, Diz, Bud and others for a decade.  When the greatest beboppers assembled to play [Massey hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6ZjgGVNioo), Max's exclusive claim to the throne was self-evident.  

As bebop's influence plateaued toward the end of the 40's, Max pushed the music in new directions.  With Miles Davis, Gil Evans and others, he laid both the intellectual and musical foundation for cool jazz.  More importantly, he hooked up with a young trumpeter named [Clifford Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXPzAasKWQg) to help forge the sound of modern jazz.  Max Roach and Clifford Brown are, as I see it, among the very few, along with Miles Davis, Art Blakey and Horace Silver who were responsible for the hard-bop aesthetic that dominated jazz in the 50s.  During this period, he also found time to contribute heavily to landmark recordings by [Sonny Rollins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59aXJ8GvMYE) and [Thelonious Monk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TLEPQZIVOg), among others. 

Had Max never played another note after Clifford Browns death in 1956, we'd still revere him.  My favorite period in Max's career, however, came between 1958-1962, when his music gradually grew more personal, more political and a bit more ""out"".  Max's greatest gift, aside from his playing, was his ability to recognize and surround himself with extraordinary talent.  Starting in 1958, after tinkering for a while with the Clifford Brown band minus Clifford, he seemed to steer his career entirely toward discovering and gathering young musicians.  Over the next few years, he attracted a stable of talent that included Abbey Lincoln, Eric Dolphy, Booker Little, Julian Priester, Clifford Jordan, Art Davis and others.  These musicians were not just relatively young and supremely talented, but each of them straddled the avant-garde, pushing boundaries, but still swinging.  I read an interview with Joe Chambers in which he suggests that the loosely associated musicians with whom Chambers played in the 60s, which included some of the above, actually represented the most successful avant-garde movement in jazz because of their fluency in all styles.  I think Max might have had a similar philosophy.  He attracted musicians who were willing to bend, without completely breaking the tradition that he himself was so instrumental in shaping.   The result, in my opinion, is some of the most successful post-bop of the period.  Had Max recorded on Blue Note, I have no doubt his recordings of this era would be considered stone-cold classics.  Instead, they're somewhat forgotten.

Max's recording career slowed down in the early 60s.  I've read that his political activities made recording more difficult, but I'm not sure of the details.  But that's one more thing I want to say about Max Roach.  He was a person of incredible dignity and self-respect.  In the 50's, he started one of the first artist-run record labels in order to free himself from having to subjugate his art to someone else's business.  In the 60s, he recognized the epochal struggle for human rights happening around him and unabashedly made his music part of it.  If his career suffered for it, he never complained (to my knowledge anyway), and I believe that's one of the reasons he was recognized as one of jazz's great elder statesmen until the day he died.  

Wow, that was long.  Anyway here are tracks from some of the great Max Roach albums of the late 50s and early 60s.  The truth is I don't have *that* much to say about them, but if you haven't had a chance to dig too deeply into this part of Max's career, please do and I hope you enjoy.  

**[Max Roach + 4 on the Chicago Scene, 1958](http://open.spotify.com/album/5LydsZYxcmCRzzTWNjsfbj)**

This one isn't up on youtube, but check it out on spotify.  It's his first (I think) with Booker Little.  Truthfully, it's still got that basic hard-bop feel, but he's starting to assemble the pieces for something more.  It also speaks to his eye for and dedication to attracting talent that he was able to replace Clifford Brown with Booker Little.  At 20 years old, Little is a fully-realized trumpet player with Clifford-like clarity and tone.  He was still growing and a composer and arranger and Max would be there with him until his early death.

**[Deeds, Not Words, 1958](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxe__B9IuQQ&amp;hd=1)**   

This is where it starts to come together for me.  Still with Booker Little and George Coleman and adding 17 year old Ray Draper on Tuba, Max seems to be experimenting with instrumentation and arrangement.  Even the old standard linked here sounds very modern.  I wonder if it's Booker Little doing the arrangements, but I'm not sure.  Also, even if it's not yet in the music, Max's political tendencies start to show in the album title.  Finally, the album art is just amazing.   

**[We Insist!, 1960](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTGUkQQkttg&amp;hd=1)**

Skipping ahead a bit, this is Max's first full-fledged musical statement on black history, civil rights and pan-africanism.   The music's hard-edge hints at the nascent black power movement.  The lyrics are by Oscar Brown, Jr., who is worth checking out for his own work as a singer-songwriter.  This video is from a powerful televised performance in Germany.  I have to imagine Max would have had a hard time getting this on the air at home.  It speaks for itself.  

**[Percussion Bittersweet, 1961](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/2415812)**

This is my favorite Max Roach album.  It's got everything characteristic of Max's music at this time -- power and unapologetic politics, strong compositions, the 3/4 time that Max loved and amazing performances by forward-thinking sidemen (and sidewoman), including two of my favorites, Eric Dolphy and Mal Waldron.  I could only find a link to the full album on ustream, but hopefully that works for everyone.  

**[Straight Ahead, 1961](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPPdYv5hp2I)**

This is an Abbey Lincoln album that I absolutely love.  In a short time, Abbey went from a pin-up girl to one of the smartest and most socially-aware singer-songwriters in jazz.  She attributed a lot of that to Max Roach, to whom she was married for some time.  This album speaks to her strength and courage, but also to the positive influence Max had over the people around him.  That, and there's some great playing by Coleman Hawkins.       

**[Money Jungle, 1962](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE4kPbMwXbA)**

Just read the story behind this session.  Here, Max is essentially mediating musically between the greatest musician alive and a man who's somewhere between trying to show him up and breaking down weeping on his shoulder (in the end I think Mingus did both).  Only a special drummer could channel that kind of tension and dysfunction into one of the greatest recordings in jazz.  Max does just that.     

Well, that's it.  Max did a lot more as both a leader and a sideman in this period, so don't stop exploring and feel free to share any good finds.  Also feel free to correct any factual errors or bash me for being insanely long-winded and self-indulgent.  Other than that, enjoy!

As a fan of Phish, I love this aspect and I love how the band is so supportive of it. They go so far to support it that when you buy a ticket you can download the entire concert for free using the barcode as it was recorded through the mixing board. This got me to thinking, why the hell doesn't jazz do that? It seems like the perfect genre because every performance is supposed to be unique, just like a Phish show. I would love to go online and download last night's show. I would love to re-listen to Julian Lage or Eldar perform their stuff live and analyze/memorize their playing styles while discovering a lick I may have missed the night before. I believe you could build an even stronger base of followers while introducing new fans to the genre by giving them a chance to develop a more personal relationship with an unfamiliar artist's music.

He seems to be the chief inspiration that pushed us into being passionate about jazz, the one who, no matter how much our tastes deviate, we can all agree on as being a genius. He's our Bird, man, he's our Duke.

And spending some time in this sub and other online jazz communities seems to indicate that we're not alone. For whatever reason, it seems that for many young jazzers out there, Miles is *it*. Mingus and Trane are pretty big figures too, but none of them seem to have quite as much influence as the Prince of Darkness.

So, two questions.

First, do you agree? Do you think that Miles wields this much influence?

Second, if you do agree, then why do you think that's the case?",,False,,t5_2qmm6,False,,,True,t3_14om5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/14om5p/why_is_miles_the_face_of_jazz/,

So far, it's raised about $15,000 (counting online *and* offline donations) of the $38,000 needed. The campaign ends on October 28.

Wynton Marsalis and Mark Patterson, Vice Chair of Jazz at Lincoln Center, found out about the campaign and made an offer: if it hits $28,000, they will donate the last $10,000 needed. It's pretty awesome.

The cause has gotten local press attention and almost 300 people have donated so far, but I think we're exhausting the normal outlets and need to reach out to targeted music blogs, music-related media outlets, groups of people who are seriously passionate about music and jazz.

The station is operated in cooperation with the NPR affiliate I work for and had a rash of hosts either not showing up for their shifts or repeatedly calling in sick. It's a mostly-volunteer station.

I love music. All kinds of music. But my knowledge of jazz was and is only somewhat decent. I know most of the biggies by name- Miles, Monk, Dizzy, Louis, Ella, Brubeck, etc. - but I lack in-depth knowledge and context for some of the different genres of jazz. I like most everything I hear and I love playing music on the radio for people. Being able to share music with others is such a wonderful opportunity and I relish every part of it. Especially since it has helped to expand my own appreciation for jazz.

But since I have to program two 4-hour shows a week, I'm often at a loss for things to play. My lack of depth would be quickly evident if I only played artists I knew. So, I've been mining the posts of r/jazz for ideas on stuff to play on my shows. Consequently, most of my shows are peppered with songs and artists that you guys post links to here. Unwittingly, you've helped me program my shows and listeners really seem to like the music I play. I like it to.

So I thought that I should at least give you all a heartfelt ""Thank You"" for being unwitting participants in my radio show. I've slowly weaned myself off relying too heavily on the posts of r/jazz, but they still show up on my shows. I love the medium of radio and the songs and artists that you post here have helped me to be somewhat successful at entertaining my audience. You're awesome!

TL;DR - I've been playing songs and artists posted on r/jazz on my radio show for a few weeks now, all while lurking on this subreddit. 

EDIT: I can't respond to everyone, and it's easier to say this here anyway- Thanks for all of the advice, suggestions and ideas. You guys are awesome!",,False,,t5_2qmm6,True,,,True,t3_jevbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/jevbt/rjazz_i_have_a_confession_to_make/,

I recently discovered you. I think the video submissions are fantastic, and I read quite a few of interesting discussions.

Problem is: the sidebar looks a little empty right now, apart from the excellent intro to early jazz.

I really think a subreddit-wide poll of essential recommended listens is in order. Everybody should suggest 5 titles. The 20 most cited titles win the poll, and become a permanent fixture on the sidebar.

What do you think, mods and jazzitors? Should it be done?

Cheers!

Why just not allow everything ? Because image are easier to see, to judge and upvote, even bad ones. Long texts, long songs ask more time to be judged, and therefore gets upvoted less. Redditors (yeah, me too), like a quick shot of easily get gratification, in the form of a midly amusing image.

That's why we must put some rules.

I hope we find a nice set of rules that will fit everybody.

Please upvote this post, so people can decide !

**TL;DR: Write your pics rules and upvote them !**

**Result EDIT**: There is an overwheliming will to have a stronger moderation regarding images.

So here are the rules, voted by /r/jazz :

* No memes, advice animals, or rage comics
* No bandwaggoning (no ""[fixed]"", no ""no, this is the ..."" type posts; post in the original thread)
* No picture of text
* Don't put your whole collection, that's useless to the discussion

Post that don't follow them *will* be removed.

* Album cover are ok, however get the conversation started !

Reminder : everything is welcome in [/r/musicpics](/r/musicpics).

Do other instrumentalists ever mention trombonists when talking about their favorite musicians?  I know that a lot of us are inspired by the greats (Coltrane, Miles, Bird, etc.) but I haven't heard anybody other than trombonists talking about a J.J. record, a great recording by Carl Fontana, or Frank Rosolino's virtuosity in the way we talk about other greats.

We decided to enrich the sidebar here at r/jazz, both for newcomers and returning visitors. We're gonna have an approximately weekly segment called An Introduction to..., where we are going to introduce different areas of jazz - the piano trio, jazz flute, and so on, ranging from the beginnings to ultramodern stuff, hopefully with YouTube videos and recommended listening references.

I decided to start with a subject close to my heart, jazz guitar. I am concentrating here on the basic, most important guitarists in the history of the music, as well as those who I think are most interesting or representative of what is going on right now. If anyone feels as though their hero has gone unsung, comment and they might be added.

* 
Freddie Green

Freddie Green was the working guitarist in the Count Basie Orchestra. He never took solos, played unamplified unless in very large venues, and generally took on a very unassuming role. He usually played the simplest voicings possible, just the third and seventh (i.e. B and F on a G7), but there is a beautiful story about him: supposedly one day he got food poisoning right before the gig and couldn't play, and the drummer and bass player in the Orchestra, who had grown so accustomed to him, kept speeding up, slowing down, and the whole band played terribly that night.

* 
 Charlie Christian

The first guitarist to really explore the electric guitar as a frontline in mainstream jazz. His solo on [Swing to Bop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce9Jtl9D6FQ) is highly regarded to his day.

* 
 Django Reinhardt

Belgian gypsy guitarist who lived all of his life in France. Had two of the fingers on his left hand (the fret hand) badly burnt in a fire, so on solos, he only played with the index and middle fingers. Despite this, he has become the single most idolised person in jazz, adored by gypsy jazz fans around the world - there are whole websites dedicated to him and [picks ](http://www.djangobooks.com/picks/moustache-picks/)made with his moustache on them. His solo on [Minor Swing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTlo809EIlo&amp;ob=av2n) is played as a theme by some guitarists today.

* 
Wes Montgomery

Wes is definitely one of the most influential guitarists. He developed his trademark thumb-picking technique when he had to practice at night in the small apartment that he shared with his wife and child, who were asleep, so he had to play as quiet as possible in order not to wake them up. He also popularised playing in octaves (which he got from piano players) as well as being the first player to play extented and imaginative chord solos. [Four on Six](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHZ4R_glXr8) is a great tune from an album that is worth a listen, as is Boss Guitar or Bumpin' (although by that, he had moved more into a poppy setting).

* 
Jim Hall

Jim Hall might just be the most underrated guitarist (still) playing today. His book Introducing Jazz Guitar shows an advanced mastery of the art and craft, and he is one of the most intellectual players there are, in the best way possible. This [live concert](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6xAkULRuUk&amp;feature=related) includes a string quartet playing the piece he wrote as his graduation work in university.

* 
Joe Pass

Joe Pass will perhaps be best remembered for his work on the solo guitar improvised jazz context, which he took further than anyone else in the straight-ahead vein. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWa6aChSf1w) he is playing an absolutely beautiful version of All The Things You Are with his trio.

George Benson

George Benson, as well as being a great guitarist with a full, round tone that many people try to copy, is also an accomplished vocalist in his own right, more suitable for fans of pop-jazz and beautiful ballads on a cozy winter night, or for those just getting into jazz. Here he is singing what some might consider his trademark song, [This Masquerade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpEfAV1T5b0).

* 
Pat Metheny

Too many fans would hate if I didn't say anything about Metheny. While his technique, touch and feeling are amazing, and in some contexts work perfectly ([sorry to post All The Things You Are again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8j_LRFO4Lc)), but some of us might have a problem with some of the more (for lack of a better word) cheesy stuff he does in his Group with Lyle Mays.

* 
John McLaughlin

Interesting to guitarists in particular as being the only well known guitarist to play with classical as opposed to violin-style left hand technique, and to musicians for his use of Indian classical music. He is perhaps best remembered today for his work with the [Mahavishnu Orchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSIEkPqVgk) and Miles Davis' breakthrough jazz-rock album [Bithes Brew](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIqSbvktrYo).

* 
John Scofield

John Scofield is a modern player in the most urban sense. Moving from straight-ahead jazz, to some of the most amazing funk with [Medeski Martin and Wood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71oTuy63EU0), he's at home everywhere. From techno-jam-band Uberjam, through fusion on Blue Matter to his quartet with Mulgrew Miller, John is always great to see.

* 
Kurt Rosenwinkel

Probably the most influential guitarist in terms of the contemporary mainstream sound. His innovative use of effects as well as newer harmonic devices (most notably stacked fourth chords) and extended composition, as well as a skill to choose amazing sidemen (Jeff Ballard, Mark Turner and Ben Street just to name the ones in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAkONsjZhTY). His album Heartcore might be a bit overelectronicallyproduced for some, but Enemies of Energy is a beautiful piece of modern jazz.

* 
Bill Frisell

Moving into more modern territory, Bill Frisell plays things often heavily influenced by Americana, country or folk music, and sometimes by art-rock. Mixing beautiful [solo pieces](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svzv-YkUzdk) to [larger ensembles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD26t_GtUTY&amp;feature=related), you can never know what to expect from him.

* 
Ben Monder

Although I'm sure I've ommited many great guitarists, I will end this list by moving from the more modern to the more Monder. First, I have to say that Ben Monder is, by my standards, the best jazz guitarist alive today. Technically I'm pretty sure that's true, and his compositions on his own albums (especially Oceana, an absolute masterpiece) show great artistic heights. At least listen to [this](http://grooveshark.com/#/s/Oceana/2B4qZG?src=5). I'm super cereal.

Anyway, that's it for now, please comment and let me know what you would like changed or which segment you would like to come next - if anyone feels particularly close to a certain subject, feel free to do one as well.

Edit: In order to only include people who are very very important (it is an introduction), if you feel your hero has gone unsung, put his name in the comments and if you get 5 upvotes, he will be added.

Edit: Added Green, Benson, Rosenwinkel and McLaughlin. But guys, please bear in mind that this is an introduction - though I love Stanley Jordan and Charley Byrd and many other names, they really don't fit into an introduction. I know you're going say that neither does Ben Monder, but that was just my little reward to myself for taking the time to do this :)

C E G B D F#

sounds quite a bit better than

C E G B D F

for various reasons. A big part of it is because of how the F clashes with the E and B under it. I'm sure there are other reasons too, involving overtones, but I'm not very knowledgeable about that stuff.

However, you can only stack the lydian mode so far before getting a bad-sounding note. Try this:

F A C E G B D F.

That top F sounds pretty bad. I think it's due both to the the intervals it forms with lower notes, as well as the diminished triad (B D F) at the top, and there is away to avoid that--that is, you can avoid having any diminished or augmented triads by simply alternating between major and minor thirds, like so:

C E G B D F# A C#

and you can go further

C E G B D F# A C# E G# B D# F# A# C# F Ab C Eb...

As you stack thirds, the choice above seems to be the least dissonant or unstable sounding, even though it is highly chromatic (after 24 notes, it will have all 12 unique pitch classes).

This 'chord' does have compound minor 9ths and tritones, but they're separated by several octaves.

Has anyone else noticed this? any thoughts? has this been used in any way by composers or improvisers?

So we're playing, he's digging it, life's good.
We get to the blues tune where I take a solo. The solo starts mid chorus (bar 5), I stand up, and start blowing.
8 bars later, he cuts off the band. At this point I'm like ""Oh shit, did I really manage to fuck up a Bb blues?""
He asks me how long I've been playing. I tell him seven years. He says he can tell, it's obvious I know my stuff on the horn.
Then he proceeds to tell me that I'm in my own little world. I'm playing to myself. By myself. For myself.
He was right. Not necessarily cliched licks, but the usual type of thing I'd play over blues.
There was no story in my solo, no interaction between myself and anyone else.

So, he proceeds to tell me to imagine that I have a wife and kids. I love them a lot.  However, the jazz police take them away from me.
They line them up against a wall, ready to shoot them in the head.
They give me the opportunity to play one more solo. That determines their fate.

So then he says ""Now, play that solo.""

And I did.

It wasn't some reincarnation of Cannonball's brilliance or a Grammy-winning solo.
It wasn't even technically difficult, just a slight step up from cliched pentatonics and blues licks.
But it was in the groove.
So we keep going, it's like 4 and a half choruses.

Halfway through, he stops it again.

I'm going ""oh shit oh shit oh shit""

But then he turns to the rhythm section and says ""Listen up. You guys are on the verge of killing this man's family. He's listening to you. You better damn well listen to him.""

And then we did it again.

A rant I wrote about traditional jazz remains pinned to the sidebar, which flatters me. But eventually I unsubscribed for a reason that, having recently re-subscribed, is probably going to lead me to unsubscribe again.

Almost everything posted to this sub is simply a link to a YouTube video of some performance or recording. Few of them ever get more than a dozen upvotes--despite almost 25,000 subscribers--and few of them get more than one or two comments. Why? My strong belief is that it's because these posts suddenly appear, with no context or annotation. Essentially, they're just links to things that various members--for whatever reason--think ""sound cool."" But if I'm in the mood to hear a random selection of jazz recordings, I don't need Reddit for that. I can sign in to Pandora, or got to any one of dozens of sites, or just link around on YouTube on my own.

Yesterday, user Pukedukem posted a link to a song called ""The Brightness of these Days"" by the Kyoto Jazz Massive. It's 6 minutes and 16 seconds long. Assuming that I'm browsing in a place where I can even listen to music, why am I going to take 6 minutes to listen to this? I've never heard of the song or the artists. What genre is it? What does the OP like about it? What should I listen for? How does it exemplify, or contrast with, Japanese jazz--or jazz in general? It's gotten so bad that when I see *any* context in the title (""nice blues with merengue rhythm""; ""unique combination of jazz/beat-boxing""; ""Here is Morphine, a pretty unknown group that existed until 1999""), I'm delighted.

Jazz is a huge world, and I doubt there's one of us who's an expert in every genre, artist, instrument, and technique. The best thing that we can do in this subreddit is *teach each other*. To this end, my recommendation is that when posting such links, the OP writes a couple paragraphs about the music and why he or she thought we should all listen to it. If I was posting, say, a link to [Sonny Rollins's ""Autumn Nocturne""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_tOlwXbOsE), I might say something like this:

***

Rollins recorded this live at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco in 1978, and it appeared on his ""Don't Stop the Carnival"" album. The song was written in the 1940s by Kim Gannon and Josef Myrow and was never very popular in its ""straight"" version (you can hear an instrumental version by Lou Donaldson [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRRv6B47mI), and a vocal version by Sarah Marie Young [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gVZHl3GVbg)).

For the first four minutes, Rollins exhibits pure artistry in his variations, rarely playing more than a few notes of the straight melody. At 04:05, he starts playing a regular rhythm to signal the rest of the band. Most important, notice the enormous sense of release that accompanies the entrance of the other instruments at 04:13, finally giving us a baseline. The obviously-exhausted Rollins plays a few more triumphant choruses before concluding the performance.

***

Now, I don't have a strong opinion about whether such commentary should be in a text posting or the first comment; probably the latter, since it's unlikely to get lost, and the OP can get the link karma. But either way, readers would learn more and have a basis for a stronger discussion in the comments.

Thanks for listening.

I'll be spotlighting their visit (live blog) and I'll have a chance to ask then some questions. I'm taking suggestions as to what I should ask them. I aslo could ask them to do an AMA. Is it something you'd be interested in? Let me know the best way to do that.

EDIT: Cool, got everyone's questions (so far) Will try really hard to deliver :) Robert Glasper Experiment has arrived in Riga. Here's the link to the live blog http://gotlatte.com/rigas_ritmi/bde7fe

EDIT 2: Just met Andreas Varady with his father and brother. They are here for the festival as well. Really cool guys. My collegue will be spotlighting them for 2 days in Riga if you want to see the story it's here http://gotlatte.com/rigas_ritmi/12919a Added more of your questions to my list. It's 00:00 AM now in Riga. In 9 hours I'll be meeting Robert Glasper. Will check this reddit post for more questions in the morning.

EDIT 3: The day of following Robert Glasper is over. It was a cool experience. Robert's Q&amp;A was superb, he's a cool guy and the way he answered questions was just mesmerizing. I got a chance to ask him some of your questions so here they are: 
–Regarding collaboration with Frank Ocean: ""Maybe, he’s not on the top of list of people to collaborate with but it could happen."" When asked who Robert wants to do a collaboration with Björk and Thom Yorke were the first to be mentioned.
–Regarding tours: ""I'll be in Rhode Island in August and will start touring the US in September.""
–Regarding the AMA: ""I've heard of reddit and people did mention doing an AMA to me before. We'll see.""
Sorry for not getting all the answers you were hoping for.

Tomorrow I'll be meeting MMW and will report on how that went.

EDIT 4: It's been a terrific day. Met John Medeski, Billy Martin and Chris Wood today. Awesome guys and the way they play is just that more amazing. I couldn't believe 1.5 hours went by so quickly. I had a chance to speak to the regarding your questions so here they are:

About the records and/or live shows with John Scofield.
–Yes, they are planning to do a collaboration with John Scofield next year. They call him uncle John :)
About when the album with skerik and Adam Deitch is coming out.
–This Fall! 
About collaboration between MMW and Antibalas
–They would love to do it but it's difficult both financially and time (a lot of people in Antibalas). 

Lastly, I told MMW all about reddit and doing an AMA here. They were pretty excited about it and would love to do one.

I would just start buying up albums but I would go broke fast and I'm afraid of getting something was isn't very good. 

Really suggestions on all artists are welcome, Bill Evans was just a starting point.

Also, I like just about every kind of jazz from Big Band and swing to fusion and a Cool Jazz. I'm a bari sax player, so having that as a prominent feature never hurts

**EVERYONE**

* We're all here to make beautiful music together. You should be able to do that with an advanced pyrotechnician or a first-timer. Everyone is responsible for making the music sound great.

* Play at a volume appropriate to the venue. If you're in a cafe, that might mean brushes and no amps.

* Keep your instrument silent between songs.

* Keep your instrument silent between sets. Never play once the house music is on.

* Listen to music away from the gigs! Know the names of the songs and their forms.

* I've played with a lot of great vocalists who didn't know exactly how jazz worked, so this may be review for a lot of you. Jazz jam sessions/casuals work like this:  It's best if you pick a song from the books the band carries around. This is the canon of music that local musicians know and you'll get the best results if you choose from it. Solos aren't a free-for-all -- the song keeps the same structure throughout.  You sing the beginning, and then instruments take turns soloing over the exact same ""form"" you just sang over. It's like the rhythm section keeps playing a karaoke version of what you just sang, and the soloists improvise over it. At the end it will be your turn again. Soloists will be let down if you start singing again and it's not your turn. Stand off to the side and follow the form (the easiest way to do that is to can keep singing the song over and over in your head ). Hopefully someone will nod or cue you when its your turn to close the song out. Very often, this will happen in the middle of the form -- on the ""bridge"", So look for that.
 
* If you want to do an awesome scat solo, you want the head to come back in on the bridge, or anything special like that, talk about it with the band ahead of time. 

* Have the lyrics memorized. 

* Know what key is good for you for that song. Ideally you pick a song where your key matches up with the key in the band's book/brain. If you have to ask for a different key, bring chord charts if you can.

**HORN**

* Stay focussed while you're not playing.  Follow the form in your head. Keep track of who has soloed and who hasn't. Know when the head is coming back around.

* Don't rush it. Careful that you don't drop a beat/measure in quiet passages/turnarounds.  Those parts are important to the song form and tension/resolution.

* Similar to the advice for the rhythm section, if you think people are getting lost, keep it simple and start laying down melody quotes.


**BAND LEADER**

* Call the tune. Say the name of the song, count it in, and discuss how to start, and any tricky bits (preferably between sets and not on the bandstand), especially if this isn't your regular band.

* Know the song you're going to play next.



**RHYTHM SECTION**

* Most of the time you're playing, you're not the most important member of the band. Who is? The soloist. Your job is to make them sound their best. If they're a newbie, stick to the vanilla chords and rhythms. Bust out your switch to 3/4 time over a Coltrane matrix on someone who's ready for it. 

* Be in control of your dynamics. Bring it down for quiet soloists, like a flute or a bass. The soloist should have plenty of room so they're not completely focussed on producing volume. A great way take control of the dynamics is to bring the entire rhythm section down at the beginning of every new instrument/soloist for a whole A*section or even  a whole chorus, and then build up to the right volume.

* Chord instruments: If the guitar, piano, vibraphone all decide to handle playing the chords, it's going to get muddy. Ideally, you work this out ahead of time. Changing who holds down the chords every few choruses can make for easy, cool dynamics. If you haven't worked it out ahead of time, defer to the piano, with the guitar just playing accents, turnarounds, etc. Less is more. 

* Be careful of your volume/dynamics at all tempos. Fast doesn't always mean loud.

* If you get lost… There's probably someone in the rhythm section who's sort of the section leader. Look to them. If you have to, ask them to call out ""Top!"" when the top comes around, or otherwise show you where they are. Otherwise, strolling/laying out sounds better than playing the wrong chords. 

* If the soloist gets lost… Switch to the most vanilla version of the song you can play. Quote the melody. Lead the spaceship back into dock.

* Keep the tempo as it was called. Otherwise, speeding up is generally preferred to dragging.

**DRUMMER/PERCUSSION**

* A lot of the drummers I've played with are recent converts from some other American style of music (rock, R&amp;B, etc).  The big difference with jazz is that just about every other style has a snare hit on the backbeat. If you do this in jazz, it makes the song swing less. For some reason, the snare on the backbeat tends to creep into ballads. Try to keep the ballads swinging - if you play the backbeat too many times it ends up sounding like a rock power ballad.

* The drums are lower in the mix in jazz than in other American styles. Make sure you're leaving enough room. You should be able to hear the bass clearly, because you need to lock in with the bass player.

* If you're having trouble keeping up with a super-fast song like ""Cherokee"" or ""Anthropology"", don't try. Either lay out, or switch to playing accents in appropriate places. Everyone in the rhythm section has a tendency to play harder when they're trying to keep a tempo past their abilities. This means not only will you be dragging down the  tempo, you'll also be playing over everyone else. Similarly, the secret to nailing those super-fast tunes is to learn to play extremely lightly. Less is more.

* People would rather you trade fours than solo. Trading fours is awesome. Ask about it before the set/before the song.

* Drummers need to learn song too! Know the names of the songs and their forms.

**PIANO**

* You are likely to be the best jazz theorist in the rhythm section, the best reader, and the most likely to speak jazz natively. If that's the case, you can do a  lot to keep everyone from losing the form (see the RHYTM SECTION parts about people getting lost).

* Careful with your left hand. If there's a bass player, let them handle the bass notes. 

**BASS**

* Honestly, bass solos aren't the most popular thing in jazz. keep it to one chorus.

* Know lots of songs. It's easier for the bass to memorize a ton of songs than it is for the chordal instruments. Do it!

* If you use an amp, you may benefit from pointing it at the drummer, especially in smaller places with no monitors.

* If you use an amp, you may cut through the mix better if you cut the bass and boost the mids. Don't lose the thump, though.

Welcome to another part of An Introduction to...This time, we'll be concentrating on jazz saxophone players. This is an area of some expertise for me, but not being a saxophone player, I would love it if some people could comment on actual technical achievements (although they might not be as important as the musical ones). Please feel free to make one of these, but PM me about it first, so if there is more than one person doing the same section, you can work on it together.

So, first, **An Introduction to the Introduction**. I thought since the jazz saxophone has two clear ""winners"", I would post them here first, before I discussed the other ""runners up"".

* Charlie ""Bird"" Parker

The father of bebop. He loved chicken, heroin, hookers and jazz. Listen to anything of his it's all gonna be amazing. Seriously. [Donna Lee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANODMX9c5g), [Confirmation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV6y1f7CU-A) It has become common courtesy to trade Charlie Parker stories, here are some of my favourites:

While still in Kansas City, he went to a jam session where Papa Joe Jones was playing. This was around the time he was trying to figure out how to play more ""out"", play tensions, flat thirteens, sharp elevens, flat nines. He wasn't doing terribly well (understatement) so Papa Joe Jones took off one of his cymbals and threw it at his feet, ending his time playing there. Bird proceeded to practice some more, go back there and kill.

Once Miles Davis - while he was still young, innocent and really into practicing - got in a cab with Bird. Bird was off his face on heroin, and had a whole chicken in his left hand and a bottle of whiskey in the right. He also had a hooker with him, and proceed to have the hooker pleasure his nether regions. Miles was very uncomfortable with this, but Bird didn't give a shit.

One time, when recording ""Lover Man"", Bird showed up to the studio completely wasted. So wasted that he couldn't stand up. But he could play, so two men had to hold him up while he played - [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJpes0XFGU) is what came out of that session. There are endless stories of him trading his saxophone for money at a pawn shop so he could buy some heroin (or chicken) and showing up at a gig, making the band leader go to the pawn shop to get his horn.

* John ""'Trane"" Coltrane

Again, a man that needs no introduction. Famous as the ""star pupil"" of jazz, he was known to practice more than any other jazz musician at the time. The innovations he made... First he divided the octave into three tonal centres on Giant Steps in 1959. In the same year, he pioneered modal jazz on Miles Davis' Kind of Blue album. Then, he moved more into modality with stuff like My Favorite Things. Then, he made one of the most spiritual recordings in jazz, A Love Supreme, a three part suite. Then, he went more into spirituality and free jazz. Then, he died. Listen to [Giant Steps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kotK9FNEYU), listen to [Blue Train](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1GrP6thz-k), and *please* listen to [A Love Supreme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=558bTG0D-xg). Your life *will* be better.

Okay, now for the ""rest of them"" - still amazing musicians.

* Lester ""Prez"" Young

Nicknamed ""Prez"" (short for President), a nickname given to him by Billie Holiday, Lester young has one of the most beautiful tones of jazz saxophone players, which goes perfectly with his lyrical, soft, linear style of playing, which is best heard on ballads, like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtgUbJN8oPE) one with Billie Holiday. One of his best recorded solos is one on [Tea for Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAG_Yo8709o). He was famous for wearing pork pie hats, and upon his passing, Charles Mingues wrote [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sfe_8RAaJ0) beautiful ballad to commemorate him.

* Coleman ""Hawk"" Hawkins

A direct contemporary of Lester Young, Hawkins revolutionised jazz with one particular recording, a cut of [Body and Soul](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sul_9BcgOOI) in which he essentially didn't play the melody at all. Up to then, everyone was improvising on the melody of the song, taking that as a basis for whatever solos they were going to play. Here, Hawkins not only improvises his solo based on the changes (harmony) of the song rather than the tune (melody), but he gets rid of the melody alltogether.

* Sonny Rollins

One of the few jazz greats alive that where there when it all happened in the 50's and 60's, Sonny is still playing at over 80 years of age. He was famed for coming to New York, being great, but thinking that he should be better, thus going ""shedding"" (when you essentially lock yourself up and practice, comes from being in a woodshed), and practicing on the Williamsburg Bridge every night, then coming back and blowing everyone away. His solo on [Tenor Madness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW33ye4fPBA) is legendary, and the recording of his rhythm changes tune [Oleo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ah7unyXbA) with Miles Davis is as good-rhythm-changes as you'll get.

* Cannonball Adderley

Often playing with his brother Nat on cornet, Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley is possibly one of the most underrated horn players in history - here he is playing Nat's famous tune [Work Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBxAC4ywaJ4). You can also hear him on the best selling jazz album of all time, [Kind of Blue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEC8nqT6Rrk), his version of [Nardis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9tNT-Ub2K0) is beautiful and the album [In New York](http://grooveshark.com/#/album/In+New+York/4330264) is an amazing live album.

* Wayne Shorter

Another one of those giants who are still with us today, Wayne's [quartet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkewiFES7vI) is still touring and innovating today, while his tune [Footprints](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XvJFW0DHbU) is one of the most commonly played at jam sessions, both in the minor blues and waltz realms. He played a crucial part in Miles Davis' [second great quartet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_whk6m67VE), and his album [Speak no Evil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njo1zvr216s) is considered a jazz masterpiece by many.

* Joe Henderson

Most famous for supposedly writing one of the ultimate jazz standards, [Blue Bossa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7eOs5lERww), which was actually composed by Kenny Dorham, he is one of the players to really go deep into harmony, mostly pentatonic scale applications, as well as lydian modalities. His tune [Inner Urge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jOIAos3nk) has one of the most interesting harmonies of any featured in the standard repertoire.

If posting these articles is a necessity, tell us why the musician means so much to you.

Many of these articles are posted by the same guy (dc512), and are just generic links to the entire wikipedia article.

So me and 3 other guys are outside a club waiting for the monster saxophonist inside to let us sit in (who, by the way, is a saint in every sense) when two women walk up. 

One is sober(er) and calm. The other is a VERY gregarious and drunken lady with the most strident Valley Girl accent I have ever heard for any reason. If I were to imitate it, you'd think I was playing it up like a bad actor in a bad TV show. In a sibilant drone, she interrogates us--what restaurant is this? What's its address? Which street is it on? Can she call a cab here? Me and the friend with my sense of humor are holding in the laughter at how surreal this is. I whisper to him to stay strong, which makes it worse.

She finally notices my friend's messenger bag, which he uses to carry tunes and such. ""WHAT A CUUUTE BAG,"" she cries and runs her hands up and down it, not bothering to not touch his ass in the process. We all shoot each other a glance. This is ridiculous.

It bears mentioning that we are all facetious-ass MF's. 

I chime in. ""Oh, yeah. We're messengers for sure. Messengers of jazz. Jazz messengers.""

The drummer steps forward, offers a hand, and introduces himself as Art Blakey. 

She goes around the circle and meets Lee Morgan, Benny Carter, and Paul Chambers. Words cannot describe how hard she bought it. We couldn't believe it. Her friend bought it, which was even more incredible. At this point, the monster saxophonist invited us in to jam. 

As soon as we were in, we lost our shit, and that's easily the funniest thing I've ever done.",,False,,t5_2qmm6,False,,,True,t3_x2626,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/x2626/jazz_musiciansfunniest_stories/,

We also spent the afternoon with them in a clinic. It was amazing how down to earth they all were. I was blown away by all of them, obviously, but particularly drummer John Riley, lead trumpeter Tanya Darby and lead alto player Billy Drewes. I also had a pretty good talk about improvising with Ralph Lalama (I'm the lead tenor player in our group). And trombonist John Mosca was the biggest sweetheart ever.

If any VJO fans have any questions about tips they gave us, what any specific musicians are like in real life, etc. etc., fire away! Otherwise, just wanted to share my amazing experience with some people who would understand how cool this was. 

Here's one of their classics, [Groove Merchant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZLvqXFddu0). They closed the show with it last night.

I'm newly appointed mod of r/jazz, I'm very happy, since it's one of communities which is the most consistent in quality.

I took the liberty to update the CSS, hope you like it !

So now we need few more things :  

1. a **LOGO** ! A nice reddit alien, write your ideas there ! Does someone knows how to do that ? ([technical infos on the sidebar there](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditlogos/)) 

2. A **tagline**, on top of the sidebar to describe the subreddit, that just say what r/jazz is in a short but exhaustive form.

3. Have you seen some awesome post, discussion here on r/jazz since last year, so I could link to them in the sidebar ?

4. And last but not least, it would be nice to have some other **mods** here. Who would like to mod this community ? (I mod r/Music as well, for the record) edit : we're good.

If you want to modify stuff in the sidebar, just tell me ! (new subreddit to link to..)

Also, you can make a playlist with everything posted here : http://reddit.tv/#/r/jazz. I linked r/Jazz TV in the sidebar.

1364781191.0,39,self.Jazz,1be6rf,A friend of mine (tenor saxophonist) just played his first gig at a Nudist Resort. Here's his account of the event,senorfantastic,47,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/1be6rf/a_friend_of_mine_tenor_saxophonist_just_played/,"So.  Last night I had my first gig at a little-known location known as the [REDACTED] Nudist Resort.  (Yes, you read that right.)  And hey, since a gig's a gig, and it's more about the stories and music than the pay (ahem), I figured I'd give you a rough recap of that little soiree:

 

6:30: Arrive at destination where the guy working the guard shack gives me directions to the restaurant where the band will be playing.  Director frantically calling me as I'm talking to the guard shack guy, who is very clear that the speed limit going through the resort is 10 mph.  (I presume this is so you can take in the sights.)

 

6:30:10: First full-frontal sighting of a lady strolling down the street in a manner not unlike that of the old Bigfoot movies.  Yes, it's not dark yet.  Yes, I see everything.  Yes, I maintain control of my vehicle.

 

6:35: Park and begin the usual Normandy invasion of load-in.  Spot dudes walking around among the campground, except, unlike the RV park we gigged at earlier in the week, these dudes are -- well, there's just no words for it.

 

6:40: Not possessing of one of the requisite articles of Floridian attire -- a Hawaiian shirt -- I get one from one of the other guys in the band.  He says I can change in the bathroom outside, but I'm thinking, Huh?  I'll change my shirt by the car...I mean, it's not like I'm gonna get in trouble for it or anything.

 

6:45: Safely inside the restaurant, I note the ""strategic lighting"" and disco ball over the dance floor in the center of the restaurant.  Also notice the stage, which will hold ten people, appears to have been built during the Gemini program years, because it looks like it could hold two people.  It's gonna be tight up there tonight, I think to myself.

 

6:46-6:59:59: Frantically sort out first set worth of music.

 

7:00: Hit.  No one on the dance floor yet.  Lighting in our faces, this actually works to my advantage, because I can't really see the dance floor.

 

7:01: Look to my right, see a topless lady at a table.  Hey, no big thing, typical thing you see on a Saturday night restaurant outing, right?  Must.focus.on.chord.changes.

 

7:15: The restaurant manager comes over to complain that the bass player's stand light is getting in people's eyes and that we're too loud.  Because having lights in your eyes is a bad thing at this gig?

 

7:20: We play Dizzy's ""Groovin' High"".  It won't be the only groove I see that night.

 

7:40: We play ""Too Close For Comfort"", which describes the experience of having near-naked near-senior citizens within inches of the bandstand.

 

7:50: We play ""Corner Pocket"".  Now, I'm no billiards player, but I understand that's where the balls go in that particular game.

 

*** 1ST INTERMISSION ***

 

8:00: Second set aka the ""crowd pleaser set"".  Dance floor is starting to pick up.  Choice of attire for men seems to be sandals and unbuttoned button-down shirts.  Attire for women seems to be top optional and/or tight mesh dresses (if you can call them that) that look like they lost a fight with an International Harvester thresher.  Jiggle factor increasing rapidly.

 

8:15: I note that thankfully, due to space limitations, my solos are confined to my chair, so I neither can stand up, or get down on the dance floor.  This is a relief because I don't need any incidental contact with my ultra-shiny tenor sax.  Because buttflesh.

 

8:25: We do ""Johnny B. Goode"", which OF COURSE I rename to ""Johnny's Got Wood"".

 

8:30: We do the EWF rendition of ""Got To Get You Into My Life"", which I promptly and silently rename, ""Got To Get You Into My Wife"".  Then I start laughing to myself at my own dumb jokes.

 

8:35: Just one of many random times I thank my lucky stars there's a music stand obscuring my immediate line of sight.  It's much like a lunar eclipse: The moon(s) pass(es) from one side of my stand, behind it, and out the other side.

 

8:45: We do ""Mustang Sally"".  I hate ""Mustang Sally"".  Can I tell you how much?  Ride, Sally, ride, indeed.  (Editor's note: Please do not ask me what I renamed this tune to.)

 

8:something: Twin-engine blondewich makes her appearance on the dancefloor.  Best thing going for the eyesight that night, this lady has a French mani-pedi, a stripper body, a dude who appears to be her meal ticket, and a black lace/fishnet dress (if you can call it that) that barely covers the top of OHMYGODISTHATWHATITHINKITIS?

 

(Shortly thereafter, the rhythm section began having trouble.  I think the two events are related.)

 

*** 2ND INTERMISSION ***

 

9:00: Third and final set; more ""crowd pleasers"".  Thankfully, one of them is not Criss Cross' ""Jump"".

 

9:10: We play a tune affectionately titled ""Raw Bones"".  I am not making this up.  (It's a trombone feature, of course.)

 

9:25: We play the old chestnut, ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", which of course is renamed to ""I've Got You Under My Foreskin"".  Our poor vocalist has done his best sans eyeglasses the whole evening while singing.

 

9:30-on: The Blondewich's boyfriend keeps calling for us to play some Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, or Dave Brubeck.  Such a tossup.

 

9:40: We play ""You Make Me Feel So Young"", which oddly enough is not true tonight.

 

9:50: We skip ""That Warm Feeling"".  Don't ask what it is.

 

9:55: Oh God.  Here it comes.  I can feel it.  The director calls out ""Y.M.C.A."".  The crowd loves it and packs the dance floor.  Unfortunately, there's just not enough leather and fringe in the world to cover all that's floppin' around.

 

10:00: Encore time!  This'll get 'em going and send 'em out on a high note: ""In The Mood"" by Glenn Miller, which as everyone knows is really entitled ""In The Nude"".  Well, at least everyone in any big band ever of all time, probably including Glenn Miller himself.

 

Oh, and my solos all sucked as usual.

We could define a chord progression, develop a melody and see what happens.

Thoughts? Do we have a rhythm section?


Edit: Looks like we have plenty interested. I'm a sax player by the way. 

Does anyone have experience in music collabs? 
If we start with a standard, we'll have to start with someone in the rhythm section, then slowly add parts. We could also actually arrange something big-band-ish style, although I prefer a small combo sound.

I'm also up for a keys or guitar player just doodling and laying down some moving chords, then improvising a melody over it, adding bass, drums, and repeating until we converge to something nice.

So, any preferences? How should we start?",,False,,t5_2qmm6,1357406557.0,,,True,t3_15zpkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/15zpkv/jazz_players_of_reddit_lets_work_together_to_make/,
