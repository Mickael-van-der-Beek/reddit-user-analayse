1357767199.0,271,self.Seahawks,169t76,Why Richard Sherman is awesome,tarantula13,310,39,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/169t76/why_richard_sherman_is_awesome/,"My brother Richard Sherman seems to be getting a lot of hate in /r/nfl and other team subreddits but hopefully this post will help others understand why he is awesome and not classless or scum like others will lead you to believe. Let's first air out the dirty laundry and start with why a lot of people hate him. He talks trash, a lot. He does this to get under the skin of the receivers and other opposing players he has to face. It works on some people and it doesn't work on others. The fact of the matter though is that it does work, often times more than it should. So why is getting under the skin of the enemy team a good thing? Because it leads people to making irrational decisions. Mix this in with bump and run coverage as well as him trying to get away with as much as possible physically and it pisses people off. Then once you factor in he is the best coverage corner this year (more on this later) you have a recipe for disaster for opposing teams. In a different topic, nightshift said it best [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/166wpt/the_sherman_narrative_how_people_create_facts_to/c7tch9g).

&gt; So what is left for Sherman to do? He really has 2 options. He can either keep doing what he's doing quietly, and totally cancel out the impact of 1 receiver. Or he can try and goad the opposing team into throwing the ball his way. You don't have to just goad the QB to accomplish this, you can goad the entire team and eventually someone will say ""Will someone throw it to blah blah and shut that motherfucker up??"" Make no mistake, this is what Sherman wants. This is his goal. He wants to pick off that pass and his talking and running his mouth is what he does to get under the opponent's skin. They shrug it off for a while, but before long there's an itch. NFL players and coaches are the ultimate egos and they'll be damned if they'll let some young punk skinny bitch run his mouth and beg ME, the ALMIGHTY (whoever) to throw the ball on him! WTF does he think he is?! By the time it get's this far, Sherman has already won.

An example of this is when he has been goading Steve Smith all game and it eventually leads to things like this [gif](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1243603/19603_ShermanISOSlow.gif). Smith rather get physical with Sherman than catch the damn ball on his timing route. People hear the headlines of the ""U MAD BRO"" and such and they jump to conclusions instead of looking into the player as a whole. That constant ribbing on Tom Brady eventually led him to make a poor decision by purposefully throwing at Sherman and he got an interception. That was his goal and he accomplished it. Tom's a smart player and Sherman got under his skin. It's the trash talking before the game, during the game, and after the game that creates this environment that encourages mistakes and poor judgement and Sherman goes the extra mile in order to increase his impact on the game.

The second reason why I love Richard Sherman so much is that he is an amazing shutdown cornerback. He plays a ton of man to man and does bump and run to disrupt timing routes. I'm sure you many of you already know how spectacular Richard Sherman is at playing the position of cornerback, but just in case [here's a link to his stats](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/defense/sort/passesDefended/seasontype/2). He leads the league in passes defended, is second in interceptions, and has one of the lowest passer ratings against him. Pro Football Focus, an advanced statistics site, has him listed as their [best corner in the NFC](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2012/12/19/pro-bowl-roster-2012-nfc/2/) and had this to say:

&gt; In his second season Richard Sherman has cut down the penalty count and is making a strong case for being the best man coverage cornerback in the league in the absence of Darrelle Revis.

He completely shuts down #1 receivers and eliminates their impact from the game when he is guarding them. Since the NFL is turning more and more passing heavy, having an elite corner is a luxury.

What he has started to doing lately though is one of the most impressive things a cornerback can do, baiting the quarterback. Sherman has started to implement this into his play this season and it has worked out spectacularly. He does this in key situations, specifically the red zone and goal line situations. Turnovers in this part of the field have the biggest impact and Sherman has succeeded in making some game changing plays. We first saw this in the Jets game, [video here](http://www.seahawks.com/videos-photos/videos/Highlight-Richard-Sherman-picks-off-Sanchez/01393cb3-da94-47ae-a5d0-6b581836be72). Sherman purposefully leaves a little room to make receivers look open, then he jumps the route. He is forcing mistakes and changing games. Another example is when he baited Kaepernick in the endzone twice. He dropped the pick the first time, but it worked the second time, [video here](http://www.seahawks.com/videos-photos/videos/Highlight-Sherman-picks-off-Kaepernick-in-the-end/00a3273c-31f0-49a9-ad5b-6f60ceb5bc34). This is just one highlight in one hell of a game Sherman had that night.

The last video I want to leave you with is [Sherman picking off Bradford to end the game](http://www.seahawks.com/videos-photos/videos/Bradford-picked-off-by-Sherman-to-end-game/fbbbb1d4-0154-4f74-9ab6-325aa72176a6). To prefix this, Bradford hadn't thrown a single pass to Sherman all game. Bradford respected Sherman and Sherman still wanted to make an impact on the game. This isn't necessarily baiting the quarterback, but it is an example of what a playmaker he can be. When you first watch this video you think ""Man that's awesome Sherman got the game winning interception!"" Then you watch it again. How the hell did Sherman know Bradford was going to throw it there? He read the quarterback's eyes the entire time. He **knew** Bradford wouldn't dare throw the ball on him. He barely gave his receiver the time of day and used his tremendous instincts to end the game. Watch the video again from 0:19. Sherman broke off and left his receiver wide open for a touchdown almost a full second before Bradford starts his throwing motion. Sherman read the decision Bradford made before he even started his throwing motion and yes I needed to say that a second time. How the hell do you even do that? This play astounds me. You watch Sherman's body language the whole play and he is thinking ""The receiver I'm covering is not a threat, if Bradford throws it to this receiver I will undercut the route."" All he needed there was that split second of confirmation from Bradford and he made a complete shift and sprinted to intercept that ball to make it look like he came out of nowhere. This is high level thinking, this is what a mentally prepared person does, and this specific play has me in awe every time I watch it which leads me into my last point.

I absolutely love Richard Sherman's mindset. He is always playing with a chip on his shoulder and I know that term is overused in the NFL but it's true. This isn't Aaron Rodgers being picked 24th in the first round. This is a guy who got drafted 154th overall in the fifth round which means almost every team skipped over him at least 4 times. He was the 34th defensive back taken in that draft. This means that the NFL collectively thought that there were 33 other guys better than him at defending receivers and now he is arguably the best in the league, not just his draft class. Richard Sherman uses this to fuel his fire and is on a quest to be the best. Not to be the best he can be, to be the greatest. He has that desire and it's only his second year, yet he is already one of the best. I can't wait to see how he will truly separate from the rest and ascend into greatness in the coming years. I want to end this with an [absolutely terrific article](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--seahawks--richard-sherman-wants-to--destroy--the-nfl-and-become-the-best-cb-all-time-170800233.html) which goes much deeper into Richard's personality and mindset. I highly recommend that you all read it.

So if you see anyone bashing Sherman calling him a cheater or classless or whatever, link them to this little thing I wrote about my personal favorite player also known as the best cornerback in the league right now.",,False,self,t5_2ryle,1357781074.0,,25,True,t3_169t76,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/169t76/why_richard_sherman_is_awesome/,

I don't really know what to say about me :) It's sad being a lonely Seahawks fan here in Russia :(

I've been a Seahawks fan since I was about 3 years old. My dad moved to Seattle after he and my mom split and I used to watch the games whenever the Seahawks were on TV because my dad went to a lot of them and I thought I'd see my dad on TV.

Eventually I just fell in love with the Hawks. And trust me some of those years being a Hawks fan weren't easy. Especially being a girl, because all these dick holes that hang out in sports bars don't think I know anything about the game. Bitch please.

I got really hellaciously sick this year. Like we thought I had cancer or Hep or any number of things, and even as tired as I was, I would drag myself out to watch the Hawks at whatever place had the Sunday ticket. And for a few hours every Sunday or Monday or Thursday I'd forget about being sick or broke or whatever. I was nothing but the 12th (wo)Man.

My boyfriend doesn't really do sports. He doesn't get it but because he knows it makes me so happy, he'll put whatever Seattle hat or T-Shirt I have handy on himself and go with me and hold my hand or stand on a bar stool or whatever I tell him to do so we can win. He knows it makes me forget the chronic pain and nausea that I've been dealing with. He knows that if we went all the way (and he has this weird feeling we will) that we will most likely be arrested or evicted from our apartment because he hears what a kick I get out of the Real Rob Report. Or there was the BeastQuake he got to experience. Or the 700 times he's come out of the bedroom and asked me if all that noise was actually just coming out of the TV from the stadium.

I just wanted to say thank you, not only to MY Seattle Seahawks for ""taking care of me,"" while I've been sick but also to all of you here for making this an incredible and fun season. I love it.

Now to the point. I have always been disappointed with the highlight videos we get at the end of our games. I'm talking about the nfl.com ones mostly. Some of our most epic games seem to only have 2 minutes worth of highlights in it. I want to change that. If I have enough support from you all here, I plan to edit together Raibles voice (since he is the best sports announcer ever) with the game footage for the best possible highlights! I have been editing for a while now so they would look good too! Let me know what you all think and if you all have any suggestions for the idea!

If Robert Griffin wasn't playing out of his god damn mind (literally just knocked on wood, something tells me this is unsustainable) Wilson would be a huge story.  He's in a virtual tie with Andy Dalton for tenth in the league in QB rating, and he's throwing to nobodies.  Believe me, I'm an expert on rookie QBs who are throwing to nobodies.   He's also got a 63.6 completion percentage which is something most people would beg for from a rookie's performance.

Here's an infographic comparing Wilson to 3 other rookies this year.

http://www.nfl.com/stats/statslab/details?statsType=player&amp;playerId=LUC524055#seasonId=2012&amp;seasonType=REG&amp;position=QB&amp;player1=LUC524055&amp;player2=WIL777781&amp;player3=TAN298716&amp;player4=WEE221487

Luck has more yards (as he would, between having more passing attempts and no Marshawn Lynch to lean on), but Wilson beats him out in virtually every other statistical category.  He's got a better passer rating, a better completion percentage, and a better TD to interception ratio.  In fact, he's the only one of those 4 who have more TDs than picks.  To be fair, if you incorporate Luck's rushing TDs, he's got more touchdowns than turnovers, but Wilson's ratio is still superior.

**edit:** I revise my above statement about Luck.  I didn't realize he's had 8 fumbles.  Wilson is the ONLY one of those 4 with a TD:INT ratio &gt; one.

One mantra in /r/redskins recently has been, ""what's this guy going to show us once he's got some big time playmakers around him?""  You've got every right to ask yourselves the same question.  If what you've got coming to you for the next several years is a more experienced, poised, and polished version of what you've seen in year one, he's going to prove to be a Hell of a pick.  Good luck in the playoff hunt this year.

There is something that, even a year ago, I would have been ashamed of admitting.

But let me start by saying I used to absolutely hate the seahawks. I have always been upset at them for besting us 9/10 times. I have so many bad memories stemming from your franchise. The absolute breaking point was just 3 years ago, we drafted Bradford, and game 17 was a playoff game for both of us. winner goes onto the playoffs. We sucked up the joint, our receivers dropped open passes, and Marshawn ran all over us. I was devestated, and vowed the second the game was over to never watch another game that Seattle would be playing in.

Then, the very next week, I broke the promise to myself, and watched the game against NO. I was excited to see the ""worst team to make the playoffs"" get demolished by the defending world champions. Then, Marshawn motherfuckin Lynch happened. I couldn't help but root for this guy after running possibly the best run I had ever witnessed, and he earned my utmost respect.

Then, last season, while my team was flirting with the prospect of getting Andrew Luck, you guys were the playing competitive (albeit 7-9) football. With the Lynch run forever in my mind, I watched a few games (despite still hating Seattle) just to watch him run. And I was upset with myself (selfishly). 

Quick backstory, my favorite position in the NFL is cornerback. I feel like it is the hardest position to excel at, and it is also the most exciting one to watch. My favorite player of all time is Aeneas Williams, and he should be in the HOF.

But I digress, as I watched spitefully, I began to fall in love with your secondary. As a football fan, I could sense something really special in your gigantic corners, and the safeties were great. Watching the defense was a great source of pleasure for me, and I stopped at that moment (though I would never admit it out loud) hating Seattle.

Then this year came. I live in AZ (the Cards are my second favorite team), and I really wanted them to sign Peyton of Flynn, because Kolb is an absolute joke made out of porcelain. Not only did we not get either, you guys signed the second most coveted free agent in the league! I was no idiot, and knew you were just a solid QB and maybe one more receiver away from being contenders. I was upset that the seahawks always managed to screw my team (and second team) out of something good. 

Then you drafted Russel Wilson, which I had no feelings to at all (I'm not a fan of CFB). But, as Flynn struggled, Wilson excelled in the preseason. The cynic in me said, ""I bet they are gonna go ahead and give Flynn the starting job, because they have so much invested already"" and was ready again to hate them for being stupid because of money. But, Carrol did the respectable thing, and started the player who looked better on film, not the one who was more expensive.

He should have won the game against AZ, the receiver dropped the pass in the endzone. Against Green Bay, I wanted so desperately for Aaron Rodgers to lose after getting the worst pass interference call I had ever seen called to go ahead in that game. Russel Wilson (along with Golden Tate, the replacement refs) delivered. I was glad to see GB lose.

Then along came week 6. My by far least favorite team in the NFL is the Patriots (I hate Tom Brady more than any other human currently occupying the world, and that's another story for another time). I was watching game, and you were down by 13, and yet again I was irritated by you guys. Can't you beat the only team I have ever hated more than you? 

Then there it was. Russel Wilson was clutch. Sherman talked shit, and I loved it. You beat the GD patriots, and embarrassed Brady while doing so. 

And here is the confession that I never could have in my wildest nightmares considered possible:

I am a huge fan of the seahawks. I think Wilson should be rookie of the year, and Sherman is the best corner in the league. I genuinely look forward to playing you twice a year for years to come, and I would like to say congratulations on such a great year. I was hoping you would have won the Superbowl this year, and don't hang your heads after losing to the number 1 seed in the playoffs. The future looks very good for you guys

I spend a little bit more time in /r/nfl than I do in this subreddit and lately I have been seeing a lot of hate towards Seahawks fans. This is probably because we have been on an amazing winning streak and dominating other teams in the process. During this time, we have also picked up many new fans. Although we should welcome these new fans, we should also teach them the Seahawks ways. I have seen many flamebait comments that have not represented the team well.

Like /u/nightshiftb said ""Let's at least try not to antagonize or berate - and back up statements with facts and stats.""

Act like we have been here before. Hell. We have been here before. 

We should also be on the look out for troll accounts too. I found the account /u/IspeakForSeahawkFans say ""ALFRED MORRIS IS A BUM! HE DESERVED TO GET STEPPED ON BRO"". This was an obvious troll account. I reported and messaged the mods to help clear our name. 

But for all of this, I don't mean that we should stop representing and taking pride in our Seahawks in r/nfl. Let's just do it the 12th man way!

Also I'd like to apologize for the novel I've written below.
***** 

  I’m a diehard Packers fan from birth and nothing any other team does will change that. I grew up watching Brett Favre play and when he left I started cheering for Aaron Rodgers and I’ve never looked back. That said, I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for the Seahawks. I can’t really explain it but for as long as I can remember you’ve been my #2 team. Maybe it’s because my favorite colors are green and blue or maybe it’s because Seattle seems like as city I’d like to live in some day. Maybe Matt Flynn and Russell Wilson both have ties to Wisconsin and I was especially excited to see how that would turn out this summer. Maybe my choice didn’t need reasoning but the fact remains I’d root for you guys when I got the chance.  
This backstory is what made our meeting this past season so gut wrenching for me. Living in Wisconsin, pretty much everyone is a Packer fan. My friends, my family, my boss - all Packer fans. I was at first livid with the refs after the game, as I hope you can understand. After a day or two I got over it and I then began defending you guys. You were my backup team and I wished it had happened to anyone else but the two of us. As time passed the Pack fans got over it as well and we accepted our loss peacefully. I was happy to be done with it and looked forward to the rest of the season. Then something terrible happened which changed my outlook on a team I’d cheered for since I was a kid.  

*You guys kept winning.*  

  Against a lot of expectations Seattle kept putting together wins and when they did lose they played great. People began to take notice and like many teams that suddenly started getting wins your fan base exploded. Now I’m not blaming any of you for that, God knows in 2010-11 we had our share of bandwagon fans, but at the time, especially considering how close our game was, it really started to get to me.  

  New Seattle fans were the cockiest fans I’d come across and it drove me crazy. I know, I know, it wasn’t you guys but in my mind the entire fan base was compromised. The arrogance of the fans was so disgusting I felt like I couldn’t support the Hawks any longer. Every time someone brought up a crowd at a game there’d be some Seattle fan talking about the “12th Man” and how every other team’s fans couldn’t possibly make as much noise or love their team as much as they did Seattle. Fans wouldn’t even acknowledge the controversy that surrounded our game. I accepted our loss; I just wanted to hear some Seahawk fan admit that it was a close call and a close game.  

  By the playoffs I was sick of hearing it. I was sick of your bandwagon fans and I was sick of them talking like they were the greatest fans to ever watch the game. I was bitter and I started rooting against the team I’d always secretly liked. My initial hope was for us to meet again in the NFC Championship Game and dominate in our “rematch”.  

  When we were eliminated by the 49ers on Saturday I was crushed. On Sunday I didn’t even want to think about football but I found myself tuning in to your match against Atlanta at around halftime and I was surprised at how happy I was to see you guys losing by 20. I had other things to do so I left the room happy and went about my business but when I came back at the very end I saw you were about to score another touchdown and win it. I was captured by the tension and I was jumping around the room cheering against you for that crazy last minute of play. When Atlanta, a team I don’t even like, won I was so pumped. I once again went about my business but I knew I’d come here later to bask in your pain, a pain we now shared.  
  
  I forgot all about football for several hours but when I did remember I came over here to revive myself with your crushed Super Bowl dreams. Instead I found a subreddit full of people slightly bummed about the game but excited about their team! You all were thankful for the awesome season and everyone was looking ahead to next year. I literally felt like the Grinch wondering why you weren’t all crying over your stolen presents. Why were you all singing songs of joy when you should have been crushed your season was ended?  

  That’s when I realized I was the one being a dick. I had no right to judge all you proper fans based on some snide comments from a few jerks. I had no reason to turn on my backup team of 10+ years just because some of the fans were excited about their team. Most of those comments, the ones I interpreted as arrogance were merely passion for a team that really deserves it. My heart grew 3 sizes today. I wanted to tell my story and share my support.  

  You guys had a great season and I think next year will be even better. You have a passionate fan base that’s rightfully proud of their team and that’s nothing to be ashamed of. I’m sorry for having doubted you all and I’ll always root for the Seahawks as long as they’re not playing against the Packers!

I arrived late to meet some friends on the rooftop of Hard Rock and they were waiting in line for drinks. I say hi and turn around to see someone of John's size and bearded awesomeness behind us in line.

""Dude, you look just like John Moffitt.""

""Thats because I am John Moffitt. How many 300 pounders do you know?""

My buddies were all from out of town and had no idea why I was talking to this guy until I brought up Seahawks training camp.

Super funny guy, really nice and down to earth. [I asked him where the Hooter's outfit was](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1796277453/16445_880629474397_8607809_53060730_6522526_n.jpg) which he said its currently in retirement. 

No photos. Didn't want to blow his cover on a nice Seattle afternoon. 

John - If you stumble on this, you're one silly bastard and I love you.

We're top three in the AFC, we've played your whole division and lost to 3 of 4 teams, and your team is by far the hardest we've faced all season.  Russell Wilson plays calm, Lynch runs like the cliche ""beast"" that he is often called, your O-line is solid, your receiver corps is good enough, but your defense...oh your defense.  The only team to really stop the Patriots offense is Seattle.  Rarely does a defense have a big secondary that's actually good.  Teams have tried, but they normally end up with guys like Darnell Bing, Sean Smith or Taylor Mays.  Your team (and you've done it without Browner for a bit) has huge DB's that can run, cover AND hit.  It's absolutely awesome to watch from a distance.  I have no reason to like your team, but I do like them because of the way your squad plays.  Cam Chancellor is like a young Adrian Wilson and your Dline can rush without the blitz (nice rotation you have with Clemons, Bryant, Irving, Jones, Mebane and Branch) .  Your LB's are young but talented, and it's brilliant that you staggered the Sherman and Browner suspensions to ensure that one of them was on the field at all times.  For the record, I don't care about the suspensions.  Great win tonight and good luck in the post season.  As a football fan I'm thrilled to see a team built like yours succeed.  Cheers.

1374624071.0,80,self.Seahawks,1ix63m,"The ""12 &gt; 49"" shirt is now available!! $5 from each shirt goes directly to Bryan Stow and his family.",lemaster_of_disaster,92,12,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/1ix63m/the_12_49_shirt_is_now_available_5_from_each/,"Just got my shirt campaign approved and verified by TeeSpring!

For those who didn't see the original thread, I'm a graphic designer who made a ""12 &gt; 49"" shirt for my fellow Hawks fans.

100% of profits from this sale ($5/shirt) will go to Bryan Stow and his family. Bryan is a San Francisco sports fan who was severely beaten in 2011, at a Dodgers game, simply for supporting his team, and is still on 24/7 medical care. You can read his story [here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/06/25/bryan-stow-uncertain-future-giants-fan/2458329/). The money will be donated to Support4BryanStow.com. I wanted this shirt to promote good sportsmanship and a healthy rivalry, and this seemed like the best way to accomplish that.

The shirt will be sold until August 13th, and will arrive at your door between 8/23 and 8/27, according to TeeSpring. Price for the shirt is $14.85.  The only requirement is that we have to sell 100 of these shirts for this to happen, so feel free to order a bunch of shirts with family, friends, and other Hawks fans - shipping is only an extra 25 cents per additional shirt, so group orders are recommended...maybe pass a sign-up sheet around the office, put a post on Facebook to get a group order together, or buy some kick-ass Christmas gifts at just $15.10 apiece.

If you want to spread the word to other fans via Facebook, you can share [this photo](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=649023078443051&amp;set=a.628122843866408.1073741826.521693227842704&amp;type=1&amp;theater) by simply clicking the ""share"" button.  I'm glad to see such a positive response so far, it says a lot about Hawks fans when they're willing to participate in a fundraiser for a San Francisco fan.

[Link to order the shirt](http://www.teespring.com/gohawks)

Thanks for the support, now it's time to hit the interwebs and spread the word about this fundraiser, so we can hit 100 sales and the Stow family can get a big check.  If we hit the goal, the absolute least they will receive is $500.  Oh, and go Hawks!

**Edit:** I'm not sure where I should or shouldn't x-post this, I want to spread the word about the campaign but obviously don't want to spam a bunch of subreddits.  So if anyone can think of another sub where this would be appropriate, feel free to x-post it.

Brock,


The show has been great lately, I'm sure Seattle will miss Salk though. So, the reason for my email is to see if you'd be willing to have a quick Q &amp; A with the 12th Man on a site called reddit. This Q &amp; A would specifically take place in the Seahawks subreddit. Reddit, if you aren't familiar, is all user submitted content, pulled from various websites. Comedy, literature, sports, it's got a ton of info. Very cool site, check it out if you have a chance.

I posed the question to www.reddit.com/r/seahawks because a lot of your show wrap ups, insight, breakdowns and analysis ends up on there. It's been a great response and you've been dead-on with a lot of your info.

The Q &amp; A on reddit is known as an AMA or Ask Me Anything. Another option is an AMAA or ask me almost anything. Users submit questions and youll be able to reply.  If you decide to take part, you'll work with the moderators and they can help you setup an account and all the details.

If you follow the hypothesis that Russell Wilson struggled early in the season, but learned, then consider the state of the team now:

Russell Wilson looked like an in his prime Drew Brees (who can also run) yesterday. I think he can play like that consistently, as the Falcons defense is no slouch.

Robert Turbin has arrived as a solid backup to Lynch. If the worst happens to our franchise running back, we can still produce at a high level.

Zach Miller is playing as well as any TE this side of Gronk. He can run block and run routes at a high level.

Wilson has brought out Golden Tate's potential. He has a rhythm with Rice. He can win with our current receiving corps.

Our offensive line is now playing at a high level, even without Carpenter. Tom Cable is delivering.

Richard Sherman is the real deal. Locks down like Revis, and gets in your head while he does. I've been daydreaming constantly about watching him lock down receivers solo all year next year, doing his ""crazy"" taunt after each pass thrown his way.

Earl Thomas continues to get even better, which I barely realized was possible. Not only does he cover the whole field, he isn't dropping the picks anymore.

Bobby Wagner is manning the middle LB spot at a high level, and is likely to just keep improving. K.J. Wright was obviously a steal and is a premier strong side OLB.

Our D-Line needs help, but with how we know PCJS can draft, you have to like our chances. Bruce Irvin had a solid rookie season, and Mebane is a very good nose tackle.

Take heart, Hawks. There's every reason to believe next season will be on another level entirely. As we speak, DangeRuss is watching tape.

I understand that. I don't think it was the best call to be honest. But I've seen the Squawks take the business end of more than a few crap calls that critically changed the outcome of a game. So I'll be honest: for once it's nice to see them NOT get the business end of a ref jobbing.

But I'm NOT going to apologize for my Seahawks because it wasn't their fault. And *neither should you*. Nothing they did affected the parity or quality of the refs decision. And on top of that, they did go out on that field and play 60 minutes of tough hard nosed football (especially on defense. holding the Pack to 12?!? Amazing...) 


So I'll take this win. And I won't apologize, but I will be rational about it. So for all you 12th man [edit] *and women* out there who might feel like the world is unfairly weighing down on you: here's some inspirational memage.

A lot of intriguing screenshots have popped up lately, but none have proved definitive evidence for EITHER side. As a die-hard Hawks fan, I was convinced it was an INT, but further evidence proves it's not near as clear-cut.

My suggestion: We settle on the fact that the call was A LOT closer than anyone thinks. Refs make mistakes, and this call was blown out of proportion in an attempt to stick a nail in the coffin of the replacement refs. Nearly every year a team wins on a controversial call, and most of the time, it's forgotten about a month or two later.

I watched Russell Wilson play for three years at NC State, and one year at Wisconsin. You've got a really really good QB, and possibly even a better person starting for you now. I'd say his biggest asset is his remarkable ability to keep the play alive after it should have broken down. I've seen him do this consistently during his college career, as well as in the pre-season. If he can continue to do that, Seahawk nation is in for many years of success.

DT: At first I was kind of disgruntled that we were getting run on early but that changed quikcly Jaye Howard is a beast. He's improved so much and I'm sure he loves being back with Quinn from his Florida days. He penetrated the backfield for some tackles well. Bennett and Hill are a great tandem on the inside for pass rushing. The latter made some really nice moves. He'll definitely be the nose tackle in nickel. McDonald didn't look that great. Not bad, but didn't show much. Which is too bad because I really like him. Jesse Williams was OK. He faced a lot of double teams but got pancaked. He didn't disrupt the offensive line any. 

Leo/SLB: Morgan really put good pressure. Schofield was also good during nickel. He got a few touches on rivers earlier, but Rivers knows to get rid of the ball. Mayowa might make this team if he keeps it up. 2 sacks? Nice (Randy/South Park police chief voice). 

LB: Allen Bradford could start for half of the teams. Loutleilei proved he should make the team as well. They are excellent compliments to B-Wagz and KJ. Smith seemed solid from the SLB spot. He covers fairly good as well against TEs which is huge for that spot. 

Secondary Depth: Holy shit. Next.

Oh and Maragos sure is sure handed, blue collar kind of guy (Remember that one RRR episode?)

OLine: I admittedly didn't notice much other than Rishaw seems like he needs some work. Jeanpierre is a good center but made a few mental errors. Alvin Bailey is a starter quality tackle. Jared Smith and Person were OK as well. Moffitt and Sweezy were solid. The depth at RT is not. 

QB: Russell looked so poised and above the entire Charger defense. 

TJack looks like a great back up. And I'm stoked that he's on the team. You can tell he made a lot of friends here with how the sideline congratulated him. 

WR: Stephen Williams might make the team by proving that he's long ball threat. I didn't see much from Walters or Swain. Kearse is the real deal. He's got the number 4 spot locked up. Ashford and another guy whose name escapes caught the ball. Neat. 

KR/PR: We've got a lot of options. Thurmond III, Ashford?, Blackmon all showed that they can return the ball well. No worry there. And we still have Tate and Walters challenging. We didn't really get to see Michael return it as he had to kneel every time. 

TEs: Willson is a total steal. He can *really* stretch LBs. If Wilson ever catches the defense in man, send Double Hockey Sticks to the endzone. I wish he made the pass over the middle from Russ though. Helfet made a nice catch. He seems to run nice routes but he had that one bad drop. Konz was only in for pass and run blocking which he did well if you ask me but nothing to stand out. I didn't see Lintz out there. 

RB: Coleman was an OK lead blocker but a great pass protector. Also a good receiving threat like Mike Rob. Michael is the shit and half. He made really good cuts and then exploded and shrugged off loose arms trying to tackle him. He's a one cut and book it type of back. He's no beast mode, but you got to really square him up to take him down unless you trip him. He runs well with guys on his ass and around him like Beast though. Ware was OK. He had the one rush TD which was neato. 

I think that's it. I'm stoked. That was awesome. What did yall see?

1357691305.0,61,self.Seahawks,167t1z,Seahawks vs Falcons Predictions and Analysis,goodguyatheart,79,18,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/167t1z/seahawks_vs_falcons_predictions_and_analysis/,"Last week I made my 10 (which turned out to be 20) keys to the Seahawks winning. I also made an on-record prediction of 28-14, not far off. You guys seemed to like that, so here's my prediction and analysis for Sunday. If you like it again, I'd be willing to start doing some kind of weekly column here. Thanks again.



I've been looking at the matchups, studied the different factors, and have come to a decision.



Optimistically, 30-20 Seahawks.

Realistically (my actual pick), 27-21 Seahawks.

Pessimistically, 24-21 Falcons.



Thought process behind those predictions:


Atlanta has the 6th rated pass offense. They have 3 players with over 70 receptions and almost 1,000 yards each. I am talking, of course, about Roddy White, Julio Jones, and Tony Gonzalez. Now while the corners Browner and Sherman are fantastic, they have tough tasks. I see one of those two outside receivers having a game, ~80-90 yards and a TD. The X-Factor will be Gonzalez. We really have nobody to match up well against him. None of our linebackers, however good they are, are going to be able to stop him. Hell, he might even have 2 TDs Sunday. At least one for sure I say. Their run offense is terrible and will be as usual. But if their pass offense is on and Matt Ryan is cold blooded, then things will be problematic. The secondary needs to have the game of their lives. But as we've seen, in big games, they come up big. Problem is our pass rush. Without Chris Clemons, things are surely worse. Bruce Irvin is not as good. He does have incredible speed that brought him 8 sacks this season including a 9th on Sunday, but he's a notch down. And he is bad against the run, very bad. Which is fine since the Falcons don't run much anyway. I think Bruce is solid enough to get a sack and get a little pressure on Ryan, but remember their offensive line is good too. I figure this game will come down to how well we can cover in the back end. If it's good, Ryan is forced to wait and we get coverage sacks, pressures, and throw-aways. If it isn't good and they find ways to get open, we get burned and lose. That's on that side of the ball.

Now let's look at the Seahawks offense where things are more rosey. The Falcons are 23rd against the pass and 21st against the run, both in yards against. So yea, their defense is easily beatable. Furthermore, look what they've done against zone-read teams like the Seahawks. In 2 games against Carolina, the Falcons eeked out a 30-28 win with a game-winning field goal in the final seconds and lost 30-20 in the second meeting. Cam Newton and the Panther running backs accumulated for 199 rushing yards in the first game and 195 in the second. Newton alone got 86 yards in the first and 116 in the second, scoring a touchdown in each game. Bottom line, Atlanta is not good against mobile quarterbacks using the zone-read like Seattle does. This means Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch should have a huge day on the ground using that read. While Atlanta's defense, talent wise, is better than the Redskins...and is faster too...the Seahawks run offense making a difference will open up the pass as well where Russell Wilson is making no mistakes. In his last 9 games, Wilson has 2 interceptions to 17 touchdowns. If that doesn't make you lick your chops, let me place this juicy sir-loin in front of you. In their last 4 games the Falcons are 2-2, giving up an average of over 128 yards per game. And one of those teams was the Detroit Lions who never run the football. In total this season, the Falcons give up an average of over 123 on the ground, ranking 23rd as I stated before. Again, our rushing attack should succeed and open up for a good, but not great, passing day for Wilson. Which is why I don't think we put up any less than 21 points. And on another note, we signed kicker Ryan Longwell who has kicked with the Vikings in domes before and he should be a great replacement to Hauschka. No issue there.

Ultimately this game comes down to the defense. If we can cover well in the secondary, we win. If Ryan is hot and he finds open targets, we lose. As always, GO SEAHAWKS.",,False,self,t5_2ryle,False,,,True,t3_167t1z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/167t1z/seahawks_vs_falcons_predictions_and_analysis/,

Are we still interested in doing this?

I'm a huge fan of how [/r/CFB organized their own brick-buying fund](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1ic70j/the_rcfb_college_football_hof_legacy_bricks_fund/), so I'm going to steal a lot of ideas from them about how to organize this.

[Crowdtilt Link](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/rseahawks-levi-stadium-brick-fund)

**And we're tilted!**
**The Crowdtilt is set to end at 8/5/2013 at noon EST. If it needs to be extended, I will do so.**
__________________

**Background:**

* The 49er's new stadium, Levi Stadium, is [selling off bricks on their FanWalk](http://levisstadiumfanwalk.com/). 
* There are three differently sized bricks available for purchase: 8x8 with 4 lines of text, 8x8 with 6 lines of text, and 4x8 with 3 lines of text.
* Each line can hold up to 15 characters, only alphanumeric characters and punctuation allowed
* Everything will be capitalized, centered, etc
* All inscriptions are vetted first. That means nothing derogatory, hateful, etc.
* The prices include a replica brick, that'll be shipped 8-12 weeks afterwards.
* The bricks are selling as first-come, first-serve. No mention of the number of bricks available, but the website does say that the bricks will be lain by the first home game played at the new stadium. No idea if this is preseason or regular season, but we've got a timer on this.


**Ground Rules**


*heavily stolen from /u/Honestly_ 's awesome post as linked to above*

Before I get into anything about sending money, I think it's helpful to have the basic rules so no one is later disappointed and we can all be on the same page:

* Any message we pick needs to be approved by the Stadium, so know ahead of time that we won't be able to say anything too crazy--but everyone gets to nominate ideas and vote on the final message (details below).

* There won't be room to put usernames on the brick, it will be a general message from /r/Seahawks--no matter what message is chosen, it will be only from /r/Seahawks.

* People who donate will get to have ultimate say on what we write on the brick (suggestions welcome from everyone, including non-donors). I also think it'd be most fair to ship the replica brick to the highest contributing donor, but I'd welcome your feedback in that regard. The display case is $55 extra through the Levi Stadium site.

* To be fair to those who donate more, in determining what the Brick's message will be, each donor will be given one vote per $1 they donate. The message will be determined by majority of donor votes (50%+1). Yes, theoretically someone could just donate a ton of money and determine what we say--so long as the message isn't something that will clearly be rejected and only credits /r/Seahawks. **For people who do not have Reddit accounts and don't plan on getting one--be sure to let me know through Crowdtilt so I can get your opinion when we're voting for the insrciption.**

* The gold non-premium bricks are $195, $345, and $395. The red premium bricks are $265, $495, $545. If we go over a particular amount, but fall short of another brick, the extra funds will be donated to the whoever the majority of donors (not donor-votes) want, be it a charity, a player's foundation, etc. This also means that instead of a more expensive brick, we could potentially buy more than one brick. We don't get to choose where these bricks go, but having a few random /r/Seahawks bricks sprinkled throughout the FanWalk is its own reward. This decision will ultimately be put to a donor-votes vote.

* The funds will initially go to CrowdTilt, which will then place them in my bank account, and I will donate those funds to the HOF. I will do my damnedest to be transparent about where the funds are and how much we have. You have my track record in /r/CharitableBets to go off of, but if you're uncomfortable with that still, I have no problem with letting /u/SGMD1 take over this fundraising part. I'm also fine open to any other suggestions to prove this transparency.

* CrowdTilt allows for a maximum donation period of 30 days, so I am placing that as the limit--if we see a reason, I can start another donation period afterward.


**Payment Selection**


* CrowdTilt requires a minimum target donation, so I set the amount for a single gold brick ($195). Crowdtilt also charges a 2.5% donor fee, so please keep that in mind when we get a final figure. We can go as far beyond that as we want. As I mentioned above, we can donate multiple bricks. Again, Crowdtilt will only charge your credit card if we pass the minimum donation amount, so if we don't raise enough for even the cheapest brick, no worries, you didn't lose any money.


**How to Donate (Two-Step Process)**


If you want to donate to our /r/Seahawks Levi Stadium Brick Fund please use the following two steps:

* Go to our CrowdTilt page and make a donation.

* Since CrowdTilt will only show me your real names, **please, please message me separately with your name and donation amount so I will know which reddit user name to credit here!** (or in the top post, depending on what I'm allowed to edit)(you can message me via reddit or via CrowdTilt; you will get confirmation from me via Reddit message) I will update this post with just the reddit usernames of those who've successfully donated, along with the amount they donated. I will respect requests for anonymity, and only list those dollar amounts to 'anonymous' (or, as someone requested: 'anonymous' + flair).

I'll do my best to keep the list of donors and amounts updated at least once a day, but please be patient. While I don't foresee any hang-ups, you never know. If you don't see yourself listed after paying, or you have other concerns, please contact me via reddit message and I will do my best to keep you in the loop.

I'm happy to answer questions in this thread or via message.

* 1 of 2 ""experts"" to pick us against the Patriots.
* 1 of 3 to pick us against the Packers.
* 1 of 3 to pick us against the Cowboys.
* Picked us against the Saints in the playoff game two years ago and got a lot of flack for it.


And now he's the only one to pick us against the Niners.



Love you too Keyshawn.
