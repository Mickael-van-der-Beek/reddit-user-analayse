(Shoutout to Gretchen!)

I'm looking for someone to carpool to work with (and by carpool I mean you drive and I pay in for gas obviously).

I live in La Mesa (right off the freeway) and my work is moving to Sorento Valley (next door to Qualcomm and Cisco) I work M-F. Anytime around 9-5 (+/- an hour)  - it's a bitch by public transit but I have no choice because the man took my license away - apparently the government does not like legally blind people operating motor vehicles... go figure.


I Would MUCH rather spend the time BS'ing with a fellow Redditor about the coming singularity, Steve Job's secret evil plans, marginal tax rates... and funny pictures of cats.

Pleae PM me if it's been your life-long wish to carpool with a blind guy - or at least save a few bucks on gas.

Also,  if you're not in La Mesa but near a trolley stop I can always meet you there too...

Surely you've already seen it on the front page. But, if you don't already know, the infrastructure will be constructed on-demand only. That means enough people have to sign up before September 9th. So if you're even remotely interested, sign-up and get as many people on board as possible. I'm sure you're all familiar with Cox and AT&amp;T's crappy service. And surely this will give them a run for their money.

Gets me to where I need to go. I bid him adieu and run inside. About 20 minutes later, it hits me. Where the hell is my phone. Ordinary circumstances, losing a phone is a royal PITA, but on the job in a city that is not home, losing a phone is a CRISIS.

I reach into my pocket, and find this with the receipt for the ride:

http://i.imgur.com/HNNSW.jpg

I called him on an associate's phone, he and his current fare found the phone in the back seat. He told me he would finish his current fare and come back to me.

He came back to where I was about forty minutes later, parked and waited for me on the street till we could connect, and then refused all attempts of mine to reward him with $.

Thank you, Doug the Cabbie. You are an awesome, righteous human being.

tldr; lost phone while working in SD. awesome cabbie brought it back to me personally, turned down reward. good humans rock.

Her flowers last a lot longer than store-bought bouquets and if you ask her to make something specific, she'll put a lot of care into creating something special. You can go in her walk-in cooler and pick out flowers for her to use when making a custom bouquet.

He really sucks at advertising, and just doesn't know how to go about in exposing it. Since no one knows about it, he has been feeling really depressed lately.
So I advised him to give away free small shave ice on June 16 between 2pm and and 6pm. If you guys aee interested its on 4206 convoy st. 
He does have other promotion like buy one get one half off. 

Edit: thank you so much, I asked him if he was willing to give reddit a deal, he said he can offer you guys a scoop of ice cream with your shave ice for free if you say reddit. He does the same thing with students if they bring their id.

I forgot my valet key (no electronics on it) when I went surfing in oceanside yesterday so I hid my normal key in a slot on my car that I had used before I realized I should stop doing that. It's the kind of awkward slot in a car where someone has to know where it is in order to find it - well they must have watched me put it there because I came back and my car was gone.

This also happened to another person I know when he was surfing a couple days ago. 

SO PLEASE - don't let these guys get away with this, bring a non-electronic key and stash it in your wetsuit or bordshorts in the appropriate spot and not by your car. And if you forget it, just figure out some sort of way to not store the key by your car or go back home and get it! Not worth it if your car gets stolen.

* $25 Taxi from the border to Rosarito (two people) **EDIT** Mexicoach takes you from San Ysidro to the Rosarito Beach Hotel for $26 roundtrip (min. 5 people). Check website and I would call first. 

* Hotels with Ocean views $45-$79 per night.

**Beach Activities**
* You can walk to the beach from any hotel, take your towel and you can sit at any of the ""Palapas"" on the beach (order a beer).  You'll have about 5 different waiters that will bring you $1.25 Mexican Beer and $3 Tequila (7 sec pour) shots. They can also bring you food and Tapas. 

* Two regulation beach volleyball courts were just sitting there unused, just steppes away from one of 3 little bars right on the beach.

* Horseback riding. (On the beach)
* ATV rentals (On the beach)
* Once the sun went down the waiter guys offered to bring wood down to us so we had a bond-fire.
* Nightlife is pretty obvious (Papas &amp; Beer) not my cup of tea, but it's nice to go in the day (described above).

* Taxi to Puerto Nuevo (New Port Lobser) village should not cost you more than about $8-$10 each way.  You need to shop around as some of the nicer yellow cabs tried to charge us $25. Just ask how much before you get in and say no thanks and they'll lower the price or just try another cab.  The white ones that were more rickety were honest and gave us local prices.

* Rosarito Beach Hotel - NO! Unless you want to feel like you woke up in Rancho Santa Fe.  Very rich and older people who treated the staff like shit.

* Hotel Festival worked for me, right next door to the RBH, big rooms with double beds, high rise and great view. $79/ night.

* Street tacos are the way to go. Right across the street from Hotel Festival and you're looking at about $1.50/ taco.

I can't think of anything else but I thought all in all a very cool, cheap vacation that didn't involve air travel and I was back at my house in a couple of hours.  The tourist are 99% Mexican families and mind their own business but like to party so you don't get that whole ""Disneyland"" vibe.  The waiters at the beach who also work for Papas and Beer which pretty much runs the entire block from the water to the street are there to take your drinks and provide security. They have this ""don't kill the golden goose"" mentality.

1374857214.0,82,self.sandiego,1j3tuj,Advice for any san diegan with a bike.,Strumtralescent,89,7,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1j3tuj/advice_for_any_san_diegan_with_a_bike/,"Hundreds of bikes get stolen every day in San Diego.  In fact 2 friends of mine had bikes stolen on separate occasions this week. Theft is a serious problem in every neighborhood of our fine city.  By following these steps, I have gotten a stolen bike, a stolen guitar and a friends bike back.  Here are a few steps to keep your bike safe or to get it back in the event that some scumbag steals it:

1. Prepare:  Write down your bikes serial number and take a photo of the bike/ serial.  This can usually be found under the bottom bracket.  Save the serial number.  Without this, no one will help you legally and safely.

2. Prevent:  Always use a U-lock or a lock that cannot easily be cut with bolt cutters.  Many heavy chain locks can be easily cut.  Lock all wheels and remove your seat if it can be easily removed.  Obviously lock it to a permanent object preferably in a well lit area.

3. Report: If by chance your bike gets lifted, file a police report immediately.  No need to lie about anything here, they will ask if it was locked up and if you have a serial #.  If you don't have the serial number you are S.O.L.

4. The Search:  There are a few common places where stolen places end up.  The obvious one is Craigslist.  Either search constantly or use a notification service like a clist app to monitor keywords associated with your ride.  alternatively post a WTB.  it's surprising how stupid some thieves are.  Maybe smart enough not to post but, I have had a bike thief text me a photo of my bike 1 day after it was stolen.
Kobe's: as was mentioned earlier today, the bike guys at kobe's have a ton of stolen stuff and sell in bulk.   I didn't say everything is stolen so don't get worked up, but I have retrieved stolen bikes from there as well.  Whether they are aware they are stolen or not, facts are facts, so if your associated with kobe's don't come crying to me.
Pawn shops: Bikes that go through pawn shops must pass through police reports so if you filed one then it should get picked up.  This normally takes a little while so you can check back often.
Get creative: every area has it's own places so think of any local place that may be involved with used bikes, someone may have tried to sell it and been denied or otherwise.  Most used bike shops in SD are honest from my experience.

5. The retrieval: Since you have the serial number, a photo and found your bike, the next step is getting it back safely.  Contact the cops.  set up a meeting to buy your ride back and let the police know that it is set up.   Double check that they are on there way 15-30 minutes beforehand.  They can have a lot to do on a given night.  they can help you through the rest of the way.  Afterwards you can choose to press charges or allow the police to ""investigate"" possession of stolen property.

Don't try to steal it back, fight for it, or handle it without police.  Honestly they are actually going to help you here and your bike is not worth your life or a hospital visit.  Keep in mind this person is a bike thief and is very low on the scale of morality so don't get involved without authorities.  Hopefully SD can increase the number of reports because the majority of these thefts go un reported and therefore the PD doesn't understand how huge the problem of Bike theft is in SD.

On September 8th of 2011, San Diego experienced a city-wide loss of power. While strange, awkward, and inconvenient, I think it created an interesting and calm atmosphere. Most people I know visited friends/neighbors/family around the county when they normally wouldn't. Also everyone was forced to check necessary disaster supplies like flashlights, candles, water, and food.

Well this year September 8th falls on a Saturday. What if we just all decided to go lights-out that Saturday evening? I don't mean shutting off all power, but only power to lights that are not needed for safety or traffic reasons. For example, restaurants would operate with candles just for that night, (though for obvious reasons the restaurant's kitchen would have light).

Obviously I'm not advocating total darkness as that could be dangerous. But we could organize areas where powered lights are turned off and everyone is required to bring their own flashlight. 

With such a day it could be possible to get people to be more prepared for a similar disaster while at the same time having fun. Because of the events for that day, people would at least check for working flashlights and/or matches and candles. With more awareness, people would at least be reminded to check their supplies for adequate preparation in a similar disaster.

Although I have seen him have several seizures over the course of our friendship, it is still a harrowing experience to say the least.  I did the same thing that I had rehearsed since we were kids, I waited a few minutes, and when he didn't stop seizing I called 911.  When the ambulance arrived the EMT and paramedic took stock of what was going on.  My friend had stopped seizing, but was very confused about what had happened (common for him after a seizure.)  After talking with him they decided to take him to the hospital and told me that I could ride along, and I decided to do so.  On the way to the hospital the EMT that was driving started talking with me about school, San Diego, rock climbing, and other random topics.  It was wonderful.  She was so calm and cool in a very crazy situation.  She had a way of putting me at ease and dissipating some of the stress of the whole ordeal.  When we got to the hospital the ambulance left again almost immediately.  I never even got a chance to get that EMT's name.  However, if in the future you find yourself driving around Mira Mesa in an ambulance with a cute blonde who has a way of making everything seem alright, tell her thanks for me.

During some of my ride (especially East San Diego and La Mesa), there are bike lanes, and everything is cool between bicyclists and drivers. During the rest of my ride (looking at you, El Cajon) I get cut off, buzzed, yelled/cussed at constantly after the bike lane disappears and I ride in the middle of one of the traffic lanes. Most people are very frustrated by this, and yell at me to ""Get on the fucking sidewalk!""

The thing is, in El Cajon, San Diego, and La Mesa, it is illegal for a bike to be on the sidewalk.  If there is no bike lane, then bicyclists are required to behave exactly as a car, including using stop signs and turning lanes.

But lately, I've seen people starting to park on Navajo Rd, in the bike lane. It happens every Saturday and Sunday. And the city is **majorly ticketing.**  It's so sad to see 15-20 cars or more each day with tickets.  There are signs posted that say No Parking, but they're few and far between, imo.  And especially once people start parking there, it's hard for someone not familiar with the area who's just arriving to know that it's a bike lane.

I thought after so many weekends with so many tickets, SD would catch on, but it's not. It's really so hard to watch... ugh.

I didn't know what to expect or how it was going to be.



After this weekend I just want to say that San Diego is the friendliest place I have ever gone to in my life.



When I was on the train to go eat or exploring, people would always make small-talk with me and they were extremely friendly. Then when I was asking for help everyone was extremely nice. A cop even started talking to me at one point, and I was prepared to be defensive because I've never had good luck with cops, but instead he just asked me about Comic Con and if I had been enjoying myself.


The public transportation was AMAZING. I could get anywhere I wanted with ease. I never felt like I needed/wanted a car. And everything was extremely organized and efficient.


At Comic Con people were super helpful and, amazingly, everything was incredibly organized. I never felt there was much disorder or chaos. Trust me, if we had anything close to CC in PR, the building would be burning by the end of the day.


I went to visit an old friend of mine at UCSD and was amazed by the size. And  again, everyone I met was just so nice and helpful!! 


This whole weekend has been an amazing and unforgettable experience for me. And I just wanna say this: Don't change.

I guess I volunteered to organize the San Diego Reddit Meetup 2012.  With less than a month to go I realized I had better start planning something...

I originally thought that the best idea would be to have a BBQ at a park or something, and since you can drink at Balboa Park I thought that would be the best place. [Balboa Park Rules](http://www.balboapark.org/visit/rules)

Several people have suggested on the [SD Meetup](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/sd-global-reddit-meetup/) site that we hold it at a State Beach.  There are several problems with this, firstly you cannot have alcohol on state beaches, and secondly I am fairly certain we will run in to a problem with the amount of people we are planning on having attend.

As long as we don't have more than 75 people we will not run in to any problems at Balboa Park, and as long as you're willing to walk a little there shouldn't be any problems with parking.  If we do end up having more than 75 people I will look in to getting a permit, but right now we're holding steady at about 50.

If you're planning on attending I would love to get an idea of what everyone is planning on bringing.  Please send me a PM with an idea so I can get a list going.  Also, I recommend joining the [SD Redditors Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/groups/sdredditors/) by clicking the link.

Thank you all, hope to see everyone there!

Near the sliding door entrance one of the staff members was bent over as he was frantically trying to look under a taped poster towards the outside, a walkie-talkie was in his hand. I don't know why he didn't just step outside the glass doors to look out. 

About 100 of us congregated outside the library, asking each other what the fuck was going on. When a girl asked the staff member he yelled out, ""GET AWAY FROM THE BUILDING. GO!"" So we headed to our cars, we counted 3 cop cars parked near the library. 

On our way to our cars I noticed something funny, the administrative building looked normal: no panicking, students sitting around. So my friend and I stepped inside to find out what was going on. The staff were clueless and didn't know what the hell we were talking about. 

Does anyone know what happened today at Mesa? 

**Update**- a comment from the [SD Mesa College facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/SanDiegoMesaCollege)

&gt;What was up with the library at 5:30 today? They kicked everyone out as if something was a big enough of a threat to shut down the library and not the rest of the school... kind of odd. The best answer they could give everyone is that ""there is a problem"" You don't say?. I hate it when people don't inform others of the situation.

I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the different areas and fun things to do but want to make sure I haven't missed anything crucial! Some of the highlights so far include:

* The San Diego Zoo (I have a membership)
* Balboa Park (The museums and gardens) 
* Disneyland (I know it's not San Diego, but it's close enough for a day trip)
* The Little Italy Farmer's Market (Lived down the street for a bit and went frequently)
* Comic-Con (I've been twice and plan to go again this year)
* Padres Games (I've been to a handful)
* Downtown (Gaslamp, East Village, Little Italy)
* Northpark/Southpark/Hillcrest/Mission Hills (Great places to eat, drink, and shop)
* 30th on 30th
* The craft breweries (Stone, Green Flash, Ballast Point, as well as some of the smaller pop-up ones like Rough Draft / Wet 'N  Reckless)
* The Del Mar Fair Grounds (The Del Mar Fair, Horse Races, Concerts)
* SDSU (Summer Concert Series, Even took a class)
* La Jolla (The Cove and Town)
* The Cedros Design District in Solana Beach (And the Drive from there to Carlsbad)
* The Rock 'N' Roll Marathon (Ran it twice)

Things that I'm interested in include:

* Outdoor activities (hiking, backpacking, etc.)
* Community events that are happening between now and November
* Awesome small business districts that I may have missed
* Incredible places to eat
* Beautiful views
* Anything in the beach communities (I haven't spent a lot of time in Mission Bay, OB, PB, or Point Loma)
* Anything else that comes to mind as a must do!

**TL;LR** What do you take people to do when they visit? What are some things you can get / do in San Diego that you can't get / do anywhere else? What is something that's an essential part of your ""San Diego Experience.""

I did three tours of duty in Iraq and shit like this pisses me off to no extent. This family moved to the U.S. in 1996. Her husband helped to train American troops by instructing them on proper customs and courtesies of the Iraqi people. He helped the same people who ""invaded"" his home country because he knew what their real mission was.

I'm not going to get into politics here and I don't give a shit about what you think about the invasion. But if you ask me why *I* was over there, it gets much more personal than WMDs or whatever. Walking around in the outskirts of Ramadi or the city of Fallujah, we would have locals drop to their knees in appreciation for our presence. There were law-abiding citizens who would genuinely invite us into their homes for tea. They would insist on providing us with favors that we never asked for.

Unfortunately, Iraq is still a very volatile place to live. Those who are fortunate enough, pack their belongings and head somewhere for a better lifestyle.

That lifestyle happened to be the United States for Mrs. Alawadi and her family. For nearly two decades, they have called this land ""home"". Immigration may be a rising problem, but you have to admit it is rather flattering. The American Dream is still alive.

For, y'know, posterity's sake.

So I caught myself a ride down to OB with two random redditors who were completely awesome (a theme I would find the night repeating ad infinitum). We found the awesome pirate flag and were surprised to see only two people at the pit, as it was 6:15. We walked up and said ""hey, SD redditors!"" The couple looked at us confusedly. ""Um, isn't this the reddit meet up?""

The chick, who will henceforth be known as Bitchface McSkank said to us, ""Oh, you mean the flag? **Yeah, the guys that were here said it was cancelled because nobody showed up...**""

Disbelievingly, I said ""Are you sure? Cuz they were staking out the pit since noon and I really doubt they'd leave, especially since there's going to be 60+ people coming to this.""

Bitchface: ""Yeah, and we talked to the lifeguard and he said that you can't hold a spot, so we took it.""

We were really confused and sort of wtf-ing, and at that point more redditors started showing up from every direction, so when she asked us to move the flag to avoid more confusion we were sort of like ""Okay...I guess..."" and moved it over to the grass to at least try to gather people over there.

So then the three guys who had been holding down the pit all day, who had only left to get themselves some food (which Bitchface straight out lied to us about) come over wondering wtf we're doing. We explain to them the haps and the guy who set it up went over to tell Bitchface to shove the situation up her ass and give us our pit back, but she wouldn't budge. At this point we started considering our options:

* Find another pit (tried, they were all taken)

* Wait for about 20 more redditors to show up and just charge the pit and take it over, or possibly sit in it,

* Sit in a circle around the pit, holding hands, singing the Pokemon theme song until they left,

* Mandatory sex party,

* Go somewhere else (fuck that!),

* Make friends with another group and ask to share their pit (no one wanted to share).

* Hope that this bitch is actually trollin' us good and about to go ""J/K COME JOIN US MY INTERNET BRETHREN""

We were debating all this as more and more redditors show up (we learned that you can spot a redditor easily across a vast stretch of lawn, we are all so obvious). After we'd been there for about half an hour, Bitchface walks by and passive-aggressively yells ""You guys are obviously confused so I can go get the lifeguard if you need things cleared up"" in her best Paris-Hilton-I-own-your-ass impression. The guys who set the whole thing up are like ""Fuck that! WE'RE going to talk to the lifeguard!"" so they head to the station.

A while later they came back to report that the first lifeguard was sympathetic to our situation, as he'd seen them at the pit earlier that day, but the higher-up lifeguard sided with Bitchface because she apparently pulled the ""these manly men were threatening me telling me they had 60 people and were going to RAPE ME"" sort of deal so no go. At this point we were all pretty pissed and I'm sure half the group was planning the rage comic of the situation in their heads.


LUCKILY, it was then that Eric and his friends appeared! These two guys and a chick walked right up to our group and started talking to us, being very friendly. It took us a minute for us to realize that they had no idea what Reddit was and were just trying to figure out why a bunch of nerdy people were standing awkwardly on the beach by a pirate flag. We explained to them about the meet-up and what had happened, and Eric goes, ""Well, if you guys want, that's my house right over there! *points to fucking rad yellow house right on the beach* You guys can totally come over and party, I have a firepit!""

It took us a minute to actually believe him because the whole thing was just too awesome to comprehend, but when we realized he was serious, I called for an ""up vote"" and everybody gave thumbs up (lol) so we headed the fuck over there! The rest is history: a shit ton more people came and went, some amazing people went on several beer runs (because as we were no longer technically on the beach, drinking was now kosher under SD law, sort of!), there were pickles and s'mores, and everyone was fucking rad and really friendly. I went into squirrel-on-speed socializing mode and flipped from group to group the whole night and just generally had a blast. 

SUCCESS!!! (oh, and did I mention? Hypothesis confirmed: San Diegans are in general ridiculously attractive, *especially* SD redditors)

TL;DR: YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME

I know a lot of people here didn't like the Mikey Show due to the incessant Christian theme but there appears to be a pretty big uproar from listeners to the show. 

It seems the crew sans Mikey is still at the station. I don't believe they have released an ""official"" statement but on the front page you can see it says Mikey is no longer with the FM 94.9 morning show. (http://www.fm949sd.com/)

So, uh, I guess it would be a good idea to head over to their facebook page and leave some input if you feel strongly upon this issue. 

http://www.facebook.com/fm949sd

I'm not sure what I think. I felt it was really odd to have the motto ""About the music"" then have a totally conservative guy sit there having a morning talk show BUT the cast member Jay often redeemed the show for me with completely inappropriate perverted humor akin to internet nonsense. Mixed feelings, but at least now hopefully 91x will stop with their obnoxious ""we play music in the morning not talk LOL"" circlejerk campaign.

We are opening the first Paleo &amp; Primal friendly fast food truck in San Diego, CA this summer 2012.  Our menu consists of everyday items like burgers, fish tacos, poutine...etc, but all of our ingredients are local, pastured, unprocessed and free of preservatives, gluten free, soy free...and more

It IS possible to eat healthy fast food, and it starts here, in our beautiful city!

We started a KickStarter 3 weeks ago with hopes to raise extra funding for our truck wrap and for some specific commercial appliances we need.  We are at 66% of our goal, with 10 days left.  

Even if you aren't on the diet, don't watch what you eat, don't care about how you eat, I guarantee that most of the foods on our menu will still satisfy you.

Special Deal we are running this week...If you live in San Diego area and pledge $25, you get the normal rewards on kickstarter plus a 3 pack of our homemade Turkey Meatloaf Muffins with Primal Ketchup Icing.  If you pledge  $50, you get the normal rewards + 6pk of muffins....AND we will DELIVER them to you THIS WEEK!!!!!

ALSO - - Anything helps! There are $2 and $5 pledges that will still get you a pretty sweet sticker if you come to the truck! :)

We understand times are tough for everyone, so, we completely understand a lot of you may not want to or have means to pledge.  If that is the case, we still appreciate your time and would really appreciate it if you could post our link on your FB or twitter or to even 1 person you may know that eats healthy or does CrossFit.

For those who wish to receive the box he is holding you must complete these steps

1) be the FIRST to tell the penguin ""I am here for the reddit box"" 
2) any words spoken to the penguin after this point will result in loss of the box
3) the penguin will then motion you to sit with him. you will sit and take a picture with your camera, either holding it, setting a timer or having your friend take it for you. again no words will be spoken or you will lose the box.
4) once picture is taken you will be handed a box and the penguin will leave you.
5) go home and post the pic to reddit
6) inside the box you will find further instructions. follow those directions. keep the contents of this box a secret, let no other redditors know its secret. The secret will be revealed in time.

(You can look at my other posts for more details). We are looking for a room, a converted garage, a granny flat...just a space where we can lay our heads while we get on our feet. We have little money, so I can't pay a lot per month, but we don't need anything fancy. Just some place safe, and close to the bus/trolley lines so she can get to school. 

I have many years experience with everything from managing correspondence to travel planning to bookkeeping to putting together press packets. In addition to raising my own, I've cared for children since I was 12. I've also had dogs my entire life, starting with a German Shepard who was born the same day I was. I'd be happy to assist in any of these areas in place of part of the rent to make up for what I don't have in cash. 

About us: We're both artists, both very creative. Non-judgmental, laid back. Have no problem getting along with most anyone, really. My daughter goes to a creative arts school. We enjoy movies and a wide variety of music genres. I am working towards going back to school once we get established somewhere. 

If anyone here has a place, or knows someone who does, I would really appreciate your help. It's very humbling being in this position, but I am hoping someone out there can be of assistance. I've always tried to do what I could to help others, and when I'm able, will definitely pay it forward. 

ETA: I should mention that her school is off the 54, between the 125 and the 805, so something between there and La Mesa, SDSU area, North Park, etc would be ideal.

This upcoming Saturday (27th) and Tuesday (30th), they are showing Fight Club.  They managed to get a 35mm print for it, so they are very excited.

She's never been one to completely disappear like this. I last physically saw her in April. And I last had any communication with her at all in August- when she sent me a text message with a picture of a rash she had (and I'm certain it was in fact her). She also mentioned being really depressed and needing to see a doctor, but she didn't have insurance or the means to do so. I told her I would give her money to see an urgent care doctor for her rash, but she refused. Then I told her that I wanted to hear from her the following day so she could tell me how it went at urgent care. I tried getting into contact with her the next day to find out if she did in fact go to urgent care for her rash, but I got no response. 

I have gotten no response since, and now her phone has been disconnected. She hasn't been on Facebook or MySpace or anything else for that matter. She's an adult, she's 26; originally from Corona, CA. She first left home in February, but she kept in weekly contact with me via text message. She wouldn't tell me exactly where she was living, but she made reference to the San Diego, CA area. She just told me that she was staying with a friend. Since then, I'm not sure if she has moved or even if she has a place to stay or if she has a job. She graduated from a 6 week nursing course in January (but I'm not sure of what her certification was). I have contacted ALL of her friends that she may have talked to, but nobody has heard anything at all in over 2 months. Her little 5 year old daughter hasn't seen her mom in months. I filed a police report, and she IS in the missing persons database, but I just want to know that she's okay and I was hoping I could ask everyone to just take one moment to look at her photos. My sister and I haven't been ""close"" (meaning 'best friend' type relationship) since we were kids, but we've always checked in with each other to shoot the shit and make sure the other is doing alright. I have scoured the internets looking for her. I know that sometimes people do this kind of thing because they feel it's what they need. But, why did she all of a sudden cease all contact 2 months ago..? I just want to know that she's okay; that she's alive; that she's not in danger. Please reddit, this isn't a bullshit request; I just want to know that my sis is okay.

tl;dr My 26 year old sister disappeared off of the face of the planet. Do you recognize her? Please tell me that she's okay.



Edit: For those that would be more comfortable speaking to a police officer, here is the business card with the case number that I was given at the time I filed the report. Thank you all again for all of your suggestions and support. http://i.imgur.com/ioK8k.gif




EDIT: 

hey all,


i really appreciate everyone’s prayers and efforts to put the word out to find my sister. i spoke with a detective at the Corona police department, and he said that he spoke with jennifer and she is alive. he informed her of her statUs as a missing person. jennifer said that she would be in contact with me… she hasn’t.. as frustrated and hurt as i am regarding this whole situatioN, i believe that it is indeed her choice to act this way, no matter how selfish, foolish, and inconsiderate it is. she has completely changed her lifestyle, and at this time wants nothing to do with her former life.. while i can say that i've been able to find out a lot about her activities and whereabouts, she's not in a ""safe"" place so to speak, but she is making a conscious decision to live this way.. it would have been nice of her to at least say a simple fuck you so as to leave nobody worried about her whereabouts, but she didn’t. now at least we know. and that being said, i respect her choice to live that way, even if it means abandoning her beloved daughter. again, Thank you all for spreading the word about my sister, your words of kindness, and for understanding that the reasons i had to be alarmed were legitimate.. may the flying spaghetti monster be with you all. :o)",,False,self,t5_2qq2q,True,,,True,t3_lshu0,http://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/lshu0/reddit_my_sister_disappeared_have_you_seen_her/,

Their pork sandwich consists of pork schnitzel, pulled pork, bacon. Its the trifecta of pork. They also have great daily specials to change things up for those junkies who eat there twice a day. I'm not ashamed.

Of course in doing so I have tightened my wallet a fair deal. To try and help make ends meet, I'm offering to take anyone sailing for $20/hr.

If you've looked into renting a sailboat around here before you'll know this generally half the going rate (part of why I got my own boat was that to rent a boat for a few hours was unjustifiably expensive here).

The boat is in good condition and moored on Harbor Island, by the airport. I've just moved to San Diego after living on and sailing a 33 foot Newport sailboat for three years, so am comfortably experienced on the water. Sailing South of Harbor Island has a great view of downtown and nice winds for those who want to get some speed.

You don't need to have any sailing experience, I can run the boat and just take you around San Diego Bay. If you'd like to learn some, or get more experience sailing I am more than happy to show you what I know and let you have run of the boat (assuming the winds aren't too strong and the is a risk of serious damage due to confidently jiving).

Currently I am free to take people out anytime Tues-Thurs, Midnight sails Saturday and Sunday. 9 to Noon Friday-Sunday.

The boat can take up to three people other than myself and I can accept cash or check. Email me at dickssailing@gmail.com if you want more information or to set up a time to sail.

Whatever the case I'd like the bed of my truck back, and I'm guessing you'd like your bike back.

My husband and I moved back from Augusta, GA and have found that most of our old buddies have moved away. We both go to school and both are not really into the bar scene so we have found it hard to meet some cool people. Let me know, SDReddit, if you would like to attend a meetup!
Also, any suggestions for a venue?

EDIT: Wow! I'm glad that there is alot of interest. You guys make me so happy! I like the idea of a park for the venue! I think that maybe we should try to plan some sort of event to do (scavenger hunt, games, etc.) Any ideas for this as well?

Edit v.2: wintyfresh suggested North Park Recreational Center at 1:00pm on Saturday, April 9th. This sounds good to me, does anyone have any problems with this? If you can attend, please shoot me a PM and I'll start a RSVP list. I also think that everyone bringing a small side dish would be cool, that way no one has to worry about bringing a main dish, everyone can just munch on side dishes. 

Edit v.3: etymonitude suggested that I add what everyone is going to be bringing so we don't end up with 20 bags of chips or potato salad. I'm going to start adding side dishes to anyone who lets me know what they are bringing.

Edit v.4: If anyone has any ideas for games or anything to do for this meetup, throw it out there.

Edit v.5: Based on a recommendation of a good friend, I got the game "" The Warewolves of Miller's Hollow"". Said friend said it was a super fun game for groups of 8+. Anyone ever played this game? After reading the directions it sounds pretty fun! Here's the link to the game: http://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-849418-Werewolves-Millers-Hollow/dp/B0009Z3M8S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;qid=1302050759&amp;sr=8-1. 

Edit v.6: There were some questions re: bringing alcohol so I found this on the site for the park. ""Alcoholic beverages are permitted in most County parks, providing the alcoholic content does not exceed 20%. No alcohol is allowed at Collier, Goodland Acres, Lamar, Lindo Lake, Nancy Jane, Old Ironsides, Rainbow, Spring Valley, or Sweetwater Lane parks. No alcohol is allowed at Hilton Head Park from May through October"".  So it looks like bring it if you've got it, everyone. Just please have a DD ready to drive you home.
