1361315893.0,352,self.summonerschool,18ukl7,Platinum is easy! A few tips for all.,Cliffore,405,53,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18ukl7/platinum_is_easy_a_few_tips_for_all/,"Hey guys! About a year ago, when Season 2 started, I thought even silver was a dream. I was a terrible player, fluctuating about 1000 elo to about 1250 elo (finally hit gold at the end of the season), and yes, I griefed a lot, thought it was elo hell, all that stuff.

Surprisingly, when this season started, it was just win after win for me. I don't know how it happened at first, but I shot easily from Gold V to Gold II in just two weeks (around 50 games, subtracting my terrible tilting habits.) http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/23846610#profile

What I realized was that it was not my mechanics that did this, but a few things that made me the better player I was. Mind you, I don't feel like I'm a 1700 elo player at all (I still make dumb mistakes) but I know that with a few good games, I can easily get Platinum. I'd like to share with you all a few small things that has greatly helped me. Oh, and I didn't write this to give the basic tips like ""buy wards"" and such. You should all know this by now and research yourself if you truly want to get better.

**Pressure the map.**
This, I believe, was the biggest issue I had. This was what made me barely a gold player. I had the mechanics down, I didn't do stupid stuff like chase or die randomly, but I could not win my games because I didn't pursue objectives that would eventually help us win the game.
Now, I can go on and on about different ways of pressuring the map, however, I personally believe the most important aspect of this are the towers.

I'm an AD carry main. Most of the time, I win my lane, but then I have no idea what to do afterwards. I wander around, farm my own jungle, come back to push my lane, and basically drag the game out. This is wrong. HEAD MID AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

Mid is an extremely important lane, and it easily allows control of the enemy's jungle, including buffs and dragon as well. If you have a role anywhere besides mid, especially top and bot, it is important to go to mid and push that tower down as soon as possible. Now, I don't mean leave your lane and wander mid to steal creeps or such, but when the time is appropriate, especially if you've won your lane.

Now, why is this important? 

Don't forget that towers net global EXP and gold to everyone on your team. It's much like dragon, and while 150 or 190 G may not seem like a lot to one individual, it all builds up to allow them to get that next item that helps them win teamfights.

Secondly, it helps your team gets organized. If everyone gathers mid to push down the lane, the other team will most likely panic and come in one at a time to try to defend their next tower (wasting time walking across the map), and some people may just end up making mistakes and walking right up to your team for a free kill. Trust me, it happens a lot, especially in the jungle, where buff steals start happening.

Just pulling off such a thing around 20 to 25 minutes during the game (or even earlier), is a huge step to snowballing to your victory.

**Recalling.**
I waste my time a lot. I randomly recall only to realize that I don't have enough gold to buy anything, and I've just missed about two waves of farm by doing so. For all lanes, don't recall unless absolutely necessary.

I'm an AD carry main (once again), and throughout the laning phase, I check to see whether I have enough gold for that first item. If I want a BF sword for 1550 gold and I only have 1300 gold, I'd rather stay in lane with no mana and farm safely so I can go back and buy that sword to dominate my opponent. The same applies for top and mid. Make sure you know what you want to buy (you can always open the shop by pressing P, I think. Or o. I do it too automatically) before actually recalling. It can save a lot of time.

Also, don't recall somewhere obvious at low health. I've been killed too many times by the enemy jungler (Ezreal's ults) for such a stupid thing. Just don't risk it.

**Ganks.**
No, I'm not talking about reacting appropriately to ganks, that comes with experience. I'm talking about proper times to call for ganks. If you're out of mana, have too much money in the bank with no items to back up your damage, it's best to tell your jungler not to gank. Too many times have I engaged in some gank because my jungler came, and then realized I didn't have the damage or mana to successfully get a kill. It even backfired on me sometimes.

This will only end up wasting time, possibly burn summoner spells for no use, and even ultimates. Know your items, your opponent's items, and save mana for an ultimate if you know you will be needing it soon for a gank.
Too many times have I wanted to press that R on Graves to finish off an opponent with Collateral Blow, and then ""Oh ****, no mana, LOL!""

**Chasing.**
Don't do it. It's not worth it, especially if you end up going over halfway through the map.
It's hard at low elo, but many people don't keep track of where they last saw an opponent. I've seen chases deep into a jungle only to have an opponent that had just revived come back and kill that very chaser.

This is a common mistake at low elo, something that happens to me occasionally as well. Yes, we all get that bloodlust, but most of the time, IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Don't do it. It's better to let a kill go instead of getting killed yourself.

**Baron. Dragon.**
""OH, WE JUST KILLED THEM ALL, AND WE HAVE ABOUT HALF HEALTH LEFT. LET'S BARON/DRAGON!"" Seconds later, enemy comes in and aces.

Don't do Baron and Dragon if you know you don't have the damage. I've seen so many comebacks because one team, after Acing the opponent, decided to manhandle Baron themselves, and then get Aced while the opponent team picks up free kills AND Baron.

It's better to heal and come back to do such objectives. This is one of the most common throws late game.
Oh, and one more thing. Inhibitor&gt;Baron. If you've just Aced the enemy team, go for the Inhibitor, and then heal and Baron. Inhibitor allows you pressure the entire map at once, much better than taking Baron and then having the opponent team turtle as you waste your time with successful or unsuccessful dives.

**Don't get cocky.**
Too common at this elo, but I occasionally get paired up with a Diamond or Platinum Season 2. And let me tell you, about three games in a row, I've been called ""gold rookie"" or ""kid"". Also, ""I ain't losing to gold rookies."" Moments later, they end up throwing the game themselves. (I still remember this Diamond Xin Zhao attempting to 1v5 just because he was a bit fed. Well, that didn't go well...)

Don't get cocky. Just don't. Especially during laning phase. Just several games ago, I ended up throwing it because I was ahead of my opponent and decided to engage/get aggressive. Twice, their jungler comes at perfect times, and I got killed along with my support, feeding the enemy AD carry four kills in a row. There's no excuse. I got cocky, didn't watch the map, was sure I was winning, and ended up throwing the game.
It's a team game. Arrogance isn't going to get you anywhere, no matter what elo you are. Yeah.

**Summoner Spells.**
Don't waste them.

Especially when you've been ignited and you still flash anyways knowing you're going to die.

Or when you flash into a tower for that last hit as an AD carry, and fail to get it, and instead, you get exhausted and die.

They have long cool downs. Flash is standard 4 minute and 10 seconds. Ignite is 3 minutes. That's a long time. So that flash you just wasted earlier to escape an inevitable death could have granted you a kill or two.
If you know you're dead, just stand there and take it like a man. Don't waste summoner spells.

I think that's all. For now. Yeah. Wow, how did I type this much...

Edit #2:  Lots and lots of negative comments here.  Thank you to all those who've supported it so far.  Here's a few notes though:

**But, there are tons of words with multiple meanings!  What about those?**

If you use this argument, you could defend calling someone a ""fag"" because it means a cigarette as well in the UK.  That's the most juvenile argument I have heard.  Yes, rape has different meanings for different people.  But as a rape survivor, no one wants to hear ""I just raped you so brutally!""  or ""You just got raped in the ass, haha!"" because it makes light of something traumatic that happens to people every single day.  This word is only used regularly  in the competitive esports sector of gaming, which also has a reputation of being one of the least inclusive, hateful, immature, and offensive communities in all of gaming.

**You should just suck it up and deal with it.  If you can't, get off the internet.**

No.  I'm not going to check myself out of living because the world contains racists and homophobes either.  Instead, I'm going to try to influence culture and make a game that I love a better place for people other than straight white dudes.  

**You must be a stupid teenager who has nothing better to do.**

Actually, I'm almost 30.  I work in the video game industry as a Studio Director, meaning that I run our entire studio from QA, development, art, design, and community/customer service.  I'm also currently the producer of 4 titles, was nominated for an award this year from Microsoft Women in Games, have been published in the Official XBox Magazine, and I'm the lead editor of a video gaming website.  I'm actually doing pretty well for myself, and I'm incredibly passionate about the video game industry.  It's a fucking terrible place to work at times as a woman.  And I'm not shutting up until both the industry and the gaming communities that play these games stop and think about just how unwelcoming they are to women, people of color, LGBT people, disabled individuals and other marginalized groups.

Over the course of my career I have seen an absurd amount of situations that shouldn't have happened or could have gone better if something was played slightly different than how it was.  While trying to sleep I came up with this idea that everyone could participate in.

The idea is simple.  Every week or every few days I would post a random situation at different points in the game that people would most likely find themselves in at one point in their league career.  I would of course include item builds for every champion involved, map positions and recent events.  

The idea here is for everyone, fresh 30s, bronze, silver, gold, diamond, etc. to give their own input and see how other players think when faced with certain decisions that may or may not change the tide of the game.  I really wanna help people in this sub but since I am not exactly in a position to coach someone there isn't much I can do and the best way that I feel I can help is by throwing something out that I have seen or is common enough that summoners can easily find themselves staring at while in game and getting everyone to give their own unique ideas to improve.  

EDIT as of 9:57PM CST: Thanks for all your feedback on the matter.  I can definitely see that you guys would be interested in this kind of thing.

2) Playing a melee champion, you can stand just enough distance behind your own minion to auto the other guy when he tries to CS.

**CHECK Auto-display targets**

You can see the stats of whatever you attacked, so I really like this for trading and buff control.

**UNCHECK Auto Acquire Targets**

You know when you attack a minion that dies then you start attacking another minion? This stops that. You used to have to press S after a last hit to stop auto-ing another minion. This removes that.

**UNCHECK Use movement prediction**

Movement prediction is for people with high ping and lets you see what is happening smoother. But THE TRUTH IS NOT SO. Not using it will be more accurate at the expense of choppy animation.

1371337341.0,255,self.summonerschool,1gf9z7,The best tip I can think of: MAN MODE.,bombeater,302,47,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gf9z7/the_best_tip_i_can_think_of_man_mode/,"I'm just a lowly Silver I player, but I've written some solid advice that has benefited members of this sub before (I'm most proud of my reply to ""[As a jungler, how do I make the enemy team regret being duo top?](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1bvvis/as_a_bronze_1_jungler_what_do_i_do_if_the_other/c9alykk)""). I just realized today that my favorite League mantra has never really been mentioned here:

**MAN MODE**.

MAN MODE is how you win games. It got me from Bronze V to Silver I. It's called MAN MODE, but it is accessible to all players, whether you are a male, female, transgendered, genderqueer, genderless, or a duck! MAN MODE is a state of mind. MAN MODE is a way of life!

To understand MAN MODE (which must always be in all caps), you must first understand these two universal truths:

1. **Extraordinary success requires extraordinary risks**.

 Cowering under your tower or in the bushes as your team jockeys for positioning is like saying, ""That's OK. I don't really want dragon anyway."" MAN MODE applies to everyone, but it's *even more important* for front-line initiators like Malphite, Vi, Xin Zhao, Alistar, Leona, Thresh, and so on. **Take up space**. Assert yourself. As your team's front-line, it's **your job** to give your squishies enough breathing room to poke, position themselves, and follow up on engagements.

 You say you don't usually play support? Here's all you need to know: MAN MODE. Stand in front of your ADC. Give them some space to last-hit. Take a shot for them if necessary. Slam a ward into the river and watch that thing like a hawk. Nothing surprises you in MAN MODE.

 If you have trouble getting into the mindset, play Vi and turn Voice Volume all the way up. Her gameplay quotes are quintessential MAN MODE concepts.

2. **The only unacceptable mistakes are the ones from which you learn nothing**.

 Tower-dive. Go 1v2. Go 1v3! **GO 1v5**! Be creative. Try wacky situational builds. Get flamed  by your team. Get reported. When you're behind, swallow your pride and go MAN MODE by playing from behind *perfectly*: build tanky, keep the map warded, catch your cocky opponents out of position. The only rule is that you should strive to *never make the exact same mistake twice*. To do this, you need to carefully analyze every single mistake, every death, every loss, every time an enemy gets away with a smidgeon of health.

 Make mistakes, but make **good** mistakes. Don't make stupid mistakes: if you have absolutely no plan, not even a plan for coming up with a plan, don't assume it's going to work out in your favor. That's not MAN MODE. That's just embarrassing. But MAKE GOOD MISTAKES. *If you're not making mistakes, it means you're not trying hard enough*.

Be prepared, because living these truths will make people *furious*. If you've ever made a huge lifestyle change like losing weight, finding or giving up religion, or overcoming a psychological disorder like depression, you'll know what I'm talking about. When people see someone who has the audacity to go MAN MODE and punch mediocrity in the face, they get jealous, and then they get angry, and then they get *mean*. They will use every tool at their disposal to neutralize the threat of your increasingly undeniable progress. They will shame you. They will appeal to your doubts and your fears. You'll hear stuff like this:

&gt; *""You're not good enough to play that way yet.""*

**WRONG**! Playing creatively is how you learn your limits, and then learn to exceed them. Only you can decide what level of risk is acceptable based on your familiarity with the game. **MAN MODE**.

&gt; *""It's unfair to your team when you take too many unnecessary risks.""*

**WRONG**! This might hold water in Ranked 5's, but in solo queue, your team is a ragtag cluster of individuals with unique goals. Yeah, you all want to win (hopefully), but everyone wants something slightly different out of each game: some play to win, some play to improve, some play for fun, most play for a mixture of all three. MAN MODE is about playing to improve and learning how to do risk assessment on the fly.

Even further, change your attitude about other people's mistakes. True MAN MODE is contagious, and spreads to your teammates like a virulent STD, but with morale and pentakills instead of cold sores. If your jungler tower-dives Irelia and gets outplayed, encourage them for making a ballsy play! ""That was a good try, Hecarim. I think the only mistake you made was underestimating the cooldown on her stun. **MAN MODE!!**""

&gt; *""It's arrogant to think you know better than everyone else. You're just an average schmo; you need to accept that certain ways of playing are the most effective and stick with those.""*

**[WROOOONNNNG](http://i.imgur.com/aZdxkXL.jpg)**!!! Having the confidence to take risks, make mistakes and push your limits is not the same as arrogantly discarding all tradition and criticism. Rules and ""best practices"" don't exist to be broken. They also don't exist to be blindly followed. They exist to serve a higher purpose (in the case of LoL, winning), and you will obey or discard them with increasing freedom as your understanding of the higher purpose matures.

[BUT PLEASE, GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE CONFLATING CREATIVITY WITH HUBRIS! I PROMISE TO TAKE YOUR VAPID CRITICISM VERY SERIOUSLY!](http://i.imgur.com/HBQwTyv.jpg)

Above all, MAN MODE means *doing what works*. Your brain is now a finely-tuned bullshit filter: when someone criticizes you, you are only conscious of whatever useful criticism that can be gleaned from their froth-mouthed ranting. Since most people have nothing constructive to say and are just trying to project their mediocrity on to you, this means you will mostly just hear a faint buzzing.

**HOWEVER**, on those rare occasions when people *do* offer sound advice, the true devotee of MAN MODE accepts and absorbs it gratefully, even if they don't do anything with it right away. It doesn't matter if the advice is packaged in a gentle sugar-coated plea from a timid friend, or a vicious rant from your apoplectic 0/5/0 mid-laner who's AFKing ""*BECSUASE FK NOOB JUGNLER WANTS 2 COUTNER JUGNLE WITH NO VISIOBN!!!!1*"".

Remember: You are a skill-seeking cyborg badass sent from the future to destroy all foolishness, hesitation, and tree-huggin' hippies from our time period. You will process all useful input regardless of the blood pressure and language of the messenger. Their all-caps rant comes in one end, and ""You shouldn't counter-jungle with so few wards"" comes out the other. Then you assess the accuracy, adjust your approach if necessary, file it away, and move on.

That's all I got. When in doubt, GO MAN MODE! Are you a squishy back-liner having trouble jockeying over Baron because your Malphite is standing in a bush? Encourage him in Team Chat! ""This is your time to shine, Malphite! You're our front-line. Go MAN MODE!"" It doesn't matter who gets baron. You went MAN MODE.

**It doesn't matter whose nexus explodes**. Real victory is balling as hard as possible and going MAN MODE without regrets. Savor the bitter wine of being bested by a superior opponent even more than you bask in the glow of victory. Losing is *better* because it means you can still be even more awesome. If both teams go full-tilt and play their hearts out, there are no winners and losers. Only men. (And women.)

(And ducks.)

I will also not talk much about last hitting(I'm awful at it) nor warding (I ward less than most) as i'm sure you've heard the spiel by now. I will try to keep this as general as possible but I am a mid/jungle main and will be biased. Also you cannot win every game, everyone knows this and no one needs convincing**

Yesterday morning some fellow added me with a simple request: ""spectate and teach me"". I obliged, and after a one-sided loss offered to duo q with him since chatting was easier and spectating would get boring fast.

I hopped on a bronze III smurf and started a 20 game 13 hour session, my foray into the fabled Elo Hell. The end result? 19wins, 1 loss.

I'll start off by saying that bronze elo is insanely toxic. Champ select spammed, people calling a loss before loading begins, flaming, whining, blaming all game every game. **Dont let it get to you**

Why do I mention this? This is why I lost a game, and it was my fault. We had just ended a really close 45min game where my teammates absolutely refused to cooperate and it got me riled up. Enter the next game where I'm supporting a cait that is unable to identify our early game strength leaving me to make some bad trades with their adc; I tell her to ""wake up"". minutes later jungler asks why did we not react to his gank and I respond with ""I was low, cait is bad"". Following this I decided to take 6 cs to complete my mejai, unfortunately this was the last straw for cait who promptly announced afk. I shouldn't have let that previous game get to me, and I shouldn't have taken it out on cait whose only fault was a lack of matchup knowledge. We end up losing  a tight 4v5 which could've been won if our mid was better, but **would've** been won if it was 5v5.


Now I will go through each part of your average ranked game giving my thoughts and tips on how to abuse/correct the mistakes I identified in these bronze matches.

##**Pre-game**    
Please get some proper rune pages. [This is what I had to play with](http://imgur.com/AGOkIok) Replace ap with 4.5 crit dmg for the ad page. I cried a little when I saw them. This information is easily obtained on champion guides and other instructional league sites, I'm still going to list my preferences:

*AP*: mpen marks, armor seals, flat mr glyphs, ap quints - it is so standard im always shocked to not see it on other people's accounts.

*AD*: ad marks, armor seals, flatmr/mr per level glyphs(depends on lane and opposing team, if you cant afford both go with flat mr), ad quints - the ad will help you last hit. 

You only need two runepages, just make them versatile.


##**Champ-select**

There's a lot to say about champ select, but if I had to pick two key aspects of the picking phase they would be to **aim for a balanced team** and **trust your teammates**. Teemo wants to APC bot? no problem, just make sure you got ad dmg in another lane. Please don't pick ""op"" champs just because they aren't banned; a poorly played champ is a useless one, no matter how popular he is at the moment. You will see much better results by playing what you are comfortable with. And please don't flame your teammate just because he firstpicks Leblanc or counters himself, chances are he knows what he's doing.

If you are firstpick don't ban what everyone else is banning, ask your team what they are uncomfortable playing against, and if no one answers ban those you are uncomfortable playing against.

By the time you see the loading screen, you need to make sure of two things:

1. Your team is still in high spirits(this is harder than it sounds) 

2. Your team comp is balanced: magic and ad dmg, at least 1(preferably 2) tanky champs and if you are feeling frisky a little synergy never hurt anyone.

How do you achieve this? Make sure you know how to play 2 champs for every role. **You** need to fill the team's needs, because **you** are trying to gain elo. I'm not saying to firstpick support every game, but if someone calls mid just check their lolking stats. Are they decent? Yes -&gt; let him take it. No -&gt; ""Sorry I'm going to mid"". If they insist further, just let it go, play jungle and babysit him. If tensions arise just try to soothe everyone ""calm down guys"", ""relax lets enjoy this win"", etc.

##**lvl 1 items**

What should you get? sustain sustain sustain sustain. It's sad but true that the best start for some champs is 9 or 11 health potions and a ward or two. I'm not going to go on about it but I saw a few dorans starts so I'm mentioning it anyway.

##**lvl 1 shenanigans**

1. Be ready when loading finishes. I know this isn't always possible, but if your entire team is there from the get-go it does help.

2. Invading/counter invading: Look at their team comp, look at yours. Who is going to invade? Should you invade? How do you know? Spammable spells and cc win level one. You do NOT want to fight a cassio/ez team. Special mention for blitz: in low elo, blitz invades vs a blue starter are so predictable it's not fair. Stack 5 in a bush with tank in front, adc in back and wait for the facecheck. Enjoy 2 or 3 kills every time(happened twice to us in the span of 20 games, with them raging from the start it's almost guaranteed win) If a skirmish breaks out **use your health potions asap and auto attack as much as possible**. Support placing a tactical ward is always helpful.

3. No invades happened - doesn't mean you should afk at your tower waiting for creeps, you should never do this!!! You are either afk in fountain cus you went to take a piss or you are alert and with your team until the 1:20 mark.

4. **get all the xp you can from jungle**(I had a wk start blue but refuse to do wolves, so I did them with my duo q - leblanc + taric - cost us 1 pot each)

    1. *blue side*: bot should always try to get double golems(then help jungler if red start). mid and top should wolves if red start(jungler does wraiths alone, i know it sucks buddy but you gotta take one for the team) or help jungler with wolves every time(yes im talking to you top afk under your tower at 1:30 in half my games)

    2. *crappy side*: bot should try to stop double golems (then help jungler if blue start). mid and top should do wraiths(jungle does wolves alone or with ad help while support stops golems)

Congratulations, you have now arrived at the 2:00 mark with more xp than your opponent from jungle and/or successful lvl 1 fight, let the battle of wits begins.


##**The early early laning phase**

Before you even enter lane, you should know your champion matchup. What are your strengths? What are his? Do you have experience with this matchup? Do you know his skills? Is he a strong laner? Are you? Are you weak against a gank? Is he? This applies to all, jungler included. Are you weak against a counter-jungle, or strong enough to invade? maybe you should consider starting red with that amumu, or ask support for a ward there. You **should** have an answer to all of these questions. If you do not you simply need more league experience.

You now have a firm grasp(or not) of what's ahead of you, so let's approach the creeps. First things first: Where did the opponent come from? blue or red? use this information to guess where their jungler is at all times during early game, even without a ward. If you can't tell from mid, look at minimap, which lane arrived last? They most likely helped their jungler. This allows you determine which side of the lane is safest (mid) or how soon you are likely to be ganked (top/bot). 

The next step is to look at your opponent's items and stats (specifically mr/armor and ad/ap) before you get your first cs in order to identify any mistakes. No sustain? no mr mid vs a strong laner? no armor vs a high range champ or ad mid assassin? This right here is setting off plans in your head for early kills. These are big mistakes that should and must be abused right from the start. The earlier you build a lead, the harder you will carry.

Regardless of the itemization/rune/mastery mistake the opponent has made, there is only one answer: start trading damage with him. If you are evenly skilled at harassing you will pull slightly ahead, if you are more skilled you can easily **zone them lvl 1**. If you are less skilled(and you will notice this right away) practice this because it is a vital laning skill. When harassing always think about maximizing your damage; if you have higher range on ability,  AA first then use spell then back up so creep dmg doesnt screw you Or AA -&gt; ability -&gt; AA.
*Important note:* being the initiatior when harassing will push your lane. If you are a weak laner and/or their jungler is a strong ganker this is not desirable. Act accordingly.

This is where I give you the single biggest laning mistake I've identified on my way up the ladder. **Use your health pot as soon as you lose health**. Simple right? Wrong. Almost everyone waits to lose 200-300 health before using their first health pot that gives them 150 back over 15 seconds. that means they wont be full til 30seconds from now, and trust me we aren't done messing with them. I personally pot at -100 health because I know I will be trading some more damage in the following 10seconds. This is especially true for weak laners: never be low health!! With proper runes no champion in this game can 100-0 you before lvl 6. This also helps you survive ganks. Remember it.

So you have now traded damage, started healing from your sustain and all the while continued increasing that creep score. This is where jungle xp comes into play. Are you playing vs a burst champ? be very very careful if you suspect the enemy got xp and you didn't. Are you the burst champ? This is more fun: you now have an xp lead from jungle, an xp lead from initiating harass, and will get lvl 2 wayyy before him. Check your xp bar after each cs and prepare the level up(i still mouse click, good on you if you can keyboard skillup), and combo(with flash if necessary) the enemy for the easiest fb ever. Shove lane into tower after kill then go buy some more damage and a ward. You have now completely crushed lane: tower will eat most of the first 2-3 waves of creeps and you have 2 levels on him. 

This works mid top and bot (support engages for bot). You should **always** be aware of this kind of scenario. If the enemy is pushing creeps faster than you, they will get their level up before you, remember this as well. Strong laners should always aim for this kill, weak laners should always aim to avoid it.

All of this happens before the jungler clears his second buff (around 2:50-3:00). I went into extreme detail regarding this minute of play because it is largely overlooked, it is a time when many laners are scary strong and others very vulnerable, it is your job to properly read the situation and play accordingly.

##**early laning phase**

For the remainder of the laning phase, always keep an eye on the wards your opponent purchases and where he places them. This will allow you to tell your jungler where they are and what route they can use for ganking.

**All of the laning phase should be a repeat of the first minute**. Nothing more nothing less: harass until the opponent makes a mistake, then kill them (this mistake can be getting in range of a flash burst mage, staying too low health under a tower, etc.) You are either a strong laner aiming for a kill, or a weak(preferably late game) laner just trying to farm as much as possible waiting for a gank. The difference being that the opposing jungler is now a threat to you and your jungler an asset for that kill.     
*Note:* Roles can be reversed if you get killed or your mid ganks a lane and gets some there. Know the state of your matchup at all times and keep an eye on the opponent's items.

Before level 6 I don't recommend ganking other lanes, you lose a lot of valuable snowball gold from creeps and let your opponent catch up/take a lead even if you are successful. Also ganking pre 6 is a lot more tricky. 

Minutes fly by and you are approaching lvl 6. At this point of the game you should still have an xp lead(wether you killed your opponent or not) and the same thought process as lvl 1 should enter your head. As soon as you get that level up you are going to gain a huge dmg output and be in a favorable position to get a kill.

##**ganking phase (also applies to jungler all game)**

You've reached level 6 and hopefully you are in one of two scenarios:

1. You've killed your opponent one or more times and he is afraid it will happen again, he is zoned under his turret waiting for you to push lane to him.(even if you are a slow pusher you can still shove it into tower)

2. You haven't killed him but have a skillset that allows you to easily push a lane.

If you have killed him 3 times or more, **do not continue farming your opponent** you will be wasting valuable resources (ignite, flash, ulti) that can be used to kill another lane worth more gold and objectives. To carry you must get fed, but you must also ensure at least one other lane does as well.

So what do you do? before doing anything you acquire the information available to you: quick glance on minimap - is either lane pushed? if one (or both) of them are, you check the health bars of players, is enemy team low? is my team low? and can they follow up if i gank? If one of your lanes is crushing the opponent under their tower and staying mid-low health(big mistake, dont be guilty of it as well) this is also a great opportunity to gank.

You've now identified a potential gank victim, you have 1 task left: make sure they don't see you coming! You have been carefully observing your lane opponent and know where the closest wards are: Always leave lane without the enemy having vision on you(*this includes creep vision*). Now you shove your lane into enemy tower and move out, where to exactly? Follow these simple routes:

[blue side gank routes](http://imgur.com/ZmaH4Gh)

[weak side gank routes](http://imgur.com/eeAfCKn)

1. green routes: these are your primary gank routes, they avoid almost all basic wards

2. blue routes: use these only if you know for certain that **only tribush is warded** (you can ask your team or you count support wards and notice they only placed 1 so far)

3. red routes: aka the lane gank. This is a great tool! use it. You should lane gank when a lane can be easily baited into attacking your apparently(or actually) weak teammates. If you notice many back and forth kills on a lane, chances of successfully lane ganking increase.

4. the purple route: the sneaky route. Special mention for this favorite of mine when bot tribush is warded. After you've ganked bot once in the back they will start warding tribush. You will move bot again, mid will call ss, but bot will think: np, we got ward. Enjoy an easy double kill. **Be careful** before passing golems bot, because creeps moving to lane will reveal you on minimap. To avoid this look top(at the pretty purple asterisk) and check that creeps are not going by your own golems, remember the map is mirrored ! As soon as the coast is clear, collect your gold bot.

5. the pink dot: for a pink ward to enable easy bot ganks + give you vision of their jungler's movements - remember to place it in bush at the angle so it sees both top bush and bottom bush.

If you have successfully ganked bot - **get dragon** thats +2k gold for your team for about a minute's worth of cs loss: worth it.

*Note*: When you start a gank route through the enemy jungle always keep an eye on the minimap. If you notice your lane and another lane closing in on you get out asap. 

*Second note*: If you have ganked bot already and you know the enemy warded the wraiths (but not the bush) AND you are confident in your ability to quickly kill your opponent, you can fake a gank and wait in bush for mid to follow you because he got yelled at for not doing it last time. boom free gold. This is risky play because the enemy knows you are in their jungle, if it doesn't work right away move out fast.

Much like the early laning phase, the ganking phase is simply a repeat of this same thought process over and over again: Go to lane. is your opponent worth gold? Attempt a kill. If you can't, push lane hard into tower and gank. Follow up with an objective. Go back to lane. **Rinse and repeat**

Good job playa, you have crushed your lane(or not given a kill if you are late-game oriented), successfully helped another lane (hopefully several times) acquire much needed gold through kills and objectives and now seek to close out this game before any talk of throwing even crosses the mind of your teammates.

During this, I learned a very sneaky trick to maximize damage, which is especially usefull for jungle elises. It allows you to put out a lot of burst damage, and confuses the enemy. The trick is as follows:

When using your Q in spider form, you may notice that your spiderlings lunge onto your target. What many people don't know is that ALL spiders will lunge, including your volatile spiderling, AKA suicide spider (your W ability in human form). So say you are hiding in a bush, about to gank someone over a wall with repel. Normally, you would hit E, repel, then start your combo. But if you first drop a spider somewhere, quickly switch to spider form, then  hit E, Repel, and use Q, you get a free exploding spider worth of damage, and can then use it again if you swap into human form. It gives you a huge burst, because it is essentially 4 abilities you are using while in spider form. Very sneak for suprise ganks on unsuspecting laners, though you must be quick or else your spider will explode before it can jump. It looks hilarious and is a ton of fun when you pull it off. Try it out for yourself!

This is mostly relevant to top and bot lanes - if you stand in your brush in range of minions and you start auto attacking, you know the brush is warded. 

If you stand there and nothing happens, it's clear!

Not sure if this is common knowledge, but I've found it super helpful while laning, especially if your jungler likes to lane gank!
Hope someone finds this useful on the Rift!

1362061391.0,224,self.summonerschool,19e9tj,What we learn from Recommended Champions.,MarcAurelius,276,52,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19e9tj/what_we_learn_from_recommended_champions/,"To all those people who are wondering why **Recommended** champions are considered ""recommended"" is, not only because they're easy to pick up and play and are deemed a ""safe"" pick. but it is because each individual recommended champion teaches you about specific mechanics in League of Legends. And let's face it League of Legends is a game based off of knowledge on mechanics, whether that be the cooldowns on the the enemy Ezreal, or the amount of DMG you deal with Katarina while only having one Blasting Wand, and as well as involving skill and communication.

Anyways, to clarify my point, I'll explain, to the best of my knowledge, what various mechanics you learn from playing these 15 Recommended champions:

 * Btw, to anyone who reads this post, if there is anything, like a key mechanic, that I missed, anything you think or know you learned from one of the champions below, please help me and everyone else out by filling in that gap. Thanks ahead.

**Annie**

 * While playing as Annie, you learn the importance of team fighting as an AP Carry and as well as the importance of CC in the game as her passive allows any one of her abilities to stun as long as the passive is to-be proc-ed.

 * Playing as Annie teaches you to how to ""stack up"" charges with her passive, so that when you play other champions that have a similar passive or ability, i.e. Ahri's Passive 35% Spell Vamp w/ 9 stacks, you have knowledge of how to do so already.

 * With this, I mean using Summon: Tibbers while her passive is ready to help you and your team achieve victory, by heavy CC and AP DMG.

 * Also, this is a more minor one but still, her Q, Disintegrate, also teaches you, indirectly, the importance of last hitting minions with it for the reward of the returned mana.

**Ashe**

 * While playing as Ashe, the key mechanics that you learn include:

 * How to kite while AA, which is key to ADCs and is a hard mechanic to master, with her 10% slow from her AAs and large AA range, this helps with the practice.

 * A minor one, but the use of her E helps with understanding the importance of map awareness. 

 * Her ult also teaches the player the importance of game-changing ults. (Although hard to aim and hit with, if used appropriately and effectively, it can be devastating.

 * The importance of farming, while not dying, is learned through playing Ashe, cause she is what one would call a ""hyper-carry,"" meaning that although she may be weak early on, she will be devastating during late game.

**Garen**

 * When playing as Garen, you learn the mechanic of how to be a lane bully, with his Q, E, R and critical hits, for being a bully in lane is a major ""do"" when playing Solo Top, as this lane is considered a ""snowball"" lane, meaning any advantage you have, is a big one. 

 * Also, you learn about how to play as an Off-Tank, a slightly tanky champion, who is able to dish out damage w/o sacrificing too much defensive capabilities.

 * While also learning how to be a lane bully, playing as Garen teaches you to also know when to back off w/o dying, for when playing as him, one can get a bit reckless with excessive poking or diving, and this can be forgiven thanks to his Passive heal. 

 * Also, a minor one, with Garen you learn when it is appropriate to save your skills and when to use them, e.g. you're pushing Top Lane and get ganked by 2 champions, 1 with a slow and 1 without. You save your Q, cause it removes slows, for when the 1 champion, let's say Olaf, lands his slow on you, activate it, and jog away unscathed.

**Katarina**

 * As you play Katarina, you begin to understand the importance of positioning, focusing, harassing, and reaction skills.

 * Positioning is learned when team fighting as Katarina, cause if you are not in position, e.g. she's out in Mid Lane clearing minions, while the rest of her team is too far behind her to allow her to Shunpo to safety in case she gets ganked, she's got a high chance of getting caught. Positioning is important so that as she applies pressure with harass, w/o getting caught, and once she does go in for kills and gets the resets, she may want to reposition herself to prepare for another kill. 

 * Focusing is learned due to her burst as champion allowing her to ""all in"" on a squishy champion, like the enemy ADC or AP Carry, and kill them and get out. 

 * Harassing is learned from her Q poke and W burst combo, and since they are both on low CDs and cost nothing to use, Katarina can constantly poke. 

 * Increasing reaction skills, similar to that of playing FPS games, is learned from her resets after receiving a kill or an assist allowing her to either continue on with her bursting or escape, or a mixture of both. 

**Master Yi**

 * Master Yi is a more difficult one to understand, but one of the major things you learn as Yi, is when or when to not tower dive or chase, for his kit is perfect for doing so and getting away.

 * His Alpha Strike let's you hit enemy's from a far once used properly securing kills under towers, with the help of his Highlander and Meditate, for if low on HP after a successful tower dive, he may go Meditate his health back in bush.
 
**Nasus**

 * Nasus teaches a player to learn the importance of farming, how to farm, and the devastating rewards of farming as a hyper-carry.

 * Since his Q scales on last-hitting, not only does this help the player learn to last hit but also teaches the importance of being passive and ""playing for late game.""

 * His W also teaches the player the importance of timing with skills, i.e. saving his W slow for a bit after a 1v1 duel begins.

**Nunu**

 * Nunu, fills a lot of roles within a team composition. He can tank, support and jungle, and sometimes even go AP Carry Mid.

 * What playing as Nunu teaches us is the importance of game-changing ults with is Absolute Zero, that being the timing on when you throw it down and how effectively you use it, i.e. not initiating with your ult or using it on  a lone Ezreal who can easily Arcane Shift out of it.

 * As jungle Nunu, it teaches you how to counter jungle the enemy jungle since his Consume deals true damage and he also has Smite. This allows the player to learn the importance of counter jungling in the game, for it makes the enemy jungler get really behind in levels, CS, and forces him to go duo lane with someone to make up for the lack of EXP and gold, effectively hindering his/her presence in other lanes.

 * As support Nunu, you learn how to zone effectively with his E Snowball, peel for his ADC with his Snowball, and as well as buffing your ADC while being tanky and healthy thanks to your Q.

**Rammus**

 * Due to Rammus' kit, a player learns how to initiate teamfights thanks to his Powerball and taunt.

 * This taunt also teaches you how to ""lead"" the focus on a champion by taunting him/her, i.e. an ADC.

 * His Defensive Ball Curl teaches the player the importance and significance of resistances, MR and Armor, when tanking, versus just large amounts of HP-stacking.

 * Also, due to his high resistances, and the ability to disengage or engage (with his Q Powerball), you can learn how to set up baits and lure enemies into a trap.

**Ryze**

 * Ryze, thanks to his passive, is all about teaching a player how to duel 1v1 and win. This mechanic that is learned is applied to all other champions, but Ryze is just a ""safer"" pick thanks to his Passive and the fact that he is fairly tanky for a ranged AP Mid

 * Ryze also helps the play understand the difference between bursting and constant DPS, in which Ryze can do both.

 * When playing as Ryze, you also learn the massive importance of CDR on AP Carry Mids, allowing you to constantly apply pressure with your spells.

 * He also teaches you about how builds can be specific to some champions, i.e. Manamune, Tears, etc. In which you learn what ""core items"" to build first, ONLY if you're doing well. 

**Sivir**

 * Sivir's kit teaches the player the mechanics on how to splitpush, so that when you play more complicated splitpushers, e.g. Nidalee, Shen, Twisted Fate etc., you'll understand the fundamentals.

 * Due to her Q, Boomerang Blade, she is able to clear minion waves almost as quickly as a Twisted Fate, thus adding to her ability to splitpush. 

 * Her kit allows her to splitpush effectively while also being extremely slippery, i.e. her Passive, E Spell Shield, and Ult. 

 * You can also learn the mechanic of kiting thanks to the same abilities mentioned above, e.g. you're solo splitpushing Top Lane, and the enemy team sends Olaf to stop you while the rest of the enemy team is fighting you team in Bot Lane. Since you're ranged, you poke the tower while poking him, weaving in and out of the tower's range, effectively kiting him thanks to you bonus MS from your Passive, Spell Shield right when he's about to use his Reckless Swing on you, and then bring the tower down and turn the focus on him, activating your ult, (Bonus AS and MS), to quickly finish him off, as he tries to run away.

**Sona** 

 * Another champion that teaches you the importance of game-changing ults, thanks to her Crescendo. With it, you learn the appropriate times to use it, whether it be for an initiation, counter initiation, or as a 2nd initiation.

 * Her kit teaches you how to support appropriately with heals, buffs, and poke/zoning DMG as an aggressive support who has little peeling potential pre-6.

 * As with Rammus, you can learn how to bait traps for your team, e.g. getting ""caught"" warding Dragon and having 4 enemy champions follow you into a bush with your allies, and then initiate with your Crescendo.

**Soraka**

 * While playing as Soraka, as opposed to playing with an aggressive support like Sona, you learn how to play as a passive support. Preferably, she is played as a passive support, meaning that she doesn't go out to ""set up"" kills, ALTHOUGH this does not mean she cannot zone for she can do that extremely effectively thanks to her silence from Infuse and her Starcall stacking.

 * Her kit allows her to be passive, zone, peel for her ADC, and keep him/her buffed and healthy. 

 * This passive play style of hers teaches the player about the idea of ""Patience for High-Rewards,"" meaning that it allows her ADC to farm and accumulate gold for items, while zoning the enemy to prevent the same from happening for the opposing team. 

 * In team fights, a player learns the importance of ""Defensive Stat Shred"" thanks to her Q stacking. 

 * Also, as with Sona and Nunu, the importance of game-changing ults is a key mechanic learned from playing as Soraka, for you need to use her Wish appropriately and effectively through timing.

**Taric**

 * As Taric, you learn the fabulous and outrageous mechanics of how to ""set up"" kills, thanks to your Dazzle.

 * You also learn the importance of Defensive Stats, due to your W aura, and the importance of auras within a team composition, i.e. your W and R.

 * Utilizing his passive, even though considered a very bad one, teaches the importance of not being OOM during laning phase, i.e. being OOM during a gank from your jungler and having both enemy ADC and Support get away since you were too OOM to CC one of them, in which the passive helps as a alternative to backing to base and missing out on exp, and opportunities to ""babysit"" for your ADC

**Tristana**

 * Tristana is another recommended champion that let's you understand the significance of Hyper-Carries, for Tristana is an absolute monster during late game, if she has performed well up to that point, thanks to her Passive increase of AA range per level, Q steroid, W kill-secure + refresh, and ult repositioning. 

 * Tristana can teach a player about how keep control of enemy champions, due to her ult Buster Shot, to push them back to your team allowing you to ""catch"" someone, similar to other champions of a bit higher difficulty like Lee Sin, Blitzcrank, Scarner, Thresh, etc. 

**Warwick**

 * Warwick, like Nunu, is another recommended champion for he can teach a player how to counter jungle, thus crippling the enemy jungler, which helps push your team ahead. 

 * His kit allows a player to sniff out an enemy who is way out of position and kill him/her, in which you learn how to literally ""not get caught."" 

 * His ult, Infinite Duress, with it's short 70 second CD, can be used to help the player learn how to initiate, and, as well as, whether or not to initiate, for his ult can place Warwick in a very vulnerable position. This key mechanic of the game sticks with a player when he begins to start playing other junglers that are fairly similar to Warwick, i.e. Jarvan IV, Xin Zhao, Maokai, etc., like Warwick, these champions can initiate teamfights extremely well, yet can also put themselves in a bad spot as well, so learning when or when not to is key.


EDIT: Wow guys! Thanks for all the feedback and add-ons! Much appreciated! :) Makes me feel good that my guide helped. Will be posting a guide on how/why certain champions, like Akali and Katarina, are deemed ""ELO climbers."" Either that or a guide on general tips like warding, counter jungling, etc. you guys are welcome to tell me what to write about and I will do so to the best of my knowledge! I'd be happy to help anyone out too on LoL, just add me: INA Aurelius

EDIT2: Just as an fyi, I am compiling a database on the stats of all champions (AS, MS, Base Armor, AA range, etc.) in to an Excel Spreadsheet, so if anyone is interested, I will post the download for it once I'm finished

1372018067.0,210,self.summonerschool,1gxb5y,A whole ton of Nami ability tips.,TacticOgre,243,33,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gxb5y/a_whole_ton_of_nami_ability_tips/,"Considered to be weak shortly after her release, Nami has received nothing but straight buffs since. As she stands now, she is a very good and versatile support champion who offers a lot of things an ADC wants from a lane partner: Sustain, crowd control, poke, disengage. Starting to see some competitive play, it's becoming quite clear that Nami has arisen to the status of a very strong support champion. However, she does require a fair bit of practice and knowledge to play properly, and since every tip helps, I've decided to write this post, which focuses on each of her abilities.

**Surging Tides (Passive)**

* Nami's passive grants a small burst of bonus movement speed to each ally you cast an ability on. This may sound a bit underwhelming, but it's not to be underestimated. Its primary use is to help your teammates kite, chase and escape, but it's also handy for moving around the map in general.

* When leaving your base, feel free to randomly cast an ability or two on your teammates. They'll get a movement speed bonus, you'll regenerate your mana instantly, and the cooldowns will be back by the time you reach your destination.

* One thing to take note of is the fact that you can apply your passive to your teammates even with those spells that don't directly affect them. For instance, tossing your bubble onto an area where an ally is standing will apply your passive to them.

**Aqua Prison (Q)**

* Also known as her trademark bubble. An area of effect 1.5 second stun, there's virtually no reason to not take this ability at level 1. However, you'll probably want to max it last - at rank five, Aqua Prison's cooldown is only 4 seconds shorter, and the stun duration stays the same. The area of effect is actually surprisingly large, you'll find yourself hitting two champions with it more than you'd expect.

* Famous for being tough to land, it requires a bit of practice with reading enemy movement. Due to the nature of the ability, it's nice against enemies who's movement can be easily telegraphed to you: Twisted Fate, Lissandra and Jarvan IV are all fantastic examples. Conversely, it becomes a bit more difficult to use against very nimble champions, such as Vayne, Kassadin and Ezreal.

* Even though it may look like a knockup, Aqua Prison is still a stun. It can be cleansed and QSS'd and its duration is reduced by tenacity, so keep that in mind.

* Don't hesitate to use it in lane when you see someone out of position. It's not just for disengages or all-ins.

* Q becomes significantly easier to land when the enemy is already stunned/snared/slowed. If the opportunity presents itself, you can try casting E on yourself, slowing the enemy with a basic attack, and landing an easier bubble that way.

* Some of the easiest bubbles to land are when your target has no vision of you. Use the brush and tricks with line of sight as much as possible. 

* If you're trying to escape from a melee character who's already on your back, toss your Q right in front of your feet (or fins...), dodging a point blank Aqua Prison is almost impossible.

* When walking up to ward a brush, it's often a good idea to toss a bubble in there to avoid facechecking it. If someone's there, the stun will give you plenty of time to put the ward down and run away. If not, then no big deal, still better safe than sorry. Hitting someone in the fog of war also grants vision of them.

* Although it's a cheap ability to use to apply your passive onto someone, being without your primary crowd control leaves you vulnerable. As such, the only time I recommend using it for the movement speed boost is when you're leaving base.

**Ebb and Flow (W)**

* A prime laning and teamfighting tool, it provides both sustain and poke, bouncing off of both enemies and allies. Depending on how efficiently you use it, it can affect up to three players: Either healing two and poking one, or poking two and healing one. Because of this, and the fact that the bounce range is fairly close to an average ADC's autoattack range, it's a godlike tool for 2v2 trades in lane.

* If you cast it on an ally, afterwards the ability finds an enemy to bounce to, and if it does, then it finds one more ally to bounce to. If you cast it on an enemy, the opposite is true. Which means that in the ideal situation: Cast on ally = Heal &gt; Poke &gt; Heal; Cast on enemy = Poke &gt; Heal &gt; Poke. Weigh both options, and decide whether at the moment you need more health, or more damage.

* In my experience, this ability is actually much harder to use to its full potential than Aqua Prison, due to the bounce component. I'd say that reading good opportunities to cast your W and taking advantage of them is the most difficult part of playing Nami.

* Be smart about using your W, don't just spam it every time it's off cooldown. Its mana cost becomes very high very fast, but you'll quickly realize it justifies itself when you're hitting multiple players with it. 

* Don't jeopardize yourself with the ability either, try to avoid putting yourself in a needlessly dangerous position just to get an extra bounce.

* Even though you want to be hitting as many people as possible with it at all times, often settling for two hits is just fine, and if you're in a particularly bad situation, don't be afraid to just heal your ADC under tower. Be very careful not to drain your mana pool this way, though - often all they need is a little health boost in order to safely hit creeps, and then they'll just lifesteal their life back that way.

* In more complex scenarios, try think of the most efficient bounces you can pull off. Example: Between you and your teammate, there is an enemy. You want to heal your teammate, and can do so if you use Ebb and Flow on your enemy, because everyone is in bounce range. However, casting it immediately on the enemy would be wasting a bounce that could have otherwise gone to you. Furthermore, there's no way to predict that the heal won't actually bounce to you instead of your teammate. In this case, one correct thing you could do is cast it on yourself. That way, it heals you, jumps onto the enemy, and from the enemy onto your ally.

**Tidecaller's Blessing (E)** 

* At rank one this ability is Nami's cheapest one (55 mana), which makes it the best candidate for applying your passive to teammates. The cost increases with ranks, but it still remains the best skill for reliably giving movespeed boosts.

* Understanding the advantages your AD carry gains from Tidecaller's Blessing is an important part of knowing the best times to cast the ability. The on-hit slow, along with the movement speed boost from your passive gives them a massive, but short burst of greatly enhanced kiting potential - this advantage naturally becomes more valuable the more mechanically skilled your lane partner is. Tidecaller's Blessing can also help less skilled players though, an ADC who has difficulty last hitting properly will have an easier time farming with the extra damage (it's also helpful for farming under the turret).

* Your E is also a decent chasing tool, don't hesitate to put it on anyone who can easily apply the slow onto someone who's running away, including yourself.

* Even though your AD Carry is usually the best candidate to proc all three hits as fast as possible, once he or she gets enough attack speed, eventually they'll start attacking much faster than it takes for the slow to fully wear off. What this means is that some of the slow component of the spell goes to waste, because it gets refreshed with every hit instead of stacking. This doesn't mean that you should never cast your E on your ADC if your goal is to slow people down, but it's something to keep in mind.

* Another thing to remember is that the damage from the ability stays the same no matter who you cast it on. That means that although the ADC will usually apply the damage the fastest, in the end you can cast it on anyone and still end up dealing just as much damage. Which means that when deciding on a target, the things you have to consider are the movement speed boost, the slow, and how fast you need to deal the damage. Many melee champions will appreciate the sticking power of the ability.

**Tidal Wave (R)**

* Although the duration of the slow increases from 2 up to 4 seconds depending on the distance the wave traveled, the knockup always stays the same. This means that you should never worry about having to cast it point blank, but when you do use it from a distance, you gain an extra benefit.

* Because of this ability's ridiculously long range and the fact that it applies your passive to teammates, it's most advantageous to cast this ability as an initiation tool while standing behind the rest of your team - they get to run in faster, while the enemy is knocked up and slowed.

* Although the wave moves slowly, it's still difficult for most enemies to outrun it without some serious movement speed boosts. Still, don't count on always landing it.

* Even though it's a good initiation ability, it's also fantastic for disengaging or rescuing teammates. When an ally in trouble is running towards you and you cast your ultimate, it becomes extremely hard for the enemy to dodge it because of the much shorter time they have to react.

* Due to the slow nature of the spell, it often works as a very good followup to someone else's initiation, similarly to Sona's ultimate. If Malphite charges in with Unstoppable Force, there's virtually no escape from Tidal Wave.

Welcome to League of Legends, you don't suck.

Apologies in advance to all readers, I have written this fairly quickly so there are probably many spelling or grammatical errors.


I am going to save you all some pain. A lot of pain. You already are a great player. There is no argument to this fact. Your mechanics, knowledge of the game and execution are exactly what they should be for someone with your background. If your past was different, or you had different genetics, or you had different life experience or a different gaming background you might have reached this point with more or less skill. You can't change any of that. Your skills are a deterministic result of your past. You are here now. Welcome.


There are several common misconceptions and reoccurring mistakes I have noticed that are rampant within this community. I hope to enlighten anyone who will listen. For your benefit and everyone elses.


Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. 


Yes I just quoted Sun Tzu. Yes I realise how lame that might appear. Get over it. This is LoL in it's essence, encapsulated succinctly for you. Long term success in this game is all about who makes the least mistakes. There is far less to this game left to chance than you think.


You will be making many mistakes throughout your journey. That's good. Make as many mistakes as possible and learn from them. The sooner you learn from them the faster you will improve. I will tell you right now. No matter what skill level you are at, even if you are the best player in the world , you don't know enough to comprehend the mistakes you are making. Learn the concept of the Dunning-Kruger effect, it applies to most of the community you will be playing with and yourself right now. The meta will shift, people will evolve and discover new techniques and Riot will update the game.


Those of you who have already reached this conclusion by yourself, congratulations, we need more people like you out there.


The fastest possible way to improve is as follows:


Find the biggest mistake you are making. 


What's the biggest mistake you are making you might ask? It's the mistake that is impacting your  odds of success the most that can be fixed with the least amount of effort, training or knowledge. Improving is all about getting the best improvement ROI for your time. Always. Seek that out.


Your biggest mistake will constantly change for you as you evolve. Work on fixing that mistake until something else becomes your “biggest mistake”. 


As we have already established, there is a high probability you don't have enough knowledge to determine what your biggest mistake is. Find someone who is better than you, who understands more about the game than you do. If they truly have a better understanding of the game than you do, they are in a better position than you are to determine your biggest mistake.


Have zero shame in seeking this advice out and admitting your faults. Staying within your own knowledge due to pride is a huge mistake that will hurt your progress as it will take you far longer to break plateaus and evolve. By finding people better than you, you are simply handling things like a true pro. You are improving the fastest way possible. There is nothing wrong with this and don't feel afraid at all to do so. Improving on your own is slower. It's the way of the loser. You are not omniscient, get over yourself, it's the best thing you can do.


The team that has by far the highest probability of winning a LoL match is the team that makes the least amount of mistakes. The problem is there are almost an infinite amount (for practical purposes) of mistakes that can occur in a game. Some of these include, champion selection, mechanical skill, timing, execution, positioning, psychology, team chemistry and on and on and on. 


The difference between a high skilled player and low skilled player is on average far less mistakes are made.  This brings me to my next point.


Almost the entire community doesn't understand the true concept of Elo hell. Here is the truth. Elo hell does exist. But you're wrong about where Elo hell occurs. 


True Elo hell is when you reach an Elo far below your skill and due to the number of games already played, will require you to play a large number of games to normalize your results so that you are ranked at your true Elo. But the part where most people get it wrong is as follows: Elo hell only exists for players with a very high Elo and this gets perpetually worse the higher you go . Yes you read that correctly.


The lower your Elo rating gets, the more you will participate in matches where the number of mistakes made by both teams increases.


More mistakes being made is great news for you. More mistakes simply equals more opportunity for you to leverage your higher skill set to win the game.


The inverse is true for higher Elo, less mistakes occurring equals less opportunities for you to prove yourself statistically better which in turn equals more games needed to be played to normalize your Elo to its true state. 


The lower your Elo, the easier it is for you to play your way out of it. Sorry to burst your bubble. The biggest commonality in all of your games played to date, is simply this: you played in all of them. Occam's razor says that you by far are the biggest determinant in the outcome of your games as a whole. Believing otherwise is foolish and is only holding you back. 


One of the worst and most common mistakes that is absolutely plaguing the league at lower levels (and stopping players from progressing) are players that blame or abuse other people. Don't do it. 


Ever. 


Short of deliberately running into the other team's nexus, it's one of the quickest ways to lose. Bad things happen, ok we get it. Mistakes are made. You and other players will have bad games. Sometimes low probability events will stack up and a player on your team will lose the lane. Players on average will  vary between good and bad games with few or many mistakes. You are no different.


Learn how to handle things not going your way. Don't be a child. Don't poison your team. Realise you are responsible for how your entire team as a whole plays. You have the power to effect in game decisions and how things play out.


If someone is getting beaten down, never all talk and say “GG noob karthus is feeding mid”. This is cancer to your team. This just displays to everyone playing in the game that you are insecure about how everyone else perceives you. It flags that you feel the need to establish that your skill is different and that you need everyone else to know. This shows that you are fragile and mentally weak. You aren't being a leader and you aren't taking responsibility for how your team performs, you are deliberately choosing to poison your own team. It's as bad as feeding and is effectively an automatic loss.


Negative comments start a chain reaction of negativity throughout the whole team. If you are playing at a lower Elo players in your team can't handle these thoughts and function properly at the same time. Thanks for throwing the game. If you are lucky enough to win the game it's because your team won despite of you, not because of you. You were the noob who dragged the team down.


Be aware of how your actions impact team chemistry and morale. Once you poison the team with a statement like this, don't expect your team to be able to think or function well for the rest of the game. They will be too busy trying to argue with you or busy thinking about how much they dislike playing with you. Instead they need to be focused on last hitting, the minimap and many other things.


This information should put you ahead of the curve to begin with. Good luck with your journey. It will be a fun one and there are plenty of good people here to help you at the summoner school.

I've noticed many players, mostly low elo players, simply give up and feed when they are camped. Though, as a jungler myself, I can tell you that camping a lane is not necessarily the most useful use of my time.  

The aim of this post is to emphasis on why you should be happy when your lane is camped. Ok, you have died a couple of times, and you know their jungler is camping. What is good?

- You are not a stupid player who will feed over and over. You will play safely and wait for end-game. In the meanwhile, their jungler will have lost farm. Moreover, your two other lanes will have had more ganks from your jungler that from the enemy one, thus gaining an opportunity to win.  
- You are not a stupid player, you will buy wards. A ward is 75 gold. No ward forces you to play defensively or to die stupidly, which is equivalent to more than 75 gold. Buy many wards, and wait for the end-game.  
- You are not a stupid player. If one of your teammates had been camped, they would probably have given up, fed, and your team would have lost the game. But their jungler chose you. You will be smart and patient. You will lose some CS, and you won't be able to carry that game. Yet, you will win, thanks to your teammates. And you know it, because - you knwo what - you are not a stupid player.  

So, please, next time you are camped. Don't feed. Don't give up. Don't even think ""Oh Crap"". That is a good news.

Cya.

So let’s have a look at what League of Legends (LoL) is composed of. We have 3 lanes, the Jungle area between them and 5 players to fill this area. By simple mathematics you can see that one area must house at least 2 players to begin with, this means that the players sharing a lane will also share experience.


In today’s modern Meta, Meta being defined as the current optimal composition to win a game, we have 5 different roles, these being:


* **Ranged Attack Damage Carry** – This is the person who will matter the most as the game goes on longer, they must be a champion who scales very well with items and therefore needs to gain a lot of money to afford these items. They will usually be in the Bottom lane, and paired up with a Support Champion, and must get the last hit (or killing blow) on as many Creeps (Minions) as possible to generate enough income to buy items, they share a lane before AD Carries do not scale as well on levels as other champions do, such as AP Carries, so giving them a lane with another champion is not such a deficit. Example AD Carries are: Tristana, Caitlyn, and Varus


* **Support** – This is the person who will be guarding the AD Carry, his job is the make sure they are as safe as possible while they lane and last hit creeps. A Support is usually a Champion who does not require a high amount of gold to become useful, they will have abilities that control (CC (Crowd Control)) other players, this can be in the way of slowing, stunning, fearing etc. They will not be last hitting minions themselves, their main goal is to buy gold generation items (GP10s) that give the holder more gold than they would normally generate, they also will buy defensive team items, such as a sightstone, which allows them to ward the map for a cheap cost effective rate. Example Support Champions are: Leona, Lulu, and Janna


* **Assassins and Mages** - These champions will be located in the Middle lane, they usually scale very well with levels and experience as the base damage (damage before item stats are added) are very high, they will also be last hitting minions and trying outplay the enemy in their lane. The champion will need to be able to carry out a few simple needs as well; they must be able to shove their lane effectively, meaning they need a way to quickly kill all the enemy creeps in their lane so that their minions will push into the enemy’s turret. The other need is the ability to roam around the map and generate pressure, pressure is defined as creating difficulties for the enemy team, be this in the form of ganking (entering a different lane to your own lane with the purpose of killing the opponents with an unfair advantage e.g. 3 versus 2) or stealing jungle camps, or pushing another lane. Example Mages would be: Karthus, Lux and Katarina. Example Assassins would be: Kha’zix, Zed, and Akali


* **Jungler** – The Jungler for a team will not be going to a lane, they will be killing neutral camps in the areas between the lanes known as the jungle, hence their name. Their main role is to create a huge amount of pressure on as many lanes as possible and the enemy Jungler, although the laners must remember, it is not the Jungler's job to win their lanes for them. A Jungler should be able to duel well enough, so that if they meet the enemy Jungler they can defeat him or send him packing. This champion will usually be able to sustain themselves, meaning that they will not go low on health or mana so that they can gank lanes accordingly, they should also be able to pressure dragons and baron using their smite ability, which deals an amount of true damage, based on their current level, to a neutral minion or monster. Example Jungle Champions are: Nasus, Volibear, and Hecarim


* **The Bruiser or Tanky Mage** – This person will be sitting alone in the top lane of the map, they are usually a champion that can sustain well on their own and scale well with levels or experience. The main aim of the top lane is to farm and create pressure on the enemy team’s Jungler, to force him to your lane instead of elsewhere, or in simpler terms, to waste the Jungler’s time. This champion occasionally has to fight a 2 versus 1 lane, this usually happens when a team has an AD carry who only wants to farm for the late game, and not have to face the enemy AD carry, in this case the top laner must be able to survive and farm from a distance while not getting caught out and killed. Top laners can occasionally perform a tactic known as Split pushing, this is the act of pushing your laner hard and putting pressure on the enemy team to come and deal with you, most split pushers will take teleport or have a way in which they can react and help their team if the enemy tries to fight them 4 versus 5. Also sometimes teams will send an Ability power champion to the top lane, this is generally used in the common Double AP strategy, and they will still play the same way as bruisers, but will use magical damage and build to be Tanky while still causing damage. Example Top laners that can shove are: Renekton, Darius, and Yorick. Example Top laners that can split push are: Shen, Singed, and Nidalee. Example Tanky AP top laners are: Vladimir, Swain, and Rumble


So now you have all this information, you may still not understand what all of this means? Well, let me put this information into an example that I am sure a lot of people can relate to, and that is a Family.


* **Top, The Older Brother:** This is the older brother, he has already left home and does not require much from his family, he will occasionally call for his father to come from to see him and give him whatever he needs or assist him, he does not often see the rest of the family until much later, where he is reunited with them.


* **Jungle, The Father:** Being the man of the family, the Father will be going to all of his family and giving them as much help as he can to allow them to gain an advantage and win their lane, later he will secure objectives for his family to make sure that they can thrive effectively.


* **Mid, The Independent Sister:** She’s pretty, smart and insists she has her own life. The Sister wants to live away from her family, but cares too much for them, she will occasionally require help from her dad, and try to help out her mother and younger brother in the bottom lane, occasionally she gets into scrappy fights with the enemy in her lane, but later she will show her family what she can really do.


* **AD Carry, The Younger Sibling:** he is not very smart, nor is he very strong, he still hangs around with his mum, while he tries to earn money and training to become like his older brother. Later after earning enough money, he will surpass his older brother and sister, and become the man he was mean to be, still easily slapped aside however; he will rely on his family to defend him so that he can reach his full potential.


* **Support, the Mother:** Looking after her youngest child, the mother will keep him safe under any circumstances. She puts up nightlights to keep the evil people at bay so her son may earn a living to become a real man, scaring away the enemies in her lane and making sure he has an easy time is her main objective, later she will try to keep her entire family safe, even if that means putting herself in danger for them.


So here is our Family, only together can they win a game, not shouting hurtful things at each other. Staying friendly with them is the best way to achieve victory in Summoner’s rift! So go out there and be the best family you can!

This means you can spam your sightstone wards in all the choke-points you are near. Whenever you move to a new area of the map place a ward in a choke. Or whenever an enemy could be over a wall, ward it.

This gives you an area around you where you have vision, and a huge advantage in random map awareness.

Huzz Here - I am a platinum Mid player who has recently decided to make youtube videos to aid people in LoL. Over the last Week ive posted a fair amount of my video's to help people from this sub Reddit. They've been received fairly well.

I was wondering if this subreddit would want maybe a weekly series where people may send me game replays and I could show some common mistakes people make. Any ELO but I know a fair amount of people are interested in gaining ELO from Bronze / Silver.

Let me know and I shall get it done. If I do use your replay I will note I will not be harsh or disrespectful to you in any way. These videos are meant for people to learn and aid them.

Anyway hope people have their say in this topic as it will be appreciated! My youtube channel is www.youtube.com/huzzygames  If you like any of my videos please feel free to subscribe, like and share!

EDIT: Thanks for the response everyone! Remember for these to happen I will need replays! Either record them and upload to a place I can view/ download it or... If you want to send me the LoLreplay file which I would prefer so I can have free control of the camera please upload the file to http://www.leaguereplays.com  its the best website to use for this purpose.

I ask him to buy a couple of wards and help out, in which the entire team laughs, calls me an idiot, and tells me that only the support should be warding. I ask the other team about it, and they also have the same reaction.


tl;dr - If you're at the shop, buy a ward or two, even outside of the laning phase.

INA Aurelius here again with another guide for you all! Just trying to help out the general LoL community, help people learn and understand the fundamentals of League of Legends, cause League is a game based off entirely on game mechanics, i.e. DMG output, champion familiarity, game phases, objectives, etc., and to help the newbies out to the gaming scene. 

As you may remember me from my last guide, ""What we learn from Recommended Champions,"" this time, I'll be writing about How to play Mid Lane. 

 * If you haven't seen my last guide, you aught to check it out, for I believe it's a worthwhile read, here is the link below:

http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19e9tj/what_we_learn_from_recommended_champions/

To **clarify** on the point of this guide:

I'm writing it to help out anyone new to playing Mid Lane, anyone wanting to play Mid Lane, but is not quite sure on how to, and even people who main with a champion in Mid Lane and just wishes to get better at it. I hope you all enjoy this guide, as much as I do writing it, so I may, to the best of my knowledge, to explain what and what not to-do when playing Mid Lane.

**Mid Lane - The Basic Fundamentals**

 * **Your Role in the Team Composition** - Depending on whether you're playing as an AD mid laner or, more traditionally, an AP mid laner, your essential role 
in a 5v5 team composition is to be a primary source of whatever DMG you scale off of, whether that be AD or AP, which has given to the title for most mid laners ""AP Carry or Secondary AD Carry."" 

 * **What Champions can be played in Mid Lane**

When you ask what champions can be played in mid lane, Riot would most likely say ""You can play anyone Mid Lane, cause we encourage to not have a meta."" Although this may be theoretically true, there are some champions that just don't belong in Mid Lane, e.g. Leona or Rammus mid?, so one might ask, what champions do? Since there are A LOT of champions, I'll do and explain a general breakdown of the **types** of champions, to the best of my knowledge, that can be played in Mid Lane. (Also, if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thanks ahead.)

 * *""All-In"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Katarina, Riven, Kayle, etc. This type of champion is very ""bursty"" in his/her combos, and generally have a kit aimed to allow him/her to make successful dives for you, when you're under your tower w/o much threat from tower-aggro, and get out unscathed thanks to either his/her resistances, high HP, or good escapes.  

 * *The ""Nukers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Annie, Malzahar, LeBlanc, Syndra, etc. This type of champion has some close similarities to the ""All-In"" Mid Laners in DMG output, but lack the kit to make ""safe"" tower dives. They generally rely on simply out-bursting you with his/her kit, much too fast for you to even respond to it. Although they generally have insane DMG output, they are regarded as the most squishy of all Mid Laners, due to their lack of resistances, escapes, and HP.

 * *The ""Teamfighters""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Morgana, Orianna, Zyra, etc. This type of champion is categorized for his/her amazing CC potential for teamfights. Although they may not be the best candidate for upfront 1v1s, they excel in 
their roles as an AP/AD Carry in teamfights thanks to his/her kit. They are also known for their zoning capabilities during laning phase, yet rarely dive an enemy underneath his/her tower for a kill, unless with the help of his/her jungler. 

 * *The ""Duelist""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Jarvan IV, Diana, Kayle, Zed, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her DPS potential and the general idea that he/she can take some punishment for a kill, i.e. tower diving, very aggressive zoning, etc. 

 * *The ""Roamers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Twisted Fate, Evelynn, Katarina, Nidalee, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to push his/her lane extremely quickly and then leave to go gank other lanes. They are best known for their highly successful ganking potential, e.g Twisted Fate's Destiny&gt;Gold Card or Katarina's Q&gt;E&gt;W&gt;R, that can help that particular lane ""snowball"" ahead the enemy laner. 

 * *The ""Secondary AD Carry""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include ANY AD Carry. Although you may not see this as often as you used to during Season 1 and early Season 2, you may still stumble upon this type of Mid Laner. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to ""bully"" the enemy laner with just AAs thanks to his/her range. 

 * *The ""Play for Late"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Karthus, Anivia, Mordekaiser, Cassiopeia, etc. This type of champion is categorized by the simply idea that they do not need kills to be successful, although not-dying is important as well, relying on just ""farming for late game"" holds true in this type of champion's strategy. They are generally item dependent on their DMG, but are devastating once those items are acquired. 

Those are the main categories, from my analysis, of all the types of champions that can be played in Mid Lane. Again,  if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thank you again.

**How does the Mid Lane laning phase differ from that of other lanes?**

The differences between Mid lane versus Top and/or Bot lane, include:

 * The distance of the enemy and allied towers from one another, i.e. allowing you to not run as far to escape a gank if you overextend, unlike that of Top or Bot. 

 * The distance of the towers behind the 1st tower, this makes farming behind the 1st tower difficult, if you wish to ""get ahead"" of your enemy laner, since the tower ranges overlap one another. 

 * Bushes are placed on either side of you making ""bush-ganks"" less common for you if you play safely away from them. 

 * You have access to both sides of both jungles, allowing you to help your Jungler counter jungle, take your or your enemy's Wraith camps, etc., which means that a little responsibility is put upon you when it comes to the jungle since you have access to either. 

 * You have access to both entrances to the river, allowing you to gank either Top or Bot lane, helping that lane ""snowball"" ahead to victory. 

 * You are a Solo lane, meaning that you will generally be of higher levels than that of Bot lane and Jungle, have more gold, and more CS. 

 * Your lane may be ganked more often than other lanes, due to it's convenient location of being the Middle of the map, so be wary of that. 

 * You have the responsibility, others too, but you mainly, of keeping and eye out for the following areas: Mid Lane mias, Purple and Blue side ramps to Wraiths, Side bushes, and (sometimes) enemy blue buff spawn times. 

**Ganking as a Mid Laner**

Ganking as a Mid Laner is sometimes risky, for if you die, you'll not only get behind on CS and gold, but may potentially snowball an enemy lane, so knowing when to gank as a Mid Laner is key. At least one of these criteria must be met (although not always) if you wish to go gank another lane: 
 
 * If you have pushed your lane to the enemy tower, you may consider leaving lane to go gank either Top or Bottom, or even to go counter jungle a bit.

 * If you've ""forced"" your enemy laner out of lane and back to Base. 

 * If you've been ganked by the enemy jungler and enemy mid laner and kill either one of them, with either the help of your jungler or by yourself, and have either enough pots to heal back up or just have enough HP left over to make a successful gank. 

 * If one of your teammates is forced to tower-hug AND the enemy laner of your teammate has no ward coverage as they overextend. 

 * If you have a large lead against the enemy mid laner and cannot be hurt much if you leave lane and miss CS and gold. 

 * Your enemy mid laner is missing or if you killed them and are ""healthy"" enough for a successful gank.  

*How-To Gank (tips)*

 * Ping that you are on your way, to catch you ally's attention.

 * Ask if any brush/river is warded. 

 * Wait for the perfect opportunity is which you can guarantee a kill, think before you do, patience is key to successful ganks. 

 * Learn to save your dashes/blinks/Flash/etc. for when the enemy uses his/her's. Most cases, if you play it correctly and depending on your kit, you won't need to use those and can save them for escaping during potential counter-ganks, or ""bad"" allied plays. 

 * Sometimes, giving up on a potential gank is better than ganking and letting your teammate die and the enemy laner escape. Know you DMG potential AND your teammate's DMG potential. Also, factor in how much HP your teammate has, how much HP the enemy laner has, the potential DMG output of the enemy laner, the location of the enemy jungler and mid laner. Remember, think before you do. ""Bad"" plays are generally made through poor decisions, which come from not thinking before he/she acts.

**The Importance of the Mid Lane tower**

 * The Mid lane towers are the most important among the ""Lane Towers,"" for it offers the team and the creeps the shortest route to the enemy base.

 * So having these down will definitely give you an advantage for if your creep wave is pushing into their base, then they either have to decide to either teamfight you and your team, or go back to go clear the wave, allowing you to get objectives, e.g Dragon, Baron, Buffs, other towers, etc., for almost free. 

 * ALTHOUGH, even though taking out the Mid Lane tower may give you and your team an advantage, it may be smarter to wait for a more opportune time to take it when you're at a higher level, i.e.  you need to save the tower so that you can receive creeps to farm off of, cause if the enemy mid lane tower is gone, you might have to overextend to get any CS or gold, putting you in a very vulnerable position. Communicate with your teammates to ensure nobody is ""missing out"" before the first tower falls. 

**What should I start with when I go Mid Lane?**

 Your choices are:

 * *Boots &amp; 3x Pots* - This is a recommended start for anyone who is up against any enemy champion that relies of skillshots for his/her DMG output. And the 3x HP Pots are a grace given to you for some sustain if you do happen to get hit by a skillshot. This start may be skipped if your Rune Page has 3x Quintessences of MS, but that is entirely up to you, remember, that extra MS might help you catch someone out of position, catch someone when invading during early game, dodge more skillshots, or outrun your opponent if you get caught. 

 * *9x HP Pots &amp; 2 Green Sight Wards* - This is a start that is taken when you are aiming to simply out sustain your opponent, allowing you to get an advantage on him.her in terms of Gold, CS, and levels. This is generally taken with champions that benefit from not having a mana Resource for his/her abilities, e.g. Katarina, Riven, Akali, etc., this n=does not have to limit the champions that do use mana for you can just simply trade in 4x HP Pots for 4x Mana Pots instead. Again, this is just for out-sustaining your opponent. 

 * *Cloth Armor &amp; 5x HP Pots* - Although this is more commonly taken for Top Lanes or was taken for junglers back in Season 2, you may still take these starting items for Mid Lane if your opponent is AD heavy. It offers good sustain and resistances against any AD opponent. This is deemed a ""safe"" start if you are unaware of the enemy AD laner's skill with the champion, potential DMG output, and if you don't feel confident playing against this particular champion.

 * *4x HP Pots &amp; 1x Fortitude Pot* - This is taken for only two reasons: One. You are planning to be excessively aggressive and are playing an AD champion, thanks to your starting items, you can be aggressive, deny the enemy laner from farm, while healing up on any trade backs, if any. 

 * *Doran's Ring or Doran's Blade* - These starting item allows you to stay in lane for a very long time, IF you are playing ""safe,"" meaning not overextending, harassing to deny CS from the enemy laner, staying behind your creep to avoid getting hit by skill shots, etc. An ok  item to start with, if you only wish to farm and be passive, but does not offer the same bonuses as other starting items and vice-verse.

 * *Tome &amp; 1x HP/Mana Pot or Sword &amp; 2x HP Pots* - A poor choice, for the amount of AP/AD received is countered by the amount of sustain it provides you. You may take this if you are confident on the ability to out-DMG and out-sustain your enemy laner. 

 * *Crystalline Flask &amp; 3x HP Pots/Crystalline Flash &amp; 1x Green Ward &amp; 1x Pot* - This is generally taken for heavy sustain early on, and thanks to the ""free"" refills of Crystalline Flask, it is deemed an extremely cost efficient item. So starting with either of these is an good option for sustaining in lane to acquire CS, Gold, and levels.

 * *Fairy Charm &amp; 1x Green Ward &amp; 6x HP/Mana Pots* - Another option for mana users who know that they will rely on his/her mana-cost abilities to farm, Allows the player to stay in lane for a fair amount of time w/o going back to Base to ""refill"" his/her Crystalline Flask or to buy more pots. May sometimes out sustain those that start with 9x HP Pots &amp; 2x Green Wards, if you have some spell vamp.

I've tried to spell everything out as clear as possible for everyone to benefit from, even those who already play ranked or those not yet ready to play ranked.** Without further ado:

Hey guys! This is my second guide I've posted here, the first was about meta-breaking champions. This one focuses on ranked games, and mainly those just started playing ranked. My IGN is beyondthefray117, and I'm currently Silver II [My Kassad.in page] (http://quickfind.kassad.in/profile/na/beyondthefray117/). I've climbed up from Bronze III in 180 games, and hopefully I'll climb into Gold by the end of the summer. I main support (crazy, right?), and I've picked up a few things about lower ELOs. These can apply to all ranked games but definitely more applicable to lower ELO levels.

But before we start, **Why play ranked?** Ranked provides higher rewards for winning, and it just makes you feel a lot more satisfied winning a ranked game than a normal. That being said, losing is more frustrating and more upsetting than normals.

Other perks:

* Summoner Icons
* Colored Banners/Loading Screen Borders
* Victorious Skin (That's why I want to get to gold)
* Bragging Rights with friends
* Get better at the game, if you know what goes wrong.

if you're really new, here's the rundown on the terms I'm using.

* CC - Crowd control. Slows, stuns, fears, etc.
* ELO - Your rating. It is not an acronym, it's named after the creator of the system, Aroad Elo.
* Gank - ambush
* Flame - rage at something/someone
* CS - Creep score. The number of minions you as an individual kill.
* DoT - Damage over Time. Spells like Ignite, Red buff, and Spirit of the Lizard Elder's passive are examples of DoT.
* AA - Auto Attacks. Basic attacks that are done with right clicks.  

And without further ado, here's the main points people need to work on in low ELOs.
***
Teamwork - People in low ELOs flame. Hard. If you flame, that's fine. 

[This] (http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2EB9D1C236F6274) is what I listen to when I stream or play ranked games. It helps me relax and just have fun. This is Badministrator, he'a a League rapper and I think he does an awesome job with his songs. [Mobile friendly version] (http://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2EB9D1C236F6274)

Still, keep flaming to yourself. Don't type it in. Only type in what will help your team. There's really not much to say about this, so I'll jump into my example.

A few days ago I played with an excellent Ezreal. He was 10/1 at 20 minutes and was just playing well. I was support Nami. At one point I tried to zone the opponents by being aggressive to get Ez some free farm. They called my bluff and I died. Instead of getting mad at me, he just said ""Nami, don't do that"" to which I replied, ""my bad, sorry."" Although Ez was being flamed by out Zyra about how blue Ez is terrible now, he didn't yell at me, and it made me just upset at myself, not him, and so I changed up my gameplay and didn't die for the rest of the game.

Another part of teamwork is communication. Marking timestamps on Dragon, Baron, and vital ward spots (where they pink when you don't have any pinks, lane brush that blocks lane ganks), blue, and red buffs are very important. As a jungler, you should be paying attention to where they ward and noting when the laners tell you where and ping. This also includes letting your team know who is picking up the Aegis/Locket or other aura items.

PROTIP: Turn on ""Show Timestamps"" in the More Options to easily stamp dragons and barons, and know how recent MIA pings were. 

Not just timestamps, but also coordinating strategies is also important. If you've got a Malphite, he should be doing the engaging, not you. If you have an Orianna, she should use E (shield) on Malph first and ult after he ults. I know this sounds very specific, but over time (if you're new) you'll figure out which characters should do the engage, and it's usually ""catch-you-by-surprise"" gap closer. Leona, Malph, Amumu, Zac, Ori, Ahri (Charm), Varus, and Ashe are some of the many that can engage fights well. These all have blink abilities or hard CC. Let them engage, not your Vayne or Caitlyn. This sounds crazily obvious, but it's amazing how many players, especially near Bronze V-III, don't let their tanks engage fights. I watch my good friend play (he's Bronze IV), and it's just crazy how many times I see the mid going in way past their front line to poke at their full team, only to get jumped on and destroyed. **Work with your teammates. Always**. It's not worth giving up just because your teammate is a jerk.
***
Last Hitting - Yep, of course this is on the list. But if we say it so many times, maybe it will actually stick. It's so vital. Really. I watch my friend's game and I see 20-30 CS on the ADCs at 10 minutes, and I'm wondering how that's even possible. It's simple, really - they're focusing on poking down their opponents rather than picking up CS, and this is a great way to beat your opponents - gold. Just don't die to their poke and outfarm (basically attack back to get them off of you when they go for you, but don't play too aggressive yourself). Then, on your first back, you can outbuy the other ADC and go for an all-in on them. If you play it correctly, you can pick up a kill or two. If you still don't think you can take them (CS lead isn't high enough, jungle might gank, etc), then continue farming, but maybe you can be more aggressive this time, show your presence further. Poke safely and focus on CS. **You will win lanes by CSing. Killing helps, but doesn't win it.** 

(This is a bot lane scenario. This works for top and mid too) If you are ADC, and the enemy ADC is killed or back, IE the lane is clear of danger (you have enough health to not get destroyed by the jungler), always shove your lane. Push and CS. This accomplishes two things - (1) as your enemy ADC runs to lane, you will have more gold to spend when you back giving you the advantage, and (2) the enemy tower will kill the minions and not the ADC, denying XP and farm.

Here's a game I read on this sub that I stole as a great way to improve last hitting - Play ADC, have a partner (maybe your DuoQ support, friend, or anyone really that will agree). This partner plays support. The ADC must get:

* Easy - 100 CS in 15 minutes
* Difficult - 85 CS in 10 minutes

The support cannot go past his farthest minion. The support has to stop his CSing as best they can OR kill the ADC. The ADC must reach the listed CS numbers above.

This not only teaches CSing, but CSing under pressure, and this is what bronze players struggle with quite a bit. And Silver players as well, just to a lesser extent.

** If you are 5/0 with 0 CS you will lose to someone 0/0 with 100 CS. Yes, farming is that important**.
***
Runes - DO NOT start ranked without runes. If you have two pages only, that's fine. Use the ADC page and the Mid page, or, frankly, whatever position you play most. But you should have one for AP and one for AD.

On the rune page, Marks are Red, Seals are Yellow, Glyphs are Blue, Quints are the large thingies.

* ADC - 9x Flat AD Marks, 9x Flat Armor Seals, 9x Scaling MR Glyphs (Flat if you are facing poke supports, or if you're cheap because flat MR is for your Mid page too), and 2x Lifesteal Quints and 1x Flat AD Quints. You can also run 3x LS Quints if you want, too.
* Mid - 9x Hybrid Pen Marks (these are expensive as hell, you could buy Magic pen marks if you have to), 9x Flat Armor Seals, 9x Flat MR Glyphs, and 3x Flat AP Quints OR 3x Movespeed Quints

If you roam a lot as mid, take the movespeed quints. If not, opt for the flat AP.

* Support - 9x Flat Armor Marks, 5x Flat Armor And 4x Gold per 10 Seals, 9x Flat/Scaling MR (depends on matchup), 1x Flat Health and 2x Gold per 10.

This page gives armor to counter their ADC in lane, MR to face their mid or poke support, and, when paired with a Philo stone and the proper masteries, that's 10 gold per 10. That's a lot of bonus income to spend on wards.

ALTERNATE OPTION: Take 9x Flat Armor Seals instead of having only 5x. And take 3x GP/10 Quints. Same amount of GP/10, more armor, and 26 less health.

* Jungle/AD Mid - Take your same ADC page and give it Movespeed Quints. AD assassins could also benefit from the ADC page.

***
Roles - You should never be the one saying ""top or feed"". You should know every role well enough to play it ranked or regular, and yes, bronze players, this means learning and playing support. Rule of thumb is to have a few characters in each lane that you're comfortable with, and usually ones that have different strengths/weaknesses so you can't be counterpicked.

For example, here's my champion pool:

* Top - Cho, Rammus, Quinn, Riven, Jayce, Zed, Shen
* Jungle - Cho, Rammus, Yi, Vi, Zac
* Mid - Veigar, Zyra, Lux, Zed, Heimerdinger, Xerath, Nidalee, Annie
* Support - Everyone. Hehe. But I play mostly Zyra, Lulu, Taric, Leona, Nami, and Sona.
* ADC - Cait, Ezreal, Quinn, Miss Fortune, and 100% never Draven (even before he was Olafed)

Those are the characters I feel comfortable playing in ranked games. You should have at least two, preferably three for each role. And no, Nidalee is not a valid support.

*Let's take a break to defend my ""shots fired"" comment about Nid support. If Nid builds classic support, so Ruby SS, Mobility boots, a Philo, and Wards, her heals do nothing and her spears do no damage. If Nid builds AP her spears do some more damage but still not a significant amount because Nid won't be getting CS. Also Nid sacrifices basically any ward coverage and this means free barons, dragons, and ganks for the opposing team. Now, back on topic.*

It is NOT wrong to have one or two preferred roles at all, it's just wrong to not be able to adapt to other roles.

**Pick characters you are good with, not characters that are ""OP"" or ""broken""**. I cannot stress this enough - everything is viable in SoloQ. Veigar's only got a 44% win rate according to lolking? Who cares? I'm 9-4 on him. Soraka is a terrible support? I'm 4-0 on her. Amumu is OP? I'm 1-3 on him. If you believe you're good on a character, than play them. Do not use websites like ChampionSelect to pick a character you've never played before. Every character sucks if you can't play them correctly. 
***
Champion Select - Pay attention! Draft Pick is very different than blind pick. 3 bans and alternating picks.

Bans - Common bans are as follows in low ELOs:

* Bronze - Malphite, Amumu, Blitz, Shen, Thresh
* Silver - Amumu, Blitz, Thresh, Nunu, Vayne, Twisted Fate, Elise, and occasionally Zac.
* At high ELOs, Vayne, Thresh, Nunu, and Twisted Fate are the most commonly banned.

Let's say you're ADC and 4th pick. The enemy ADC picks Ashe. Going to ChampionSelect says that Ezreal is strongest against Ashe. You should not instalock Ez for the sole reason he beats Ashe. Play Ez only if you are very confident of your ability on him. 

An example of falling into the trap of this was my brother the other day. He's a Bronze II ADC/Mid player and faced a Morgana. He played Talon, even though I haven't seen him play Talon in a really long time. He should have played a comfort pick of his like Vlad, because Vlad also happens to do well against Morgana. 

Another note: [Look at ChampSelect's view on Ashe] (http://www.championselect.net/champ/Ashe). What do you see? It says that Cait is both strong and weak against Ashe, and both with more upvotes than downvotes. This is just a knock to the credibility of the site.

*So can I ever use this website for counters?* Yes, you can. I suggest, however, using it to choose who NOT to pick rather than who to pick. This means if they lock Graves and you're ADC, don't pick Ezreal. I say this for two reasons: (1) If he picks graves before your ADC is picked, he probably feels most comfortable on Graves. Putting yourself on Ez puts yourself at a disadvantage. Of course, any lane can be won by simply good play (in low ELOs especially).

Ez is sort of a poor example because he doesn't really have any super hard counters thanks to his Arcane Shift, but that's not my point.
***
Summoner Spells - Why is this a topic? Because I see a lot of low bronze players taking summoners that put them at a disadvantage. Usage is also very important. But first, here are the standard summoner spells per lane.

*Spells are in order of importance. Please note that some champions (champions with no ranged abilities) work better with Ghost than Flash, including Hecarim, Udyr, Nocturne, and Nasus.*

* Top - Flash &gt; Teleport &gt; Exhaust &gt; Ignite &gt; Ghost. Top lane is isolated from all other lanes, so it makes sense to take teleport. This opens opportunities to back earlier without missing a wave, gank lanes, and keep global pressure. A lot of people can't deal with split pushers in low ELOs so taking teleport and creating pressure elsewhere can draw a lot of people on the enemy team, opening up the chance for your team to take other objectives while the opposing team is in limbo. Flash is pretty self explanitory. Exhaust will win you a duel if your damage output is sufficient. Usually is used best to force flashes.
* Mid - Flash &gt; Ignite &gt; Teleport=Barrier. Ignite is to add to your high damage output, reducing sustain Mid laners and a nice DoT to help you offensively. Teleport allows you to gank or get to lane faster (see the long paragraph above about teleport for a more in depth explanation) , and barrier works best against burst mages like Annie and Veigar that can take you down fast, but don't do much after their burst is over. Flash is practically mandatory here.
* Jungle - Smite &gt; Flash/Ghost &gt; Ignite. The reason Flash and Ghost didn't get the equals sign here is because they shouldn't be of equal importance, but rather picked always based on the jungler. Above it explains that some characters lie Udyr and Nasus go better with Ghost than they do Flash, so Ghost is more preferable. Ignite is only on the list because it's an aggressive option because it leaves you with no summoner for escaping, but it's doable, just not the best.
* ADC/Marksman - Flash &gt; Barrier &gt; Cleanse &gt; Ignite. Barrier is better than Ignite nowadays because it really wins duels for you. You're 15 health under your tower and the enemy ADC is 250 health. He dives your tower, you AA and pop barrier. Bam. You just punished him/her badly for being too aggressive. Ignite is less preferable because Barrier + AAs deals more damage than Ignite's DoT.
* Support - Flash &gt; Exhaust. No options for you in support, or you're a S1 groupie rollin' with Clairvoyance.  It's simple. You get into a skirmish, you exhaust the ADC, and that will really help tip the scales in your favor. Flash because otherwise escaping will be near impossible, as most likely you'll be underleveled and squishy.

**Usage of Summoners** - more advanced part. As I spectate my Bronze IV friend, I notice that lower ELO players blow their Summoners very quickly. Here's a quick rundown on how to use each spell.

* Flash - you probably should be taking this every game so I'll go for it first. Flash is a defensive spell, and should be used for that primarily. I saw three or four flashes directly into enemy tower range in the two games I spectated yesterday in Bronze IV. And most of the times, the ADC that flashed died, wasting the spell, XP, and farm over the other ADC that used barrier under their tower. Tip 1: Use flash offensively only when absolutely necessary (such as your team is engaging a fight at dragon and flashing in is the only way you can get damage down). Another rule of thumb for offensive flashes is only use it when you both know you can secure the kill this way AND you cannot get it otherwise. In defensive situations, flash away from CC abilities that ensure your death (Zac Slingshot, J4 EQ combo, Nami bubble) or flash over walls. This counters those who take ghost. Another point about defensive flashes though - you don't have to use it every time it's up. If you are playing Cait or Ezreal, try to get away using E (90 Caliber net and Arcane Shift, respectively) before using flash. I see a ton of people in low Bronze flashing away from a jungle gank when they have full health. It's not always necessary to flash.
* Teleport - I very rarely get to play toplane, but when I do, teleport is a ton of fun to use. I use it for backdooring, getting back to lane, and ganking. To start with ganking, I instruct the friendly support to pink ward the lane brush closest to the enemy tower, in the middle or more towards their tower. Then after the ward is cleared and they are being pushed back, I teleport in and surprise them from behind. This works even better with your jungle ganking as well, but it's not necessary. Ping to engage and rush in, but be careful not to get too far into the fight, as the enemies are very likely to burn flash and if you get into melee range then they have a chance to escape. You can also use teleport to counter split pushers. If everyone's mid except for one enemy almost at the top tower, you can protect your tower, pick up farm, and thwart their efforts, especially if your team is tunnel visioning (when they are so focused in their lane that they just ignore other spots on the map.
* Ignite - this is a spell I see misused all the time im Bronze V-III. Ignite does two things: reduces healing by 50% and applies true damage over time based on current level. So how do we use it? At Bronze V-III I see something all the time that I refer to as ""Ignite harass"". This is a term I coined in S1 (where I called ""poke"" ""harass"" still) when someone uses Ignite for no reason, usually doing nothing. **Ignite is a finisher.** If your opponents have no source of healing, ignite at 20% health or lower to help secure a kill. The exceptions to this rule are characters like Volibear, Aatrox, and Nidalee that have healing abilities, and in this case Ignite should be used to power through these abilities and guarantee your victory in the duel/fight.
* Barrier - Most likely you're playing ADC if you're taking this spell, so I'll mostly go over that. But against burst mages use barrier when they start getting their combo off (Annie hits her stun, Veigar EWQ combo). This (if they're not too fed) should help you soak up the burst and be able to plant some of your own damage down in retaliation. In the ADC role, Barrier is a spell for winning duels. Most of the time in duels ADCs are hitting at each other, both supports have used exhaust, and the supports are closer to the enemy ADC over their own because they're trying to get all the CC and damage they can onto their target. Barrier will give enough of a shield to hopefully take the lead in the trade and secure you a kill. Use it in duels, use it when you're getting dived under the tower, use it when you would otherwise die. Just don't use it too early because it doesn't last that long (for things like Cait's ult or Karth's ult).
* Smite - This is a spell that I seem to have a ton of trouble using correctly myself. I usually spam it in the jungle, and it usually ends up biting me later. To start the game, always take the BOTTOM buff first. This means red buff on blue side, blue buff on purple side. Make sure this is a smiteless leash. Then go to your other buff next, use smite and clear it yourself. This sets you up to gank top early. You should have a level on the laners and it's likely they do not have wards yet. If you and the top laner are on the same page, that can be a quick first kill. Then you can clear your smaller creeps, gank mid, or back. Or all three. Back to smite. There's times where using smite is perfectly fine in lane or in the jungle, but if you plan on ganking bot at levels 6-10, do not waste smite on the jungle, but rather wait to see if you can be successful in your gank bot, and go grab dragon. Smite secures this dragon for your team and blocks most steal attempts. Less risk via a faster clear, less damage taken, and less chance for the enemy to steal. This works the same with baron. On the other hand, keeping smite for steals is pretty important too. With proper warding by you and/or your support, you can left click on the target to find out its exact health, and time it with your smite for a good steal. I see very few steals at my ELO and none even when it's highly possible at low ELO. This may have to do with the lack of warding.
* Exhaust - This is always taken as a support, and occasionally taken as a top laner. I am going to just focus on using exhaust while playing support. There are three main scenarios where exhaust should be used: ADC targeted, chase, and duel. In ADC targeted, this is when your ADC is running away, usually back to the tower, and there's little damage being put onto you. If your ADC has a good amount of distance to still cover, or is somewhat low, this is a time to use exhaust. The slow will weaken their chase and the damage the ADC will put out is also dampened. This should allow your ADC to escape. Note that this is a decision that can be difficult to make, and making decisions like these usually come from experience. Nonetheless, you should note a few things before immediately popping exhaust, such as how close your ADC is to your tower, if they used their escape move (if they have one), if the enemy ADC used their gap closer (if they have one), etc. It's also important to NOT use exhaust when your ADC is below 5-10% health, usually. This is because exhaust probably won't provide enough damage reduction for your ADC to survive. Just try to block skillshots and use your CC as best you can to block and obstruct the enemy's assault. Another option is using exhaust primarily for its slow, AKA the chase. This when all of your CC is blown and you don't think you will be able to get the opponent otherwise. It allows your ADC to land more autos, more damage, and makes it easier to hit skillshots, which ultimately can net more kills. The final option is the duel. This usually occurs when both ADCs are confident in their ability to win a fight, and usually neither is too far ahead of each other. Exhaust can basically win the lane here if you get it onto the ADC before their main burst damage comes off, such as MF QR or Graves EQR. Sometimes getting up to the ADC to hit exhaust is hard before these spells get off, but for the most part, any time where the ADC is exhausted in a duel where they cannot hide immediately behind their turret, forcing them to die or flash, exhaust has been used correctly. If you are the ADC and you get exhausted, I like to try to retreat to an unwarded brush (with a Cait E or a Graves E), and when they chase in, hit my combo and use barrier to make up for the losing trade I most likely just had due to exhaust.

Yes, summoner spells are worth such a massive blurb like this.
***
Trading - Trading is a pretty advanced topic, but I'll go over it because it is super important. Trading is NOT the same kind as trading in TF2 (shitty jokes ftw), but rather when someone puts damage down onto another champion.

[Here is a great lesson on ADC mechanics and trading that should have been sidebarred a while ago] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=6ywhB-2h2AE)

[Mobile friendly version] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6ywhB-2h2AE)

Trading is fighting your opponent, usually in lane. Generally it involves both sides planting damage down, but not always. Trading is most effective when you are not losing CS while doing more damage to your opponent. Minions can play a big part of this at low levels.

The ""Trading stance"" (explained in great detail in the video) is where you wait for the enemy to go up for a CS, and while they are autoing you auto them and maybe use an ability. This ensures they cannot retaliate because they just used an auto, giving you enough time to retreat (the best way to position yourself to get the damage on time is to ""stand on the dying minion."" This means be right near the minion that the enemy wants to kill. This should allow you to: (1) poke them down low enough that you can all-in them, or (2) make them afraid of CSing in your presence. Both are very optimal. Big warning though - *do not sacrifice your own CS to do this.* If you do not CS yourself and spend all your time poking, especially without kills, then you starve yourself without really knowing it. You may *feel* like you're winning lane, but in reality you may have the same amount of gold that your opponent does.

Another important part of trading is capitalizing on enemy mistakes. In a normal game I played yesterday, I played Shen against a Lee Sin. He started off doing okay, around 10 CS behind me (54 to 44), but made his big mistake when he tried to outtrade me. No minions of mine were really low, so he hits his Q and jumps in. I retreat to my minion wave, and when he jumps in, I fight him. I know I have the advantage with my minions all targeting him, and he didn't put out too much damage. I use Q, W, and hit a Ki strike and he lost the trade badly. He backed off and I got free farm. I forced him to back and from there I stomped lane. I ended the game with 330 CS (and 10/3) and he ended the game with 120 CS (and 4/5). I snowballed without a kill, just by winning a trade that forced him to play defensive for the rest of the laning phase, granting me free farm and a big advantage (Note: I didn't try anything to augment my damage output in my build, just hybrid pen marks and flat AP quints)

Basically the point my story above is saying that at low levels, extending into the enemy minion wave is one of the biggest mistakes that can happen. Either minions take aggro and that's a big buff for you in the trade, or the enemy retreats back to safety and hopefully you can land some free autos.
***
Warding - Yeah, this is very important. Vision is vital so you know where your enemies are (and aren't) so you can make plays accordingly, like dragon, pushing towers, or engaging fights.

**Every role should have wards**, even ADC. Usually ADCs should only buy one ward at a time, to use for facechecking brushes or warding vital spots (tribrush, dragon) when the support is not in lane. As support, you should be warding a lot more than that. In the Bronze IV games I watch I play a game called ""ward off"", where I count which team has more wards than the other every 5 or so minutes. The most wards I have ever seen is 4 to 1 in favor of the purple team. Usually it is 1 to 0 or 1 to 1, with 0 wards on dragon or baron. Supports - if you have a Sightstone, USE IT! It's free. This drives me crazy to see no ward coverage and watch carries get caught out really badly. 

Wards also will let your team know when the enemies take dragon or baron, and if you cannot contest on your own, you will at least know exactly when it respawns.

So where do we ward? Most of the time, warding spots are situational. However, some spots should always be warding in laning phase. In post laning (or towards the end of laning), it can be a good idea to ward at enemy buff camps (blue mostly, but red works too if an ambush is set up accordingly). Remember the blue buffs will spawn at 1:55, ~7:15, ~12:30-13:00, and so on. Red and Blue buffs are on 5 minute spawn timers. All regular camps are 50 seconds. Dragon is 6 minutes, Baron is 7. This means a good time to ward the blue buff is around 5:00-5:30. This way, your ward should be alive for long enough to see the enemy try to take the buff. And, if your team is in position, a good time to catch off the mid which is probably in the banana brush or brush past that going in to take it. Or a classic smite steal, just to rub it in.

[Here] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=4L9NjOD570s) is a commonly recommended youtuber, Gbay99, with his video on where to ward. [Mobile friendly] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4L9NjOD570s)
***
Ranked Game Fears - You should never be afraid to play a ranked game. If it's scary, you're not going to perform the best you normally would anyway, and it leads into a negative cycle of hating/continuing to fear ranked games. In my opinion, I think ranked games can be more fun than normals because most of the time everyone wants to win. Goals are centered on playing good champions and winning games over trying out new strategies or learning new champions, and for me, I feel like when everyone's trying I can pinpoint what went wrong with the game and improve much more from my losses. 

If you are really afraid of ranked games, force yourself to play a few. At least get yourself placement matches (10 in SoloQ). Ranked games will not be for everyone, just like playing ARAMs, 3v3s (2-2 in our ranked promotion to Silver and we get placed vs. a Diamond 1 Blitz. We got destroyed), or Hide and Seek.  It's just the way the game goes. But I think every level 30 player should at least try playing ranked, or at least normal draft mode to get the same feel in a no-risk scenario (con is longer queue times in normal draft)
***
If you want to see me play a ranked game as support, [here] (http://www.twitch.tv/btf117/b/440663905) is one of my quite terrible streams of my Nami (I think I am 9/8 or 10/8 on her right now). The stream itself is pretty bad because it's difficult to hear me over my music, and my face is basically invisible because I play behind two windows. I played two ARAMs first in that stream (Veigar and Morgana) so you'll have to skip ahead to the 1:00:00 mark. I suggest also not watching some of my other stuff, I'm trying to clean it up but some content is really bad, or just nothingness. I'm new to streaming so I apologize for this.

Thank you so much for everyone that took the time to read this wall of text, it's taken me a very long time to write it all for you. If you like it please give it an upvote so that more people can see it, it's a self post so I get no karma (obviously), I just want my efforts to not go in Vayne (ba dum tiss). But seriously. This took a long time.

If you didn't like it, please let me know why. I always can use the criticism in order to better my guides.

**TL;DR: Ranked shouldn't be scary, it should be fun! Learn a few characters for each role, ward often, and don't be overly aggressive. Last hit (when applicable), do damage, and win games. Good luck summoners.**

P.S. I put quite a bit of basic information in here, so do you think that /r/SummonerPreschool would appreciate this guide?

1371505600.0,157,self.summonerschool,1gjkt5,Just had adc coaching with a Diamond I. Here is what I learned.,exeneva,171,14,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gjkt5/just_had_adc_coaching_with_a_diamond_i_here_is/,"Here's his lolking: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/eune/21795091#profile

We focused on a few matchups specifically. I'll post what he mentioned here.

**FOR ALL ADCs:**

* Shove lane if possible, but also get those last hits in. This creates a minion advantage if they are doing nothing but last hitting, meaning when you trade you will have more minion support. It also causes the wave to get to their tower, making it harder for them to last hit. Ganks become near-impossible if you are able to freeze the wave correctly, because there will be your massive minion wave between you and them (and their tower), so a jungler coming from the side can be intercepted easily.
* A good farmer is better than someone who gets kills every now and then. Gold-per-minute should be maximized, meaning if you are able to score a kill then go for it, but if not then focus on farming.
* Taking the enemy's bot tower before 10 minutes is often not a good idea. The enemy adc essentially gets free farm and can catch up if behind. Get dragon (if it's safe) if you kill them or make them recall at bot.
* If you are losing lane, the 'sustain farm' build is two Dorans Blades and a Vamp Scepter. Build into BortK or BT after this.


Matchup-specifics:

**VAYNE vs. CAITLYN**

* Caitlyn will push the lane, so Vayne has to autoattack minions to keep the wave from getting stuck under tower, which hurts her farm.
* Caitlyn doesn't have the best all-in capability, so Vayne at level 6 can attempt an all-in on Caitlyn. Caitlyn's best defense is to land E (hard when vayne is stealthed) to get away, then return to harass or reengage after Vayne ult wears off. NEVER fight vayne when she is ulting.
* Caitlyn needs to rush BortK against Vayne, because Cait with IE loses to Vayne with BortK if Vayne knows how to play. In fact, a Vayne with BortK can often dive Cait under tower and win. In our coaching session, I was 4/2 Caitlyn against Morrigan's 2/4 Vayne, but he had BortK and was able to dive me and secure the kill even when behind. This is because there is no way to escape from Vayne if she uses BortK active and steals your movement speed (combined with her passive and damage bonus from her ult). If you rush BortK against Vayne, you can steal her movement speed and escape until her ult goes on cd.
* Vayne only needs BortK and Last Whisper to do insane damage. Even if Vayne is 0/4 in lane, if she knows how to last hit and farm, Vayne will be a lategame threat with BortK and Last Whisper.

**EZREAL vs WHOEVER**

* Blue Ezreal is a very cost-effective build, meaning your focus needs to be on farming for the later game carry. It's very easy to last hit as ezreal, even under tower, due to Q.

* If you are against an aggressive adc like Cait or Draven, rush Tear of the Goddess for the infinite mana so you have no problems last hitting under turret.

* You should never die as ezreal in lane because you have E to escape. Focus on farming that cost-effective blue build while also not dying.

That's all I can remember from our coaching session. I'll try to record and upload the next one!",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1371574687.0,,,True,t3_1gjkt5,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gjkt5/just_had_adc_coaching_with_a_diamond_i_here_is/,

Stop saying you can't get out of elo hell because you always get the dumb people.

Because if you do, you'll never get out of the elo you're at. You'll never improve at this game. You can rage and report all you want, but you'll never climb the ladders.

I'm sick and tired of people giving me this excuse all the time. Since Season 2 is about to end soon, I've been spending quite some time to help some friends improve, including sitting down and going over their replays and offering them whatever advice I can.

And after a week of going back and forth at their certain elo, all of them come and complain to me ""I can't do it. I always get feeders and even if I win my lane and roam, I still lose. 
I go into a teamfight and no one follows.""

Look, I know ranked can be tough and some situations are clearly out of your control, but if you truly deserve to be at the elo you think you can be, you'll eventually get there, leavers, feeders, ragers, or whatever.

What NOT to do to get there is to blame others. YOU take responsibility for that death that gave them dragon and snowballed the game. YOU take responsibility for baiting your team into an ace. YOU take responsibility for the calls and the decisions you make in lane, whether they provide a positive or negative outcome. If you're truly good at League, then the decisions you make should be able to win you a victory every game despite feeder teammates or not.

Tl;Dr: STOP BLAMING OTHERS FOR THE RESULT OF YOUR GAMES. You have just as much of an impact on them as they do and played correctly, you can win a game. You can't control what other people do, but you can control WHAT YOU DO. I hate to use this as an example, but it's one reason why elo boosting is such a successful business, because truly skilled players are capable of winning almost every game lower than their elo.",[TIPS],False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,tips,default,True,t3_114dfs,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/114dfs/just_stop_it_stop_blaming_other_people/,

- You might not be able to win the lane but you never have to feed.

We've all seen that Lee Sin who types ""/ALL #INSEC MECHANICS!"" and then proceeds to give the enemy Darius double buffs trying to solo him at level 3. We've all had that mid lane Zed who insists that he counters Kassadin and then proceeds to die to him... again... and again... and again... 

So you picked Shen and the other top laner picked Kennen? GG? No. Start Doran's Shield, farm with your Q when you can, don't get too low on health, stay at your tower, and gtfo if he runs at you after hitting level 6. You might die once or twice and you might lose your tower too. Once it goes down you can freeze it at your second tower to catch up in CS. You can still become that late game tank and you avoided feeding a Kennen, whose ult could destroy your entire team mid game (if you fed him). 

So again, 

- You might not be able to win the lane but you never have to feed.

You might have to give up a lot of CS early on. You won't get to make plays early. You will probably lose your tower. But you can stay relevant and allow for the possibility of your team mates to do well. 

Your allied Vayne, no matter how skilled, cannot carry you if you feed and her lane doesn't feed her similarly. It's a team game and you can't always win it on your own. You can certainly lose it for your team though.

Meaning you have no vision on the map unless your unit is present.

I used to be in Masters League in Starcraft 2 before moving on to playing LoL. Artosis, the famous player-turned-commentator said this: ""Starcraft is a game of incomplete information. Players fight for vision. The more vision, the more information. The more information, the more correct actions you can make. And of course, the more correct actions you make, the more likely you are to win the game.""

Even though starcraft and LoL are two totally different beasts. I would say from my experience vision trumps all other builds/strategies in both games. (Well, in most cases, OP items/heroes who need nerfs don't count. You can just sit in the dark and build OP builds). 

I heard about people who map hack, got to Masters League in Starcraft and even beat pro players on 1v1 Ladder. They certainly don't have the skills, the reflexes, nor the knowledge of pro-players. Yet, these maphackers can still beat them. This proves just how important vision is. 

In LoL, wards provide vision. Proper (and sometimes even excessive warding) will be more rewarding than what a physical item can benefit you. I find a team that has more vision will be able to make better judgement, avoid traps, make better decisions and win fights even with weapons and armors that are worse off.

To me vision is King. Vision wins you games. Vision brings a team together.

The first time you see your opponent, the very first thing you should do is click on his champion and check his level one stats.

Imagine this: you're playing Lux against a Kassadin in mid.

But, if you have flat MR blues, you are currently stronger than him at level 1. You need to abuse this advantage now.

Another situation. You're Kennen top lane against a Riven. You click on her, and notice that she has a red pot in her inventory and 75 AD at level 1. **Run for your life you little gerbil.** Get your E at level 2 and when she bum rushes you, be ready to lightning rush away because she will kill you and it will suck.

My first Aikido teacher explained that this actually means ""move the same way all the time"".

Here's a thought: to improve at League, change focus from ""enjoy wins, and accept losses"" to ""win quickly, and lose slowly"". Or: ""when you have no advantage, play like you have one; when you have an advantage, play like you do not"". In a moment, I'll explain it in detail, but for now, keep in mind that the first part should be interpreted like so: ""when you have no advantage, play like you have one *and you don't want to lose it*"".

I've noticed a huge improvement in my win rate, KDA, and overall game satisfaction, since I started to take this approach. When I start the game ahead, I almost always win, and when I have a bad game, I NEVER feed as badly as I used to, and make way more comebacks.

To elaborate:

When you're ahead, you want to enjoy being super-fed and deleting people left and right. The tendency will be to start getting sloppy, doing stuff like chasing for kills instead of focusing on objectives and closing the game out quickly. Everyone knows what it feels like to wish you weren't winning quite yet because you're SO close to that last item.

When you're ahead, you want to draw the game out so you can have more fun with your advantage.

Instead, resist this temptation and think, ""win quickly"". Play carefully and focus on not throwing your lead. Enemy got away with 10 health? It's OK, you forced them out of lane and get to take a tower. No need to dive. Just hit the tower and you might get a kill anyway if they decide to stay and defend it.

If you play carefully and methodically while ahead, you won't give your opponents a foothold to make a comeback.

Conversely, when you're behind, you might be seduced by the fatalism of defeat and think, ""It doesn't really matter what I do now, this game is over"". You might not be thinking it consciously, but it affects your play anyway. You give up first blood and think, ""I haven't lost lane yet. I can still outplay them."" Then you give up another kill, and another, and another, and now they're tower-diving you for free. See champ, kill champ.

When you're behind, you want to catch up quickly so you don't have to deal with waiting for a late game that never comes because now they're insanely fed.

Instead, resist this temptation and think, ""lose slowly"". If your lane opponent kills you or burns your flash, you know you're at a disadvantage, so there's NO REASON TO GO ALL-IN unless your jungler is ganking and you know that their jungler isn't hanging around for a counter-gank. So you just farm creep, harass when possible, place wards, and wait for your opponent to make a mistake.

If you play carefully and methodically while behind, you won't give your opponents enough opportunities to snowball in a way that makes the game un-winnable for you.

Hyper-carry - A champion, often an ADC, that does *tons of damage*, more specifically, into late game. These champions are often squishy and weak early, but turn into monsters during late game.

Normal Carry - Doesn't usually scale well into late game. If/when they do, they are not as strong as hyper-carries. Usually strongest early-mid game.

Poke/poking - Safe damage from afar.

Burst - Usually requires abilities, does a lot of damage immediately, but not much after that.

Fed - Being strong or further ahead than you would be normally.
 
CS - Creep score. How many minions/monsters you have killed.
 
Top - Solo top lane.
 
Mid - Solo middle lane.

Scale/Scaling - Renekton's skin. Just kidding. It means to grow/evolve. In this case, it means how you develop or become stronger.
 
**II. Quick Intro from the Author.**
 
Hi guys! Xedeth here. I am a Silver II ADC main. I have been maining ADC since, about, September of 2012, and have loved playing it ever since. This guide will detail everything I know ABOUT everything I know. I listed a nice index, so you can use CTRL+F to search for the section you want to know about specifically, or you can look at the bottom for the summary, also known as the tl;dr! Shall we begin?
 
**III. What are you? Defining the role.**
 
You are an ADC, which means an *Attack Damage Carry*. You use Attack Damage as your main source of damage to kill enemies. The carry part of this title is your role: You scale in a way that allows you to do *tons of damage* to enemies, while your team stands in front and protects you. You farm minions, also known as CS'ing, to gain gold for expensive items you have to buy. You are innately squishy, and in combination with the large amount of damage you do, you will almost always be focused in ganks and teamfights. This segway's into our next section...
 
**IV. What aren't you? Defining what you cannot or are not supposed to do.**
 
You are not the front line. You are not the tank. You are not the initiator. You are not the support, KS'ing (kill securing) is perfectly okay. You are not the leader. (This is subject to changes and exceptions. Some teams do well with the ADC calling the shots, but there are not many, and even fewer that it works for.) You are not the buff control'er. You are not the diver, chef, nurse, nothing.
 
You are not to stop CSing unless you are teamfighting. If you aren't teamfighting, you are CSing.
 
**V. Why are you important?**
 
You provide the core damage of your team in almost every team composition. That's pretty much it. Without you, there is far less damage. This is why CS'ing and getting kills are so important. The more gold you get, the better items you get. The better items you get, the stronger you are, and therefore more useful to your team. An ADC that falls behind or is useless brings the team very far down.
 
***Now let's talk about some champions that can do this role.***
 
**VI. The Meta Champions** 

&gt;[](/ashe) Ashe
 
[Ashe](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ashe) is one of the best champions to learn ADC as. Ashe is a very powerful hyper-carry that provides high utility and damage, while also being able to hold her target(s) down while she kills them. A general end-game build for Ashe is: Zerker's, LW, IE, BotRK, BT, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/caitlyn) Caitlyn
 
[Caitlyn](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Caitlyn) is a long-range ADC that utilizes her sniping abilities to counter champions with small attack ranges such as Quinn/Vayne/Graves. She is not a hyper-carry champion because most of her damage falls off late game while being superb early and the middle of the game. A general end-game build for Caitlyn is: Zerker's, IE, SS, BT, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/corki) Corki
 
[Corki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Corki) is a very old ADC champion that excels in poking team compositions. He has very high burst damage, which is best used against champs that have very little base health such as Ezreal and Twitch. Corki's build path is very haphazard right now, due to his skills + mana costs being very odd, and so he can be built in multiple ways. You can build the same as [Blue Ezreal](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1dvndo/info_blue_ezreal_discussion_and_information/) and have *tons of damage*, or you can build more traditional, such as: Zerker's, Trinity Force, BT, LW, IE/SS, and a situational defensive item, sometimes even a BC. Corki scales best into mid game while falling off very hard, if not drastically fed, into late game.
 
&gt;[](/draven) Draven
 
Welcome to the Leeeeague of [Draaaaaven](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Draven). Draven is a medium-ranged ADC that excels in early game with the use of his Spinning Axe (Q ability.) He is extremely strong between the level 1-2 range, again at level 6, and begins to fall off very hard during late game due to how teamfights are usually fought - that meaning, his strongest damage is from his Q ability and catching his axes again, which is very hard to do when being dove by a team. A usual end-game build for Draven would be: Zerker's, BT, PD, IE, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/ezreal) Ezreal
 
[Ezreal](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ezreal) is an ADC champion that focuses more on casting his abilities than the traditional auto-attacking ADC champion. His strongest ability is his Mystic Shot (Q ability) due to it applying on-hit effects such as SS/Red Buff. Ezreal is best for poking team compositions, and was recently notorious for falling off extremely hard late game. Innovative players have discovered a new building path for him that allows for him to retain his damage into late-game, while also being able to peel off himself. To read more about that, read [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1dvndo/info_blue_ezreal_discussion_and_information/). You can also go the traditional build of: Zerker's/Lucidity/Merc Thread's/Ninja Tabi, IE, SS, BT, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/graves) Graves
 
[Graves](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Graves) is a short-range, bursting champion that also utilizes his passive to become tankier than the common ADC champion. Graves scales best with attack damage items and less with attack speed. What does this mean? It means that Graves should almost always go for a high-damage item before he goes for attack speed. Some champions, such as Vayne/Ashe/Tristana scale very well with attack speed, and because of that can rush items such as Zerker's + BotRK and still do optimal damage. Graves is not one of those champions. He is best mid game and also falls off late game. A usual build for Graves would be: Zerker's, BT, PD, IE, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/jayce) Jayce
 
[Jayce](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Jayce) is a different type of ADC. While primarily, and usually, being an attack damage bruiser used top and mid, Jayce is able to use his higher-than-usual base health and ranged ability to keep pace with other carries. He excels in early to mid game, while, as usual, falling off late game. He is ideal for poking team compositions. A usual build for Jayce is: Merc Thread's/Ninja Tabi, Muramana, BT, BC, LW, and anything from a Sunfire Cape to a GA is perfectly fine for his defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/kogmaw) Kog'Maw
 
[Kog'Maw](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kog'maw) is a hyper-carrying ADC champion that utilizes his ability Bio-Arcane Barrage (W ability) to do *tons of damage* to enemies. Kog'Maw is exceptionally strong late game, while being twice as weak early game. He is one of the squishest ADCs to play, and as such presents a high-risk, high-reward carry. Kog'Maw is best against champions such as Volibear/Nasus who stack health items, since his Bio-Arcane Barrage does percent health damage. A usual build for Kog'Maw is: Zerker's Greaves, BotRK, IE, BT, LW/PD depending on how much armor they have, and generally a Frozen Mallet. Again, Kog'Maw is extremely squishy and needs a good team composition to protect him.
 
&gt;[](/missfortune) Miss Fortune (MF)
 
[Miss Fortune](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Miss_fortune) is a caster ADC champion that scales perfectly into early and mid game, but falls off late game unless the team composition is perfect and you are fed. MF is much, if not exactly the same playstyle, as Graves. She scales with attack damage, not attack speed, and is even better with armor penetration for her ultimate ability (R.) A usual build for MF is: Zerker's, BT, BC, IE, LW, and sometimes a Banshee's Veil as a defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/quinn) Quinn
 
[Quinn](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Quinn) is a short-range, burst ADC champion that focuses on early-game and distance closing to help her scale into any kind of late game. Her passive is insanely strong early game, but should never be used to the extent that it puts you in danger. Quinn is a very hard champion to learn, due to her breaking the ADC-rules of distance closing and being in another player's face, but she also presents high-reward for playing aggressive, but not foolishly. Quinn scales with attack speed extremely well, therefore a usual build for Quinn is: Zerker's, IE, BotRK, LW, BT, situational item.
 
&gt;[](/sivir) Sivir
 
[Sivir](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sivir) is an attack damage caster, much like MF and Graves, but has extremely high mana costs. Sivir is, debatably, extremely underpowered right now due to her not scaling as well as hyper-carries into late game, not having long range, and not scaling into mid game as well as champions such as Caitlyn. That being said, Sivir does very well against players who do not expect her. Using her Boomerang Blade (Q ability) on enemies for *tons of damage* is extremely satisfying. A usual build for her is: Zerker's, IE, PD, LW, BT, situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/tristana) Tristana
 
[Tristana](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Tristana) is a very old (and free!) ADC hyper-carry champion. She scales extremely well with attack speed due to her steroid-like ability (Q ability.) Tristana is strongest mid to late game, and is weak early game due to her passive restricting her range, and thus making it easy to poke her out of lane. A fed Tristana is very, very scary. She can self-peel without items using her Rocket Jump, but that won't matter because the BotRK she uses will delay her needing to use an ability. She is the definition of an auto-attacking ADC champion, and she does it perfectly. A usual build: Zerker's, IE, PD, LW, situational item, BT or another situational item.
 
&gt;[](/twitch) Twitch
 
[Twitch](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Twitch) is a very squishy, high-burst ADC champion that excels in mid game damage. With good positioning, Twitch can even scale and be relevant late game by using his ultimate ability (R) to hit multiple targets at once. Almost never expunge with only one mark on enemies. Just saiyan. A usual build: Zerker's, IE, PD/SS, LW, situational item, BT.
 
&gt;[](/urgot) Urgot
 
[Urgot](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Urgot) is a caster attack damage carry, more like Ezreal than MF or Graves. Urgot is a tanky ranged champion that is well-known for building for anti-ADC champions. His ultimate ability is perfect for picking out the enemy carries while his tankiness allows him to survive in the middle of teamfights, not that that is where you should be anyways! Urgot uses his Acid Hunter ability (Q ability) and his Noxian Corrosive Charge (his E ability) to do damage, thus making him a mana-sucker. Itemization for Urgot is typically high armor and medium damage, such as: Ninja Tabi/Boots of Lucidity, Muramana, Iceborn Gauntlet, BT/LW, and two defensive items if not vastly ahead by mid game.
 
&gt;[](/varus) Varus
 
[Varus](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Varus) is an extremely strong champion. He his high burst, high utility, scales with attack speed well, and does percent health damage. Varus is perfect for a mid-level ADC to learn with because he teaches everything more-advanced such as poking safely, chasing, and more. Varus's usual build is: Zerker's, BT, PD, IE, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/vayne) Vayne
 
[Vayne](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vayne) is, debatably, the strongest champion in the game late game, and my favorite ADC champion. She is also a high-skill cap champion that requires extensive learning, playing, positioning, knowing all of the fundamental's of ADC'ing, and a little bit of luck and prayers to be perfect with her. I have never seen a perfect Vayne, though DoubleLift might be the closest I've ever seen. Do not forget that your Tumble (Q ability) is an auto-attack reset, meaning, you can attack, immediately Tumble, and get another auto-attack off faster than you usually would. Build: Zerker's, BT, PD, IE, LW, situational item. OR Zerker's, BotRK, IE, LW, situational item, BT.
 
**VII. Itemization**
 
***Quick, helpful comment from /u/HotSake***

""*Also, when discussing items, you might mention why ADCs are late-game monsters - stat synergy. Crit chance, attack speed, and attack damage combine multiplicatively to improve your auto-attacks. Getting +5 AD is better if you have 2.0 AS than if you have 1.0, adding 10 DPS instead of 5. Increasing your AS will pump your DPS more if you have more AD, and crit, as a damage multiplier to your AD, gets better the more AD you have and the more times you're attacking. ADCs scale off of AD * AS * Crit. Early on, you're buying these stats in dribs and drabs, but they each get better the more of the others you have. That last 10% AS when you finish your build adds more DPS than even doubling your AD would have at level 1. This is why your job is to farm; your base stats suck, but your power curve gets steeper and steeper the farther you get by adding these particular stats. Contrast this with an AP caster, whose damage increase from adding AP is linear. If they have a 0.6 AP ratio on a spell, then going from 0 to 100 AP will add 60 damage, but so will going from 300 to 400. AP is cheap, but it doesn't scale the same way.*""

*But Xedeth! Most of those builds look exactly the same! Why is that??*
 
The paths you take to each item aren't illustrated above because I wanted to explain how each path is different, when to pick certain things over others, and such.
 
[](/infinityedge) vs. [](/thebloodthirster)
 
*IE vs. BT When should you get which first?*
 
BT is almost always a first major item pickup for champions that scale best with attack damage, such as MF/Graves. This item is also good when you are ahead with champions such as Varus/Quinn.
 
IE is mostly when you begin to fall-behind in damage, such as when you are behind in CS or are dying a lot, or for when you are playing a hyper-carry champion that isn't going to be best for early game regardless.

Also, [here is an article for helpful reading!](http://www.reignofgaming.net/blogs/a-different-view/gentleman-gustaf/22787-bloodthirster-vs-ie)

/u/phroxzon made a really good point, where Graves/MF are nearly exempt from this rule, where BT is almost mandatory first on them.

[](/statikkshiv) vs. [](/phantomdancer)
 
*SS vs. PD When to use which?*
 
You'll notice that I didn't list SS in very many builds, and the reason for that is utility. SS is best for champions that need help wave-clearing (clearing waves of minions) quickly for split-pushing compositions (team compositions where the team is almost never grouped and one-two people are going for different lanes alone.) PD is best for amplifying damage to single-targets, especially for hyper carry champions. PD is able to 'melt' enemies faster than SS, where as SS is able to clear waves for safety, split-pushing, or farming.
 
[](/bladeoftheruinedking)
 
*BotRK When is it okay to build this first?*
 
Generally, it's really, really important that you have a lot of damage first. Focusing on this core point, if you are playing a champion with innate damage such as Quinn or Tristana, then it is okay to go BotRK first, especially when ahead on these champions. One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is rushing BotRK on champions such as MF or Graves. At that point, you have lost lane, and will lose mid game unless your team feeds you like crazy.
 
*Situational Defensive Items. Want to be more specific?*
 
A situational defensive item can be many things. This includes GA, FM, Mercurial Scimitar, Sunfire Cape, Warmog's, and even Randuin's Omen. Items, such as GA, Mercurial Scimitar, and Warmog's, are best against teams that have high ability power damage, and thus need a cleanse (de-buff) or magic resist. Other items, such as Sunfire Cape, Randuin's Omen, and FM, are best against teams that are mainly melee champions and/or attack damage teams where high armor wins.
 
[](/berserkersgreaves)[](/berserkersgreaves)[](/berserkersgreaves)
 
*Zerker's Zerker's Zerker's*
 
I don't really have a comment on that except I have never seen a Berserker's Greaves Ezreal ever consistently win games. (I am okay with being proven wrong here, lol.)
 
**IIX. Orb Walking/Kiting and CSing - Your bread and butter.**
 
*What is Orb Walking/Kiting?* [Orb Walking/Kiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvMc3EZ2xk) is the use of moving while attacking to maintain positioning and continuing max damage per second. This is NEEDED at higher skill levels of play, and OPTIMAL at any level of play. It is does far more than you think.
 
*CS'ing, why is it important?* A broke ADC is a useless one. It is truly as simple as that. Now, *what is a good benchmark to judge my CS by?* Professional players can typically maintain a 100 CS every 10 minute threshold. You can almost always get away with 70-80 CS per 10 minutes. Anything less means you're falling behind. Refer to the first sentence of this paragraph to understand why falling behind is bad. *How do I CS?* CS'ing, or farming, is the act of last hitting minions and monsters so that the lane does not push, keeping you in a safe portion of the lane to continue CS'ing. Something that happens to me is that I'll miss the first minion into lane, and after that I am on tilt because I will either over-compensate, or under-compensate. Don't do that. Just relax and fit it into a rhythm. Attacked too early? That's okay, worry about the one minion later. Just relax and focus.
 
**IX. Support and You.**
 
Support. Your best friend. Your second-brain, actually, no, forget that, you guys/gals are one brain. What you think, he/she thinks, and vice versa. You have to understand one another completely. When you mess up, the support better have your back, and, again, vice versa. There is no *bot lane* without the *support*. To quote /u/gregidot, [""Here's the problem, we've given them this name ADC, attack damage carry. In lane, you ain't carryin' shit. Without my wards, without my pings, without my slows, without my exhaust, without my stun, you ain't shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8N5yTdGhIU) (Mild racial humor.) You better love that support, because a good support is hard to come by, and one that understands you is even harder.
 
*Now, more so, what is their job?*
 
This isn't a support guide.
 
*What kind of support synergizes with the champion I am playing?*
 
An easy rule of thumb is this:
 
Hyper carries do best with supports that can sustain them through the roughest part of the game for them, laning phase. Supports such as Taric, Soraka, and Janna can do this. Also supports that boost your stats, such as Nunu, Lulu, or, again, Janna.
 
Burst champions do best with supports that amplify damage or lock down a target, such as Leona, Taric, and Fiddlesticks.
 
Caster champions fit best with the same supports for burst champions, but are also great with sustain.
 
Poking champions are great with supports that can disengage, because the best thing to beat poke is all-in teams. This description matches Janna, Fiddlesticks, Taric, and Sona. Sona is ideal for poking champions due to her poking abilities and disengage abilities.

**X. Summoner Spell Discussion - What to use and when?**
 
[](/flash) &amp; [](/ghost)

It is almost always needed to take Flash, and if you are unable to or think something else would be better, Ghost is the other option as your escape/distance closing summoner spell. All in all, flash is the best summoner spell in the game due to its different functions and playstyles that it presents that Ghost can't.
 
As for secondary summoner spells, what are the options? Cleanse, Barrier, and Ignite are the other three options to use for secondary summoner spells. Each has pros and cons, and I shall list both.
 
[](/cleanse)

***[Cleanse](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cleanse)***
 
Pros:
 
Gets rid of ignite.
 
Gets rid of exhaust.
 
Gets rid of some crowd control abilities.
 
Cons:
 
Not an aggressive summoner spell.
 
Certain crowd control won't be affected (Malzahar's ultimate?)

""'Certain crowd control won't be affected by cleanse (Malzahar's ultimate?)' Just wanted to point out that cleanse doesn't affect supression (malz ulti, urgot ulti etc) but a quicksilversash does."" - /u/Ivermk
 
Doesn't help win trades unless the enemy is using ignite.
 
*Best used* on hyper carries to ensure that they can live through a team fight or laning phase.
 
[](/barrier)

***[Barrier](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Barrier)***
 
Pros:
 
Counters ignite.
 
Scales into mid game well.
 
Great for baiting the enemy into attacking you.
 
Cons:
 
Falls off late game.
 
Still leaves you open to crowd control abilities.
 
*Best used* on champions that are great early to mid game champions to help them live while also being aggressive.
 
[](/ignite)

***Ignite***
 
Pros:
 
Highly aggressive ability.
 
Great for finishing off an enemy.
 
Don't forget that it lowers healing.
 
Cons:
 
Easily countered by Protect or Cleanse.
 
Doesn't do as much late game.
 
*Best used* on very few, honestly. More than likely on distance closing champions like Jayce or Quinn.
 
**XI. Team fighting - What's your job?**

Your job, as the majority of the damage, is to *safely* put in as much damage as you can into a team fight while maintaining a position that allows you freedom to stay away from the enemy team's front line divers. While it is always good to focus damage on the enemies' carries, it is better for you to do as much damage as possible. Meaning, it is perfectly okay to target the Shen if he is in your face, killing you, or is separating you from their carries.

**XII.Trading - Why does that guy have a shinier Charizard than you?**

Trading is the act of doing small, safe damage to your opponent's health in an attempt to make them stand further back, pop a health potion, or even send them back to base.

*Why is this important?*

Successful trading with an opponent will deny him farm and cause him to fall behind in gold, items. Although it is just a minion or two here or there, it all begins to add up eventually, and this will push you ahead.

**XIII. Lane Control - One simple video.**

[This is the act of using lane control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kxGQ3gWdrM) You can do this as an ADC by 'freezing' the lane, which means, to stop where the minions are attacking each other to deny farm from the enemy. They are forced to either go into a dangerous position, sometimes costing a kill, or are forced to play it safe and lose gold.

**XIV. What to do after laning phase and that sexy tower goes down?**

As /u/FozzieBearWasTheMan points out, a ton of ADCs make the mistake of staying bot lane and farming, often dangerously, instead of progressing the game.

Your job as an ADC, after that tower goes down, is to push bot lane as hard as you can. I'm talking [push it, push it. To the limit, limit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3-JA49q-0o). After you have done that, go mid lane and push down that tower. Take dragon when it is up. Help top lane when you can. Do everything you can to help your team while also maintaining your role on the team.

**XV. Strategies**

[](/golem) &amp; [](/wolf)
 
*Double Golems/Wolves. When is this good?*
 
***This is not going to be relevant for very long. This will be changed so that it will no longer be worth doing in the upcoming patch.***
 
Doing this makes it so that you and your support can hit level two faster. This is best with champions who gain a stun, distance closer, or anything that can assist you in getting an early kill, such as Leona, Taric, Fiddlesticks, etc.
 
*Lane Swapping. When is this good and what is this?*
 
Okay, first off, almost never in ranked.
 
Moving on from that, lane swapping is extremely advanced, and frankly, I can only tell you the basics because I have never had it work for me perfectly.
 
Lane swapping is best for when you are on purple side, so you can use double golems to gain a level advantage, and then use that advantage to beat the enemies' solo top laner. Doing this by shoving the wave to turret, taking an early turret, and re-swapping back to bot lane. This provides you with extra gold and more map presence, allowing for follow-up dragons to be easier, and for laning phase to be easier for you and your support. This is extremely difficult for YOUR solo top laner to do. They are forced into a 1v2 situation, and can have the same thing happen to them. Advanced strategy.
 
Can't tell you anything helpful about going mid. I think it provides more pressure against the enemy jungler and their buffs.
 
[](/dragon)*Dragon*
 
Completely forget a key part of this that /u/HotSake reminded me of. Dragon gives you an attack speed debuff, so do not tank it unless 100% unavoidable.
 
[](/baron)*Baron*
 
See above.
 
*(I'd love for more tips here. I feel it is lacking, but I can't think of more.)*
 
**XVI. How other roles/teammates affect you.**
 
*How does top lane affect you?*
 
Assuming your solo top laner is a tank or initiator, they are your front line and protection in a team fight. It's generally a good idea for them to peel for you.
 
*How does mid lane affect you?*
 
A good mid laner will often roam to bot, or even top, lane to make a kill happen. This is extremely helpful. You should thank him some time. But not right now, you better hit that CS slave.
 
*How does jungle affect you?*
 
Jungle is that awkward friend you have that helps you out from time to time, but you don't see him often because there are prettier people who reward him better. Jungler's a strong for an ADC, but with how much supports ward (or should be warding,) it is extremely hard for them to gank. A successful gank from a jungler should usually be followed up by doing dragon/baron.
 
**XVII. Summary and Credits.**
 
tl;dr ADC is a role that does the most consistent damage, but is also usually squishy. Many champions can do this job, and some better than others. There are different play styles, different builds, and different roles that some ADCs fill, but generally the first sentence describes them. Your support is your wife. That part is important too.

For all I know you're an LCS level player who just wound up on /r/SummonerSchool for shits and giggles. I can, however, tell you this: that until a surprisingly high level of play, and even in diamond level games, *a lot* of games are lost in strategy. Some people believe that you can get to gold by farming well alone. This is balderdash. There are a lot of things you simply must do in order to win a game, and many of these things have nothing to do with your ability to lasthit. 

**Strategy Number One: Decide on Your Strategy in the Loading Screen**

When you start a game, you can tell a lot by just what the team and lane compositions are. Do you have a LeBlanc on your team against a Mordekaiser on the enemy team? You and I both know who's going to push.

A lot of people go AFK during the loading screen. A lot of people just zone out and browse the net. This isn't a huge problem, but if you want to increase your team's chances of winning, you should decide on an early gameplay *during the loading screen.* This is especially important for junglers. What are you going to do? Are you going to make a full jungle route? Who is their jungler, and what is he likely to do? Is your jungler an early ganker or a later ganker? Who is likely to have an easy or hard time in lane? Who's up against a difficult lane? This will all drastically affect the strategy your team should take. On that note...

**Strategy Number Two: Lane Switch**

It's seen so often in professional games that games where people *don't* lane switch seem to have become the minority. Why aren't people doing the same in solo queue? There is absolutely no reason not to. If you are playing Brand against a Kassadin, you know that you can't lane against him. He's going to beat you unless he's mentally handicapped. That's what he's designed to do. However, if you're going 1v2 against a Graves/Taric, and he's going 1v2 against an Ezreal/Sona, you will come out ahead in farm and be able to hold your tower for far longer than he can. 

A lot of very annoying solo queue stompers fall flat in 1v2. They can easily be countered by switching lanes and aiming to take a very early tower. Disrupt their gameplan with a smart switch. It works.

**Strategy Number Three: Objectives on Kills**

League of Legends is a game that revolves around killing the Nexus. That's all that matters. If you can kill the enemy Nexus, it doesn't matter if you're down 2-31. Wins don't give less LP for being sloppy.

When you get a kill, you open up an opportunity for an objective. Think about it this way: it's 6 minutes in. Your jungler comes to gank your lane, and you two successfully get a kill. 95% of solo queue players will just go B to buy an item for that sick DPS, but 5% will see this for what it is: an enormous opportunity to further push your team towards killing that Nexus, which is a turret. Or 50% of HP off the turret. Or a dragon. Or an invade. Every time an enemy dies, you should immediately think to yourself: what can my team do with this opportunity? Objectives steamroll other objectives as well. When you take a mid tower, that allows you to coordinate for a four man gank at bottom lane, which might have been a losing lane up until that point, but now you have two enemy towers down and a tremendous amount of map control. All of this started because you just made the most of an opportunity.

**Strategy Number Four: Ward and Invade**

This strategy is especially useful when the game is very close or your team is slightly ahead. It's rather self-explanatory but very simple. If you ward key choke points in the enemy jungle and neutral enemy buffs, you have opened up an opportunity to catch somebody out. Games are won or lost on people getting caught out. Everybody knows how it works: your Lux goes into the enemy jungle alone to check if their blue is up, and instead of finding a blue finds 5 Garens standing in a bush who all gangbang her and then take Baron. Instead, pushing your lanes in, warding up the enemy jungle as a team of five, and going in together to catch somebody out seems like a much better way to go about things.

Most people who are high ELO have good mechanical skills, but a lot of them just know the game really well. You don't find many high ELO players who have no game sense and don't know what to do. People who play the game well do so with well thought out decisions. It's an aspect of the game that can't be ignored, and maybe this opening post can serve as a small introduction of things you can do to increase your chances of winning in solo queue.

1376348189.0,147,self.summonerschool,1k8mnc,Diamond 1 rambling about supporting out of lane (for players &gt;=gold),JoncIaude,172,25,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1k8mnc/diamond_1_rambling_about_supporting_out_of_lane/,"Hi I'm Jonclaude, a diamond 1 AD/support player. So I was responding to an earlier reddit post about what supports should be doing outside the lane phase and ended up writing much more than I originally intended. I think my rambling might prove to be useful to any aspiring support players though, so here are a few things to keep in mind.

The biggest problem I've seen lower level supports have is getting caught. When your team is screaming at you to ward, most people try to rush too much and end up getting caught. Since you receive the least gold, but are still worth the same amount as any other champion, getting caught is THE WORST thing you can do as a support. So like sprd said, ask your team to accompany you when you go to ward crucial areas (baron, dragon, etc) if you don't already have vision of the enemy team. If you don't have your team with you, and the enemy team is MIA, but you NEED to ward a certain location: ward EVERY bush you have to face check to get there. You have 5 stacks on your sight stone and only 3 wards can be out at a time, meaning 2 of the 5 could be used to ward a bush you need to pass through.

I'm sure there is much more detailed information on warding out there, but there is one key ward that for some reason, only advanced players do: the mid lane ward. You may hear casters talk about the importance of the mid tower, this is because the vision provided by it gives SO much control. The middle of the map has the most movement, because you must pass through it to get bot or top (I know, sounds obvious) so having vision mid is vital to see where the enemy is posturing for a play. This means that, if your mid turret is down, you should ward mid lane, just out of the enemy turret’s vision range. In addition, any objective that is taken for YOUR team, should also be warded to further your lead. If you down their mid outer, ward mid lane just out of range of the mid inner. If you down mid inner, ward about where the mid inner was (not too close to the inhib turret because you'd like to see movement in/out of the jungle into mid). If you just downed mid inhib, ward the inhib. The reason for this is that often times, when you down an inhib, you are winning the game and are probably looking to baron with the fallen inhib pressure, this allows you to see when enemies are still in base and thus gives you an easy decision to safely baron. The inhib ward also lets you see how the enemy is positioning to farm the onslaught of minions coming their way and if they make a misstep and extend, even just a little out of their base, you will know and possibly be able to catch them. Seriously though, LANE wards are possibly even MORE valuable than jungle exit/entrance or brush wards.

Getting used to that ward might bump you up a rank or two honestly, but that's enough about mid lane wards. As for team fighting, most supports are lost in this phase at lower levels it seems. They are either lost or are way too concerned with landing the ""perfect"" crescendo or solar flare. When I smurf with my friends I realized that supports forget to SUPPORT at this level. By this, I mean support their priority carry(The carry on your team that the other team is lusting to kill, it’s usually obvious). Now, there are some situations when the most fed person on your team is going to dive into everyone anyways (like Diana or Liss or something) which leaves you with your mediocre ADC to defend. Now you have a choice, you might want to just say fuck myADC and dive the other team's priority target (if your AD is significantly weaker than theirs and you're playing a support like leona). But if you played your support well in lane 6/10 your support will be ahead of theirs (I say 6/10 because at this level of play its very possible to just get shit ADCs). If your ADC is the enemy team's priority target, use ALL your shit defending him. Since you stated you play leona and zyra, this means you should blow ALL your shit on whoever is diving your ADC. Instinctively, all Leonas want to dive the other ADC, but if you can CC the divers so much that your own ADC is AAing the whole time, their tanks will fall first and you will win the fight. It's a misconception that ADCs should target the other carries. If an ADC is playing correctly, he should be kiting and killing the tanks and the team fight is won by whoever positioned correctly to AA more and kill the other team's tanks faster. This means, that yes, it is 100% ok to use solar flare EXCLUSIVELY on J4. And yes, using crescendo on 1 or 2 targets that are diving the most fed player on your team is A-Okay (obviously you should try to get someone else in there with the tip of the cone if you can). If you are running exhaust, don’t think you have to run through the whole fucking team fight to lane your exhaust on the enemy ADC, it’s ok to use it on J4 too (I’m using J4 in this example because he can ALWAYS close the gap with flag/drag/ult and is a common pick at this time).

A word about exhaust though. It is a huge misconception that supports are required to run exhaust (I’d still run flash 100% time though). In arranged/competitive it’s ALMOST a requirement because you have to go into the game assuming the opponent is as good as you and assume that the game will play out as it should (with your ADC having the most gold at the end- this is empirically true in every competitive league. ADCs get the most gold when the game is played correctly). With these assumptions made, it makes exhaust a requirement because it gives another ability for you to use to peel for your ADC. That said, we do still see supports opting for ignite in some games. This is rare and why/when pros use ignite in competitive games is completely situational and much beyond the scope of this response. But then there’s good ol’ solo q. While exhaust is needed in 95% of competitive games, I’d say it’s needed in about half the games in solo q. This is because it is very possible to crush a lane in solo q and ignite allows you to do this better. If you get into a game while running ignite and don’t end up crushing your lane, then it’s not a huge deal and solo q isn’t about winning every game, its about taking calculated risks and winning 60% of games.(its ok to get shit on in 4/10 games if you can shit on the other lane in 6/10 games). So, when to take ignite over exhaust? When the enemy team has no high-burst diving champion and (Zed, Talon, Akali, etc) and your ADC didn’t pick either Vayne nor Kog’Maw. With any other set up, you should be looking to win lane with ignite, not just farm. So that was a ton more than I originally intended to write, but I hope it helps.

P.S. This is by no means a complete guide to supporting, just a few things to think about. In fact, if you are a less experienced player, this information is much less relevant to you, because you should be focused on the basics which I'm sure are outlined in a multitude of other threads/guides.

1367947973.0,145,self.summonerschool,1dvget,On the problem of adopting high elo moves without understanding them.,Vaethin,165,20,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1dvget/on_the_problem_of_adopting_high_elo_moves_without/,"*This is largely based on what I see in Solo Queue.*

Back when I used to play Starcraft II I often times watched Day9. For those who don't know him : He has a daily Starcraft II show in which he  analyzes certain topics and games and explains to your average viewer why and what a the pro player is doing.

One of the things that really stuck with me and that I carried over to LoL is his advice on adopting certain tricks/gimmicks that pro players do, without understanding what exactly they're doing or what they achieve by doing it. 

That is a behaviour that's rampant even in Gold and low Platinum so I wanted to adress a few of those behaviours:

**Smiteless blue buff:** While I appreciate that people have started taking their junglers seriously and giving them a lot of help at the beginning, I think many people have taken it too far. 

Smiteless blue allows you to do your red buff more quickly and do early level 3 ganks (and a lot of them as well). If you are planning on doing early level 3 ganks then a smiteless blue buff is the way to go. If you don't - then it's not.

 Not smiting actually makes you lose more HP  than if you had smited it (unless your laners have high DPS at lvl 1, like Karthus/Olaf). On junglers who want to get to 6 asap (Skarner, Amumu, etc) this this actually makes your jungle slower because you are ""forced"" to do redbuff right after blue (or else you are wasting time in which you dont have your smite on CD). 

The better alternative would be the Wolves -&gt; Blue -&gt; Wraiths -&gt; Wolves or Twins -&gt; Redbuff -&gt; Wraiths route. No waiting, hardly any CD on the smite, the perfect route for power-leveling.

**Starting redbuff on manaless junglers**: ""LOL Shyvana, why do you start blue, you don't have mana"".

 Again this is a question of ""what do you want to do?"" Starting redbuff means that you can start ganking right after red-buff, at level 2. This can be very efficient on champions like Shaco or Lee-Sin, BUT what does this do if you do not actually want to gank at lvl 2? Lets say your enemy has fairly safe lanes and you want to wait until level 3 with ganking, so you can use your safeguard on a minion or a similar skill combination.

 If you start red and then don't immediately start ganking you are effectively wasting time on that red-buff . By starting blue your first gank will be a little bit later but it will be stronger and you will be able to gank more often.

**Warding one side of your lane as mid laner**: Now, don't get me wrong - wards are good and I'm not gonna tell you to place a ward on both sides of the lane, but something people seem to ignore is, that warding the wraith jungle entrance is a job half done.

 When you only ward one side of your lane you have to watch your other lanes to see if their jungle might be moving through the river. Also if you ward to your left and then stay on the right side of the lane then your ward is mostly useless - Ward one side and then stay on that side to be as far away as possible from the side that the enemy jungler can come from without you seeing. Seems obvious but apparently to some people it isn't.

**Lane-Ganks**: Before you do a lane gank (a gank in which you dont enter through the river but through the lane) you should check two things: 1) Can I enter the bush without being seen / can I close the gap faster than he can run away AND ""Would it be easier to just go through the river/the enemy jungle. Unless the enemy laner is auto-attacking the tower the distance you'll need to close for an enemy who is pushing your laner to the tower is pretty damn big. Lee Sin can often times do it, Shaco with boots of mobility can do it ... Nautilus and Nasus can't.

 Again, something that is apparently obvious and yet I see so many people doing it wrong. Lane ganks are for special occasions, either when you have a specialised character, if your enemy is warding and overextending or if your laner is pushing and thus allowing you to get into the bushes. If neither of those are the case then you are wasting your time and you would be better off just going through the river or possibly through the enemy jungle. Remember: You can always ask if/where the enemy has warded, most people in low/mid elo aren't very secretive about their wards so walking around them is not a very big problem.

Well anyways, I hope you learned something and will use your brain before adopting tricks you learned in a stream.

Have fun and good luck, summoners ;-)

1360681029.0,146,self.summonerschool,18dnpt,Countering the 4 man gank,xSaviorself,161,15,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18dnpt/countering_the_4_man_gank/,"We've all been in this position before:

You are either the ADC or support. The enemy ADC is ahead in CS, your tower is half health, none of your lanes are really winning and the enemy team has a slight advantage. Suddenly the mid laner disappears and pings start to come down your way. Out of the corner of your eye you see the enemy jungler crossing just around the edge of your ward. You know what is about to happen, but all you can do is watch.

The 4 man gank is incoming. Your mid laner is following down towards bottom, the jungler is likely on his way as well. They won't make it. You get to the turret and prepare to make a stand. But wait, there is your first mistake.

The 4 man gank is a huge commitment to snowballing a lane and gaining a huge advantage. It seems like such a solid play, however there are a few ways to negate or even take advantage of the situation.

As the ADC and support you get dove under the tower once the minion wave reaches the tower. You need to not be there. Losing a tower alone is much better than giving a double kill to the opposing ADC or mid laner and a tower. Run away.

As a jungler and mid responding to this, there are 3 options. Follow down lane, risk getting caught out of position or arriving late to the party and further contributing to the enemies lead. Or you could take mid tower. You are completely safe from gank if the two top champions are still duking it out. Go for the tower and tell your teammates to let theirs die. Have mid or jungle gank top, take the top turret and roam down to mid lane to go for that turret.

If the pressure the opposing team is applying on your bot lane is simply too much to handle, force them to leave and return to lane in order to keep that advantage. In the time it takes for the 4 man gank to reset in lanes you will likely be able to take both mid and top turret and even get a kill off of top. If the enemy takes the turret and immediately turns to dragon, have your mid and jungle get the mid turret and prepare to engage the enemy at dragon.

The enemy likely thinks they have a free dragon. They are wrong. Chances are they are all weak or at least missing some health. Wait for the dragon to get low and force them to disengage. Follow up and steal the dragon or get a free quadra, maybe even both. Take your pick.

The 4 man gank relies on the element of surprise and panic. Stay calm and cut your loses. Sometimes dropping a turret is advantageous to a lane so that they can farm safely and catch back up while the rest of your team defends and distracts. Remember that you need to make the plays if you want to win the game, but you cannot make the mistakes. Let them make the error of thinking they have an advantage and turn the game right on it's head. Make the play on dragon or counter jungle the enemy, take any buffs they may have sacrificed for this tower, take mid and top from the enemy. Punish them for being greedy.

TL;DR don't risk dying bot lane to the 4 man gank, give up the tower for two of theirs, counter jungle the enemy and gank top. Bait the dragon attempt and pick up a free quadra and a dragon. Make some plays worthy of youtube and punish the enemy for being greedy!

For Example: Enemy mid laner roams bot, ends up picking up a kill on your ADC.

""WTF NICE MIA MID LANE GG.""

My answer most of the time to anyone complaining to any teammate about MIA's is simply ""Look at your minimap."" I feel like that isn't really accurate and condescending at this point to say.

So, here are a few things to keep in mind for you to personally play better without relying on someone else calling MIA.

. Have a mental image of what you expect to see when you look at the minimap. This is huge imo. If you look without preparing yourself, it's like reading a page from a book and then realizing you didn't retain any information.

. Make a count of enemy champs, ally champs, and their positions.

. Use any information you have to effect your decisions. Ex, do you know enemy TF has his ult?

. How vulnerable are you? How vulnerable are other ally lanes to ganks?


These are just a few things that have helped me. These kind of actions allow you to react in lane. The title is a little off because it's not all about ""not dieing to ganks."" For example, knowing their jungler is currently ganking somewhere away from you let's you play aggressive / steal their jungle without too much risk.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_15kdyj,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/15kdyj/stop_relying_on_mias_start_dying_less/,

I think only with an accumulation of various inputs can we grow as people in any aspect we wish to succeed in.

I started off in Silver III and have now worked may way up to Platinum III and still have so much to learn.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

                                                    Bronze I-V/Silver V-III
If you are a Bronze/Silver player chances are you are suffering mechanically more than anything else. Most players of this Elo I have come into contact with have a healthy knowledge of the game. At this Elo you need to know what your champion is capable of but more importantly what the enemy champion and his team are capable of doing to you at any moment in time. You don't need to research cool-downs and mana costs for every champion in the game but it does not hurt to have a rough idea of what they are. Watch what your opponent does and how often to get a better idea.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Farming: 
You need to last hit as many creeps as possible. At this Elo don't think of how many minions you should have at 20 minutes. Think how many minions did I get out of that wave. If you missed 3 or 4 do better the next wave.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Harassing:
This is more advanced but anytime your opponent is trying to last hit and you can hit him without losing a minion yourself you are denying him farm. It takes practice and will not work in every lane match up but it can be extremely effective in securing your lead. He will try and harass you when you are farming as well.

Any time the enemy is harassing you on your side of the minions (for example standing in front of your minion wave) you have the upper hand. Throw out some of your spells or auto attacks and back off before he gets anything on you, the minions will do enough damage to make him back off. Repeat the process several times until he is low enough to go ""all in on"" and kill.


Very few champions have enough early game burst potential to take an enemy from 100% HP to 0% HP. A mindset I see a lot of at Bronze is, ""I am going to try and kill him"" without taking into account how much HP he has and how much damage you can REALLY do. Part of this is a lack of knowledge but to be on the safe side try and slowly damage your opponent over the course of a couple minutes. Make him use all his pots before you even have to use one. If he doesn't have any pots even better, few champions have enough sustain to stay in lane through continuous poke. Keep throwing auto attacks at them or shooting off ranged spells. When the enemy is low enough go for the kill, throw everything you have at him and by this time you should have it. Don't be discouraged when your opponent gets away without a kill. Your goal is to do as much damage to your enemy all the while taking as little damage to yourself. It may sound simple but it is not practiced strictly enough. If your opponent has to back and you have full health you can continue to farm the lane and snowball even farther ahead of him so next time he comes back you will get the kill for sure. If you take too much damage you will be forced to back as well and your lead will be minimal. You don't always know for a fact you will get the kill so play like you won't. Play like you need to stay in lane as long as you can. The better your items the better chance you have of winning your lane and then the game.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Trading:
Trading was touched on a little above so I won't go into tremendous detail over it. Essentially you want to deal as much damage to your opponent while taking as little damage to your own character as you can. Repeating this act will in most cases result in killing your opponent or bullying him out of lane.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Proactive VS. Reactive:
A major problem with this Elo range is what I like to call proactive or reactive. Most of the time I see players ""reacting"" to situations. For example you go to farm a minion and the enemy harasses you and you ""react"" by backing away or throwing a spell at the enemy. You need to be thinking ""Ok I want that minion that's getting low there, but I know he will try and attack me if I go for it."" So you throw out a spell to push him back then go in for the farm. I am not using this example as a ""how to farm guide"" it's just a mindset. You need to have clear goals in mind and ideas on how to accomplish them. In lane one of your goals should be to get every minion in each wave and get your opponent low enough to kill. Expect obstacles and overcome them. Be proactive NOT reactive.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
                                                       Any Elo
Attitude:
This is a subject I understand all too well. My attitude was TERRIBLE I would say the worst in the game. I was in the top 1% of League of Legends most toxic players. The problem is at the end of the day I knew I was a shit person for saying those terrible things, I knew I was a bad teammate, I knew I was playing poorly, I knew all of these things that people told me ""not to do"" or to ""improve on."" The problem was I would agree with them and then I would repeat the process. So how do you take what is seemingly common sense and instill it into someone else? How do you take someone with a bad attitude and give them a new outlook on the game?

YOU DON'T. There is no assemblage of words that is going to magically change your attitude. You can watch inspirational and uplifting YouTube videos and sure it'll help but for how long? You are not going to be as calm as some of those Pro players in LCS overnight. We live in a world of instant gratification and in many ways it's simply amazing for example having almost limitless amounts of knowledge available to us through our cell phones or computers. 

The downside is that we get accustomed to all things in life being this way. It's not because you're a bad person or less of a person, it's simply habitualization. We get accustomed to the way things work in our day to day lives. Life is so easy sometimes we feel like were on auto pilot, we don't have to hunt for our food, it isn't survival of the fittest, and every day we wake up and were still breathing until we're not. Turn off the auto pilot and realize you won't improve at League of Legends automatically. 

Do you wan't to lose a couple pounds and get that six pack? How about learn to play the guitar? Do you want to get out of Elo hell? Well sorry to be the one to tell you but you are not getting it overnight. If you don't give this game the respect you would give an instrument or something that takes dedication, patience, and skill to master you will not progress as quickly as you would like. You will be forever lost in the mindset that you deserve more that you are entitled to a higher Elo that you are better than what you are.

To the guys that continually say ""I was like 19/0/15 but my team fed and lost the game."" CARRY HARDER, make calls, feed kills to other people, do something different because it obviously didn't work. Your team didn't NEED you to be 19/0/15 maybe they needed you to be 25/0/15 or maybe they needed that last Baron you guys lost, maybe they needed someone to ping that bush to say there were enemies, maybe they needed something other than what you did. Now let's say you had a perfect game. You hit LITERALLY every single CS in your lane, you ganked every lane successfully every time you killed your opponent in your lane. You got every Baron, every dragon, landed every skill shot, every buff went to the right person and you still lost. Guess what? It happens. Move on, if you played that well every game you'd be Challenger. It's all about consistency, you can't compare this game to last game or the one before. You do everything you can to benefit your team every game. I play a lot of support and I sometimes miss bubbles that could have changed the game. Actually no I MISS SO MANY game changing bubbles because every ability you have has the chance of changing the game. 

As much you need mechanical consistency you need consistency in your attitude even more.

I know this is a nightmarish long wall of text I just kind of wrote what came to mind in one sitting so if there are any grammatical errors I apologize and hopefully this will help at least one person. I will be on frequently to answer any questions or elaborate on anything. My goal is to do my part and help level out the percentages of players in each Division.

Warm Up:
For those of you that read my previous warm up post I am editing it. It was written on mobile very late last night and quite a few people disagreed so I wanted to touch on a few points.

Warm up games can be any other game mode besides Ranked. The reason they are important is to warm up your hands and your mind. Now every single person is different and everyone's day to day life is different. With this in mind some people may not feel the need to play a warm up. Personally I do not ALWAYS play a warm up game. This is generally only the case if I have performed other tasks that warm up my hands and mind.

Lets put it this way, some people don't have an issue with consistency in mechanics as much as they do knowledge of the game. We all have different things that are holding us back. However I would say for many people in Bronze and Silver it would benefit you to warm up in some way before playing.",Nami,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1375292271.0,nami,,True,t3_1jeob7,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jeob7/my_views_on_how_to_raise_your_elo/,
1374427521.0,133,self.summonerschool,1irbd1,Some Things I've Learned,RoboRevo,153,20,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1irbd1/some_things_ive_learned/,"I've only been playing League of Legends for about a year and I've only been playing ranked for about two months. I'm currently Silver IV and recently ran into a losing streak (lost 4 of 5 games).

I realized I was breaking the rules I'd put in place for myself when it came to other competitive games, like poker, Magic: The Gathering, and Go.

**Rule #1: Don't play on tilt.**

Did you just get trolled? Did the enemy jungler camp your lane while your jungle farmed wraiths for 20 minutes? Did someone on your team call you a newb and get under your skin?

You're on tilt. Walk away (or at least don't play ranked).

This idea comes from poker. If you get wrecked in a hand, your mental focus can be broken. I remember one time at a ring game at Red Rock in Vegas, I got sucked in hard. My top two pair were cleaned out by trip 2's. I stood up, took a twenty minute break, and when I came back, I won it all back and more (including a memorable trip Aces vs. trip Qs against the same guy who'd wiped my two pair).

How do I break this rule when playing League? I had a recent game where my jungle was just not working. I was getting outplayed severely by the enemy jungler, who anticipated my ganks with incredible accuracy and was always there to mess me up. It was incredibly frustrating and I was on tilt. When I loaded up another ranked immediately after, I lost as Yorick to Teemo. To *Teemo*, people. I was not in the right frame of mind. I should have walked away.

**Rule #2: Compromise with Your Opponents**

This rule comes from the game of Go, a classic Chinese board game. It's one of the oldest games in the world and consists of each player placing a single white or black stone on the game board. The objective is to control more territory than your opponent. It's simple to learn, but takes decades to come close to mastering. It's so complex that even the most advanced computers can't beat the best human players (unlike chess).

In Go, you will never have a 100-0 game. Your opponent will always have some territory. If you try to take everything, you're going to lose.

The same applies to League. If you try to defend your bot tower when all five show up, and you're all alone while everyone else is across the map, you're going to get dived. You're going to give up a kill. And you're going to lose that tower anyways.

Don't be afraid to give up that dragon or that tower to your opponent. Just make sure the compromise is fair. While they five-man your bot tower, get your teammates to push top; in the meantime, base and buy. Don't give up free kills defending the impossible.

**Rule #3: Pay Attention to Your Opponents' Behavior**

My former roommate is a big deal in the Magic: The Gathering community. He's an amazing player with a sharp mental game. He can often tell what his opponent is holding a turn before they play it. It's pretty incredible to watch.

How does he do it? He watches his opponent. Just like in poker, there are tells in Magic. Believe it or not, there are tells in League, too, and you probably recognize many of them already.

Has your top lane opponent suddenly left while the lane is semi-pushed? Check if the mid is gone. If so, your bot lane is in trouble - those are signs of a four-man gank on bot while top covers mid.

Is your lane opponent normally careful and reserved, but suddenly rushes forward and starts killing the minions as quick as they can instead of last-hitting? You're about to get ganked.

These are just a couple examples of watching your opponents carefully to predict their behavior. This is much more important for junglers, of course, and it's also something that I'm not very good at - it's probably one of the weakest parts of my game right now. I have a bad habit of focusing on whatever is going on next instead of looking at the big (minimap) picture and deciding, ""Where should I go that the enemy team wouldn't want me to be?"" ""How can I counter what they're trying to do?"" (Going where your opponent wants to be (counterjungling) is also a very good strategy in Go.)

**Rule #4: Learn from Every Game**

You just got beat? Did you call your opponents newbs? Did you complain about your bot lane? Did you whine that your jungler never ganks?

Congratulations. You have learned nothing from playing that game.

When you lose, you lose for a reason. After each game, I try to think about what went right and what went wrong. Was it poor matchups? Was my play sub-par? Should I have been more aggressive at counterjungling? Was my itemization okay? Was I simply outplayed? Outsmarted? How will I stop that from happening next time?

Remember: unless you're a pro in the LCS, you can't claim to be the best. Even Go masters who have dedicated their lives to the game won't claim to fully understand how it works. Resorting to insults and nasty comments about your team or the enemy team when you lose means you aren't studying what actually happened and learning how to avoid it in the future. Not every loss will be your fault, but you can still learn and adapt and grow as a player.

Negativity will not allow you to learn. You can be disappointed with yourself, but don't go toxic. Question the loss. Question the win. Think about what happened and why. Remember sequences of plays - what led to them stealing dragon and getting two kills? Why did the jungler dive the tower - and how'd it work?

1356020163.0,136,self.summonerschool,1567vm,"What Does This Champ Do, Part 1: Ahri - Elise!",Hypercolour,153,17,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1567vm/what_does_this_champ_do_part_1_ahri_elise/,"**Ahri**: Medium-ranged skillshot reliant magic damage assassin. She can put out a high amount of both single target and AoE damage, particularly if she lands her Charm, which forces you to walk towards her. Charm does not go through minions, however. Her ultimate allows her to dash three times whilst also dealing damage to targets around her. Found in mid lane. Fairly high difficulty.

**Akali**: Energy-based melee assassin. She deals primarily magic damage. Beware when you have Mark of the Assassin on you, as she can proc the mark for additional damage with her autoattacks. She can stealth in a ground-targetted AoE. Her ultimate is a long ranged dash that works on an ammo system. She can have up to three charges, and she gains an extra charge on a kill or assist. Found in mid or top lane. Fairly high difficulty.

**Alistar**: A melee support tank focussed on applying CC in teamfights. He has a knockup on his Q and a charge/knockback on his W. He has a small AoE heal, and his ultimate reduces all damage dealt to him, making him incredibly tanky. If played as a support he will tend to play aggressive, so be careful. You can combo W and Q for a medium-ranged dash/knockup. Typically found bot lane, although sometimes jungle. Fairly high difficulty.

**Amumu**: Melee AoE jungler, with incredible teamfight potential. Deals magic damage. He has a long ranged skillshot stun/gapcloser, although it does not go through minions. His W is toggleable, and deals %HP damage on an AoE. His ultimate is a large AoE that deals a decent amount of damage and snares you. He is very prone to being counterjungled early game, and is quite reliant on his first blue buff. Almost always seen jungle. Easy to use.

**Anivia**: Medium-long ranged magic damage caster with high amounts of utility and damage output. Her Q is a very slow skillshot, which stuns if detonated on you. Her W is a solid wall. Her E is a single-target spell that deals double damage if you have been slowed by Anivia recently. Her ultimate a DoT AoE that slows. Beware of her passive, she will be 'egged' and after a brief amount of time, revived after being killed. Susceptible to ganks due to her lack of mobility, also quite blue-reliant. Found in mid lane. High difficulty.

**Annie**: Short ranged magic damage burst mage. Her passive, after four spell casts, grants a stun to her next damaging spell. Her self-targetted shield is a great way to charge this up. Q is single-targetted and refunds mana upon killing a minion with it. Her ultimate summons a giant flaming bear in an AoE, that remains on the field for a short time afterwards. Her burst is *not* to be underestimated. When her stun is ready, you will be able to see a small smoky thing floating around her. Found in mid lane. Easy to use.

**Ashe**: Medium-ranged AD carry with a focus on utility. Can use her Q to gain a slow on her autoattacks. W fires a cone that slows, the cooldown on which gets very low in the late game. Gains a free Clairvoyance from her E, with a shorter range. Her ultimate is a global arrow that stuns on impact based on how far it travelled. Her passive grants her critical strike chance that stacks up whilst not in combat. Her ultimate is very potent for initiating late-game, so be careful not to get caught by it. Standing behind minions in lane can help mitigate her harass with her W. Played in bot lane. Fairly easy to use.

**Blitzcrank**: Melee support with incredible displacement ability and deceptive tankiness. His signature skill is his Q: a long-cooldown skillshot that will grab the first target it hits and drag them to Blitz's location. He can follow this up with E: an autoattack modifier that will knock the target into the air. His passive gives him a shield based on mana, although stacking mana on Blitz is not always the best idea. His ultimate is an AoE damaging silence. Be very careful laning against Blitz as a hook can usually net a kill. Warding side brushes can help with this a lot. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**Brand**: Medium-ranged magic damage burst caster. His passive applies a burn to you, which also grants his abilities extra effects if cast on someone who is burning. His Q, a skillshot, gains a stun. His W, an AoE, gains extra damage. His E, a single-target spell, gains AoE splash. His ultimate, which does high amounts of damage and bounces, will prioritise burning champs. Be careful when laning as he can follow up a stun with huge amounts of damage. Ganking him can be perilous as his ultimate will bounce between you and the jungler. Stand behind minions to block his Q. Found in mid lane. Fairly high difficulty.

**Caitlyn**: High-ranged AD carry. Her Q has a long charge time, but fires a high-damage skillshot that goes through minions. She can place traps which snare when walked over. Her net will knock her backwards and slow anyone it hits, whilst her ultimate fires a single shot at huge range with very high damage, although it can be blocked by other champions. Her passive can be seen and heard as her gun cocks, which means her next shot will deal bonus damage. Has a large amount of poke, so picking a sustain support is a good idea. Quite weak mid game, but strong early and late. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**Cassiopeia**: Medium-ranged magic damage caster with a focus on sustained damage. Her Q and W are ground-targetted poison spells, one being more spammable, whilst the other slowing but having a longer cooldown. Her E is single target and refreshes its cooldown when it hits someone who is poisoned. Her ultimate is a cone that stuns people facing her and slows people facing away. Her damage output is incredibly high, but she does have to get fairly close to deal the optimum amount. Tends to push her lane, making her quite easy to gank. Found in mid lane. Very high difficulty.

**Cho'Gath**: Melee tanky caster with natural tankiness and good utility. Mainly deals magic damage. His Q is a long ranged knockup with a fairly long delay. His W fires a silencing cone, and his E adds magic-damage spikes to his autoattacks. His ultimate is a large true damage nuke that, if it kills a target be they minion or champion, gives him extra HP and increases his model size. Stacks up to six times. His burst damage is quite high, even when he does not build damage. Very versatile in his build options. Found in top lane, mid lane and the jungle. Average difficulty.

**Corki**: Medium-long ranged AD carry with good burst damage and mobility. His Q is a short ranged AoE with high base damage. His W is a dash with a fairly long range. His E shreds the armour of people in front of him, whilst his ult fires long ranged missiles which deal magic damage and stack up via an ammo system. Every fourth bomb deals bonus damage. Huge early game burst damage with his Q and ultimate, although they both do magical damage and as such fall off later on into the game. Very survivable thanks to his dash. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**Darius**: Melee bruiser who deals mixed damage, with an emphasis on physical. His Q is a spin which deals more damage if you are hit by the outer half. His W applies a slow to his next autoattack, and his E hooks people in a cone. His passive applies up to five stacks of magic damage bleed. His ultimate is a short-ranged true damage nuke which deals huge damage, amplified according to how many bleed stacks you have on you. If this kills its target, the cooldown is refreshed. Very hard to trade with due to his huge damage output, although easy to kite, and easy to gank. Mainly found in top lane, although occasionally jungle. Fairly easy to use.

**Diana**: Melee assassin. Deals magic damage. Her Q is a curved skillshot that applies a debuff. W is a sheld that also deals AoE damage. E is an AoE pull. Her ultimate is a medium-ranged dash that deals magic damage, and has its cooldown refreshed if it is used on someone who has been debuffed by her Q. Her passive applies magic damage in an AoE to every third autoattack. Has huge burst damage once she hits level six. Beware of her roaming potential. Found in mid lane primarily, although also seen top and jungle. Fairly high difficulty.

**Dr. Mundo**: Mundo is a melee health-based bruiser/tank that deals mixed damage. His Q is a fairly spammable skillshot that slows and deals magic damage upon hitting. His W deals magic damage in an AoE around him. E is an AD steroid that grants more the lower he is. His ultimate takes a chunk of his health and regens 50% of his max HP over the next few seconds. Also grants MS. Be wary of fighting Mundo 1 on 1 as his damage is very high. All his spells cost health, so bear that in mind when playing him. Mainly found jungle. Easy to use.

**Draven**: Draven is a medium-ranged AD carry with enormous potential damage output. His Q gives him a damage buff for his next autoattack, and sends the axe spinning into the air. If you catch it, the damage buff is granted again. W is an AS and MS steroid that is refreshed upon catching an axe. E knocks people back in a line. His ultimate is a global skillshot that returns upon hitting a champion. His damage output early game is huge, especially with multiple Q's. However, be careful of putting yourself out of position to catch an axe. Found in bottom lane. High difficulty.

**Elise**: Elise is a short-ranged magic-damage caster with the ability to switch into a melee form using her ultimate. In human form she has a single target nuke, an AoE that follows champions, and a skillshot stun. In spider form she has a lunge/nuke/execute, an AS steroid and a leap that makes her untargettable for 2 seconds. When in spider form she will also have several spiderlings following her around. Her burst combo is very potent, particularly given the execute on her spider-form Q. Be careful not to get poked down and jumped on. Found mainly in top or mid lane, although sometimes jungles.

Alot of times when we kill the mid inhibitor of enemy, people stay there for another 2-3 minutes. If you can kill a nexus turret or finish a game, then I understand. But it's just a bit useless to stay there with 30% hp while everyone in enemy team is about to respawn. So just go back if you have nothing else to gain (and prepare for baron).
 
 
After the enemy inhibitor goes down and 2-3 people of us died for nothing because they stayed too long, people say: ""ok lets not throw this and push mid together."" Why would you push mid when superminions are already pushing it. There was a game where we litteraly did nothing for 20 minutes untill mf and me decided to splitpush top and take top inhib (which took us 1 minute, while our other 3 members died again for nothing)

1352041340.0,131,self.summonerschool,12m30s,For all those in ~1200elo Rating - A word from a plat rating jungler,Twibs,152,21,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/12m30s/for_all_those_in_1200elo_rating_a_word_from_a/,"Hey there everyone. I've been playing on my old account which I just got back access to over the weekend there, long story short, it's around 1100 rating. After playing a few games there, I've noticed something.

You guys are actually real good. 

Yes, some of you are and some of you aren't, and there's a little work which could be done with macromanagement, but a lot of you seem to have champion mechanics, last hitting, roaming, etc all at the same standard of a lot of the people I've played against around 1700+ rating. Not to mention the mechanically best damn Jax player I've ever seen or played with, whose name I only wish I could remember.

The problem is, there's a lot of toxic attitude down there - I know y'all have experienced it, I've played maybe 10-15 games and it's been more than obvious. When a lane dies there's very little positive reinforcement, and when they get a kill it's all but ignored in light of negatives. I'd like to think that you guys are above that since you're here, but don't worry, I recon this new honour thing will start to have an influence on that in time. Even if a game isn't snowballing away, it'll sure seem like it.

There are a few little things, though, that i'd like to share with you, just as season 3 starts, that'll hopefully come in useful.

&gt;From the Jax who I mentioned earlier: Don't get disheartened when you're behind.

Early game means literally nothing if you can **maintain** the difference, and I hope that from recent tournaments with CLG.eu's popularity people will realise this. 2k, 5k, even 10k gold means a lot early but as the game gets further on and everyone gets 2 or 3 core items, it comes down to player skill and champion mechanics moreso. This guy went ahead and farmed, got a phage and sheen, and triple killed the enemy by entering the fight after the initiation, putting him back in the game and winning it overall.

&gt;From the Xin who wouldn't shut up: If you need kills to win a lane, don't aim to win the lane.

This guy mained Xin, so picked himslef into what he said was an unfavourable match-up. **That's fine**, a lot of people play 1 champion in ranked, and it's something I recommend - **familiarity is much stronger at this level than actual picks-counterpicks**. However he was quite obnoxious to our jungler, who was doing grand, because he only got him 1 of the 2 kills he asked for - literally said ""I need 2 kills to win lane, camp top please"". Farming is a legitimate way to reach late game - even hardpushing and roaming when they b. Also if you can *only* lane against champion x with kills, either don't pick yourself into the matchup, or play defensively and wait for the jungler to reach your lane - even if that puts you behind, are you behind as much as you would be dead? You may even get a kill if they get cocky and missplay. If you can play your champ in teamfights with slightly less items, you're well on your way up.

&gt;From the Evelynn: Listening is half the battle

This was just after froggen's lee mid thing in MLG, and we had a lee mid on the enemy team. I told her to run an armour page just in case - pulled out a 25 armour + mpen malphite page and rolled the lane as a result; **If someone gives you advice in champ select or in game, chances are it's good.** They want to win the game as much as you do, 98% of the time.


&gt;Supports; Don't underestimate and don't get complacent.

This is in there for obvious reasons - supports are such because they **provide essentially the same function with or without items**. But don't underestimate a support, even at my rating I've [carried on a support.](http://i.imgur.com/TVEH1.jpg) I get that y'all think support is boring, but if you can play it even reasonably, catch the enemy off guard, you can potentially win a game. It's by no means my favourite roll (that's jungle, no question), but I find it a lot more enjoyable than top lane. Oh and speaking of that...


&gt;Picking Lane X because ""Getting out of Elo Hell"" guides say to

This is retarded unless you main a champion in that roll. As I said before, **familiarity is much stronger than counterpicking**. If you know you can't win a trade you won't engage, if you know you can you will. But this is most galling for the person that *does* main champion x in the roll, and you knock him on his ass. These guides are typically written by someone who mains that specific roll and it worked for them. Similarly, if you find you perfrom well in certain rolls on certain champions, keep doing that. Try using lolking to track your status for different lanes and champions.


&gt;Don't flame someone for picking a champion

This is that familiarity thing, but I've seen Fiddlesticks' carry ~1700 games because **they were underestimated**. Maybe that champion is the next hidden OP - it's unlikely, but it happened for Alistar jungle, Olaf, Jax, Malphite, and Eve in quick succession.


&gt;If you don't know what a champion can do, don't be wreckless.

This is why new champs which are easy are ""OP"" and those which are hard are ""bad and should never be picked - omg why you troll"". If they know they can kill you if you make a mistake, and you make a mistake, you're going to die.

&gt;Don't chase Singed

&gt;Wards

These are just positive reinforcement of things y'all know. I hope this in some way helps you guys in season 3 - all the best!",[TIPS],False,self,t5_2t9x3,1352050907.0,tips,,True,t3_12m30s,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/12m30s/for_all_those_in_1200elo_rating_a_word_from_a/,

I lost three ranked games in a row, two of which I feel I played extremely well. Thankfully didn't get demoted back into Silver 4.

So after coming back home (I didn't win in Poker either) my friend, who I just played poker with and knew I was having a rough night, invites me to a game. We played one, get stomped, and he says he's going to invite a friend to fill our open spot. Guess who comes into our lobby.


**NK Inc** 

Somehow, my friend has the ability to befriend pros (He's done this with DoubleLift and someone else who I can't recall) I had been complaining that I couldn't win at League or Poker, and he said he got NK Inc in to help end my losing streak. We get a full 5 people before queuing normals.  I'm a Silver 3, my friend is a Gold 3, and the other two players were Silver 2, and Silver 5.

I will note that every game we played, the other team could not believe they were playing against NK Inc.

___
[Lolking Matches](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20693866#history)  -The last three I played. 

The match where I ""won"" as Zed, was really a loss. We surrendered, but the other team surrendered after we did, which counts as a loss for them. I wanted to legitimately win a game before going to bed.
___

**The Games**

* First game, he's jungle Zed and I'm top Elise against a Vi. He provides solid ganks all around (He had such good flow from lane to lane). Unfortunately, I lose my lane in the end, and tried to go tanky with AP Pen to try and tank for NK. Throughout the game I'd say we were on our heels, and we ended up losing. 

* Next game he plays Vayne, and he really struggled. He apologized in advanced as he doesn't really know how to play Vayne. The other team just had a better team, and we couldn't peel for each other. He ended up split pushing for the last part of the game I feel in part he was getting frustrated with how terrible things went during team fights. 

* Last game, he gets on Skype with us (finally), he asks me to Jungle and he plays Blue Build EZ. Thankfully we're able to peel for EZ and he gets fairly fed. Mid was really struggling that game, despite my efforts to gank like crazy for them. We comfortable win the game finally. 

___
**Realizations**

Now, I've watched a fair amount of LCS, and a little bit of pro streaming soloqueue. I know they have bad games, you can't win every time, but seeing it first hand taught me a few things. 

* You can be on a professional team, and Diamond I soloqueue, and still lose games. I point out the obvious, because I went into the first two games with the mindset that we were automatically going to win. I mean, we have a pro on our team. He's going to stomp wherever he goes right? I was too confident, played sloppily, and ended up hurting my team for the first two games. 

* Lack of communication, even among skilled players, seriously hurts your team. I feel like we would have won all three games if we had everyone in Skype. There were times when we hesitated because my friends and I would say to hit dragon, while NK says to hit a turret. We didn't establish who was the focus, and there were times I didn't know NK was being dived during team fights. 

* When you play when you're stressed out, you're going to make stupid mistakes. Nobody likes to admit it, but when you want to make that Vi pay for killing you no matter what, you're probably going to give her another kill. Realize that there's nothing wrong with taking a break.

To clarify the title, I ended last season at 1519 elo, barely enough for Gold, and I started this season at exactly 1400 elo after the soft reset (roughly Silver II). From there, I played 82 ranked games and reached Diamond V. Here is my lolking profile: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/30719946



For verification, you can see my last mastery page!



I took a long break from ranked after the end of Season 2 since I didn't feel I was meeting my own expectations of being a ""good"" player. A friend gifted me the Augmented Singed skin after we saw the Dark Knight Rises since I kept man-swooning over Bane, so I got really into playing Singed during the preseason. I studied Singed for about half a year before returning to play solo queue ranked, and when I did I played almost exclusively Singed. I did play one game as Jax and two games as Vladimir; my champion pool is not limited to just Singed - I can play a pretty hefty Jayce, Vladimir, Kennen, or Renekton, usually my go-to picks in tournament 5v5 play. That being said, I have played in virtually every matchup possible as Singed, so if you have any general questions about the top lane, feel free to ask. 



The last part of my title is less related to the game itself but more about mood and self health, which I have always found to be just as important as any good mechanics or game knowledge. I consider myself a survivor of ranked anxiety; it took me a very long time to muster up enough courage to even play my first placement match this season, and I still had problems throughout the season with bravery and playing my promotionals across divisions. I got a few nosebleeds and had some difficulty sleeping during my two promotional rounds from Gold I to Plat V. To put things in perspective, I finished my 10 placement matches on March 10 of this year, and only made Diamond V five months later on August 8 - a period of 151 days during which my 82 ranked games were spread across. I am more than welcome to share my experience in dealing with ranked anxiety if it will help other sufferers as well.



Here are some charts and stats I saved throughout my ranked progress, purely for anecdotal examination. The LoLking charts start off at Gold III, which is where I ended up after going 8-2 in my placements: http://imgur.com/a/I55Le#0

## Video Details &amp; Explanations (optional read)




""Custom Key Bindings""
It is best that you find key bindings that work for you personally but I formatted my key bindings to what I feel is a good standard template for all players. The only requirement for these key bindings is a mouse that has a scroll wheel, other than that nothing needs to be purchased meaning my key bindings are friendly to gamers who don't want to dish out any cash as scroll wheels are pretty common on most computers.




[Q][W][E][R], are still linked to the abilities in default order, I placed them in smart + self cast so that players who have multi target abilities can use them to full effect. Lulu's Whimsy is the perfect example as it can be used on Lulu, an Ally, and an Enemy. With smart + self cast she can have immediate access to all of the effects at the touch of one button. Regular casting with the range indicators active is set to [Shift] [Q], [Shift] [W], [Shift] [E], and [Shift] [R] so that players can use regular casting on certain abilities that are difficult to align such as Anivia's glacial wall. Having the range indicator active may slow down the spell speed but the last thing you want is for an Anivia to be ""helping"" your team in a pinch.




The same goes for Summoner Spells, Ignite and other target abilities are instant cast rather than target select casting (default) which in some cases leaves your target alive and can cause some unnecessary deaths. It also allows you to use the summoner spell during channeled abilities while target select may accidentally break the ability. Katarina's Death Lotus can be interrupted if you try to use target select during the ultimate if the target moves out of range because it issued a new command that involves moving. Instant cast removes that issue and will give you a faster kill while still dealing dps.




Camera controls are all the same because they are perfect as they are except for the removal of Camera Lock. Your gameplay drastically improves by unlocking your screen allowing you to see incoming ganks or foresee danger as the enemy is about to set up a play. Some players suggest using the [spacebar] for something other than center camera but it gives most players more control over their character so I choose to leave it as default. It also plays very well with the item key bindings.




Items must be smartcasted for so many reasons that I will not list here. I chose to only use item slots 3,4,5,6 because no character will have more than that many items at any one given point or rather they shouldn't have that many active items.




Item 3 is set to [MB3] (clicking the scroll wheel)
Item 4 is set to [Alt] + [MB3]




The Alt key is directly to the left of the [spacebar] where your thumb will rest for a majority of the game; because you can click [MB3] then quickly hit [Alt] and [MB3] again I like to use these two slots for potions during the early game. Your right index finger no longer needs to left click to activate spells so it can be used to activate the potions while your right middle finger is free to still auto attack and the left hand doesn't leave [Q][W][E][R] to press any buttons. All DPS is still ready to be used and your healing and gaining mana simultaneously. This leads to quite a lot of successful trades and even a kill without having to trade your own life. After use your thumb can also press the space bar and easily retake control of your champion.




Items 5,6 are set to [V] &amp; [T] respectively and are placed here because the [T] Key is right next to your ultimate [R] so once you use your ultimate your left index is free to use the active stored in slot 6 and [V] is right above the [spacebar] and has the same easy access while still keeping close to [spacebar] which will retake control of your champion. I usually put BoTRK or Zhonya's in these slots so I can burst someone with my combo then hit [T] and be safe from all harm or activate God Mode Kiting xD




[S] Key and [H] Key are shifting around, I place the [S] Key as the Attack Champions Only Button which originally is set to [~]. I have no idea why this button is all the way at the top left hand corner and it is no wonder why they key isn't known so much, I place it as [S] because [A] is set to your auto attacks and you can now hold [S] while spamming [A] commands and you will only attack champions. It is wonderful while running through the jungle and it makes flashing so much easier in pinch situations. [S] is originally set to the Stop command which forces your champion to completely do nothing. This command isn't issued often so I decided to set it to [H] which is close to [G] your ping command. If you want to stop to ping your team to wait in a position for a surprise gank then now you can do it with ease.




Keys [1][2][3][4] are now free and open slots since we customized our item slots, I like to use [1][2][3][4] as level up spells [Q][W][E][R] and it allows you to briefly leave your damage spells to level up an ability and can be done so during combat. Prior to this your mouse didn't determine where all your commands went but now it does due to smartcasting and we can't have you using your entire combo towards the bottom of your screen. This allows you to keep your mouse hovered over your objective, be an enemy, a tower, a dragon, a minion, etc, and still power up your abilities. It also allows for quick ult use on lvl 6 which usually determines how a fight will turn out.




Everything else should be left at default and remember to disable all secondary key bindings because you don't want to accidentally use something during an important fight.




""Wards and Flash""




These were primarily something players call ""Safe warding"", these were important laning wards that help you control the lane without putting yourself in a dangerous position. The enemy can't see you place the ward and you are safer even when the enemy is pushed up to your lane. You won't always have access to the river and I wanted to show that every wall has some sort of safe spot to ward from.




The flashes were pretty flat out basic, just I wanted to show you what is possible and what isn't. 
*Warning Some of these flashes are only capable with blink ability champions so be warned that not all of these spots are possible just using flash*

1372848444.0,127,self.summonerschool,1hk652,Effective rune pages: For beginners. A comprehensive guide to having the right runes for the right role.,akigo57,151,24,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1hk652/effective_rune_pages_for_beginners_a/,"**Runes** and Masteries are important parts of any game of League of Legends. Having specific runes can help out your **early,** mid, and late game. It's often asked which runes are best for what, and since I see this question all the time I figured I would go ahead and make a quick post describing **some situations where specific runes will be appropriate.**

.

This post will be divided by roles, and lets go ahead and state outright that other runes can be used per your preference. This 'guide' is based on observation and opinion.

.

**BEST GENERIC RUNES:**

We all know that when you first start out playing league of legends, you get two rune pages... This isn't the ideal number but it's what riot gives us, and if you're forced into a role that you don't have a rune page set up for, you can simply have a rune page set up like this to ensure that you're not running AD quints on a Soraka.

The absolute best generic rune page for any champion:

* 3x Move Speed Quints
* 9x Hybrid Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Glyphs.

This allows you some flexibility. Move speed is great on every champion, and hybrid penetration ensures that you will get SOMETHING for your role, assuming you don't have a page set in advance. Flat armor and magic resist you can never go wrong with.

.

**BEST APC RUNE PAGES:**

An APC is an ability power carry, and their runes will generally reflect their reliance on spells to deal damage.

* 3x Ability Power Quints OR 3x Magic Penetration Quints
* 9x Magic Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Glyphs


This is ideal for most APC champions, specifically casters that go mid lane. Most AP champions value Ability Power Quintessences, however for some Ability Power Champions Magic Penetration Quintessences are more appropriate (Such as Elise.&lt;--- Opinion).

.

**BEST ADC RUNE PAGE:**

ADC champions are attack damage carries, and their runes should reflect their need for early game damage or survivability.

* 3x Attack Damage Quints OR 3x Lifesteal Quints
* 9x Attack Damage Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

This rune setup is ideal for most attack damage champions, especially ranged carries that go bottom lane with a support. This will also work for AD assassins like Zed, Kah' Zix, and Talon. Lifesteal Quintessences are ideal for ""Safe Lanes"" and usually I see points thrown into the Utility Mastery Tree to get the 3% Lifesteal found within.

.

**BEST SUPPORT RUNE PAGE:**

There are several schools of though on the best support runes. Generally safe support lanes will tend to run gold per-10 quintessences. More aggressive lanes may choose to use Armor, Ability Power, or other Quints depending on the champion. Lets stick with the GP-10 for now.

* 3x Gold Per-10 Quints
* 9x Hybrid Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

This will help provide a safe sustained lane, and if you don't manage to get kills or assists the GP-10 is nice. Hybrid Penetration Marks are selected here only because supports can be AD or AP. I generally play AP supports and choose to take Magic Penetration Marks, so that I can scale a little bit of damage in the mid or late game. Hybrid Penetration Marks are ideal on champions such as Sona.

.

**BEST AD JUNGLER RUNE PAGE:**

* 3x Move Speed Quints
* 9x Attack Speed Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

.

**BEST AP JUNGLER RUNE PAGE:**

* 3x Ability Power Quints
* 9x Magic Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

.

**TOP LANE RUNE PAGE:** 

I can't actually suggest specific runes for top lane, simply because the number of top lane champs are so varied and they all generally want specific things to maximize their early game.

.

**Disclaimer** : These are meant to be generic runes for generic roles. Obviously there are some champions like Ryze that will find Ability Power, less than useful. Even more obvious, there will be situations where other, more specific runes are appropriate. If you have questions about specific champions, feel free to ask. Also feel free to expand upon what I have added here.

**Major Edit:

Several people have made the great suggestion that Supports often take Armor Marks, ADCs often take one Crit Rune, some ADC value Armor Penetration more and so on. These are very true, and work very well for specific roles, and specific situations.

I wanted these to be usable by most champions for various things, as the goal was for people who A: Didn't have multiple rune pages and B: Haven't farmed up enough IP to own a full set of all of these runes. That's why I suggest MR glyphs when there are some better ones for specific match-ups.

A mid lane AP champ won't completely suffer for taking AD Marks, because it will help with last hitting. Magic Penetration is probably better to take there, but you can get away with it.

I hope this helps people understand the point of this guide. If people would like the best runes for specific match-ups, get the rune bundle, and only play two-three positions. Because if you're like me, and only have two - three rune pages, and only have them set up for say a life steal, crit chance, ADC or a AP per-level support with GP-10; you're going to be forced to take those mid sometimes when you're last pick, or someone says ""DUO BOT OR FEED"".**",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1372955111.0,,,True,t3_1hk652,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1hk652/effective_rune_pages_for_beginners_a/,

Every second that your opponents are not pushing their advantage is another second that could put you back in the game.

**CAVEAT**: This post applies to competitive (Ranked) play. Surrender in Normals whenever you want; they're supposed to be fun, and if playing from behind isn't fun for you, it's totally reasonable to just move on to the next game and hope that you get luckier.

---

A sub-thread about when to surrender popped up in my [Win quickly, lose slowly](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jwoym/win_quickly_lose_slowly/) thread. Some folks commented:

&gt; Sometimes it is just completely unattainable. Defeat is inevitable. So you surrender to save yourself time.

...

&gt; So you would rather force your will on 4 other people who don't want to play anymore? And besides if your team decides the game is lost, the game is most likely lost anyway, surrender or not.

The problem with this mentality is those games where you're insanely behind, your team is raging at you for voting ""No"", the enemy support is trolling and laying dozens of wards in your base with impunity, your jungler is saying ""It's not stupid of us to surrender, it's selfish of you to waste our time and force us to keep playing""...

... and then you win.

It's happened to me enough times that I'd have to take my shoes off to count it for you.

The problem with this mentality is that *you never know*.

The only time I surrender is when the enemy team literally walks away from our Nexus when it only has a few hits left *just* to draw the game out so they can have more fun being fed. But in pretty much *every other* situation--it's 2 - 18 and they pushed to your inhibitor turrets by 10 minutes--it's still anyone's game.

*If the enemy team plays perfectly*, then yeah, you're not gonna win. **BUT**: it'll be because they close out the game quickly, which means you're only ""wasting"" a few minutes anyway. If they don't close out the game quickly, *anything can happen*.

1. Your jungler might reconnect.
2. Their insanely fed carry might disconnect.
3. They might get sloppy enough for you to catch two of them out and feed the shutdown kills to your carry, for a sudden injection of 1,500 gold to your team and possibly a free baron or dragon.
4. They might have a bad team comp for sieging, allowing you to farm minions at your base until you're caught up.
5. You might not actually be as behind as you think you are.

That's how it is. Everyone bitches about being in Elo hell, where their teammates are awful and don't know how to use an advantage when it gets dropped into their lap. Well, if that's true, it's true for your opponents, too. Either you're in Elo hell and it's overwhelmingly likely that your opponents will eventually throw their advantage, or you're up against a Diamond smurf who's going to wreck your Nexus in a few minutes anyway. But you have to pick one; it can't be both.

I'm gonna tell it to you straight: if you totally check out of a game as soon as it seems like you're not going to win, *you are playing for the wrong reasons*. When you're behind, ask yourself: if I stood up from my computer and a pro player sat down right now, what would they do? The answer is damn near never going to be ""surrender"".

Surrendering because you probably won't win is like bitching about the ""friend zone"". **OH NO**! You connected with another person and made a friend who you can trust and confide in. But you didn't get laid! Guess all that time making a friend was wasted.

*What*?!

This way of thinking is so horribly wrong. Taking the tower as early as safely possible is almost always going to be the better decision. A lost enemy tower provides tremendous amounts of map control. If you manage to take down the enemy's bottom tower early on, you have opened up far greater dragon control than your enemy has. On top of all of this, the earlier you can give your team 150 global gold the better; gold has a far higher value in the early part of the game than later parts.

Plus, especially when a duo lane takes a tower, they can actually switch with a solo lane to further force objectives and take enemy jungle attention. It takes a minimal amount of coordination to do this.

We focused on adc, his primary role. It will take some time for me to mix the video recordings together (mostly a combination of in-game footage + skype), but here are some key points we covered:

 * Part of the reason why you don't see pro smurfs having many bad games (whole team feeding) on stream is because they are such a presence in lane. High elo players on a smurf will often draw the attention of the enemy jungler (and possibly mid) and cause the enemy team to be focused on a particular area. This allows the jungler on the smurf's team to set up ganks in lots of lanes, allows their mid to roam, etc. In other words, if you are creating a strong presence in lane, it is harder for the rest of your team to not be ahead.
 * One way to create lane presence in bot lane is to push the lane (autoattack enemy minions, but still go for last hits). This is risky, but that is why you have to tell your support to ward the tribush. By pushing bot lane, you can force the enemy adc to last hit under tower (and in lower leagues they will miss a lot). In addition, the enemy bot lane will be discouraged from trading because you have more friendly minions with you. Pushing also attracts the enemy jungler to bot lane, and if you have decent warding then the enemy jungler just ends up wasting his time or having to 'lane tax' and take some farm from his own adc.
 * In lower leagues, most supports are 'forced' into their roles and do not understand how to support properly. My coach recommended that I focus on Caitlyn, Graves, and Varus for bronze/silver/low gold because they can dominate a lane even without much support presence.
 * AD Carry needs farm the most. In one game, we took their bot tower at 11 minutes and then my farm started stagnating. I joined 3 others on my team to gank their mid and then take the tower, but in doing so the enemy adc pushed bot and took my bot tower in return. Morrigan said that I need to make the judgment call of when we have 'enough' to take mid or when my team needs me there. The mentality is that during the midgame, you need to be looking for opportunities to farm and pressure. If your team has not taken their outer top tower but is grouping up to do it, decide whether your team has 'enough' for that tower. If so, go find a lane (or jungle) where you can farm so you can keep up your gold-per-minute. If you see the enemy team coming to take out your team after your teammates finish the tower, you obviously need to get over there and help the teamfight, but by not being there in the first place (because your team had 'enough' for the tower), you avoid the common low league issue of having bad adc positioning at the start of the teamfight. By having to 'get there' and not already 'being there', you will enter the teamfight as the last member of your team, which is exactly what you should be doing as adc anyway.

**Lane Positioning**

 * Harass position and safe farm position. Both are used for last hitting. Harass position is standing near the front of your allied minions (and often near the minion the enemy adc is about to cs). If the enemy adc comes to last hit, you shoot them. Safe farm position is exactly what it sounds like - standing behind friendly minions and avoiding exchanges.
 * Your positioning is based on the lane matchup. For example, Vayne should adopt a safe farm position against Draven, simply because Vayne does not win any equal exchange as long as Draven has axes. 
 * The positions are dynamic, not static. Due to the presence of supports, it is often ideal to adopt a 'safe farm' position if the enemy support is trying to harass you. When the enemy support moves back, you can reenter harass position. 
 * Wildturtle is a great example of someone who knows these positions well, especially the harass position. Watch his stream and take note of how he positions in lane.

**I lost my tower early, or I want to create a deep push during midgame without overextending**

 * Slow-rolling. This is when you have a wave pushed to one of your inner towers. Instead of clearing the wave quickly, just last hit. This causes 2-3 waves of friendly minions to build up that will push itself deep into the enemy team's lane. Note that slowrolling takes time and shouldn't be done if the enemy team is pressuring objectives. If the enemy team takes your bot tower very early, you should consider slow-rolling so you can catch up in farm without pushing out too far.

**Why you may suck at trading in lane**

 * Enemy bot lane engages on your support and both of you try to run. If your support is being focused, you should focus on engaging the enemy adc. The same goes for if you are playing support and your adc gets hit. Instead of both of you running away, you need to realize you are not the one being focused and that you have a small window to shoot back.
 * Enemy support and adc stand relatively near each other. The enemy supports shoots you and you shoot him back, but in doing so the enemy adc shoots you. Unless your support is hitting the enemy adc back, you have just lost the trade. The only reason why you should shoot the enemy support back is if he harasses you when the enemy adc cannot follow up. Never take damage for free, although do realize that taking damage from a support and shooting the support back means the enemy adc likely has more health than you and is now slightly ahead.
 * There are more enemy minions than friendly minions, and you trade a shot with the enemy adc. Assuming neither of you are overextended, you have just lost the trade from minion damage. This is also another good reason to push bottom lane.

I'm a high Diamond jungler and I do educational videos over on Youtube (www.youtube.com/foxdroplol) mostly about jungling. I also try to post here to help people out where I can. To that extent, some people value my opinion on jungling topics and I have had many people ask me what my thoughts were on the new champions' ability to jungle. I decided to give an in-depth 'first impressions' explanation. I posted it on my [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/foxdroplol) but thought it might be something SS would find useful- for those of you who can't reach my facebook/don't want to, here are my thoughts: Please be gentle as I was pretty tired when I wrote this and as it was intended for Facebook is holds a fairly informal tone.



So first impressions of Aatrox as a jungler is that he is severely underwhelming. Like, pretty awful. There's so much potential but he just falls flat on his face in most areas to the extent that I could never justify picking him over a lot of other junglers, which is a shame because I was looking forward to enjoying him.

Aatrox as a champion is someone with no middle ground. He is either godly or useless. If he's fed he's unkillable in pretty much any scenario, but if he's weak then he can't do anything and just dies. He is pretty much Trynd. 

His clear speeds are decent but rely on his abilities that cost WAY too much health- 10% on his Q and 5% on his E, plus a flat amount on his W that makes maxing it counter-intuitive (50 hp at rank 5. Who can afford to lose 50 hp everything third hit at level 9?). The %health is also current health, meaning it slaughters you the higher health you are and again means you're more likely to be on lower health when jungling. Compare that to Zac who's abilities all cost 4% of his current health but he drops blobs that heal him for his MAX health, meaning he can actually heal off using his abilities in the jungle.

This means that in order to have competitive clear speeds he needs to sacrifice a lot of HP which brings about some very obvious flaws. Early on, he will rarely be able to show up to ganks with more than 50% HP which makes him extremely vulnerable to just getting insta gibbed by enemy laners. This is ignoring the fact that the enemy jungler can destroy you; even though he is advertised as a dueler that doesn't really shine through until he has some items. Any mediocre dueler can beat him (I'm talking the Fioras let alone the Lee Sins). The health gain on his W is like having your arms chopped off and using a plaster to 'help' it.

His passive (increases Attack Speed) also takes quite a long time to charge, and requires that you use your abilities in order to do so. It forces you to have to go low on health in order to clear decently.

His kit for ganking is ok, but not good enough that you'd say to yourself: ""I need a good ganker, who will I pick? I know, Aatrox!"". He can get the job done but really is nothing special. Any time you rely on chaining together auto attacks for the majority of your damage, you instantly lose a lot of gank pressure because people will just walk away from you. A Q-E combo won't lock someone up for long enough to take them out in the same way that a Rammus would. 

Let's put it this way: Trynd has a better and more reliable gank potential than Aatrox- his Q+E will lock someone up for between 2.75-3.75 seconds (1 second knock up, 1.75-2.75 seconds of a 40% slow). Bear in mind that these are both slow traveling skillshots- his E is a similar speed to a Malphite Q but dodgeable- Trynd on the other hand has a slow on his W that is pretty impossible to miss and lasts for 4 seconds, longer than any combo of Aatrox's even if you max his E. Granted, Aatrox's E does damage and Trynd's W doesn't, but the extra slow duration (more than double early on) is more than enough early to compensate for that.

I found moderate success with Aatrox when I would just sit and farm in the new jungle (yay new jungle). But I was thinking to myself to whole time: ""what benefit am I getting playing this guy over someone like Nocturne?"" I didn't have a good answer for that because, quite simply, there's no point picking him over Noct if you're gonna farm for items.

Aatrox's only saving graces are his Ulti and revive passive. His ult is similar to a Kayle E except it grants Attack Speed instead of extra damage+splash, and it hurts everyone around him when he activates it. It basically beefs him up to the point where he can be pretty scary. If you gank a lane when your ult is up you're pretty much guaranteed a kill- the extra range and AS make landing your W a lot easier which significantly boosts your DPS. But it's not like this gives him an edge over other junglers, as pretty much everyone can get guaranteed kills when their ults are up, especially people like Sejuani who's Ults are also amazing outside of ganking. 

The revive passive means you can get some cheeky tower dives off early on because you drop tower aggro when you're reviving (due to being untargettable), which is unlike Zac's passive where the tower still focuses your blobs, Anivia still focused in egg, etc.

However, I do believe Aatrox has his benefits. As a laner I feel he is extremely strong. He can attack creeps twice and then proc his W on the enemy for some nice poke, he can assist ganks fairly well and is good in skirmishes, and having access to a lot of farm and the potential to get really fed also means he can become ludicrously strong (as with every champ, but highlighted even more so with Aatrox). He'll just stand there destroying your team without dying- he also gets double regen off his W when he's below 50% health, meaning the lower health he is the harder he is to kill. 

Anyway, that's my opinion on him. It's a real shame because I was really looking forward to playing him. Unfortunately I don't think he'll ever be viable in the jungle because it's impossible to balance his jungling while still containing his laning.",Aatrox,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1371184405.0,aatrox,default,True,t3_1gbhqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gbhqf/foxdrops_aatrox_jungle_first_impressions/,

I'm a frequent poster and reader of r/summonerschool - I usually delete my stuff after it gets answered but I've asked over a dozen questions on here as well as Monday megathreads on r/leagueoflegends.

Recently I've noticed that summonerschool has become much less helpful. It is a cesspool of wasted time because most of the threads have no content.

Looking at the front page as I write this:

* TWO threads advertising streams, often by people who are lower than platinum even.
* FOUR people offering or begging for mentorship help, with 0 or 1 comments in all of them.
* THREE guides that boil down to ""be smart, ward, don't rage"" and all say the exact same thing -- no actual content or questions answered or asked. Very few comments, if any, on these posts.
* THREE posts of people complaining about their elo or how riot's tier system work. No question about the actual game answered.
* TWO posts of people begging people to review their replays.
* TWO posts of people asking about technical problems in league, such as how to take a screenshot or how the client is bugged.
* TWO posts asking about ""when to start playing ranked"", a commonly asked question with no real answer.

Of all the posts on the first page, not to mention anything in the next few pages, I count 7 total threads that actually relate to asking or answering questions about in game scenarios or tradeoffs. To give context, my browser renders 25 threads per page. That means barely over 20% of content is what I would consider acceptable, informative content. The other 75% is fluff, wasted space for most, and waters down the subreddit.

I'm sorry if this comes off as complain-y, but I was wondering what steps we might take to mitigate this. I used to love summonerschool when it was less popular (so hipster) because it was very content-filled and informative. 

I am only slightly motivated by the fact that a lot of my recent summonerschool posts, which ask real, serious questions about the metagame, are frequently buried and ignored because of these other types of posts. I've had to delete 4 or 5 questions because I only got troll responses or responses from people who are teh same elo as me (silver), and usually only 1 or 2 comment replies anyway.

Let me know if you feel similarly and what we might be able to do to help solve this problem.

If you want to create pressure in a wave, you can do so by having a large group of friendly minions push against a turret at one point, rather than streams of small groups.

So there's a couple of things to know about minion waves:

* Melee minions have more health than Caster minions

* Melee minions have higher armor than Caster minions

* Melee minions deal less DPS than Caster minions

For all these reasons, if you kill just the caster minions of an enemy wave, your wave won't take much damage, but it will take them a fairly long time to kill off the melee minions of the enemy wave. During this time, your next friendly wave will catch up and you will have a big old wave all in one go. Obviously doing this to 2 consecutive waves will further snowball the wave. 

I'm not sure about how seige minions are to be treated.

Thanks to you all, I've learned how to play every lane so damn well.

**General Notes**


*Top*: I've learned what it means to be a bully and what it means to really just farm under tower. I've learned the importance of CS. Most importantly, I've learned on how to capitalize on advantages. First blood for top? Push that tower and start helping mid and top. As for team fights, depending on my champ, it's my job to peel for the carries and make sure they're safe while I still dish out or absorb damage.

*Mid*: Holy hell, last hitting is so damn crucial and more difficult as an AP caster. However, in between last hitting, simple auto-attacks on the enemy can make a huge difference. Just like top, start pushing and start roaming. Watch that god damn mini-map, you're so easier to gank than Kim Kardashian walking through Harlem. 

*Jungle*: My new home &lt;3 Volibear jungle carried me the hell out of bronze. I don't care about getting fed, I want YOU to get fed. If I can secure my ADC a kill but know that I'll die to tower, but still have the ADC be safe, you sure as hell know that I'll do it. Bronze lacks initiation power, and that's where I found Voli to help me. One small catch, and the fights started. 

*ADC*: I honestly just started acting like Doublelift to get better. I picked up Vayne, imagined everyone besides me to be trash, and didn't give a flying fuck about those two enemy champs in my lane of CS. That's my god damn CS and you will not get in the way of it. If you overstay your welcome, a quick pin to the terrain and true damage will get you out. 

*Support*: Poke enemies, catch skill shots for your ADC, catch the enemy off guard, ward up, initiate the fuck out of the fights. Keep your damn ADC alive. 


I like this quote to sum up ""how to carry out of ELO hell"": *If you want things done right, you gotta do it yourself.* Your team is your friend. But don't expect said friend to give a shit about you or the objectives. You know what needs to be done. Tell your team what to do, make the plays, be the one who sets the tempo. Stop assuming people actually know how to play League of Legends. Only YOU know how to play, so get out there and win that damn game.

1372315016.0,111,self.summonerschool,1h5xe5,Misunderstandings that ADCs have that I've seen many times while smurfing(Silver-Currently Gold) (Diamond I ADC Main)(x-post from r/leagueoflegends),JimsterG,143,32,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1h5xe5/misunderstandings_that_adcs_have_that_ive_seen/,"ADCs in the lower ELO Range around high silver to currently gold seem to be misunderstanding several things about the bottom lane match up and itemization in general.

**1. Last Whisper is a very important item**

The main thing about LW is that it reduces 35% of a target's armor. This allows you to deal significantly more damage to bruisers and tanks. Get this item either second or third depending on your champion or depending on if the opposing team has bruisers with higher than 100 armor. Generally, you want to build it third. I've haven't been seeing ADCs been building this lately and it kinda has been worrying me because they usually do no damage around the 25-30 minute mark.

**2. Prioritize people who are close to you rather than their carries**

I've been seeing a lot of people diving into their team in order to try and kill the opposing team's carry. You don't need to this or rather you shouldn't do this. Leave this job to your bruiser/tank. You will die if you go in too deep and this usually results in a lost fight. If the opposing team's carry is low, and you're still full on HP don't risk dying. You WILL do more damage even if you don't kill the opposing carry due to the fact that they have to back off. Killing the tanks first allow you to get into the main battle much quicker without having to risk yourself, making Last Whisper a very important item.

**3. On the bottom lane match-up, don't be afraid to go all in if you have a stronger 2v2**

I've seen Draven/Fiddles(incredibly broken lane btw) farming in the back and barely even trading hits with the opposing carry. The deciding factor for who usually has the better kill potential depends on the support. If you have a support such as Taric, Leona, Alistar, etc, you will generally have a better kill potential than say a Janna, Sona, Lulu. But if the supports are even in kill potential, then the ADC is the deciding factor on whether or not you want to try to go for the kill. Ezreal, Draven, Graves, etc, have a higher kill potential than Ashe, Vayne, Caitlyn. With champions with low kill potential, you want to trade as much as possible and just play it safe.

Edit#1:

**4. Capitalize on your opponent's mistakes**

This also goes hand in hand with trading during lane. Let's say you're playing Vayne, and the opposing ADC is Ezreal. If he misses a Q, then he loses potential to trade, so your best move would be to go in, hit once, and Q for the extra hit. This is the most standard way to win lane and if you do it better than your opponent, you will win lane 90% of the time. Also, remember when to retreat. Take your gains and don't push too far for more. A bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush. If you burn their summoners, and they retreat to tower then just go back and farm your wave. You will be likely to kill them the next time they return to lane. If they burn their flash ask for a gank or just kill them if your lane has kill potential because they won't be able to get away.

Edit#2:

**5. If the enemy team has an assassin, don't put yourself in a vulnerable position to get nuked**

If the enemy assassin can 100 to 0 you, then it doesn't matter how fed you are. You generally want to run Barrier against assassins if possible. I'm not talking about the small time assassins such as Kass or Ahri or TF, if they even count as assassin. I'm talking about champions like Fizz, LeBlanc, Talon, and Lee Sin(if mid). The type of champions that will kill you within 1-2 seconds. Your best choice is to stay back so you force the enemy mid to dive your front line, which usually does not end up well. Your second option would to be to wait for the assassin to burn their skills on another target and then go join the fight. Remember. Your main priority as the ADC is not to die and dish out as much damage as possible.

Edit: If the assassin waits for you, then just sit back and wait for him to get impatient or for your team to help you.

**6. Don't be afraid to take their tower and not have a place to farm**

I have encountered multiple ADCs that didn't want me to take the tower because they wanted a place to farm. Taking a tower provides three things that help your team. First, it provides 150G for every single person on your team which totals up to 750G. Second, you gain pressure at bottom because you can ward deep and continue to push on the opposing bot lane. Finally, you take away vision from the opposing team which is a huge deal. Do you remember during high level matches or during pro matches that they place down a ward where the tower used to stand or around that area to gain vision? Vision is one of the most important things in the game because the information that they provide and if the enemy team doesn't have that information, they are more likely to make misplays.

Edit#3:

**7.Keeping your CS high is very important through mid game and into late game**

I've seen many ADCs' farm count fall off by the 25 minute mark because they waste so much time in places that they don't need to be. Here's a general rule to follow by. ADC has the highest farm priority in the game so it doesn't matter if you steal CS in other lanes while pushing it. You don't want to leave bot unless your team is forcing a team fight or some objective is being taken. Try to always return to bottom lane after you base because you can always pick up a few cs here and there. If nothing is happening then stay at bottom lane. If the enemy ADC is a lot stronger than you and is currently farming(mid/late game where the ADC farms alone at bot) then let them push and clear the wave then leave. Bottom lane is your home where you should always return to.

the XXX is what you are learning on r/summonerschool, e.g. Last hitting, warding, map awareness, matchups, trading, etc.

Here is how I explain the answer:

From when you begin playing, you learn quickly and play better. Your progress is quick. However, due to the law of diminishing returns, you get better slower and slower until you eventually level off. This is as good as you are going to get by just playing.

Then, you decide that this bronze/silver level of play isnt enough and want to become a better player by consciously focusing on the aspects of the game in which you lack skill. The thing is, when you start learning these new things you will initially play WORSE than you normally do. Since your mind is not used to, for example, constantly checking the minimap, the other facets of your play will suffer.

This is the point where many players give up trying to improve. They think to themselves ""what I was doing before worked better"" and go back to their ""comfort zone""

Only **after** you master one of these skills will your play improve. Then, you can focus on *another* skill.

By SkaterLolPlayer:

&gt;I believe there to be three aspects of League of Legends: psychological, mechanical, and strategic. I don’t care how you spin it; all in-game weaknesses are one of the three, and they’re often times linked.

&gt;Players spend long hours working on their mechanical and strategic skills, but all too many of them completely and utterly ignore the extremely important psychological aspect of the game. It is so incredibly easy for an individual to lose psychologically, and this causing his or her mechanic and strategic abilities to fall apart.

&gt;Example. Early game, your team decides to invade the enemy blue. Your friendly Blitzcrank CV’s an area to find a stray Ahri sitting in a bush. He has the perfect opportunity to hammer her in for an easy first blood. He completely whiffs his hammer, your ADC calls him an idiot, and the invasion is a bust. In this situation, Blitzcrank is likely under a tremendous amount of pressure and feeling enormous anxiety, while the rest of your team is probably the same.

&gt;Here’s a fact of life: nobody performs better in high anxiety situations. Some people claim to do well under pressure, but there is no research indicating that performance increases as anxiety does for anybody. The best professional athletes are the ones who are so deep in the zone of their sports that they don’t even really notice the crowd. Or, if they do, they don’t care that they’re being watched. They may even like the attention.

&gt;This is how winning and losing streaks both occur. When you start winning, you start steamrolling. Your confidence increases, which allows you to stop feeling anxiety and let your already known mechanical skills to take over as automated processes—hitting a skillshot becomes as easy as breathing. And, oppositely, when you go on a losing streak, this is where your mechanical skills fall apart, as you get highly tense and feel an enormous need to play better. People often react to this situation by demanding their bodies to practice more to overcome how bad they’re doing, when in fact it may be time to turn the game off.

&gt;I suggest here that you simply never care about this game. Yes, I know you want to increase your ELO. However actually feeling that you want to increase your ELO will make it harder to do. You, as a player, should honestly never give half a damn about how well a certain game goes or doesn’t go. You should just feel in the zone and enjoy yourself at all times. You should allow your body, and not your mind, to play the game for you.

&gt;How do you do this? How do you become a psychologically sound beast?

&gt;1.) Don’t care about how your team is doing

&gt;If your team is feeding, don’t worry about it. Your harassing them about it is only going to make them play worse. If your top lane Olaf has fed the enemy Irelia to 7-0 by 11 minutes, try to shoot them an “it’s OK! It happens to everybody sometimes.” Whining about it in all chat with little quips like “this Olaf” does absolutely nothing for your team, and will make you a worse player.

&gt;2.) Don’t care about how you’re doing

&gt;If you’re feeding, don’t worry about it. Feeling anxious or shitty about it will only make it worse. If somebody on your team harasses you about it, don’t care about it. One of the worst possible mistakes you can make in this game is actually listening to haters. I’ve been called an idiot or a terrible player in games where I entirely carried my team to victory, getting honored by the opposing team multiple times after. When you allow somebody on your team to get to you, it’s not only on them; it’s on you too. You need to have elephant skin. Again, high anxiety = reduced performance, and reduced performance creates for even higher anxiety. You’re only hurting yourself when you let it get to you. And, chances are, unless you’re like 2600 ELO you’re never going to be playing with these people again. They are insignificant.

&gt;3.) Learn when to call it quits

&gt;I often see very good players continually queue, just game after losing game, getting visibly frustrated on stream. Why do they do this? When the game has turned into something that is a frustrating experience, you need to stop playing for a while. Don’t allow yourself to continue getting angrier and angrier as the game continues to get worse and worse. Log the hell off, do some things to calm you down, and play again later. Your mechanics will never develop like this.

&gt;League of Legends is a fun game, but I honestly feel that the vast majority of the player base does not know how to handle it on a psychological level, despite many people having breathtakingly good mechanics and brilliant strategy. The key I propose is to stop caring about the outcome of any game. Don’t think, feel. Don’t stress, enjoy. A poor mental state will make you bad at the game. I’m talking about anxiety here. Master your psychological state, and you will no longer have good and bad days. You will always play at your best.

&gt;I am not an amazing player. I tend to be between 1350 and 1600 ELO at any given time. If you’re looking for pro advice, I can’t give it to you. If you don’t care for my advice and don’t want to follow it, that’s OK too! Play LoL however you want to play it. I just want people to try and better recognize the psychological part of the game, so if you have your own ideas, post them here. I’m happy to read them with an open mind.

Additionally, although aimed at SC2 it should also apply to LoL: [Anxiety](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Dealing_with_anxiety) (Thanks to Rimmu for suggesting that link!)",[TIPS],False,self,t5_2t9x3,1355061205.0,tips,,True,t3_12o6dy,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/12o6dy/the_psychological_aspect_of_league_of_legends/,

Yep, you read right. Over the past few days I've been playing a lot of solo top Lulu, and let me tell you, its broken as hell. If played right she should dominate her lane and transition well into late game as a peeler/damage dealer.

A quick note before we dive in: a lot of this is personal preference, making it more akin to the guides you'd find on SoloMid than the past jungling Cliff Notes. Any constructive criticism is welcome :)

**Runes**: 9x AS reds, 9x Armour seals, 9x MR/lvl blues, 3x AS quints.

**Masteries**: 21-9-0 is good, but I opt for 26-4-0, grabbing CDR and magic pen in offence and Summoner's Resolve and the armour mastery in defence. Ensure to get all the physical damage masteries either way.

**Skill order**: Take [](/lulu_q) at level one, followed by [](/lulu_e) then [](/lulu_w). Then, you can either max [](/lulu_q) or [](/lulu_e) first. [](/lulu_q) is great for pushing and ganking.

**Items**: Start with [](/bootsofspeed) + 3 [](/healthpotion). Lulu has the slowest base movement speed in the game (tied with a few AD carries), so you really need that little bit extra. Your core items should be [](/berserkersgreaves), [](/wriggleslantern) and [](/witsend). This gives you everything you need to sustain in lane whilst still putting out good damage. Bear in mind that there are other choices for boots, namely [](/mercurystreads) and [](/ninjatabi). After that, you're really flexible. A [](/trinityforce) is always good considering how low the cooldowns on your spells are and how good your chasing power is. The movement speed is very welcome too. [](/hextechgunblade), whilst expensive, caters for most of your needs as well, and gives your skills a bit more of a punch. If you find yourself having to initiate, [](/randuinsomen) is really strong, especially when coupled with [](/lulu_r). [](/phantomdancer) is great for that aforementioned movement speed, and as usual, [](/atmasimpaler) [](/warmogsarmor) is stronk. [](/forceofnature) or [](/bansheesveil) if you need MR.

**General tips**

For laning with Lulu, you should have one thing on your mind: AGGRESSION!! If well played, Lulu can win lane against literally anyone. [](/leesin) [](/renekton) [](/kennen), I've had them all. Your autoattack harass is insane, and with the runes I said you should be hitting ~0.8 AS, allowing you to pull off constant poke. [](/lulu_q) and [](/lulu_e) have very high base damage, and when used in an EQ combo, deals heavy damage and sets up for a string of autoattacks. With the speed boost on [](/lulu_w) and the 80% slow on [](/lulu_q), you're gonna be very hard to gank, which means you can extend a little more than usual (BUT DON'T BE DUMB YO). Push the lane out with [](/lulu_q) and gank mid. Keep their blue warded if you're on purple side. Push to tower and take their golems if you're on blue (AGAIN DON'T BE A RETARD). During teamfights, use [](/lulu_r) on the initiator, or instead on someone who needs to stick on to people/is easily kited. [](/riven) and [](/udyr) are prime candidates. If you're initiating, use it on yourself with the active of [](/randuinsomen), as mentioned earlier. [](/lulu_w) their carry (AP or AD, whoever's a bigger threat), or if you don't care and want to be a man, use it on your AP carry. Shield when appropriate, and constantly churn out [](/lulu_q) for significant AoE damage.

EDIT: [Here](http://www.mediafire.com/?avg54m2v35w98nv) and [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?lnh3z71o3j3g9ij) are two replays of me playing solo top Lulu, first against Amumu and second against Teemo. They both showcase her laning power, in particular how easily she can kill her opponent (See: Teemo game during the dive for kill #4) and how well she can poke.

Think that's it.

Hopefully it's slightly informative, but it is a rant nonetheless.  Below is a list of things that I, as a jungler, want YOU, as a laner, to be aware of.

1. ""Leashing"" has changed since S2.  One auto-attack from the mid-laner just doesn't cut it anymore.  I use about 2 extra potions on a smiteless start if you don't stay around to damage my buff.  3 CS in your lane is not worth the risk of me not being able to level 2/3 gank.

2.  If I start at blue, anyone not at blue should ideally be watching the entrances to my red buff.  SAFELY.  There are exceptions to this, such as a Taric/ADC lane trying for a cheezy level 1 kill in the lane brush.

3.  If I encounter the enemy jungler in our jungle you should come help if possible.  Those frantic pings are for a reason.  He's in our territory and should be treated just like a trespasser in Texas.

4.  If I have more CS than the laners at the 10 minute mark then we have a problem.

5.  If you're 0/3 when the second blue buff comes up, I'm probably not going to give it to you since you'll probably just donate it to the enemy midlaner/jungler anyway.

In addition, here are a few reasons why I might be less-inclined to gank your lane.

1.  I already ""ganked"" your lane, after giving you a heads up in chat and then pinging furiously, only to have you stay helpfully out of range while I chase the enemy jungler to his turret alone.  Bonus points if you continue CSing while I'm ""ganking""

2.  You don't have a single ward and the enemy jungler is MIA.  I REALLY don't want to give up a double kill to the top-laner in addition to the double assist Lee Sin just got.

3.  You've fed Darius 5 kills by 15 minutes.  There's a very real possibility he can 1v2 us, and I need to focus on lanes that have a shot anyway.

4.  You pushed your lane to the opposing turret.  I'm not diving at level 4.  If I have confidence in you I'll try to set up a lane-gank.

5.  You complain that I don't gank bot immediately after I secure a level 2 kill in top lane.

- **Who are we?**  
We are a group of League of Legends players who are happy and willing to give assistance to anyone who asks for it. If you have never played a MOBA before, start here. Post a thread requesting help, and in it give brief details as to your timezone, times you can play, and the kind of help you need.  
People who fit the description you request can and will say so on your post. Pick somebody (or several somebodies) and message them asking for their teachings, and learn away! Otherwise, see above for a list of people willing to help at anytime, and are open to being asked for help whenever.  
Anybody is welcome to ask for help, and everybody has something they can learn. We have a lot of advanced, high Elo players who are willing to teach, so don't be afraid to ask for high-level assistance!

[This post from Kuenaimaku](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/sou33/couldnt_find_a_dictionary/c4frgx6) is quite good for new players as well, and can clear up some basic questions.

The gold awarded is not always the same, so its good to know, if a little bit more advanced than some of these other guides.  
  
- If you are new it is a good idea to do the tutorial mission. Not only does it cover quite a few of the basics, but you get nearly 500 IP from a 10-15 minute game, which is enough to unlock another champion permanently. From here, picking one of the free champs you like the look of is a good way to start. Load up a custom game with one bot on the enemy team and try out the champ, testing out all the skills and getting the hang of them. Then try them out in a coop vs. AI game and see how you do!  
  
- The general consensus about runes is to not worry about them until you hit level 20. The tier 3 (and best) runes are unlocked when you hit 20, so anything you got before then just becomes obsolete. Spend your early IP on a couple of cheap champions, don't buy anyone expensive until they become free and you play them. 
With masteries, its a good idea to put the first couple you get into the Summoner Spell masteries, because these are pretty good and help you out a little bit. I would say sinking the rest into the flat MR/Armor masteries until you get past level 7. [This ](http://i.imgur.com/YT7vq.png) is a great little flow chart for which runes to buy for which purpose.

- **What do all these badges mean?**
We have a pretty cool flair system implemented here, and you will see various people around with badges on the subreddit. The number badges are assigned based on that players current feedback score. Whenever somebody teaches somebody else, say for a few games together or some intensive theorycrafting, the student messages me and I give the teacher a badge.
There are a few other badges; the caster badge is for people who shoutcast in-house games or for the SNSS, the book badge is for people who have written a 'Guide of the Week', the Mod badge, and a slew of individual badges that have been made for special individuals.

- **LoL Icons in Comments**  
The mod Kuenaimaku put together a massive amount of code, resulting in us being able to use every single champion icon, mastery/summoner spell icon, and item icon in comments, with very easy code. They can be entered very easily, for example:  
  
\[](/udyr) = [](/udyr)  
\[](/frozenmallet) = [](/frozenmallet)  
  
Even better, if we add some text after the icon name, it shows up when you hover over the picture:  
  
\[](/urgot ""Urgot to be kidding me"") = [](/urgot ""Urgot to be kidding me"")  
\[](/trinityforce ""Tons of damage"") = [](/trinityforce ""Tons of damage"")

- **Tagging Posts on the sub**  
You will see some coloured posts around the place, and these are done by simply adding [VIDEO], [HELP] or [GUIDE] to your post. There will be more tags coming.

Start without items and head to midlane. You can get a max of 114 CS from lane by 10 minutes. Challenge yourself to get up to 100 without any distractions. Go on. Try it. I'll wait.

Not so easy was it?

Now throw in a bot and see if you can juggle harassing, last-hitting, and not dying. Before you know it, you'll be seeing real results on how to outfarm your opponent in game, as well as get more comfortable with the damage output of your champ.

[Link to part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/p3win/a_basic_rundown_of_all_the_champions_master_yi/)

* **Ahri**: Plays AP mid. She's a burst caster with a really strong cc that can lead to kills. Has really good sustain, but a pretty high skill cap.
* **Akali**: Plays any solo lane. Burst assassin with a long range jump that deals tons of damage. Not mana dependent, so has really good sustain in conjunction with her passive.
* **Alistar**: Played as a support. A cc machine that has a weak, spammable heal. Very good with Vayne because combined cc. His ult gives him a lot of damage resistance that lets him just sit in the middle of teamfights and tank.
* **Amumu**: Excellent jungler. Has a lot of cc and a % of health AoE. His ult is a god and teamfights and does huge burst damage.
* **Anivia**: Great AP mid. Good Anivias wont die because of egg form. AoE slow and a nice stun with a lot of damage. Moderately high skill cap.
* **Annie** : AP mid that isn't that strong compared to the rest. Without ult can't 100-0 much, but with ult can 1-shot a lot of squishies. Has a non very reliable stun, but can coordinate ganks very well.
* **Ashe**: AD carry that has fallen off compared to the new ones. Infinite slow with auto attacks, but no gap closer/escape makes her lose to all the other AD carries. If played properly is still a super strong pick with one of the best initiates.
* **Blitzcrank**: Normally played support. Very strong kill potential with grab and knock up. AoE silence gives huge edge in team fights. A very strong pick currently.
* **Brand**: Strong burst caster. Has % of health damage on each of his spells, and his ult hits really hard in teamfights. If combo isn't successful can't do that much, and has no reliable escape.
* **Caitlyn**: Very strong AD carry. Probably the BEST early game of all the bottom lane carries currently. Really good at farming and has a lot of damage with Headshot. Not as hypercarry as Vayne, but still really strong.
* **Cassiopeia**: Very strong AP mid. Not that much sustain, but a VERY good ult (buggy at times). A high skill cap, but still a strong pick.
* **Cho'Gath**: Safe top lane pick. Passive lets hit sit in lane and farm all day, and has some nice cc as well as a huge burst for ult, and can exchange very well.
* **Corki**: A good AD carry pick. His only real weakness is that he has to be in peoples face to get the full damage off, but 10% true damage on attacks make him really strong.
* **Dr. Mundo**: Somewhat weak currently. Been recently buffed and clears jungle really fast. Bad early game, but if stays on par until late game has huge potential to wreck.
* **Evelynn**: Very weak in the current meta. Doesn't fit into a specific role, and can't do much during team fights. Better for lower ELO where nobody wards and gets oracles, but not that great of a pick.
* **Ezreal**: A so-so AD carry. Doesn't have that much damage, but has a  free flash that lets him chase really well. His passive gives good synergy and is ult is pretty strong. Still a viable pick, but is somewhat outclassed by the hyper carries.
* **Fiddlesticks**: AP mid but more commonly jungler. With the recent arrival of a ton of AoE junglers, he has fallen off recently, but still really great post-6 ganks and can insta-fear people to kill them quickly.
* **Fiora**: Okay top laner and jungler. Decent clear times in the jungle, and VERY good at fighting people in little skirmishes. Good kit for pushing turrets, and can turn around a team really quickly.
* **Fizz**: Strong AP mid choice wil pretty high skill cap. Once mid game starts, he really starts to deal damage, but he needs to survive early game. Gets outclassed by a lot of mids but can still be a strong pick.
* **Galio**: AP mid that has a lot of farming potential. Can be really tanky with MR (which turns to AP), and some armor and health. Very very good ult for team fights, and beats a bunch of mids because of natural MR.
* **Gangplank**: Solo top jungle mid AD carry or support. Seriously this guy can play any role well... But he just facerolls solo top early game. Just press Q and farm minions and he'll win. Global ult that slows is super strong, and he can just sit in lane forever.
* **Garen**: Great solo top pick. Can just sit in lane and farm, and doesn't depend on mana, so can sustain forever. His passive makes him not leave lane forever, either.
* **Gragas**: Strong AP mid pick. Has a LOT of lane sustain and his ult is a god in teamfights if placed properly. Has a decently high skill cap, but can farm very well and just stay in lane forever.
* **Graves**: Excellent AD carry. He can just sit there in lane and farm while being able to exchange with almost anyone with his q. Very strong throughout the entire game, but needs to be pretty farmed.\\
* **Hecarim**: Decent jungler. Good clear times and ganks. Strong initiate ultimate that is somewhat hard to use. Can be very dangerous if built bruiser, or very troll if build dunkmaster, as he scales with movespeed. Pretty fun to play (if you like spinning and moving quickly), but overall meh at the moment.
* **Heimerdinger**: Pretty weak currently. Without turrets he's not very strong 1 on 1, and his rockets is the only reliable damage source. Very difficult skillshot stun/blind makes him hard to do well consistently with. Overall amazing farmer, but weak pick. Fun as heck to play, though.
* **Irelia**: Very safe solo top. Doesn't need to leave lane and can farm very well. By mid game has a lot of damage, and is pretty tanky. Currently very strong in the meta, but has a few hard counters.
* **Janna**: Very good support. Shield gives AD for the carry, and has good cc (knockup and slow). Her passive buff helps entire team, and her ult can be used for positioning in teamfights. One of the best supports currently.
* **Jarvan IV**: Strong jungler with decent ganks. His ult pretty much isolates 1 person, and can be used to initiate and pick up kills. Not as strong as other junglers, but still good.
* **Jax**: Recently changed completely. Still good solo top, but now a viable jungle. Can dodge all autoattacks for a few seconds, and has a good gap closer and can deal tons of damage. Underestimated and strong pick.
* **Karma**: A meh support all around. Good Karma's are amazing, but meh Karma's just don't do enough. Has good potential, but very high skill cap making her a bad pick.
* **Karthus**: Very strong mid. Has great harrass and can clear waves and sustain for a very long time. Can just suicide and press R to win teamfights, and is very powerful.
* **Kassadin**: Another strong mid. Has good CC and can chase very easily. Very good burst assassin, but can also be built as a bruiser. Overall great pick.
* **Katarina**: Good mid that isn't mana reliant. Passive + ult can lead to teamfight victories, but 1 tiny bit of CC and she's useless. Overall moderate pick.
* **Kayle**: Not very good currently. Although her ult is a god, she doesn't do all that much otherwise, and doesn't fill the support role as well as others.
* **Kennen**: Amazing solo laner. Not mana dependent, and can sit in lane forever. Nothing hard counters him, and he has excellent CC for teamfights.
* **Kog'Maw**: Great AD carry. Very long range + % of health auto attacks give him and excellent late game, but a pretty bad early game. Overall decent pick for an AD carry.
* **Leblanc**: Extremely powerful mid. Can 100-0 and 1 shot almost anyone. Has one of the best early games of any champion, and if played right stays powerful all game.
* **Lee Sin**: Very strong jungler and solo top. Probably the best jungler right now, but has a moderately high skill cap. He can do tons of damage, and has great escapes. His ganks are very strong, and he's an amazing pick.
* **Leona**: A good support with a lot of cc. Her passive lets her and her AD carry do a bunch of damage, and she can cc very well during teamfights. Overall good pick, but outclassed by many supports.
* **Lulu**: A strong, aggressive support and/or AP caster. Works very well top lane in a double AP comp if played as an AP carry. Very powerful ultimate and strong slow, along with the coolest cc in the game, polymorph (hex from wc3/dota). Very decision based, she must decide whether or not to have more survivability in fights or more damage. Overall good pick for top mid or support.
* **Lux**: A decent support and AP mid. She has some good cc that can lead to strong ganks and exchanges. Her ult is funny, and she's an overall good pick.
* **Malphite**: Good solo top and jungler. Although he's outclassed during early game, he has an amazing initiate that can lead to a teamfight victory. A safe pick for top lane.
* **Malzahar**: A stong mid pick. Without innate escape tools, though, he's fallen off the totem pole. A very good ult and AoE makes him a tank killer, and he clears waves very fast.
* **Maokai**: Strong jungler and decent top lane. Clears the jungle pretty fast, and has good ganks with his gap closer snare. Very strong pick currently.

1366579042.0,110,self.summonerschool,1ctkup,Itemization Optimization for AD Carry Guide,Chzeburashka,125,15,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ctkup/itemization_optimization_for_ad_carry_guide/,"**Optimal Itemization for AD Carries according to their kits**

**Abbreviation Key:** 

*AD* = Attack Damage

*BT* = Bloodthirster

*IE* = Infinity Edge

*PD* = Phantom Dancer

*Shiv* = Statikk Shiv

*LW* = Last Whisper

*BotRK* = Blade of the Ruined King


In most games an *AD* carry won't get past building 3 or 4 core items. With this being the case, I think it's very important to optimize itemization according to a carry's kit. The first item will (almost) always be one made out of a BF Sword (*IE* or *BT*) and the second will be made out of a zeal (*PD/Shiv*). The 3rd is generally Last Whisper, as at the time of purchase enemies will start stacking resistances. 

There's also the more recent but somewhat strange build of *BotRK &gt; IE &gt; LW*, in which case the attack speed item (or upgraded zeal item) rules will still apply, but as a 4th or 5th item. 

It's also worth noting that *BotRK* should be thought of as a replacement for *BT* as it is a non-*AD* heavy option for lifesteal.

I'll also add that there's no defensive item section here because they have nothing to do with an AD Carry's kit (maybe an argument could be made for Warmog's being best on Graves because of his passive...but that's kinda lame). Defensive purchases are REACTIVE and should be purchased when needed according to what the ENEMY team is composed of in terms of champions.

**Initial core variation**


1. *BT/IE*
2. *PD/Shiv*


**BT First Champions**: Basically their kits scale well off of *AD*. 

This could mean that either they have high *AD* scaling abilities 
(Graves, Caitlyn, Miss Fortune, Sivir) AND OR strong scaling Auto attack modifiers (Draven, Vayne, Caitlyn)

The following champions should build BT first according to qualities listed above: 

-Caitlyn (passive Q and R scale), Draven (Q, E, and R), Ezreal (Q and R), Graves (Q and R), Miss Fortune (Q and R), Sivir (Q and W), Varus (Q and E), Vayne (Q and E)

**IE or BotRK first Champions:**
These champions basically have either no or very little *AD* scaling, and are strong because of more inherent parts of their kits (their range mostly)

-Ashe, Kog Maw, Tristana, Twitch

**PD Second Champions:** A champion would prefer having a phantom dancer if (and only if) they have an auto attack modifier (or an enhanced auto attack) in which case a higher % crit chance 
will add more to his or her overall damage output

-Caitlyn (her passive), Draven (his Q), MF (her Q), Sivir (her W), Twitch (his R), Vayne (her Q and R)

**Shiv Second Champions:** Static Shiv is an item that somewhat shores up the weaknesses of non-*AD* scaling carries by providing damage that scales with attackspeed. Note that choosing this item leaves you with less attack speed and Critical strike chance than *PD*, which is a non-issue if your champion does not have Auto attack modifiers

-Ashe, Ezreal, Graves, Kog'Maw, Tristana, Twitch (Has weird strong interaction because of his R), Varus

**Ugly Duckling AD Carries that don't follow the rules**: Ezreal, Corki, Quinn

*Note that these champions can still be built according the mentioned item cores, but because of the strangeness of their kits, the cost-effectiveness of these builds might be lessened.*

Ezreal is the only duckling of these three that is good in his ugliness. He can build just about any *AD* item and get away with it.

Corki is in a bad place right now. He has mediocre AD scaling, no inherent attackspeed, his passive does not scalle off of critical strikes, and his spells all deal magic damage.

Quinn feels more like a solotop to me and most. Her kit has a high number of skills that scale with *AD*, but the scaling itself is so poor that she can't get away with purchasing *BT* first and has to go for *BotRK* or *IE* first. And even though her passive counts as an auto attack modifier, her kit has so much mobility that Shiv is a better option than PD. 

**Complete variation in no particular purchasing order:**

*IE* &lt;AND&gt; *LW* (CORE, should always purchased EVENTUALLY),* PD* &lt;OR&gt; *Shiv*, *BT* &lt;OR&gt; *BotRK*

**Quick Lookup builds according to champion** (See above for explanation)

These are basic 4 item cores that use our knowledge of the champion's kits above. 

Note that the buying ORDER presented below might vary slightly according to each 
champion's unique kit, but that the ITEMS themselves should not vary. 

You should also keep in mind that Last Whisper IS a core item for ALL AD carries, but should be 
purchased reactively WHEN the enemy team starts stacking armor. 



[](/ashe) **Ashe**  - *IE, Shiv, LW, BotRK*


[](/caitlyn) **Caitlyn** - *BT, PD, LW, IE* (Now, personally, I prefer going IE on Caitlyn first. The only reason I put BT is because the numbers are THERE and it's hard to argue with numbers :c)

[](/corki) **Corki** - *IE, Shiv, LW, BotRK* (He has stranger build options, but this one should work as a standard build from the parameters listed. Other items include Trinity Force and Manamune)

[](/draven) **Draven** - *BT, PD, LW, IE*

[](/ezreal) **Ezreal** - *BT, Shiv, LW, IE* (Ezreal's kit lends itself to some interesting item variation, such as Manamune, Iceborn Gauntlet and Spirit of the Lizard Elder as seen recently in the LCS)

[](/graves) **Graves** - *BT, Shiv, LW, IE*

[](/kogmaw) **Kog'Maw** - *BotRK, Shiv, IE, LW* (Note that *LW* is last and the two on-hit items are first. Kog' Maw's W allows him to itemize for more attack-speed oriented items first, but BotRK also gives him an additional slow, which shores up his weakness of not having an escape)

[](/missfortune) **Miss Fortune** - *BT, PD, LW, IE* (Miss Fortune is also a prime candidate for building Black Cleaver, because her R is incredibly effective at applying the armor shred to an entire enemy team)

[](/quinn) **Quinn** - *BotRK, Shiv, IE, LW* (Strange champion, slight order variation. LW would be purchased fourth due to kit weakness and a longer build-up time on damage)

[](/sivir) **Sivir** - *BT, PD, LW, IE*

[](/tristana) **Tristana** - *BotRK, IE, Shiv, LW* (*BotRK* first is ideal, but the last 2 items should be purchased according to the enemy's items. Higher armor would warrant *LW* as 3rd item)

[](/twitch) **Twitch** - *BotRK, IE, LW, Shiv* or *PD* (Twitch's R stacks and restacks the *Shiv* quickly but it is also an auto attack modifier that crits for monstrously high numbers)

[](/varus) **Varus** - *BT, Shiv, LW, IE* (Varus is also free to build *BotRK*, because of the % damage on-hit on his W; The % current health damage from BotRK drops the enemy low, while the % total damage from proccing W drops the enemy dead)

[](/vayne) **Vayne** -* BT, PD, LW, IE* (Vayne's W is very similar to that of Varus, so rushing BotRK is great option on her as well)

1347899116.0,103,self.summonerschool,10113i,A Guide to Early Ranked Play - Part 1,Fenrils,122,19,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/10113i/a_guide_to_early_ranked_play_part_1/,"Hello everyone.  I am Fenrils (ign F3nr1s) and I am here to help you all out with ranked play.  I am by no means a pro player but I do feel I can give plenty of insight to players just starting out ranked play or those that wish to increase their own skill at this game.  This guide is part one to what will hopefully be a series of guides (if everyone likes it and wants more).  Why should you listen to me and at least try out some of my advice?  I have been playing League of Legends since the end of closed beta a few years ago, before that I spent several years playing DotA (and many other MOBA counterparts), and have around 1700 ranked games under my belt over the past two seasons.  My ranked stats hover between 1700 and 1750 elo at the moment but I will hopefully be of platinum rank by the end of this season.  Besides ranked stats, I have about 1100 normal games played and many, many custom matches such as ARAM, in-houses, and LAN tournaments.  Although I may not be as good as the pros, I can at least help you all on the beginning of your journey through ranked play.

Let's get started then shall we?  This post, being the first part to the series, is going to focus on an introduction to ranked play.  Even if you have been playing ranked for awhile, if you are under 1200 elo at the moment I would suggest you keep reading as you may learn something along the way. 

As a newly level 30 summoner, you have finally gained access to the ability to play in ranked matches and thus prove your inherent skill in the game by obtaining visible stats for your account.  While you can go immediately into your ranked career, I would suggest you hold on for a small time before starting.  Not to say you are not ready for ranked, but rather take an inventory of what exactly you will need for truly effective ranked play.  First and foremost, you need to have two roles you are comfortable playing and at least three champions in those roles are are confident you can perform well with.  The interesting thing about ranked is that to get up to the middle tier (1600+) you are best off having a specialty you are very good with.  At that point you should become more of a generalist that can carry from a few more different roles until you hit high elo (1950+) at which point you become more of a specialist once more.

All that said, we are going to focus on the two roles you wish to play.  You will have probably noticed throughout your thirty levels of normal play that you tended to drift towards one role, or even a few champions, more than the others.  Look at those and find the continuity between them.  Are they mostly AD carries? Junglers? Are you the rare support player?  Find your niche, then look at a backup role you can do somewhat well with.  This is a point that I see so many players screwing up.  People look at the pros and the supposed “champion tiers” and make their choices off of that.  This is possibly the worst thing you could do to your stats.  Play what you love and are most comfortable with.  You will do much better and increase your elo much faster and more consistently playing champions you are inherently good with rather than the ones everyone else says is “the best.”  I have had my sorry butt carried through many games by the talented Viktor, Akali, and Tryndamere players.  All of them are in theory sub-par champions but their players were good, practiced, and took advantage of that.  

After this decision, go to your rune pages.  I do not have time to go over the optimal rune pages for every champion in every role but I will suggest a few methods of finding and determining such a thing.  Solomid.net, clgaming.net, and lolpro.com all have an assortment of guides that are written by the pros or just very talented players.  Read them and take in the information they give as it is more often than not better advice than what you would get on forums or reddit.  Despite that, take their advice with a grain of salt.  Runes and masteries can typically be copied 100% but the item builds are where we may make a few changes.  The item builds they recommend assume you can farm like a pro (100+ cs per 10 mins plus gold from kills.)  What this means is that they are not necessarily the optimal build for your skill level.  You may need to take some mid games items they ignore or change the item progression to fit your style and farm capabilities.  

If you know your roles, have your rune pages, and are comfortable with where you sit in terms of skill level then you are almost ready.  The next part is really an understanding of what you are getting yourself into when you queue up for ranked play.  Your first ten games are called your placement matches.  While you may be able to see what rating you are effectively in at the time, your elo will not show up on your profile until these ten matches are completed.  Do not be surprised if you lose or gain 40-50 elo per match for these first ten.  The game is attempting to determine where your true elo is at that time.  This is where psychology ruins potentially very good players.  Many people will see a few early losses and see their rating tank.  At that point they give up trying their best or even ranked play altogether.  Don't ever do this.  Ignore your rating.  It is just a number and it can always change.  I cannot emphasize this idea enough.  Just because you are sitting at an elo you do not like does not mean you are stuck there forever.  Keep trying and keep playing.  If you lose a few games in a row then the best thing you can do is to take a break.  Watch a TV show, go for a walk, grab some food, do something else.  You will regret it the next day if you keep playing because you will most likely lose more and thus decrease your elo even more.  Your mind says you will lose so you will subconsciously play at a lower level in order to prove yourself correct.  

The last addition to your mindset that you should remember is how to interact with other players.  If people rage, blame you, insult you, or anything then just ignore them.  The worst thing you could possibly do is retaliate.  Use your mute button liberally and silently.  Don't tell them you are muting or reporting them, just do it.  Don't ever outright blame your teammates.  More often than not this just creates turmoil in the team and will slowly but surely depreciate your chances of winning.  How many games have you won with your team yelling at each other?  Not very many I bet.  Instead, look at your own play.  Analyze what went wrong and how it could have been fixed.  Look back at all the mistakes you made and see how you could have improved a situation and possibly won a lane or a game.  I am a firm believer that 99% of all games played can be won by either team at any time if they just get their shit together, play to perfection, and exploit their opponents.  But now I am getting into the next part of this series which will be lane dominance, catching up, and rules of the rift.

If you guys think I missed anything or had any followup questions about the introduction, please ask away in the comments and I, or anyone else, can hopefully help you out.

1342533955.0,104,self.summonerschool,wp9af,For those who want to get better at support: Here is what goes through my head when i'm playing.,crunchyCal,116,12,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/wp9af/for_those_who_want_to_get_better_at_support_here/,"playing support in ranked is infurating if your AD cant last hit well. I LOVE playing support, but often don't because i'm scared that our AD can't last hit. Especially around 1200 elo. once you get up to 1300-1400, it's even worse because if your AD can't last hit and if theirs can, you can automatically lose the lane if you play passive. 

Therefore, i always try and counterpick supports. What do i mean by this?

depending on how strong/weak your AD is early game (ashe vs graves, or kog vs corki----burst damage vs no burst), you have to pick a support to make up for it. If i see someone going corki alistar or taric corki, i'll know to pick a hero that can PROACTIVELY deter them from going incredibly aggressive on my ADC.

what do i mean by proactively? i mean someone who is able to pressure by auto attacking and forcing their ADC to react, rather than have them be aggressive and us responding. 

get good at zoning. get good at knowing when to control brush and knowing when to control river side. (when their support is in the bushes, go river side to get an angle where you can harass their AD with auto attacks if ranged. force their support to stop camping the bush. Remember, if their AD is being pressured by you, your FORCING them to actively choose between CS'ING and COUNTER HARASSiNG.)

Know when to be aggressive and when to play passive. Do they have an enemy jungler that has a strong level 2 gank? how about level 4? does he start red?

Do micro calculations about trades- can you win a trade? How low is the enemy supports mana? Can we force potions on their AD? Can we force the enemy AD to waste mana? Do they have enough for a burst?

See that alistar? he's going to want to stalk the bushes and wait for a chance to headbutt pulverize so his lanemate can get off free harass. How can i actively stop him?

First off there are two important keys here: Alistar has sustain, so he will always want to trade.

Alistar likes bushes

What can we do? Start 1 sight ward and 1 pink ward. Ask your AD to last hit well, but also push the lane a bit so your never forced to sit at tower. If they can't push, you can help them with auto attacks. 

Sight ward the FAR bush and auto attack alitar if he gets within range. If he wards the CLOSE bush, pink ward and kill it. Bush sight is important if he wants to get off his combo. Be sure to constantly harass him when he gets in range, to force him to stay a bit further back. This relieves a lot of the potential threat. If alistar is out of position, he can't kill you.

Once we've established dominance over alistar, we can move onto part two of winning the lane- screw up the enemy ADC.

are my bushes warded? check. 
Is the enemy jungle not going to be near bot anytime soon? Check.
it's time to be aggressive. Where do we choose to be aggressive from? the RIVER side of the lane. Why? Less walls, more escape options, and better angling. Also, our sight wards allows us to tell if alistar is moving in for a kill, and we can back off.

What should our AD be doing this whole time? farming and following up on any potential aggression.

So the solution to an alistar lane would be picking someone like soraka, janna, sona, lux, morgana. 

Leona is very similar to alistar, that if they go in, it's to CC and burst you down. however, leona has no sustain and has to go ""all in"" in order to do so. You can zone her the same way you zone alistar. They key to negating aggression is to be aggressive yourself. Make use of river side to harass their ADC and stay out of range of the bush aggression. 


What about facing soraka? or janna? or lux?
Soraka lanes are inheretly boring. However, soraka can make BIG plays with her bananas. maybe one, two, or three of them don't hurt. but 10? 20? it adds up.

so how do we counter pick this? Well we know that soraka has nothing other than silence and auto attack harass, both which aren't incredibly damaging. However, she has no hard CC, leading us to make one decision.

Focus the enemy ADC, make him screw up and be scared for his life. Take ignite and use it early in order to make him burn pots and establish lane dominance.

What do i mean make him screw up? 
if i'm playing a melee with a combo (taric, alistar, leona), i can always fake aggression.

Fake aggression: the act of running towards the enemy ADC threatening to stun or otherwise damage when the enemy ADC is going for a last hit. They have to make a split second decision whether to risk taking a chunk of damage from my combo or getting that one cs.

the most vulnerable time to harass and be aggressive is after the armor buff from sorakas heal wears off. Remember, it has a very high cooldown. Those 15 seconds are your time to shine.

How about janna? the QUEEN of support?

i hate playing against janna, and love playing as her. Why? because she can make BIG plays. just like i recommend alistar, janna is excellent at making plays. her auto attack animation is smooth, her shield allows you to negate a LOT of harass. her W is one of the best harassing tools in the game (W-auto auto auto) and her passive is OP. As a hero, she has such a huge skill cap potential.

Some janna tricks: use your q-q instantly, don't wait for it to charge up. Dont use it to harass, but use it REACTIVELY. use your W to harass in lane, and shield to win trades. use your Q when the enemy goes aggressive onto you or your lane mate, and use it when your going aggressive. The hitbox on Q is HUGE, so you can always angle it to hit someone who is running away.

your R is one of the best disengages in the game- don't be afraid to use it. Also, dont be afraid to sit there and heal for a bit- the knockback has a ministun effect where the opponent can't automaticaly run back in after. 

playing against her: The best way to beat a janna is to force her to waste mana. What does this mean? Pick someone with sustain (sona, alistar, taric, soraka, nunu) and actively try to win trades not in HP, but in terms of mana. A OOM janna is a janna that isn't scarry. So what can we do as a support?

Tell your ADC to be aggressive when you are, then be HYPER aggressive. actively trade your HP for their mana. Nunu is great for this. So is soraka. Alistar and taric are situational- they only work if you have an ADC that is good at follow up as both are melee. Taric has a smaller mana pool but decent regen with his passive. 

when janna W's you, you can expect a Q to follow up. The key here is to make sure you don't position yourself such that you and your AD get hit by the Q. if your able to eat a Q and your AD is free to do whatever he likes, then you win the trade.

the biggest problem is janna harass- it's so good. however, janna doesn't take harass super well. If your able to go aggressive on her, make her use her skills on herself then switch targets to the enemy AD, then your doing it right. 



Every little action as support bot lane has a purpose- i run towards the bush to force the enemy support backwards so they can't threaten my ADC. i run to river side and threaten to go aggressive on their ADC so they have to be careful or eat a chunk. I stand in front of my ADC in order to eat skillshots from ezreal, or harass from MF. i fake aggression in order to screw up my opponents rhythem. i use real aggression when i know we can't be ganked and we can win trades. i force their support to waste mana on me, instead of using it on my AD. 

every action as a support should have a defined purpose. If you have a good AD, he knows to follow up on this aggression and how to positon. If you have a bad AD, you can help relieve pressure. If your ADC fails at last hitting, then don't feel bad about taking farm that they would otherwise miss- your impact on teamfights will be much larger than theirs. Know where to ward and when. Know jungle routes, long routes, and when the opponent can lane-gank. keep an eye on the minimap for your teammates who might otherwise not know these things. 

it's infuriating to play support in solo queue at low elo. however, it's also much easier to dominate when your opponent doesn't know how to react properly, and ends up making lots of mistakes.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_wp9af,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/wp9af/for_those_who_want_to_get_better_at_support_here/,

How the role of AD carry works should be common knowledge, but clearly it isn't. AD carries hit who is closest to them, or who they can quickly finish off for a kill. This means that it could be an tank that gets the focus of the ADC, why? Because he is closest to the adc and is going to take way to much damage trying to hit somebody else. If you see your AD carry in the back 1v1ing the enemy Renekton go help them instead of trying to kill the enemy ADC. Even in Silver 1, where the play is somewhat solid, I still get teammates that don't understand how to work with an AD carry in teamfights. They all go yolo to try to kill the other ADC, while I'm back here getting eaten by a bruiser because nobody wants to peel for me.  

TL;DR- It's not your ADC's job to focus the other team's carry, ADC's hit whoever is closest to them so they can constantly do damage while still being safe. ",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1elfbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1elfbx/psa_about_how_the_ad_carry_role_works/,

*****

Hey guys! I have over a thousand ARAM games under my belt and have been meaning to write an ARAM guide for some time. With today's release of Howling Abyss I don't think there will be a better time than today. 

ARAM is a pretty simple game compared to Summoner's Rift. However, one of the major problems I see is that players itemize and play ARAM as if it was SR. All the guides for champions are based on SR, and people generally itemize according to these guides or the recommended items. In addition, the gameplay in ARAM is different yet people often play the same. In response to this observation I decided to write this small guide.

*****

**Sustain, sustain, sustain**

Probably the biggest difference between summoners rift and ARAM is that you cannot go back to the fountain to buy or heal. This has a major impact on the game. Here are some tips based on this difference.

*Trade efficiently*:

One of the biggest mistakes I see is high health champions diving in to get a kill on a low health champion. On SR this makes a lot of sense. If you can get a kill and survive, even if it costs you 90% of your health, you can go back and heal up. This isn't the case in ARAM. 

ARAM is best thought of as a battle of attrition. You should be aiming to whittle down your opponents health as much as possible. Since they can't regenerate at the fountain, waiting until your whole team is available to team fight against low health enemies is better than you diving in to kill a low health enemy and losing most of your health.

You should never dive or take turret shots unless it means cleaning up the last couple enemies so you can take their turret down faster. 

Remember, any low health enemy left on the map is as good as dead and will make the next team fight go in your favor. (there are some exceptions to this which I will talk about in the enemy team comp section) 

*Buy sustain items*

Mana regen and health regen are two of the most important items in ARAM. Since this is a battle of attrition, being able to earn back more health and mana than your opponent is key. If you are trading effectively and have good sustain than eventually you'll get to the point where they are all low health and you can team fight to take a turret. 

Chalice is a core item on many champs. You want to be able to spam your abilities. It's not like SR where you might use your abilities only to farm or harass, kill, and then go back to the fountain. You want to be able to spam most ranged abilities whenever they are off cool down. Additionally, the MR chalice gives you is great since bursty AP champs excel in ARAM. 

*****

**Itemization**

Itemizing in ARAM is a bit different than SR. Aura items are king, and yet I rarely see teammates getting anything but Bulwark. If you are a bruiser you should be aiming to get as many aura items as you can to help the team. I'm going to list the aura items in about the order of their importance.

* Legion/Bulwark: It goes without saying that every team should have one person carrying a bulwark. Unfortunately, this is often the only aura item I see a team getting. If you are a bruiser it's often best to rush this. 

* Locket: Rarely do I see people picking up this item, but I feel like it might be the best item in ARAM (perhaps even better than Legion). Giving your team a 200+ HP shield each is the equivalent of a Warmogs. Additionally, the base stats on the item are all extremely valuable for ARAM, especially if their team has some AD. The best thing about this is that multiple people on your team can have it. The reason no one gets this is that people simply look at champ guides or recommended items. 

* WOTA: Another excellent item I rarely see people getting because it's not in most SR guides or recommended items. It gives the equivalent to a Hextech Revolver to everyone on your team. The only reason this isn't higher is because sometimes your team comp will have a lot of AD, so you don't want to get it in every situation like Locket and Bulwark. If you are an AP you should be getting this after your first damage item. 

* Frozen Heart: Probably the best anti ADC item in the game, inside and outside of ARAM. If the enemy has more than one autoattack champion it's often best to rush this. If they just have one than you can usually wait until a bit later. 

* Abyssal: Another fantastic item. It's not a standard item on any champ like most of the above items, but just any AP champ that is generally in the middle of team fights. It especially works well with AP tanks like Rumble, Naut, and Rammus (Rammus should focus on Mpen and tankiness in ARAM). If the enemy has two or more mages it might be worth getting this faster for the MR. 

* Randuin's Omen: I count this is an aura item because of the activation's effect. However, *movement speed is not that important in ARAM*. Some games I will delay getting T2 boots until my 3rd item or later. There isn't a great distance to chase here, so the movement speed shred isn't as valuable as in SR. The shred is still go to help peel for your carries, but there are better options. I will get this if I am a tanky champ against a team with 2 or more AD.   

* Zeke's Herald: The purpose of this item is great, but it seriously needs a buff. The base stats are not great unless you need CDR. I'll get this if my team has *a lot* of AD, but even then it'll be my 4th or 5th item. 

*""Support""* champs:

Most guides and recommended items on support champs are based on them having little gold. This isn't the case in ARAM. Sona and Soraka are two of the best ARAM champs but I often, unfortunately, see people building them like supports. 

*Itemize based on the enemy*: This almost goes without saying. Often on ARAM you'll go up against an all AP or AD team. Build the appropriate resistance and you will win. 

*****

**Base your strategy around the enemies team comp**

Another big problem I see is people playing passively against poke comps or sustain teams. In both of these situations you should be going all-in every time. I've won several games against teams filled with Nidd, Yis and Luxes with mostly melee champs.

If the enemy team has a lot of sustain with someone like Nidd or Soraka, you can ignore the part about trading efficiently. You need to secure the kill otherwise they will regen back to full quickly. 

If the enemy has a lot of poke champs it's also important to go all-in most of the time. You have to think, ""if we wait to engage will our chances get better or worse?"". If they continue to poke down your health the best move is simply to all-in them. Even if you go 2 for 5 its better than going 0-10 while the enemy picks you off one by one behind turret. 

Another important thing is to communicate with your team. If you have a high value ult like Amu or Fidd tell them when it's off CD. Let them when you are going to engage. If they have a sustain comp, say ""we have to go all-in every time"". 

Finally, tanky teams snowball hard. Since you'll often be going against a lot of AP your tanks will start to be more and more valuable as the game goes on since they can't be bursted. I often see an AP team against a melee team get a huge lead and throw it away by diving to get kills and not trying to end it early. If you are most melee don't despair. Try to drag the game out and eventually you will roll them. Mundo is really good at this.

I made a reddit post about teaching and quickly received more than 100 students. ~ 20 of them are concurrent regulars.

I have given out over 50 games of personal 1 on 1 to up and coming AD players and here is hands down the most monolithic piece of advice I can give to you guys.

* DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE YOUR OPPONENT *

You're reading this like, oh well gee no duh. No. Read it again. And again. And again. And force yourself to adhere to it.

So now you say, okay well what does this do to improve my game? Here it is: The ADC position is the most mechanically involved other than top. There is no other role that takes into account the keyboard, muscle memory, instincts, rehearsal, and general gameplay knowledge like ADC. What up and comers need to do is practice dominant strategies and STICK to them.

You are playing against a bronze 2 and you're gold 3. You think: oh I can just walk into lane and shit on the guy. So what happens? You naturally start developing bad habits that stick to you. EVEN if you dominate, you will always setup bad habits if you go into a lane underestimating your opponent and dominating because of cheese. 

What should be the staple gameplay strategy is play against the enemy ADC as if he was a HIGHER elo than you. You never face check, you never push deep with mias, you never dive expecting them to be too slow on their barrier/flash, etc. ALL of these things will set you up for future failure and bad habits.

There are dominant strategies for ANY given situation where you might be potentially behind.  EX: Your support based, and the enemy bot is mia but not spotted by wards. You're unsure whether or not they based themselves or if they are roaming or getting red or anything. You DO know they are low level players. What is the dominant strategy? An amateur might suspect that because they are low levels it gives easy access to push. Wrong. you play passive until you can get vision on them or your support comes back. You do not ever sacrifice your positioning or safety even if you know the enemy bot lane might not be wise enough to anticipate your return.

You always play the dominant strategy. Never set yourself up for bad habits and failure. You always play smart regardless of the enemies level. This will get you places and sets you up for future AND immediate success rather than JUST immediate success. Trust me... having to relearn situations because of your previous bad habits is difficult and time consuming.

*The Nine Tailed Fox*

#*This is a guide on how to play Ahri in Mid Lane*

Ahri is an incredibly powerful snowballing mage that is capable of fighting 1v2s and coming out on top due to her high mobility from *Spirit Rush*. Her lvl 3 full combo will most definitely push any squishy enemy Mid Laner out of lane if not killing him/her. Upon hitting lvl 6, her ganking potential, kill potential, and even her survivability skyrocket for you're now have an access to technically Three Flashes thanks to her ult, which, once mastered, can allow for some absolutely amazing plays. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Abilities**

 * **Passive:** *Essence Theft* 

&gt; Ahri gains a charge of Essence Theft whenever one of her spells hits an enemy, (Max: 3 charges gained per spell). Upon gaining 9 charges, Ahri's Orb glows green, and she gains 35% Spell Vamp for the her next spell. (All charges are expended when she uses a spell at 9 charges).

Built in sustain for Ahri, a very nice thing considering that she is relatively squishy. The best way to utilize this passive to is have about 5 or 6 charges up and then attempt to engage the enemy, and, if he/she's smart, he/she will trade with you, by the end of the trade you should have 9 charges on your passive allowing you to either Q an entire minion wave as it approaches the lane in a straight line, or if that's not available, quickly using Q over the wall to hit your Wraith camp or the enemy's will suffice. Makes it hard for the enemy laner to push Ahri out of lane, during the early stages of the game, if you know how to utilize it effectively. Also, since W does more overall single target damage (plus 50% if additional fox-fires hit the same target), and since each fire-fox counts towards the entire 35% Spell Vamp, it may be better for you to use W than Q. 

 * **Q Ability:** *Orb of Deception* // Range: 880 // Cooldown: 7 / 7 / 7 / 7 / 7 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri sends her orb outward and then pulls it back, dealing Magic damage when going out and True damage on the way back. 

&gt; Costs: 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 33% Bonus AP)

&gt; True Damage:  40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 33% Bonus AP)

A very strong ability that is able to hit enemy champions who are hiding behind they're minion waves. The best way to maximize the amount of damage dealt by this ability, without the help from Charm, is to learn it's maximum range, being a skill shot, remember that it's range is gonna a bit longer than indicated (880 units), and use it at max range to get both of the Magic and True DMG procs off, without much room for your enemy to dodge either the Orb going out or coming back in. It also curves to the way you're moving, so if you'd like to reposition yourself to allow the True damage part to hit someone else, you can either ult in that direction, to get a more immediate repositioning, or just simply walk in that direction. 

 * **W Ability:** *Fox Fire* // Range: 800 // Cooldown: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri releases three fox fires that lock-on to nearby enemies, dealing Magic damage to them. (Prioritizes Champions). Enemies hit with multiple fox fires take an additional 50% increased damage per fox fire. 

&gt; Costs: 60 / 60 / 60 / 60 / 60 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 40% Bonus AP)

Use this ability to essentially duel with any melee that happens to get within range of your W as all 3 fox fires pack a big punch during early game. Remember that the 800 unit ranges overlap one another, for each fox fire. It's kinda hard, but learning the max range of each fox fire will actually help if you wish to just harass with one or two fox-fire(s), since the Mana cost on W is significantly cheaper than Q and E. 

 * **E Ability:** *Charm* // Range: 975 // 12 / 12 / 12 / 12 / 12 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri blows a kiss towards an enemy dealing Magic damage and charms him/her, making him/her walk helplessly towards Ahri.

&gt; Costs: 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 / 110 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 35% Bonus AP)

&gt; Charm Duration: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 second(s)

An amazing ability that can be a massive help when forcing objectives like Dragon, Baron, or Towers, as if can make an enemy squishy walk out of position in which you and the rest of your team engage on him/her. The best way to learn how to hit it is, just like Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab, or Thresh's Death Sentence, hit it at odd angles to surprise the enemy. Also, learn it's maximum range, being a skill shot, remember that it's range is gonna a bit longer than indicated (975 units), and use it at max range. 

**Tip:** Till Riot fixes this, since your Charm resets Buffs and neutral monsters, if you wish to stall more time for your team as the enemy team attempts to take Dragon, hit Dragon with your E and it'll reset it momentarily allowing it to regain 200-300 Health, effectively stalling. 

* **R Ultimate** *Spirit Rush* // Range: 450 // Cooldown: 110 / 95 / 80 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri dashes forth, firing 3 essence bolts, which deal damage to 3 nearby enemies. (Prioritizes Champions). Spirit Rush can be cast up to 3 times within 10 seconds before it goes on cooldown. 

&gt; Costs: 100 / 100 / 100 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 85 / 125 / 165 (+ 35% Bonus AP) (Single Essence Bolt)

&gt; Magic Damage: 255 / 375 / 495 (+ 35% Bonus AP x 3) (Total DMG From 3 Essence Bolts)

Ahri's most iconic ability, what some people call ""3 Free Flashes"" on a 48 second CD (Max Rank w/ 40% CDR), and for that reason alone, you should be surviving more sticky situations since this Ultimate is a saving grace I you happen to do something silly and get caught out of position. Use it for repositioning yourself if you're caught somewhere in the front line for some reason, use it to dodge important skillshots, i.e. Lux's Finales Funkein or Ezreal's Trueshot Barrage, use it to get to the enemy back line to melt the squishies, or use it to dance around the enemy team dealing AoE DMG with your Q + W + R. Remember that there is a 0.5 second lapse between each use of R. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Skill Order**

In almost all games you'll be maxing Q first, following with W, and then lastly E, while also putting points in R whenever possible.

**Starting Ability**

At most games in the very beginning, don't put any points into any abilities until you absolutely have to, that way you're prepared for whatever lays ahead, i.e. repelling invades, invading, surprise lvl 1 ganks, or just regular laning.

Start with Q if you're wishing to either:

 * Safely farm in lane without any chance of being harassed. (Be careful to not push the lane with your Q since it is an AoE)

 * Safely harass in lane without any chance of being harassed back. 

 * If you're invading, AND your team already has someone else leading with hard CC, and you wish to use a Q to hit everyone on the enemy team, if able and caught. 

Start with W if you're wishing to either:

 * If you're gonna be up-close-and-personal with your enemy laner early on and wish to trade well with him/her at Lvl 1 (Ideally champions who get his/her gap closer at Lvl 1, e.g. Fizz, Xin Zhao, etc.)

Start with E if you're wishing to either:

 * If you're the only person with hard CC on your team and you're team is invading the enemy jungle. 

 * If you know you're able to out harass an enemy laner with 1 E, if you can hit it, and multiple AAs
 
Remember that your Lvl 3 full combo does insane amounts of damage early on, if you can land everything, including all 3 Fire Foxes from your W. You are able to pull off incredible ""all-ins"" with Ahri due to her ultimate, once you hit Lvl 6, especially right underneath the enemy's tower. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Runes** 

My 2 personal set(s) specific to Ahri are:

**Set #1**
Name: MS w/ ManaReg, No Def.

&gt;3x Quintessences of Movement Speed

&gt;9x Marks of Magic Penetration

&gt;9x Seals of Mana Regeneration

&gt;9x Glyphs of Flat Ability Power

Reasoning: This set allows Ahri to dodge skillshots without being totally reliant on her Ultimate, in which I would save for later ganking other lanes, and as well as allowing me to sit in lane for a longer amount of time due to my Passive and ManaReg Seals, i.e. to farm, farm, and farm. Specifically this is for champions that directly counter me to the point that I can't do much but farm, e.g. champions like Morgana, due to Black Shield CC Null and Soul Shackle, Katarina due to Shunpo-ing away from skillshots, LeBlanc due to repositioning W spell w/ Silence DMG Nuke, etc.

**Set #2**
Name: MS w/ Def vs. AD/AP

&gt;3x Quintessences of Movement Speed / Quintessences of Flat Ability Power

&gt;9x Marks of Magic Penetration 

&gt;9x Seals of Flat Armour

&gt;9x Glyphs of Scaling Magic Resist

Reasoning: Obvious reason being to survive with Resistances against champions who can get up and personal against Ahri, i.e. Xin Zhao, Talon, etc., or are able to deal a large amount of burst damage in which your sustain can't match up to, i.e. Lux full combo, Katarina full combo, etc. Quintessences of Movement Speed can be replaced with Quintessences of Flat Ability Power if you prefer to have more DMG early on for counter-harass, I just prefer MS since Ahri's Base MS is ridiculously slow (305).
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Masteries**

&gt;21/0/9

Standard AP Mid masteries if you want to maximize your DMG potential, keep buffs longer, and bonus ManaReg to allow you to stay in lane longer, and as well as making your AAs hit harder due to the Spellsword mastery. 

&gt;9/21/0

Needed if you believe your Rune Page won't be enough to allow you to survive the early game and as well as if you believe you'll be ganked a lot pre-6. Added survivability is always nice, I'd recommend this set-up for anyone who is relatively new to Ahri. 

&gt;9/0/21

Only to be taken if having the additional 6% CDR early game and that fact that having a Lvl 6 Ult advantage will put you ahead against those champions that are not much without his/her ult, i.e. Kassadin, Akali, Nidalee, etc., I'd recommend this for experienced Ahri players, but is still worth a try if you're confident in your DMG potential, skill with skillshots and ganking potential. Is meant to be also taken if you're against enemy laners that tend to roam a lot, i.e. Twisted Fate, Evelynn, Nidalee, etc. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Builds**

**Important Reminder:** These builds are to NOT be followed religiously! Build accordingly, which means to what is best for your team. E.g. 
Your team mainly Magic DMG? Build an Abyssal Scepter. Your teams wants your sole job to be to kill the enemy ADC with one burst combo? Get a Deathfire's Grasp. Loosing your lane? Remember that defensive stats always beat out offensive stats. 

**Core Items:**
 
 * *Sorcerer Shoes* [](/sorcerersshoes) - More Magic Penetration is always nice, i.e. we're attempting to maximize our burst damage potential here. Also, feel free to get an upgrade in either Alacrity, for bonus MS, or Homeguard for getting back to Mid Lane much quicker.

 * *Morellonomicon* [](/morellonomicon) - I know what you may be thinking, ""why, INA Aurelius?!"" I'll tell you why, this item has to be the single most cost efficient item, for the stats that it gives, in the game! Ahri is a type of champion who doesn't need excessively heavy AP items to deal ""Tons of Damage,"" but that doesn't mean she doesn't need them. It's an amazing first item to complete due to it's absurd cheapness, meaning that you may have a definite item advantage on your enemy laner, e.g. you have one completed ""big ticket item"" vs the enemy laner's one Needlessly Large Rod. It most cases, if you haven't died at all, you'll have it completed during the middle of Laning Phase, which is a massive advantage. It's stats can be equivalent to that of a Blue Buff, plus the 20% CDR from it, is massive! Ahri, as an Assassin, benefits greatly from it! Also, the passive allows your Bot Lane ganks to go much more smooth if the enemy Bot Laner's happen to have some sort of emergency heal spell. Honestly, I can only say so much about how great I find this item for Ahri, but it all boils down to the fact that you'd have to try it out yourself. 

 * *Rabadon's Deathcap* [](/rabadonsdeathcap) - A very very solid item for Ahri. More AP for more burst, I'd recommend this as either a 2nd or 3rd item. Adds to her overall amount of DMG DPS AoE potential in comparison to DFG.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
**Why DFG Is Rushed Rather Than Deathcap, Single Target DMG-wise**

Assuming:

&gt;Glass cannon runepage

&gt;21-0-9 masteries 

&gt;Level 7, R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E

&gt;Base AP = [(4.95 * 3) + (0.17 * 9 * 7) + 6 + 7] * 1.05 = 40

&gt;Target has 50 MR

&gt;You land all skillshots

&gt;One full rotation only

&gt;Sorc shoes are accounted for in all calculations


 * Why level 7? Because that's roughly when you should be finishing your first big item. Of course, it's possible to finish it much earlier, but I've chosen to consider an ""average"" case.

 * Why 50 MR? It's a simple, round number that makes calculations easy and accounts for MR gained from runes and/or masteries.

DFG:

&gt;Total Cost: 4200

&gt;Total AP: (39 + 120) * 1.05 = 167

&gt;Orb of Deception = 115 + (0.33 * 167) = 170 magic damage + 170 true damage

&gt;Fox-Fire = 80 * (0.8 * 167) = 214 magic damage

&gt;Charm = 60 + (0.35 * 167) = 118 magic damage

&gt;Spirit Rush = 255 + (1.05 * 167) = 430 magic damage

&gt;Total Damage Before MR Mitigation = [(170 + 214 + 118 + 430) * 1.2] + 170 = 1118 magic damage + 170 true damage + 15% of target's current health

&gt;Total MR = 50 * 0.92 - 7.8 - 15 = 23.2

 * Total Damage After MR Mitigation = 0.81 * (1118 + 15% of target's current health) + 170 = 907 magic damage + 170 true damage + 12% of target's current health

Deathcap: 

&gt;Total Cost: 4400

&gt;Total AP: (39 + 120) * 1.35 = 215

&gt;Orb of Deception = 115 + (0.33 * 215) = 186 magic damage + 186 true damage

&gt;Fox-Fire = 80 * (0.8 * 215) = 252 magic damage

&gt;Charm = 60 + (0.35 * 215) = 135 magic damage

&gt;Spirit Rush = 255 + (1.05 * 215) = 481 magic damage

&gt;Total Damage Before MR Mitigation = (186 + 252 + 135 + 481) + 186 = 1054 magic damage + 186 true damage

&gt;Total MR = 50 * 0.92 - 7.8 - 15 = 23.2

 * Total Damage After MR Mitigation = 0.81 * 1054 = 856 magic damage + 186 true damage

As you can see, DFG provides much more damage than Deathcap early for roughly the same amount of gold, which is why we rush DFG first if you build as an assassin. Naturally, the results vary when you start to factor in CDR and other items, but even then, DFG is powerful all around. For other builds, Deathcap deals consistently more damage than when DFG's active is down (not counting CDR).
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Early Game**

 1. Do the usual as you've seen it a thousand times and done it a thousand times before. Don't put in any points in any abilities right off the bat, not until you know what you and your team are doing, e.g. point in E if invading, Q if normal. 
 
 2. Use 1 of your wards to ward the enemy Wraith camp. (Why? So you can keep up with where the enemy Jungler is, cause that ward can give so much information to the rest of the team, but thta's for another guide.)

 3. Help your jungler do Blue/Red Buff through either a Q or some AAs

 4. While that goes on you and your Top Lane do Wolves or Wraiths, so that you have an experience advantage when you get into lane. 

 5. Afterwards, go to lane and start farming for your Core Items. 

**Important Reminder:** During the most early parts of the game, you must be fairly cautious, for, when playing as Ahri, it's extremely hard to make a comeback if you fall behind, i.e. if you die more than 3x before Laning Phase is over, so be careful when trading or going ""all-in"" if you have any hint that you may die during the process.

**Playstyle**

As Ahri, you're welcome to play in whatever playstyle you wish, for she can fit well in either a passive playstyle, farming and disengaging with E, or an aggressive play-style, harassing with Qs + Ws. 

 * My personal playstyle with her involves a mixture of both, that being specifically me just farming with AAs and sometimes abilities for last hitting, I never harass, and then only going in for a full combo when I see an available opportunity, e.g. enemy laner goes to ward brush, I stop farming and get in the best position to hit the enemy with my E and proceed with a full combo. 

 * If you find an opportunity to gank, do so, IF your lane is pushed AND you just forced your enemy laner back. You don't necessarily have to have your ultimate up to gank other lanes, Ahri performs ganks well with just her normal kit, relying on hitting a Charm is crucial though. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________

### **Mid Game**

The time of Mid Game is generally characterized by the idea that one or two towers are down, a play has been made for a Dragon, and that champions are no longer staying in his/her respective lane to farm, but are instead grouping up for larger teamfights. 

During this time is when Ahri shines for this is when enemy champions are just beginning to consider building MR, due to the fact that Ahri's damage potential peaks at this phase You'll want to have at least 2 big ticket items completed, if not, try to prolong teamfights, and go farm for it. (Your kit allows you to be very slippery so solo farming w/o vision isn't too bad, but map awareness should still be taken into account of.) 

**Charm's Importance**

Ahri's kit is perfect for forcing teamfights, thanks to her Charm, learn to master it! Hit it at odd angles on enemy squishies to force them into an awkward position, that your team can take advantage of, although be careful to not overextend yourself for you can be insta-gibbed really quickly. 

Your burst at this time is tremendous, so if you find an opportunity to ""catch"" an enemy out of position and at least get him/her really low, so that you can force a 5v4, if not actually get the kill, do so! Take advantage of the various mistakes that your enemies will make! 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Late Game**

This is a pretty difficult part of playing Ahri since she tends to fall off around 35-40 minutes, i.e. her damage is simply not as amazing as it used to be as enemy champions pick up more HP items and resistances, so from that it'd be ideal to try to end the game before she starts falling off. 

But if it so happens that the game lasts longer than 35-40 minutes, your role in teamfights is still to insta-gibb the ADCs and other squishies, but more importantly you can serve the sole purpose of forcing champions into bad positions with Charm. At this time, your ult may no longer do much damage overall, so you may just save it just for repositioning yourself if you get caught in bad positions during teamfights. You can clean up fights really well during late game, so learn to stay in the back and just spam Q's, until the right opportunity arrives. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### Tips &amp; Tricks

 * If you need the True damage part of your Orb of Deception to hit much sooner, you can ult closer, and sometimes into, to your opponent to have the Orb return to you sooner. 

 * Aggravate your enemies by Charming neutral camps and reseting them, potentially stalling for your team. 

 * When in a 1v1 vs. another champion with skillshots, e.g. Lux, Ezreal, and you have good timing, you can maximize your juking potential of his/her's skillshots but Ulting through them so that you're behind them, also sets you up for your full combo.

 * Try to space out your 3 uses of Spirit Rush, in case other opportunities arise, or you realize what you were doing was a bad idea and need to get out. 

 * Your Ult's dash range is a little shorter than an actual Flash so be wary when trying to Ult through thicker walls like those in Mid Lane. 

 * Learn Ahri's Damage Potential with items and without, so that you're knowledgeable of every situation that arises 

 * During early game, try to not Q all the minions if you're trying to harass your lane opponent for it'll push your lane

 * I'd recommend last hitting with only your AAs and E Charm so that you don't push the lane.

 * Learn to hit AAs in between your 3 Ults as it will maximize your DMG especially during the early stages of the game when you just hit Lvl 6.

GG nubs"", or a guide to beating the ""OP champs"".",abchiptop,124,26,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1g07xn/to_my_fellow_bronze_players_wtf_you_didnt_ban/,"I've been playing league for a little over a year. Due to an improbably large amount of AFKs in placement matches, I found myself in bronze after being S2 Silver, and am slowly climbing up from bronze v.

I all too often see a team give up mentally when the enemy team gets Amumu, Malphite, Shen or Blitzcrank. I've played a decent amount of each of these except Malph, and I can tell you they're not worth throwing a game over! 

Shen. The ultimate split pusher. He can build almost nothing but health and defenses, yet still maintain a presence all game. Run teleport and he's back and forth across the map before you know what happened. He can be in the middle of nowhere, then ult in, shielding an ally and changing a 4v4 into a 4v5. So how do you deal?

% health is a fantastic counter. He's gonna build a lot of it, so use that to your advantage. Work on catching enemies out of place. Bait a runner into a 2v1, hope he notices and ults, and bust through the shield. If you kill them before he teleports, his ult goes on cooldown. Alternatively, if you know you can't burst that quickly, disengage. Turn around and run. You will piss him off by wasting his ult, then it's down for a while on CD. Sure you didn't get the kill, but his presence is lessened now, and he has to waste time getting back to lane or burn teleport.

He's tanky, no doubt about it, but he isn't great for damage. He may thornmail for when he taunts. At the point, MR will reduce damage greatly. Buy some.

Amumu, the jungle mummy. He can bandage toss in, cry tears of pain and ult stun an entire team, all while being tanky. OR, he will go AP, burst like hell, and melt in an instant.

The problem with Amumu is bronze is that nobody knows how to use him, because he's always banned. I remember in S2, he was often considered a troll pick in low ELO, which lead me to look into why. The biggest reason? People didn't look at how to build *or* play him. You want to go AP tank. You want an hourglass, a bulwark and a Deathcap and merc treads. You'll be fairly tanky, but loaded with burst. A little secret: he's great for a surprise offensive flash into ult, then Q as they run away so you have a chase tool. Save that bandage.

So how do you play against him? Banshee's Veil. Single handedly the best item to counter him, followed by QSS to cleanse that ult. MR will shut him down, even with his passive. See, Amumu has one major weakness (outside of his mana consumption), and that is that he can be kited indefinitely if you can dodge his bandage toss. He has no gap closer, no ranged poke. He can pull himself into your team and ult, that's about it. So when you see that coming, get your own stun ready, and stun his ass before he lands, some folks will escape the ult if you react in time. A banshee will pop and no stun for you if he does ult. Work on juking and Amumu is no threat. Coming from the bushes you say? Buy a damn ward.

Blitzcrank. Fucking Beep Boop. Often banned because I don't want my support playing him, not because I'm scared of him. You dodge the grabs and you bait the shield. Never chase a blitz, they can run like hell and lead you to a trap. Can't dodge? Buy a banshee again. It'll block that spell. That grab has a fairly long cooldown, and it's hard for us low ELO players to hit. Keep vision on him and watch the animation, when his arm raises, move behind a minion or to the side. If you lose sight, you get grabbed (happened to me over a wall today).

Malphite is my least experience, but I can offer a little advice: don't clump up in team fights. He can dive like a boss, and does decent damage with CC while his team follows. My biggest recommendation? If these champs aren't banned, first pick usually grabs them. Play Anivia, Trundle or J4. What you want to do is get a champ that can separate Malph from his team. You see him ult in? Hello Anivia wall. He is now stranded for roughly 3 seconds after CC wears off while you nuke him, unless the enemy team burned flash. Trundle can drop a pillar, and J4 can either sacrifice ult onto the enemy team or right where you stand to lock them out and pummel Malph. Warn your team if you try that last one. 

The best part about your enemy team getting these: unless they play a lot of blind pick, they're likely inexperienced with them. They picked them because ""omg OP"", but they more likely than not don't know how to play them. These techniques helped me beat a team with each of these aside from Amumu today on my climb out of bronze V to IV. 

The most important thing is to get game knowledge. Play these champs in a custom game, see what works and what doesn't. With a little practice, you can counter the OP champs and beat an over confident team that thinks Shen = win.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1g07xn,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1g07xn/to_my_fellow_bronze_players_wtf_you_didnt_ban/,
1371464694.0,95,self.summonerschool,1giaw1,A few months ago I posted about a 6-month climb to diamond. Here's my progress and what I've learned,Rawnix,113,18,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1giaw1/a_few_months_ago_i_posted_about_a_6month_climb_to/,"So about 2 months ago I posted a thread on reddit about a 6-month climb to diamond. I started at Bronze III, here's where I am now:

http://imgur.com/hrQ2fSD

I'm making this thread to explain some things I've learned along the way:

1) Be aggressive-

Early game aggression is amazing when you know how to play it right. I dont mean level 1 dive aggressive, but early pushing and drawing jungle aggro to yourself is valuable to your team. If everywhere is pressured hard, the enemy jungler will be hard-pressed to relieve the pressure. Likewise, your jungler will be free to counterjungle and countergank.

2) Dying's almost never ""worth""

This is probably the most important one. Dying for a drake is definitely worth it, but trading kills in lane is never worth it (except for First Blood). Late-game deaths matter a lot more, so dying late game is typically not worth it. You'll have to make that decision based on how well your team is doing and how much of an impact your death will have. 

3) Insta-mute anyone who you even think is going to flame.

Simple, just use the mute button. Also, turn off All-Chat. Nothing good can ever come out of all-chat.

4) You have to be a leader

Insert yourself as a dominant presence in the game. Communicate, be positive, take charge. As a top laner something that rarely failed me was to kill my lane, gank mid, then call for drake. Running teleport really helped with this because I could just TP right back to top lane when drake was done (or B, as I'd usually have at least 1k after that)

5) Dont blindly follow builds

When you look up a guide, you need to know why that build works. Why do people build Blue Ezreal? When there are multiple builds for a champion, which will benefit your team most? This will take some deep understanding of the game to master, but learning how to build to your current situation will drastically improve your game.

6) Dont blindly follow counterpicks

This goes back to 5. Why does Mordekaiser counter Diana? Why would Renekton be good against Jax? Why would you pick Fiddle vs Vlad? Knowing the reason behind the counterpick is far more important than playing a champion you arent comfortable with. For example: I know that Fizz counters Lux. However I don't play Fizz. But why does Fizz counter Lux? Simple, because he has some of the best all-in for a mid laner. So instead of playing Fizz, who I'm not all that great with, I play Katarina. Kat can all-in almost as well as Fizz can and I'm comfortable with her.

7) Timerstimerstimers

Time blue. Time red. Time drake. Time golems. TIME EVERYTHING. This allows for you to set up sneaky drakes, steals, or counterplay. If you know that they did drake at 20:16, then you know they'll try again some time around 26:16. You can be sure to have wards and your team in the area so you can intercept their drake attempt.

8) Stop raging

I still havent mastered this one, but the less I rage the more I win. Raging is time consuming and clouds your judgement.

9) The game isnt over until the nexus explodes.

I actually press yes in about 1/20 surrenders. A game is always winnable, you never know when half the enemy team could randomly DC (no srsly, I had it happen a few games back O_o). Stop giving up hope, and encourage your teammates when morale is low. Dont surrender unless it's plain and clear you're wasting time.

10) You aren't the center of the universe

I used to get mad when I lost lane. I'd blame my Jungler ""XIN YOU HAVENT GANKED ENOUGH"". Then I'd realize he was 10-1-4 at 15 minutes and still get angry, ""if he's so good why didnt top get ganks?"" etc etc. Don't be that guy. If you lose lane, that is purely 100% YOUR fault. No matter what happened. Its YOUR FAULT if you lose lane. If you lose lane but everyone else is doing good, do your part to help them carry your sorry ass. You aren't the center of attention, and you wont always win lane. Get comfortable with coming from behind, because you will be doing a lot of it when up against people of equal skill level.

11) You shouldn't be Diamond I. You'd be there already otherwise.

The skill gap from Bronze III to Silver IV is so huge I cant begin to describe it. It's massive. Don't overcredit yourself, thinking you should be at least Plat by now. ""Oh but I have plat friends that say I'm good"". Point is: If you're Bronze, you're likely gonna stay bronze until you improve something about the way you play.

12) Set realistic CS Goals

150 by 20 minutes. Any lane. Above that and you're doing great.

13) Communicate !@#%@#%@#$!~#%!

Seriously, tell your team in champ select what you're planning that game. Describe it in detail, and request bans based around that strat. If you want an all-in comp, banning Janna is always a good idea. If you want a poke comp, ban heavy initiators like Malphite, Hecarim, and Amumu. Splitpush comp? Remove TF and Shen if you arent playing them. Stuff like this will help your team a dramatic amount.

14) Be adaptable

This has a double meaning. The first meaning is that you should be able to play any role. By play, I mean carry with any role. I currently have at least 2 champions I can play in any role that I'm plenty comfortable with. 

The second meaning is that you should be able to form your strategies around your current situation. This involves counterbuilding and changing up your ideas. Example: You went for a ""Protect the Kog"" comp, but your ADC is just too far behind to actually deal damage. Instead, protect your APC or dive onto their ADC. 

15) Dont mindlessly queue

Zombie mode = no no. If you're not giving the game your full attention, dont play ranked.

16) Test your ping

I do this with a quick warmup game of Dominion before I play any normals or ranked. Sometimes my ping gets pretty high, so this lets me know before I ruin anyone's day.

1375564719.0,96,self.summonerschool,1jn96r,Kassadin Bot after min 34. Genius or n00b?! An analysis of a recent tsm play.,Acedin,129,33,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jn96r/kassadin_bot_after_min_34_genius_or_n00b_an/,"**The Situation:**

* It's after min 30, DIG and TSM are pretty close to each other. Both have kinda fed carries.
* Regi's Kassadin shows up at Bottom, clearing Minions -&gt; the caster calls it out as an obvious mistake.
* DIG starts Baron, Kassadin is on his way up. Bot is a huge wave pushing now.
* Suddenly Wildturtles Graves gets caught badly. TSM gets anhilated.
* Regi Blamed.

**My Analysis**
Okey, I'm neither a TSM nor a Regifanboy. However, TSM's plan was genius. AFAIK their plan was:

* Creating a huge wave bottom -&gt; map pressure/towers threw minions
* baiting DIG into doing baron.
* carefully getting some damage off by contesting with 4.
* Kassadin arrives late, but that does not matter as DIG has mr-debuffs from baron on them. also he'd be able to freely flank their carries as he came threw river and his team backed off to their blue.
* Kassadin is a mobile Assasin who gets more damge per jump. There fore him traveling far and entering a fight late would allow him to burst atleast 1 of DIG instantly.
* If DIG collapsed onto the 4 they'd have taken Baron damage can couldve gotten kited.
* If DIG stayed on baron they'd have lost bot and would most likely have been aced out.
* if the 4 man wouldve not been able to put pressure on DIG. TSM couldve just backed out and gotten bottom threw minions while pressuring a baron-damaged DIG that wants to TP B.

Problem was that the Turtle did a misplay. I guess he wanted to Quickdraw over a wall and got stuck. The most iportant member of TSM fucking up in such a situation hurts. Espacially when they had such a great gameplan.

IMO it was a genius plan. It had mid risk, and mid to high reward. Well unless someone like an AD does a terrible misplay. Shit happens. I still think we can learn from that^^

1373410762.0,93,self.summonerschool,1hyv64,"Aggressive split pushing, and why you should do it more",blanketninja,109,16,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1hyv64/aggressive_split_pushing_and_why_you_should_do_it/,"Split pushing as a strategy is something that is so strong in League than I almost always end up doing it in about 95% percent of games I play. Seeing as I was a HUGE Shen and Singed player, split pushing became a large part of my playstyle that transferred over when I switched to ADC, and has obvious influences even when I occasionally play middle and jungle.

**Why is splitting to take objectives so important?**

* In League, objectives (structures) are everything. Taking objectives gives you more control, and losing objectives forfeits control to the enemy team. With more control, comes more potential opportunities to make plays and put high amounts of pressure on the enemy team.

* Towers give you control over that area of the map; a downed tower means no protection or vision on that area of the map anymore. You could be perfectly even with the enemy team in terms of gold, but if they have all your outer turrets down, and they still have theirs up, it is extremely difficult to play from that situation since they have a lot more control of the map and space to work with.

* A downed inhib loses **SO MUCH CONTROL** for whatever team loses it. Not only do super minions now naturally push that lane super hard, all other lanes will start to naturally push without any outside help either. A downed inhibitor will give you passive control in every single lane without having to do anything, allowing your team to group and force things like Baron / Dragon / Pushes. The enemy is now under high pressure from every single point in the map, and if they mess up, will simply be pushed in from all sides.

* Most people subconsciously understand the impact of losing many towers and an inhib, so they will put an extraordinary amount of effort into stopping split pushes. Everyone knows how annoying it is to stop the split pushing Teemo / Singed / Shen / Tryndamere, and what happens if you don't stop them from taking down your inhib.

So the tl;dr is that structures offer your team a huge amount of control, and it is in your best interest to defend them as much as possible. On the flipside, it is extremely advantageous to take down as many structures as possible on the enemy team so you can afford your team more control of the map, giving you more space to make plays and win the game.

**So why is split pushing as a strategy so effective in taking down structures and objectives?**

* Split pushing at it's core is extremely effective because it requires minmum coordination to set up, and takes *much more* coordination in able to stop it. What this means is that you constantly spread the enemy team apart, forcing them to commit more resources to stop your push, then you invested into splitting that lane. If they're constantly trying to stop your pushes, it prevents them from grouping up and making plays by forcing teamfights or Barons or pushing down a lane.

* If they slip up and make the mistake of grouping up and not stopping your push, you gain a huge amount of control by pushing down the inhib in that lane.

* You as a single person can create a HUGE amount of pressure on the map not just by split pushing, but by being super super aggressive with it. Force them to constantly be defending that lane, and try to just 1v1 whoever ends up trying to stop you and see if you can kill them and force another person back. The second they need to send two people to stop your push is basically when you've already won the game.

* Split pushing the entire game allows you to gain levels and farm like no one else in the game. It'll put you at a HUGE item and level advantage, which makes you grow stronger at a rate much faster than anyone else on the enemy team. You'll soon be able to take towers faster, have the potential to solo people, and just in general be able to put even more pressure on the map as the game goes on.

* Putting enemy teams under constant pressure **(ESPECIALLY IN SOLOQ / NORMAL GAMES)** means that they will constantly be making mistakes you can capitalize on. If they decide to send the wrong person back to stop you, you have the potential to kill them and take even more turrets. If half the team wants to defend your push and the other half wants to push, the enemy team is completely split and your team has a chance to engage on them. As you split push more and more and become more experienced, you begin to recognize mistakes and begin to capitalize on them  to make your split push even more effective.

---

And one last point; I find split pushing to be extremely extremely fun. I know what you're thinking: how can it be fun to just sit in a lane and push it all day?

My answer to that is two-fold. One: I LOVE farming. Split pushing will guarantee you always end up with the most farm in the game. Once you actually join teamfights, you have such a big item and level advantage over everyone that you just dominate everyone. Coming into a teamfight as a 300cs Singed is among one of my favourite things to do.

The second answer is that I love to watch the enemy team fold and crumble as they try to deal with a split push. There's few things more satisfying than having people chase you around while your team takes towers and dragons and Barons. You can almost smell the desperation from the enemy team when multiple people chase you for over an entire minute. Especially in soloq, you know that everyone on the enemy team is most likely raging and all forms of communication have probably broken down by this point. I get a huge amount of pleasure over watching them just throw games because they get desperate.

--

tl;dr split pushing is fun, extremely effective, and is way way easier to do then it is to defend against, so you should be doing it more and getting your free wins.

Any comments, questions, discussions, etc would be appreciated as I always love to hear from other people about their perspective on split pushing.

If you're interested in the blog post where I ramble about split pushing for way longer than I do here (I cut out a lot, lol), you can check that out here: 

* http://isuckatleague.tumblr.com/tagged/theory

And as always, it's sometimes more useful to see video footage of all of this being put into practice, so here's a soloq game I had on my smurf where I was playing support nidalee (don't kill me pls). Based on team comps and how the game was going, we had zero chance of actually winning any 5v5s, so I just resorted to split pushing the entire game.

We actually end up winning a game we had no business of winning just through some careful, calculated split pushing, and the enemy team cracking under the pressure.

A **lot** in the 1000-1400 ELO range. Now, let's be honest, these aren't the highest of ratings, but given that 1300 ELO is approximately the top 20% of all players (given population), more people than we likely want to admit fall in this range. But this is something we as Summoner School **need** to talk about.  

For the past few weeks, my games have been plagued by the following situation:

* Laner (typically Top, but anyone can be guilty of this) gets a moderate lead in lane; maybe they go 3/1/2 or something to that point where they're not snowballing, but comfortable enough in lane.

* Laner takes their tower

* Laner leaves lane and goes roaming, netting several kills along the way

So far, so good, right? Well here's the problem. When you drop the enemy's first tower, your obligation to your lane has not ended. For the most part, you've given a free-farming lane to your enemy to let them catch up, and your pressure that you exert in other lanes must be so dramatic as to pull them away from that lane. 

By allowing your previously beaten lane-opponent to farm while you are ""making plays"" across the map, with every creep wave your tower gets whittled down. Over time (or sometimes immediately) your tower is down so you are now 1:1 with towers breaking even, and your enemy has farmed without harassment for an extended period of time. 

What I'm going to say here may be a shock to some, although I know the cooler heads of Summoner School will prevail. 

**You lost your lane.**

You did not need, nor ask for external help, you abandoned your lane to die. Flat out, no arguing against it. Maybe mid was really getting camped hard and you were needed there? That's great that you have the freedom with a tower down to roam down there, but get there, do what you need to do, and get out before you force the game into the teamfight phase.

By not keeping your lane specifically pushed up, you restrict vision of the map. In addition, you force someone else to do it, and this often forces 4v5's in the lane phase. You may think ""well leave it and team fight"" but how about no one engages, we save the tower, *and then* team fight at full strength, knowing that time is on our side and it's just a matter of time before the minions in that wave force the enemy to deal with them. 

So, you may be asking, what can be done to help yourself? Make it a game to see how long you can go without losing the tower. Don't sit under it with a 4-man gank sitting a bush ready to dive on you, but if they send 4 players up to just deal with you, that's worth your team being able to have 3-4 in another lane and pushing it, forcing at least an even trade (often they can push a lane with a tower already down, netting you free access to an inhibitor tower).

Think of your minions as your advance party, scouting for you so long as they are alive. You like vision of the map, right? Wards alone don't accomplish this, minions provide significant vision that the average person doesn't appear to appreciate, and by not keeping waves pushed up it can be downright impossible for anyone to go out warding. You may say ""WARD FFS"" but at the same time, the warding players are in a position where to do so is borderline suicidal, as if minions were at least pushed to the river they can maneuver based around sightings of the enemy and successfully ward.

This is getting lengthy, and wordy, but I think we need to address that the lane phase doesn't end just because one player thinks it did and he wants to go roam into lanes. You can lose your lane 30 minutes into a game easily just by not being there for 10, and while lane clearing can be a shared responsibility in the team fight phase, everyone should be aware of the drastic benefits keeping your lane farmed up and free of enemy minions confers.

* When creating plants, it's possible (and I would say optimal) to cast Deadly Bloom (Q) or Grasping Roots (E) first, and use Rampant Growth (W) once or twice during the cast animation. E -&gt; W is much harder to dodge than W -&gt; E.  

* Rampant Growth has much longer cast range (825) than wards (600).  
	* When enemies are missing, checking a bush with Rampant Growth before warding it could save your life. Use W and take a step back. If there are enemies in the bush, keep running. If it's empty, you're probably safe to ward it.  
	* Rampant Growth can reach into spots over walls that wards can't; most notably [the purple side bot tribush](http://i.imgur.com/DgvEFat.jpg), [the dragon camper's bush](http://i.imgur.com/At48nLH.jpg), and [the red bush without revealing yourself](http://i.imgur.com/uEia2z7.jpg).  

* Zyra's plants can block enemy skillshots.  
	* When recalling at low health, place a plant next to yourself to [stay safe from Nidalee spears](http://i.imgur.com/i79AlYh.jpg) and such.  
	* Placing a plant between yourself and an unwarded bush can let you ward it or walk past it without getting Death Sentenced by the enemy Thresh.  

* Attacks from Zyra's plants pop spell shields.  
	* During a siege, a quick Q+W in the sidelines can pop enemy Banshee's Veils and keep them on cooldown.  
	* When laning against Sivir, make sure the benefits from creating plants near her outweigh the potential free mana she can get from them. Either take advantage of the spellshield cooldown or keep your plants in your pants.  

* Creating a plant on top of a Teemo mushroom or Nidalee trap will spring the trap. This does reveal the plant and a small area around it to the enemy team, however.  

* The Shard of True Ice active can be used on Zyra's [plants](http://i.imgur.com/cXN46Br.png) and [seeds](http://i.imgur.com/2s0GmHM.png). Growing the seed into a plant cancels the effect.

Also, because I don't feel like waiting for a better time to post these:  
**Bonus support tip #1:** When playing against Leona, Exhausting her marksman also reduces the damage from Leona's passive, as it counts as the other player's damage.  
**Bonus support tip #2:** When playing against Lulu, having two points in the mastery ""Unyielding"" (defense, tier 3) causes her passive to deal 0 damage to you until she's level 3. Pix's bolts deal 3 damage each at levels 1 and 2, which gets reduced to 2 damage by your base magic resist, and then to 0 damage by the mastery. At level 3, the bolts' base damage increases to 7 and you'll take some damage from them, but the mastery will keep reducing the total damage you're taking by 6 (plus 2 from the autoattack).",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1375905732.0,,,True,t3_1jwi5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jwi5e/a_handful_of_zyra_tips/,

A lot of times I will see my friends complain about an OP champion in a game (Blitzcrank, Zed, Amumu, etc). They don't do anything to fix this though. So here is some quick advice. If you are constantly struggling against a champion, then pick up the champion on a free week, or buy them and play them for a bit. This will do several things.  

You will learn their cooldowns. For example, at my ELO blitzcrank is permabanned because of his hook. However this hook has a base cooldown of 20 seconds. That is 20 seconds of pure unadulterated harass you can get off on him if he misses it. People will still be wary of him if he misses a grab though  

You will learn what exactly their abilities do. Sometimes it's obvious (like blitz's hook), but other times it is less noticeable. For example, Fizz's ultimate has several factors to it. To start, it is not a targeted ability, but a skill shot. Having not played fizz before, you may not realize that it can be dodged/juked. If it doesn't hit a champion it stays on the ground AND attaches to the first champion that passes over it. This takes an ability that seemingly has little counterplay and turns it into something you can work with.

Finally, you learn when a champion is dangerous. Zed is dangerous at level 6. Before that he is actually fairly vulnerable. Kha'zix and rengar on the other hand will mess your day all up at level 2.

1368620314.0,96,self.summonerschool,1edmme,Tips for having an impact on the game as support,LMeadows93,109,13,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1edmme/tips_for_having_an_impact_on_the_game_as_support/,"Hello, I've seen a lot of threads recently on /r/summonerschool about how to have an impact or 'carry' the game as support. A common misconception of solo queue is that you have to pick the high DPS champions to carry a game, by getting a lot of gold and killing lots of opponents. While damage is relatively important to winning a game, there are more important aspects, such as decision making and pressure on the map. All positions can do this, but support can have a massive impact on the pressure and dynamics of a game.

In this post, I'm going to avoid topics like 'how to win your lane' because that is an obsession that many people seem to have when it comes to gaining elo. I'm more interested in the 'win lane, lose game' aspect, and more importantly, why did you lose after winning your lane?

* **Pressure**
Pressure in LoL comes in many different ways. For support, the fundamentals of gaining pressure for your team is vision and decision making. Vision is knowledge, and knowledge allows you to make decisions based on the enemies position. For example, If you have a ward on enemy blue, and you see two champions taking that buff down, you know a 4 man push at top is going to generate a lot of pressure on the enemy team, forcing them to be co-ordinated and either stop your push as a team, or quickly counter-push to trade objectives for whatever you take from them. Forcing solo queue teams to make split second decisions is how mistakes are made, at any level of play.

* **Decision making**
Based on vision, this allows the support to make crucial decisions on what the team's next objective should be. If you just got a kill at bot lane, and you see that the enemy jungler is ganking top lane, then quickly take a free dragon, there is no way they can contest as you outnumber them and have the jungler's smite present. A good support can read the dynamics of the game and understands what objective can be taken next.

* **Objectives**
The most important topic in a game of LoL. Objectives win games. And it is the supports job to recognise which objectives can be taken next. Objectives can be listed into a list of importance with inhibitors and baron being situational, then towers, dragon, neutral buffs. Why do I consider an inhibitor and baron to be equal? Because they go hand-in-hand with the pressure they give on the next 5 minutes of the game. If you take an inhibitor is causes all lanes to push which can allow for further snowballing, taking more towers, buffs, dragons etc. If you take baron, the buff it brings also allows you to snowball and take more objectives. Which one to take first is entirely on decision making and reading the dynamics of the game. One thing to note is that it is important your team ALL do ONE objective together, rather than 2 going to take an inhibitor and 3 going to take baron. It is better to follow your team EVEN if you don't agree with the objective they are choosing to take.

Overall, as a support it is your job to be a leader, and read the game. Be a general, a master tactician who can read the dynamics of the game to realise what objective is best to take next. Champions are simply pawns to help you take objectives, which means that you shouldn't chase down a pawn when you can take a king.

I hope these topics help people grasp the concept of vision, objectives and decision making more than raw mechanics and carrying with high DPS champions. 

Always question your decisions. If you attempted baron and the enemy team came and aced you, then baron was obviously an extremely risky decision that was probably not the best call to make at the time. In solo queue, I try to only go for baron if my team can absolutely, 100% take it safely. The amount of throws done at baron is uncountable. Don't be greedy, do you even need baron? Not if you are 10 kills, 3 towers and inhibitor ahead. Keep pushing the other inhibitors on the map for safer and greater results.

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR. when playing support, become a master tactician. buy wards to give your team vision so that you can make quality decisions on objectives. be your teams leader (even by pinging, not typing) and read the dynamics of the game to put pressure on the map**

1365193460.0,93,self.summonerschool,1br8b5,A whole ton of nifty Thresh gameplay tips.,TacticOgre,111,18,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1br8b5/a_whole_ton_of_nifty_thresh_gameplay_tips/,"Thresh is considered to be one of the strongest supports right now, if not THE strongest. However, he's also quite difficult to master, and taking full and proper advantage of his abilities requires quite a lot of practice and knowledge. After practically maining support Thresh for the past few months, here's a whole bunch of tips I have to share with the community of Summoner School:

**Death Sentence - Q**

* Taking Q at level 1 is pretty much always a must. It's useful in level 1 invasions, and you can often force a flash out of a squishy Sona if you land a hook at level one.

* Once you manage to land a hook on an enemy, don't pull yourself in unless you know you can come out on top. Sometimes landing a hook and letting your AD poke at the enemy while they're being helplessly dragged towards you is more beneficial.

* Due to the ability's long windup time, landing your grab is MUCH easier when an enemy's movement is impaired.  Laning with an ADC who can help you in that regard can be quite useful (Caitlyn's cupcake traps work wonders). Sometimes, it works better to just run into an enemy and initiate with your Flay, or even your ultimate. Any hook you toss out after that will be virtually impossible to miss, even if the enemy flashes away.

* This may be considered slightly wasteful, but one thing I personally like to do when against a difficult lane is to drag enemy cannon minions closer to you. Your AD will have an easier time farming that most valuable minion in the wave, and you'll have an easier time collecting that guaranteed soul. If you're losing a lane, you probably weren't going to engage with that hook anyway.

* Unfortunately, you can't use your hook to manipulate the position of stationary enemy pets, such as Shaco boxes or Heimerdinger turrets. However, you can drag pets like Malzahar's voidling or Elise's spiderlings (Which actually makes those champions difficult to grab themselves).

* If you're worried about your target getting away in a fight, don't hesitate to use the hook in melee range just to immobilize them. The hook can also be used defensively, to drag someone away from an endangered teammate. Volibears and Udyrs hate this the most.

* It can be easy to forget about the passive component of the skill while playing as support. Make use it often in lane, it becomes a very strong poke/harassment tool, especially if you max it first. (which you should, unless you're losing the lane by a ridiculous margin). I personally like AD or ~~armor penetration~~ magic penetration (the damage is actually magical even though it scales off of AD) marks on Thresh for this very reason, the Pickpocket mastery also compliments the skill nicely. While you're alone in lane, it also makes your last hitting a lot easier.

* Check the strength of your Q's passive by looking at its icon on the buff bar - the color changes depending on how much damage you've accumulated, red means maximum. You can also look at Thresh himself, his hook glows green when his Q's damage is at its highest.


**Dark Passage - W** 

* Arguably the best skill in Thresh's arsenal, you generally want to max this ability second for the increased shield and decreased cooldown.

* The most obvious use for the lantern is getting teammates out of sticky situations, but it has lots of other utility and several interesting qualities to it. It allows you to collect souls, it grants some vision (including into brush), and it's even possible to Teleport to it, which can be particularly useful while playing with someone you can voice chat with.

* One notoriously annoying problem with the lantern is that it's very difficult/impossible for your teammate to grab it while an enemy is standing on it. Always try to toss your lantern ahead of where your fleeing teammate is running, that way he/she won't have to backtrack in order to grab it.

* The clickable circle around the lantern is actually a pretty decent size. Because of this, it's possible to toss the lantern slightly inside solid terrain, and still have it be clickable for your teammates. This tip is useful mainly for when you're trying to save someone who's over a wall, but it also comes into play in other occasions. Most notably, if you want to use it to save someone from a Jarvan IV ultimate, it's best to throw the lantern at the side of the arena, rather than the center of it.

* When using the lantern to collect souls, there don't necessarily have to be any souls on the ground at first - while the lantern is there, any souls that appear after it's put down will automatically be gathered. It's usually a good idea to put the lantern down on a wave of enemy minions while recalling to base, that way you may pick up a couple of extra souls you may have otherwise missed.

* You don't always have to use the lantern for escapes. Your teammates will greatly appreciate the mobility when you use it for hopping over walls to get around the jungle faster. What I often like to do is toss it into a jungle camp, and when the person finishes clearing it, they jump to me while the lantern collects the souls from the monsters.

* It's possible to see how much longer your lantern will stay on the ground - There's a small timer circle around it, which gradually decreases over time.

* Once you leave the range of the lantern, Thresh will grab it and hold it himself for a few seconds - this is indicated by the round glowing aura around him. While holding it, you can still grant the shield effect to people by walking up to them. This is particularly useful for when you're farming souls in lane with the lantern. Toss the lantern to collect the souls, walk out of its range in order to grab it, then walk up to your partner to make sure the shield doesn't go to waste.

* The lantern can be an exceptionally powerful enhancement for your jungler's ganks. You can toss it behind you for a from-lane gank, or use it to help your jungler bypass some ward placements. In my experience, the best junglers for lantern ganks are ones with strong all-in ultimates like Malphite, Hecarim and Vi. However, be aware that tossing your lantern backwards can telegraph the gank to your more attentive enemies.

* During all-in lategame teamfights or while doing Baron, don't be afraid to toss down the lantern just for the shield. Shielding five teammates will often prove to be more useful than the pulling component of the ability.

**Flay - E**

* Due to its peculiar targeting scheme, it's pretty unwieldy to use with smartcast, I advise against doing so. Although the slow increases with ranks, I recommend maxing this ability last because the knockback is its main purpose.

* Because it displaces enemies, it's useful for cancelling channeled abilities like Karthus's ultimate. However, as with Death Sentence, you can't move things like Heimerdinger turrets.

* Paired with Thresh's hook, Flay can make for a surprisingly good defense against large minion waves. Knock the minions away with E, and use Q to drag the cannon/super minions away even further.

* When initiating with Q + R, do not use E immediately after. The enemies in range will already be afflicted by the 99% slow of your ultimate for two seconds (Or they'll be stranded inside of the box). Wait for your ultimate to wear off and then use E, in order to chain your crowd control most efficiently. Or if you don't find it necessary, just save your Flay for until a better opportunity in the fight arises.

* (Honestly not much to say about this ability, it's pretty straightforward)

**The Box - R**

* You'd be surprised how much damage this ability can deal even without any offensive items, because of its high base damage, 100% AP scaling and your passive granting you bonus ability power. Even Kage's Lucky Pick helps more than it does on most supports' abilities.

* The obvious and most effective combo is to Amumu yourself into the enemy team with Death Sentence and The Box. However, don't count on hitting all five members as it's virtually impossible with the ability's radius, unless they're ridiculously clumped together. In fact, the radius is deceptively small, which means you shouldn't hesitate and activate the ability immediately upon landing on the enemy team.

* Although you could get away with it with Amumu, Flash + R is not a good idea with Thresh - the radius of the ability is so small that it's rarely an effective combo.

* The Box is its most dangerous at junction spots in the jungle, such as the brush by blue buff. Enemies will be stuck in that area, either they'll touch the walls, or be confined by them.

* While it's best in teamfights and engagements, The Box can also be used in a pinch as a makeshift escape spell. This works particularly well when you're between an escaping ally and a chasing enemy, and once again, it's most effective in the jungle.

* Keep in mind that although it practically immobilizes enemies, it doesn't stop them from autoattacking or casting spells. That means that as an engagement tool, it won't be as effective when the target doesn't necessarily plan on moving from his or her current position.

I've already typed so much, and I still feel like I have so much more to say... So I guess I'll just limit my post to abilities.

I hope you guys enjoy the guide, as always, you re welcome to comment below on anything you think I missed or got wrong. **Remember, by doing so, you're not just helping me but helping the community as a whole!**
 
**Tanking Fundamentals**
 
##The Importance of Tanking, i.e. Your Job

You are the DMG sponge, you initiate fights, you peel for the important Carries. You're an unstoppable monster, a CC machine at times, and maybe even a KS machine as well. You're the reason why enemy teams quake in their boots at your awesome tankiness! I'd rank the importance of you, the Tank, as 3rd most important member on the 5 man team, right behind the AD and AP Carry, for you contribute so much to the team during teamfights and objectives. It's not as easy as one believes either, for tanking is a delicate balance of when and when-not. 

*Exempli Gratii:*

 * When and when-not to engage just cause you caught someone out of position for a teamfight, 'cause if your team isn't ready, you may just end up giving up your life to the enemy team. N.B. Be sure that you know your team is ready to fight, at the blink of your initiation. 

 * When and when-not to blindly stall, if you know back up is coming, for it may be a dangerous gamble if you lack knowledge/vision of where the rest of teh enemy team is. N.B. If you lack vision and knowledge on the whereabouts of most of the enemy team, try not to make risky plays. 

##How to Tank: Key Concepts

You're the Tank, which means your responsibilities are:

 * To initiate fights that are in favor for your team, so that they'll come out on top. 

 * To look like a massive threat, so that you can maximize the probability of soaking up as much DMG as possible from the enemy team. 

 * To peel for your important carries during fights, if needed, so that they may continue on dealing out DMG.

 * To stay alive during teamfights, just in case your team needs help catching stragglers or slippery champions, e.g. Katarina, Kha'Zix, etc., for cleaning up. Stay alive!  Don't be afraid to walk out of the middle of fights when you're low to stay alive, you've done your job. Besides, with you being alive, it could mean the difference between an Ace on the enemy team or a straggler getting away to be able to defend a lane push. 
 
##Who Can Tank

Usually, I would lists the various types of tanks and give examples of which may champions fall into that category, yet since the number of champions that can be considered an actual tank, i.e. not including fighters that just stack HP, are rather minute, I'll just write about each champion that is a tank and explain how he/she works for the team.

**Important Request:** As most of you all know, my students, people who know me on this SubReddit, etc., that I don't often play Jungle or Top, i.e. the Tank Role, but more Mid Lane AP Carry and Support Bot Lane Tank, meaning that some of my information may be wrong, somewhat off, or even lacking in more information. **Please,** as a request from me, if you know anything that I didn't put down and believe that everyone else should know, feel free to put that down in the comments section. Thanks again for helping out the community for those that do so!

**Shen** [](/shen)

&gt; Mainly played in Top Lane and sometimes the Jungle, Shen is very strong champion that excels at being the tank for his team thanks to his innate tankiness, his ability to mitigate DMG with his W, his E AoE Taunt allowing him to perform his job as the tank much easier, and ability to peel and discourage an enemy from attempting to kill an important allied carry. He's a strong laner via his kit, i.e. Magic DMG Q harass + W Shield +  E ability cancellation, in which allows him to win most match-ups and get ahead gold-wise for tanky items. He can splitpush well with a Sunfire Cape + his Passive, with a thanks to his Ultimate, allowing him to peel effectively for teamfights, yet splitpushing hinders him from playing out to his full effectiveness as the team's Tank. 
 
**Malphite** [](/malphite)

&gt; Another Top Laner who can Jungle as well. Is able to perform well thanks to his innate tankiness from his Passive, allowing him to perform his duty as a frontline tank exceptionally well, even though if his DMG potential falls off immensely after 45 minutes. His ultimate, Unstoppable Force, is an amazing initiation tool that can be utilized both offensively and defensively. 

**Sejuani** [](/sejuani)

&gt; Having the the highest win rate out of all champions as of now, thanks to the amazing rework done for her by Riot (good job guys), Sejuani is one of the few tanks who is both innately tanky AND does ""Tons of Damage."" Her ability to do long range initiations, that is an AoE DMG spell, that has hard CC, adds to her already insane versatility in her kit, making her one of the soon-to-be top tier Junglers, if not already. 

**Nautilus** [](/nautilus)

&gt; Being considered one of the top tier junglers who can also tank very well due to his Shield, he is an amazing tank who is able to perform top notch plays thanks to his his kit, allowing him to ""catch"" and initiate fights very well, thanks to both his Ult and his Q. 

**Rammus** [](/rammus)

&gt; Being one of the recommended champions listed under ""tank,"" and as well as being my favorite jungler and tank, Rammus is a hardy tank that gets the job done, due to his stupidly high resistances, and is where he is needed always due to his superior mobility. Very easy to pick up for tanking and jungling, yet requires a lot of skill to master, being that on timing of his E Taunt, Q timing, W timing, and appropriate usage of of his Ult. Although not innately tanky on his own, once he has acquired the HP stacking items he needs, for he does not necessarily need to lots of Resistances, thanks to his W, he is an absolute unkillable monster. I recommend this champion to nayone who enjoys Tanks and fun champions. 

**Alistar** [](/alistar)

&gt; Towering with massive amounts of innate tankiness thanks to his Ult, Alistar is able to take an insane amount of punishment thanks to his ultimate. His ability to CC lock someone is parralel to what would seem like years. A great asset to any team composition, whether that be hard engage, disengage, or even poke. Missing the old days of Jungle Alistar in early Season 2, he still is a strong jungler is able to make the plays needed to snowball his team ahead. 

**Singed** [](/singed)

&gt; Although being classified as ""Fighter,"" Singed is one of the few Fighters who are able to perform as a Tank while also dishing out DMG. Thanks to his Fling he is able to break the positioning of the enemy team and catch enemies who are straggling behind allowing his team to snowball ahead with 5v4s. He is one of the few Tanks that is able to catch back up if completely denied during lane phase, due to the fact that he scales so well thanks to his Ult and kit. 

**Cho'Gath** [](/chogath)

&gt;  He is one of the harder Tanks to play, in my experience, due to the fact that his Knock Up is fairly hard to land in higher ELOs where players are used to dodging skillshots, his Stacks are hard to keep up if the enemy team knows how to exploit Cho'Gath's early game weakness, i.e. his early game squishiness. He is, however, unkillable to once he attains the amount of HP and Stacks that he needs to Tank from getting ahead. 

**Amumu** [](/amumu)

&gt; Fairly weak early game, due to the fact that he can be easily denied in the jungle from counter-jungling and is relatively squishy during the early phases of the game. Can tank well once he acquires items and is ahead, if not, Amumu is limiteed to helping his team through purely catching out enemy champions or timing his ult appropriately, yet that may prove difficult if you're behind and lack the HP to tank fights long enough to time your Ults perfectly.

**Dr. Mundo** [](/mundo)

&gt; Being feared during most of Season 2 for his insane HP-stacking Tankiness, coupled with just silly amounts of HealthReg, made Mundo nearly unkillable in fights. Thanks to his HP % DMG and AoE Potential, he can deal a considerable amount of DMG for a tank. 

**Trundle** [](/trundle)

&gt; *Lacking in credible information on Champion since rework, please someone in the community can possibly fill this in for me.* 

**Maokai** [](/maokai)

&gt; Being chosen as the Pro Player Pick by The Odd One, all the information he stated was, in fact, correct, of course, he's a professional, I'm not. Point being, Maokai is a very strong Jungle Tank who can take a large amount of punishment thanks to the DMG Reduction from his Ult. Although he's relatively squishy during the early stages of the game and timing on his abilities can be crucial. 

**Volibear** [](/volibear)

&gt; A very strong Tank who is a strong Initiator for his team. Innately tanky throughout the entirety of the game, thanks to relatively high base Armour and MR stats. Deals a considerable amount of DMG thanks to his 15% DMG Bite.  

**Hecarim** [](/hecarim)

&gt; The Tank Pony. A strong Tank who excels at being the Initiator in his team, and thanks to his AoE Heal/Leech, he never dies. He scales very well into Mid and Late game DMG-wise, ALSO while scaling as a pure Tank. 

**Thresh** [](/thresh)

&gt; *Lacking in information on Jungle/Tank Thresh NOT Support Thresh, who lacks items to be tanky, unless it is Late Late Game, if someone could kindly fill me in on Jungle/Tank Thresh, that would be very appreciated.*
  
##When To Peel

 * *Peeling* -  The act of completely removing any threat from the target champion/ally in which you are peeling for with your kit/abilities, or presence.. 
 
It's actually slightly hard to determine when to peel and when to initiate yourself, for if you choose one, there's no turning back, and in League of Legends either can be the defining moment of a Victory or Defeat, so choose carefully and wisely. Ideally, you'll want to peel for an important carry if:

 * You have another champion on your team who is able to initiate either better or on-par with your abilitties, this being so that you can maximize the effectiveness of both initiating and peeling mechanics without having the loss for either

 * If the sole DMG source is a single carry in which you have to peel for, and everyone on the enemy team is diving him/her. Exactly on top of the ""Peel for the Kog'Maw"" phrase or ""Peel for Doublelift"" motto of CLG.

##When To Initiate

 * Generally, you'll want to initiate, at least this is a golden rule for me, if:

  * If it's a 5v5 ""hover,"" e.g. nobody's doing anything except dancing outside of one another, and somebody on the enemy team:

   * Blows an important cooldown, e.g. Enemy Ezreal uses his Trueshot Barrage to clear the oncoming wave of minions, Katarina uses Shunpo to reposition herself, etc.

   * If you have champion, or are playing a champion who excels at catching people out of position, e.g. Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Leona, etc.

   * If you know you can win a straight fight due to your team having the superior composition, e.g. An AoE composition will generally beat out most other compositions, except disengage comps. 

  * If it's an 5v4 or below for the enemy team, e.g. the enemy AP Carry shows Top Lane, farming that lane, and everyone else is in Bot Lane or far away enough so that that enemy AP Carry can't make a contribution to the fight. 

  * **Important:** I'd recommend that you have excessively good map coverage, i.e. wards, before you engage at all! most important when you catch someone important, AD or AP Carry, out of position. Do not get yourself kill due to lack of ward coverage. Having good ward coverage can be the difference between securing an Ace for your team or having 2 or 3 stragglers get away to defend the base. 

  * ""Surprise Initiations"" out of FoW can be a devastating surprise for the enemy team, and at times, can even seal the deal with some games, especially if your team is gap-close/AoE based, e.g. Tank Leona Flash + E + W + Q + R, over, say, Dragon wall while the enemy team is doing Dragon, followed up by an ally Katarina, Jarvan IV, Miss Fortune, &amp; Riven. 
 
**Itemization, Runes &amp; Masteries**
 
##Items

 * *To-Be Added*
 
##Runes

I have two general rune sets for any tanks that I play, that differ for whether or not I go as the Jungler or as the Support Laner

**Note:** For the Tank Jungler Rune set, please understand that I play Support Junglers, e.g. Rammus, Maokai, etc.

**Rune Set #1**

&gt; Name: Tanky Support Jungler

&gt; 9x Flat Armour Marks

&gt; 9x Scaling HP per Lvl Seals

&gt; 9x Flat MR Glyphs

&gt; 3x Quintessences of MS

&gt; Reasoning: My goal in this and purpose is to be the tankiest person on the team, especially as a Jungler, my goals isn't to get kills through ganks and snowball from that myself and carry, e.g. champions like Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, etc., no, my friend, it's to gank all the lanes and snow ball them, cause, in my mindset, 2 lanes snowballing can carry games harder than me just carrying by myself, plus its easier this way for Solo Queue. Point being, it allows me to to do early tower dives, and make silly plays as I tank any enemy DMG.

**Rune Set #2**

&gt; Name: Support Tank

&gt; 9x Flat Armour Marks

&gt; 9x Flat HP Reg Seals

&gt; 9x Flat MR Glyphs

&gt; 3x GP 10 Quintessences

&gt; Reasoning: This allows me to play my favorite Tank Support, Leona, the Radiant Dawn, as a hyper aggressive ""kill"" support. For any engagement that I make that isn't rewarded with a kill, I can simply shrug off thanks to the help of an Armour Bonus and the HP Reg Seals (Equivalent HP Reg of a Doran's Shield). The GP 10 Quints will put you slightly ahead of the enemy support allowing you to get more Wards out or finish a big ticket item quicker, which is huge as a support. 

##Masteries

You've got two ideal choices as a **Tank:**

**Mastery Page #1**

&gt; Name: Tanky Support/Jungler **""Snowballing Other Lanes""**

&gt; 0/9/21

&gt; Reasoning: Sometimes, when you're attempting to Support other lanes and are trying to snowball them, you can't acquire those important Boots of Mobility [](/bootsofmobility) as quickly as you'd like, yet with these Masteries, they allow you to make up for any loss of MS, allowing you to be wherever you're needed. Recommended if you're confident in your successful ganking potential to get off ganks rather than stay in the jungle.

**Mastery Page #2**

&gt; Name: Superior Jungle Tank **""Play-For-Late Tank""**

&gt; 0/21/9

&gt; Reasoning: A much safer mastery page to go with if you wish to solely help out in teamfights and have your entire team snowball off of those. Scales well into late game, and makes a significant difference during the earlier stages of the game when you're making ""risky"" plays. If you're uncomfortable with your ganking potential and believe that you may have to perform more tanking than usual, i.e. diving an enemy under his/her tower, take these masteries.

I'm sick of that word. Everyone thinks that ""viability"" is the be-all and end-all of playing a champion, but no one actually THINKS about viability, they just assume champs are viable or not based on what they see on streams and in LCS matches. Here's the thing.

Voyboy not playing a champion doesn't mean it isn't viable.

LCS teams not playing a champion doesn't mean it's not viable.

Every champion in the game - *every. single. one.* - is viable in solo queue. ""But Karma-"" No. Karma is viable. ""But Heimerdinger-"" No. Heimer is viable. They may not be able to be universally first picked, but they're viable: you can play them and be successful. Maybe not every game, but there is no champion in League of Legends with a guaranteed 100% success rate.

This does not mean I'm saying go out and fuck around with ridiculous builds every chance you get - running AP Sivir because she has one AP ratio, or what have you, because there's a difference between champion viability and build viability - but it means stop questioning viability and play the damn champion. Find out what they're good at, find out what they're bad at. Find out situations where you can pull out that niche pick and do well with it. I remember terrifyingly well getting rolled by a Karma mid in a ranked 5s game because our mid player didn't know how to deal with it and the Karma got fed early and became an unstoppable force lategame. Watching Dan Dinh stomp games with Heimerdinger made me realize he's a pretty strong champion in the right place and time. 

It is possible to win with every champion in the game. Stop saying ""is [insert really obviously viable champ here] viable? I haven't seen [insert player's favorite streamer here] play him; does this mean he's not viable?"" Go play the damn champion for yourself. Stop relying on third party sources for all of your information. 

And no, AP glass cannon Shen is not viable. Sorry. 

EDIT based on comments.

If you want to ask ""why is [champion] better than [other champion]"" or something along those lines, that's cool. I can understand wanting to determine why to pick one champ over another in a given situation. No harm done by such questions, just word them as such if that's the information you're looking for.

Remember that you need good warding for this !


**1. LANE PHASE : How to let minions win your role.**

Here, you should always collect enough power for yourself, and deny as much as possible to your opponent. This power is gained mostly from minions and that's why this is such an important subject for me. 


**Important : Untill your team is ready to transition to the next phase of this game, it helps alot when you are ahead on your opponent.**


* TOP/MID Counter Tactics


When you are scared of your enemy's potential, these are some common strategies to (ab)use the power of minions to win against your opponent. Being aggressive while he/she farms is often the best defense against their potential. You have to **put pressure on your opponent.**

|    Situation    |                     Description                   |                                         Required Action                                     |

|                   |                                                       |and you can farm safely under your tower. Clean them as fast as you can | 
|                   |                                                       |so you'll be ready for ganks.                                                              |


* 1.1 Toplane


There are several kinds of toplaners out there, I'll list you the most common ones and some tips to help you control your lane-opponent. Combine all of them for the complete picture. It's not about the champion, but how you can use your abilities to pressure your opponent and his base, without having to fight.


|        Description       |             Examples                      |              Lane Control                   |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|   Main Tank             | [](/zac) [](/shen) [](/singed)       |Poke, don't trade unless you can.     |
|   Off Tank               | [](/wukong) [](/renekton)           |Zone from farm/experience.              |   
|   Assassins             | [](/akali) [](/zed) [](/diana)         |Shut down early, don't give free gold.|
|   Any                     | [](/teemo) [](/vayne)                 |Deny xp under his tower.                 |                   

ROAMING =&gt; ONLY when you are denying him farm. This is also when his minionwave is bigger and you see a garanteed gank or objective. Else it's not worth it to leave your lane. OR when your teammates really require your help, losing your top tier 1 turret is alot better than your mid's tier 2 turret. 


* 1.2 Midlane


Most midlaners are AP champions that have incredible scaling on their abilities, consistent damage and/or other utility in teamfights. You require good farm and kills to snowball. There are two things to consider :

=&gt; You need alot of ward coverage because your lane has alot of entrances and angles for enemies to gank.
=&gt; You can roam the quickest to the lane that needs it the most, when you have pushed your minions towards her/his tower.

Any advantage you get from other lanes are always usefull to help you 1v1 your opponent. Make sure he can't clean-up after you succeed in a gank, go pressure his/her turret once more.


* 1.3 Botlane

Push down your tower when you are ahead on your opponent, so he is even more exposed to being caught out. But do this slowly, just clear their minionwaves and let your minions damage the tower. This will keep you ahead of him on experience and enable you to go for kills when you see the opportunity. Remember that you can't let their AD carry get back into the game, and you need to abuse the fact that he doesn't have a tier 1 turret anymore to protect him. 

If you roam, remember to pressure other turrets before they can do that to you !


* 1.4 Jungler

This is probably the most important role during this phase when you want to ensure pressure on your opponents. He can help a lane that is getting pressured or help another lane to pressure even more. He should always push your lane when you and your opponent are gone. Lanefarm is incredibly strong right now on any jungler. He helps you when you get pressured, and he helps you pressure your opponent, so he aids you in winning your lane. He can't be everywhere at the same time, so you might get pressured too much but if your other lanes are winning and pressuring their opponents with the jungler, it's still worth it. As a jungler, you have to decide which opponent needs to be pressured at which time. You are the driver, that can decide whether your team will come out the strongest when you decide to group and push.


**2. OBJECTIVES PHASE : How to pressure objectives**


How to chose ? How to pick out the right objective to pressure ? An overview of the objectives with rising priority in order to pressure your opponent.


| Priority |            Description          |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|    1     |INHIBITOR                        |
|    2     |TIER 3 TURRET                  |
|    3     |TIER 2 TURRET                  |
|    4     |BARON NASHOR                 |
|    5     |TIER 1 TURRET                  |
|    6     |DRAGON                           |
|    7     |CHAMPION KILL                 |

However, taking one objective without pressure, enables you to pressure even more. Have you just killed your opponents in botlane ? Push and go Dragon. Did you just take out an inhibitor and your other turrets aren't getting pressured ? Go Baron Nashor. Keep pressuring your opponents with minions, and you'll have better control over jungle objectives and the minionwaves.


* 2.1 Dragon

This is extra gold for you and your allies. However, it's not worth it to take Dragon while one of your towers is getting destroyed, because **taking down turrets is more beneficial for map control.**

* 2.2 untill 2.4 Turrets

Each turret that you have more on one lane, will provide pressure. You can clear a wave further away from your own towers to empower this pressure. **Require your enemies to regularly clear the lane after you pushed.**

* 2.5 Inhibitors

The pressure from this objective is incredible, and should always be continued in a chain-reaction. After you take one down, go for another one or remove remaining turrets from the map. They'll have trouble following your team towards other objectives once you destroy an inhibitor, and every objective you can take while they're busy protecting their Nexus brings you in a higher position and draws the win towards you slowly. Taking out one objective at the right time can guarantee a kill, even when you seem to be losing teamfights !

* 2.6 Baron Nashor

This enables you to push harder towards an objective. Sometimes you'll need it to take down an inhibitor, but the most ideal situation is that you destroy an inhibitor, take Baron while they're defending their base and pressure another lane. Enables you to pressure longer aswell.


**3. HOW TO PUSH A WAVE ?**

To push a wave the best way, you need to kill their minions in the following order when they attack your minions ! Any minion that shoots/battles one of your minions always has the highest priority over one that's not attacking your minions ! You can aggro the minions to naturally push your lane. The following sequence is how hard minions hit.

| Minion priority |               Description                |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|         1          |Super Minion                             |
|         2          |Cannon Minion                           |
|         3          |Ranged Minion                           |
|         4          |Melee Minion                             |


If you can succesfully make your wave push, your wave will get bigger at the next conflict, and pressures your enemy even more. This gives you the time and opportunity to look for the next objective.

**RULE 1 WHILE TAKING OBJECTIVES = ""There is always a next objective to pressure untill you destroy their Nexus. Knowing which one is the best to go for, is an act of map awareness, teamwork and reaction speed.""**",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1371396335.0,,default,True,t3_1ggcau,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ggcau/how_to_let_minions_win_your_game_general_guide/,
1374392712.0,86,self.summonerschool,1iqpk7,The ISE principle of champion select,Tuchit,102,16,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1iqpk7/the_ise_principle_of_champion_select/,"I'm currently laddering a smurf, and I've noticed that a lot of people in lower leagues tend to have a lot of trouble carrying games because they flat out choose the wrong champions. To put things simply, it's not really about counter picks, and it's not really about team compositions, but it's more about them not following what I call the ISE principle: That you should try to main **Independent, Strong, and Easy** champions.

**Independent**

An independent champion is a champion that can lane against a large variety of enemy champions without help from jungle. Independent champions are good wave clearers, have good mobility, and are strong duelists.

Karthus is not an independent champion. If you're playing Karthus and you get put up against Katarina or Diana of equal skill, *you're going to need help.* You have placed an unnecessary burden on your teammates. Yes, Karthus is a powerful champion, and yes, he can work, but right now he's an incredibly risky pick because of the number of assassins in the game who can deny him farm. 

Compare this to Ahri. Ahri is very independent. She has few counter picks, good sustain, and she has a great ult. She can win her lane against a variety of opponents alone. Ahri is, for all intents and purposes, a better solo queue pick than Karthus. Lane independence is an extremely important concept in climbing the ladder.

**Strong**

A strong champion is a champion that is, without a shadow of a doubt, strong. Strong champions are usually obvious to pick out, but some people simply *insist* that their Heimerdinger or Galio is just the most OP thing ever. These people tend to be at Silver 4 with 300 games played in the division.

You need to pick a strong champion. You can't beat the meta with some unpredictable pick. Yes, there *are* some secretly strong champions, who you should try to figure out for yourself, but for the most part the strongest champions in the game are already fairly well known. Galio is currently a weak champion. So is Heimerdinger. So is Karma. So is Poppy. So is Shyvana. They *can* be strong under the right circumstances, but for the most part, you're just entering a swordfight with a pocket knife when you play them.

**Easy**

Easy champions are not that difficult to play, and players can excel with them even with lower mechanical skills. Don't get me wrong--I'm not saying you're incompetent--but easy champions excel in solo queue because they tend to be very forgiving of small mistakes. A lot of professionals even center their entire champion pool around champions that are easy to play, so it's not just you.

Jayce is an extremely hard champion (contrary to popular belief). Vayne is even harder, and the biggest newbie trap in the game. Somebody sees Doublelift smashing a game with Vayne, and believes that if they were to practice her for a few weeks nonstop, they could do the same. It doesn't work like that. If you were to put the same amount of effort into learning an easier ADC, like Caitlyn, Kog'Maw, or Graves, you would do far better for your time investment.

On the other hand, Ryze is a very easy champion to play, and the only thing challenging about him is dodging longer ranged skillshots. Malphite top is quite simple in most matchups, and Kennen is actually not hard at all with a bit of practice. These three champions also happen to be independent and strong, and can be a very nice part of a champion pool for solo queue. 

**ISE**

I know i know, its obvious and maybe a little rude to say, but it is mostly your fault you are where you are, follow steps like these ( Which again, i know they've been repeated over and over. )

1.Watch Replays of your games, find out where you went wrong, and correct it, never make the same mistake twice.

2.assume your enemy knows what their doing, but try to capitalize on their mistakes. What may look like a stupid idea from your point of view may be Top 5 Plays material from theirs, but this doesn't mean you should let them get away with everything they try

3.Know your enemy, I know its a game, but if your serious about climbing Elo/Ladders, ( and if you play ranked often, i really hope you are ) then you need to know as much as possible, this means having at least a basic grasp of how every champion works

4.Skill &gt; Counters, This is almost always the case, a pro Gangplank will beat an Irelia who only played Irelia because shes a counter, same goes for almost any picks.

5.Play cautious, Unless the score is 20/0, you should be as careful as possible while pushing your advantage, or trying to take away your enemies,Yes, this does mean you might have to let them get away with 50 health sometimes. combine those 5 tips with all of the other tips found regularly on Reddit and the internet in general, along with the Second step to climbing.


Second: The harder, Less obvious one Help the community. No, I don't mean helping the community in terms of Fan art or what have you, i mean literally, if you know enough about the game, you should be teaching everyone you can about it. Too often to i hear people complain and say things like "" Oh i just lost my last game, noob team you know? "" What did you do to stop them from being noobs? If you don't help them, How do you expect to get matched with better people, Face it, everyone Needs help at some point, whether it be with builds or mechanics or tactics. Look at Pro's such as Voyboy, I'll admit i don't watch streams much, but in the maybe 3 hours i've spent watching streams, each streamer has tried to help his ( or her ) viewers to learn more about the game, which, is probably why you're watching the stream anyway. You may not always get the role you want, face it, would you rather have a Troll/Feeder in your game, or get Top lane? Because if you think about it, It doesn't Matter if you got Top, because you deprived this guy of his role, causing him to throw a tantrum.


We have the Technology ( /r/summonerschool[1] /r/LeagueofLegendsMeta[2] ) So lets use it to make the community a better place, and get the Hell out of Bronze/Silver
Good luck, HF, Pay it forward.
 

****Edit***: This is being received a lot better here than on the LoL subreddit, and for that, i'm kind of glad, it shows that the people here truly have interest in getting better and helping out, and that they don't just want free advice. Good on you.


I'd also like to mention that while none of you have brought it up, I know Athene is currently trying to change the community for the better, and i'm basically trying to do the same thing, except on a smaller scale, and without raging over which role i get.

* Also don't be the one who rages. Verbally attacking teammates has never done anything to win games. 90% of chat is unnecessary chatter.
* Analyze everything you do, as you do it. What worked, what didn't. Does something feel risky about this play? Maybe you should reconsider this dive. Did you just win a 1v1? How did you make it happen? Missed that CS? How can you prevent missing any more?
* Patience. Rome was not conquered in a day. Wear your opponent down, slowly overpower him in lane. During 5v5 engages, look for the right moment to strike a decisive blow, focusing the key targets and securing victory for your team. **Everyone makes mistakes in a game.

1362419860.0,85,self.summonerschool,19ndtq,How to learn... Learning and Mindset,Angel_of_Clumsiness,99,14,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19ndtq/how_to_learn_learning_and_mindset/,"**Greetings Summoners!**


I'm looking to post a series of guides, teaching not only basic concepts of the game and their related skills, but, more importantly, a detailed look on *how* these things can be acquired and how to learning progress works. So before I go into ""How To Learn...Lasthitting/MapAwareness/LearningNewChampions"" I figured I'll give some general advice in regards to learning and mindset within League of Legends.



**Baby Steps**

Learning things can be a bitch. Think of school...few people really like memorizing the capitals of all african countries (care to name Lesotho's?), enjoy plotting a graph to a random f(x) or rejoice upon learning the exact specifics of the propagation cycle of the common tapeworm. Granted, there are some who do (and I envy each and everyone of you), but most people don't. There's just not much joy in it, and we tend to have subpar performances at things we dont enjoy.

It really is a pity. Small children enjoy learning *everything*. They face the world with a feeling of wonder and exploration where everything is new and fascinating and worth investing in, and if you fall down while learning how to put *this* foot in front of *that one*, you get up and try again, no harm done.

Then you grow up, and suddenly the floor looks scary. How come?

Somewhere along the way, most people learn that it's *bad to make mistakes*. The surroundings reinforce this by telling you how this or that is wrong or by giving your accomplishments a rating (school grades, anyone?) and generally making your life hell for just even *trying*.

Sounds familiar?

Yeah, the League is a pretty unkind learning environment.

There's this friend of mine, he just started upon hearing me and my mates chat about LoL. It's a pretty fascinatig thing. Colorful champions, flashy abilities, the glamour of the pro scene and an infinitely high skillcap. So i took him under my wing and we started bashing some bots. He was extatic. That Enchanted Crystal Arrow is soooo strong. Oh, I get extra gold! I can buy moar swords! Why is a slow even good, this does nothing. This Nunu Bot is sooo annoying.... aaand so on. It was awesome to behold.

Then he started playing with other human beings. You can figure out the caveat in there. Needless to say, there was a motivational slump after the first few games. Go figure.



**Zen-Zap**

The first advice I gave him was: If someone makes your game unenjoyable in chat, **mute** him (You can do that by pressing TAB, there are small speech bubbles on the right side, a click and it's done). There's just no reason to endure a barrage of insults in your free time (or anywhere else, for that matter). This is a really easy thing to do to enhance your learning experience.

But that's about all you can do to control external factors, i.e. other players. You can't make them play better, or stop feeding, or miraculously learn to ward and teamfight. There is absolutely NOTHING that can change that (that's kind of a lie, but lets keep it at that for now). The only thing you can do is change how you react to this kind of things.

It's all about finding your inner Zen.

Not easy, that. If it was easy, we would all be Buddha or Jesus or Ghandi. Luckily, not everyone needs to be fat, or grow long hair or smell of indian spices to enjoy a little bit of serenity here and there. Onwards to some actual advice!

* *Do not expect your teammates to be good*. It is teh Interwebz after all, and the statistical probability of a lurking troll jumping out under the proverbial bridge is pretty high. So why not come prepared? Now don't say things like ""they are all idiots anyway"", because this kind of negativity will color your game. Instead just give yourself room to be pleasantly surprised. Get your emotional Warmog's on (and your helmet of troll resistance, +10 vs feeding), shrug at the bad guys, be happy with the good ones.

* *Do not expect to win*. This one is really counter-intuitive. After all, you *need* to want to win to actually have a shot at winning. Also, wanting to improve/to win is what motivates us (and what caused you to read this in the first place). The thing is, don't take it for granted that you actually DO win. Taking things for granted is the Road To The Ragequit. People generally get angry only if they got something tangible to loose (like your image of self-worth as defined by a playing game), and after all is said and done, it really is ""just"" a game. One you can invest in, take dead serious, learn about in the small hours of the night, root for in tournaments, and, for some, even make a living out of - and its still a game. You have to let go of the things you love most. :)

* *Give credits to your enemies*. Yep. You have all the feeders and they always have that 22/0 Katarina. And No, its not just because all your teammates play on the intellectual level of a baked potato. I mean, that strong player might actually be good? Treat it like you would a tiger in the zoo. There's this mix of dread and respect when facing 250kg of claw tipped fur and muscle capable of ripping your face off in seconds. Now imagine facing that in the lane (where it can go invis and jump at you out of bushes). It might turn out to be a mangy old housecat after all, but you have no way of knowing in advance, and it might transform from one into the other. All allegories aside, underestimating the players on the enemy team leads to (but is not limited to): blaming your teammates, feeding the enemy kills, doing stupid things yourself, getting increasingly frustrated, raging, ragequitting, unhappiness and world hunger. And all that aside, respect for the opponent is pretty healthy and a show of good sportsmanship.

Well, this rapidly turned into a kind of generic do-this-and-get-platinum-for-free guide. The thing I am mostly interested in, though, is not ""how to win"" but rather ""how to enjoying learning and getting better"". And before I dive in to the actual mechanics of learning (dividing brainpower and internalization, stay tuned for the next episode!) I felt it important to lay down a bit of *emotional* groundwork in preparation. You kinda need the sweetspot between not caring enough to improve and caring too much to be objective about. Both lead to not having very much fun, and learning without fun is kinda like going to school (...again. For me at least).



**Closing Words**

Wall of Text coming to an end here. There are a ton of ""mindset""-advice-posts on reddit but most agree on trying to ditch negative attitude (blaming others) in favor of a more serene state of mind focused on self-improvement, because relegating responsability to others makes you routine-blind regarding your own missteps and therefore keeps you from improving. This in itself is kind of an unpleasant thing to do and pretty hard to learn, as it forces you to tone down your mechanisms of self-protection (keeping away the things that hurt, a.k.a. blaming others) and relearn things in a more open, humble way. It really DOES lead to aHappierLifeThroughGaming, I can assure you that over the smell of incense permeating my desk.


Sincerely Yours,

*Angel of Clumsiness*
 
 
 

**AboutMe**: I'm moderately good at this game, enjoy analyzing, philosophical nonsense and have a huge passion for teaching. I'm also probably a lot better at teaching it than at the game itself, on account of my sluggish reaction times. I go by the summoner name of AngelOfClumsines - there's an ""s"" missing due to not having enough character(s).


*Disclaimer I* - I wrote this in a rather blog-esque way without much structure. Feel free to comment, add, correct, opinionize, antagonize and discuss in any way. I would very much like to expand on my musings, see if there is a demand for this kind of things.

*Disclaimer II* - While I see myself as pretty fluent in the english language, it is not my native tongue. Please point out missused words, typos and all other nonsense so i can correct it.

*Disclaimer III* - I was unsure where to post this, so I went with the SummonerSchool. Hope this is the right place :)


*Edit*: How can I ad spaces between paragraphs? I'm kinda new to this thing here :)

1st Example, will be cleaned up later.

[Tatertot](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20634517#profile), a recently promoted Diamond ADC main, had this to say on some ADC related questions:

* What Summoner Spells should I take? Any special conditions?
&gt; For summoners you always take flash, you need it for proper postioning and saftey. Your second summoner should be a response to the enemy team comp. If the enemy team has a large amount of CC, cleanse is the way to go. If you want to stomp your lane and win trades, take ignite. If you feel like you need some more protection and saftey, take heal/barrier.

* Which ADCs do you think have the most impact currently and why?
&gt; Currently I think Twitch, Ezreal, Graves, MF, and Caitlyn are some of the strongest ADCs. Ezreal, Graves, and Caitlyn all have fairly reliable escapes and each bring something different to the table. Graves brings a lot of burst and is fairly tanky. Caitlyn has the longest range out of the ADCs without any skills/passives influencing range. Ezreal has great poke and has a global ult. MF is good right now because of the combination of her ult and armor pen. She also has a strong laning phase that can lead to snowballing. Twitch is a great carry to have in a team as long as you can protect him; if you protect Twitch he will output some crazy damage in teamfights. His stealth is somewhat of an escape but can be unreliable. Also I believe Vayne may come back very soon with her buffs. A combination of buffing her scaling attack speed and the new Blade of the Ruined king (gives attack speed) Vayne could be another great ADC if you have the team to protect her.

* What do you look for in your support?  Agression / protection?
&gt; I look for a support who can be aggressive/passive when needed. For example, when I have a Leona support while I'm Ezreal, we aim to engage fights and instantly burst down either the ADC or support. When I have a support such as Lulu, I look for Lulu to slowly poke down my laning opponents with me so I can gain a lead in the lane. After the laning phase I look for a support who can protect me during fights. Some good support+ADC combos for laning are Gravs/Taric, Ezreal/Sona, Twitch/Lulu.

_____________

_____________


*A first pass through some of the ideas:*

**General Mechanics:**

* Last Hitting
&gt; Last Hitting is the processes of killing a minion by Auto Attacking (AA).  This can be done by either right-clicking the minion or A-Moving (discussed later) with the minion being the closest target to you.  Last Hitting is commonly known as CSing.  (Derived from the term Creep Score.)
&gt;
&gt; * Why is last hitting important? 
&gt;
&gt; Last hitting helps you with lane control and gives you the gold you will need for items later on.

* Lane Control
&gt; The ability to keep the minions in an advantageous position for yourself while keeping your opponents at bay.  This is a crucial skill to have in all lanes; as it will allow your jungler to gank for you and, when done correctly, will allow you to CS safely and make the opposing side have a hard time getting farm.

I have split the AD carries into a few different sub categories based on when they are at their peak strength, this does not mean an early game carry is bad late game unless specifically noted. This is the first thing I've done in this format and I may adjust formatting or content as I see fit. Depending on how this is received I may do a few more similar pieces but we shall see. Enjoy.

__________________________________
**Late Game AD's**

* [](/tristana) 

Tristana has some of the highest early game burst of the AD carries and can be very scary when paired with an aggressive support. However in order for her to land her burst she has to commit 100% and will have no escape other then flash. If you can survive her burst do not be afraid to fight her as her auto attack dps is very low early game. She has the weakest midgame of all the AD carries bringing little damage and utility as her spells have no AD scaling. However, if she can get past her midgame she becomes one of the strongest late game carries in the game having the 3rd highest damage output of all the AD carries while being the hardest AD carry to kill in the game with her 703 range and her 2 escapes + flash. Do not stall out a game against a tristana as she will almost always out scale your AD carry.

* [](/kogmaw) 

Kog'maw is the definition of the late game AD carry boasting 710 possible range and the second highest damage output of the AD's. He pays for this with a lack of mobility and decently low base defensive stats. His early game isn't particularly strong as both his range and damage require time to scale up, however once he gets a few levels and a bit of attack speed he becomes a formidable threat midgame and only gets stronger. You should attempt to bully him early and zone him as much as possible before he is strong as like the other AD's in the category he will out scale your AD carry. It should be noted that his poke is rather powerful especially with blue buff.

* [](/vayne) 

Vayne has a rather weak early few levels as she is entirely based on auto attacks and has low base defensive stats and 550 range. However at level 6 she gets a massive boost in survivability and damage output. She has a strong mid game and an amazing late game boasting the highest damage output of all the AD carries while having a stealth disengage. She is a fantastic chaser and the best dueling AD carry past midgame. She has issues with AoE CC and damage spells however as often she will have to be in range of them to do damage. Additionally her disengage can be countered by oracles. Try to abuse her early game weakness and end the game before she can hit her stride as she will nearly always out scale your AD carry.

* [](/ashe) 

I have Ashe here not because of her damage output which is the lowest of all the AD carries, but her utility which becomes more and more significant as the game progresses. Ashe has a relatively weak early game but can be fairly safe with her 600 range and on command slow. Post level six she can set up ganks for her jungler in her both her lane and other lanes with her ulti. She doesn't really have a damage spike at any point in the game but the longer the game goes the more game changing her ultimate can be as catching a single person out of place can win a game by itself. You can often abuse Ashe somewhat in lane and she won't out scale your damage, but be careful of her even if she is behind as her stun and slows are a major factor even if she lacks a lot of damage.

**Mid Game AD's**

* [](/graves)

Graves is an interesting AD, playing as an AD caster for the early phase of the game and transitioning into an AD carry role mid-late game. He has powerful burst early game while having rather good defensive stats with his passive. Paired with an aggressive support he can easily burst down a target especially post 6. His 525 range however lets him get bullied by longer ranged carries and keeps his late game in check. If you can dodge his skills you can usually win a fight with him  so don't be afraid to fight. His smokescreen is a powerful zone control ability at all stages of the game. His high AD scaling on his abilities makes him one of the strongest AD's in the midgame and his dash keeps him relatively safe from bruisers.  Graves has a lot of problems siegeing towers with his short range and lack of long ranged poke however, and it is easier to defend vs. him then a lot of AD carries. Like many AD carries he is vulnerable to AoE damage and AoE CC.

* [](/ezreal)

Ezreal has both powerful burst damage and poke throughout the early midgame. His skill shots have very long range letting him harass or even farm at a very long distance. He is highly mobile but if you can engage on him he is very vulnerable to burst damage as he has low base defensive stats. His AS slow makes him a very strong duelist so if he hits you with it you should typically disengage unless you are significantly ahead. He has 550 range so he is vulnerable to AoE damage and CC however he can contribute to a fight even without being in auto attack range. He is a relatively strong poker all game but has a lower damage output then a lot carries and is among the squishiest.

* [](/corki)

Corki offers significant early game burst damage with his spells as well as fantastic poke post 6. He has high kill potential in lane especially when combined with an aggressive support like taric or Leona. Corki's valkyrie is very mana intensive so it should be used very sparingly. Corki trades very well early game with his bonus damage from his passive steroid and zero cast time spells. Midgame his armor shred make him and his team more do significantly more damage to their targets so avoid the gatling gun AoE. He is very mana dependent for damage especially if he rushes trifocre so be sure to watch his mana bar and do not be afraid to engage when he is low mana. Corki like many AD's has 550 range and is vulnerable to AoE damage and CC.

* [](/sivir)

Sivir has a lot of early game damage and wave clear with her boomerang and ricochet, however her damage is dodgable. Her spell shield makes her deceptively strong against ability focused AD's and aggressive supports despite her 500 range. Her damage scales very well throughout the game but her range prevents her from being a late game goddess. Her ultimate shines most of AD focused teams with 3 heavy sources of physical damage. Her ultimate also makes her and her team excellent at chasing and disengaging. She is an excellent tower pusher and defender but is a mediocre tower sieger due to her low range. Early game she is reliant on her boomerang for damage so if you can manage to avoid it you should be able to out trade her. She has major issues against AoE damage and CC from champions like kennen as she has the lowest range of the AD's.

**Early Game AD's**

* [](/caitlyn) 

Caitlyn has some of the best early game harassment and lane control with her 650 range and traps. She has a strong wave clear and can put a lot of early pressure on towers safely. Cait's escape has a windup and doesn't move her all that much for the cast time so don't rely on it too heavily. Cait's midgame and late game are neither horrible or noteworthy. Cait excels at tower sieges and defenses with her range and traps. Most carries can out damage cait but her range lets her stay relevant. Cait has relatively low burst damage but excellent poke so if you can hard engage you will often win the exchange. Be mindful of her ult as it is a potent execution throughout the game.

* [](/missfortune)

Miss Fortune has extremely strong early game damage with her auto attacks and you should avoid exchanges with her early in the game. She has a surprising amount of burst damage despite being auto attack based. Her ult does a lot of damage in a large AoE early game but falls off quickly. Her passive makes her extremely mobile around the map and makes her one of the strongest roaming AD carries. She lacks team fight mobility however and her short range makes her very vulnerable to the enemy. Her damage is very average in the mid and late game but she is a relatively strong duelist due to her healing debuff and stacking magic damage. Her 550 range leaves her vulnerable to AoE damage and CC.

* [](/varus) 

Varus has a very strong laning phase with his high damage poke and passive steroid allowing him to bully his opponent very hard. Varus is also one of the few AD's with hard CC making ganks and engages in bot lane easier then with many AD's. If you can dodge varus's Q then you should be able to out trade him in lane. Varus's strength is in his poke and his damage falls off when the lane phase ends. Varus's 575 range makes him safe from a lot of AoE damage and CC however and leaves him a decent sieger. Varus has no escapes and is vulnerable to gap closers and dives.

**Other**

* [](/draven)

Draven is a weird one to place as he doesn't really have any weak point in the game in terms of damage and he technically has the highest theoretical damage output (though it will never be achieved in game) and a fairly strong lane phase. His early game auto attack will hit very hard so it is best to avoid trading with him early on, however he doesn't have much in terms of burst damage early game so if you have more burst potential abuse it. As high as his damage is he lacks a reliable escape having only a movement speed buff and slow so he is vulnerable to gap closers. In team fights a lot of his damage can be reduced by area denial spells like Ziggs minefield of Viktor's gravity field preventing him from catching his axes and refreshing his AS steroid. He also has 550 range and as such is vulnerable to most AoE damage skills and CC.

* [](/twitch) 

Twitch is a very gimmicky AD relying on stealth for positioning. While his damage output is high he lacks a real escape and has a relativly short range when his ult isn't up making him a risky pick. His ult allows him to do AoE damage with his auto attacks with 850 range so if left alive he has the potential to be a massive threat. However his short normal range and lack of defensive tools leaves him very vulnerable to being bullied and bursted throughout the game. His early game damage is deceptivly high with his passive stacking true damage doing a significant amount of damage early game and expunge hitting very hard in sustained fights. His damage while high takes multiple auto attacks before it picks up meaning he is very vulnerable to bursty lanes especially with his lack of escape tools. Twitch is very reliant on his ult to keep him at a safe distance so try to abuse its long cooldown when you see him use it. He is vulnerable to AoE damage and CC when his ult is not in use.

1339601734.0,81,self.summonerschool,uzxqq,"The Summoner School guide to pro live streams - who to watch, where to watch and why should I watch?",Venturio,92,11,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/uzxqq/the_summoner_school_guide_to_pro_live_streams_who/,"Why hello there. Venturio here to answer one of the more common questions we see around - ""what streams should I watch for x lane?!""

Being an avid stream watcher myself I shall answer in a somewhat general manner, highlighting streams that *I* feel are good to learn from or are entertaining to watch. This isn't a list of who you *have* to watch, but who I enjoy watching when working on getting better. Many of you will disagree, ""omg all dyrus does is sit around and doesn't try n00b"" - you're entitled to your opinion and I am to mine.

Before I get into my favourites list I shall address the question of why you should bother watching streams. Watching pros play can be quite confusing for newer players as they do things that are unseen in low level games. Wards? Don't see many of those around. Watching pros is learning through observation. You can see exactly how long they wait before going for a last hit, where and when they put a ward down, where they ping and what they type in chat. You see their habitual plays in a lane and are likely to attempt them as well if you think they're good habits. You see them make mistakes due to hesitating and will try to hesitate less in a similar situation and so on.

I definitely getting [this extension if you're using Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edidfaijmhpefkbnobdcepampbncgejp) - the LoL Stream browser makes switching streams on the fly easy. :D

I will update this post as other streams become more popular.

Let's begin at the top.

* **Dyrus** || www.twitch.tv/tsm_dyrus || Dyrus is the top-laner for TSM, arguably the best team in the world right now, and the equivalent of a celebrity in League. He's pretty relaxed, normally only plays top lane in high ELO solo queue and plays a large variety of champs. He doesn't always commentate but is good to learn lane tricks and counters from - watch his builds, his wards, his gank sychro with the jungler. 

* **Wingsofdeathx** || www.twitch.tv/wingsofdeath || Wings is the top-laner for the newly formed TSM.evo, a very young, energetic and most of all, powerful team. He made his rise to the top of the streamers by answering all questions people asked him on his stream chat and streamed when all pro players were at IPL4 and didn't steam. He answers a lot of questions, analyses his own mistakes and plays some fun top lane champs like Riven.

* **Wickd** || www.own3d.tv/live/18755 || Wickd is my favourite top laner, playing on the EUW Servers for team CLG.eu, one of the biggest of Europe right now right alongside M5. Wickd has excellent top-lane mechanics, teaches you how to trade, how to freeze a lane, how to make the most out of a lane you are winning or losing, how to play against bad match ups, how to last hit well and how to stay positive at all times. His Irelia play is legendary as she's his favourite champ, but he can play pretty much anyone and do very well.

---

Let's move onto the mid lane.

* **Scarra.** || www.twitch.tv/scarra || Scarra is the AP mid player for Team Dignitas and is very popular among the community for having reached #1 on the NA Solo Queue Ranked ladder and answering a lot of questions on his live stream as well regarding AP mids. He never rages, is always relaxed and chill as well as friendly and is a superb midlane player. If you want to learn to play the mages in mid, watch this fun streamer.

* **Bigfatlp (jiji)** || www.own3d.tv/live/13576 || The AP mid for CLG.na, with a fetish for cats (he posts vlogs featuring his cats only). Jiji doesn't really talk much but is mechanically very strong in mid. He shows how to be mapaware and how to outplay your opponent regardless of match up making some wonderful clutch plays. Watching him stream is more reliant on your own ability to see what he did and why he did it - don't rely on him to make any explanations.

* **Froggen** || www.own3d.tv/live/112348 || ""Froggenivia"" is a popular AP mid player for his ability to absolutely decimate enemy teams using Anivia, one of the harder champs to master in the game, building just about whatever items tickles his fancy. Warmogs and Mejais? No problem, get 16 kills anyway. Froggen answers a lot of questions on his IRC channel but doesn't talk much - instead he makes up for it with good music. So if you have any specific questions, don't hesitate to jump onto IRC and send him a private message.

* **Ocelote** || www.own3d.tv/live/2721 || Ocelote is the team leader of SK Gaming's LoL team and is a magnificent midlaner from Europe as well. Recently there's been a lane swap with him and one his team mates, so currently Ocelote appears to be playing top lane competitively, but on his stream right now, he is playing in mid. He's very informative, answers questions as well and likes to discuss champion choices and justifies his plays, even if they go wrong.

---

I don't really watch many streams for the bot lane, but there are a few decent ones... I only really watch two for support play, so if anyone's got a good stream that teaches support, do tell.

* **Aphromoo** || www.twitch.tv/aphromoo || Aphromoo is one of the most entertaining streamers I've had the pleasure of watching. Member of the recently formed TSM.evo as their AD Carry, this man knows how to play AD well. He duo-queues with Nhat Nguyen a lot and constantly jokes around while still playing incredibly well. Listening to him makes me laugh frequently, but he also answers questions regarding AD carries, often regarding item choices, counter picks and ideal supports.

* **Nhat Nguyen** || www.twitch.tv/nhatn || Nhat is a team member to Aphromoo and Wingsofdeathx and is a support player with a great reputation. His Blitzcrank is deadly and he's a pleasure to watch with his constant duo play featuring Aphoromoo. He plays all supports, ranging from Soraka to Leona. You'll often see him carry two stacks of wards throwing them around like a Phreak throws around tons of damage. Definitely a great player to watch if you want to learn how to support your team mates.

* **Krepo** || www.own3d.tv/live/194947 || 'Skumbag Krepo' is the support player of the well known team CLG.eu. There's not much I can say about him except for him also being an exceptional support who always takes his supporting seriously. During CLG.eu team practise you'll often see Snoopeh and Wickd fooling around and it comes down to Krepo to get them back in line to prevent them from throwing the game.

* **Nientonsoh** || www.twitch.tv/nientonsoh || Nien was recently picked up by Orbit gaming and is known around the pros as an AD carry who has reached the very top of the NA Ranked Solo Queue ladder - often seen around the top 10. His mechanics are insanely good, you'll never see this man out of position. A great stream to watch if you've already got the AD basics down but need to learn how to position yourself in a big fight as the champ who deals the most consistent damage throughout the game.

---

Onto the jungle. Jungling is the most flexible and arguably the most influential role in a match, capable of snowballing and controlling all  the lanes and objectives. If you wish to carry your team mates, learn to jungle well and be forever loved (and irrationally hated).

* **TheOddOne** || www.twitch.tv/tsm_theoddone || TheOddOne is the jungler for TeamSoloMid, TSM for short, and a team mate to the previously mentioned Dyrus. He is one of the best junglers in North America at the moment with a wide variety of champions, unafraid to play junglers considered ""weaker"" at the moment, or not ""top-tier."" Very educational as he is able to somewhat objectively assess his own as well as his team's mistakes and what should have been done differently. Great for learning jungle routes, jungle wards, counter jungling and especially how to gank.

* **Saintvicious** || www.twitch.tv/crs_saintvicious || Saintvicious was recently picked up by Curse Gaming and is the former jungler of CLG.na. Saint, like TheOddOne, is a very strong jungler who is very entertaining to watch. His occasional solo-queue-related rage and hilarious moments in the jungle make him both very informative and entertaining to watch.

* **HotshotGG** || www.own3d.tv/live/13574 || HotshotGG is the former top lane player of the fabled CLG.na, who has recently taken the role of jungler in the team. This means that Hotshot doesn't have the experience of many other pro junglers out there and is still learning quite a few things - great to watch if you want to see a few more uncommon junglers (Chogath, Trundle) and see how a pro learns a new role.

* **Snoopeh** || www.own3d.tv/live/112350 || Snoopeh is the jungler of CLG.eu and is also very fun to watch. Snoopeh likes to play heavy CC, tanky junglers with fun ganks and is a great European streamer to watch if you want to learn how to gank a lot, including the mean lane-gank. His accent is great and he's quite informative.

* **Malunoo** || www.own3d.tv/live/135706 || Malunoo is the jungler of Curse.eu and is one of the lesser-watched streamers. Due to this, Malunoo interacts with his fans a lot and answers pretty much every question, most of them on-stream. When he's waiting in queue for a match, he'll play epic oldschool gameboy games on an emulator. He duo queues a lot with Wickd in their ever strong Jungler/Top combo with very well coordinated ganks, carrying the toplaner to a higher elo on smurf accounts.

---

That's all I really can think off of the top of my head. I'll probably add a few more here and there. Most of these streamers are from CLG, TSM and Curse, and are all successful professional players from both EU and NA timezones. I would definitely check some of them out if I were you and wanted to learn how the big names play their chosen lanes or jungles. If you have any stream recommendations or comments, leave them below!

Got to remember that."" Sure enough, he shot his next arrow above her, and she walked straight in to it. He walks in to the bush, gets close, then flashes out to land his ult, but Ashe flashes back to dodge it. She's really low but back behind her tower, so he fully charges a piercing arrow and lets it rip. I see that he's missed it, but Ashe does the work for him: she runs straight up and takes it to the face, and the kill pops up. ""Told you she goes up!"" he says.

1370349795.0,84,self.summonerschool,1fncai,It took forever.. but I made gold early this morning!,zebano,92,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fncai/it_took_forever_but_i_made_gold_early_this_morning/,"Thanks for all the tips on this subreddit, in particular the links to [LoL  mechanics 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ywhB-2h2AE&amp;feature=em-subs_digest) on youtube which has great tips on trading! I may have mained ADC but I played my share of Supp, Jungle and Mid as well. 

My random tips...

1. If you're playing a poor pusher like Ryze be sure to tell your team ahead of time to pay attention to mia calls. Follow if you know which way they went but otherwise shove your lane (R is on really short CD, and I like maxing E second). 

2. Know when your champ is strong. Mid I basically only play Ryze and I know I get blown up by Brand's combo until I get MR +HP (either of Spirit Visage or Banshee's are solid choices) so I just farm at tower.

3. In chess you can plan to play a scholars mate but if your game starts 1. e4 d5  (center counter) you need to adjust because they will almost certainly play d6 and your preplanned attack on f7 falls apart. LoL is all about adaption, it's nice to say I'm going to get smiteless blue, take red and gank top but if you're heading past wraiths and Lee Sin ganks mid you better get out there and save your midlaner if you can. Going back to number 2 you also have to know which lanes you can gank both due to wards and due to having a chance for success. I had a monkey against Darius last game who wanted me to camp but I had better luck ganking mid and bottom and a few times when I was close I was low enough that auto-Q-Execute would cause me to bleed out so I didn't gank.

4. As an ADC or Supp you need to chat ahead of time about how much chasing you're willing to do. I do not like engaging when there is a 9+ minion wave pushing against me at early levels. Auto-e disengage as Trist or I simply eat too much damage from minions. Many supports who play Taric or Leona will chase anywhere and go Look I stunned no jump in here! and there's no reason to play so risky (unless it's a sure win) when I have 200+ gold sitting there in a wave. 

5. If you can take a tower there is often little reason to try and kill the guy hanging around behind the tower. Get the objectives, kills are a bonus (YMMV).

6. As a jungler getting your mid to roam with you is the best way to ensure successful ganks followed by taking a tower. 

7. Pink wards are OP. If you play support and don't buy lots of pink wards you're doing it wrong. Vision denial is amazingly strong and will make your jungler love you. They also love it if you tell them river is warded but tri isn't or River ward expires at 5:45.

8. mute the ragers and rally what troops you can. LoL is a team game and you need a team to win.

9. Don't counterpick if you don't play the champion! I basically play Trist, Nami, Ali, Ryze, Sejuani with a small helping of Cho, Varus, Amumu, Xin and Swain when they're called for. Xin is played only when my top laner/Supp provides CC/initiation, Swain is only played against Akali, Cho is played when I'm forced to top, Varus is only played against Draven, Amumu is played when someone takes him because he wasn't banned and Ali is taken over Nami if I don't think Jungle/top provides enough CC / tankyness.

It was refreshing to try out champs I usually never play, and never feeling guilty if I wasn't playing to perfection. I was experimenting with builds, and implementing different strategies to push and win. The last few evenings I noticed a drastic different play experience. Its become full of pissed off serious people. I was wondering if anyone else has felt this way? I have gotten chewed out several matches for ""not"" building a certain way. 
Example: Even when having a counterpart on the other team that I was out performing, double their kills, less than half their deaths and triple their assists I was told ""Be like their Cait"". I felt I had a better build but yet this person would not shut up. I picked up  Shurelya's Reverie because we kept pushing then having to fall back before we got slaughtered. Which seemed to be happening a lot. I thought the item would help us retreat and it did. This is when all hell broke loose and the said player went berzerk on me, screaming ""Report Cait"" in /all and chewing me out. He somehow got the rest of the team onboard and I was massively reported at the end of the match. (loss) And it somehow ended up all my fault. 

These kinds of matches have been happening more, and I am scared to think outside the standard builds. I have a huge ignore list and find myself lately infuriated by the amount of hate and blame directed at me when I don't do as I am told or else. 

Has anyone noticed a decline in ARAM the past few days or am I the harbinger of bad luck? Am I wrong in having fun and trying new things in this mode?

1339363551.0,83,self.summonerschool,uv3pz,How to de-escalate an unreasonable player.,RobotRumpShaker,98,15,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/uv3pz/how_to_deescalate_an_unreasonable_player/,"Hello internet,

I work in public schools for a living.  Many of the children I work with are fucking crazy, and exhibit behaviors/deficits similar to those found in many League of Legends players.  You know what I'm talking about (solo queue anyone?).

After a long period of rage quitting, cursing, muting and getting banned from the game, I decided to return with a different approach.  So far, it's been about 90% effective in de-escalating unreasonable players who decide to fly off the handle when things don't go their way.  If your other team members fly off the handle, there may not be much you can do.  Also, its not going to make a terrible player a super star.  What it will do is take that angry, crazy little 8 year old controlling Master Yi via the internet and get him/her(?) under control.

Basically, you want to shoot for three things:

1. Communication - If he/she doesn't talk, there's probably no point in expecting anything from them.

2. Inclusion - Even though they are being unreasonable, make sure you emphasize that they are part of the team and have vital roles to fill.  You also may have to tell other players to calm down if they are raging against the unreasonable player.  The most isolated that player is, the less they will care about they game.

3. Momentum - Once things start to take a turn for the better, do what you can to move things along.  Be a big team player.  Call mias, praise kills and make a joke or something.  If you begin to de-escalate a situation, you have to make sure to keep the momentum going so that the team can move on.

I'm going to list some common situations, and will add more to the main post if people want to contribute.  I will refer to the unreasonable player as Master Yi, as chances are the unreasonable player in your party is playing Master Yi (or Ziggs).  These responses are not guaranteed to work, but just might do something to at least make the duration of your crushing defeat more pleasant.  

When you come across somebody who won't have any of what you're saying, don't talk to them any more.  If the behavior continues, provide a single warning that you will mute and report them after the game.  If things don't improve, follow through.  Your worries are over, and you can have a big sigh of relief knowing that you did everything that a man on the internet told you that you could do.

* Player refuses to go to their lane
These players just say no over and over in response to anything you say.  They may also just sit in a lane that they don't belong in hoping to force the other player out.  

Robot responses:

1. Master Yi, we really need you to go to your lane.  Can you please get over there as soon as possible?

2. Master Yi, PLAYER NAME called top/mid at the start of the game.  Please get to your lane as soon as you can.

If they comply, thank them and keep the momentum going. Be that team player and help the team move on.

* Player begins badmouthing teammates.
This one gets progressively more difficult to de-escalate as the game goes on.  People love to talk about other players' builds and purchases.  Sometimes, they like to blame things on others and start messing up the vibe.

Robot Responses:

1. Master Yi, those comments really don't help anything.  Focus on the game so we can win.

2. Master Yi, Ziggs is playing the game how he wants to play it. Mind your own business.

If the reason for the raging is a struggling player, see if you can help somehow.  Maybe rotate him to a different position or go support him in his lane.  Some people do actually respond well to suggestions, and many bad players that struggle through games are quiet because asking for help is a very anxiety-inducing action that has very mixed results.

* Teammates aren't listening/ruining everything! They pick champions/make decisions that don't make sense!

In the lower ranks, any combination of champions has the potential to steamroll the other team. People you play with/against will progressively have a better understanding of the game as you level your account. You may have noticed this already if you've played games without a jungler (which happens a lot in lower level draft and random games). HANG ON KITTEN! It gets better. ;_;


1. If teammates aren't responding to your suggestions or seem like they might not want to communicate in a productive way, warn/ignore/mute. No point in beating a dead horse.


2. Keep your tips/suggestions as positive as possible. Don't say that they're making mistakes or that what they have in mind is a bad idea. Be as clear and specific as you can to better sell your advice without insulting the customer (so to speak). Make it positive! Try ""You could get more kills if"" or ""They won't see you if you go here"" or ""You'll get more exp over here."" The goal is to facilitate communication between you and the other player, so you may need to dumb it down so that he/she gets where you're coming from.

There are several Poro on the Howling Abyss, but only 2 of them can be interacted with. They are found here:
http://imgur.com/xwlwwnm

**Poro Behavior**

The poro is a shy and fluffy creature, and will run away from Champion, be he a Yordle, Ionian, Noxian,... on sight. Entering the bush will trigger the Poro escape mechanism and will make him run away. This will lead to him exiting the bush, and making himself visible to the opposing team. This way, they know that at least 1 enemy is in that bush. http://imgur.com/IjdKZ0F

**Poro Diet**

The Poro has a hard time finding edible food in this icy region, making it fall in love with everyone that has something worth eating on him. This is why the Poro-Snax were invented. These treats contain everything the Poro needs, and they can give the summoner a small edge in combat as well. If you are the first person on your team to enter the bush, AND you have a Poro-Snax with you, the Poro will not run away! In fact, it will run towards you. This allows for an entirely invisible brush-entry. If you are satisfied with the location of the poro, you can feed him the treat, which will make some hearts pop over his head showing his affection. This will last for about a second, after which he will behave as normal again, running away from everyone. http://imgur.com/76yXW1o 

The Poro can also be tricked into running the opposite direction if you were lucky enough to snag a champion with a gapcloser. Just dash behind the Poro and he should promptly run to your side of the map, making the enemy unaware of your entry. A couple of example of this would be Zed's W, Fizz's E and Jarvan's E + Q combo.

**Miscellaneous Poro Information**

* Poro's can be marked with the Ping tool.
* They can be herded into the fountain turret for 4 gold (needs confirmation).
* Nunu and Cho'Gath can't Consume or Feast them.
* Syndra can not pick them up.

**TL;DR**

Poro's will give away your position at the start of the game if you aren't careful with them.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1fz7k4,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fz7k4/how_poros_can_help_you/,
1370133744.0,80,self.summonerschool,1fhs35,Up From EloHell: How to carrry your noob feeder team,BlueNoseReindeer,99,19,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fhs35/up_from_elohell_how_to_carrry_your_noob_feeder/,"For those of you who haven't been on the internet very long, the title is meant to be more than a little sarcastic :p

A bit more seriously, I went from Silver 4 to Platinum  so far this season, learning a lot along the way, and would like to share some of those things.


* 1. Attitude is the most important thing. I like to keep track of helpful posts I find on this reddit about improving as a player, but one of the things that I never see mentioned is attitude. Personally, this was the most important factor in achieving the success that I have so far. Learning to be positive in toxicly negative situations, as well as humble in ""Freelo"" games is a necessary element in making comebacks/not throwing. What's more, **if you ever want to get out of ""EloHell,"" you can't believe that it exists**.

For example, I am a support main, but one game where I was jungling the other team went for a late invade. Long story short, I found myself starting off the game with 2 deaths, no flash, and no blue buff as Nautilus, with a Fiora as our top laner (not someone I expect much from). Every single lane was losing early, and we started off 0-6, with everyone being behind level and cs. However, we kept calm, and waited for them to make a mistake. Sure enough, they 2-man dived Fiora top while I was waiting in the wings, giving us 2 kills for none. We eventually came back to win. The mentality you need to have in the games where all hope is lost is that **everyone is a noob if you let them be one, and every team will throw given the chance**. People with giant leads want to make giant plays, which leads them to make foolish decisions, learning how to bait out towerdives, chases, etc. is how you can make your team relevant again in ""blowout"" games.

On the other hand, I had a game as Morg mid where we got 5 kills, multiple flashes, and blue on the invade, leading us on to a 9-0 + dragon start. We got cocky, and threw hard (fortunately they threw back, and we won in 50 minutes). I've lost games where we were up 17-1 with 5 towers and 2 dragons because of one simple rule: **good items can't replace good play**. When you get a giant lead it becomes tempting to mess around, get lots of kills, max out your build, and get a crazy good KDA. The problem with this mindset is that it doesn't take into account any part of the enemy team. **Throwing starts when you only take into account what you can do, ignoring what your enemy can do, and ends when you think only about what they can do, not what you can do** (e.g. ""gg vayne fed, nice throw cait"").

As a last note on this subject, don't EVER argue with teammates during the game- it negatively impacts your performance, their performance, and the performance of everyone on your team who has to listen (and if you do it in all chat, it will boost the morale of the enemy team. Don't think so? What's your reaction when you see the other team flaming each other in allchat?). Trying to tell people how to play generally isn't a good idea either, unless they are asking for help even the best advice will usually be taken the wrong way. **Solo Queue is where you improve yourself, not the random people you get paired with, energy that you use to think about their mistakes (whether you bring them up or not) is energy that you aren't using to think about your mistakes.** That being said, sometimes criticism (usually not the constructive kind either) from your teammates can help you see what you're doing wrong (and sometimes they're completely off their rocker). If you can use the criticism they give you productively, instead of getting mad over it, you will do well in Solo Queue. I go into matches assuming that my team is going to be disagreeable (until they prove otherwise, sometimes they do this as soon as champ select), and take every caution to be polite and helpful, and trust me, it makes a huge difference, both in learning from my mistakes and creating a more cooperative team.

It may not be something you feel like putting effort into, but **if you want something you've never had, you have to do things you've never done**- changing the attitude that you bring to the game is one of those things.


* 2. Study the game, don't just play it. This is the 21st century, and information is everywhere. Keeping up with the curve means you need to learn from others, not just your own experiences. Streams, wikis, advice videos, guides, reddit, lolking, and other resources (too numerable to mention) are essential to understanding the game; figure out what works for *you,* and always be on the lookout for more sources. What's more, I highly suggest keeping a list of resources you find particularly helpful (i.e. instead of liking an article and telling yourself you'll remember it, copy the link into a word doc (with a couple words to remind yourself what it's about) and keep a library of these resources  to remind yourself about the important ideas from them, and easy access should you want to re-examine them.

Big streamers are big for a reason (usually because they are on a team), and they are a good place to start watching high level play. However, my favorite streamers are guys who generally have small audiences. Take the time to look through the Twitch listing all/most of the way, and try out smaller guys sometimes. You will find some you like, and some you don't, but one very nice thing about all streamers with small audiences (that I've seen) is that you can ask any/all questions you have and expect an answer. One streamer I like that generally has &lt;100 viewers even asks his audience for questions so that he can kill time between ques!

Never latch on to any strategy/build/item/champion/comp etc. as something definite. People are always learning more about both the game and the current meta, and Riot is constantly updating their game. **What is true today may be false tomorrow.** League is a game about adaptation, and if you want to succeed at it you must always be ready to change.

Make it your goal to always be learning something new about the game. For example, every week make yourself play a game or two with a champion you've never played before so that you understand how they work, or find a video about tips &amp; tricks, successful strategies, or a high level game that you notice something in. **The key here is making a goal that you can stick to, and achieving it in a way that is still *enjoyable*.** Believe it or not, learning is something humans naturally enjoy, it's just  the way we go about it that sometimes makes the process unenjoyable. League should be something you enjoy doing, if it isn't, getting to the point where you can enjoy it is your first step on the road to success (see ""Stizza Conv"" on my facebook/twitter).

* 3. Take risks. Don't try to make plays that you know have little to no chance of success, there is almost always a better alternative, and you don't really learn anything from the experience. Trying things you've never done before, and making decisions that help the rest of the team but challenge you personally are the type of risks you want to take. Why? Because these are the types of risks that will help you learn. If you ""can't carry hard enough"" for your ""noob feeder team,"" wouldn't you like to learn more so that you can? You can't change the types of teams you get, but you can change your performance and behavior, so focus on those.

Diving into the entire enemy team at baron pit while its till at half health is not a risk, it's suicide. Letting someone lower on the pick order take your mid even after the Kat who did last game went 1/8/0 is. Taking Baron without any form of vision control (oracles/pinks or greens surrounding) is not a risk, it's being lazy. Wait until baron gets below 2k to try to steal it, or let the support ward around before starting baron. If they don't have wards, have them stand in the river bush as a lookout. Learn the difference between making a decision hastily (foolish) and hesitating to follow a decision (also foolish), disciplining yourself to make good decisions and not hesitate to follow them is a skill that every player regardless of rank needs to work on. 

There isn't much I can talk about specifically in this area, risk-taking is just something you have to practice. When you practice it, **expect to fail hard and fail a lot**. Odds are you will, and if you don't then you have something to be happy about. **The reason why risk taking is worth it in the long run is because it gets you *doing* more: thinking more, learning more, firing brain cells more.** It puts you in new situations that make you do unexpected things, which may not be successful themselves, but allow you to learn more which helps you succeed in the long run.

I could talk more about stuff that I've learned that I think is important, and if you guys like this I may, but this is pretty honkin long and I'm tired of writing for the moment.

To **clarify** on the point of this guide:

I'm writing this guide to help out any fellow summoner who either has trouble with the role of jungler, anyone who wants to improve his/her jungling skills, anybody who is just willing to read to learn more, or anyone that just wishes to get better overall by understanding the role of a jungler. I hope you all enjoy this guide as much as I had fun writing it! I will now explain, to the best of my knowledge, the fundamentals of the Jungler.

**Jungling - The Fundementals**

**Your role in a 5v5 composition as a Jungler**

Your role, responsibilities, and key concepts as a Jungler is:

 * To farm for CS, Gold, and levels within your jungle or the enemy's jungle so that you can let Top Lane be a solo lane, i.e. more EXP, Gold, and CS given to your top laner

 * Gank lanes in order to help that specific lane ""snowball"" ahead of his/her enemy laner. 

 * To keep an eye out for enemy ""mias, "" enemy buff spawns, Baron timers, Dragon timers, where the enemy jungler is, etc. 

 * To ""cover"" lanes if a teammate dies, goes back to Base to buy, is afk, goes to gank another lane, etc. 

 * To have good decision making! e.g. Don't tower dive when you have the slightest hint that your teammates can't follow up on your dive.

 * **Most important!** Your #1 responsibility is **to be in the right place, at the right time!** That means **positioning!** e.g. If  the enemy Bot Lane is just ""asking"" for a gank, i.e. they are really low in HP and are making your Bot Lane tower hug, do not go to farm wolves, get in position and gank them. This one key concept is what separates the ""good"" junglers from the ""bad."" Remember this, for it is key to success as the jungler. Although, I'm not saying that is all you need to know, for knowledge on the game's mechanics helps greatly, especially with your decision making, i.e. you jungle ""playstyle"" may be similar to that of how you are supposed to play a certain champion but if you can't position yourself well in teamfights, for objectives, focusing important enemies (AP or AD Carry), counter-ganks, etc., you're not playing to your full potential as the Jungler. 

**Jungle Routes**

 * Remember to ask for help at Wolves or Wraiths when you start, but make sure they are not close to you when you kill them, for they might get the EXP that you need.

 * Also ask for a ""pull/leash"" on whatever Buff you start at, it helps your with your jungle clearing speed, allowing for you to get in position earlier for ganks. Don't worry about your teammates missing out on CS during the ""leash,"" if you guys pull off the leashing well, then your teammate shouldn't miss any CS or maybe just 1.

There are two general routes you can take, these are:

*Mana Dependant* - Wolves &gt; Golem Blue buff &gt; Wraiths &gt; Double Golems &gt; Lizard Red buff

 * Taking this path allows you to finish at the Lizard buff, note that by this time, both Wolves and Wraiths will be up again, so you may go jungle more, OR if you spot a ganking opportunity, you may go for that as well, for, after you finish Lizard buff you have access to, depending on which side you're on, if Blue Side, then quick access to Bot Lane, if Purple Side, quick access to Top Lane, keep that in mind. This is only IF you're ""healthy"" enough for a gank.

*Non-Mana Dependant* - Wraiths &gt; Lizard Red buff &gt; Double Golems &gt; Wolves &gt; Golem Blue buff

 * Taking this path allows you to finish at Golem buff OR, since you're manaless, you may give it to your Mid Laner, giving him/her the upper hand during early game. Remember that by this time, both Wolves and Wraiths will be up again, so you may go jungle more, OR if you spot a ganking opportunity, you may go for that as well. You're close to Top Lane if you're on Blue Side and close to Bot Lane if you're on Purple Side. This is only IF you're ""healthy"" enough for a gank.

**When/How to gank as a Jungler** 

**The How**

 * Ask your teammate, depending on which lane you're gong to gank, whether or not anything is warded.

 * If something is warded, yet you still want/need to gank that lane, then considered whether or not it would be worth it to take a ""longer"" route around the ward to gank or to go attempt a gank at a later more opportune time. 

 * If a bush isn't warded, you may take advantage of it and wait in it to ""ambush"" the enemy laner. 

 * When ""waiting for the right time"" to initiate the gank, look for opportunities like: (These only apply IF: your teammate is in position to respond to this gank or if you're positive on your DMG output to secure the kill on your own) When the enemy laner uses his only form of escape or CC, i.e. Twisted Fate just used his ""Pick a Card,"" Katarina just used ""Shunpo,"" Ezreal just used ""Arcane Shift,"" etc., the enemy laner is overextending greatly, or if the enemy laner is extremely low and is hugging his/her tower (generally applies for ""behind the tower"" ganks)

 * Learn to save your dashes/blinks/escapes, if your enemy laner decides to use his/her blinks/dashes/escapes or Flash to get away, so that you're able to get to them if they happen to do so, also you may not even need to use them if the gank is executed correctly, and may just perform a successful gank with just the Slow from Red Buff. 

 * Learn to focus the more important targets first, i.e. the ADC in Bot Lane, rather than the 100 HP Sona, for you'd want to rather ""Shutdown"" the ADC early on so you may help your Bot Lane ""snowball"" ahead, than get a kill on the 0/3/2 Support and let the 3/0/0 ADC get away.

 * Be extremely map aware! It's partly your responsibility to ward or at least be aware of ALL areas, including the ones that should be warded/watched by your teammate, they'll be very appreciative of it too if you help out his/her lane with the warding. Warding provides you with vision of what is happening in a certain area, meaning that could open up possible gank opportunities. 

**The When**

Knowing how to gank is one thing, but learning **when** to gank is even more important.

 * Know the position of your enemy jungler so that an opportunity for a gank can form, e.g. if your Top Lane needs help and is just asking for a gank, and the enemy jungler shows Bot Lane AND you know your Bot Lane should be fairly safe, this opens up a gank opportunity for you to gank Top Lane w/o fear of a counter-gank.

 * Only gank if you're fairly positive you won't get killed or get a teammate killed, unless it is considered a ""good"" trade, e.g. the enemy ADC for your Support. 

 * Only gank if you're ""healthy"" enough for a gank, which doesn't necessarily mean you have to be ""healthy"" enough for a kill, but just have enough HP in general in case of counter-ganks, etc.

 * When the enemy laner is pushed your teammate out of lane and is attempting to take out the tower. 

 * When the enemy laner has no wards placed down, or HP pots, Flask, etc., e.g. Lacks sustain and/or vision.

 * When the enemy laner uses his/her only for of CC or escape, i.e. Annie's stun, TF's Gold Card, Caitlyn's Net, etc.

 * Even if the enemy hasn't used his/her CC ability or for of escape, you can initiate the gank if he/she uses any form of one of his/her's main abilities (knowing the enemy champion's mechanics, i.e. ability CDs, etc., will really help here) this may include: Riven's Broken Wings, Katarina's Bouncing Blades, Nidalee's Spear, etc. 

 * When the you ""spot"" an enemy ""out of position"" so that you may ""catch"" him/her, kill him/her, and then force a 5v4, if necessary.

 * Try to only gank when your teammate is aware of your incoming gank, this means Pings, In-chat communication, etc. AND be sure he's in a good position to gank, i.e. isn't OOM, low on HP, has no Flash (situational), etc.

**There are probably many, many more tips that I missed so if anyone of you guys noticed, please help me and the rest of the community by placing it in the comments below, thank you!**

**The Difference between a ""Successful"" gank and a ""Bad"" gank**

The main differences between a ""Bad"" gank and a ""Successful"" gank include:

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if you ""burn"" the enemy's Flash w/o using your own or having your teammate use his/her own. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to get the kill, but, for example, say having your Mid Laner have a Flash while the enemy Mid Laner doesn't have his/her's can be a big factor on who will eventually ""win"" the lane and ""snowball"" ahead. 

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if you ""trade"" well in terms of kills, i.e. the enemy ADC for your Support, DMG output, i.e. forcing the enemy support or ADC to go back to Base to heal or ""hug"" the tower. 

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if you or your teammate gets a kill out of the gank w/o dying.

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if your teammate is are forced to ""hug"" the turret and you make the enemy laner back-off through a potential kill, presence, etc., thusly relieving pressure on that lane for your teammate. 

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" counter-gank if you happen to kill either the enemy Jungler or ADC, and (sometimes just as important) the enemy Support. 

 * It is considered a ""Bad"" gank if you happen to die or, even worse, make one of your teammates die. This could be due to, underestimating the potential DMG output of the enemy laner, overestimating your potential DMG output, making bad plays, not having your teammates be ""healthy"" enough for the gank, not knowing the position of the enemy jungle in case of a counter gank, diving underneath the enemy turret w/o any follow-up, i.e. making bad calls, not communicating with your teammates well enough, and etc. 

As you can see, from reading, Ganking, the When and How, is really all boiled down to knowing the game's mechanics, whether that be DMG output, Builds, ability CDs, etc., and the most important, **decision making,** it is your responsibility, and of course your other teammates, but more you really, to make the right ""calls"" at the right time. Always, always be thinking ahead, i.e. ""What's next after Dragon?,"" ""Gank Top or Bot or Counter Jungle?,"" 'Take Mid Inhibitor then Baron?,"" remember it's **your** call! You, as the Jungler, can dictate the **""flow""** of the game through your decisions, e.g. ""I want our Bot Lane ADC to snowball ahead with a score of 10/0/5,"" as the Jungler, **you** can make that happen! If you feel like carrying, yourself, you can make that happen too! Make the right calls! Think ahead and make it happen!

**Counter Jungling**

Counter Jungling is essentially the idea that you, as the Jungler, sometimes the other roles as well, go into the enemy jungle to ""steal"" enemy camps, buffs, etc., allowing you to get ahead in terms of CS, Gold, and levels, while making the enemy Jungler get behind in those crucial things as well. 

 * You can counter jungle if you're ""healthy"" enough to do so to take the enemy camps w/o dying and enough HP to survive if you're ""caught"" in the enemy jungle.

 * It is safer to counter jungler when you know the position of your the enemy jungler and the position of the enemy laner closest to the side of he enemy jungle that you're in.

 * This ""safety net"" can be obtained by warding the enemy jungle, also warding the enemy buffs opens up opportunities to smite steal them, which on a psychological level, frustrates the enemy Jungler to no end, despairing him/her, pushing him.her farther behind. 

 * Learn the timings on all Junglers so that you know when, e.g., a Lee Sin will be at Blue Buff, so that you may potentially ""catch"" him/her her while on low HP, get the kill, and take the buff or even give it to a teammate. 

**Applying Pressure as a Jungler**

As the Jungler, there are four basic ways of applying pressure as the Jungler, aside from actually executing a successful gank, these include: (if I miss any, let me know in the comments please!)

 * *Presence* - Just walking into one of your teammate's lane, making careful measurements to not ""steal"" his/her EXP, Gold, and/or CS away, will ""pressure"" the enemy laner and make him/her back off and start playing ""safely,"" or might even prevent him/her from CSing at all, due to fear. Sometimes, you don't even have to walk into the lane itself, if there is an enemy ward about, and you have an Oracles Elixir, you can just clear it to make enemy laner think you're ""there.""

 * *Counter-Jungling* - By counter jungling the enemy Jungler, not only are you pushing him/her behind but you're potentially ""snowballing"" yourself ahead, especially if you happen to kill the enemy Jungler when he/she's in his/her own jungle, thusly making the enemy laners more cautious and wary for your ganks since they can't rely on his/her Jungler as much due to him being behind having to stay in the jungle longer.

 * *Killing Wards* - Making the enemy team ""blind"" is a scary and very worrying thing, so with you clearing enemy wards throughout the map, thanks to an Oracles or Pink Ward, you'll be forcing the enemy team to make ""blind"" decisions. This, in turn, can open up many opportunities like ""forcing"" fights at Dragon or Baron, ""catching"" enemy players that are trying to ward out of position, prevent roaming from enemy laners, thus relieving pressure on your team's lanes, etc. 

 * *Behind/Under the enemy Tower ganks* - This applies massive pressure on the enemy laner! It let's him/her and the rest of the enemy team know that you're skilled enough to know how to execute these well and are not afraid to, if need be, thusly applying pressure to all the enemy lanes. This one is fairly hard to execute properly, early game-early mid game that is, sometimes late game, for it requires an exact calculation of your DMG output, your teammates DMG output, you and your teammate's HP, the enemy's HP, items, resistances, etc., tower-aggro, minion-aggro, enemy counter-gank ""clean ups,"" etc. Gank with caution. 

**Invading vs. Defending**

At the beginning of the game, you have two choices to make, regarding your and your enemy's jungle, ""Should I Invade to ""steal"" buffs with my team early on or should I Defend my own jungle?"" These choices are:

*Invading* - When you ""invade"" the enemy jungle, i.e. going into the enemy jungle **with** your team to ""steal"" Camps, so that you get ""ahead"" early on, you will, if you meet at least one of these criteria:

 * Your team composition is much stronger at LVL 1 than the enemy's team composition, e.g. the enemy team is extremely squishy, lacks escapes (aside from Flash), your team has more DMG potential at LVL 1 or are tankier, etc. 

 * You have Blitzcrank to ""grab"" someone for First Blood.

 * You or someone of your team has snares, roots, binds, taunts, etc. AND the enemy team doesn't (sometimes). 

 * You're Syndra and are able to ""pull"" away the Blue Buff or Red Buff over the wall, ""stealing"" it.

*Defending* - When you ""defend"" your jungle from potential enemy ""invasions"" due to:

 * The enemy composition is much stronger at LVL 1 than the your team's composition, e.g. the your team is extremely squishy, lacks escapes (aside from Flash), the enemy team has more DMG potential at LVL 1 or are tankier, etc. 

 * The enemy team has Blitzcrank to ""grab"" someone for First Blood. (Be very, very cautious)

 * Someone of the enemy team has snares, roots, binds, taunts, etc. AND the your team doesn't (sometimes). 

 * The enemy team has Syndra and are able to ""pull"" away the Blue Buff or Red Buff over the wall, ""stealing"" it.

 * If you want to just play it ""safe"" and not risk anything.

**Objectives - Towers, Golems, Lizards, Dragon, and Baron** 

(Will later be adding the significance of these objectives to achieve Victory, when to go for these objectives and when not to go for them, etc.)

 * *Towers* - When one tower is taken down, it grants everyone on your team 150 gold, being a total of 750 gold, a bit over the gold received from a kill, (not factoring in Bounty)

 * *Golems* - Gives 82 total gold from killing the enter Golem buff camp, gives you a buff that grants you temporary 20 % CDR, and your ManaReg increases by 1% per % of Mana missing.
Transfers to the player who kills the buff owner. Lasts for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Spawns every 5 minutes prior to being slain.

 * *Lizards* - Gives 81 total gold from killing the entire Lizard buff camp, gives you a buff that applies a slow on anyone that you AA, and causes him/her to ""burn"" dealing a DoT (Damage over Time). Transfers to the the player who kills the buff owner. Lasts for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Spawns every 5 minutes prior to being slain.

 * *Dragon* - When slain, gives the entire team 190 gold, being a total of 950 gold.  Spawns every 6 minutes prior to it being slain.

 * *Baron* -  When slain, gives the entire team 300 each, being a total of 1500 gold. Gives the entire slaying team a buff which gives massively increased AD and AP as well as a bonus to HealthReg and ManaReg. Spawns every 7 minutes prior to it being slain. 

**What champions can be played as Jungler**

 * *The Godlike Gankers* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) may include Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, Rammus, etc., and are classified by his/her amazing ganking potential thanks to his/her kit which generally includes some form of gap closer, a hard CC, and are fairly tanky enough to dive under turrets for kills. 

 * *The Counter Junglers* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) may include Nunu, Warwick, Shyvana, Vi, etc., and are characterized by his/her counter jungling potential thanks to his/her kit allowing to safely and quickly ""steal"" enemy camps, and are able to duel 1v1, and win, if you happen to ""catch"" the enemy Jungler jungling. 

 * *The Global Presence Junglers* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) may include Karthus, Shen, Gangplank, etc., and are characterized by his/her ability to apply global pressure to all lanes, thanks to his/her kit (generally Ultimate), without necessarily being present in a lane or a teamfight.

 * *The Burst Gankers* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) may include Fiddlesticks, Lee Sin, Fizz, Evelynn, etc., and are generally characterized by his/her ability to initiate gank and ""burst"" down the enemy champion in 1 combo before he/she can Flash away.

 * *The Duelist* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) Jarvan IV, Vi, Udyr, Warwick, etc., and are characterized by his.her ability to duel 1v1 and win thanks to his/her kit. These champions are generally used to splitpush while the rest of the team ""forces"" a fight somewhere else. 

 * *The Teamfighters* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) may include Amumu, Galio, Jarvan IV, etc., and are characterized by his/her amazing CC potential for teamfights. Although he/she may not perform amazingly well in the jungle, or may be very prone being counter jungled, they will definitely pay back with his/her worth during 5v5 teamfights.

 * *The CC Machines* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) Nautilus, Amumu, Udyr, etc., and excel at constantly applying heavy CC to an individual enemy or the entire enemy team. These champions tend to be excessively tanky making them ideal initiators. 

 * *The Sustain Masters* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well) may include Warwick, Nunu, Xin Zhao, Vi, etc., and are characterized by his/her ability to stay very ""healthy"" while jungling allowing him/her to constantly stay within the jungle to apply pressure without having to go back and potentially getting behind. 

Those are the main categories, from my analysis, of all the types of champions that can be played in the Jungle. Again,  if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thank you again.

**Constructing your build as a Jungler**

Constructing your build as the Jungler is very situational, for you are very prone to either getting behind or getting ahead, Gold wise, making your reliance on just ""one build"" a very poor choice to pursue. Since you have the 2nd lowest Gold generation, 1 position higher than the Support, your build must be:

 * **Appropriate to the enemy composition,** if you're the initiator/tank, e.g. Warmog's for HP Stacking, Randuin's Omen to shutdown AA dependent ADCs, Bulwark for the ""balance"" AP and AD enemy team, Negatron Cloak for an AP heavy enemy team, etc.

 * **Cost efficient,** for you don't generate much gold through the Jungle or much from Assists either, from ganks, so you'll have to get ""cost-efficient"" items like Aegis of the Legion, Locket of the Iron Solari, Spirit buffs, Nashor's Tooth, etc. 

And that's my guide on How to play the Jungler! i hope you all enjoyed reading it and at least learned something from it. Again, if there's anything you guys think I missed or think I should add a section, just let me know in the comment section! Thanks guys!

**Note** I don't know what kind of guide to write next, so if you guys want me to write about something specific, like how to play a certain champion, (I've played all champions except all the ADCs (minus Ashe), or another guide on a certain lane like Support or Top Lane, or a guide on the fundamentals of Twisted Treeline, etc. Just let me know in the comments about what you'd all like for me to write about and I will!

1372656164.0,76,self.summonerschool,1herl5,"Tips from a jungler to botlane; or, How To Get Me To Gank For You 101",MisheardWhisper,92,16,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1herl5/tips_from_a_jungler_to_botlane_or_how_to_get_me/,"For some reason I've had a lot of issues with my botlanes recently while playing jungler. Perhaps it's just because I play a lot of support and am therefore more critical of their play, but it seems like botlanes have been the weak link in too many of my games recently. In all of these games, the AD carry and support have been crying out for ganks, which I would normally be happy to do to reset the lane.

Newsflash: bottom lane is the hardest lane to gank, and I am not going to gank needlessly. I might make a gank with low kill potential, for pressure/summoners/etc, but usually I won't waste my time. In botlane, this is especially important. Why?

Because in botlane, you have two players to contend with. One focuses on farming and putting out damage, and the other is in charge of map awareness, zoning, warding and generally being the most awesome dude on the team. Mid, top and ADC players at my level rarely ward, so it's easier to gank top or mid. Supports, however, unfortunately get stuck with warding for the whole team. This means that botlane is a battle for vision.

Before I gank, I am going to ask you two very important questions:

1. Are you warding?
2. Are they warding?

The first one I can obviously answer myself with a glance at the minimap, but the second one is your job as a support to answer (ADC has too much to focus on at this point in the game). Watch how many wards their support comes into lane with. Keep track of where he puts them. If he drops one in the lane brush, you can see the distinctive 'whoosh' graphic. Make a note of when it expires if you want, but that one's not *as* important. The most important wards are the ones he puts in the river.

If you see him place one (ie he doesn't go into the fog of war to do it) ping it and make a note in the chat along the lines of 'river bush warded'. I have timers on the chat, so I'll be able to scroll up and see when it was placed if I have to. If you feel like being super awesome, say something like 'river bush ward expires 0738' and I'll love you for it. Even more so if you ping me again thirty seconds before it expires with no replacement.

Better yet, counter-ward. The enemy support has no pink and you do? Pink the ward you just saw him place and blow it up. Let me know the duration on your pink, and I'll try and swing by before it ends if you need me to.

The ideal situation for a bottom-lane gank is this:

1. You have a pink ward in the river brush and they have nothing.
2. The enemy team has the lane pushed up.
3. I have vision on their jungler.

This last one is more for me to worry about, but it makes ganks a lot safer.

So basically, when you ask me to gank, even if it's 'OMG NOOB JUNGLER HASN'T GANKED BOT' (I got this at 5 minutes once after doing an initial clear, ganking top successfully and clearing some more before going to base) I *will* reply with 'Where have they warded?'. If you can't answer, I'm not going to waste my time and potentially my life on the off-chance they didn't ward. Because Murphy's Law says they did. The only way you're getting a gank botlane in that situation is if they're knocking on your turret and I see their jungler top.

Counterwarding is not a difficult thing to do, I try to do it every game I play support. It has two main parts: identifying where and when the enemy wards, and clearing them out. If you can do the first, great. That'll help me gank and I'll be happy with just that. If you can do the second part as well I will love you forever and camp bot for days, other lanes pending.

EDIT: As WardTax has pointed out to me, I didn't make one important thing terribly clear: I do *not* recommend cutting off all support from botlane just because they can't ward/counterward. If the enemy Draven keeps picking up kills on your AD carry, the problem's not going to go away if you ignore it. Come teamfight phase, you'll have a massively fed Glorious Executioner tearing your team to shreds and no sufficient answer. So I'm not saying don't gank at all; more that if they want to pull you away from your intended route (clearing, covering and ganking included), they need to make sure it's not wasted.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1372672891.0,,,True,t3_1herl5,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1herl5/tips_from_a_jungler_to_botlane_or_how_to_get_me/,

Yes, I have a retarded name for deliberate reasons - mainly to troll people who have l33tg4merN4M3Z and because I find it amusing to beat them with a stupid name.

I have played the game for 1.5 years, never once getting out of the 1300s and occasionally dipping into the 1100s. I would have described myself as a player with game knowledge that far exceeded my personal skill levels. This was a cause of great frustration for me, as being in low silver/high bronze made me feel like a grown-up locked in a kindergarten with a bunch of screaming kids.

I expect many of you are in this exact position and I intend to share with you how I have suddenly skyrocketed my elo. It all started when I was eating pizza in my underwear and watching XJ9 streaming his famously brutal jungle Vi. I was more interested in his macro-based decisions rather than his micro (explained later) and I wanted to understand why he chose to go where and when. After a couple of hours of watching his Vi and Hecarim everything just suddenly clicked and it all seemed so obvious. Shit, why can't I do that too?

I'd been a little shy of the jungle before, mainly trying to main mid and top lane in the 1200-1300s bracket. This is when I made several realisations of what was holding me back.

1. My mechanics are bad. I can last hit just fine, but I'm not capable of doing anything awesome in terms of keyboard and mouse acrobatics. My skillshot accuracy, however, is quite good.

2. I am bad at freezing/controlling lanes.

3. I am bad at attack-moving and kiting. This is why I avoid playing AD carry completely.

4. I am bad at making calculated trades/damage exchanges.

5. I am extremely terrified of being ganked, thus I play far too passively and spend too much gold on wards.

6. In my average game, I am like grass in the wind; I neither feed nor carry; I will not enable a losing team to win, nor a winning team to lose. I am just there - I don't make any plays and no one really notices.

7. It is too difficult to consistently get the popular mid and top lane at this elo and not then get immediately counterpicked.

So, after these epiphanies, I decided that it was going to be unrealistic to improve all of these areas, especially after 1.5 years of solid play. I instead decided to minimise those weaknesses completely and stick rigidly to jungle and support roles, allowing me to capitalise on my far stronger areas of play:

1. My map awareness and prediction skills are really good. I have a talent for reading the mind of the enemy jungler and anticipating his presence for a countergank. Is your ally low and cowering behind their tower? Wait in the jungle behind them and expect a dive. This works marvellously well.

2. My champion knowledge is excellent. I know exactly how to gank every lane in the game properly, even the difficult ones like Vlad, Kennen and LeBlanc. The secret is to pick a jungler that can actually gank them. If I see they have picked a Singed, Ezreal, Tristana, Corki, Kassadin, LeBlanc, Garen or Nidalee I will pick Vi every time, because Hecarim has huge problems ganking those champs - you need strong gap closers and heavy burst damage to secure those ganks.

Well, those were the strengths that I had at that moment. So, I immediately went ranked and spammed jungle Vi games using XJ9's build. Boom, shot over 1400 easily leaving behind a trail of horribly battered enemy teams behind me. I also played a lot of Hecarim also using XJ9's build to great success, often asking my team to pick an AOE comp, which completely obliterates low elo team fights.

**How you can get out of Silver:**

* Recognise your weaknesses and either work to strengthen them or minimise their use.
* Pick something to main and practice relentlessly. Perfect your style and become famous amongst your friends and feared amongst your enemies for your signature lane and champion.
* Find a pro player who is famous for using one or two champs and watch and emulate their playstyle religiously. I used XJ9's Vi and Hecarim.
* Use your brain, it is more powerful than any guide you can find. Enemy Akali is fed? Ditch your standard build and get that Negatron Cloak ASAP!
* If you're not typing anything of tactical value, shut up. Typing means you aren't in control and you're just distracting your team. Just shut the fuck up and play.
* Take as much responsibility as possible for any mistakes that your team makes. Try and blame yourself whenever possible; self-criticism is invaluable. Preaching in all chat to the enemy team about how your team sucks tells me, your jungler, that you're a worthless scrub and I shouldn't bother ganking your lane.
* As a jungler, distinguish the stronger players from the weaker ones as quickly as possible. If your Lux can't hit her skill shots, do not gank her lane. If your Yorick is 0/5 and getting dived by Akali, you should know how Yorick doesn't need items to be good in a teamfight and shoulb ignore his lane; he is worthless without your AD carry being strong so gank bot instead. If their bot lane is fed, do not gank it, as you will be ganking into a fed ad carry and support and will most likely give them a kill. Your 7/0 Fizz is excellent, but never wards? Ward his lane. Find your strong players, camp and ward their lanes. Give them the opportunity to carry you.
* As a solo-queue jungler, you must have all the emotions and empathy of a serial-killer; none whatsoever. You must be cold and calculating, ready to deprive your mid of blue if they are feeding, ready to mute the 0/5 Yorick that is crying about Akali behind his top tower, ready to camp that enemy bot lane mercilessly with pink wards. People will cry at you. You will mute them instantly without a word in reply.
* You must time your buffs, enemy wards, dragon, baron and flashes if possible. You can find a number of free iPhone apps for this.
* I bound both pings to my side mouse buttons and now I watch the map and ping my team constantly. This wins games, do it now. Ping before you gank, always.
* Know what you're capable of ganking and pick accordingly - Hecarim can't gank certain champs that Vi can easily secure kills on. However, if you have a Miss Fortune, Sona, Galio and Gangplank, Hecarim would be a much nastier pick for the wombo combo. I often pick Hecarim and ask my team to make an AOE comp.
* Farm. Junglers don't need to be poor; take CS and towers whenever you can when your lanes are unoccupied.
* Anticipate the enemy jungler and laners moves. Counter tower dives and ganks with smart prediction and warding.
* Forced a flash? Back off and gank them again immediately.
* Do not camp unless you are sure you have a very good chance of securing a kill.
* If your top laner is Malphite, don't pick Amumu; your team will lack damage late game.
* Assess your team's level one strengths and capability of initiating or defending from a level 1 invasion. If you are defending, ensure the jungle is scouted widely. I like to invade often, and lead my team around unpredictable paths in the enemy jungle.
* Don't smart-cast Q with Vi, it's much easier to use it with normal cast.
* There are only a few jungle main players compared to the hordes of top and mid mains. Master the jungle and allow the top and mid mains to take their favourite roles. Most junglers in solo queue pick it because they don't want to ad or support. If you're an experienced jungle main playing versus an enemy jungler who didn't get to top or mid, you're going to have a good time.
* Does your team comp have an initiation? Do you have at least one tank? Are you able to start a fight? If not then you are severely damaging your chances of winning. Do you have anyone capable of reaching that Vayne in their backline? It pains me when I am on a team of squishies and our jungler locks in Fiddlesticks.
* Enrage and annoy the enemy team as much as possible in all chat when you're dead or you have your hands free. Whilst dead, also watch the map and aid your allies with pings.
* Learn how to gank every lane. With mid, you should come from the side by their tower. Bot must usually ganked from behind your tower or by sneaking into the bottom brush, or ganked a high speed with Hecarim/Rammus from the river due to the constant warding. Mid is your most valuable lane to gank because your mid can assist you in ganking top and bot. Hecarim and Vi also excel at ganking enemies from behind their towers.
* If you're utterly hopeless at this game, spam Taric support in ranked because he is the most overpowered shit out there right now for how easy he is.
* If you are not either farming or ganking/counterganking or moving to do one of these at any given moment, you are not playing correctly.
* Many Silver players are dumb as shit (I used to be one) and will overextend without wards. Gank them over and over. Destroy them. Make them cry. Make them call you a babysitter. Kill them again and again and again.
* If you're far ahead and fed, abuse it as much as possible. Push towers and force your enemies into unfavourable fights.
* Buy red flasks even if you're not at full build.
* Enemy team comp has Irelia, Nocturne and Vayne or any large number of auto-attackers? Tell your top or support to get Frozen Heart and get a Randuin's and Ninja Tabi.

By the end of reading this, you are going to be the Hannibal Lector of the jungle; an utterly ruthless, cold and calculating monster. That is how I terrorised my way through Silver in EUW with the use of Vi and Hecarim. I now know what defines a low elo jungler; someone that camps Akali for 5 minutes when 0/5 Yorick whines and begs him to. 

Platinum is now an attainable and realistic goal for me now and I will post again with an AMA should I be successful.

Ok my TL;DR failed hard, but I hope you enjoyed reading this and learned something.

EDIT: My builds are on my lolking, but go like this - 

Hecarim: 

0/9/21 because these masteries are retardedly good on Hecarim. The XP bonus is so, so critically important because of how level-dependant Hecarim is. Movement Speed, CDR and sustain are also very useful. Going 21 in defence just makes you a slow-jungling, underlevelled brick.

9 ARpen marks, 9 armour seals, 9 MRes glyphs and speedy quints.

Get Spirit stone and boots first back, then Spirit of the Elder Lizard. If fed, get Iceborn Gauntlet. If behind, get Kindlegem and maybe then Spirit Visage. Buy the other item next and then get tank items. It's not necessary to buy and complete items in perfect order. Quite often, I'll finish SotEL and get a Kindlegem, Chain Vest, Negatron Cloak, Glacial Shroud, Spirit Visage and then finish my Iceborn Gauntlet. That would be me quickly adapting to strong AD and AP enemies, rather than just rushing Sheen after SotEL, which I would normally do when fed.

Do not be fooled into investing all of your gold into movement speed for Hecarim; it isn't necessary and just makes you squishy. You only need to be a little faster than your enemies to catch them, and your masteries and runes will do the trick. Hecarim's passive gives you a small amount of bonus AD, yet his AD scaling is poor. Hecarim's DPS scales best from levels, CDR and armour pen. The best component from his passive is the ignoring unit collision part.

Start W. Max Q&gt;W, E at 4.

Vi:

21/9/0 because you want to be a glass cannon terror early and mid game.

6 attack speed and 3 ARpen mars, armour seals, MRes glyphs and flat AD quints.

Boots, Brutaliser, spirit stone, Spirit of the Elder Lizard, then tank items with plenty of HP. Finish Black Cleaver at some point later. The early 20% CDR from Brutaliser and SotEL will enable you to gank with your ulti often, which is almost always a confirmed kill.

Start W, E, Q. Max E&gt;Q.

Have,Big_Papa_P,90,9,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/u5yu4/champs_everyone_should_and_can_have/,"Hey all, I comprised a small list of 4+ champs from each role in the current meta that are very cheap and very effective at their roles.  I'm doing this because some people don't know who to buy while they level up and because ranked is now(thankfully) removing free week champs from selection.  This list will give you a sizable champion pool for as little cost of IP as possible and give you many champions that are strong at their given roles.  

**Top Lane**

* Singed 1350 IP
* Jax 1350 IP
* Malphite 1350 IP
* Warwick 1350 IP
* Tryndamere 1350 IP
* Kayle 450 IP
* Total: 7200 IP
 
**Middle Lane**

* Ryze 450 IP
* Morgana 1350 IP
* Annie 450 IP
* Twisted Fate 1350 IP
* Veigar 1350 IP
* Total: 4950 IP

**Jungler**

* Warwick 1350 IP
* Dr.Mundo 1350 IP
* Amumu 1350 IP
* Fiddlesticks 1350 IP
* Total: 5400 IP

**Support**

* Soraka 450 IP
* Janna 1350 IP
* Alistar Free with Riot youtube channel subscription
* Taric 1350 IP
* Nunu 450 IP
* Total: 3600 IP

**AD Carry**

* Ashe 450 IP
* Sivir 450 IP
* Tristana Free with Riot Facebook like
* Corki 3150 IP (Next cheapest after first 3.  Rest are either 4800 or 6300 IP)
* Total: 4050 IP

As you can see, almost each list of 4+ champions is cheaper than a single 6300 champion at 1 role.   I see about 90% of these champions played in ranked on a consistent basis (if its in my elo range or on streams I see them).  So here you go! If you don't know who to buy for a role check out any of these champions! They are all very cheap, good and (most important) fun.  Take care now!

**Disclaimer!**
I know I forgot to note champs that can do well in multiple roles or forgot to name other champs, but I wanted as short of a list as possible and limiting each list to only 5 seemed most effective.

1374882838.0,76,self.summonerschool,1j4qc4,I made a rather large list of (not so) meta breaking champions to play!,Btf117,98,22,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1j4qc4/i_made_a_rather_large_list_of_not_so_meta/,"Hai folks. I've made a list of champions to play to spice up your gameplay. I find that variety makes League so much more fun to play. Now keep in mind these aren't really the most optimal to do, especially  in ranked games, but I find that it's just so much fun to try some new stuff in normals. You may have heard of some of these but regardless, these are some of my favorites. If they're in bold, this means I highly recommend them.

For people who don't like taking advice from non-pros, you can leave, I'm only Silver II. And as a support main, you'll see a lot of support suggestions and a lot of supports playing other roles.

**Important note - all the builds I suggest on these champs may not work for everyone. And, of course, these builds should be modified depending on matchups and how the game is going. Never follow the suggested builds like a bible.**
***
Support Urgot - Behind Olaf and Heimerdinger, he's the least played character in the League. And it's true, his high mana costs seem to be problematic as an ADC, even though Doublelift has no problem with him. But here's what makes Urgot strong as a support: 

* Passive reduces the damage output of targets affected by Urgot's AAs and Qs. It's like a mini exhaust every time he autos.
* Urgot's E shreds percentage armor. This allows your ADC to land more damage onto their opponents with their autos and this leads to more bullying.
* Urgot's ultimate (R, for consistency) provides vital utility to jump onto overextended targets, and grants your jungler solid positioning when he comes to gank. The additional defensive stats also allow the support to soak up more damage.
* Building him, I'd suggest normal support style with an added ToG and Zeke's Herald later game to keep Urgot's poke up.

I am actually 2-0 with Urgot support, and 0-1 against it.
***
**Jungle Lulu** - She OP, mang! Start blue and E with a pretty hard smiteless leash and begin your rolling. Lulu with attack speed is a strong bully in the top or mid lane already, but jungle Lulu should not be underestimated. 

* Her ganks are some of the best in the game, actually. Using W in, E on the enemy and land a Q. E puts pix onto your target, and because the mid is most likely walking in a straight line to get out of lane as fast as possible, and this makes landing the Q not typically difficult. The massive slow hits, and hopefully your lane can secure the kill.
* She's a support jungle. This can be a problem for some but the meta works with this style of jungler.
Ulting the ADC or mid and your EW provide awesome peel, which works when balancing an all-in support like Fiddle or Leona.

Now, jungling is pretty niche, so I'll give you the pros/cons of picking her jungle.

**Pros**

* Solid ganks
* Very strong 4-16
* Can be built AP or AD depending on the situation
* Provides good peel on potential high-value targets
* You are one with Phreak

**Cons**

* Mana hungry, may need multiple blues
* Pretty spell dependent
* Can fall off late game
* Dependent on successful ganks

She's so much fun, that's why I recommend her.
***
**Support Orianna** - Ori is a character that's pretty strong in the bot lane. You can play her in the kill lane style, but I'm a fan of standard support style Ori.

* Max R &gt; E &gt; W&gt; Q, this provides a good amount of shield for your ADC in lane, chase potential with W, and hard CC with Ult.
* Orianna is a poke support. Like Lulu and Nami, Ori is a bully. Her passive makes her autos hurt (dealing bonus magic damage on each hit), which allows for lane dominance.
* Ultimate sets up ganks. This works in favor of your jungler when you land a solid ult, pulling the target(s) back into the lane. Putting E --&gt; W on the jungler means anti-kite damage and faster arrival time.
* She's still plenty viable in teamfights. Ult's hard CC is very strong against channel characters like MF, Kat, Warwick, and Malzahar.

***

**ADC Thresh** - I've seen this done a lot more than any other of the suggestions here, but I recommend it for a reason. It's very strong.

* Max R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q. E is very important, I'll explain in a sec, and maxing W next for the reduced CD and shield size.
* E passive, where Thresh deals bonus magic damage on AAs, makes buildig AD so strong. At max rank it can hit up to 200% of AD in magic damage additionally. I hit for 1000 total with a fully charged passive E in an ARAM yesterday.
* Because ADC Thresh thrives on mixed damage, he's very difficult to counter. Likewise, I suggest hybrid pen somewhere in your rune page to deal extra damage.
* I find that I usually don't jump a second time when landing Q. Usually the target runs from me when I land it, so I use the pull and walk forward to use it as a gap close.
* W provides gap closing for your jungler when he comes to lane. Especially on purple team, instruct your jungler to stand in the tribush near your lane, let them push, pop a lantern and then Q, and that's a surprise gank very few people see coming.
* E and Q interrupt channeling spells like an MF ult, which works to your favor when counterpicking.
* Thresh works as a solo bot on Twisted Treeline. Lantern the camps your jungler is farming, pick up the souls, and bring your jungler into lane for a nice gank.
* And finally, an ADC Thresh provides utility like a boss with Ult slow.
***
Jungle Soraka - I took this off my recommended list because I am probably the only person that deal with playing it. Soraka's Q MR reduction makes her clear possible and kite/sustain potential with W allows her to not die immediately. Her ganks rely a lot on the enemy overextending, then Soraka comes in and heals the laner and then spams Q. I max R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E for maximum MR shred and damage. Now Soraka obviously has some issues in the jungle, like needing blue buff a lot and not the best ganks. But it works in baiting all-ins. I won't talk about it too much because it's pretty self explanatory. 
***
Mid Blitzcrank - Crunk is crazy in the midlane, especially post-6. His AP ratios are actually very good, and with a Lich Bane, he can be a menace.

* It's all about hitting the pulls with AP Crunk. He relies on landing the combo (both pre and post 6) and letting the enemy mid retreat after damage is done.
* Post 6, Crunk's short cooldown and both passive and active effects on his ultimate make him dealable in the mid lane. The silence shuts down quite a few APs and some AD casters and give them no choice but to back off.
* At any level, hitting a pull will set up a perfect opportunity for your jungler to gank. It works in favor of junglers that aren't so great pre 6, like Fiddle or Warwick, or junglers that need time to get into lane like Udyr.
* You can bait a lot of dives and ganks with mana barrier. It, when built with Archangels (or just ToG), soaks up a heavy amount of damage and allows you to escape back to your tower where you can QER for a potential kill.
* Because of Blitz's large mana costs, I suggest building Tear (into AA later), mobility or sorcerer's boots (depending on how much you like to roam), Lich Bane, Rabadons, Zhonya's, and DFG, Frozen Heart, or Banshee's depending on the situation and enemy team. 
***
Mid Taric - Another support going as an AP mid? Yup. Taric provides good CC and sustain to lane, along with good damage thanks to his passive.

* I max R &gt; W &gt; Q &gt; E. Shatter provides Taric with good AA poke prevention, and good Armor when facing an AD mid.
* Like I just mentioned, Taric works best against AD mid characters. W can do a lot of damage, but another great benefit is the armor shred it gives him. This works a lot when you have an AD jungler, such as Tiger Udyr, Xin, or J4 that will assist in planting a lot of damage down onto your opponent.
* Q kites and baits ganks. The heal won't be amazingly large because you're not maxing it first, but it still provides a lot of ability to kite and escape. Combined with E, Taric has very good single target escape, and, if your jungler is nearby, enough time for a countergank.
* When/if your enemy mid is out of lane, use can use R for the extra AD (or, even better, with your jungle) to push the mid tower. This can give you an extra boost for your other laners, and, if you want to, opens up more ganking patterns.
* Do not forget to ward! Taric isn't naturally that fast,  so you have to keep the brushes warded 
* I build Mid Taric a bit more tanky than usual AP mids, I take RoA, Archangels,  Zhonya's, Mobility, Sorcerer's, or Merc's for boots, Abyssal Scepter, and maybe a Rabadons or Banshee's. 
***
ADC Twisted Fate - I remember back in Season One that TF was played a lot as an AD character. Then again, I was just learning the game then, and most likely we didn't know how to build him.

* I max R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q. The passive AS bonus from E is what keeps ADC TF running.
* W provides solid utility. Picking Gold card will either force your opponents to back off, or you can hit them with it and land a few autos to get some free damage. Red card provides quicker wave clear and helps to keep minions off your tower, and Blue allows you to refresh your mana and continue poking with Q, although it won't do a lot of damage. Blue card has no utility benefit and thus deals the most damage.
* Supports that work well with TF include Nami, Janna, Lulu. Nami works the best with him because a TF gold card will set up an easy bubble (Aqua prison [Q]) or vice versa. Same goes with Janna's tornado. Nami also has sustain to keep TF up and Janna's E provides an AD steroid, so that can help TF is he builds AS before his AD.
* R gives you a great way to freely split push in later game. If your team doesn't have a good person to split push themselves, TF can take it. If they say ""ADC is not here, let's fight this"", you can ult in. If they all suddenly go MIA, you can ult, see were they're going, and escape if they're coming to block your split push. You can also surprise gank mid in the laning phase, hopefully netting you the kill. During this time, you should tell your jungler to pick up some farm in your lane. This will help him
* I usually build BotRK, Berseker's Greaves, Bloodthirster, Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer, and a Scimitar or another BT. Of course, like with most ADC builds, it's dependent on what you want to do, but I suggest, if anything, a good amount of attack speed to get E up faster.
***

**Top Rammus** - I've been playing since the release of Xin - so early season one. Karth was the first character I ever got a kill with, but Rammus quickly became my favorite champ and became the first champion I ever bought. I've played Rammy ranked since season one as well, but I sucked so bad in season one that I was 2-37. My point here is I'm not sure how well this works for others, but I've played Rammus for so long that I like him in any role.

* I only put Rammus as a top character because the goal is to face an AD. I actually think Rammus is better in the mid lane than he is top, because Rammus has amazing roaming potential and a good ability to assassinate squishies, but he falls in the fact he has no way to poke down ranged opponents and that can hurt your ability to farm.
* Armor. I played a ranked game where I first picked Rammus jungle (somehow I was beat out of playing support) and I was put against a team of four APs (Malz, Lux, Zac, Lulu, and MF). I knew that it would be annoying, so instead of completely compromising my damage, I built Aegis first (we did two bulwarks because our support wouldn't communicate, but that's beside the point) and built around the fact I needed MR to counter them. Because max rank E grants 120 Armor and MR, you can build some of the items you want to build anyway and don't compromise your whole build. Just don't be silly and build a thornmail. I'm not sure if this point made any sense, but what I mean to say is, still build *some* armor regardless of the situation.
* Fiddle's Q fear and Rammus' E taunt are probably on the same level of pure frustration. They are just cruel to play against. And that's why I max it first. &gt;:D
* I max R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q against lanes that you are doing fine against, and I suggest maxing W &gt; E &gt; R &gt; Q if losing, picking up only one point in your ult until E is maxed too.
* You are another great person to set up ganks, E, then W, and either fight them or lead them to your jungler/mid (whoever is ganking).
* I take Flash/Exhaust compared to my usual Flash/Teleport on top characters. Because Rammus is fast with Q, I don't find it vital to take teleport. Exhaust is my preferred option because Rammus will lack a chasing ability if he engages  with Q. Exhaust will guarantee (or almost guarantee) that you will win the trade or secure the kill on your opponent.
* Rammus' wave clear is like Shen's - pretty slow until you get sunfire. However, Rammus can use W and take aggro of the whole wave to clear it quickly. Just be careful of any opponents that try to use this to poke.
* Start defensively. Rammus is pretty weak at level one and early in general, so I start my builds with Boots + Pots, Cloth armor + ward + pots, or Rejuvenation bead + 2 wards + pots depending on your personal style and lane matchup.
* Against heavy AD teams, I build Tabi or Mobility, Sunfire, Thornmail, Warden's, Bulwark, and Frozen Heart.
* Against heavy AP teams, I build Bulwark, Merc's Treads, Tabi or Mobility, Sunfire, Spirit of the Ancient Golem, Warmog's, and Abyssal (in some cases).
* Against balanced teams, I build Tabi, Merc's, or mobility, Spirit of the Ancient Golem, Sunfire, Bulwark, Thornmail, and Warmogs or Warden's, depending on who on the enemy team is fed.
***
**AP Top or Mid Susan** - I'm not really sure if I should even give myself credit for this one, but besides my friends, I rarely see an AP Nasus. However, his ratios are pretty good and with farm on his Q he can be flat out unstoppable.

* Lich bane is a must. Because Q applies on hit effects, Lich bane provides instant bonus damage to your next auto, being able to deal significant amounts of damage.
* I max R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; W. I think it's pretty simple why: R and E are most impacted by AP, and your E does a lot of initial magic damage upon hitting, and if you land it correctly, it is nearly impossible to dodge and that means a good amount of damage on your opponents.
* Compared to AD Nasus, AP provides much stronger wave clear with E.  The initial damage + DoT on the caster (ranged) minions also sets up your Q nicely for snowballing potential. 
* Nasus has passive lifesteal and armor shred with E, so your autos and physical damage still hit for a lot. And with lich bane, your Qs hit for mixed damage making him very hard to build defensively against.
* It's also difficult to build offensively against Nasus. W slows down movement speed and attack speed by a ton, and this makes escaping him very difficult and also makes Nasus an excellent duelist.

I really hope you guys enjoyed this list. This took a very long time to create (I've been typing this out on mobile to and from camp everyday). I also apologize for my poor spelling and grammar, as that seems to be problematic on mobile.

I want to say again that some of these are not going to work for everyone. But, for people like me that like to mix it up every once in a while, it's fun to know you have more options (hence why I have every champion in the game) in different roles.

If you think this list is good, leave an upvote. I receive no karma and I would love for as many people as possible to see this list.

If you think this list, or one champion on the list is bad, please tell me why. I already know that these are not the best for their role or everyone would be playing them already.

Hi. I'm JYarbz. Some of you might know me for my [nidalee guide on solomid](http://www.solomid.net/guides.php?g=28999-jyarbz-nidalee-build-guide). Currently in Diamond V, though I haven't been playing much solo queue at all since the change to the new system. Two jobs and trying to play with a 5's team kinda take up all my time atm. :P If you want an example of a commentary I've already done, look at the s3 nid commentary on my guide. It's gotten a lot of positive feedback (though I'm aware it's really shitty quality, didn't know what I was doing when I made it).

Anyways, I'm thinking about making a jungle commentary as that's what I'm currently playing a lot of right now. To me, one of the most frustrating things when playing a game and trying to improve, is not understanding what I did wrong, to even have the chance to improve it. As a jungler, almost all of your outplay comes not in mechanics but in outhinking and out-decision making your opponent jungler. Jungler is the heaviest and most taxing of positions on your personal game knowledge. And if the other jungler has a higher game knowledge than you and wrecks your early game, it is the most devastating snowball a game can experience. Sure camping a single lane is awesome, but that doesn't usually win the game. When you get behind as a jungler, it doesn't just affect one lane, it affects the entire map.

Me personally as a player, I don't feel like mechanics are my strongest attribute. But I do feel like my game knowledge and decision making gives me an advantage over most of the players that I play against. I was thinking about doing a general commentary for a few minutes about the state of the jungle... like where support/tank junglers are and how to play vs the early game dominating fighter junglers that are popular right now and then do a commentary of an actual game going through all my decisions and why I made them.

TL;DR: Would you be interested in a jungle commentary highlighting early game decision making and game knowledge from a diamond player?

EDIT: Ok, I'll get on making one this weekend. Expect it by early next week, monday-ish. I'll update this post when it's finished and I'll probably make a new post entirely for the video.

EDIT2: Alright the video is finished and currently being uploaded, though I didn't put forth the effort to edit it or condense it into a shorter version. It's 50 minutes long, sorry. I just don't have much time right now to do it properly and prep beforehand so I don't stumble over my words a lot and condense the time down (sort of like writing and preparing a speech). I was just happy I had time to record or do anything that has to do with me having free time today. :P

1370035324.0,72,self.summonerschool,1fffw0,A Game of Pressure: This isn't Call of Duty,BlueNoseReindeer,91,19,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fffw0/a_game_of_pressure_this_isnt_call_of_duty/,"Hi guys, here's today's article. Let me know in the comments if you would want me to create a blog where I post these, I will keep using reddit either way.

A common mistake that I see even as a Platinum player is the inability to create genuine pressure (let's say that pressure is defined as your ability to control your opponent). To win League you need to kill the enemy team's nexus, not the necessarily the enemy team, and that means being able to take their turrets and inhibitors. Since they want to defend these, you must ""pressure"" them away from them.

With that being said, kills are often both a good way to create pressure, and an indicator of which team has more. This is why the team with the most kills usually wins, but not always. 

If you have pressure, you can get kills, take towers, kill dragon/baron, get inhibs, etc. because they can't stop you for whatever reason. Now, let's take a look at what some of those reasons are.

* Raw Power. Draven-Leona is the most powerful starting bot lane I can think of, and they create pressure just by existing. Why? Because any fight that they start they are almost guaranteed to win due to their burst/CC combo. Their early power allows them to position themselves wherever they want easily, allowing them to zone from cs, push towers, etc. They don't necessarily need to get kills to be effective, the threat of being able to kill is good enough. In a straight up fight with no turrets and equal minion damage, Draven-Leona will beat everything. Beating a Draven-Leona combo requires poking/kiting, lowering the amount of power they have to the point where they CAN be beaten in a fight (for more on team comps read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fa711/composition_analysis_next_level_solo_queing/).  Always remember (particularly at earlier stages of the game) that minion damage is factored into raw power, both in the jungle and the lane. A team with more raw power that maneuvers effectively (which is the trick) can safe take towers, dragons, and Barons, because they are favored to win fights. Understanding match ups (who counters who and why), as well as scaling, combined with the state of the game (what items, level, %HP/Mana, and buffs both you and they have) allow you to calculate everyone's raw power. As a side note, items are always more accurate in determining raw power than gold. A Kha'Zix with 5 kills isn't as scary as you think if he's bought 5 Fortitude Elixers.

* Wards. Wards create pressure if you use them correctly. Leona has bush control? Put a ward in (not next to her or she'll kill it) and for 3 minutes that bush is as much yours as hers. But then she pinks it, giving her control of the bush again, allowing her to zone you from the bush, *controlling where you go*, AKA creating pressure. Vision gives knowledge, and knowledge is power. Remember last paragraph When I talked about maneuvering properly? Wards allow you to do that by seeing what your enemy is doing, and what you need to do in response. More commonly, wards serve as anti-pressure, denying the enemy's ability to control you, so that in the end you can have more net pressure.

* Minion waves. Minions waves are a big part of why split pushers are viable in LoL. Take Singed for example, if League were about getting kills Singed would be a terrible champion. Because of his ability to destroy enemy minion waves, making his own bigger, he is able to splitpush, creating pressure. Because of this pressure the enemy goes to react, and will usually try to fight him, resulting in a chase, which is the only reason he can pick up kills. If Singed is able to draw more than one person to him, the rest of his team has a clear advantage, and can take objectives elsewhere. Setting up a massive minion wave, then moving to the opposite side of the map and pushing there has a similar effect. The enemy team must either send someone to deal with this wave and seriously risk losing a tower, or give up a tower to the minion wave. Pressure created, no kills required.

* Cooldowns. Cooldowns are essential to determining real Raw Power, not just potential Raw Power. In lane when Blitzcrank misses a hook you have at least 10 seconds to harass him where he can do nothing about it (closer to 15 at L1), because his Raw Power has dropped dramatically. This is why knowing/timing cooldowns (especially major ones, such as Shen and Karthus ults) is so important. If you are able to force/bait out an ultimate, your engage will be stronger than theirs, and you should use this to your advantage.
tl;dr Cooldowns of abilities are factors people overlook more than just about anything else. Take this into account when determining Raw Power to make a play.

* Jungler. Jungle pressure is something you probably hear a lot about, because it is the most significant early pressure that a team can exert, because it is the biggest hunk of Raw Power they can move about the map to make plays. A gank ultimately means a 3v2 or 2v1, and will almost always result in more Raw power for the ganker, which can result in kills or forcing someone out of lane. This type of pressure is designed to ""snowball"" a lane. What that means is that if the gank is successful, their is still work left to be done. After being given an advantage, the laner should (at least temporarily) have more Raw Power, and be able to create pressure for the team in their lane by 1: drawing enemy jungle pressure (and not falling to it) so that they cannot make plays on other lanes 2: taking the tower to give global gold/exp and increased roaming opportunities so that you can pressure other lanes 3: deny farm in order to reduce the amount of Raw Power that the enemy will have.

* Kills. Kills are a great way to set yourself ahead, and your opponent back, but during the laning phase if you recall at the wrong point in the creep wave progression you can make the kills meaningless and even a setback. Level stats are extremely important early on, and missing the experience from a couple waves may give the opportunity for the enemy to have more Raw Power than the longsword/amp tome that you just bought gave you. It's very important to distinguish between lategame kills, and early game kills. Early game kills can lead to snowballing, but if they don't, are relatively insignificant. Late game kills can lead to losing objectives, but if they don't, are similarly insignificant. As such, your mindset should be such that if you get kills in lane, you are looking to get yourself ahead and/or set the enemy back because this is how you create pressure. If you get kills after the laning phase, you want to take an objective because this is how you create pressure. If you think a game will run long, dragon&gt;tower; if you think a game will be short tower&gt;dragon.

* Most Net Pressure. As several of the previous paragraphs (the last one in particular) have alluded to, you need to factor in not just how much pressure you are applying, but what the enemy is doing in response. It doesn't matter if you are able to take the first two towers on Bot and Mid if Tryndamere has taken down top lane to the Nexus turrets. The end goal of pressuring objectives is to kill their Nexus before they kill yours. Keep this in mind when deciding when you need to stop pushing (or taking a Baron) to deal with enemy pressure.

(I'm sure I'm not including everything, feel free to suggest other things, which I may add to the list)

League is an objective-oriented game, and if you want to win you need to have an objective-oriented mindset. Taking into consideration both your composition, and the enemy team's, and applying pressure to objectives as best you can given those compositions (i.e. grouping as an AOE comp, splitpushing as a splitpush comp, etc.) is how you win games.

Sadly, support is hard to influence games with unless you are much more consistent or have an adc to play with. I've learned both, but I have only recently started winning games again, not because of skill or luck, but because I CAN carry a team.

Now, another thing is there really ARE games you cannot carry, but you should try to. You learn how to manipulate people into doing what they should be. Psychological. Fuck all that shit about followijg a teammate to your and his death. If he dies, great. If you both die, even better for their team. Also, don't fucking EVER ask why they did that. Dont ask. Dont. Ever. Ask. Anything.  You derail them, and yourself. You asking is just as bad as saying ""fuk u noob ass yi get repoted hueheuheuehu.""

Say stuff like ""dont worry about it, come gank bot for us jungle, we are ahead, come get an easy kill."" Or ""follow me and ill stun for you so you get the kill.

**Basically what it comes down to is that people are greedy, ignorant of others, self righteous, and their ego will make them think they are the best.**

Dont feed their ego, but dont try to break it either. Be a stepping stone. 

Also, if you have an insanely bad team that won't communicate at all even when being really (and i mean you are legitimately trying to help THEM and not you) positive and communicative, there is always a way to carry them. 

Solo queue is mostly social engineering, and holy hell my moving average is so high right now. 25 per win 14 per loss. It really helped taking a week long break and being more calm when playing.

Her passive grants her stealth when out of combat for a certain amount of time. Q is a spammable line that shoots out from her location. She has a melee nuke and a speed boost. Her ultimate is AoE, slows, deals %max HP damage and grants her a shield. Her burst after Deathfire Grasp is very high. Be careful if she is MIA as Eve has amazing roam potential. Most often seen mid, although sometimes jungles. Average difficulty.

**Ezreal**: Ranged, skillshot based AD carry. He has great poke with his Q, a long ranged skillshot, and his W, a medium ranged skillshot that passes through minions. His E is a ground-targetted blink. His ultimate is a wide, global skillshot. His W, E and ultimate all do magic damage. He will often buy Phage/Trinity Force for the slows, which proc on his Q. His burst damage is very high during early and mid game, as is his mobility. Seen bot lane. Average difficulty.

**Fiddlesticks**: Medium ranged AP caster with huge AoE damage potential. He has a long duration fear with his Q, and a silence that bounces to nearby champions and minions on his E. His W, Drain, is a channelled spell that deals damage and returns health to Fiddlesticks over time. His ultimate is a blink that will cause crows to fly around him for the next 5 seconds, dealing huge amounts of damage. He will often try to sneak up on you behind walls and use his ultimate, however, his MR-lowering passive appears as a debuff on you. Most often seen jungle, although occasionally supports or mids. Fairly easy to use.

**Fiora**: Melee AD carry/bruiser with amazing trade potential. She has free sustain off of autoattacks with her passive. Her Q is a dash that can be used twice per cast. She has a huge AS steroid with her E, and her W, whilst also giving free AD, grants a shield that reflects the first autoattack that hits it. Her ultimate makes her untargettable as she dashes to various champions near her. Her ultimate will always start and end on the same person. Be careful of her damage at level six as it can often net her a kill. By keeping an eye on the first target, you can plan your CC to be sure it hits her. Found top lane. Average difficulty.

**Fizz**: Melee, magic damage assassin with high mobility and burst damage. His Q is a dash that will proc on-hit effects like Lich Bane. His W is a DoT that deals more damage the lower you are. His E is a two-part spell that, on first cast, jumps and makes him untargettable. He can cast it again to jump again and deal damage in a small AoE, or leave it to deal damage in a medium AoE and slow. His ultimate fires a fish that after a small amount of time summons and shark, damaging and knocking up whoever it hits. His damage at level three is very high and should not be underestimated. His E can be used to jump walls. His roaming potential is very good. Mainly found in mid lane. Hard to use.

**Galio**: Melee tanky mage with an AoE lockdown ultimate. His Q is a targetted AoE that slows. His shield grants bonus MR and armour to whoever he chooses, and heals Galio every time the shielded person is hit. His E is a skillshot that damages and grants bonus movespeed to people who walk in the direction he fired it. His ultimate is a channelled spell that taunts enemies nearby and explodes after a duration, damaging enemies in the AoE. Galio's passive gives him AP based on his MR, so he works well as a counterpick to AP mids. His ultimate is devastating in teamfights, especially coupled with flash, but can be cancelled with hard CC. Found in mid lane. Fairly difficult to use.

**Gangplank**: A pirate! Yaharr! Also a melee bruiser with good poke and sustain. His Q is a ranged point-click that applies on-hit and, if it kills a minion, grants extra gold and refunds half the mana. His W heals him and removes all CC. His E is a passive steroid that, when activated, grants AD and MS to everyone around him. His ultimate is a global AoE that deals random damage over six seconds and slows. He is quite capable of farming against almost any lane. His poke is quite good with Q, especially with Trinity Force. Try to keep his ult in mind, both when playing and playing against him. Found in top lane mostly, although sometimes jungles, mids and supports. Easy to use.

**Garen**: Manaless melee bruiser with good single-target kill potential and great innate tankiness. His Q removes slows and silences upon his next autoattack. His W is a shield that reduces all damage he takes, whilst also granting bonus armour and MR. His E is a spin that lasts for three seconds, damaging every half second. His ultimate drops a giant sword from the sky, dealing bonus damage based on how much health you're missing. His passive gives him bonus regen when out of combat. He has high early-game damage with his spin, so beware when trading with him. Try to keep his passive down, as he will regenerate health back very quickly. Found in top lane. Easy to use.

**Gragas**: Melee, magic damage mage with a displacement ult, good poke, good mobility and good sustain. His Q is a targetted AoE that, when triggered again, explodes and deals damage in the area. His W is a brief channel that restores mana over a duration. His E is a dash that slows and damages on impact. His ultimate is a targetted AoE that knocks people back from the centre of the area, and also damages them. Gragas' waveclear and sustain is quite potent, making him a strong laner. His ultimate is excellent for engaging/disengaging. Found in mid lane. Fairly hard to use.

**Graves**: Short-ranged AD carry with strong early game burst damage. His passive grants him armour and MR in combat. His Q is a cone shot which deals more damage if you are close to him. He has a vision-restricting smokescreen and a dash/AS steroid. His ultimate is a skillshot that deals damage to the first person it hits and everyone in a cone behind them. Graves' burst with his Q is very potent, particularly when paired with a support that has hard CC like Taric or Leona. His range is very short, however, and he can therefore be zoned quite easily. Found in bot lane. Fairly easy to use.

**Hecarim**: Melee bruiser with high mobility and good teamfighting ability. His passive grants him AD based on movement speed. His Q is an AoE that has its cooldown reduced if it hits someone. His W deals a small amount of magic damage over time in an AoE, and also grants healing off of all damage your team does inside the circle. E is a movement speed steroid and knockback. His ult is a long-ranged dash that fears people on impact. His mobility through the jungle is very high so beware if he was seen in the closest lane recently. Found in the jungle. Average difficulty.

**Heimerdinger**: Magic damage caster with good poke and heavy reliance on turrets. His Q will place down a turret with indefinite lifespan and average range that shoots at the nearest target. His W fires three rockets at the three nearest targets. His E is a slow-travelling AoE grenade that stuns people in the centre. His ultimate grants bonuses to his skills for a short amount of time: slowing turret shots, 5 rockets, faster grenade travel speed. He naturally pushes lane with his turrets, and as he has no escapes he is quite vulnerable to ganks. Found in mid lane. Average difficulty.

**Irelia**: Melee bruiser with good sustain and mobility. Her passive gives her tenacity based on how many nearby enemy champions. Her Q is a dash that, if it kills the target (minion or champion), has its cooldown reset. Her W gives her a small amount of HP back on hit, and doubles this for 6 (?) seconds on activation, also giving her true damage on her autoattacks. Her E is a stun if they have a higher HP% than you, and a slow if they have lower. Her ultimate gives her four skillshots that heal upon damaging things. Levels 1-4 are her weakest, to try bully her during that time. She scales excellently with attack speed, so AS slows are good tools for reducing her damage output. She is an amazing carry diver. Found in top lane. Average difficulty.

**Janna**: Ranged support with very high utility. Her passive gives MS to everyone on your team. Her Q is a long-ranged knockup skillshot that gains range depending on how long it was charged for. She has a shield that grants AD, and also a single-target slow that, when not on cooldown, also grants Janna bonus MS. Janna's ultimate is a circular knock back that also heals nearby team mates for 3 seconds or until canceled. Her ability to reset teamfights is unparralelled. She works very well with AD carries as she can grant them AD as well as peel for them. Found in bottom lane. Hard to use.

**Jarvan IV**: Melee manly bruiser with good utility, burst and mobility. His Q is a skillshot that damages and reduces armour. His W is a slowing AoE that also shields Jarvan, with bonus shielding based on nearby enemy champs. His E is a ground-targetted AoE that lasts for a few seconds and grants armour and AS to nearby champions, as well as granting the same stats to Jarvan. His ultimate is a targetted jump that creates unpassable terrain around the target for a few seconds. In addition to this, if Jarvan casts his Q and hits his E, he will be pulled to the location of his E and knockup targets along the way. His early game burst is quite high with his EQ combo. His ganks are also very potent if you get caught by the knockup. Found in top and jungle. Average difficulty.

**Jax**: Melee hybrid bruiser with good mobility and amazing 1v1 potential. His passive gives him stacking AS on autoattacks. His Q is a jump that can be used on enemies and allies. His W is a magic-damage autoattack reset. His E is a 2-second spell that dodges all autoattacks during its duration and stuns when it finishes. His ultimate passively gives him magic damage on every third hit, and when activated gives him bonus armour and MR based on his AD and AP. Despite being hybrid, Jax should be build with an emphasis on attack damage. Found in top lane.

1352880951.0,77,self.summonerschool,1368jz,For people starting ranked new in Season 3. Please read (My random tips). Long read but worth it!,Dancingg,86,9,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1368jz/for_people_starting_ranked_new_in_season_3_please/,"Many new people are gonna be hopping into (Pre)Season 3 ranked. But please don't hop in if you don't feel you're ready. It will only lead to ELO loss and you asking the question ""How did I end up here?"".

What I'm about to tell you may seem like common sense but you wouldn't believe the amount of replays I've watched/critiqued on of players who believe they shouldn't be in ""ELO hell"" yet they lack FUNDAMENTALS. Yes that's right. I'd say most level 30 players still lack fundamentals. Let me run down the most common problems people have that cause them to do poorly in games in hopes that maybe you newer ranked players will take heed and make sure to learn these skills/mechanics before jumping into ranked.

- CS/last hitting. Please stop auto attacking guys. You're only hurting yourself/lane. There ARE times where auto attacking is fine but you still have to learn to move around and last hit while pushing the lane up as well as making sure to push up when it's safe/warded. When you auto attack you're going to push the lane up as well as it'll be harder to last hit. Practice last hitting as well as focusing on the enemy. If you have nothing to last hit and they're about to last hit your minion? Go in for some free damage. I think of it this way. If I can farm two whole waves without missing a CS in the early game, that's about 250 gold (Almost a kill's worth!) on top of the passive gold earned overtime. GET THOSE LAST HITS.

- Map awareness. Unskilled players get tunnel visioned and even the best of us get it from time to time. But the less time you're looking at your map is more time for the enemy to move under your radar. Think of how large a ward reveals. It's about 3-4 seconds for them to run into range and out of range again. That's a small window for you to miss and possibly be ganked. When you ward. Keep checking the map. You'll usually be farming anyways so if there's nothing to last hit check your map foo! It's not just wards either. If you see 3 MIA and you're pushing top without any wards. You're going to have a bad time. If you see the enemy go off vision. Always think of what routes they can possibly take (Did they go back and buy? Are they grabbing buffs/objectives? Am I going to get ganked?)

- Lack of wards. Don't rely on your support or jungle to ward. EVERYONE should buy wards (AD is probably the one who's least likely to buy them). This ties into map awareness. Know the good ward spots for the map and I can't tell you how many times I died due to lack of warding and how many times warding has saved my life and even won games.

- Communication. This is a bit harder in solo queue but do your best to speak up. If you know something let the other team know! Always assume they're not paying attention. Of course don't spam ping or anything but when I play top (My main role) if I'm just farming I'm looking at my map as well. I'll sometimes spot the enemy jungler in a ward of ours and I'll ping that for my team so they know the location. This allows them to play around that (ie Play safer/more aggressive)

- STAY ALIVE and DON'T GET GREEDY. Almost every lower ELO game I see has about 20-30 kills/deaths for each side at like the 25 minute mark. Yet the farm count is extremely low. People who are less skilled tend to just focus on kills. It's also the reason people get the bad habit of getting greedy. They'll keep pushing their lane, get ganked, come back with no wards, get ganked again, and their opponent will do the same. It's just trading kills almost what it feels like. Every time you die you're giving the other team gold. And it's not just gold. It's assist gold+lane/item advantage+Chance to get objectives+losing your tower+Their moral going up. Many negative things of dying. If you can stay alive for the most part and at least farm/level up you'll do a lot better than most players.

- Objectives. They mean a lot. I've seen a game where neither team got dragon ONCE. You only think it's 190 gold for yourself but that's 950 gold for your whole team which is a lot. If you get that first dragon and keep the timer? You can keep getting it usually. Also timers. Know them. Baron is 7 minute respawn, Dragon is 6, Buffs are 5. When you see one go down type the time in chat when it'll respawn. Your team can then respond to that later on.

- Know your role! A specific example of what I mean is for AD carries. Many times in team fights I'll see an AD jump into a fight and gun for the other AD carry or any other squishy. They proceed to get blown up. AD carries should be whittling down whoevers close and allow the bruisers to smash the other squishies. If you see a squishy near you? Sure it's good to blow him/her up but please don't chase them through a fight. Also know your role's mechanics. For example, AD carries, a FUNDAMENTAL SKILL is learning to move in between auto attacks. You can kite this way as well as chase better, overall increasing your DPS. Also keeps your hands warm and ready. Practice this through last hitting as well.

Well that's all I have for now. Maybe I'll update it later if I come up with more. Feel free to add your own too!

1331843285.0,73,self.summonerschool,qyalx,You've all heard Dragon is important. Here's why it's important to YOU.,Gstamsharp,81,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/qyalx/youve_all_heard_dragon_is_important_heres_why_its/,"So you've probably been beaten over the head with people telling you how important killing the dragon is on Summoner's Rift, and if you've seen any pro games or watched any high level streams you've probably seen all the intense fighting that goes on over who controls it. You probably know, in a general way, that it's important because it gives you gold.

Regardless of this incredibly common knowledge, you've also probably played dozens of games where people completely forget that big ol' lizard even exists, and you probably ignore it a lot as well. The reason is that it doesn't really seem that important to most people in a personal way. That burst of gold doesn't feel like a lot compared to farming up another couple waves of minions or getting some kills and it can be difficult to organize your team to kill it (heck it might even kill YOU at lower levels). So why bother, right?

Wrong! Have you ever been 5 deaths behind and just felt like the game was going to snowball hopelessly against you? Ever been annoyed that your support never has any gold for auras or doesn't buy enough wards? Ever had a jungler who just couldn't gank your lane for the life of him because it was too heavily warded, but nobody had the cash to blow on an oracle's elixer? Well, there's a simple solution for all of those seemingly hopeless situations: **kill the dragon!**

First of all, understand the dragon is worth 975 gold for your team (190 per person and 25 to the killer). That's worth around 2 to 3 kills, and worth more than a tower! **If your team is behind by 2 or 3 kills, bagging the dragon realistically makes your scores even!** Behind 6 kills but got 3 dragons? You're practically winning! Dragon gold alone can help your entire team come back from bad early games, and grabbing a few of them can even make up for a good bit of feeding. The tower point is also important: towers do not respawn. The enemy cannot destroy your tower again for more gold, while you can kill the dragon next time it spawns. Also, the enemy's tower is still there, waiting to hand you a nice stack of gold when you do get around to knocking it over.

Now, you may say, sure that all makes sense, and I get it benefits my whole team, but it's still only 190 gold for ME. In reality, you are directly benefiting from it more than you realize. First, that's an extra 190 gold for you and all your teammates to spend on wards and elixers which can give you a sudden upper hand against your enemy. That gold is enough for a pink ward, which might sweep your enemies' wards in your lane and let your jungler pull off that gank you've been begging for all game, for example. Second, remember your support relies entirely on assists and gp10 items for money, and nabbing a few dragons can DRASTICALLY increase their ability to buy items. Your support having enough spare gold to grab that Aegis of the Legion or Zeke's Herald before the big team fight starts can have a huge effect on the outcome! **Every big item your support can afford is like YOU getting extra items for free**--never forget that! That extra gold on other players can and does directly benefit you and your lane.

While against lower skill opponents you may be able to take dragon completely unopposed, against tougher enemies going for the dragon can have one additional benefit: **initiating team fights on your terms**. Many games you are losing early on are due to the enemy having excellent ganks or good counter picks, but many of those advantages disappear completely once a team fight breaks out and everything is out in the open. A well planned dragon can net you not only the dragon but also a bunch of kills from an enemy unprepared for a full-on battle. This is especially true against late-game type enemy teams (a team which will get very strong by the end of the game but which is weaker early). And hey, you can't argue with being able to bait the enemy into a trap no matter how little credit you give to the dragon.

So next time you get a kill or two, push your lane up too far to farm, want to bait a team fight, or really ANY TIME YOU ARE EVER BEHIND (or heck, even when you are ahead to cement that lead), grab a team mate or two and take down the dragon. You'll be pleasantly surprised by how many games you can turn around just by paying a little attention to your fire-breathing friend.

Edit: As mentioned in the comments, the Dragon first spawns at 2:30 (although it will probably be very hard to kill until 5 to 10 minutes into the game), and it will respawn 6 minutes after its death, so plan accordingly to take full advantage of it! Also, try to always have someone with smite take the last hit to ensure the last hit isn't stolen by some sneaky enemy.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,True,,,True,t3_qyalx,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/qyalx/youve_all_heard_dragon_is_important_heres_why_its/,

--------------------------

**RANKED FAQ**

* **When should I start ranked games?**
 
[Here's a tip: Do NOT start ranked as soon as you hit 30!](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1d8zmx/ranked_faq_for_all_your_ranked_game_questions/c9ocdd3) There is no set number of games or wins over losses in normals that will let you know when to start ranked, but the general idea is that having a good champion pool [know one or two roles really well with a decent champion pool, and know the other roles well enough to play them if need be], adequate rune pages [AD/support/jungle/AP would be my suggestions], and a good attitude [probably the most important]. 

* **How does the league/division system work?**

Leagues are the leagues of League of Legends. They range, in order of lowest league to the highest, from Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Challenger. Each league is subdivided into five divisions, which are numbered from 1-5 [5 being the lowest division in the league]. 

Starting ranked, each player will play through ten placement matches, during which they will gain or lose what Riot calls League Points [LP for short]. Every win will earn the player LP, while loses will decrease LP. During the ten placement matches, your LP and current league/division are hidden to you while the system sorts you into a league based on your performance. It should be noted that these placement matches have a huge fluctuation in gains and losses of LP, ergo each win or loss may net you +50 or -50 LP respectively. 

* **How do I move in leagues/divisions?**

Once you have gained 100 LP from winning games, you will be given a chance to move to a higher division. This is called a promotional series - you have to win the next two out of three ranked games to be promoted. Dodging will end the player's promotional series and eliminate some the player's LP. On a rare occasion, a player who has an extremely high Match Making Rating [MMR] will advance two divisions upon winning a promotion.

To advance leagues, a player must be in tier one of their league and they must have 100 LP. Upon reaching that threshold, players are given the opportunity to advance to a higher league by winning three out of their next five games. Dodging will reset the series and eliminate some of the player's LP. Unlike divisions, players can not move up more than one league.

To get demoted from a division, a player must be at 0 LP. Demotions occur when the player's MMR is too low for division the player is in and he/she loses a few games in a row at 0 LP [generally 2-4 games], which further contributes to a lowered MMR. There is about a three game grace period for players entering a new division before they can be demoted.

Players can not be demoted from a league once they get in, save for being inactive in ranked for four weeks. Inactivity will reduce the player's LP by a set amount per week after the four week period, and if the decay continues the player will drop divisions and leagues.

* **What is Match Making Rating [MMR]?**

MMR can be thought of, if you played back in Season Two, a hidden Elo. Basically, it is a hidden rating tied to every summoner playing in ranked that determines who the player plays against. Every game a player wins will raise their MMR, while every game they lose will decrease their MMR. Players with a high MMR will gain more LP per win and lose less per loss.

Leagues/divisions do not determine who the player will play against. A player who got boosted to Diamond V may lose 50 games in a row and still maintain his Diamond V status, but his hidden MMR will be on the level of, say, a Silver III player. 

MMR is invisible to the player, but the site LoLKing.net gives a [LoLKing score](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1d8zmx/ranked_faq_for_all_your_ranked_game_questions/c9od7xw) that can be used to measure improvement in a player's skill level.

* **Why am I only gaining 1-3 LP per win, but losing 25+ per loss?**

There are a few reasons for poor LP gains on wins. Players who have a low MMR will gain less LP per win/lose more LP per loss because the system does not believe the player belongs where he/she is. In addition, players close to 100 LP, or a promotional series, will gain less LP as they get closer to 100. Summoners stuck at 99 LP will stay there until the system determines that their MMR is at an adequate level to advance to their promotional series.

* **Okay! I'm in champ select, but what is this whole pick order everyone keeps speaking of?**

In champion select, players are arranged from top to bottom in order of their hidden MMR. The player at the top of the champion select screen has the highest MMR, while the player at the bottom has the lowest.

There is a general notion in ranked and draft games that pick order, in which people get the roles they want in order of how they are arranged in champion select [the player at the top gets any role he wants, while the player at the bottom is stuck with whatever is left], is greater than call order, in which players say which role[s] they prefer to play. In general, call order is respected in ranked, but when two players compete over the same role, the higher player usually wins due to them being, as believed, better at the game.

In general, be prepared to play any role in ranked before you hop in!

* **Help! I win my lane really hard every game but all these f33d3r n00bs are holding me back in Bronze III!**

League of Legends is a team game, and ranked games are no different. To improve in play, a player must analyze their own mistakes. Every league and division has trolls and ragers, but the only true constant in any game played is the player him/herself.

* #1 If you are not first pick plan on not getting the role you want. There is no calling dibs, I don't care if you said it during bans if they pick before you they get it. Just give the role you are the worst at and let someone try to fill that.

* #2 Once you hit the loading screen no one should mention picks or bans again. There is nothing to be done about it now, all you will do is ruin the moral of your team. Nut up show you are the better player and win the game.

* #3 When stuck in your worse possible role **deal with it**. It happens you may not even have runes for it but it happens, your job is to do the best you can and hope the team can cover your short comings in the role.

* #4 If someone takes your main role and then does poorly, be quite and play. I don't want to hear how they picked a bad champ, or how you could have done so much better. Its easy to talk big when there is no way for you to take action, for all we know you would have gotten stomped worse. All it does is make everyone hate you and the player doing poorly, which guess what makes them play worse.

* #5 If the champion you said you wanted to play gets banned by your first pick, **DEAL WITH IT**. The champion you wanted to play was obviously strong, that's why you wanted to play them isn't it? First pick figured it wasn't worth the risk of the other team getting it since you are not first pick, nothing can be done about it anymore so shut up and play something else.

* #6 Trades are never really a good option unless in voice chat, and if done so tell your team about the trade. Trades are next too impossible on the fly due to everyone owning different champs. I don't want to see a 20 champion list in chat because its impossible to set up comps or starts through that. When in doubt ban it out, leave trades to duos/teams.

* #7 Lastly let people play what they want. Sure it may not be the most productive thing, hell it might even cost you a few games. But in the end all you can do is focus on your play. Sitting there bitching at someone for 40 minutes will simply put you in a bad mood and make you play worse. If its outside of your control leave it, make small suggestions in champ select and explain the reasoning. After that #2 applies.

I hope this lets some of you stop and look at how you have acted in the past.

Hello summonerschool, I’m here with an analysis of top lane. Today I’ll be looking at the factors behind top lane and examples of the different champions that excel at these factors. By writing this analysis, I hope that readers will be smarter in choosing their champions and improve their experience in top lane.

 
**Zoning Capabilities**
 

If you have ever watched or played any sort of fighting game, then you should know that a major part of the game is being able to control areas of the screen and force your opponent where you want them to be. This concept applies to League of Legends as well, since you want to force your opponent away from minions to deny them experience and gold. This causes them to fall behind, put themselves in danger to keep up with you, or forces their jungler to come top and try to even the lane (which relieves pressure on other lanes and often leads to an uncontested dragon). Champions with strong zoning capabilities abuse the weaknesses of their opponent and dominate them in lane. Almost any top champion can be considered strong at zoning, but the ones that shine are ones that continue to wreak havoc past the laning phase (aka snowballing).
 

Examples of strong champions at zoning – Darius, Teemo, Nidalee, Akali (post-6), Kayle, Elise
 

**Sustain**
 

Champions can only stay in lane as long as they have a sufficient amount of hp. To avoid going back to base to heal, sustain is a very important aspect of laning as well. With the start of season 3, it is very common to see opening builds which favored sustain over damage/mobility. Aside from health potions, many champions have abilities that give them an edge in sustain. This is very important as a champion that might have weak zoning capabilities can instead abuse their sustain and simply outlast their opponent, forcing them to go back to base while you push to their tower and deny them creeps while they are gone. 
 

Examples of strong champions at sustaining – Yorick, Nidalee, Kayle, Cho'gath, Garen, Vladimir
 

**Escape**
 

Top lane is very susceptible to ganks as the distance between towers is much larger than that of the middle lane. Therefore, you must have the means to reach the safety of your tower before you die, either by being tanky enough or having a good escape. Champions with good escapes often feel no pressure from junglers and can put themselves in riskier situations without much fear. While not as important as sustain or zoning, it’s definitely a good trait to have and could lead to split pushing later in the game. Good escapes include bursts of movement speeds and abilities that mimic flash.
 

Examples of strong champions at escaping – Kennen, Nidalee, Singed, Garen, Tryndamere, Renekton, Zed
 

**Consistent Harass**
 

This factor ties in a bit with zoning, but I felt it warranted its own section. One of the huge advantages that manaless champions have is that they can (usually) spam their abilities constantly and force an opponent to duel them (and lose mana in the process) or escape. By depleting your opponent’s resources, you can harass them without retaliation and push them out of the lane. Likewise, you can also push your lane to their tower and make your opponent miss minion kills if they can’t fight back. Champions with low mana cost abilities or ranged attacks are also great at being able to consistently harass.
 

Examples of strong champions at consistent harass – Generally any manaless champion, Elise, Teemo
 

**Last Hitting**
 

Being able to last hit is the most important skill in League of Legends, hands down. Despite its reliance on player skill, there are champions that can last hit much more effectively than others. This trait really comes into effect when you are pushed to your tower or you are being zoned and can’t be close enough to auto attack minions. Anyone who plays top lane needs to have atleast one champion that can safely farm at a distance regardless of whom you are against or be able to force the minion wave to your tower to farm there.
 

Examples of strong champions at last hitting – Kennen, Irelia, Nidalee, Jayce, Nasus, Zed
 

**Baiting**
 

One of the best things a top laner can do is force the opposing jungler to top lane while your team takes objectives (bot tower, dragon). Baiting can really turn the game in your favor, especially if you can force the 2v1 in your favor and get a double kill. This includes champions with deceptive burst or champions that can kite while doing damage, only to turn around and complete the kill. Using the bushes is crucial to how you bait as it masks your position and forces your opponent to play a guessing game on where you may or may not be. An example would be using a gap closer on a nearby minion wave as an enemy is about to enter the bush or faking out your enemy by running the complete opposite direction than they are expecting (try running past their tower into their jungle and using fog of war to your advantage to avoid others, it's highly effective early on in the game).
 

Examples of strong champions at baiting – Rumble, Singed, Garen, Teemo
 

**Picking your champion**
 

Now that we have all these defined, we can take a look at how to pick a top lane without being hard countered. When you are forced to select a champion before your opponent does, it is usually beneficial to pick a champion with strong sustain, last hitting capabilities, or consistent harass. A champion which has a ranged attack (or a ranged skill, such as Rumble) makes for a strong first pick as it is much harder to zone out a champion which doesn’t have to be in melee range to get minion kills. Sustain allows you to outlast your opponent if you happen to be countered. Consistent harass is also a good trait as your opponent shouldn’t be able to push to your tower without taking any sort of damage. An example of a bad first pick would be Gangplank, as he has only one damaging ability and it would only take a champion with consistent damage output to shut him down in lane. Garen would also be a bad first pick as the entire enemy team will be thinking about ways to keep you at a distance and pick accordingly.
 

If you are fortunate enough to pick after their top lane has been determined, you can use the knowledge to your advantage to pick a champ with strong zoning capabilities and the ability to bait an enemy jungler (not as important). Since there are many champions that can fulfill that category, it’s imperative to pick one that will utterly dominate your opponent, such as picking Darius or Elise against melee champions with low early game damage (Irelia, Singed) or picking bursty gap closers against ranged (Jayce, Teemo). This requires some common knowledge and being able to visualize how a matchup will play out while still in champ select. The farther your opponent falls behind, the more likely that ganks will be focused on your lane, allowing your team to secure objectives without much resistance.
 

Occasionally, you will be last pick in champion select and by some miracle, you will be able to play top lane (which should be the case in every game, but you know, pick order &amp;gt; call order). In this position, you have the amazing chance to pick a champion that can abuse any weakness the other team might have. Don’t see a lot of cc? Grab Singed and just run through their whole team. An all AD team? Malphite is a great pick. They don’t have any hard initiates? Pick Jayce and poke their team without retaliation. There is almost always a champion that can both win top lane as well as tear apart the other team, so don’t pass up that opportunity!
 

**Conclusions**
 

I hope this analysis gives more insight as to what makes top lane and how to effectively pick a champion, regardless of your pick order. It’s important to note that picking a good champion is only part of the top lane experience, being able to play a champion to its most potential and picking a champion that compliments your team will ultimately decide whether you win or lose games.

1361286106.0,71,self.summonerschool,18tj0r,Tips for laning against Singed,Darktakashi,80,9,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18tj0r/tips_for_laning_against_singed/,"If you haven't seen my previous post http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18rovt/tips_for_laning_against_teemo/
I'm going to give you tips on how to lane against Singed (top lane)

* Make sure to get the Unyielding Mastery and 3 points into the Magic Resistance it's a MUST against Singed, since his poison ticks 3 times each second for 3 seconds you're saving yourself 6 magic damage taken, even though this doesn't sound a lot combined with the MR, Flat MR runes, the masteries, and a lot of health potions, this is pretty much going to make you immune to singed's insane damage.

* Shove Singed into his tower before he shoves you.  Singed has a hard time CSing because his Poison isn't that reliable until later levels, his flip will help him with this but it has a high mana cost, even at level 1 (100 mana) but this will stop him from running up to you and flipping you because it has a pretty nice base damage.  When you shove your lane into his tower make sure to not stand near him so he won't flip you into his tower taking free damage, free damage is the worst damage to take in lane!  Also buy a ward each time you back, his slow and fling make ganking his lane easy for his jungler so be safe!

* Harass Singed whenever you can, Singed is a melee champion who relies on walking up to someone to do damage, even if you are melee if one of your abilities can do damage while stopping him from using his poison on you (for example Malphite's Q) you can stop him from harassing you and he gets punished for trying to.  Another example is Darius Q it does physical damage and does magical damage (bleed) and also Darius' passive gives movement speed when someone is bleeding so you will get out of range for singed to use his flip.

* NEVER fight Singed when his ultimate is on, NEVER EVER EVER NEVER, it gives him too much stats, at level 1 it gives 35 Ability Power, Armor and MR, Health Regen and mana regen, and even movement speed (his favorite stat to walk up and kill you AS WELL AS CROWD CONTROL REDUCTION) and combined with ghost he's a skinny man that can run around the field catch the enemy and poison them all while taking barely any damage, in lane this can pretty hard to deal with but it has 100 second CD so make sure to remember that, he's mostly going to use his ultimate in lane to force you to hug under your tower while he farms between your towers, it's pretty much impossible to stop him, the best thing to do is clear the minions attacking your tower while he is farming your minions so you won't lose your tower before anything, he will come out with a lot of farm but it's better than giving 300g or 150g Global gold and also giving him access to your ally's jungle.

* NEVER CHASE SINGED (do I need to explain more?) I see countless ganks on singed where he just activates ult and Q and the jungler takes more damage than he did on Singed.  Never chased Singed either, it's impossible without a lot of gapcloser and ranged abilties.

* Punish him for roaming, Singeds love to roam after poisoning your lane, punish him by taking his tower away and pushing it to the next one if possible

* Make sure to counteract his spamming of laugh with your laugh, it will destroy his confidence in trolling you.

* Singed's Flip is the same range as his Melee Attacks, REMEMBER THIS WHEN HE DIVES YOU!, LOOP AROUND YOUR TOWER IF YOU CAN.(125 Range)

If you have any questions for singed or would like to see a post about tips for another champion you have trouble with feel free to ask (my next post is possibility going to be on kayle)

1357586357.0,73,self.summonerschool,164uhp,"Dear Summoner School Community, If you want to truly improve, please start to think for yourself.",SnowyField,87,14,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/164uhp/dear_summoner_school_community_if_you_want_to/,"I often lurk on Summoner School and sometimes, but rarely respond. My responses always start becoming long winded and are about the general opinion, but with my theory as to why that is the general opinion over another reason.

Summoner School Community is an interesting place to seek help in League. With a wide range of skill level, the community helps each other grow and get better at the game. A common interest in most of the community is to get better. With that being said, often many posts are what I consider almost facepalm worthy.

Many posts that are upvoted are centered around the Hivemind of league, or how pros build. Other opinions are often downvoted for simply disagreeing with them, but if there is one clear thing about this game I have learned from watching streams is that item build means jack-shit sometimes. Skill and judgement often trumps most anything in this game. You can build oddly, but adjust the way you play to make it work very effectively.

That being said the whole **Think** for yourself was to try and minimize the posts that seem almost unnecessary and often end with one basic reply copying a pro build and then the post is done. A while back I became good friends with a helper of Summoner School. He helped people get better at the game and taught them, but he never really was able to make an impact he felt. He taught people specific builds and play styles and they won using them. He tried and hoped to have them understand the different play styles with different builds, but he quickly gave up and just turned into making them machines and slaves to their build. They ""improved"" of course, but it really didn't help them in the long run. Both him and I knew that.

Flexibility is one of the great things of this game. From choice of champions, to choice in build order let alone build, to choices in game, everything will change how the game plays out. 

The problem I am trying to essentially get at is that to often posts are made stating ""optimal"" build for a specific champion but every game is different, every need of the team is different. Even the players on your team are often different and fulfill different roles based on how they play. Changing your static build order to try and full in the role that is missing in your comp becomes vastly important later. **LOOKING** at your *teammates items and enemy items* to figure out **WHY** things are occurring they way they are. Using that information and then understanding what adjustments must be made are things static build orders **always** lack. I have played many troll build games with my friends at 3 am (normals are crazy. We win them 80% of the time since one friend has like negative elo in normals).
where I would go ADC Soraka and an Ezreal Support. Even the enemy BOT LANE didn't notice Soraka was AD until about 20 minutes in when I had 7 kills. Our teammates didn't notice until bot said WOAH, Soraka is AD. Of course this is a normal, but the fact that it took 20 minutes to even look at what your enemy built let alone our team never figured it out until that post is just... BAD.

What I am hoping comes from this post, which I will probably edit later as it is quite disorganized (I'm a terrible writer),  is that posts won't get down-voted for being not in the ""hivemind"", posts won't be simply a 1 liner about build or ""optimal"" anything, and that we all sit down and think about WHY things are before we even make a post. Remember your posts effect the OPs way of playing from then on and maybe many more lurkers. At least put thought into it first.

My post is in reaction to seeing this post where some stated some things helpful and even with thinking, but this guy got down-voted for his opinion while never stating anything incorrect factually. http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/163gov/season_3_ezreal/c7sizer?context=3

1361940488.0,73,self.summonerschool,19b5b7,Low ELO Mechanics,arcitan,81,8,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19b5b7/low_elo_mechanics/,"Let me start by saying that I am by no means a highly-skilled player (Silver V represent!), but I believe that I have a fair understanding of the mechanics of LoL, and I'm just here to share some things that I have noticed and learned. 

* **INVADES:** I main jungle, and the first thing I do is assess whether my team has a better level 1 than the enemies', and see if we can pull off an early invade. But what irks me the most about trying to invade at my division is that most people don't walk around through mid lane to the bush; they use the autopath route which walks through the wraith tri-path and, if the enemy was in the banana bush by blue buff, could possibly give away vision of themselves and compromise the invade. Moral of the story here is **DON'T TRUST AUTOPATH!** It's always preferable to move your champ by yourself instead of relying on autopath, because while it may give you a good route 80% of the time, the other 20% you'll be walking right into your grey screen and death timer. Also, be sure you have your priorities straight when you're invading. An invade is to **steal the enemy buffs and deny their jungler, not secure FB. That's an added bonus, not the main goal**. The correct way to do this is either to walk from lane into river brush and not wraiths over to river. This only applies for blue invade. The second route is to walk through tribush in either top or bot, and then move down at 1:40. This ensures they have no view on you due to the help they get on wolves / wraiths and you can catch them inside the blue / red buff brush. If done correctly this will hand you a firstblood, possibly a double kill and the blue / red buff. Invading just because you want to invade to fish a firstblood is doomed to either give away a first blood or to get it at a much higher risk. Get caught trying to invade and you might already lose the laning phase (thanks to rubaduck for this!). 

* **LANING:** I'm sure you've all read this before, but always **prioritise farm over harass**. It's not worth getting a Q off on the enemy Irelia when you've just missed 3 caster minions. That's a potential 75G right down the drain, all for a hundred damage that Irelia can easily heal back up on. However, don't just focus entirely on farming as well. Try and find the perfect medium between the two, and while it's not optimal to give up last hits for harass, it's probably better to give up on a few last hits if your jungler is coming in for a gank and you know it will be successful. 

* **GANKS:** Too often I'll walk up to gank a lane, and my lane won't know what to do when I'm there. The first thing you should know about ganks is that **communication is key**. My key rule whenever I gank or am recieving a gank is to ping the enemy once to signify that he is the target, ping a second time after to signify that I'm in position, then ping a third time to signal to go in. When you're a laner, typically you'll be initiating the gank to try and bait the enemy into a fight with you. However, don't be too aggressive all of a sudden when your jungler shows up if you usually play passive in lane; **act natural when you're about to be ganked.** While you can usually get away with this at lower ELOs and bait the enemy into an engagement with you, as you play with higher skilled players they will realize that your jungler is nearby and withdraw. This is one of the reasons that Reginald is considered such a dangerous laner; he always plays aggressively as if TheOddOne is always nearby so the enemy mid doesn't know if he actually is or not. This little mind game is how you should be treating your enemy laner when your jungler comes for a gaink. Basically, keep your style of laning consistant when your jungler comes for a gank, you don't to give away that he's nearby. 

* **DON'T ACT, REACT:** This is pretty much the key rule of Solo Queue. Just by remembering this key concept, you'll find that you'll win lane a lot more, and most likely even games. This applies especially to low ELOs, since mistakes are a lot more prominate in those games. Basically, this means that you should be **reacting to your enemy's mistakes.** Capitalise on your enemy's mistakes, because I'm sure they will make some. Everyone wants to be the guy making ""the plays"", but if you mess up you could throw big time. Instead, try and make plays based on your enemy's failed ones, if that makes sense. 

* **FORCE OBJECTIVES IF YOU'RE AHEAD:** No, stalemating a poke war midlane for 10 minutes is not forcing an objective. Rolling as a team to take dragon after you've taken mid tower and killed someone on the enemy team is taking objectives. Always try and have your team up and around and doing something if you're ahead; don't just farm/poke around midlane. I've seen this happen too many times, and I've seen games lost where a team had a HUGE advantage. This is the time where you make the enemy team have to react to your actions, and if they try and fight you they will most likely lose, since your team will be ahead. Force dragon fights, contest towers, buffs; anything but the dreaded poke war mid. 

If you've made it this far, I thank you for reading my massive wall of text :D. Let me know if I've missed anything, or if I'm incorrect in any  way. I'm looking to improve as well, and I just wanted to list out what I've observed and learned. Once again, I'm not by any means an amazing League player, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. 

EDIT: Added some more to the LANING and INVADE sections. Thanks to rubaduck and Ebonyknife for the information added, and for everyone else so far to give any feedback! :)

* Check your emotions at the door.

I shouldn't say all emotions but mostly negative ones. Most times, I find the difference between an inconsistent player and a player that always plays well boils down to mindset. If you're calm, relaxed or just happy, you play better. Simple. But if your already upset, mad, fusterated or generally in a fowl mood, playing LoL isn't the key to relaxing, it only makes things worse. It happens to me, my friends, my teammates, it happens to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to get your mind straight before you hop online. Getting crushed will make your day even worse.

* The key to getting better is learning how to not die

If a pro or high elo player played with you at your elo and has a good game, let's say he goes 12-0. Most people would say ""He got 12 kills! That's why he did so good!"" Kind of but not really.  He's probably good at his skillshots and such but i think it's more that he's good at preventing himself from dying. It keeps less gold out of the other teams pocket, making you even stronger in comparison. If you trade kills in lane in mid, no one's getting an advantage (besides creeps but i'll talk about that later). But if you manage to kill him without someone killing you, it makes it easier for you to do it again next time. 

Kills aren't everything.

A kill getting away isn't the end of world and actually has it's set of advantages as well. Being out of lane means less creeps. less creeps = less gold + less xp= weaker opponent. If you have some sort of long range skill or he's in a position where you can easily hit him, do it just to stop his recall. The longer you delay him, the more creeps he'll miss. And if you can get a kill out it, even better. But your not feeling confident, letting him go is usually the best decision.

And lastly, if you're looking for a fight or kill, make SURE you can finish it! Be at least 90% sure you can land that stun or snare or whatever you need to finish the job. Because if you end up dying for it, it's not worth it. Also, try to avoid doing so with less than 400 or so health. Expecting to burst someone down and being bursted down in the process is a very real possibility.


* LEARN TO LAST HIT

Everyone on reddit and guides everywhere says this, I know but this simply can't be understated. Farming is VERY important in this game. Honestly, I haven't exactly mastered this yet either (I jungle most of my games instead of laning) but if you're a newer player, learning to last hit as soon as possible will accelerate your play by leaps and bounds.

12 CS is about equal to one kill in gold. With that knowledge in mind, it's VERY important to get as many as possible. If you're laning against someone and you have 65 CS more than who your laning against , that's means you're about 5 kills ahead of your opponent and about equal to 1600 gold which is an extra BF sword or Needlessly large rod. That's a giant advantage. And we all know how much an extra item helps out.

I'm sure there are more comprehensive farming guides but here's a few tips:

   - Pay attention to the minion aggro. Aim for the one minion that's losing health faster than the rest and hit it right before it dies. The more you practice, the better you'll get at it.

   - Don't attack the creeps constantly! There's several reasons but the biggest one is it helps you from missing CS. That's why its called ""Last hitting"", getting the last hit before it dies. To prevent this, most people move back and forth in random directions to prevent your champ from hitting minions you don't want it to. You can also just press the S key to stop in place or cancel your attack animation.

   - Masteries have a big part. Carries have a bit of a easier time last hitting without abilities but mages can have a rough time. But whoever I play, I always grab the extra 4 damage to minions and creeps, and one or two extra AD in the offense tree. If you're a mage, grabbing 4 extra AP wont benefit you as much. 4 AP doesn't even equal 4 damage in most cases.

* If you're ahead, don't play stupidly.

""OMG THEY FED ME SO HARD LOL. 7-0 AS DARIUS, IM UNSTOPPABLE. IMMA GO TRY TO SOLO THE TEAM NOW.""

Then you die. and you die again. and you die again. Before you know it your 7-8, they baroned and you have 2 inhibs down. They all push together, your team is overwhelmed, then you lose.Afterwards, you get that ""egg on your face"" feeling where you let that game slip through your fingers. I see this happen a lot and it even happens to me sometimes.

If you're ahead, it's okay to abuse your advantage, feign pressure, force the other team into unfavorable positions but remember, you're not invincible. Most times, if the other team sets it up right, you can easily be put in a position where you can be killed and that's all it takes to turn the tide of a game. At that point, YOUR mistakes determine the fate of the game. Since you're so powerful, you have the most influence on how it progresses, so make sure it stays in your favor.

* and lastly, just try to have fun!

That's what gaming is all about right? Don't beat yourself up too much about a loss or tell yourself you're bad and you'll never get good at this game. That's the first step to quitting, and if you quit, you DEFINITELY won't get any better. Like I said, a large amount of your play comes from mindset. Respect others, respect yourself, try to ignore any trolls or bad mannered players, and you'll have a better time playing. And it's usually easier to learn this way as well. Don't take it so seriously, you have all the time in the world to get better at this game. 

I hope this helps some people out there. I know this is kind of lengthy despite me saying it's gonna be short (this took me about an hour to write) and there's A LOT more i didn't talk about when it comes to more advanced tactics and such. But these are the basic mechanics most people should focus on.

__________________________________________________________


##Lesson Details &amp; Explanations (Optional Read)


This video's primary focus was ""openings""


So what is an opening? An opening in its most basic form is the spending of a base funding, in League of Legends that means how do you spend your initial 475g. I created a list of potential openings and decided to share some of them. I listed them by base price from lowest to greatest.
__________________________________________________________


##Openings  

Quick note, the amount of health and mana potions can be shifted as they cost the same amount of gold. DISCLAIMER! THESE OPENINGS ARE JUST SUGGESTIONS SO DON'T POST SAYING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE USED. If you want you can suggest your own and I'll put it in here and if a certain opening gets disliked to an extreme I will take it off the list.


##Bead 6 Pot, or Bead 6  


[](/rejuvenationbead) + [](/healthpotion) **X5** + [](/manapotion) **X1** + [](/sightward)  


This opening is a standard start which maximizes HP Regen to survive in lane and keeps your lane warded for 3 minutes of the laning phase which is long enough to keep a decent CS Score. This can be used defensively and aggressively as demonstrated in the video but is usually used as a defensive start to build into tanky items. Take this opening path if you feel threatened by your opponent and can make use of the reju bead upgrades.  

##Charm Caster  


[](/faeriecharm) + [](/healthpotion) **X4** + [](/manapotion) **X2** + [](/sightward)  

This build was simply suggested as a mana focused version of Bead 6 but it is much more than that, the Faire Charm does more than just give mana regen, it builds into several important CDR and Mana Regen items and provides a completely different build path then that of Bead 6. This build is great for any mana users that use one of the charm upgrades and is very low risk with a sight ward in inventory.  

##Cloth 5  


[](/clotharmor) + [](/healthpotion) **X5**  

The best defense is the best offence, but you should be careful with this build, even if this build nullifies the damage output of some AD champions you are taking this build because of the fear of death. This build path is taken when your champion simply cannot duel the enemy champion in lane until your 6 or other form of burst. This is a very defensive start and should only be used aggressively if you are aware of the enemy junglers location. This opening can easily go south without the additional ward that bead 6 provides. If the enemy AD has consistent AD damage output take this instead of bead 6 because health regen won't matter if you die before it is applied, sometimes it's better to just wear the nerf pads :)  

##Null &amp; Void  


[](/nullmagicmantle) + [](/healthpotion) **X2**  

This one is very similar to Cloth 5 in regards to consistent damage. If the enemy can do significant amounts of magic damage early then this can really tone down the trades in lane. Teemo, Elise, and Singed are the biggest offenders in this case and it can help the entire laning phase if you have some form of MR to deal with their pesky insta trade abilities -_-  

##Long Sword vs Doran's Blade  

Probably the most debated thing in the AD community is which one to take and when, and the answer isn't simple which is why I kinda threw a curve ball with my answer in the video but I can explain it here. Doran's Blade gives Health, AD, and Life Steal in the form of an on hit effect, what does that mean? That means you need to auto attack minions in order activate the on hit hp regen, and you will get the most use out of it by auto attacking as much as possible. This means you will be shoving the lanes showing aggression throughout most of the laning phase and your support will also need to be aggressive in some manner. It could be an aggressive pick such as Zyra, Thresh, or Leona or they can be vision aggressive by purchasing pink wards and negating enemy vision with something like ""Back To The Shadows"", either way your support needs to be able to defend you as you will most likely be shoving the wave at the enemy tower and simultaneously exposing yourself to ganks. A Long Sword start is effective in a sustain lane where your support can heal you and you want to rush an early Vampiric Scepter to obtain a BloodThirster or Bilgewater Cutglass for Blade of the Ruined King. You also have to think what kind of matchup are you going into, we will cover that in another post of just ADC and Support Matchups because 2v2 lanes are extremely dynamic.  
__________________________________________________________

Now obviously there are other starts such as Flask 3 Pot but I'm not going into every single one so try out some of your own and go experimenting in the Item Sets section of your profile, I want to move on to discussing what I do during the matches.
__________________________________________________________  

##Pressure Removal/Redirecting  

I'm sure you've all been in a game before where your lane was difficult to win and you want your jungler to gank for you since you are just flat out getting bullied by your opponent, but your jungler never comes... Not because he is bad or can't gank at that moment, he is stuck in another lane.  

That's what we want to accomplish with these openings, by starting with sustain or damage or an all in kill build you force the enemy jungler to make a choice. Help the lane, keep jungling, or answer back by attempting a gank in another lane. This choice isn't easy to make and usually a frustrated laner doesn't help the jungler with his case, so with that logic let's make their life hell. Do your best to pressure your enemy laner and force the jungler into your lane, understand that this is a risk and you shouldn't take this risk without proper vision control, but as long as you can safely pressure your enemy do so. If the jungler comes to gank you then that is good because you instantly remove pressure all around the map, no one needs to worry about the jungler coming into their lane until he is out of vision in your lane. 
__________________________________________________________  

##The Two Methods  

##Aggressive Method  
There isn't much to say here, being aggressive is simple, harrass and harrass over and over again until your enemy laner is scared to enter your lane. Be intimidating and be sure to press any advantage you have damage wise, you want to maximize your damage output as early as possible so the player on the other team is stuck there saying ""there isn't anything I can do about this (Insert Your Champ Here)"". Be sure to ward for ganks and keep the pressure up, remember if it comes down to CS and harass take the CS because that will always help where your harass can be health regen'd back. This comes down to learning matchups in your lane but again I will save that for the next video because there are so many dynamics to every lane matchup.  

##The Brick Wall Method
Imagine a very muscular person, now imagine a very flimsy person, now imagine both of them hitting a brick wall, what will happen? They both will end up in serious injury and that's the plan for our enemies, sometimes building defensive stats can be just as good as offensive stats. I demonstrate this in the Shen game play where Riven has a BF Sword and Doran's blade start and still can't even dent my HP bar, and not only that but I can out duel her without a single offensive stat in my runes, masteries or items.  

The way to win a defensive lane is mobility and defense, you become a counter engage or the reinforcements for your teams engages. I only would hit riven if she committed to hitting me and I maxed out my shield along with other defensive stats to pretty much be impossible to take down and that is key. The choice in the summoner spell teleport allowed me to leave my lane and immediately show presence top after roaming somewhere else on the map and it is my duty to roam and create pressure once riven leaves lane as there isn't much else you can do until the mid game where you can finally go toe to toe with anyone and usually, if you haven't died, win your trades.
__________________________________________________________  

##Hitting Tab

I can't stress enough how important the [Tab] button is, this lets you check the items of everyone in the game and can indicate the weakness in an enemies defense. The moment the Shen game started I check what my team builds and what the enemy builds the moment they are in vision. Simply hitting [Tab] gave me the advantage in the shen game and even allowed Master Yi to snowball by taking down the enemy jungler and stealing his buffs. Learn to count the gold spent in each opening. If a champion still has items worth over 400 gold in his inventory when he enters lane then there are NO WARDS! If you're not warding then you're not winning and that is the lesson you need to teach them, inform your jungler of the status of your lane at all times, after all he can't gank for you if he doesn't know where to go or come from. This can completely change the outcome of your lane and it takes about half a second to press and look at the purchases.

1354100872.0,72,self.summonerschool,13xg5a,Season 3 is approaching. Here's some tips for newcomers.,Diclonyuus,84,12,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/13xg5a/season_3_is_approaching_heres_some_tips_for/,"Hello, summoner students!
I'm a player who has been around the 1500/1600 range consistently and I'm here to give you a few tips for if you start ranked or want to play really well in normal games to maximize your performance!

1. Listen to relatively calm music. As a big dnb/metal fan, I noticed that when I actually listen to calmer things like lounge music or video game soundtracks, I am also a calmer player. If you are calm, you can make more rational decisions instead of letting the heat of the moment take over. That kind of decision is always better. [edit: this point is apparently not universally applicable. Still, doesn't hurt to give it a try - it did help me!]

2. Don't set ""I want to win this game"" as your goal. Sometimes, winning a game is out of reach, and it DOES happen. If you lose 10 games, but you win 11, you actually have an elo GAIN, but the 10 games will feel like hell if you weren't the primary losing factor. Try to set other things as your goal! ""I want to get at least 80 creeps per 10 minutes"" is a good example, or ""I want to give not a single kill to the jungler"". Combine these goals. If all your goals are in your own reach and not dependant on your team, you can lose a game and still smile. That also leads to:

3. Stay positive. The best reaction to someone who makes an offensive or provocative statement in your team is to tell them to calm down. Add friendly emoticons! If people see you are still positive even though they just made a huge mistake or were really unlucky, they might rethink it. Try to encourage your team. However, if you already did that, and they keep on raging, just put them on ignore and keep following the goals you set yourself earlier instead of trying to make this person calm down - some people just want to watch the queue burn.
&gt; If it ever happens that someone made you rage so hard that even after the game is over you are still annoyed, don't instantly queue for the next game. Ask yourself: ""How much will this matter next week?"" Browse reddit for a while, play a browser game, there's lots of possibilities to get your mind off that game. Don't queue if you are still annoyed.

4. Stay friendly to everyone, including the enemy team. I've been in plenty of situations where the guy who carried the blue team pitied the purple support who really played well, but still got bashed by their team. One of these situations became my duo queue and team buddy for the past two years.

Following that advice and staying positive is also a big part of carrying yourself out of ""elo hell"". I believe the only reason it is called like that is because of the psychological aspect needed to get out of there. I've seen plenty of players who play really well and would definitely be at a higher elo if they reached their best performance every game. However, disregarding especially #2 and #3 will make you underperform hugely!

I wish you the best of luck, summoners! Never forget that this is a game where you're supposed to have fun. In the end, nobody really cares about your elo, except maybe yourself.

1336419788.0,69,self.summonerschool,tbmtw,Playing For Objectives: Being a Stronger Team Player,MileyCyrusNo1Fan,76,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tbmtw/playing_for_objectives_being_a_stronger_team/,"Hello everyone!~ My name is Caleb ""Oskii"" Boese, or Oskjuvatn on the NA Server. I'm by no means an accomplished pro, or even do I consider myself a good player. I make a hell of a lot of stupid plays, and mistakes. But that's okay, because I'm still learning the game, as are you. What I'm here to discuss today is a fundamental aspect of League of Legends that seems to be oft overlooked. ""Playing for objectives"" or, in layman's terms: ""getting shit done.""


**The goal** in League of Legends is pretty simple: you want to blow up the other team's Nexus. Main objective. Priority numero uno. Unfortunately, you can't just bumrush the Nexus and take it out without overcoming a series of trials which you need to be strong enough to do. So we have smaller, important objectives which set us up for this longterm goal. 


\#1 Objective in the laning phase is to **get stronger.** You do this through experience (which means levels) and items (which are bought with Gold). A secondary objective is to stop the enemy from getting as strong as you are: for example harassing to deny farm, etc. But keep in mind that *getting stronger yourself should always be #1* priority.


All your other objectives in the game eventually lead into your #1 priority. Towers, dragons, baron, buffs, etc all lead to that essential **""items and experience""** goal that will translate into ""smashing the nexus.""


Now, here's the problem with the game at lower levels: many of the games are won through laning phase. Blue team's AD Carry is 40 cs up on Purple Team's AD Carry because Purple Team's AD Carry is primarily a jungler and doesn't much know how to CS as well as he should. Purple's jungler is making sick plays because he's got a good vibe going on, but his toplaner is still drunk from lastnight so he can't focus and doesn't follow up on ganks. **This is how games are won and lost at my [and likely your] Elo.** 


**Imagine** a perfect game. Not a single CS is missed, and you're all building your core items quickly and efficiently. For the sake of the metaphor, let's pretend Graves and Corki as being the AD Carries, and being exactly the same all throughout the game. It's twenty minutes into the game, and they're both at their bench mark of 200 cs. They have their Infinity Edges and are working [and at the same point on] their Phantom Dancers. The same is true across all lanes. The teamfight comes and they all play perfectly. In this situation, in a vacuum everybody dies and neither team accrues any advantage. So you must look to **get things the other team can't have.** If blue team gets a Dragon, purple team can't take a Dragon to compensate for six minutes. Suddenly each member of blue team is up 190 gold. Graves is suddenly skyrocketed to being at 210~ cs, and Corki still has 200. And ONE dragon by 20 minutes isn't what you want. What if blue team had 2 dragons by this point? The team is, giving equal cs and no kills, 2k gold ahead. It's almost like EVERY MEMBER of the blue team has killed an extra 20 minions. 


This is where WORKING AS A TEAM and SECURING OBJECTIVES becomes a **huge deal**. If you've managed to steal the Enemy's first red buff, and the next two blue buffs as well as getting three dragons in a row, it doesn't matter that your AD Carry is a bit weaker than theirs. Sure, he might be 20 cs down and have died once. Their midlaner has been without two blues which should have given your midlaner the opportunity to *run train on him,* as well as everyone on your team getting around *570 gold from the Dragons.* Their jungler and mid are down experience from the stolen buffs, and your whole team is in a better spot. Suddenly, your AD Carry has his Infinity Edge and theirs is stuck at BF/Pickaxe. This is when you can comfortably start to *press your advantage* into taking *more objectives* with less of a clear-cut opportunity. In the early-game, you might need to have bottom lane ganked, kill one of their bottom laners, and have your top with teleport ready to secure a Dragon, but if you're in a position to be ahead enough that you could challenge the other team 5v5 while fighting dragon then maybe you should be taking those objectives. 


There are too many times in the lower Elo brackets where one team will push the first tower, start grouping and then **never do anything** while the other team catches up. Be aware of the lanes, if bottom is pushing to second turret and the wave is massive, someone from their team is going to HAVE to clear it, so you should be doing an objective whenever the opportunity arises. I've been in games where people are SO UNSURE of when to do objectives like Baron that they wait an entire minute before deciding whether or not to do it. If you see their AD Carry botlane and your whole team is in position to Baron, why aren't you doing it already? Too often I'll call a Baron, and have my whole team derp around for 45 seconds, and then start the Baron and we get aced. I'm immediately blamed for calling the Baron, even though we nearly completed it and if we'd started 45 seconds earlier it'd be an easy, free objective.


Another point: **DO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE CALLS** in ranked, but especially in Normal Games, of all places. I play in Skype with a group of friends and I'm an *extremely* vocal person. I consider myself a Leader rather than a follower, so I'm often spitting out decisions/calls. We were playing Normal Draft and we were positioning for Baron. Two enemies were in reasonable range. No one was doing anything. I waited for them to get a little too close, pinged about 5 times and screamed ""KILL 'EM"" into Skype. We slaughtered them in no time flat and got a free Baron, proceeding to win the game. The other side of the coin, many a time I've made stupid decisions. I've said ""let's dragon now, come on, come on!"" only to get slaughtered and give up the Dragon. I admit it. I've fucked up. The point is: **a good Leader is not necessarily the one who always makes the correct decision, but the one who always makes a fast decision. Making quick consistent decisions is the first step to becoming a great leader, the next is developing your knowledge and consistently making good calls.** 

*CLG is a terrible anti-example of this.* Just the other day I was watching them play 5s and Saint was trying to make calls. He kept yelling ""push top, push top!"" while HotShotGG and Doublelift constantly rebutted thinking it was a bad idea. League of Legends is a flexible game, you can make small mistakes and still come out ahead, it's **when you contradict each other's paths of action that you're going to get fucked.** If there's one thing I could say to CLG it would be ""for once, just listen to every call Saintvicious makes. Never dispute it. Just do it. For an entire game. Let Saintvicious be the voice of the team. If he says: ""HotShot, come push top with me."" HotShot better get his ass top and start pushing. If he makes a bad call, you wait for the next call and follow it, too. After the game, *evaluate how it went.* Realize what might not have been the perfect call and see why. Everyone gains some sense of the game ""Hey, you know, maybe calling that Baron when x was y and z still had his ultimate up when they were in this position-- etc."" Keep in mind, I'm not saying ""Make Saint leader and follow his every word,"" I'm suggesting him as a starting point because he's vocal and is willing to make calls. If it fails and the team agrees Saintvicious can't consistently make professional calls, then try Chauster, or Jiji, or HotShot, or Doublelift. Somebody. Figure out who's got that vibe. **In a team game, you really all need to be on the same page, and until you have a unified thought process it's going to be a clusterfuck.**


Which brings me around to my next point: ""But Oskii, there's absolutely no way you can get this kind of cooperation in SoloQ! Too many bad players, too many egotists, too many retards.""


You're right: there *are* bad players, there *are* egotists, there *are* retards. *Trolls*, too. And **lots** of them. The point is, until you're trying every single thing you can do to make your team win, you're **not** going to get out of ""Elo hell.""


Here's how I see it: Getting out of ""Elo hell"" is a whole lot like laning phase farming in League of Legends. Each wave there are *six* creeps [siege minions excluded for now]. Hardly ever does anyone get all six, every time, with another laner there who's stopping you from getting some. Maybe you've got a Stun-proc'd Annie at level six and she's terrifying. So you might **only have the opportunity to get four of those six creeps.** Two are *inevitably lost*, because Annie will blow you up if you try to go near them. At all Elos, **there are creeps you COULD have CS'd**, but either due to bad timing or not paying attention or some horrible demon possessed you, **you missed them.** Say you blanked and missed two of those CS. You got 2 out of 6 on the wave: *not* good. You should've had 4. It's the same way with playing ranked games. **You have six games, two of which could possibly be uncarriable, but until you get EVERY CS you CAN get, ie. win ALL the games that ARE carriable, you will stay in ""Elo hell.""** You need to win those 4 to move upward. If you don't win those 4, you're either staying the same or falling downwards because you're losing regular games **and** games that aren't your fault.


**You're only one person**: you only comprise *20% of the team.* That's not a majority. You do not have the benefit of a pre-made professional team who can elect a leader. You are all in purgatory together, and pretty much each and every one of you wants to get out. When you have five people who each have to rely on other people to determine their own fate: things can get ugly. Nearly every game in SoloQ is an example of this, whether on your team or the other, someone is pissed at someone else for ""throwing"" and determining their fate. People **don't like to give up control**.


So what do you do, then? How do you make a gameplan? You do your best. You get so damn good at what you do that you earn the SoloQ trust. When I played Cassiopeia from 1000~ elo up, I'd firstblood the enemy laner, end up with 3-4 kills by the time I got my first blue buff, the constantly go bottom/top and secure kills. My AD Carry trusted me because I'd gotten him a double kill, and he knew it. Top liked me because I counter ganked and gave him an assist and a kill. Hell, I even kept wards up at all times and called my MIAs diligently even though I try to watch the map and not rely on people calling them. After about 10 minutes of showing people that you're reliable, and a strong player, you should [without being pretentious] be able to start making calls, politely. Most people have a sense of how the game works, so if you get a kill bottom and your toplaner is getting ganked by the jungler, you call the Dragon and people will go ""Yeah! Good idea. I thought of that one too. Go me!"" And they'll DO it. I gained 300 Elo in two weeks with this mentality. I'm still rising. I expect to hit 1400 soon. Then 1500. I want to be good at this game, and so do you. Why else would you be here? So **take these words and use them as you will.** 


I wish you all the best in your endeavours and hope to see you on the Fields of Justice soon!~

A few times since the ReferAFriend2.0 released, we have people linking to their referral here. The mods have discussed this, and decided that this is not behaviour we want to promote. Somebody shouldn't have to grind an account to 5 for a lesson, or do it as a thank you. It goes against the principles we started this school with. 
  
As such, the mods will be removing any post that contains a referral link, or asks for people to give referrals. I don't care if you are giving something away. If somebody offers to give you a referral, fine, but thats a little different, and send the link in a private message. 

These posts will be marked as spam, and after 2-3 spam messages, the already over-active reddit spam filter will pretty much block everything you submit automagically. 

If anybody spots one of these links, reporting the post is the fastest way of alerting the mods. 

I could have very easily put my own referral link in the sidebar, and could have been racking them up as we speak. But I decided it would be a bad idea, and would send the wrong message to the community. I decided it fell into the same category as asking to be paid for teaching.

Be open minded when considering the needs of your team. If you’re the last one to pick, try to fill a niche in your team that hasn’t already been filled. If everyone’s picked and something stands out as a deficiency in your team composition, try asking for another player to fill the gap, or change roles to embrace that responsibility yourself. Remember, that by taking on a role you don’t normally play, you’ll learn more about unfamiliar champions and increase your own skill level.

Anyways, today's tip on Jungling is:

 * When ganking as the jungler, and you're waiting in a bush, e.g. Top Double bushes, Bottom Double bushes, Mid bushes, etc., one of the ideal times to gank is when the enemy laner uses one of his/her primary abilities to either farm or poke. This also applies to when the enemy has one of his/her Summoner Spells down on CD. Remember, timing is important in jungling, but being patient is even more important!

I operate a Youtube channel that has many videos on it all dedicated to helping you improve as a player- champion guides, game commentaries and analysis (from all roles, not just Jungle), Q&amp;A videos, thoughts on patch notes, short 'quick tip' videos, and more. 

I hope this post doesn't violate the rules as an 'advertisement'- I'm not here to promote my channel, but I thought I could offer some help to you guys in general. Now that I've discovered this place, I'll be sure to frequent it often. 

Feel free to ask me anything. I'm EXTREMELY interactive with my viewers/subscribers/anyone in general and I always answer questions that people send me. You can PM me on here, message me on Youtube, e-mail me, or leave a comment on a video (I prefer the latter, because that way people get to see the question/answer rather than it be a private 'discussion').

I'm sure I have something to help you guys. That's the goal of my channel after all, and I invest a lot of time in to doing it.

1. Early game effectiveness
2. Mid / late game scaling (ensuring you get there safely and are effective when you get there)
3. Stacking stats that are realistically beneficial to your champion 
4. Using runes efficiently 

I'm sure most of you know about basic rune pages, so instead of saying here's what runes to take on what champion, I'm going to list a few of my rune pages and how they apply to different situations. Having a library of organized pages can be extremely beneficial in almost any situation.


__________________________________

**Phys [General]**

*(9x) AD Reds* -- 8.5 flat AD

*(9x) Hp/lvl Yellows* -- 175hp at lvl 18

*(9x) Mr/lvl Blues* -- 24mr at lvl 18

*(3x) Armor Quints* -- 13 flat Armor


This page is my ""I don't know who I'm facing / it's blind pick / I want to be beefy late game"" page for AD.  It's the most efficient way to get bonus HP and still get 13 armor (the same if you were using armor yellows). Prevents squishy ad's from getting blown up right away late game. Also useful for champions that scale well with HP.

**Works well on:** Volibear (top), Udyr (top), Graves (any ADC really), Jax, Nidalee, Draius, etc. 

__________________________________

**Phys [Normal]** 

*(9x) AD Reds* -- 8.5 flat AD

*(9x) Armor Yellows* -- 13 flat Armor

*(9x) MR Blues* -- 12 flat MR

*(3x) AD Quints* -- 6.8 flat AD


Everyone should have this page. Everyone. Period. End of discussion. Bum standard on any AD carry. Run this page if you have any doubts.

**Works well on:** AD carries, High scaling AD champions (Riven, Kha' Zix)


__________________________________

**Phys [ArPen]**

*(6x) ArPen Reds, (3x) AD reds* -- 10 flat ArPen, 3 flat AD

*(9x) Armor Yellows* -- 13 flat Armor

*(9x) MR Blues* -- 12 flat MR

*(3x) AD Quints* -- 6.8 flat AD


This is for a more aggressive early / mid game, where your champion has high base physical damage on his / her abilities. The perfect example of this is Graves. Not only will your buckshot do more damage at all levels, but it will do less damage to minions because minions have negligible armor early. (push the lane less!) When you run this page, you should be sure that you will be able to get a kill between level 6 and 10. This page will snowball you like crazy. If you have 2 Dorans + this page vs 2 Dorans on the normal AD page, you will do significantly more damage.

**Works well on:** Aggressive AD carries (Graves, MF, Draven), AD Casters (Talon, Kha' Zix, Pantheon), AD Junglers (Nocturne, Skarner), AD top laners (Riven, Wukong) etc.

**Jungle [General]**

*(9x) AS Reds* -- 15% flat AS

*(9x) Hp/lvl Yellows* -- 175hp at lvl 18

*(9x) Mr/lvl Blues* -- 24mr at lvl 18

*(3x) Armor Quints* -- 13 flat Armor

This page, along with my Phys [General], is stacking up to being close to one of my most used pages. I really like the bonus health and tankyness you gain late game. I sometimes use this page on Irelia top lane as well, depending on the match up.

**Works well on:** Skarner, Udyr, Nautilus, Irelia, Shen, Nunu

**Jungle [Fast]**

*(9x) AS Reds* -- 15% flat AS

*(9x) Armor Yellows* -- 13 flat Armor

*(9x) Mr/lvl Blues* -- 24mr at lvl 18

*(3x) Movement speed Quints* -- 4.5% flat Movement Speed

Pretty standard here as well. Not really much to say. I take this when I want MS instead of bonus HP.

**Works well on:** ^ Same as above

*(9x) Armor Yellows* -- 13 flat Armor

*(9x) Mr/lvl Blues* -- 24mr at lvl 18

*(3x) GP/10 Quints* -- 3.0 GP/10 income

Not much to say, but people underestimate GP/10 (on runes at least) in the jungle. Great for times when you get counter jungled, also just really good in general. I take this when I don't want MS or HP.

**Works well on:** ^ Same as above

__________________________________

**Magic [Normal]**

*(9x) Magic Pen Reds* -- 9 flat Magic Pen

*(9x) Mana Regen /lvl Yellows* -- 11 Mana Regen at lvl 18

*(9x) MR Blues* -- 12 flat MR

*(3x) AP Quints* -- 15 flat AP

Everyone should have some variation of this page as well. I believe the Mana Regen yellows become more effective at level 7 than flat ones, so if you can wait that long, get these. I think they are superior in almost every way to flats, because you can pretty much just build 1 Mana item and that's all you need late game. Especially good if you build Athene's.

**Works well on:** Any AP that uses Mana and is played mid. That's about it.

**Magic [Fast]**

*(9x) Magic Pen Reds* -- 9 flat Magic Pen

*(9x) Armor Yellows OR (9x) Armor/lvl Yellows OR (9x) HP/lvl yellows*

*(9x) MR Blues* -- 12 flat MR

*(3x) Movement Speed Quints* -- 4.5% flat MS

I use this page for Kat, Ryze, Singed, etc. What yellows you use is completely up to you, just make sure you know what you're doing. The safest by far are Armor yellows. I use AR/lvl on Kat and Ryze because I'm confident with my play style on those two champions. AR/lvl effectively doubles your bonus armor at level 18 from runes alone.

Also pretty good on champions that often build chalice, for example, Veigar or Orianna.

**Works well on:** AP's that don't use / need Mana Regen, Kat, Ryze, Singed, etc.

**Support [Gold]**

*(9x) GP/10 Yellows* -- 2.25 GP/10 income

*(9x) Armor Blues* -- 6.3 flat armor

*(3x) GP/10 Quints* -- 3.0 GP/10 income

I'm no support master, but this is my go to page for support. Gives you a free GP/10 item at level 1. Lots of armor too. There are many variations on this page, but this one is good enough for me because I don't play support to much. But when I do, it's Taric or Blitz so this suffices.

**Works well on:** Any support. Trade some armor for MR if you want, but I'm lazy so I don't. Doesn't matter too much.

**Other tips that may be useful:**

1. Swapping out AD quints for flat HP Regen/5 Quints is effective top lane for harder match ups (Yorick :o ) I really like doing this on Jax and Riven, as well as Irelia.

2. Flat MR is useful vs a high magic damage lane, but is less useful in the Jungle or in an AD lane. Take MR/lvl when you feel comfortable doing so, it makes you more tanky mid and late game.

3. ArPen is usually* better in the jungle. You get guaranteed CS, and you're more likely to build tanky so you will rely less on your scaling and more on your base damage. ArPen facilitates this. Imagine a nocturne with 25 ArPen, wriggles, and a couple tank items. Pretty scary.

4. Be weary of unreliable runes. Unreliable you say? Think about Spell vamp and Lifesteal Quints - you have to be constantly attacking in order to benefit from these. If you are in a situation where you can't attack (zoned) these are useless. HP Regen/5 are much better in that situation. I'm not saying they are bad, but just be aware of the downsides.

5. Flat HP quints are worthless. If you want to be tankyer take 2 AR quint and 1 MR quint. 78 HP doesn't do much for anyone.

By using lolnexus, you will automatically develop a different mindset for the game. For example, if you notice how the enemy team is higher ranked, you will probably play more passive and have already given up slightly. (""Oh, they're better, we will lose...etc"") And same with the other way around; if you're team has a higher rating, you will think the game will be won more easily.

No matter how slight the feeling, it can dramatically change your attitude towards that specific game.

1371274671.0,65,self.summonerschool,1gdxob,The Solo Queue Playbook: Simple Strategies for Success; part 2 (early laning phase),BlueNoseReindeer,76,11,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gdxob/the_solo_queue_playbook_simple_strategies_for/,"Yesterday I talked about [L1 strats] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g81my/the_solo_queue_playbook_simple_strategies_for/) which can help your team get off on the right foot, although that's all they can do (I had a game today where we went 4-0 + summoners in a L1 engage, and ended up losing). Today I'd like to talk about the next step, the early laning phase, levels 1-5.

**During the early laning phase the most important person is the jungler.** Simply put, the jungler can create 2v1s or 3v2s at any point in time. As such, map awareness (knowing where junglers are at so you can aggress accordingly) and warding (to win the gank war) are essential during this phase. How each team uses their jungler and reacts to the enemy's jungler are usually the biggest factors. So, you need to understand how each jungler works.

* **Usually** Non-Mainstream junglers like Yi, Ez, and Trynd, are rare because they lack early ganking potential unless their enemy is seriously mispositioned. If you have one of these junglers on your team, odds are early ganks aren't going to be successful unless the enemy is pushing hard without ward coverage.

* Snowbally Assassin Junglers like Shaco and Lee Sin, who are known for early ganks should be feared from the very start. If you have someone who can gank comfortably from level 2, odds are they will gank you right away, you should be prepared.

* General junglers, like Amumu, Naut, and Sej usually look to start ganking around level 3-4 to gank. Make sure you know how each jungler's ganks work so that you can best avoid them.

These are general outlines to give you some context of when junglers hit power levels if you hadn't thought about it before, but **every jungling champion is unique and must be assessed individually, as well as every jungling summoner.** For example, I will almost always wait until level 4 to get my Nautilus hook when I am jungling, but many people will get it at Level 3, and some may even get it at level 2, depending on how much they want to force a gank.

Don't assume that just because you're going against an Amumu that he wont gank until he hits 4 (AKA: you should probably still get wards); if he can get a good gank off at L2 or L3 that will snowball a lane he's done his job, and investing a skill point in bandage toss will be worth. So what use is knowing that Amumu is weaker earlier than Shaco if you still have to ward? For one thing you can push harder, since warding against Shaco doesn't guarantee safety due to his stealth. For another thing, you can bait out early ganks/wasting time by playing *slightly* more passive. A Lee Sin walking through a ward means you should probably back off immediately (if he has flash he has 3 gapclosers, CC, AND strong burst even at L2 (if he started red), and that's not even considering his teammate(s) in the lane. A Malphite at L2 is significantly less imposing, and if you can get him to waste time thinking a gank opportunity will come up, or bait him into coming in when you are able to disengage (probably causing him to invest a point in his slow, which will increase his clear times) it will be a minor victory for you.

On the same note, depending on your lane opponent(s) and the jungler, it may be worth it to invest in defensive/escape abilities earlier when you know you are facing a strong early jungler, because if you can foil their plans early, you will (generally) be able to handle them easily late. For example, as Morgana Mid if my lane is pushing early I may get my shield at L2 or L3 instead of L4 like I prefer to, because I know without it I'm a death waiting to happen. The more factors there are to increase the success of a gank on me (factors like strength of the jungler currently, easy setup from lane opponent, and vision control) the more likely I am to invest in my shield when it comes times to allocate the skill point.

The summoner spell teleport, as well global ultimates are hugely important factors to keep in mind, but these have very little relevance in the early laning phase, so I'll wait to discuss them in my next article.

Okay, there is some general advice that should help you set up good ganks, as well as avoid good ganks. Now to specific plays.

1. **The Simple Gank.** Jungler gets in position, laner(s) initiate, jungler swoops in and gets kill/summoners/both. The biggest problem with this is that oftentimes laners don't see their junglers, and don't set something up, so the jungler goes in without a setup and the gank fails. As a jungler, ping to let your teammate know you are there, it makes all the difference. As a laner, let your jungler know **ahead of time** to ping when he gets near, especially if this is a common problem for you (like it used to be for me). The second biggest problem with the simple gank is that sometimes it's not possible for some reason (e.g. the lane is pushed), and the jungler will just waste their time waiting for a gank that will never happen. As a jungler, set a limit on yourself for how long you will stay for a potential gank. As a laner, if you know you can't (or just don't want to) set up a gank, ping the jungler back. If you're ganks aren't working out, one of these two things is probably why. As for when it is optimal to gank, I could write a whole article on that, if you would like that, let me know. One mistake I see even in mid-Platinum is that when ganking botlane, the gankers will focus completely on the ADC. **When you gank, focus the person with the least escapes,** focusing an ADC during laning phase has no real advantage (ADCs don't do that much more damage than supports at this point), unless they are just easier to pick off, and will often lead to sub-par and even downright horrible results (Sona will kite you rather viciously at early levels). Of course, if the lane is going so badly that the laners can't survive the fight that will ensue from a gank, odds are it will be a waste of your time to be there in the first place.

2. **The Countergank.** One laner knows a gank is coming, and sets up a trap, usually with their jungler and/or tower. Obviously, this requires wards, and almost always requires a nearby ally (or global ult) that the enemy doesn't bring into their calculations. The key in counterganking is to anticipate their actions, and have your response ready. If you're Ez/Nami/Amumu against a Draven/Leona/Sej, you know that they will initiate with Draven's knock, Leona's pull, or Sej's dive. If you get hit by all of these things your counter won't go well (because you're dead), but if you don't get hit by any you won't be in the best position to countergank them, and mayhem from uncoordination (e.g. Amumu dives their tower while Ez stays back to farm) has a high chance of occurring. Once you get hit initiated on, use your counter-initiate tools, in this case Nami's bubble and Amumu's bandage toss, most likely followed up by Ez's jump, and Nami heal/slowing shots/speedups, and of course everyone's damage dealing abilities. Fights this early are almost always contestable (Draven/Leona/Sej can still fight an Ez/Nami/Amumu countergank successfully, the element of surprise, a largely psychological edge, will be your only avantage, unless they get greedy and try to dive or soemthing), and anytime a fight will be close is no time to be stingy, use your summoner spells, get off as many autoattacks as you can, use every tool you can think of (minions? towers? terrain/brush?) or else your countergank can still be beaten. **As with regular ganks, focus whoever is easiest to kill, regardless of what position they are.** If you are the better scaling **team** 1 for 1s are worth it, otherwise they aren't.

3. **Counterjungling.** Counterjungler invades jungler's jungle, and tries to kill jungler and/or steal a buff. This is something to take into account during the first few minutes of the game depending on if there are any strong counterjunglers on either team (e.g. Nunu, Lee, Shaco), and at the 7:00 mark no matter what. The important thing to remember in counterjungling is that it isn't a one-man job. The team that is able to help their jungler faster will almost always come out on top of the engage, even if their jungler gets killed/loses a buff (e.g. if Nunu kills Naut, ending up with doublebuffs, but then dies to a laner, that laner will have doublebuffs, putting Naut's team ahead). With the high popularity of smiteless leashes, it is very easy with a ward to steal the first buff of a jungler with many champions, and many midplayers invest in an early ward to do so. What is significantly less common is to return at the 7:00 mark (a little earlier to ward is actually better) to take the first respawn of the buff. You know when it will be, and if you have vision it is an easy steal, potentially without even bringing your jungler (though not often). The important thing with a 7:00 counterjungle is to know where **everyone** on the enemy team is, especially their jungler. Solo lanes start hitting L6 around this time, so they are having a major powerspike, be very careful of them should a fight erupt. The game will most likely still be very close, so settle for small gains (probably just the buff unless you know it will be an easy kill as well) and don't go chasing deep for any reason. Also, if the jungler started blue buff, they will probably give it over to their mid, giving you exact information about where that person will be, potentially setting up an easy ambush before/after the buff transfer, depending on the matchup mid. The key with counterjungling is to not be greedy, settle for small gains at all stages, and **gradually** grow them into bigger leads.

4. **Sneaky Dragon.** This is a rare play, and I am running out of room in this post, so I won't say much about this except to keep ward coverage if possible, and if it is not possible then be highly aware of potential of the jungler to solo dragon (Nunu, Warwick, Nasus, and Shaco are a few who are very good at this) and keep track of the enemy botlane. If you think they are taking it, odds are you should fight them since dragon will weaken them substantially early on (and you can catch them between indecision and more indecision).

1341229602.0,66,self.summonerschool,vx52n,Some constructive criticism about Sunday Night Scrims,adaxus,71,5,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/vx52n/some_constructive_criticism_about_sunday_night/,"I'd like to start out by saying that I love the concept behind Sunday Night Scrims (SNS) and Summoner School.  The idea of helping new players learn about League of Legends and become better at the game through shared knowledge is a great thing, and I think you should most definitely keep that alive.

However, my issue here is with how SNS is run.  Your goal is ""to allow players (and viewers) to see how LoL is played at different Elo ranges/experience levels while providing **competent feedback and commentary**."" (taken directly from your reddit post)  As a first time SNS viewer, I was thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism showed on the stream last night by the casters and by the streamer.  It seemed like there was a lot of bashing of the players going on, rather than letting them try their own thing (e.g. Leona with Clarity).  Then there were times when some organization problems arose and the streamer went on a rage rampage.  Then, in game they were casting a fight, and one of the casters told the streamer to flat out ""shut up"" on stream rather than let him finish what he was talking about.  What really took the cake, though, is when a member of the community messaged the streamer and he responded with a ""go to urban dictionary and look up docking"".  Really?!  *Docking?!  On stream?!*  You're trying to cater to the newer players (some of which may be YOUNG) and you're going to chat about a sexual act like docking on screen?  How **unprofessional**.

I understand that the caveat to watching is that you don't have a ""filter"", but it's more than just cussing at this point.  It's a lack of basic professionalism that you should have when trying to broadcast an event towards an audience.  I also understand that I can't expect a pro-quality stream from SNS, being that it's still just an amateur competition run by some LoL enthusiasts.  Nonetheless, basic common courtesy should be somewhat adhered to by the shoutcasters.  Cussing isn't an isn't an issue.  ""That was fucking awesome, dude.  That Malphite ulted the shit out of that Viegar and made him his bitch!""  However, don't demoralize players, rage, etc. in a stream where your goal is to provide somewhat of a ""learning"" environment.  I'd like to also state that anything that Sunday Night Scrims does represents the Summoner School community as well, being that your competition is endorsed by them in the sidebar.

On the upside, the players involved showed great sportsmanship, even going so far as to apologize to the viewers for the pause in the game.  The competition as a whole is, once again, a great idea, and I see it having the possibility of becoming a great thing.  The things I listed above, though, are holding it back from reaching that great quality.  If I wanted to watch a stream like the one I saw last night, I'd rather watch some stream where everyone yells at each other and constantly tell eachother to ""fck off noob feeder i afk"".  However, I want to see it get better, so that's why I'm posting this here on /r/SS.  If I didn't care, I wouldn't do that.  This isn't a ""bash on SNS"" post, I assure you, it's a ""I care enough to tell you where you guys are lacking so that you can become a great program"" post.

------

I know some of you may have heard this before because i heard this tip a while back. I ignored it because no-one picked ashe because of her perceived low damage. When i saw her on free week i decided to give her a try ( i know shes only 450ip but i'm stingy).

I found she is incredibly good at improving my mechanics.

- Because you have an extra 50 range (most of the time) on your opponent it really encourages 'range leashing', otherwise known as always autoing at your max range.

- The q slow is really useful at improving your kiting skills, same with w.

- W is also great at keeping yourself out of danger in teamfights. You can just spam w from the outside untill it is safe to go in. This teaches you patience and when it is safe to start autoing in teamfights.

- E is a great awareness tool, it encourages you to scout the area before you farm somewhere. Its also a buffer for if your support doesn't ward, you can decide when you are in danger and get a few more seconds to push with the vision.

- Because your R is a global it forces you to have map awareness, its also great for learning how/when to set up ganks and all ins.

Also because ashe is quite easy to play mechanically you can focus on your adc mechanics, trading ,csing and your map awareness.

I feel i play much smarter and more aware when playing ashe.

I would recommend any player to play ashe for a few games before moving on to other adcs.

Also if you are rushing philo you put yourself behind on a sightstone rush. Sightstone (simplified) gives you 2 wards every 3 minutes so 50g/min, a lot more than philo. Finally when people are rushing philo they often start something like 3 wards faerie charm/rejuv bead + a couple of pots (or some similar variation), putting them behind in vision early when compared to someone who goes full consumables.

You still see this recommended in most support guides and LCS casters always say things like ""he's going to be able to buy a bunch more wards with that gp10"" when realistically you won't have even broken even for the item until 28 minutes or so, if you're lucky.

So what gives? The only reason I would consider building the item these days is if the team needs engage/disengage of a Shurelya's or in some circumstances perhaps Mikael's, but lots of games won't get late enough for you to build them anyway.

A few weeks ago, me and my team participated in a low ELO tournament organised via this subreddit. We never got too far in the tournament but found out it didn't completely finish. We did however meet quite some new players through this tournament to play with and against at later times. We had fun playing the 5v5's in a tournament kind of setting and were disappointed to find out there wouldnt be more of this tournament.  


This is why we are announcing The Urf League. The Urf League is a tournament for the bronze and silver divisions.
Our first edition will be EUW only with a max. of 32 teams. We do this to make sure we can provide you with a well organised tournament.   


If this tournament gets plenty of enthusiasm and participants we will continue hosting it and hopefully expand it to the NA and EUNE regions as well.  



For now this post is meant to get your attention towards The Urf League.  We are trying to sort out special prizes and a schedule before we can open the team registrations.    



Registration will open next week if not earlier.   

A question we've got for you guys is: 
&gt; Even if we aren't able to provide you with a good prize, would you still participate?   

**What we also need:**  
* Someone who could stream some of the games, or at least the finals.  
* Any input towards the tournament will be appreciated.

Edit: Thank you guys for the enthusiasm; also seeing the request for this tournament to be held on the other servers is a really nice thing to see.  You'll be hearing more from us in the near future.   
Our next post here will be when the registration goes live along with the tournament rules; until then you can inbox us here or follow our facebook / twitter.

Don't lead a gank with your gap closer if you don't have to. 

I used to start off my ganks by hooking them towards me and doing the usual combo. While I would get kills people would get away a good amount of the time. Now I start off my banks by running up to them, using my E (aoe slow), and when they start getting away from me I pull them back.

As nidalee, to be quite honest, you really don't bring a lot to the table for support other than the immense pressure that your spear brings. Unless you're building AP, though, that spear is going to fall off really really quickly. 

Further, you need to be dead on with that spear, because you lose all lane presence when it's on cooldown. Honestly, nid is a much better choice for mid than she is for support, but i'm not going to tell you not to play something you enjoy.

So, instead of buying philo in to locket, wouldn't Kage's Lucky Pick in to Shard of True Ice be a better build?

Other aura items to consider would be will of the ancients and perhaps abyssal scepter. These items will help any other AP casters on your team, as well as keeping you relevant for a lot longer.

Oh, one more thing: traps are NOT the same thing as wards. Please actually ward.

**EDIT:** This post seems to have gained some traction, so I'd like to clarify one thing. I'm not saying nidalee is a completely non-viable support pick. I'm not trying to say the meta is God. My friend and I have had great success duoing as kayle/leona. Not at all something you see in the meta, but it works.

The best pick for any position is the character you play that position best as. My point is, and I want to make this totally clear **you need to understand what your kit brings to the table.** Nidalee offers a lot of zoning potential and a ton of pressure *if* her spear is off cooldown. However if she doesn't build AP, her spear falls off very quickly. You need to think about how to best do your job, and build appropriately.

The way he looked at it was 40% of your games you will automatically lose. This could be down to feeders, afks, raging, team collapsing into chaos whatever. 40% of your games you will automatically win due to a feeder / whatever on the opposite team. 20% give or take are the games you and your skill have a direct impact on. You win them you'll inevitably climb the ladder. 

It really made me look at the games where I'd get so frustrated at people who left or raged, but I shouldn't get frustrated. It's one of the 40%. It's out of my control. Relax, have a breather, accept it, on to the next game. 

*EDIT:* Woops! Was on my phone, forgive the typo in the title!

I should clarify: This is about how to react to a loss, not something to think during gameplay. Any player, regardless of skill, will lose a certain percentage of games. Losses are inevitable, I see this as a way to look at losses and move on from them. As /u/stormravenx put it perhaps this could reduce ladder anxiety and stop people from going on tilt.

I know there have been a LOT of posts both here and on r/leagueoflegends, but I wanted to share my most useful tips to solo queue. First off, I'm not a pro at this game, nor do I claim to be :3 This is just a compilation of tips which I found help me in my climb up the ladder. (Also? Sorry for the crappy formatting, I'm on my phone now)

1) If you do not have a decent connection that day, don't play ranked that day. This just leads you bound for failure. It's not worth attempting to play on a bad connection! (Pretty self-explanatory, but I have found myself doing this once or twice this season. Not worth)

2) If you lose a ranked game, do NOT queue up right away. At least for me, I tend to lose more and more games if I decide to queue up right after a loss. Take 5, get a drink, and then queue up again. It feels great to queue up fresh :)

3) Never, ever flame your teammates! If they did something wrong, tell them with a constructive tone. Don't say something like, ""Zed, you **** ***** l2p n00b plz report"". This is no way to treat another player. If that was you, how would you feel? Instead, tell him what he did wrong and how he could fix it! Also, you may run into someone who dies a lot in lane and ""feeds"". Still, never give up! Just focus on doing your best. It may not result in a win, but just as long as you improve as a player, it'll be worth it at the end of the day. 

4) Don't focus on countering your lane opponents, especially for lower elos. Looking at my history and past matches, this is a huge misconception. Just because you ""counter"" your opponent or vice versa does not mean your lane is automatically lost. There are many other factors involved. Play who you are strong with and fell confident in playing. (Clearly, some matchup a will be very, very unfavorable, but don't give up). 

5) Learn strong champions. While ANYTHING is viable in solo queue, I would suggest learning strong champs in each role.

6) Never give up! This goes along with what I said in point 3. Just because someone on your team gave up first blood or you are losing horribly in lane, just try your best! Try to farm to the best of your advantage in lane, don't focus on kills if your behind, and try to not feed your lane opponent. 

7) Farming. Farming is a HUGE aspect to success in League. I main ADC, and I would say one of the biggest mistakes I see in low elo ADCs is that they either farm well or harass well, but are unable to balance both. Farming is something that a lot of people at lower elos are not very good at (or don't focus on it), even though it is SUPER important. 

8) HAVE FUN! I know it can be very stressful, but at the end of the day, it's just a game. Always focus on winning and trying your best, focus on improving, and have fun :) 

Also, if you don't know about gbay99 on YouTube, I would definitely suggest checking him out. His videos are great and will further explain many points in depth made in this post. If you have any other questions, or anyone would like to add anything else, feel free to do so!
(Also, sorry about making this kind of post. I know there are a bunch of solo queue guides out there, so sorry if this sounds redundant. These are just the things that I found helpful) GL and HF on the Rift guys :)

I will be posting later today about Pressure/Decision making so look forward to that.

Hi there, I just completed my journey from Silver 4 to Platinum, invading every single match on the way there, approximately 1k games (minus the occasional game where people refused to, perhaps 1/50 games).

I experimented with several types of invade, and settled on this one because it has virtually no risk in solo que. This can be done with as few as 3 people (although you will probably only force a flash), and no level 1 cc abilities are necessary.

First, get your items as quickly as possible and run straight to mid with no delay, SPEED IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL FACTOR, THE FASTER YOU GO, THE BETTER THE INVADE. When you get to mid immediately step into the brush by their blue (assuming their jungler starts blue, if he starts Red, go to that side). You can get to this bush with 100% safety if you go quickly (unless they have a teleport teemo).
When you get there, if your team got things together quickly you can go straight into the next bush. If they didn't, but either you or another person that is with you has cc, go straight into the next brush anyways.

This bush is where you will sit and wait until one of the people on the other team comes to facecheck it. If no one comes by 1:15, leave to leash your jungle, you have plenty of time and you have lost nothing.
Here are some pointers to avoid common mistakes with this invade:
Don't change your level 1 skill for the invade, especially if you are the jungler. CC is really nice for invading, but if you walk into the middle of 4 people, you're in trouble whether they have CC or not. What's more, exhaust is standard on most supports, and if they exhaust before the enemy flashes, the flash is essentially wasted, because you can catch up to them before exhaust wears off.

Maybe you don't even get a flash for some reason, but if their Nautilus had to get anchor at L1 he's going to have a rough time clearing his jungle: this means you know he will be looking for immediate ganks on that side of the map, and that he is even MORE counterjungleable early, so going to his red might not be a bad idea...

Only flash after if it guarantees a kill. Sometimes people will walk into the first bush (the one at mid), and when they see you will flash away. This means you have won the exchange because you forced a summoner, don't change that by flashing after them.

If no one facechecks your bush, there is a decent chance they are invading you. Decide with the time left before minions spawn whether you should go back to yours and fight them (usually not the best idea, unless you wait out of sight until they start leashing blue/red and then jump them) or simply swap buffs.

Don't get greedy. Unless your team comp is infinitely better at a L1 engage (Morg, Blitz, Cho, Trist, Voli v Sona, Ez, Nid, Malp, Mord) don't try to force a 5v5 teamfight at L1. It's very easy to get a kill with this invade if you have one solid form of CC, but even a free flash is enough. Staying to try to take Blue/Red is where things can go really wrong.

Make sure everyone is on the same page. Communicate exactly what the plan is in champion select, because TeamWithPlan &gt; TeamWithoutPlan. This is what I type in select to me teams:

invade

invade

go straight to mid right away

go in

get kill/flash

leave and leash

leave by 1:15 at latest

get same L1 skill as normal

only flash after if guaranteed kill

gl gents

After that, leading by example and pinging lead to a better coordinated team.

If you have a style of invade you like, please share it! Invading is probably my favorite thing to do in League and I love doing/thinking/talking about it. Likewise, if you have any questions about this invade in particular, or invading in general, if I can't answer it someone else probably can, so ask away.

I am not a 2000k rating player, but spending time in lower elo's and slowly rising have taught me a bunch of tips that may be useful to you; so here it goes:

* Stopping limit: everybody says that after 2 losses, you should take a break. This is a great advice, but what I will say is: Take a break after 3 consecutive wins! This may sound weird, you may say ""why would I stop at a winning streak?"" Because, as your ELO gets a higher, you get matched against higher ELO players (duh), but you are dangerously close to over confidence. You may count on your teammates being good, but 50 elo (from 3 wins) does not create a huge difference. So, you are equally likely to get a feeder or troll on one of your teammates. The enemy team is higher ELO, and you, from winning 3 games, most probably underestiamte the enemy/overestiamte yourself.
Not a huge break, maybe even playing a normal game, makes a difference in coming back with a fresh mindset and not getting hung up on your previous 16/2/9 mid performance.

* Champion select: You may be a one-role player, and nothing is wrong with that when you are trying to climb. In champion select, if a player says that he/she is a GODLY mid player, trust him.. This is difficult, the trust part I know, but you will be far better off.. That player would probably play a much worse support than you would be, and you can't carry when the support feeds the enemy carry and makes bad plays.. Make your point, say your preffered role but don't be stubborn about it.

* Tri-fore: OK this is not the item. At the start of every game, I type in champion select: ""Wards, oracles, objectives"". Just to remind the team, just to make it come to their minds. They may already know this, but you didn't lose anything by typing. In the game itself, you remind this to yourself constantly. You got a ward? Perfect, don't facecheck that bush and put that ward down there. It may be a highly middle-of-nowhere brush, but playing safe is better. If you are the jungler, get oracles ASAP. Buy wards at all lanes. The most difficult part: don't chase kills if you can get objectives. Your team may be chasing mindlessly, but even if one other mate listens and you get a dragon, you are better off.
Don't forget these 3 words.

* Know two fundamental tactics and enforce it to your team: Every game is different and you can't always stick to these 2 tactics, but this is a really easy decision to make so make it. If you are ahead by far, 5-man push mid. If you are behind by far, turtle and farm/split push safely (see the previous tip). If it is even, just do your thing. If you can adapt to the actual situation, you can win more and more games.

* Capitalize on your team's mistakes, REVERSED: So, this may sound like a dick tip, but if your bottom is feeding, you should leave it. No need to waste resources as mid and jungler to get them back into game. They need TIME to get back, which you can not give by pushing for them. Defending them is another aspect; but how about you goind the opposite way and defending by being offensive? Get a 3-man kill team roaming, catch them 1 by 1. If they want to take bottom so bad, you take their solo players you take their turrets. If bottom plays defensive, they will get back in around 5 minutes. Leave them be.

* Don't tell: Disable all-chat.. Seriously, anything that can be said to the enemy, can be said after the game. Don't respond to them. Don't tease them, don't rat on your teammates. Aside from being reported, why the heck would you want a report AND a lose? In the best case, they ignore you. In the worst; they get more focused on ""making thath b***h pay"" by focusing you. Get rammus, do an actually useful taunt. (related video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-8Q4PM4PXM )

* Make advantage of feeding: Soo you end up 0/6 at first 10 minutes.. What to do? Game is lost, right? WRONG. What you are right now, is a super minion with intelligence. Go push a lane, make rest of the team push somewhere. You won't be of use anyway. If they dedicate 2 man to chase you, you waste their time as much as possible. If they go all 5 man on you, well let them enjoy their 170 and laugh as they lose a turret. Bait them into your team. Just troll the enemy team; objectives are more important than kills. (Credit goes to What the Moose for pointing this amazing tactic). Note: this one requires actually determined team members; say what you are doing and win as a team.

So, that is all for now. I will try to add more when i figure more out/remember. Hope you find these useful.

Note: I am a good mid players struggling in pre-season 3. I can comment on your replays if you send me, just PM me and I will try to help out.

Some people have mind that ""Oh support? you just stand there heal/shield carry, and that's it. Easy."" If you have this kind of mind, please do not take support. I saw so many people(even today) going for support and get weird items like doran ring or regrowth pendent that can't buy at least 3 wards. If you are the person who gets no ward for support or take weird items that can't carry enough ward, you have to think ""why my item choice is bad although it looks totally fine.""(But sometimes, Alistar takes 1 ward, 1 shoes, 1 pot. That acceptable because Alistar is an aggressive support.)

Even though people won't realize it, there are a lot of things that support do for ad carry while last hitting. Making safe farming lane, CCing enemy team, saving ad carry while teamfight, brush control, warding, healing/shielding, engaging... Please understand that support is not having fun or rest in the brush.

With bad AD carry with Good support, the lane can be okay, but with good AD with bad support can ruin the whole game. People who still think support is easy job, change your mind and think again about role of being support.

[Link to part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/p20si/a_basic_rundown_of_all_the_champions_ahri_maokai/)

* **Master Yi** - A good jungler or toplane. Has decent clear times, but needs red for a really strong gank. Can still be incredibly powerful, but doesn't have much teamfight presence unless he gets kills. Still a good pick.
* **Miss Fortune** - A bot lane carry with a lot of damage. Although powerful, she lacks natural escapes that come built in with other carries. If the team is centered around her, she is in excellent pick.
* **Mordekaiser** - MORDE ES #1 HUEHUEHUEHUE. Strong AP mid and duelist. Not mana dependent, but after some nerfs not nearly as powerful. Still very strong and good for counterpicking weaker laners.
* **Morgana** - One of the best AP mids currently. Built in sustain and good farm ability lead to her dominating a lot of lanes. An amazing ult gives her the edge in teamfights as well. Very strong pick.
* **Nasus** - A passive top laner. He requires a lot of farm to deal huge amounts of damage, but if farmed up, can be built full tank and still cripple people. Very good pick.
* **Nautilus** - A strong jungler. Pretty slow until level 3 or 4, but has unreal ganks. Not that much damage alone, but is a cc machine who can change fights for the better.
* **Nidalee** - A very powerful top laner. Although she used to be built AP, her AD variant has taken center stage. Very good sustain and strong poke lead her to be a very good pick for top. She becomes very tanky and can deal heavy blows later in game.
* **Nocturne** - Strong jungler with good clear times and powerful ganks. Turns into a tanky bruiser late game and is a very good jungle or top pick.
* **Nunu** - Good support or jungler. Can buff AD carry with attack and move speed. The buff lasts longer than the CD. Has a very strong ult and a lot of good cc.
* **Olaf** - Strong top lane and good baiter. Gets stronger the weaker he is, causing him to have a high risk/reward playstyle. Very good is played right.
* **Orianna** - A weak AP mid. Her current skill cap punishes too much for making mistakes, but if played properly can become a god in team fights, and has a nice shield and some pretty good damage. Very fun champion.
* **Pantheon** - Good top laner or jungler. Has strong poke and a long ranged jump and gap closer cc. Very strong early game, and can farm relatively well.
* **Poppy** - Very strong duelist with good cc. Weak early game and very item dependent. Gets very strong and tanky later game and has an amazing ult. Pretty weak in the current meta, and doesn't fill a specific role. well.
* **Rammus** - Very strong jungler with good clear times and amazing ganks. Has huge teamfight presence that allows AD carry to do almost true damage to someone. Excellent pick.
* **Renekton** - Great solo laner. Has strong harrass and good farm that helps him snowball effectively. His ult is very good in team fights.
* **Riven** - Very strong jungler and solo top. Has huge amounts of damage and mobility. A gap closer shield as well as two cc's make her incredibly powerful. her ult effectively turns her into the best duelist.
* **Rumble** - Amazing solo top. Not mana dependent and can farm and deal loads of damage well. Has a pretty high skill cap, but has huge damage and team fight presence.
* **Ryze** - One of the best mids currently. Although his early game is weak, he scales to mana rather than AP, which lets him get really strong and still build tanky. His late game damage is incredibly high and he can string combos together that last an incredibly long amount of time.
* **Sejuani** - Good jungler or support. Basically a cc machine that can lead into great ganks. Her ult is amazing if used properly and her team can react. Very good pick.
* **Shaco** - Insanely good jungler with amazing ganks. Has great jungle control and good clear times. Can clone himself to effectively double his damage output in fights.
* **Shen** - Good solo top. Has pretty good sustain and isn't mana based. Can tele to an ally in danger and save them, and has some nice cc for fights.
* **Shyvana** - Very strong jungler and top laner. Has amazingly fast clear times, but bad ganks. She gets a lot of damage and snowballs well.
* **Singed** - Extremely powerful top laner. Can clear minion waves and tank beatings, as well as dish out a bunch too. Nearly unkillable late game with his ultimate.
* **Sion** - Good top or mid. Can be built and used AD or AP very well. Has great cc and a lot of damage as well as tankiness.
* **Sivir** - Strong AD carry. Has lots of mobility and huge early game burst. Her ult is great for pushing and teamfights, and she can farm very effectively.
* **Skarner** - Amazing jungler with really fast clear times and great ganks. Has an amazing ult for fights, and can apply AoE cc to the entire enemy team. Very strong throughout the entire game.
* **Sona** - Very good support. Very easy to play. Revolves around auras and supporting team, not around damage and kills. Has great lane harrass but a weak heal.
* **Soraka** - Amazing support. Free mana and huge heal that also gives armor makes her excellent in lane. Global heal gives her a huge edge in team fights as well.
* **Swain** - Great solo laner. Awesome sustain and huge burst. Has great teamfight presence and scales very well. Has the potential to destroy in teamfights, but has a high skill cap.
* **Talon** - Strong solo lane assassin. Counters mages because of his silence. Synergizes well with cc machines such as Sejuani. Doesn't have that much potential in team fights, but an awesome ult.
* **Taric** - Very good support. Has a good instastun and heal in lane, and has a good skillset that helps win team fights.
* **Teemo** - Good top laner that has a strong anti-carry kit. His mushrooms are very effective as wards, and he can be built many different ways, making him very versatile. He is, unfortunately, very squishy.
* **Tristana** - Strong AD carry with a moderately high skill cap. Very good kit, but requires you to get in their faces to get full effectiveness out of it. Still very strong.
* **Trundle** - Great jungler with good ganks. Can clear pretty fast and isn't blue buff dependent. Is an effective duelist with good team fights.
* **Tryndamere**- Excellent top laner. Has awesome sustain and great harrass. Snowballs super hard into late game, but is pretty item and farm dependent. Doesn't die.
* **Twisted Fate** - Good AP mid who can farm very well. Has a nice stun, and good lane sustain but a decently high skill cap. His passive is a benefit for the entire team, and his ult helps a LOT in teamfights if used properly.
* **Twitch** - Good jungler and AD carry. Ganks are amazing, but too squishy and lacks natural escape to keep up with the other AD carries. Late game ambushes people and kills them before they can do anything, but most people get oracles by then anyway.
* **Udyr** - Amazing jungler. Can clear very fast, and has awesome ganks. Can be built tanky and still have tons of damage.
* **Urgot** - Underappreciated AD carry. Although he has no natural escape, he has a shield and some nice harass. His ult essentially punishes anyone with bad positioning and can lead to easy killings.
* **Vayne** - Very strong AD carry. Weak early game, but dominant late game. If she's shut down early, she can't snowball as effectively. VERY item dependent.
* **Veigar** - Strong AP mid with HUGE burst. Unfortunately, very squishy and insanely farm dependent. AoE stun lets him escape ganks relatively well.
* **Viktor** - AP caster mid. His shield is not very reliable as it's too slow and by the time it activates he's already taken the bulk of his damage. He does enough damage, just doesn't havethe quality of life other APs have.
* **Vladimir** - Excellent solo laner. He has good damage and awesome sustain. He can heal off exchanges very fast, but ignite kills him. Not mana dependent and still very strong.
* **Volibear** - Very fun jungler. Has pretty good clear times and awesome ganks. Super fun to play and run around as a bear killing people. Very underrated and very VERY fun.
* **Warwick** - Good jungler and top lane. He's a safe jungler rather than a fast one, and his pre-6 ganks aren't very good. He's fallen off with the addition of all the new junglers, and the easier jungle hasn't helped his case. Still a solid pick.
* **Wukong** - Great top lane. Great farm and poke that can lead to him doing well in a lane. Although he doesn't have as much to bring to the table as other top laners, still very strong and good in team fights.
* **Xerath** - Secret op mid. Very high skill cap, but VERY strong and can do a lot for the team. Skill-shot oriented which means he is generally harder to play.
* **Xin Zhao** - Strong solo laner with built in sustain. He can jungle relatively well also, and is a very strong duelist who deals out tons of damage.
* **Yorick** - Amazing solo laner. He can sit in lane all day once he gets his tear, and his sustain is his harass. Aside from his ult which duplicates the AD carry in teamfights and his lane phase, though, he can't really do much.
* **Ziggs** - Sustained AP caster. Very good range and a high burst with low cooldowns. Can effectively beat out many of the top tier AP mids.
* **Zilean** - Good support and AP mid. His bombs deal a lot of damage, and he has an effective kit for support. His ult is a free guardian angel and can lead to a teamfight victory is used right.

The new jungle doesn't give much more in terms of rewards until a fair bit later into the game. It'll probably be 15-20 minutes before you notice anything. Hunter's Machete has basically countered out the extra strength from the jungle entirely, but forced people away from boots. This has made ganking harder, and the item has also acted as an 'equalizer', pulling all clear times closer. Leashing is still important. Even if it's just doing damage. 

Summoner Spells feel more diverse. Barrier is very strong, and viable everywhere. It might become the default for carries now that heal has been nerfed on the caster. Flash and Ignite have had their cooldown increased, and Exhaust received a general nerf, making Teleport/Ghost/Heal/Cleanse/CV stronger choices overall. I haven't seen anyone brave enough to test Revive yet. It's certainly more viable, but I don't know if that means it worth taking. Despite it being clearly less effective, almost everyone is still taking Flash/Ignite because they're comfortable with it - so I haven't learned as much about this as I'd have liked.

Utility masteries are certainly very interesting, but I feel that the defensive masteries are overpowered at the moment. I currently go 0/29/1 on Nasus in PBE, and have no regrets about it. I expect a lot of supports, tops, junglers, and tanky midlaners to be going deep into the defensive tree until they nerf it. Also, SpellSword mastery is very efficient for 1 mastery point, but don't try and build around it or anything. It's just efficient, not game-changing. 

Supports feel way better with Sightstone and more passive gold. I got to buy stuff!

Onto new items:

(Ruby) Sightstone is a very nice item. Most teams should probably have 2. Support + mid/top/jungle - whoever is least item-dependant in your team-comp. It's basically the new Heart of Gold.

Crystalline Flask is a really interesting starting item. You can start with Flask + lots of wards and potions, or Flask + Fairy-Charm/Rejuv-Bead + 2 potions. Both are massively sustainable starting items. Perfect for slightly weaker early-lane champs like Nasus and Poppy. I don't know if it will become standard for toplane, or any other role such as support, but it gives a great chance to get early ward coverage &amp;/or get through a lane with high harass. It's almost gold-efficient if you sell it after just using all the charges once. Certainly a solid choice.

Almost all junglers will start Machete, Spirit Stone + Upgrades seem quite balanced for their costs. Worth the slot early game, but probably not lategame. Wriggles has been buffed a bit, and is the best jungle build for quick, cost-efficient stats. 

The default build for ADCs hasn't changed. Including Kog/Cait/ect. Insane single-target damage is simply more valuable than 'fairly high' AoE. 'Hurricane Builds' aren't totally un-viable, but you certainly want Blade of the Ruined King before you build it (scales nicely together, and Blade is better sustain + duelling, much more useful for laning phase.) You would want to go for that build if:

1. They're terrible at diving onto you (no Olaf/Irellia/ect)
2. Your team has enough CC to keep them very close.
3. Your champion has natural synergy with the build
4. You aren't needed to focus a tanky target.

4 here is especially important. Without a carry building single-target-DPS, champs like Mundo can focus on MR and your team will have a lot more trouble killing him in the lategame. You're also generally less useful for killing someone caught out of position, which is often what leads to a tower/dragon/baron/win. I think Hurricane is going to be the biggest 'trap' item in the patch. It certainly has advantages, but there are a **lot** of disadvantages.


Stattik Shiv is basically directly competing with Phantom Dancer. And losing. It's less DPS and some of it is in an AoE (not what you want. Single-target is king). 

Sword of the Divine is great for killing a single target, and only scales with AD and Crit damage. This makes in great on any assassin, and a late-game option on AD casters (it's basically a 6.0 total AD Ratio.) The cooldown is too long to get multiple activations, even with a kill, though, so I don't think it's a good option on carries. Possible item on Fiora, seems solid on Xin and Poppy. Good lategame on Talon/Renekton if you don't need tanky-ness at that point.

Mercurial Scimitar isn't very cost-efficient for an almost 4k gold item (items are usually more efficient as they get more expensive). Since Guardian Angel is weaker lategame, AD Carries are now more likely to pick up QSS, but don't expect them to upgrade it until the rest of their build is done. Also, the speed boost is so short it's barely noticeable, IMO. Especially since the first fraction of it is spent telling your character what to do after getting out of a stun. 

Zephyr is a new Nashor's Tooth. Lots of nice stats, but hard to find someone that really wants them all. Mercs + PD will be better than Zerkers + Zephyr if an ADC wants Tenacity, and ""Mercs are amazing"" remains the story for most people who would consider this. 

Black Cleaver is basically a tank item. Last Whisper is better for your own DPS, BC amplifies it for your team. Garen, tanky Riven builds. Renekton perhaps. Lee Sin.

Tiamat and its upgrade are certainly more viable. Good AD values and a 1.0 AD ratio on the item make it strong for AD casters even against single targets. The added wave-clear and teamfight AoE is a great bonus. If your team has a Diana/Orianna/Galio/Jarvan to force the enemy team together, then this is a good pickup on champions that synergize with it (e.g. Warwick ult triggers it repeatedly). 

Muramana is a really weird item. It gives AD, does magic damage, doesn't crit, and generally seems weird. I don't expect this to be used much unless a strong hybrid penetration item comes out. 

Some top laners will like Blade of the Ruined King. It gives nice in-fight sustain and an alternate damage source. Seems solid, might show up on Renekton/Irellia/Jax/Jarvan/Nid. I'm not sure if it will compete with Bloodthirster for ADCs. I don't think so, since it doesn't crit. Need to do more math.

Iceborn Gauntlet is overall solid, but it's not so much about who you build it on, as who you build it against. Against a carry with an easy escape like Ezreal, the slow field is pointless. Against someone without that blink, like Miss Fortune, it's great. Certainly a good situational item.

I haven't seen Ohmwreaker used. Catalyst was nerfed - it's not a natural build-path for anyone, and the activate is a long cooldown for a short duration, and without the base stats you'd want on an end-game item. Situational useful, perhaps. The 'make dives everywhere, waltz through stall, change game forever' item some people said it would be? Not at all. It's competing with other items like Warmogs, which could simply make you tank the tower for the extra duration, but those other items are also useful in defending, dragon/baron fights, or jungle skirmishes. Where Ohmwreaker really isn't cost/slot efficient without an enemy tower around (and maybe even with one).

Spirit Visage is really nice now. Helped by the nerf to ignite. Expect to see it more on champs with good self-sustain in a fight. Renek/Warwick/ect.

Runic Bulwark is really nice. I expect one on most teams if the game goes long enough. For raw tank stats and utility, it won't compete with Warmogs/Shurellia's, but for raw team stats, it's one of the best. 180 MR to the team overall. That's already worth the cost. 

Twin Shadows is a great item. It can find and reveal people you have no vision of. If you think they're doing dragon, you can activate it from the nearby blue buff, find out, and get a nice slow to start a fight, very safely. It's a long cooldown, but I think it's one of the stronger activate items in the game. I see this as a standard pick-up for utility-AP champs such as Maokai.

Archangels used to provide nothing but 'decent' AP in the lategame (since you'd rarely burn through your mana pool in one teamfight), but the new upgrade's shield is significant, and it's way easier to charge. I can see Rod of Ages + Archangels as a solid AP build for raw stats. Great HP, great mana, great AP, great shield. 

Banner of Command is going to be like Promote - uncommon at best.

Linadray's Torment is all about having high base damages and mediocre scaling. Preferably also a way to trigger the double damage. Like Malphite. The Pen works with base damage, and the passive also benefits from stacking pen, since it doesn't scale with AP. It scales with your opponent's HP, though, so it will be stronger late-game. That gives you plenty of chance to get a Crystal Sceptre - you can get this one anyone with solid magic base damages and 'decent' AP scaling. It just ends up being a damage calculation to compare with things like Death-cap and Void-staff. The HP is barely noticeable for an end-game item. 

Shard of True Ice is cool, but fundamentally an early-mid game item. Definitely something to sell as you move towards a final build. It depends heavily on champ synergy, too. Some supports might get this, but I feel the opportunity cost is too high for other roles.

Crucible seems very powerful, but a very high skill-cap. Expect to see people buying it, and failing to use it or failing while using it. If it's un-nerfed, it will be in every pro game half a year from now, because it's amazing. Like release Orianna, though, it's not easy to get all that power out of it.

1375610336.0,59,self.summonerschool,1joac4,Starting from Bronze V made me realize a lot of things I wouldn't know now if I were placed higher,5yphilis,80,21,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1joac4/starting_from_bronze_v_made_me_realize_a_lot_of/,"Hi everybody,
I'm currently Bronze IV and I started playing ranked games some months ago, just when i reached lvl 30.
That one was a bad move, I didn't really suck in the placement matches but having 4 wins and 6 losses I was placed in Bronze IV. I kept on playing ranked cluelessly, falling deeper and deeper into Bronze V.

When I realised I was losing 4-5 games in a row every time I tried ranked, I gave up and just played normals.
I recently found a friend who was Bronze V as well, we started playing together and in some days we're back in Bronze IV. I went three times on a winning spree and never fed in lane (but in one game...Graves-Taric doesn't forgive positioning), so I hope to rise higher and higher.

Here are my tips:

* **Never** EVER **rage**, mute toxic teammates instead (without telling them)

* Buy **wards**! Every time you back, especially if you're jungle. I find enemy wraiths a really useful place where to ward early on.

* Look at your enemies' inventory, if you're ADC and you have a BF sword while they have a vamp scepter + boots...Tell your support to **engage** as much as he can!

* If you fall behind, build **resistances** and hp, don't go glass cannon.

* In champ select, try to pick champions with **hard cc** (Leona, Blitzcrank, Fiddlesticks, Orianna, Riven, Alistar, Vayne, Draven)

* Tell your jungler to **start dragon** when he's level 7-8 (6 if Nasus, Fiddlesticks or Warwick), with the support's help. Always ward (pink) the dragon and ward normally all around to secure it.

* If they're **chasing** your support Nidalee in cat form as five, push the lanes and take a tower or a dragon! In Bronze people chase for kills all day, **focus on objectives instead**!

* If you're a jungler, **camp top** in the first minutes if your botlane has a strong early (Miss Fortune, Caitlyn). It will piss off the enemy to planer and their jungler will have all the reasons to stay top as well, giving your botlane an advantage.

* If you're toplane, buy a pink and **deny vision** to the enemy top. Your jungler will love to gank a non-warded lane.

* **Time your buffs** and pick them up as soon as they spawn. If you're not the jungler, tell your jungler that the buff is up and that he should pick it.

* **Play with a friend!** Pick two champions with clear synergies and go botlane, usually the enemy team won't have a real support (Nidalee, Lux) that will start with Doran's and no wards...Profit!

* If you're **falling behind**, let the tower fall and free farm safely. Usually you want to take another tower in exchange.

* ""Hey I'm Gold smurfing let me *put role here*""...Most of the time is bullshit.

* Ban Master Yi. People can't handle him and he will surely get fed early. I know this one is controversial, but... Do you trust in your soloQ Bronze teammates? I don't. Yi requires such low mechanics that he gets fed in no time if you can't deal with him (early armor, denying farm, calling when he's missing).

* If a person calls for support in champ select when you're duoing, let him support after checking if he actually builds properly. You can go jungle or mid and roam instead.


Some more questions:

* How to deal with people losing their lane hard (I had a Ryze 0-8 after six minutes yesterday)? I saw that trying to tell things like ""play safe"" or ""buy wards"" doesn't work.

* How to deal with things like...""Omg how do you dare to tell me to buy wards when you're support?""..jungler, ends 1-13 and begs for surrender after 10 minutes.

* How to convince your jungler to force a dragon? Also, how to tell your teammates to prefer objectives over chasing? 

* How to keep your team's morale high even if you're behind? I almost spam ""gj"", ""wp"" when I see people doing good and ""come on"", ""don't give up!"", when I see people dying, but it doesn't work that good.

* I feel comfortable playing support, and I'm almost all the time ""forced"" into playing Thresh/Leona instead of Sona/Zyra/Fiddlesticks since my team doesn't go tanky (Wukong top full damage and Warwick jungle full attack speed, I was Fiddlesticks and I had to initiate team fights for my team. I build a Sunfire Cape+Locket...) and NEVER EVER initiate teamfights. I mean, you're Wukong, you're tanky, run into them, jump on the adc and press R... Seems like they can't do it so I'm ""ruining"" my KDA initiating the team fights and dying while my team doesn't follow...
What to do? I ping them that I'm running in, but even if we're 5v4 because their adc is farming bot they just stall...

Here are some tips that may not be immediately obvious.

* Avoid taking your first skill right away if you're jungling, wait to take e at wraiths. If there is a jungle invade your q can help you escape or secure a kill. E is best for clearing jungle at level one because cripple reduces the damage you take.
* You can q wolves over the far wall closer to the fountain. It's faster to walk to the wall and q over from base than to walk through the jungle.
* It is usually wise to delay following up your q until you have done more damage. Resonating strike does execute damage and can negate your enemy's escapes.
* When ganking or killing your lane opponent lead by safegarding to a minon close to the enemy if at all possible. This leaves your q to chase farther and allows you to pull of the Q + R + Q combo.
* If you don't fear a buff steal use Q + Smite + Q to get extra execute damage on the camp.
* Remember that iron will (2nd w) gives a good chunk of health from smiting.
* While running always check for nearby jungle camps. A Q through the wall is a great escape.
* Ward jumps are faster if you smartcast items. I always put my wards in the 5th slot, which is bound to my x key. You do have to get used to ward placement range for this to work.
* With cripple and a ward jump you can usually get behind a champ for a kick and save your flash for when you need it.
* When damaging towers be sure to maximize your passive. Time 2 AAs for every ability that you can use. If the enemy is coming save your w to escape.
* Don't chase singed
* Again, maximizing your passive is very important. If you cannot burst an enemy try to space your abilities with 1 or 2 AAs. You can avoid running out of energy and will do more damage over time with increased attack speed.
* If you are next to a wave when leaving the base W farther up to get to lane faster.
* Lee Sin has two good reveals with E and Q. Fight with Teemo, Akali, and Twitch.
* If you know that you're going to get caught in lane try to Q the back line of enemy minions before the enemy players get in range. Run the opposite direction or into a bush to draw them away from your marked minion then Q at the last second. With ward jumps, a flash, and a Q into a jungle camp you can pull off amazing escapes.
* Make sure you don't Q + W poke when you could be hard CC'd. It's a good idea to go over who can catch you when you load into the game
* If you're stuck in a 2v1 in the jungle, such as you versus bot lane, Q the support, kick them over the wall, and follow with resonating strike. Coolest way to get out of sticky situations, even if it only works 10% of the time.
* You can gank mid by throwing you Q from the enemy wraith camp into the enemy mid and then follow up by kicking them out of their tower. You can also use this on minions after counter jungling.
* If your queuing with a mid tell them to stand on one side of mid lane while you stand in the opposite bush. The other laner will naturally move closer to you. Also ask about ward placement, often times only one side of mid is warded.
* Always consider counter ganking even when your laner has died. With a safeguard and a flash you can easily catch low-health enemies who don't immediately back off.
* If you are forced back in lane, use Q to last hit a maximum range. Practice using the edge of E to last hit, it does as much damage as an AA but from a safer distance.

It is not the jungler's job to just farm and watch their lanes either win/lose. You have arguably the biggest impact of the game. If there's a Morde mid, **PUNISH** him he pushes too far without wards.

Also, look at the items built in every lane. This will give you a sense of strength/weakness of the lane and whether or not you can pull off a successful gank.

INA Aurelius here again with another guide for my ""Tips for Success"" mini guide series! And this time, froma special request from  **PermanentDmg**, I'll be writing about the importance of positioning as the ADC. I hope you guides enjoy this guide as much as I enjoy writing them! As always, feel free to comment below on anything you think I missed or got wrong! Thanks ahead!

[](/ashe)  [](/caitlyn) [](/corki) [](/draven) [](/ezreal) [](/graves) [](/missfortune) [](/sivir) [](/tristana) [](/twitch) [](/urgot) [](/varus) [](/vayne)

**Original PM from PermanentDmg**

&gt; Yeah, I feel like many people at my level (bronze league) play ADC and focus the other team's carries without regards for their own safety. If you wouldn't mind, would you write a post about ADC positioning? I'm sure there's a lot about that where I could improve.

**Reply** - This is very true, for I see it all the time even in the higher ELOs, in which, it all comes down to **evaluating the situation, correctly, and then acting appropriately on it** e.g. Don't engage as Vayne to kill an Ezreal w/ only 100 HP left when his full team is there with him and you have no back-up from your team, which may be on it's way or in another lane too far away to help. 

**Key Concepts of Positioning as the ADC**

When it comes to the very complex mechanic of positioning, i.e. specifically your decision making in engagements, you must remember these key concepts:

 * Be excessively **aware** of all of your surroundings, i.e. what is going on (map awareness). This is so that you do not get caught trying to 1v1 an enemy who is caught out of position, e.g. you spot an enemy Lulu warding river and you engage for a kill w/o looking to realize that the rest of the enemy team is not visible on the map, so that you die since the enemy team was in a nearby bush. 

 * **Think** beforehand of everything you do, especially during **and** before teamfights. Evaluate the enemy team, item-wise and kit-wise, and determine who is going to attempt to kill you first, e.g. you see an enemy Katarina with a DFG, your assumption here is that she'll be focusing you down first, so you plan your actions ahead of time, e.g. you wait for Katarina to put herself in a bad position since you'll be **positioning** yourself out of range for Katarina's kit and DFG range, **all** while fighting in the teamfight.

 * Learn how to **kite** the **entire** enemy team, cause knowing how to kite 1v1 is, I won't say very easy, but it's not that hard if you know your champion well enough, i.e. ranges, and know your enemy well enough. I know it's probably the most difficult thing in League of Legends, but once mastered, it is a devastating mechanic to know! Everybody remembers the MLG in Dallas, TX with MRN vs CLG, right? The Vayne, Doublelift, was focused by the entire enemy team, i.e. Alistar Pulverize, Diana Q + R nuke, Irelia stun, etc., well he, Doublelift, in spite of that, knew the mechanic of kiting very well and was able to use Vayne's Tumble to kite the entire enemy, e.g. Tumble backwards away from the team, moving left and right, etc., while landing AAs, abilities, and etc., while in the end, it gave him a Triple Kill while having less than 200 HP. **Now** just imagine if you, as the ADC, could pull that off? Fact is, you can, with just enough practice with you preferred ADC. **Practice is key here, don't ever stop practicing your kiting skills.**

 * Know your DMG potential as whoever/whatever ADC you're playing, i.e. with items and without items. 

 * Position yourself in a way in which it would make the enemy team extremely difficult to get to you, **while** keeping in hcek that that position gives you an advantage to take out your target, e.g. you have a Leona to peel for you, so ideally you'd want to stay somewhere remotely behind or near her, while being close enough to focus enemy targets.

 * Understand when it is appropriate to ""jump"" into the fray of the 5v5 teamfight to secure a kill that is either escaping on low HP or is about to kill one of our teammates and you're able to burst him/her down. This can be the difference between, not only, life or death, but the overall outcome of the teamfight, i.e. your team wins or loses, for it may not be worth Arcane Shifting in as Ezreal just to kill the Irelia running away with 50 HP when the rest of her team is still &gt;50% HP or not fleeing with her for they may notice you and kill you instantly, meaning for your team, that their #1 DMG source is now dead and they have to retreat. Having good decision making is key guys, don't start a game without it. 

**Note** - Sorry guys, for the late post, I know I said I'd make a post everyday and I shall, was just busy with the SNSS, which btw, I encourage all of you to participate in, for you learn A LOT! 

Even though this guide is not finished, I shall be updating as the day goes and as well as tomorrow, so keep updated on this! As always, feel free to comment below on anything I've gotten wrong and/or have missed. Thanks again! happy League-ing guys! Oh! And Happy Easter as well!

The reason I'm posting is to gauge what the community thinks of this kind of project and whether or not you would find it at all useful.

To those of you who are actively trying to improve, what measures are you going through to achieve your goals? Are there any resources you as a player have looked for but couldn't find?
I am really looking for ANY possible feedback. If you think this is a huge waste of time, I would appreciate the honesty.

I've been doing this for about a month now (vods can be found at www.youtube.com/summonerslift or in list form at www.summonerslift.com). If you have a replay you want me to check out, go ahead and email it to summonerslift@gmail.com

Here are a couple examples of the formats I've tried:

1. Basic replay analysis - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIfGmnYKmUg
2. Replay analysis w/ skype chat of person being reviewed (he comes on around 25~m http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI8T3OnzuRo&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1389s
3. Simple first-person game w/ commentary - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVzOm_1HFEE

Thanks for taking a look. All the best.

I might end up picking a new student from the people here, because I think more people deserve this chance.

So 4 months ago I met a girl who was playing league at 1000 ELO. She seemed sad about it, so I decided to mentor her and teach her the whole game. We have been through tough games, we lost, we won. She had self-confidence only to have it crushed by haters moments later. We restored it. Now she is about to do try-outs to join a pro female team. I'm sooo proud of her, yet I had to say something wrong, resulting in crushing her self-confidence again. I hope she makes the try-outs I know she can do it.

So Ask me Anything about what I did and how to get better. I main AD and Support at 2.3k.

It's not that he really sucks because he's ok at the game and I am about the same skill level as him so I wouldn't really be able to come out and say, ""Hey, you're kind of sucking."" without sounding like a douche and have an, ""I'm better than you"" attitude. And also, I'm not necessarily saying he sucks but the fact that he's one of the players that talks shit every game, will criticize people on their builds if they're not exactly how he would build them, (and not in the nice way, it would be like, ""Why are you putting a Zhonya's on that you retard, you're supposed to put a Liandry's.""), he always goes into a game with the attitude that, ""I'm better than everyone in this lobby"" but is a bronze V in ranked. And then the thing he said the other day when we were playing is, ""I could be in Silver I, I just don't like to play adc."" It made me want to rip his head off. The list goes on and on of things he does but I don't want to rant more than I already have. (Sorry for the long rant by the way, I've just been holding this in for far too long.)

So, what I'm asking you guys and gals is, how do I tell him nicely that I don't like playing with him because of his attitude during game and that he's kind of sucking it up with out seeming like a total douche? I also should mention that I am in bronze V and I am around the same skill level.

TL;DR: Have a friend who's cocky and a dick in League and need to tell him nicely to STFU.

**Note:** I have a friend of mine, Shr00mie, you may have seen him on here before, helping me with this guide, so as a thank you for the support, I'm giving him a shoutout! Keep it up, man! You're doing well! 

**Notes of Consideration/Explanation**

 * These champions get picked if left opened by any majority of players, both smurfs and regulars alike, and are both played in the manner of knowing how to play them excessively well, or being of the complete opposite, by knowing absolutely nothing of the champion, mainly in lower ELOs, as they just end up not performing well at all, i.e. Shen who builds AP and doesn't utilize his Ult or kit to it's maximum effect.

 * *Feeder's Mentality:* According to some PMs and vouches by various IRL friends, there is, supposedly, a certain mentality within lower ELO players to purposely feed the enemy, which happens to be playing one of the Big Four, so that he may ""show"" the rest of his team why one should always ban that certain champion. (Now I'm not purely sure on if this is 100% true, for when I play Draft or Ranked, my bans are purely based upon what my team and I can't handle, e.g. Top Lane says he can't play against and Singed, banned. If not that then, my bans are usually against Champions that take advantage of people who do not have good Map Awareness, i.e. Twisted Fate, Kassadin, Kha'Zix, etc.)

**The Why &amp; How**

##Shen [](/shen)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * Shen's ultimate, United We Stand, allows him to apply global pressure to every fight without ever truly being present. 

 * He is considered strong due to the fact that he is innately tanky and that he out-tanks all other tanks before him, with and without items. 

 * His in-lane harass is primarily Magic DMG, something many lower ELO players do not take into account as they go Top Lane against him, in which they may choose to go with a rune page without MR Glyphs, and since Shen is one of the few champions who can absolutely stay in lane and play safely with just a Doran's Shield start, and since he's Energy based, the harass will continue on for ages.

 * He is nearly impervious to 1v2 tower dives for, if he plays his cards correctly, he can easily duel 2 champions under his tower and come out on top, thanks to his W Shield, and E Taunt AA/Ability cancellation. 

 * He is a very strong splitpusher thanks to both his kit, i.e. Ultimate and E Dash, but his splitpushing power is only truly strong/reliable for the enemy team when his ultimate is up AND he has either Statik Shivv or Sunfire Cape, which allows him to clear much quicker.

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Punish him for split pushing if you can, e.g. if he is splitpushing without Statik Shivv or Sunfire Cape, which is his major form of clearing waves quickly enough so that the enemy team can't respond, if doesn't have those times, his clear speed is abysmal, so take advantage of that by heading up to stop him, if not at least push him away. 

 * Bait him into his Ultimate when you are ready for it. Any form of hard CC can stop him from teleporting. 

 * If you're top against a Shen and he happens to use his Ultimate to save someone, AND you know you won't be able to repond in time to help, then your responsibility is to punish him by shoving his lane down hard. 

 * Know your DMG potential with your respective champion, for that is key to knowing if you can out harass/trade with him. 

 * Baiting his W will allow you ""free DMG"" in which he can't shield, this can simply be done by walking up towards him when he tries to last hit. 

 * Attempt to force him to farm using only Qs, if you can't at least out trade with him. You'll eventually out farm him. 

 * Do not play champions against him that have no innate ranged ability, for, if the Shen knows what his is doing, will just kite you down, e.g. champions like Riven, Xin Zhao, etc. 

##Malphite [](/malphite)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * He scales off of pure defensive stats, making him innately tanky, thanks to items, and his Passive shield. 

 * He has a very strong initiating spell that applies hard CC in which takes advantage of lower ELO players:

  * Reaction speed, meaning one is not quick enough to Flash/Dash/Escape out of it if the opportunity is available. 

  * Map Awareness, for Malphite can completely take the enemy team by surprise through FoW with one ult. 

  * ADCs positioning, for lower ELO ADC players have yet to acquire the key concept of positioning with ADCs, meaning kiting back and back and back, (think Doubelift Vayne style)

 * Has a very strong transition throughout all phases thanks to his innate tankiness and Magic DMG harass.

 * His E plus the active from Randuin's Omen will make your AD AA based champions practically useless during teamfights, for ADCs, again, takes advantage of poor positioning, if the ADC happens to be within Randuin's Active range. 

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Building early MR against him will help mitigate his DMG potential

 * Constantly applying AA pressure if you're ranged or if you're able to out trade him, may prevent him from refreshing his shield. 

 * Applying enough pressure to Malphite early on to as-cert lane dominance will force him to farm with Qs from afar, which limits him greatly from the gold he needs to spend on his core items to be tanky.

 * Malphite is countered by champions that deal % DMG to him, i.e. Zac, Elise, etc., or champions that are able to out burst/DPS his Shield during early game, e.g. Kayle, Jax, Renekton, etc.

 * If you're playing as the ADC on your team, always remember to reposition yourself away from Malphite, preferably in the back, also, asking your Support or Jungler to peel for you would be the most ideal solution. 

##Amumu [](/amumu)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * People at lower ELOs don't Counter Jungle as much as I'd like them to, no matter how much I coach them to. When left alone in the jungle Amumu is able to clear camps fairly quickly, meaning his ganking potential increases the sooner he clears those camps.

 * He is easy to pick up and play, if one is able to land skill shots and has good timing on pressing R. Hard to master though, as with every champion.

 * Lower ELO players have yet acquired the skills to dodge skill shots, i.e. Amumu's Bandage Toss, even though it is deemed as a very slow skillshot.

 * He is a considerably strong DPS champion that is innately tanky that is able to deal AoE DMG. 

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Counter Jungling him will shut him down, e.g. invading Lvl 1 by yourself, it is very very hard for Amumu to catch back up if he dies early on, use that to your advantage. 

 * Warding  +  good map awareness prevents his long range ganks. 

 * Remember that Amumu generally has no follow up after his Q + R combo, so if you know either of those are down and you happen to catch him out of position, you can kill him. 

 * Forcing him to waste his Ultimate to escape may be ideal.

 * He's very squishy during the early stages of the game, at times he won't even realize how squishy he is and Q into his doom. 

 * Get your team to work together, but not necessarily group up in a bunch.

 * Remember that his Ult doesn't stop channeled spells, use that to your advantage. 

##Blitzcrank [](/blitzcrank)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * As a CC machine, he can cripple an enemy team before they have enough time to respond. 

 * His Q has a pretty short cooldown and its hit-box is very very silly.  

 * His high utility makes him strong during the whole game with little items. 

 * He is able to bait well, thanks to his Passive + Flash + Q + E.

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Stay behind your minions!

 * Even with his Passive, he is generally pretty squishy, he is a support after all, so use that to your advantage, if you know you have enough DMG potential to kill him regardless of his shield, for I've seen many Blitzcrank players who were too complacent thanks to his/her Passive shield. 

 * Ward so he doesn't have bush control. 

 * Pick an aggressive zoning support against him, e.g. Leona, Thresh, Zyra, etc., Passive supports, e.g. Sona, Soraka, don't fair well against him. 

 * It is generally a good idea to engage versus him while his hook is on CD. 

 * Keep moving, this goes for any skillshots, If you're standing still he is most likely to land his grab.

[Link to original post!](http://learning-league.blogspot.com/2013/04/solo-queue-mindsets.html)


**Introduction**


If you have been exposed to any sort of League community, you have most likely heard people complain about being stuck in elo hell and how they should be platinum/diamond/challenger tier and their teams are always so bad. Recently, Sky released a video about being those that complain about elo hell, which I think touches on some of the more obvious reasons why people are stuck at their level. Today, I wanted to look at some mindsets you can get into in order to improve with some of my own personal experience.


**Mindsets**


***1) You are the worst player on your team.***


This is a mindset I held for a very long time, starting when I first started playing DotA on WC3 and carrying over into League for quite a while as well. What this means is that regardless of skill level, you are the worst player on your team and you need to play your damn hardest to show your team that you are not a liability. The feeling is similiar to getting a popular streamer or professional player in your game and you have to prove yourself as a capable League player to them. The beauty of this mindset is that you will always be playing at your absolute best, you won't be getting lazy because you feel like you must carry your team or that your team has a better comp.


***2) Every game should be played like a promotion series game***


Back in my Super Smash Brothers Melee days, I attended a local tournament and was playing friendlies against this extremely technical Fox. I knew that I was a better player than him, but for some reason my Jigglypuff was getting stomped left and right while his friends watched on. The tournament finally began and my confidence disappeared as I found my first match was against the Fox. So what was the outcome?


I stomped the hell out of him, 2-0 with both matches being a 3-4 stock. The guy was furious after, accusing me of going easy on him in friendlies and letting him win. That certainly wasn't the case and it took me a while to figure out why the sudden turn of events. In friendlies, I had an underlying thought that I was not gaining anything by playing against this person as there was nothing on the line. I wasn't gaining any sort of skill since I was a better player than him and I wasn't going any further in a bracket because it was just a friendly. Then once the tournament started, my mindset had shifted without me realizing it. I had a lot to lose (being sent to loser bracket, reputation for losing to someone worse than me) and a bracket advancement to gain.


So what does this mean in League? I don't know about the general populace, but I know that my mindset is very poor in solo queue. I've become so accustomed to being a gold player that I don't feel like I have any pressure to push myself higher. If I am not playing during my promotion series or when I have 0 LP, there's a severe lack of motivation since there is no immediate reward or punishment, just a number that goes up and down. So with regards to myself, I need to find some outside motivation to make myself work harder in those games in between promotion series. Desire to reach challenger tier, wanting to be higher rated than a rival, etc.


***3) Place blame in yourself instead of others***


Everyone has been in a game where you are performing well while the rest of your team performs poorly. It could be in the form of being outplayed or someone trolling, but it comes down to things that are out of your control. In this situation, it's very easy to believe that you would've won if your team was good and go on to verbally abuse your team, blaming people, that sort of stuff. This is probably the biggest reason why people never improve; they see their teammates as inhibiting their rise to the top rather than their own skill.


If you want to get a higher elo, you need to rely on yourself to get up there. You can't just win your lane and expect your team to be competent, you need to completely outplay the other team and demonstrate you deserve much more. The best way to improve is watch replays of yourself via LOLreplay and perfect your play. If someone on your team dies, look at ways that you might have been able to change that. Search for common things your opponents do and find a way to exploit them. When I was first doing ranked, I found that mid lanes almost always follow their opponent if they disappear into the river. So I took advantage of that and baited them into nearby bushes and destroyed them.


I feel like jungling is a great way to gain elo. The whole map is your playground and if you learn how to counter jungle at your elo, you remove their presence from other lanes. Learn jungling paths, look at situations in which you can counter gank, etc etc. If you are just farming and ganking normally, I guarantee there is more you could be doing to impact the game.


***4) Play like you are tutoring / someone is shoutcasting you***


This is something every player can start doing immediately. When you play, talk about everything you are doing, even if  it's just to yourself. While in champion select, look at the team compositions and talk about why you are choosing X champion and how it helps your team or does well against the other team. In game, talk about what item paths you will be going for and why, commentate on your play and the thought process behind it, and your role in team fights. Or if you don't want to talk about yourself in first person, imagine that someone is shoutcasting your match and they are following only you.


The idea behind this is that it makes you play smarter. If you are speaking aloud, it keeps you from doing stupid things such as overextending with no wards or diving someone on a tower. When about to make a play, think about someone like Phreak commentating about what's going to happen. Is he going to be super hype about your play or is he going to be scratching your head and wondering why you did that? Speaking aloud can also help break tunnel vision and focus on the game as a whole rather than just one goal.


**Conclusions**


If you are playing perfectly, then you should be winning way more games. Taking something new from a game is way more important than just winning/losing and not learning anything. Watch streams and look at things pro players might do and try to apply them to your own playstyle. Play a single champion constantly rather than whomever might be OP at the moment and learn all their strengths and weaknesses. Once you play them enough, you can focus on your own general playstyle rather than how to play a champion well.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,default,True,t3_1bhoyr,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1bhoyr/solo_queue_mindsets_becoming_a_better_player/,
1364494635.0,58,self.summonerschool,1b6vzz,PSA on counter picking and playing insta-banned champs,charmed_quark,69,11,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1b6vzz/psa_on_counter_picking_and_playing_instabanned/,"1. Just because Blitz/Shen/Amumu don't get banned, it doesn't mean that you are any good at playing them.  I've played too many games where people are like 'OMG get me Blitz GG OP' and we proceed to get stomped because you couldn't hit the broad side of a Baron with your skillshot.

2. Counter picks don't mean anything unless you are at the same skill level as the other person - and really, only if you are at Plat level or above.  Again, so many games I see 'OMG Y counters X so hard, GG we win' only to again be decimated because Summoner 3 knows how to play Champ X and you have played Champ Y six times.

This is one of the most frustrating things I seem to deal with constantly, in both ranked (Bronze I) and normal draft pick games.  Please play champs you are good at instead of trying to imitate LCS players, who could beat your Katarina mid playing Trundle and buying 6 pairs of boots.

I am LoL_Teacher and I made this account primarily for answering questions/ helping others on any of the League of legends sub reddits. I feel I have been unsuccessful, even though I have had a couple of people come back to me to explain things (and how to think about builds/ items etc for themselves), due to lack of my explanation (laziness) or due to the lack of me answering a reasonable number of questions.

However I plan to go a step further (than just fix my laziness) and put some quality posts (I hope). My plan is to go into reasonable depth in each topic I write. I would first like to ask if anyone is interested in posts like this?

My current plan (topics which would each take a separate post):

* **Sleeper Champions/Builds** - Builds not Utilized, Positions not Utilized

* **Supports** - Builds, Items not Utilized, Warding, How to Play with an AD Carry, Aggression in lane and How to Receive Ganks

* **How to Figure out any Champion** - General mechanics and Item Builds

* **Theorycrafting 101** - Basic item Building and Basic Team Composition Building

* **Winning a Lane** - Comparing Mechanics, Counter Building, Finding Strengths and Weaknesses and Nuances of Lanes

* **How to win a game** - Basics on Teamwork, Individual Skills, Objectives, Counter Strategies, How to respond to a fed enemy, How to keep yourself or your teammates fed

If there no love for a particular subject or if there is something not on the list that you want feel free to post! If you feel this would be better suited in Summoner School or the general League of legends sub Reddit just say. Also for any reason someone would like to collaborate with me (i have no idea why xD) on a particular subject just ask and I will most likely say yes.

I will start writing these after tomorrow and see the response to determine whether or not I should continue from the feedback. (or wont even start if the general response to this is horrific).

TL:dr Going to make some long, in depth posts on certain topics. Yay or Nay?

Here's a jungle guide :)",Hypercolour,78,17,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/13va1v/hey_look_wws_free_heres_a_jungle_guide/,"Lemme start off by saying that Warwick is one of the most versatile champions in terms of items, skill orders and pre-game setups. There's so many ways to build and play the guy that it would be ridiculous to say that one definitive way is the best. However, this is my take on the most efficient way to play him from the jungle. Now, on with the guide!!!

Warwick, the ~~Blood Hunter~~ **BAD-ASS BITCH SLAPPIN' WEREWOLF!**



He's a slow clearing jungler but he's fun and does good damage and never dies and solo's baron so early and if you have Hyena skin he laughs at you as he eats your flesh and grinds your bones into dust and snorts them off your dead body. Legit.

**RUNES**: AS reds for a faster clear, goodness knows he needs it. He also rocks with AS. WHY NOT AD well because his sustain isn't via lifesteal its through on-hit so AS is best. Armour yellows durrrr. MR/lvl blues if you like being tanky or AS blues if you want a million AS at level one but like dying to APs. Movement speed quints, don't fuck around man. This'll actually let you gank a bit pre-6 with your 405 movespeed, and helps you get in range for your ultimate. 

**MASTERIES**: I like 21-9-0 because it lets you kill more shit which is what wolf is about. Grab penetration in offence, dual penetration ;) and then straight up the right hand side for more attack speed and damage and shit. Then take the smite mastery because who doesn't like extra gold for bitch slapping minions, 3 in armour, 4 in that other thing on the left hand side and Veteran's Scars. [This](http://imgur.com/ryrMo) is an actual picture of the mastery page I run.

**STARTING ITEMS**: I usually like to open with WHATEVER I FUCKING WANT because you're a wolf with a billion sustain but no seriously **boots and three fucking pots** would be a good start. Up to you whether you go HP or mana but I usually like 2 HP and 1 mana. This lets you get health back and shit but you can also get mana back and shit which is boss.

**SUMMONERS**: SMITE AND FLASH. Don't be a dumb fuck and be like 'y0 mang TRM is da best and WW can jungel without smite so i wont take it' NO TRM SUCKS AND YOU NEED SMITE! Also, I opt for flash as my second summoner as it allows you to flash-ult, which makes for a mean gank. However, you can run ghost, exhaust or even ignite if you want.

**SKILL ORDER**: Once again w/e you want even start E if you want to YOLO. My preferred skill order, however, is **WQQEQR**, followed by skilling **R&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E**. I do this because I always take extended route with WW so wolves first is good, and the AS helps you kill these more than Q does. 

**ROUTE**: I DO WOLVES BLUE WRAITHS GOLEMS RED WRAITHS AND THEN FARM UNTIL 6 OR MADRED'S RAZORS WHATEVER.

**ITEM BUILD**: I deliberately left this late because no matter what, people gonna have differing opinions on this. However, these are my thoughts on building the best bitch slappin Wick you'll ever see.

**Wriggle's Lantern** is fucking bitchin on wolfman because it gives him amazing sustain and epic control of buffs and dragon. Also a free ward HEY THATS AWESOME and some AD because dat ult has 20% scaling. I will usually make Wriggle's my first item because he can solo dragon so early lol. Late game you can sell that shit for like a BT or something but sometimes I keep it because its good for Baron control.

Early game you can choose from a lot of boots BUT IF YOU BUY ZERK'S I WILL LITERALLY KILL YOU, either get Tabi if you're jewish and want armour, Sorc's if you want DAMAGE, Mobi if you really wanna get in range of dat ulti (good if you gank all the time), or Merc's if you I dunno need CC reduction and MR. I typically go either Sorc's or Merc's as these are the ones you will want for late-game for damage and tankiness respectively. 

My core late game WW build consists of boots (either **Sorc's** or **Mercury Treads**), **Wriggle's, Frozen Heart, Wit's End and Spirit Visage**. Therefore, I will want to be working towards this build the whole time. I will always get one **Kindlegem** during the early stages of the game as it gets you a bit tankier and also gives you **CDR WHICH YOU FUCKING LOVE** seriously CDR is sooooo good on Wick which is why I try to max it out every game. Also Kindlegem builds into SV and Zeke's, both of which are awesome on wolfman. **Glacial Shroud** is an excellent mid-game item as it gives you a lot of what you need, and you'll keep it until end game. **Wit's End** is another item you'll be keeping until the end of the game and you scale well with it, AS and MR and MORE MR and ON HIT SWEET MARY THANK YOU! Another item that ain't half bad is **Haunting Guise**, and its well worth considering if you're fed and need some more damage. **Hexdrinker** ain't bad either you will be deceptively tanky and your ult gains damage too. Finally I love getting **Guardian Angel** on WW as it gives him resists and shit and then you get back up and kill more shit. Oh and about **Spirit Visage** its dope as shit but I usually sell it late game for some other shit. Oh Aegis is good as well.

I ceebs explaining the billion other item choices, but I'm going to leave you with some example six item builds depending on the situation.

**GENERICWICK**: Mercury Treads, Frozen Heart, Wriggle's Lantern, Wit's End, Maw of Malmortius, Guardian Angel.

**THEY HAVE TONS OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE WICK**: Mercury Treads, Frozen Heart, Wriggle's Lantern, Randuin's Omen, Sunfire Cape, Guardian Angel.

**THEY HAVE TONS OF MAGIC DAMAGE WICK**: Mercury Treads, Frozen Heart, Wit's End, Spirit Visage, Maw of Malmortius, Guardian Angel.

**SUPPORT AURA WICK**: Mercury Treads, Frozen Heart, Aegis of the Legion, Zeke's Herald, Shurelya's Reverie (ohhhh full CDR bitch), MR item of your choice (QSS, Maw, Wit's, SV, Banshee's, FoN, GA).

**I DON'T LIKE DYING WICK**: Mercury Treads, Frozen Heart, Sunfire Cape, Randuin's Omen, Force of Nature, Guardian Angel.

**TONS OF DAMAGE WICK**: Sorcerer's Shoes, Bloodthirster, Wit's End, Maw of Malmortius, Frozen Heart, Guardian Angel.

**WTFWICK**: Sorcerer's Shoes, Bloodthirster, Void Staff, Abyssal Sceptre, Frozen Heart, Guinsoo's Rageblade. Honestly, try this sometime. You might end up dying in a couple of seconds, but you'll do hella damage, and WQR gets you up to full Rageblade stacks IIRC.

**HOW DO I PLAY WICK** well its simple. Wick is super easy to play here's what you do. Jump on shit and press everything. Early game, once you hit six, you should look to gank a lane immediately as it should end up in a kill. Ult, turn on E, hit W as you come out of ult, Q and chase. If you can, walk into Q range, hit Q, ult and by the time you come out of it Q should be up soon after. You can also gank pre-6 if you have red buff. 

Remember you have **BEAST DRAGON CONTROL** and you can solo it as soon as you get Madred's, should be about level six. If you can do it safely go in and slap that bitch. You have awesome buff control as well so don't be afraid to counter jungle a little bit. Keep ganking when opportunities arise because you're good at it evertim your ult is up.

TEAMFIGHTS WOO ult the highest threat simple as that I usually like ulting people who can do shitloads of damage like the AD and AP carries. Spam W because it helps your team members like a boss, keep E on for more MS, Q shit. Ward everywhere or force your support to. Remember people are gonna try CC you in teamfights because WW is a sexy dawg and everyone wants the WW dick, so be prepared for that but that's okay because it means they're not CCing your AD carry. Every elixir is awesome on Wick so get them all, especially blue pot because it gives you CDR.

That's it! Hope the guide helped, add me in game or PM me if you wanna know anything more or even comment here if you want &lt;3

- If you are new it is a good idea to do the tutorial mission. Not only does it cover quite a few of the basics, but you get nearly 500 IP from a 10-15 minute game, which is enough to unlock another champion permanently. From here, picking one of the free champs you like the look of is a good way to start. Load up a custom game with one bot on the enemy team and try out the champ, testing out all the skills and getting the hang of them. Then try them out in a coop vs. AI game and see how you do!  
  
- The general consensus about runes is to not worry about them until you hit level 20. The tier 3 (and best) runes are unlocked when you hit 20, so anything you got before then just becomes obsolete. Spend your early IP on a couple of cheap champions, don't buy anyone expensive until they become free and you play them. 
With masteries, its a good idea to put the first couple you get into the Summoner Spell masteries, because these are pretty good and help you out a little bit. I would say sinking the rest into the flat MR/Armor masteries until you get past level 7. [This ](http://i.imgur.com/YT7vq.png) is a great little flow chart for which runes to buy for which purpose.

Whenever somebody teaches somebody else, say for a few games together or some intensive theorycrafting, the student messages the moderator team, and we assign the teacher a badge.

Other than the teacher system, there are a few other badges. For example: the caster badge is for people who shoutcast in-house games or for the SNS, the book badge is for people who have written a 'Guide of the Week', and a slew of individual badges have been made for special individuals.

There is a huge stress on counterpicking, and there should be - it is very important to pick favorably against your lane opponent. However, should you find yourself against an assassin as a squishy, it's great to know how to neutralize their advantage.

An example myself. I love playing Annie, as she is highly underrated, never banned, and I can do consistently well with her. I've also had first pick my last few games, and since I was able to go mid, I picked Annie. Two of those games, I got ""counterpicked"" by a Kassadin and LeBlanc. This is where knowing how to counter them comes in.

1) Take teleport instead of ignite. You won't be on the offensive tons, so you'll want to push and roam, and be there to countergank if your lane roams.

2) Try to invade blue if you have an Ali or good hard CC and they don't. Annie has a decent, reliable nuke in her Q, and can pick up an early kill to put me farther ahead.

3) Trade whenever they have big moves on CD, and try to trade with stun up. This minimizes any retaliation, and assures you can outtrade them.

4) Most importantly, rush a Negatron Cloak, into Abyssal Scepter. They will be doing no damage, and with a potion, you WILL win the lane.

**TL;DR: Protip - Try to counterpick, but if you do get counterpicked, neutralize their advantage by adopting different playstyles, builds, and even lanes if you have to.**",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,badge-guide,True,t3_wmumt,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/wmumt/tip_for_everyone_learn_how_to_neutralize/,

This post is based on simple information, and some advanced. It will be build up in sections, hope someone will read it!

A) Invading.

A.2) Protecting your own jungle.

B) Ganking.

C) Counter-jungling.

D) Warding.

E) When to take buffs/objectives.

F) Taking the blame for everything.

EDIT: Added 2 more sections.

G) Picking your champion.

H) Picking the right items.

Let's get started!..

--&gt;

**A)** As a jungler, knowing when to invade the enemies jungle can be extremely difficult. Many junglers in solo queue decides not to do it, especially in the early game. No one wants to be the one pinging for an invade, and then proceed to lose 3 of your teammates.

If you want to invade, knowing the duration of your enemies CC and damage in level 1 is the most crucial thing. If you know you have more damage, more single target/aoe or even more CC, then go for it. Get your support to drop down their explorer ward, and then just run them over.

**A.2)** If you sucessfully achieve to steal the enemy blue/red buff, they will most likely seek revenge. Alot of junglers has that mentality; ""Hey, that was my goddamn buff... Screw you man, I'll steal something from you.""

If I ever manage to steal a buff from the enemy team, I will always go do my wraiths and then hurry back. Picking up 2 wards is crucial. I always ward the bush behind my red buff. Imgur image: imgur.com/T9mb5ye.png

**B)** Choosing what lanes to gank can actually be pretty hard. This is hard to understand for most laners, because they'll just say; ""Dude, you just have to come from the side and gank my lane.. It's easy.""

As a jungler, keep track of who wards and where they ward, is one of the ultimate tools. It takes practice but eventually you will start playing like, right eye on minimap and left eye on the screen.

As a jungler your also have the option to make the other team rage like all hell. I personally tend to camp a lane to the amount where they aren't worth more than 30 gold on assists. It's not for the money, but for the complete shutdown of an enemy lane and their mood. So often have I camped top or mid, and seen them being 0/3 after 5 minutes. The mentioned lane will 99% of the time go ""/all Yea, nice jungler I have.. Doesn't wanna gank when I get camped, GG -.-"" - This is the ultimate goal. It will create a terrible tention between that lane and the rest of it's team.

**C)** Counter-jungling is a good option, but a really dangerous one. Earlier in this post I mentioned backing for 2 early wards and using the one defensively. The other ward fits the enemy jungle perfectly.

I strongly advise you to not counter jungle if you don't have vision of the enemy jungler, or have his jungle warded. It's one of the worst feeling to stupidly getting jumped while finishing up an enemy camp.

**D)** Very short section. Communicating with your support about warding is a good idea. Make a deal with him. He wards dragon and enemy blue, and you ward baron and enemy wraiths. This gives amazing vision of the enemies, and can turn out to win you the game.

**E)** ""GO BARON GUYS, WE CAN TAKE IT OR FIGHT IF THEY COME"" This is extremely typical in solo queue, and probarbly one of the most popular ways to throw a game. Bad dragon and baron calls is something you just have to practice. When to take a baron/dragon or an enemy tower is not easy to figure out. I have a rule, and I'd like to share it.

I will never call for a baron unless we killed 2 of the enemies. It's so incredibly easy to stall out a baron, even 4v5, because that bastard hurts. ALOT.

**F)** This probarbly doesn't sound like a nice section, but you really just have to adapt to this. Basicially there are 2 rules (not always true) about the 5 roles on Summoners Rift.

1: No one gives the support credit.

2: Everyone blames their jungler for everything.

As a main jungler, I have learned to take all the sh*t you get, and just being nice about it. A perfect example is you killing your wolves while top is being killed by a gank for the second time in 5 minutes. He will almost always tell you how bad you are because you don't gank, even tho he didn't pick up a ward after getting killed from an early gank.

Calling them out on their lack of warding or skill is the stupidest thing you can do. If someone rages at me for the above mentioned reason I always say stuff like; ""Sorry man, I'm gonna come very soon."" If you manage to get a kill on the raging lane, then everything is saved.

I always take the blame for everything that happens, especially if someone dies from a gank and I have a ward in my bag. I will always tell my lane that it was my fault for not putting that ward down, and counter-ganking. This will balance out the hate. Ofcourse, if someone tells me ""Fuck you, I hope your mom dies and your sister gets raped"" I will instantly mute them. Behavior like that is not fair, and you should not put up with that.

**G)** If your new to the jungle, picking the right champion can be tough. Last season, when people asked ""I want to try jungling. What champion should I pick?"" People would tell them; ""Try giving Warwick of Fiddlesticks a spin."" The reasoning behind this is because of their high single-targert damage, and high sustain.

In this meta, tankyness and CC is dominating. This means that champions like; Hecarim, Volibear, Jax, Mundo and Amumu are all very strong and safe picks. I personally main Volibear, but find what fits you best.

**H)** Communicating with your support and occasionally yout other lanes about items, can benefit you greatly. Aura items are incredibly strong right now, especially items like Aegis&gt;Runic Bulwark and Abyssal Scepter. 

Almost every single support will pick up the Aegis of the legion and build it into Runic, and this is why I've seen so many double Aegis builds on one team, and buying those items for the personal stats, is just not worth it.

A very strong and solid build as a jungler can look like:

* Spirit of the Elder Lizard or Spirit of the Spectral Wraith (Depending on being AD or AP)

* Randuins Omen

* Spirit Visage

* Sunfire Cape

* Warmogs Armor

* Choice boots. 

As a jungler, most of the time your going to be the initiator. This means you will die as the first one most of the time, but if you made a good engage it doesn't matter, your team will most likely win the fight.


If there is a section anyone would like to know more about, just put it down in the comment section, and I'll add some pointers on it, but this is pretty much all the basic information you need to know about jungling.

Hope you guys like this, I'm out.

// Peace. :)

1361398738.0,55,self.summonerschool,18ww4e,Tips to help improve your adc play(long post),hamsword,65,10,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18ww4e/tips_to_help_improve_your_adc_playlong_post/,"Hi my name is hamsword and I have mained adc since i started playing this game, I played my first game with caitlyn and after that played her only from lvl 1 until level 23 when i picked up ezreal and graves. I have Played on teams that have been coached by professional managers/players. I see a lot of adc threads asking for help so I am going to post some of the things that most helped me improve my game. 


* Attack moving, one of things that i see that ad mains mess up is kiting, and this mechanic can also help with csing, in general this mechanic helps with you not mis-microing all the time too. If you hit A then left click it helps with kiting, csing, and makes it so you don't walk back into to their bruisers when trying to kite away from them and missing your right click. I never really right click to attack anymore because it leaves a lot of room to mess up. It seems pretty obvious but i have a plat friend who didnt even know a-clicking was a thing. its much like stutter stepping marines in sc2, and is probably the most useful of all mechanics in the game.


* practice every adc when you play. every day when I get on I play every adc in a certain order(if I have team practice that day) this increases your knowledge of all other adcs, and knowing how to trade with other adcs in lane sufficiently.

* keeping track of enemy's health pots/items. this is a huge thing in any lane, but in bot lane its probably the most important, if you have 3 pots and they have 1, you can force them out of lane much easier. If you have a bf sword and vamp and they just have vamp that means you can be much more aggressive to them since you will out trade them. Often times I ask my support how many health pots the enemy adc has so we can know when to go in on them. 


* always ward the lane bush if you plan to engage, this makes it so you cant lose vision on them if they try and run away through lane push this goes for any engagement throughout the map, if you ward the bush you wont lose vision on the person you are trying to chase down. I see a lot of teams on the 5s ladder do not ward when they engage, and since I play vayne a lot it really screws them over.


* In solo que, if you don't adc, play support. this also just increases your knowledge of general bot lane mechanics and lane matchups, supporting is very hard to do correctly, and if you know your lane in and out it will help alot. notice how people like loccodocco are now adcing, when they were support mains, and aphro now playing support its because they know all angles of their lane. 


* Bruisers, since bruisers are so popular in the current meta, its a good idea to learn them too, so you will know when most of them will dive you and how you can kite them, each bruiser has its own gap closers that they will use to catch you at certain times, and knowing the timings for when you should use your escape is key, or how to kite that certain bruiser. for example, xin will always use his e&gt;w&gt;q and will usually flash to get the knockup if its up, so using your escape after the knockup is usually the best option(my team keeps flash timers for situations like that) 


* ward timers can help a lot for ganks, if you know they warded tri at 3:00 it will be down and lose vision at 6:03 since there is a weird like 2 second period where when the ward falls it still gives vision. you can either catch the support when they are trying to ward or go for a gank/double kill on them both. 


* If you are having trouble in solo que, play team games, Having a confident support and team that can peel for you will take a lot of pressure off of you so you can focus on your game mechanics when you are practicing. I used to solo que every time I played, but now I play with a competitive team, and my skill level has gone up by a ton since I started playing in a team setting. 


* Do not go in If the enemy jungler has been mia for a long time, he could be camping your lane just waiting for you to screw up, a lot of times in pro play you see a jungler just sit and wait for minutes just waiting to catch them off gaurd, and there are two types of junglers, junglers that camp top, and junglers that camp bot and about 75% of junglers show their face bot the most. also if they lane gank once, they WILL lane gank again. 


* Knowing how to deal with lane swaps, if they initiate a lane swap, don't let it catch you off gaurd, ask your top if he can handle it, if he can, PUSH HARD AND FAST. If you take that first turret in a lane swap you will have a huge advantage, and it helps your top laner who is behind in farm catch up. sacraficing farm to push that turret isn't a terrible thing, but you need to push better then they can or you will lose the lane swap, a lot of teams can't handle lane swaps on the 5s ladder so there are a select few who do it every game and win by doing so. 


* FARM FARM FARM, if you are in a team setting, let the support do most everything for you, my support does like 90% of the work in lane, and I do most of the work late game, its a mutual understanding. I don't even really look at my map when my support is there, I focus on the enemy and my farm, my beautiful beautiful creeps that give me lots of gold. he asks me if I want to go in, and i say yes or no, he says jungler is here, i run. he says lets poke hard here, i say yes or no. 


* Snowballing your lane, if you get a kill early and can get an early bf sword, BE REALLLLLY aggressive, make that jungler waste his time in your lane, set the enemy adc behind and really press your advantage, you will poke them for way more then they will you, and you will make them lose more and more farm. 


* Knowing how and when to poke in lane, you don't just poke them whenever you can, because you can lose creeps for it, you always watch your creeps as well as theirs so you know when they will lose a creep from your aggression, or if you get poke on them they can lose a health potion for a creep and a health potion is 35 gold while minions give you much less, especially casters. coordinating poke with your support is very big in lane when with a sona or lulu, because you can really punish the enemy adc. 


bot lane is A lane that is very hard to master after learning. These are a bunch minor mechanics like this that can sway the lane in your favor, I am planning on making some videos to help people with mechanics like these but i Just wanted to make a post to help others out in the mean time.

1361247083.0,60,self.summonerschool,18sqvr,"RE: All current and future Mordekaisers out there, everything you need to know about your ghost.",carpaltaser,64,4,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18sqvr/re_all_current_and_future_mordekaisers_out_there/,"Quick start, for those of you who care about skill level etc. I'm currently Plat div 5, and I've played morde in over half my ranked games, so there, if that's important to you, idc, I'm just a guy who loves some Mordekaiser. But this isn't some catch-all ""laning tips and itemization"" thread. This is ult and ghost control ONLY (feel free to ask any morde questions in comments though).  

**1. Get the ghost**
First things first, ignore your teammates. Once you understand morde and your damage potential you'll know who you can kill and when. A jackass teammate will always complain if you didn't ult the carry, but morde is not about assassination. Look to ult targets when they fall under these categories:  

*low enough hp that ult will guaranteed finish them off  

*high priority target  

*the guy who's focusing you / someone with a lot of hp if you're gettin' messed up.  

You know the basics, the ghost you have has all that champions items and gets a chunk of your stats as well, lasts 30 seconds or so, etc.  What doesn't show up in the tooltips is that nobody on the enemy team wants to kill your ghost.  It's pretty beefy and it knows no fear. often times if it shows up in the middle of the teamfight, no one else will notice it except for you. (voice chatting with people helps them know to charge forward because got that ezreal ghost, or to retreat because you have failed.) Since people don't want to attack your ghost, when they see it ambling towards them, they tend to run. Maybe it's fear, or they're too busy at the moment, or seeing the lifeless eyes of their once trusted ally causes them to panic, idk. Regardless it brings me to my next point.  

**2. Who to ult**
Keep ignoring any teammates that don't like your pick of ghost buddy. There aren't any do-overs so make the most of who you got. And contrary to popular belief, ad carries aren't the only champ worth picking up. Now, by all means, try to get that carry. A carry ghost is phenomenal and I shouldn't have to explain why, but many other champs have their moments. Melee dps are fantastic ghosts. They hit almost as hard as the carry, and they're a lot easier to ghostify. And once you have a ghost, you make the enemy notice regardless of who it is.  

Imagine you're graves. You're doing great, good farm, all your allchat quips are well-received, and you've almost got that last whisper. Now imagine a riven is running at you, except this riven is different.  This riven has 2.4k health, no reason to live, and no one is peeling her off of you. She's not using skills so you've still got a good chance, but this riven gives no gold when you bring her down, and the enemy still has five champions left. Maybe you should just walk away from this one, at least for the time being. End scenario. You see what just happened there? Your ult just zoned the ad from the teamfight. That's pretty neat-o. It normally takes a whole champion to do that.  

Now take into consideration towers, something Mordes should always be doing. You don't need ranged attacks to kill at tower. Towers can't kite. Towers can't run. Towers just hit you back. So if it's time for killin' some towtows, all you have to make sure is you have a warm body there to help you. This is where one cool tip comes into play. Ghosts keep their character's passive, so champions like Nautilus (passive snare) and Jax (passive aspeed) and Yi (passive asshole) are great at hitting objectives. Not to mention ghost anivia turns into a ghost egg and that's just fking awesome.  The only guys left are AP carries and supports. Neither are great, but hey, Morde's ult is good damage, if that's what it's gonna take to kill their mid? Go for it. Not to mention early game, everyone's autos are about the same anyways. Supports... no. Don't... don't do it. If they're all alone and you feel like you could use some company, then sure. Then have him/her stand in a bush and keep watch somewhere while you go do more important things.  

**3. My ghost is so dumb D:**
He's not dumb. You're dumb. How does that feel? Ok I'll admit, the ghosts take commands very literally. If you tell it to stand somewhere, then goddammit it will stand there until its dying breath.  Here are two tips to keep up production.  

*Tip 1*: Set it and forget it. If you can Alt+right click a good target, the ghost can do alright by itself at that point.  

*Tip 2*: Live vicariously in Co-op. When you're in a practice game, once you get a ghost, just spend the time walkin' it around, maybe last hitting for you, kiting a bot. You could actually play annie and just practice with Tibbers. Also practice diving towers with your ghost. That ghost gets away with so much shit, and you get all the blame. Tower aggro, baron aggro, reports.  

*Tip 3*: This tip is pretty high level, you don't necessarily have to be able to do this, but if you can, morde ult becomes gamebreaking. Practice playing AD carry. Get good at moving between attacks, positioning, orb-walking, anything you can. Then when you using an AD carry as a ghost, you can go hide in a corner somewhere while your AD carry prowess cleans up the fight. I'm not joking. If you get the AD with your ult, move Mordekaiser to a safe position in the fight. That ghost is 90% of your dps and he dies when you do.  

Guys I love mordekaiser. Dude rocks. If I can even help one of you guys have a better game with him, it'll be worth it. I'd tried to make this post as expansive as possible, so if you feel like I missed something or just have general mordekaisers querys, let me know.

I want to start off by saying that I don't post a lot around here, but I've lurked for a while and learned a great deal, and I love you guys. I've played several games with some of you and it's been a blast, well, up until yesterday anyways...

I asked 4 people in the chat for join me for a 5v5 blind pick, so I gathered them up and we started, I guess they weren't listening, because instantly, someone said ""wtf? blind pick?"" which should have been my first red flag, I should have dodged there. 

But, whatever, I said ""Yeah, that's what I said in the chat...."" after this I proceeded to pick volibear with the intention of playing him bruiser bot, a tatic I employ often with him, it's extremely easy to feed your AD Carry with volibear bot.

After picking volibear, everyone seemed to think I was insane, they said we needed a support. I told them it would be fine, and to calm down. The person who had called TOP switched to kayle and said ""GUESS I'M SUPPORT"" to which I replied ""No... I can't solo top would you please go back to jax?""

Anyways. the game starts and he does switch back to jax. Everything is going pretty well for a bit. I'd like to pause and mention that everyone who I invited to this game had roughly 100 wins under their belt, where I had roughly 700. One of them wasn't even level 30. So I thought ""No big, it'll be a laid back game we'll all have fun""

So I started to feed vayne. Flipped caitlyn into her a couple times and at the 10 minute mark she has 2 kills and I've died once. Not too bad. This entire time the entire team was complaining about what a bad player I was for not going support, how we were gonna lose due to us breaking the meta... etc. It even got to the point where some of them were telling me to fuck off and that it was my fault we weren't going to win. (We were not yet losing at this point, mind you)

Well, and once a team starts to do this, once they start to fight themselves instead of the enemy, you've already lost. I pleaded for them to work as a team and stop complaining as it wouldn't solve anything, but they wouldn't stick together, and jungle fiddle just kept gankin' and killin'

I finished the game 3/8/16, giving up kills on multiple occasions because I knew my team mates needed it more. I tried my best to save people at times, and even when I DID save someone by running in and flipping someone, that same person complained about me dying. Oh, sorry for saving you, the AD carry, instead of me, the bruiser tank support guy. The entire rest of my team surrendered.

The bottom line is, if any of you are reading this, your attitude was horrid, and you should really be ashamed of yourself. Summoner School is suppose to be better then that, one of you even had the nerve to say ""BG"" at the end. That's just fucking disgraceful.

All that being said, I want to apologize to those people, if you honestly think I ruined your game, I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention and I've never had this kind of experience with /r/summonerschool before. The atmosphere has always been friendly and fun, and you guys were anything but that.

**So, now that I've told my story here's the discussion part: How do you think changing up the meta affects your own team? Do you think it's wrong to try something you know works if your team isn't on board? Should the goal of every single game to be to win and not to have fun? Personally, while I love winning, and always try my hardest to win, I feel that if you don't win it can still be a fun game, but blaming and inner-team conflict ruins that**

edit: I'd like to give props to dekar173 who got me playing rengar a 6 months ago. he was the original ""rengar"" player, and taught me how to play him. (max e first, spirit visage for CDR and endless sustain from W, lvl 2 all ins, how to triple q.)

***Champions***  

---

**Aatrox**

Aatrox, the Darkin Blade is in this build but will be turned on at a later date.

---

**Annie**

*We’ve made some changes to Tibbers to make him a tankier and more threatening presence in late game team fights beyond his initial burst damage.*

Summon: Tibbers

&gt;Tibbers’ Health increased to 1200/2100/3000 from 1200/1600/2000  
Tibbers’ Magic Resist increased to 30/50/70 from 25/45/65  
Mana cost reduced to 100 at all ranks from 125/175/225  

---
**Ashe**

*This change allows Ashe players to use her passive in more strategic ways beyond a level one poke or incidental crit.*

Focus

&gt;Ashe now gains 3/4/5/6 Focus stacks every second while not attacking instead of gaining Critical Strike Chance  
Ashe will critically strike on her next basic attack when she reaches 100 Focus stacks  
Initial Focus stacks are equal to Ashe's Critical Strike Chance  

---
**Corki**

Missile Barrage

&gt;Fixed a bug where Missile Barrage would sometimes fail to deal damage

---
**Hecarim**

*As a strong sustain fighter, Hecarim was blowing up squishy targets with Onslaught of Shadows’ high damage and on-impact fear. To balance the ability out, we’ve taken away the landing damage and shifted it to the riders that travel with Hecarim.*

*The Devastating Charge buff should let Hecarim jump over small walls and ledges to his opponents when he dashes to them. Keep in mind that when we say small ledges, there are only a few in the game like the river ramp ledges and very thin jungle walls.*

Devastating Charge

&gt;If Hecarim's target is beyond narrow terrain, Hecarim will now leap over the terrain to the target  

Onslaught of Shadows

&gt;No longer deals damage at the end location  
Rider damage increased to 150/250/350 (+1.0 Ability Power) from 100/200/300 (+0.4 Ability Power)

---
**Karma**

*Focused Resolve was impractical because whenever players wanted to use it, they needed the healing up front, not over time. This change still emphasizes the “leash break” gameplay, but now appropriately rewards Karma for using Mantra on her W and keeping her enemies close.*

Inner Flame

&gt;Mana Cost reduced to 50/55/60/65/70  
Explosion radius increased to 250 from 230  

Focused Resolve

&gt;Now correctly gives vision of the unit while rooted  

&gt;Mantra Bonus - Renewal  
&gt;&gt;No longer heals over time for 25% Missing Health  
Now heals Karma for 20% (+1% per 100 Ability Power) of missing Health immediately upon casting and another 20% (+1% per 100 Ability Power) of missing Health if the leash is not broken  

Inspire

&gt;Mantra Bonus - Defiance  
&gt;&gt;Fixed a bug where Defiance's mini-shields weren't applying the Ability Power ratio

---

**Kha'Zix**

*The changes to Kha’Zix are ultimately about giving him more viable choices when picking evolutions. Evolving Void Spikes granted such huge damage, high poke, and great utility that it was crowding out his other evolutions. Now Void Spikes gets a slow as part of the base skill, so its utility is there even at level one. Taste Their Fear’s evolution was previously reliant on having targets isolated. Now it works whether they are isolated or not, but does more damage against isolated targets, making it a more reliable choice. We also increased Void Assault’s damage reduction while in stealth to make it a slightly more enticing choice and to remind players of its additional utility.*

Taste Their Fear

&gt;Isolation bonus now increases damage by 45%  
Evolution adds 8% missing Health damage (Can be further increased by Isolation)  

Void Spikes

&gt;Now slows targets hit by 20% for 2 seconds  
Mana cost reduced to 55/60/65/70/75 from 60/70/80/90/100  
Bonus Attack Damage ratio increased to 1.0 from 0.9  
Evolution no longer consumes passive to apply effects--instead triples shot  
Can no longer be cast during Leap  

Void Assault

&gt;Damage reduction while in stealth increased to 50% from 40%  

---

**Kog'Maw**

Void Ooze

&gt;Fixed a bug where the slow wasn't reduced by tenacity  

---

**Lissandra**

*For a control mage with the kit she has, Lissandra was throwing out a lot of front-loaded damage. The intention of these changes was not only to lower her damage, but to also better highlight her in-fight control as her core strength.*

Ring of Frost

&gt;Cooldown reduced to 14/13/12/11/10 seconds from 18/16/14/12/10  
Mana cost reduced to 50 from 70  
Fixed a bug where the root failed to apply if Lissandra died  

Glacial Path

&gt;Cooldown now begins upon initial cast rather than upon recativation or at the end of the missile  

Frozen Tomb

&gt;Self-cast duration increased to 2.5 seconds from 1.5  
Slow increased to 20/30/40% from 20/20/20%  
Damage reduced to 150/250/350 from 150/300/450  

---
**Nautilus**

*If Nautilus gets ahead in levels, he ends up with both high damage and high tankiness when leveling Titan’s Wrath first. As a strong initiator tank with high crowd control, we’ve reduced some of that mid-game damage output so he’s less overwhelming when he snowballs.*

Titan's Wrath

&gt;Damage changed to 40/55/70/85/100 from 30/55/80/105/130  
Fixed a bug where the Ability Power ratio on hits was lower than intended  

---
**Poppy**

Heroic Charge

&gt;Spell has been refactored to better detect terrain

---
**Sejuani**

*Sejuani’s rework left her incredibly powerful in terms of overall damage and crowd control potential. We’ve tuned back some of those strengths to bring her more in line with other initiator tanks.*

Northern Winds

&gt;Bonus maximum Health ratio reduced to 10% from 16%  

Permafrost

&gt;Reduced slow duration to 1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds from 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3  

Glacial Prison

&gt;Reduced stun and slow duration to 1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds from 1.5/1.75/2

---
**Sona**

*Sona is a consistently strong support, so after we fixed a long-standing bug with Power Chord: Diminuendo we felt she would be a dominant pick without additional balancing. On that note, we’ve reverted some of our older changes to Sona. These changes are designed to maintain her parity with other supports by lowering her early game burst and her late game durability while making her a little more forgiving in the early game.*  


&gt;Base Health increased to 450 from 410  
Base Armor increased to 11.3 from 9.3  

Power Chord

&gt;Base Power Chord damage changed to 13/20/27/35/43/52/62/72/82/92/102/112/122/132/147/162/177/192 from 8 + (10 x level)  

Aria of Perseverance  

&gt;Fixed a bug where Aria of Perseverance's Power Chord: Diminuendo was not decreasing damage dealt  
Lowered the duration of Aria of Perseverance's Power Chord: Diminuendo to 3 seconds from 4  
Bonus Armor and Magic Resistance to self and healed ally reduced to 6/7/8/9/10 from 8/11/14/17/20  
Changed aura bonus Armor and Magic Resistance to 6/7/8/9/10 from 3/6/9/12/15    

---
**Thresh**

Death Sentence

&gt;Fixed a bug where Thresh could cast Flash while casting Death Sentence

---
Varus

Piercing Arrow

&gt;Fixed a bug where casting Piercing Arrow while targeting an enemy would cause Varus to stop moving  

---
Vi

Blast Shield

&gt;Fixed a bug where Blast Shield's cooldown at higher levels was 1 second longer than intended  

Vault Breaker

&gt;Fixed a bug where casting Vault Breaker while targeting an enemy would cause Vi to stop moving.

---
---
***General Champion Notes***

---

Targeted wall-jump abilities now check both sides of the wall for the closest location of the cursor, so players don't fail-jump into a wall, when the other side was clearly in range.  
We've added new targeting indicators to show how far the target is knocked back for the following abilities:  

&gt;Alistar's Headbutt  
Lee Sin's Dragon's Rage  
Poppy's Heroic Charge  
Vayne's Condemn  

We've improved consistency for abilities that behaved inconsistently when the targeted enemy uses Flash. We’re cleaning up these interactions so that either the ability won’t cast or Flash won’t be used up (it will be one or the other, never both).  

&gt;Jayce's Thundering Blow  
Singed's Fling  
Skarner's Impale  
Volibear's Rolling Thunder  

---
---
***Changes to Slow Zones***  

---

All slow zones now update on a quarter-second interval, meaning when you move out of a slow field, the slow will wear off almost immediately unless you’re hit by an ability that applies an individual slow (like Kog’Maw’s Void Ooze). What this means: your champion's movement speed will be restored more quickly when leaving a slow field, but the slow within the fields have not been changed.  

This change should make interacting with slow zones more intuitive while rewarding players who react quickly (as stepping out of a slow field will reward you faster). This is a small nerf to most of the champions affected, but we will be closely monitoring champions affected by these changes.  

The following abilities have had their slow refresh rate reduced to 0.25 seconds:  
&gt;Singed's Mega Adhesive  
Lux's Lucent Singularity  
Gangplank's Cannon Barrage  
Lulu's Wild Growth  
Miss Fortune's Make It Rain  
Trundle's Pillar of Ice  
Varus' Hail of Arrows  
Viktor's Gravity Field  
Vladimir's Sanguine Pool  
Lux's Lucent Singularity also applies a 0.25 second slow to targets hit by the detonation  
Kog'Maw's Void Ooze missile also applies a 1 second slow to targets struck

Hi, I’m Scarlex. I’m bad at this game. No seriously. Bad. However, I like to think I have a good understanding of the game concepts from time to time. I just have a hard time applying them.

The goal of this text is simply to explain the concept of meta, and its role within the LoL game and community. I will try to stay away from specifics and details of the meta and the game itself. This text is aimed mostly towards beginners but I do encourage anyone to have a quick read. 

This is in no way intended as a definitive guide to meta or how it works, but I hope it can serve as a start-up point for some interesting discussion.

Feel free to point out and/or yell at me for any mistakes I’ve made.

-----------------------------------------------------------

**What is this meta you speak of?**

If you look up the word in about any [dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meta), you will find that the term meta is derived from Greek, meaning “beyond” or “adjacent”. In English the term is adapted more to the beyond-part of the word, and essentially describes “X about X”. In a sense, this text is inherently meta as it revolves around the word meta, but doesn’t “delve into it”. Woah that's meta.

However, what does meta mean when we talk about League of Legends? Well, if we look at it from the meaning of the word, the LoL Meta is the “game surrounding the game”. By theory crafting, discussing, strategizing, even reading this, you are participating in the meta, the “game about LoL”. 

In short, *LoL meta is anything related to the game outside of the game itself.*

Now, the other meaning of the *meta*(from here on in italics) within the LoL community is what I like to call *the general macro-strategizing of the game.* Essentially, what we rely on when we yell at someone for not playing ADC in the bottom lane, and the theories that support the statement.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Why have a meta? Why Care?**

So, why does this *meta* exist at all? Well, the *meta* is *the most optimal macro strategies within League of Legends as perceived by the majority of its community.* 

Or as [PervySageMK](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19lbns/meta_the_whats_and_whys_long_read/c8pgu67) describes it:

&gt; META means Most Efficient Tactics Available. 

Pretty simple, huh? It’s what people think is the shit (“recking scrubs all nite”). Now, the last part *“perceived by the majority[…]”* is more of a disclaimer; Just because we don’t know about it doesn’t mean it’s not any less optimal.

An excellent example is the recent [AP](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ability_power) [Tryndamere](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Tryndamere) situation (as of early 2013): A build concept that has in theory been around for a long time is “discovered” by the community and incorporated into the *meta*. The strategies are of course backed up by theories that prove its efficiency. The reason you want a 2-player bottom lane is because it makes it easier to control/contest one of the global early-mid game objectives, the Dragon.

However, why should either of us give a flying fawk about what the other people within the community feels is the optimal way to play the game? Well here are some pointers on why you should/should not follow the meta: 

**You should follow the *meta* because:**

* It is the current theoretical optimal way to play the game in order to win.

* When grouped with 2-4 strangers, a generally known macro strategy lowers the required skill (micro-management/strategies) of each player in specific situations.

* Not adhering to the *meta* could result in negative reactions and lower morale among your team (sadly)

**You should NOT follow the *meta* because:**

* The enemy team might not be able to counteract the different play style (nobody expects the X)

* The *meta* is often reflective of the competitive scene within LoL, which means that the more you delve into the *meta*, the more individual skill is required. (Doesn’t matter how big the play was in your head if you couldn’t hit the stun. Doesn’t matter if you wanted to do 20min baron if you get outsmited by the enemy jungler.)

* Someone must boldly go where no Summoner has gone before.

* You play a game for fun. Being forced into a specific strategy isn’t always fun.

-------------------------------------------------

**Then why do people rage when I play [AP](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ability_power) [Varus](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Varus)?**

League of Legends is a highly competitive game, and it is often in everyone’s interest to win. Additionally, when you put a number on how good you are, shit becomes personal. It can be stupid and unfair, but that’s just how it works. However, you should not be deterred from trying new and interesting builds/champions!

It’s your leisure time and you should be able to decide what to do with it to a certain point. What I do recommend is that you take some time learning the build/champion in an environment where no one’s “special SWAGpoints” are affected (normal games). 

---------------------

**Interesting interpretations/views:**

[PabloEdvardo](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19lbns/meta_the_whats_and_whys_long_read/c8pfbiq)
&gt;Great post! As another interpretation, I might suggest that meta is like vernacular, dialect, or colloquial language.

&gt;There's a giant dictionary of all the words that we use, but how we combine those words to create meaning changes drastically over time.

&gt;If every individual drew their own conclusions on how to string those words together, we'd have a damn hard time communicating anything useful to each other. We'd spend more time trying to understand each person's individual ""meta"" than just getting the point across.

&gt;So while we have core game mechanics (damage, hp, mana, turrets, xp, gold, items, win conditions - the dictionary), how we combine those mechanics (champion selection, item build order, positioning - the dialect / vernacular) is going to vary.

&gt;So by establishing community agreed-upon standards, we get a lot of the tedious work out of the way and can go back to doing what we're really all here to do: play the damn game!

1361235521.0,57,self.summonerschool,18scc1,An often forgotten step to improve your game: Itemization ,Fearlessbunny,67,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18scc1/an_often_forgotten_step_to_improve_your_game/,"To give you some background, i'm currently a Diamond III EU-W Player (hopefully Diamond II tomorrow since i'm 1 win away from getting a qualifier, wish me luck). I play mainly AD, Jungle &amp; Top

One of the most basic things that people at all levels often do wrong is what items they buy, and when. Buying the right items and the right time can be absolutely critical yet it's not something that's talked or thought about much.

I see people doing mistakes with their builds at diamond, so it's not something that's exclusive to lower rated players.

It essentially comes down to

Should I buy defensive items?

Should I buy offensive items?

The best example to use is junglers, they are the ones who have to think about this the most. Let's use Xin Zhao as an example.

Xin Zhao has decent base damage, he scales incredibly well with armor penetration, AD &amp; CDR. He also has some innate tankiness from his ultimate if he can hit it on several people. 

If you break him down you realize you need to have some tanky items since he's often the guy initiating fights rushing into several people and he has to be able to survive a bit of focus fire to be able to do his job.

However, when jungling your farm is often quite limited, which means you have to adapt your build path depending on how the early game went for you

Did you get of a few successful ganks and land a kill or two, while keeping up with the farming? Then there's nothing wrong with going madreds &gt; brutalizer before building tanky. The tankiness from your R+levels will be enough and the brutalizer will help you just melt any AP/AD carry you jump on.

But it's not uncommon to not have such a great game, maybe you just got 1-2 assists, and some farm. Your simply not in a position to build a brutalizer at this point, you will be to squishy and will be utterly ineffective if the other team is doing their job. Which means madreds &gt; locket/warmogs is the way to go and you can follow up with a brutalizer/ghostblade after. This let's you initiate and absorb the punishment needed in a team fight, you will probably not be able to kill anyone 1 on 1, but you will force attention to yourself and that is the best thing for your team. If you just dash in and die after 1s you are completely useless.

Let's go for another example, I had a game a few days ago where my team had a Syndra who had to face a Kassadin. She was keeping the farm even, but Kassadin had gotten a kill on her off a gank, and picked up another kill in a dragon fight so he was ahead of her. I was watching her and his R+Q+W combo took off 60-65% of her HP and she was unable to put out any real damage on him, he could simply bully her around because he was doing to much damage. 

The thing Syndra did wrong was that she didn't change her item build from what she always builds. She went 2x dorans &gt; deathcap rush &gt; voidstaff. While the build itself is fine, it's not fine when facing a Kassadin who's that far ahead. Every single fight kassadin almost erased her from the fight before it even started. She was stuck at 20-30% hp unable to really go in and fight properly. Had Syndra gone Chalice/Athene &gt; Abysal she would've been able to deal with Kassadin much better, and while she would be doing less damage she would still have offered so much more in team fights than she ever could with her deathcap build.

When it comes to AD Carrys itemization you have to seriously consider what you need and build after that.

Miss Fortune is probably the one with the most diversity of all AD's. If I have a team with a lot of AoE like a Lux+Amumu combo I often go with a Bloodthirster+Black Cleaver build. This build is uneffecient in straight out auto attack DPS but it makes your ultimate hit like a fucking truck meaning your one goal is landing a good ultimate and wipe everyone of the map before you even have to auto attack. However if I end up with a team with close to 0 AoE where my ultimate will be less important, then I want as much single target damage as possible, thus I go IE&gt;PD&gt;LW. If I need a mix of AoE+Single target damage I go BT&gt;PD&gt;LW

Always think about what items you buy and in what order. Think about your team and the enemies team. What do you want and what do you need. Sometimes you want more damage, sometimes you want more utility and sometimes you just need to survive. Never stick to one set build that you never change

Do NOT ever put a point into anything till you are at the start of laning phase and begining to farm, maybe wait 20 secs after that even if you want to be super safe. Why? Often depending on what happens before minions spawn or even shortly after you may need a spell you dont usually pick first. E.g. Go for invade, enemy nearly escapes you flash ignite 10 health, you're irelia usually W first. Oh you havent put a point in anything ? Grab bladesurge pick up fb! 

Thats just one example and it will also apply as a defensive advantage specifically when getting early ganked or early invaded! So yea hold on to that one point because it could change all of the game!

",MileyCyrusNo1Fan,71,12,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tglvx/be_a_man_learning_to_trade_efficiently/,"Hey there everyone, Caleb ""Oskii"" Boese here with another write-up on League of Legends. I'm primarily a midlane player. This *will* be reflected in my writing: most of my examples will come from AP Carry vs AP Carry, but to be entirely honest they are perfectly applicable in any situation where you have two champions laying the smackdown on each other during the game [specifically laning but even junglers can find themselves in a lane from time to time].

Let me begin with a bit of a story about this all came about: I was playing with a group of friends I have, and we had queue'd up for a normal. We got in and I was first-pick. Cool beans! Bans went from side to side and it came to our picks. I had banned Ryze so I had little to no fear so I threw down the Veigar firstpick and staked my claim to all that is Man. The other team responded with typical picks and saved mid for last for some reason [why would you pick top instead of mid when you already knew what mid was? It baffles me.] The pick: Mordekaiser, the Master of Metal. The loading screen hits, and I'm formulating ideas on how to play the matchup: he's melee, so autoattacks shouldn't really be terror. Stuns should be pretty easy to land because he'll have to come in range to last hit, and otherwise I'll play passively and avoid his cone and be fine, right? Sounds legitimate.

It wasn't.

The first time a creep got low, he threw down his cone to last hit it, which hit me as well. Ow. That hurt. I threw an Autoattack-Q back at him and just scraped his shield off. He did it again, and again, and again. I'd burnt 3 of my pots to his 2: I was losing the lane and I was completely unable to farm up my Q. I still managed to win the lane with some help from some very strong ganks of my jungler, but damn did he hurt me while he pushed me under tower. I was so hurt that my farm was lacking and I was pretty sure my full combo would tickle the Purple Caster Minion.

After the game, I turned to my friend and asked for advice on the matchup. He's 2K elo so it's really nice to have someone like that readily available to answer my infinite questions. I'm aware I'm blessed. He said ""just zone him from the start and it's the easiest matchup you can play."" I didn't understand so I played him in a custom. It still wasn't working. I played Mordekaiser vs his Veigar and suddenly it was so very clear what my problem was. I was always looking for free harass. I wanted to poke them without taking damage. My main hero I'd played ranked and raised Elo with was Cassio, so it made sense. I liked poking them down from afar and only really getting in range when I'm about to lay down the law. Veigar is a different story; to trade with most casters you have to get in range. So how do we play this matchup?

**Low Elo players like myself have a hell of a lot of trouble just determining good trades and doing them.** What I felt like a hopeless lane against this Master of Metal, has actually become quite a simple task.

Some theory crafting to explain:
At level 1, Veigar's Q does around 70 damage. His autoattacks do 50 or so. Mordekaiser's cone does around 70 damage as well: in an AoE. His autoattacks do more, but he's melee. His abilities also *cost health.* If you start the lane on the wrong side of the creeps and autoattack Mordekaiser constantly while Q-ing him on cooldown he can't even think about retaliating. Autoattack+Q will do around 120 damage, his E does 25 damage to himself and 70 damage to you while generating around 20 shield. Even if he shields your next autoattack, you're STILL doing damage to him. Now he Es you again and does 70 damage, but you hit him with another two autoattacks and a Q. Sure, he's generating a bit of shield, but not nearly enough to even try and compete in the earlygame. You hit him with one combo before he gets shield up and he's forced to burn his first pot *already.*

So how do I apply this to any lane that's not Veigar vs Mordekaiser?

You make conscious decisions and quick calculations to **determine if you're going to come out ahead on the trade.** The first time you see your opposing laner, be sure to check *everything.* If you're midlane running Boots + 3 Pots, and you see a Doran's Ring: rejoice, for you have **450 hit points of sustain** and he has a bonus 80 hitpoints to trade with. Sure, he's got increased mana regen and some ability power, but 15 AP earlygame isn't going to make up for that ridiculous difference of 370 hit points of sustain. **Check his runes,** as well. If he only has 30 MR, he's not running MR Blues, you can be sure of that. What are his blues? Maybe he's going as glass cannon as possible and running AP Per Level blues. With your masteries and runes giving you a decent bit of Magic Pen [10% + 8.5 usually], picking up Sorceror Shoes is going to give you 28.5 flat MPen and 10% scaling MPen. To someone with only 30 MR, that might as well say ""true damage"" instead of ""magic damage."" Does he have really low armor? Like 10-15? He's probably running Mana Regen seals, and not armour. If you have a hyperaggressive AD jungler (I'm looking at you, Shaco) call for ganks and point out his *hilariously low armor.* The Shaco will see the free kill. He will take it gladly [point: if you're facing a Shaco, armour seals are a pretty good investment, FYI]. **Every time he comes back to lane, check what items he has and evaluate his damage output compared to yours.** [Also, check for number of wards and health pots. If he comes back to lane with two wards and ten health pots, trading isn't really going to work so well. Take the fact that he's dumped a bunch of money into health pots as an advantage in it's own right and only harass when it IS free, or look to play so aggressively as to kill him WHILE he's potting, and if he has a ward in his inventory, disappears to one side of the lane and comes back with a ward, make an educated guess as to where he put the ward and ping it to your jungler, with a timer on when it expires ""enemy wraith ward gone 1235"" is going to make your jungler love you. Holy digression, back on track now:] This comes with knowing the champions, but eventually you will have a good idea about how much damage each hero can do at each point in the game [hint: Veigar at level 6 with DFG can kill you pretty instantly from 100% if you don't build any health and MR]. Then it comes down to maximizing your effectiveness in every trade: autoattacking when you can in between spells. So here's a quick checklist for trading!

- Does he have more sustain than I do? [Health Pot Advantage, Spellvamp/Lifesteal items]
- How does our mitigation stack up? [Does he suddenly have Mercury Treads and a Negatron cloak? Maybe trading might be ineffective.]
- Does he have kill potential before I do if we trade [ie. it doesn't matter if you're trading well with a Veigar if you're ending at half health and his full combo is up and you're at melee range waiting to be Event Horizon'd.]?
- Is the jungler nearby? Either one, that is.
- Does he have any really hard CC that might negate my ability to trade?

Also important are:
- Who has more creeps? [In the very early game, a good trade might be made a bad one if you have 2 minions to his 2 waves of minions, because all those little smacks add up.]
- If I trade heavily and run low on HP or oom, will I end up unable to help take an objective? [ie Grabbing your blue, snagging Dragon]

And this time, since I've been getting a lot of PMs about how/when to engage with certain champion, I just wanted to address, in general, how and when you should engage someone for a **1v1** fight, meaning that these rules don't necessarily have to apply to 1v2s, 5v5s, etc., for there are many new exceptions that I'll cover in a later guide.

**Note** - This is just a general guide, so feel free to add whatever you think I missed or left out in the comments, you'll be helping me and the rest of the community out. Thank you.

**Note#2** - If you'd like for me to continue this mini guide series w/ a different topic for the next guide, feel free to PM me and ask whatever. I'm happy to help anyone out!

**Engaging Fundamentals**

When you want to engage someone for a 1v1 (usually meaning a fight to the death) you generally want to do so if one of these criteria are met:

 * Your enemy laner just used one of his/her major abilities and it is on CD.

 * If your enemy laner just used his/her only escape ability, can be Flash or can be Other.

 * If you have a CC advantage against your enemy laner, i.e. you have one that is much easier to hit than the enemy's CC, e.g. Ryze's Rune Prison (a target click) vs. Ahri's Charm (a single target skillshot)

 * If you have an ""item advantage"" on your enemy laner, i.e. you Based first and he/she's still in lane when you get back.

 * If you know your DMG potential and can ""burst"" him/her down in 1 or 2 combos, depending on your kit.
 
 * If you spot the enemy Jungler away from any position to help your enemy laner out.

 * If you ""catch"" your enemy in a very bad position in which he/she would have to ""burn"" an Summoner Spell to get away.

 * When you expect that your ""unique"" way of engagement will completely catch him/her off guard, e.g. walking close towards the enemy with only 2 charges stacked, as Annie, and then quickly using your Molten Shield to charge up another stack for you stun, and then engaging from there.

**Important** - All of these tips can only be taken into account if you are POSITIVE on your **DMG potential** which means, learn that specific champion that you're playing inside and out, from the DMG potential w/ certain items to the amount of ""punishment"" he/she can take from an enemy, etc.

I have been helping lower Elo people by duo-queuing with them on 2 of my other accounts. It has been very rewarding when you are able to help them. Contrary to popular belief, some people down in Elo hell are not all trolls/ragers, in fact, many of them are very nice and friendly! A lot of people stuck in elo hell are simply looking for a helping hand, some advice, a tutorial session. I am absolutely having a blast helping people out these days! However, I am only 1 person, and I am looking for more people to join me on this project! If you are interested, you can find me on RaidCall, just download it and register a free account. My username on RaidCall is: **ninjapandaNA** and the Group ID is: **4961622.**



**Why should I help these people in Elo hell?**
75% of the players are below bronze, and that's a big portion of the community! By helping them change their outlooks about being in a lower Elo bracket, you are reaching out to improve the attitude of a big portion of players!



**They are in Elo hell because they belong there!**
While this may be true, there are still players who were simply unlucky or messed up their placement matches. Think about it this way, if they deserve to stay down there, eventually they will fall back down. Your goal is not to carry them to 1250 and help them maintain. You are simply reaching out and helping them because you are genuinely a nice person!



**Sounds cool, I would like to help!**
This is for you if you:

Enjoy helping others in need

Are confident that you can help win a lower Elo game

Believe you have something to offer and teach to lower Elo players

Have Elo, not Ego

Don't care about potentially losing your own Elo on the account

Don't judge people by their Elo rating

Want to achieve a sense of self-fulfillment by making someone else's day


**Steps to get started!**

1. Go join the chat room called ""ninjapanda"" (I had been doing it as a solo project)

2. Download and join our RaidCall group for voiced communication. Raidcall id: 4961622

He started the game and went 3/1 against a Ryze top as Lee sin, with the ryze at 0/3/1. At this point, Ryze didn't even have a tear, and could not even contest a 2 dorans blade 1 longsword boots Lee Sin. He made a lot of errors, and if I didn't warn him about multiple things, he may not have ever affected the game with his early advantage.

When you're ahead, you have two choices. First of all, you can either push your lane and force your enemy to farm at tower, then roam to apply kill pressure. Now, your team can basically play as if they have TWO junglers, camping mid and bot respectively, or camping mid collectively. This is good if you have a really mobile champion with good killing potential (strong burst, reliable CC) or if the enemy wards poorly. The downside of this is that if your ganks are unsuccessful, you may lose time and have your lane catch back up. You also lose map pressure in your lane which may cause you to lose towers.

The second method, which I personally think is the most reliable and consistent one is to apply pressure to the enemy towers. Since you're ahead, you should find every oppertunity to zone and trade. If they trade, no matter what you should come out on top. You can either kill them, force them out of lane, or keep them so low that if they can't even effectively kill you under their own tower. If you focus on applying huge amounts of pressure on the tower, you do two things. First of all, you put damage onto the tower, and as anyone knows, towers win games. Giving an extra 150 gold to your ADC or support means an earlier BF sword or Sightstone. Taking down the tower also decreases the amount of safe locations where you can chase them to hell. 

The second most important one is that you force their jungler to camp you and not the rest of your team. This means that the rest of your team is free from jungle pressure and can play aggressive at all times while your jungler can gank. You also may even force their mid to hug top, rather than bottom, and they may miss some dragon opportunities. 

Now for a few tips on how to do this effectively. First, buy twice as many wards as before. Since you're top, and applying a lot of pressure, you can expect the jungler to come top soon. You want to see this early and waste the junglers time. Time wasted by the jungler means no exp or gold from them. If you're really strong, you can push the lane and hunt the jungler that you caught with your ward, while the top laner struggles to follow. If you're ahead 4/1, and the jungler isn't, you should easily be able to 1v1 him no problem. Furthermore, if you ward more, you can see more for the rest of your team, who can feel safer and play better. 

Second, buy TANKY items, not damage items. ""Why is that Tangerine?"" you may ask. ""I want to kill the enemy more and more!"". After 4 death streak, an enemy is worth even less than a tower, so why bother killing them? Instead, 150 gold for every member of your team is priceless. Buying tank items and sustain items allows you to sit under their turret and whack at it while they take potshots at you. If you're 3 levels ahead and a whole giants belt ahead, you can disrespect them all you want as long as minions are tanking the tower. You can heal it all off by lifestealing the next wave. You don't need to dive them and kill them under tower, you can just take the objective and make the game easier for the rest of your team. Furthermore, if you buy tanky items, even if you DO get caught you can survive much easier. Having 200 health from ruby crystal is enough to outlive an entire ignite + an auto attack or two.

Remember that League of Legends ultimately is about towers. You don't have to take the tower imediately, i.e. another option is just to freeze the lane and farm and deny your opponent, but pressure is the most important concept here.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1ijqr8,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ijqr8/how_to_take_advantage_of_an_early_lead_as_top_lane/,

Hi /r/SummonerSchool/, this will be my first post in this subreddit, and I just wanted to give an in-depth guide on how to get out of Bronze and an overview of going through Silver (as I’m not fully through yet). I’m sure there are plenty of guides already, but I wanted to put my own experience, and if it helps even one person, it’ll be worth my time. I’m just a Silver I player, so I’m not a pro, but I wanted this to be a guide to help those in the lower elo range, where some pros have not experienced at all or recently. This will be quite the wall of text so I’ll try to include a TL;DR. Please let me know if there are anything to add!
  
A little about me: I started the season with 900 elo (Bronze V/IV equivalent). I went 1-9 (W/L) for my placements, and losing all the way to 3-15 (W/L). It was quite demoralizing. While I was Silver (1300s) in S2, I didn’t actually belong there (I got carried from duo partners). This guide is basically what I learned over the period of 5 months, with 2 months training with a Diamond 1 player. While there are a lot of repetitive things, I’ll be sure to follow up and answer questions in the comments! 
 
Table of Contents:  
I.	Warding and Map Awareness  
II.	Laning  
III.	Map Presence  
IV.	Positive Attitude  

Let’s begin:   
I.	Warding and Map Awareness 

Warding is extremely important, as it gives vision of important objectives and allows you to know the position of the enemy team. With my experience in Bronze, sometimes it wasn’t that the laner wasn’t warding, but the fact that they do not watch the minimap. Without constant map awareness, it’s basically useless the ward. The best suggestion I would give is to take a peek at the minimap between CSing.   

When to ward is important because you can waste a lot of time on a ward when you know it’s safe. For example, as a top laner, if the enemy jungler was at bottom lane just a second ago, it’s not necessary to ward immediately (I would wait about a minute before feeling insecure). I’ll list when the first ward should go down for each lane (assuming you started with a ward), but this really depends on the enemy jungler’s clear time. This is assuming the jungler ganks after the first clear, but laners have to be cautious for a level 2 gank. This assumes the jungler starts at blue buff, if they are a red buff start jungler, use the other team color’s time (for example, if Shyvana takes red first, and you’re on blue side, use the purple team’s ward time).  
Top: 3:30 (Blue) | 2:00 (Purple)  
Mid: 2:00 (Blue) | 2:00 (Purple)  
Bot: 2:00 (Blue) | 3:30 (Purple)  

Ward locations are less important, but they do matter. Being lazy, there’s already a guide with images available (I have no affiliation with them):   
http://www.zyori.tv/newspost.php?n=2052  

II.	Laning  

There are many things about laning in Bronze that can give you a heavy advantage of the lane, which includes: map awareness (already covered), starting items, watching CDs, knowing your damage, knowing the enemy’s damage, knowing the gold difference. 

Hopefully, most people know not to start with Boots + 3 Pots, simply because the 25 MS bonus from boots does absolutely nothing. I would advise starting a high-sustain lane, even with the nerfs to the Pot limit. While each champion differs, I would recommend (for solo laners):  
-	Flask + 3 Pots (low risk jungler)  
-	Flask + 1 Pot + 1 Ward (high risk jungler)  
-	Cloth + 5 Pots (against AD)  
-	Rejuv + 5 Pots + 1 Ward (has an item to build out of Rejuv Bead)  
-	Mana Crystal + 2 Pots (Catalyst/Tear rush)  
-       Fairy Charm + 3 Pots + 1 Mana Pot + 1 Ward (high risk jungler)

These items don’t cover everything, but hopefully, it’ll give you a good idea on what start with (there are many combinations).

Next is knowing the enemy’s CDs. Bronze players often spam their skills with no regards to mana costs and cool downs. For example, if a Diana used her Crescent Strike (Q) to wave clear, it would be a good idea to trade with her immediately because it puts her at a disadvantage. This is extremely important at all elo brackets, and is a great skill to remember the general CD length of enemy champions (including their ultimate).

If you want to tower dive, you better know your damage. While practicing with my Diamond 1 friend, he constantly told me to know the damage of my champion. This allows you to go “man-mode”, knowing that you can escape after the tower dive. An example would be, if you had 300 hp as a level 5 Fizz, against an Lux with 400 hp, it would be bad to attempt to dive the Lux because without the use of Fizz’s Playful/Trickster (E), he should be unable to kill the Lux (without summoner spells). Same thing applies with knowing the enemy’s damage, which usually results from taking one of their combos, because many laners stay in lane for an extended period, when the best idea would be to recall. 

If you died twice to your laner, it would best be to play safe. Some people never learn. They go back to lane with the same thought that they’re not at a disadvantage, which results in them dying again. Many times, champions can snowball really hard with a 600 gold lead (also with the extra exp/denial). Levels make a big difference, since it provides free stats.  Being a level behind often results in a huge disadvantage, where you should not hard engage with the enemy.

III.	Map Presence  

Being in any lane, maybe besides bot lane, you should be roaming the map if you’re ahead. Warding the enemy jungle can allow you to catch the jungler and kill him (but caution of backup from laners). Mid laners really need to roam because it’s one of the sole reasons they are there. AFK farming can be good at times, but it would be advised to shove the lane and roam.
Be sure to let the laners know that you are ganking. In Bronze, this could require to ping there lane several times as well as let them know by typing it out. If they don’t respond with getting closer to the enemy (preparing to engage), it would probably be worthless to bother ganking (unless you are massively ahead).

IV.	Positive Attitude 

I admit it, I do rage at times. However, that’s rare because I attempt to control my emotions. Raging causing your entire team to get ticked off, leading to disagreements and AFKs. There will be AFKs and leavers in Bronze, no doubt, but there is the same chance of that happening on the enemy team. It’s not your goal to get your team to be better, but yourself. If you are going 30/0/0 every game, you should be climbing. Many often claim they do very well in the past few games, but when I check their KDA, it’s horrendous. It’s best to be a stable and gradually increasing player than to rely on luck of being better than the enemy laner and stomping. While that was a bit off topic, it’s best to mute your team if they are aggravating you and not to respond. I would advise turning off all-chat because there is simply no point in having it on besides getting ticked off.

For now, that’ll top off my mini-guide. I hope it helped in some way. Consider changing your mindset from “play to win” to “play to improve”. Your elo should gradually rise as you play more games, which should bring you to your “true elo”. Just 50 ranked games won’t tell much if you’re in Bronze. Don’t worry, and be happy!

Have fun in SoloQ!

Feel free to add me if you want to chat (NA)! Cheers!  

TL;DR: Be sure to ward a lot and watch the map. Be sure to know when to get objectives (towers, dragon, baron) if there is an opportunity. Watch enemy cooldowns, and know their damage. Most importantly, know your own damage. Be sure to roam and gank other lanes (be sure they know). Stay positive! Being a rager decreases your chance of winning. Have fun and play to improve (not to win)!

1357434148.0,51,self.summonerschool,161agh,20 tips on how to get better at league.,chri872y,65,14,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/161agh/20_tips_on_how_to_get_better_at_league/,"First of all, here is a video. Easier than reading:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glRW0-0HzPI

Alright, here is the tips:
 

1. Deaths. If you die too much, the enemy team will end up getting more gold and experience than you. So the obvious answer here is to not die too much.


2. Raging. If you rage at your team, you are the bad player. Sorry to say this, but if you dont rage you have a higher chance of winning games. The reason behind this is simple. For example, if a guy told you that you suck ass and you should uninstall this game now, are you going to play at your full potential? No, you're not. If nobody rages, everyone would be happy. But i am not going to go into detail about this, because Athene already talked about this. Athene's video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7mPlpu4Zmo
3. Last hitting. Last hitting is one of the reasons that pro players are... You know, pro. Learn to last hit. The easist way to learn this, is loading up a custom game and trying to last hit as many creeps as possible.
4. Getting caught. If you go around the map on your own little adventure, and you're going alone. Chances are that they have a ward there, and you're probably going to die soon. I have a great rule, and that is to always look at the map. How many players are missing? If its over half their team, you should get out of there as soon as possble. But if its just their support, hes probably just warding. But beware, they may come unexpected.
5. Learn to play your role. For example: I am the top laner for my team, so that means I am learning top lane. ( I have a video of me playing Yorick, if you want to see me play. Ill put a link in the description and add a annotation. ) But if you main mid, master that role. Do you like jungling? Master that role.
6. Know how to play other roles. Even tho being the best at whatever role is your favorite role is great, you NEED to know how to play other roles. You cant have your favorite role all the time. Sometimes your team needs a Jungler or a Support but no one wants to take that role. Thats where you step in and take one of those roles.
7. Do not play champions you are bad at playing. If you are bad at playing a specific champion, then dont play that champion. Theres multiple champions for each role, pick one you are good at.
8. Learn/ Study each matchup! This is very important to learn. For example: You dont play Darius against Teemo, Teemo simply outranges you and you are a melee champion. Sometimes you may be lucky tho, and that Teemo is bad at that specific champion and you win the game. A good website for figuring out who counters who is: http://www.championselect.net/ But you still need to learn who counters who, if you want to go pro.
And just because you counter, does not mean that you win your lane.
9. Cheer up. You cant win every single game, so if you lose you made some mistakes and the enemy took advantage of that. Everyone makes mistakes, even the pro players.
10. Never surrender. Do not give up until your nexus is dead, you may make a great play. Or take advantage of a mistake the enemy make and eventually win that game!
11. Be a team player. Dont be that guy that never helps. Help your damn team, even if you miss that blue. If you see your team in a fight, go help them!
12. Mechanics. Improve on your mechanic skill. If you lack some knowledge, go learn what you are missing out on!
13. Winning your lane. ""Win lane, win game!"". That quote is actually true, because if you win your lane you have time to roam, helping your team out. That results in your team having the advantage and eventually winning.
14. Wards. ""Wards win games."" That quote is also VERY true. If you have vision and the enemy dont, you know where they are and when. It prevents you from dying because you can see more on the map. BUY WARDS PEOPLE!
15. Map awareness. This. If you NEVER look at your map, you might aswell run into the enemy team and suicide. Look at the map very often, and never forget this.
16. Copy the best, and become one of the best. This is also very true. The best almost never lose, so if you copy what they do, you should not lose more games than you win. That eventually raises your elo. But, how do you copy the best you may say. Well thats easy: Watch their live streams!
17. Learn your champion. If you favorite role is mid, find a champion you REALLY like and master that champion. Then find 2 more champions you like and master them. Know atleast how to play 3 champions per role.
18. Take advantage of you advantage. You got fed and you have a 5/0, but that does not mean you can solo their entire team. Dont ever be overconfident and cocky.
19. Experience. If you have 200 more games played than your enemy, you are at an advantage. You should know more about the game, and your role in general.
20. Objectives over kills. Taking down an objective like Dragon, Baron or a tower benefits your whole team, but a kill only benefits the ones who helped killing the enemy.

Stuff I forgot because it comes naturally to me:

* Extending 7: Sometimes you are bad at a specific type of champions, and its hard to learn them. But its true that if you enjoy playing a champion, you should learn it via experience.
* Extending 16: You learn something by watching streams. Most of the time, the pro players explain what they did or are doing.
Thats why i included it.
* Great video for 4. (Thanks Deylar419): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_qxqKjkuug
* To expound on 1, if you die once, don't let it snowball further and die again. You have to play more cautiously and recognize that the enemy is ahead of you in gold and xp now. Dying once is manageable usually, but not if you don't adapt.

That's what that beating in your chest is.


These tips form a holistic guide to pregame prep and getting yourself in the right headspace for jungling.

You want to be in a positive spiritual zone when you play League of Legends because this is a community known for its eternal optimism and compulsion to nurture. If you can't pay it forward and reward all of your fellow travellers with the same love, understanding, and unfettered encouragement they show you, what is the point of going on? There is no point. And so,


Tip #1

Drink a ton of herbal tea. You'll know you're ready to play when your urine has become so completely clear that when you look into it in the toilet bowl you see crystal clear visions of the future. It might be an alternate future, you won't know, but it will be a future where everyone is wearing winter coats and the air seems crisp. Somehow, no one seems cold, though-- just thrilled to be alive. You'll see this in your urine, and you will know that you have reached a state of relaxation conducive to the intense responsibility of piloting a cartoon through the video game woods.


Do not gaze at the vision for too long, however. I made that mistake once, and it took me to a dark, dark place and I learned things that would break a lesser man. I say that not to boast, but simply as a warning. This horrible knowledge I carry with me is a heavy burden.


Tip #2

Once you have reached the clarity described in Tip #1, begin eating beets and eat nothing else for the remainder of the day. This will stain your urine red, obscuring the horrible truths you might otherwise be tempted to gaze at.


Tip #3

Build a small shack in the woods using only your bare hands and materials you can gather in the daylight hours of a single summer day. It is within this shack that you will embark on your jungle journey, one step closer to full jungle attunement. Don't worry if the shack offers poor protection from the elements. As the rain runs down your face, bringing with it bits of moss and filth from the sticks and mud you used to construct the shack, you will be at one with the jungle. When the opposing jungler moves, you will feel it in the depths of your soul. This will be useful for counterjungling.


Tip #4

Talk to the wind.


I know, it sounds like some ridiculous new age ritual, but if you don't do it like a yuppie, the wind will answer. The wind hates yuppies and never answers them, so if you truly are a yuppie, you must quit your job and spend some time aging so that you are no longer young or professional. You've already built a shack in the woods, so I'll assume that the urban part is not an issue.


The wind will always want to go off topic. It is really into model trains and will go on at length about the virtues of different styles of freight car, but if there is enough herbal tea in your system and enough filthy rainwater in your soul, you will have the fortitude to keep the wind focused on letting you know rumors it has heard from lanes afar. This is key in deciding which lanes to gank or whether you should just try to farm for the moment.


Tip #5

Breathe as little as possible. This will help keep your hands steady. You've heard of monks who live in the mountains and are able to derive all the nutrients necessary for their survival from breathing the fresh mountain air. With practice, you will be able to derive all the oxygen you need from the food you eat. It is easy to fall into the trap of eating especially fluffy foods, but this is a crutch that you will soon leave behind. In my present condition, I can survive for hours on the oxygen I absorb from a single, small piece of rich, dense peanut butter fudge. Remember, however, to only eat beets.


Tip #6

Immediately ignore every single person on your team. This one is obvious, but I thought I'd add it anyway.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_v23nu,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/v23nu/extensive_guide_to_holistic_pregame_jungle/,

On a similar note, she has very little chasing capability.

I suppose this would be the time to ult and chase them down, but that's operating under the assumption that they aren't running to the safety of their team.

However, let me give a quick example of the game I just played where I got raged on.  Me (Taric) and Graves bottom lane.  His ult is on cooldown from killing the support (Sona) and it's 2v1 in the bottom lane with Ashe.  She gets careless and gets too close to the brush, so I go in and land a stun while Graves is still pretty far back behind the wave.  Graves does his dash and let's loose his Q (hits with 1 of 3 canisters) while I run in and shatter/ult.  This knocks Ashe down to about 20% health and when the stun wears off, she hits us with her slow and dashes for her turret with both of us close behind.

The stun happened right around the middle of the lane, and as she takes off we pursue and Graves gets in another AA that brings her damn close to dead right as we get near range of the turret.

At this point, my stun comes off of cooldown right as I hear the ping from the turret signaling that it's going to stop attacking me.  I can't survive many turret hits at this point, so I let loose my stun and instead of freezing her for Graves to go in and mop up it kills her.

Then he (Graves) goes off about how she was so close to dead and all I had to do is go in there and tank the turret so he could get one last shot off.

So was I right, or did I mess up?  If she had stopped running when she got to the turret he would almost certainly have gotten the kill and gotten away, but there's a good chance that I would have died from the turret afterwards.  Also, if she had kept running then Graves wouldn't have been able to get a hit in until/unless his dash came back up to close the distance.  I was almost certain that I should go for the stun at the time, but maybe I'm wrong and it would have been worth my death/her escape to give Graves a chance for an extra kill.

His ultimate, available from level one, changed him from hammer stance (melee) to cannon stance (ranged). In hammer stance he has a jump that slows, an AoE DoT and a knockback that deals max %HP damage. In cannon stance he has a skillshot, an AS buff for three attacks, and a gate that speeds up people that pass through it. If the skillshot is shot through the gate it gains extra speed, range and damage. His poke and burst can be very hard to deal with, but he has no sustain and does badly in drawn out trades. Found in top lane. Average difficulty.

**Karma**: Medium-ranged magic damage support mage thing. Her ultimate is called Mantra and charges up over time to a maximum of two. She can expend Mantra to give her other three abilities an extra effect. Her Q, a cone that damages, also heals people inside with Mantra. Her W, a shield, damages people around the target. Her E, a bind that damages people it hits and speeds up allies/slows down enemies, gains double speed. Whilst being crappy, her burst is pretty high, so beware. Her passive grants extra AP based on how low her HP is, so watch out when she's low. Not found often, although when she is she is usually mid or support. Average difficulty.

**Karthus**: Medium-ranged sustained damage caster with good global presence and farming ability. Deals magic damage. Q is a very small spammable AoE that does double damage if it only hits one person. W is a wall that slows and reduced MR. E is an AoE DoT. His ultimate is a channeled spell that, after three seconds, damages all enemy champions on the map. After death, his passive roots him in place, makes him invulnerable, and he can continue to cast spells at no mana cost for a further seven seconds. Karthus is an excellent farmer between his Q and E. Bear his ult in mind if you drop low in another lane. Found in mid lane. Average difficulty.

**Kassadin**: Melee, magic damage assassin with excellent mobility. His Q is a single-target damaging silence. W passively grants mana back on hit, and deals magic damage on autoattacks when activated. E is a cone that slows and damages, and can be used after six stacks, each stack being gained when a spell is used nearby. His ultimate is a low-cooldown blink that damages. Its mana cost stacks if used repeatedly in a short time frame. His passive grants attack speed when he takes magic damage. Try to bully him before level six, as he gets a lot of his burst then. Be careful when he is MIA as his roaming potential post-6 is very good. Found in mid lane. Fairly high difficulty.

**Katarina**: Melee, magic damage assassin with high mobility and burst (hehe). Manaless. Her passive, when she obtains a kill, reduces all of her cooldowns by 15 seconds. Her Q is a targetted nuke that bounces to four other people and marks them. This mark procs and damages whenever Katarina damages a marked target. W is a spammable AoE that grants MS if it hits a champion. E is a blink that can be used on allies or enemies. Her ultimate is a channeled spell that damages nearby champions over time. Despite her high burst, she is very susceptible to CC. Try to cancel her ultimate as soon as possible using a stun, silence, knockup or knockback. Found in mid lane. Fairly easy to use.

**Kayle**: Melee ranged physical magical damage support carry. Seriously. Her passive shreds % defensive stats per autoattack. Q is a single-target nuke that slows and amplifies damage on that target. Her W is a targettable heal that grants MS. Her E changed her from melee to ranged for ten seconds, gives her magic damage on-hit and a small splash range. Her ultimate is a targettable bubble that makes the target invulnerable to all damage for a short time. Despite her highly ambiguous kit, she is usually best played in top lane as a bruiser or carry. Use her ult when you would prevent the most damage, not to save someone in the nick of time. Found everywhere, although mainly top. Fairly easy to use.

**Kennen**: Medium-ranged magic damage caster with an emphasis on AoE. Uses energy. His passive puts a mark on someone every time they're hit by one of your spells. Three marks and the target is stunned. Q is a skillshot that is blocked by minions. E grants movespeed and defensive stats at the cost of not being able to autoattack, and in addition damages and marks everyone you pass through. W grants bonus damage and a mark on every fifth autoattack, and when activated, hits all marked targets in the vicinity. His ultimate creates a field around him that strikes champions inside. Kennen will often try to initiate using his E. Therefore, time your hard CC for when  he uses it. Found in mid and top lane. Average difficulty.

**Kha'Zix**: Melee, physical damage assassin. His passive gives him bonus damage on his next autoattack against a champion every time he passes out of sight. Q is a short-ranged nuke. W is a skillshot that heals if he is near the impact. E is a jump that deals damage. His ultimate lets him stealth twice for a short amount, and also gives him an evolution point, which he can use on any of his skills. When evolved, Q gives extra autoattack range and gains %HP damage, W fires three skillshots that apply his passive, E gains extra range and resets on kills, and his ult gets an extra stealth. He will often max W first for the amazing poke it offers. Try to CC him and burst him as Kha'Zix is normally built glass cannon. Found in top, mid and jungle. Average difficulty.

**Kog'Maw**: Long-ranged artillery-themed AD carry. His passive gives him a short amount of time after death to run around, after a couple of seconds he explodes dealing true damage in an AoE. Q is a nuke that shreds resists, and passively grants attack speed. W grants extra range and %HP damage for a short time. E is a skillshot that slows for a duration after it is fired. His ultimate is a short-cooldown, long distance AoE that reveals. Its mana cost stacks up if used in succession. Despite having entirely AP scalings, he is best used as an AD carry due to the range and damage on W. Try to trade with him when W is down. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**LeBlanc**: Medium-ranged, magic damage assassin with huge burst damage. Her passive grants a clone when she falls below 40% HP that lasts a few seconds. The clone cannot cast spells and its attacks do not deal damage. Her Q is a single target nuke that marks them. Using another spell on a marked target procs it, silencing them and dealing more damage. W is a blink that damages, and can be re-activated to return to the original spot. E is a skillshot that slows the first target it hits, snaring them after a second if they remain in leash range. Her ultimate duplicated the last spell she used, and also gives bonus damage. Her usual combo is QR, followed by W or E. Her roaming potential is excellent. Banshee's Veil is a good counter item. Found in mid lane. Hard to use.

**Lee Sin**: Melee, physical damage bruiser that uses energy. Each of his spells have a secondary effect that can be cast in the three seconds following the first cast. His passive makes his next two attacks after a spell cast hit faster. Q is a skillshot, with the second cast jumping him to the target and dealing damage based on their missing health. W is a jump that can be used on allied units, and also grants a shield to both targets. The second cast grants him armour, lifesteal and spellvamp. E is an AoE that damages and reveals, with the second cast slowing all hit targets' MS and AS. His ultimate is a melee nuke that knocks the target back, also knocking up anyone that the original target hits. His early game damage is very high, but given his high-utility kit, come late game he also makes an excellent peeler. You can jump to wards using his W, which makes them even more valuable. Found top and jungle, also occasionally mid. Hard to use.

**Leona**: Melee support tank with excellent crowd control. Her passive marks targets whenever she casts a spell. This mark can be procced by other champions for bonus damage. Q is an autoattack modifier that deals bonus damage and stuns. W is a resist buff that after three seconds shoots out an AoE, dealing damage. If the AoE hits anyone, she gains the resist buff for a further three seconds. E is a skillshot that damages everyone it hits, also pulling Leona to the last champion it hits. Her ultimate is an AoE that slows and damages everyone it hits, whilst also stunning people in the centre. She functions very well with aggressive AD carries like Graves and Corki. During teamfights, try to use your Q and ultimate to stunlock important targets. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**Lulu**: Medium-long ranged support with high utility. Her passive, Pix, fires out three bolts on every autoattack, dealing magic damage. Her Q fires two skillshots, one from her and one from Pix, that slow and damage. W, on allied cast, speeds them up and gives them bonus AP. On enemy cast it turns them into a cupcake/squirrel/dragon, reducing their movement speed and stopping them from casting spells or autoattacking. E, on allied cast, shields them and transfers Pix to them, giving them the passive. On enemy cast it nukes them and puts Pix on them. Her ultimate gives an ally HP, knocks up enemies around them, and gives them a slowing aura. You can combine her E and Q to put Pix on an enemy and fire the Q from that location. Her W can be used to cancel channeled ultimates. Found in bottom lane. Fairly hard to use.

**Lux**: Long-ranged magic damage caster with good supportive capabilities as well as burst damage. Her passive grants spells a mark, which can be procced with autoattacks for bonus damage. Her Q is a skillshot that snares the first two enemy units it hits. W is a skillshot that shields allied champions, both on outward journey and inward. E is an AoE that slows and reveals, which can be detonated to deal damage. Her ultimate is a long-ranged laser that procs her passive and deals heavy damage. Her Q is quite easy to avoid, but if you are caught by it Lux can follow up with (ahem) tons of damage. Her ultimate's cooldown gets very low with CDR, so keep in mind when playing and playing against her. Found in mid lane, although sometimes supports.

I just played a normal draft pick game with 3 summoner school members from chat and then a 5th random person. We had a 5-0 lead until we admittedly threw a couple teamfights and ended up back even. Now there was a SS member who i will not name that was carrying pretty hard and complained constantly about us throwing. Going on and on about our AD's build and how we didn't know how to teamfight etc. etc. He/She started surrender votes every chance they could even though the game was easily winnable. I understand that having a rough game can infuriate someone but try to help your fellow SS members, not rage at them. Not everyone is as good as you are. If you are carrying your team, tell them how they can do better. Constructive criticism is 10x better than just raging at them trying to get a surrender. Peace out and see on the Rift.

Edit: I didn't want this to turn into a back and forth between participants which is why I didn't name the player, but it has. This was only meant as a reminder to high ELO SS members.

A few reminders on this occasion:

* Please don’t idle in the summoner school chat room. We (for the first time) are consistently filling the room, and until we work out a solid plan on how to deal with this issue, idling in the channel will only hurt the people who are actively using it. Likewise with the mumble server. As we work to expand it (I might have to front the money myself), we still only have 50 spots. Please don’t idle their either. If you aren’t using it, please disconnect and allow others the opportunity to use this valuable resource.

* Upvotes and downvotes. Upvotes help get questions answered. Downvotes are not a ""I disagree with this sentiment"". Please be mindful when you distribute the DV's, because some people take imaginary internet points seriously.

* If you are in this community and have a valuable skill to share, please don’t be shy. We are dedicated to improving each other, and what better way to do that than to share our tips, tricks, and secrets. 

* Please be kind. Whether it be in game, mumble, or in a chat room, please be mindful of your intonation and your wording. Being nasty to one another is not what we want to perpetuate. We need to be better than the rest of Riots fan base. Why? Because League of Legends is not X-Box live. Friendly ribbing is ok, but being demeaning to one another does nothing but drive a wedge between us.

1373548568.0,54,self.summonerschool,1i2t5b,Lee Sin main with some tips!,Wakanaga,64,10,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1i2t5b/lee_sin_main_with_some_tips/,"Hey /r/summonerschool. Been an active League player for close to 3 years now and Lee Sin was one of my first champion purchases and since then I have easily played over 500 games with him. This will be a mixed bag of tips (skill level wise) and I just really enjoy what this sub stands for as I see League being an ever growing pool of knowledge to dive into and having the drive to learn and learn is great! So I want to help.


1) When playing mid or top Lee Sin securing a kill at level 3 is the easiest thing in the world. You want to have a skill point in all your abilities and flash. Hopefully you have won a trade or two up to this point so they should be around 75% health to make it even easier. And if you hit level 3 and can do this while they're level 2 that's just icing on the cake! Just W up to a minion they are last hitting if they are melee or a minion nearest to them if they are ranged (I habitually double tap W literally every single time I use it and through proper auto attack management don't run into energy issues). Start with an auto attack or two and then hit them with E (knowing how many autos to squeeze in comes with practice and if they have escapes, how far away they are, their health, etc.), hopefully you can get one more auto in and then E again for the slow/auto attack slow if they decide to stay and duel the first blood out. During all this time you want to be moving in between autos to a position where you can Q them with no minions in the way. First thing they get around 50% health you use the first part of your Q, ignite, then auto. At this point most people realize they are dead and will try to flash away. Simply use the second part of your Q, auto attack them once and enjoy your kill! This works so well because at 50% no one is too panicy about dying and still willing to trade some blows. They realize you plan on killing them once your Q is on them and by that point it is too late! Really hard for an enemy to outplay this with proper runes/masteries and execution.



2) Never get stuck in which ability you should max first! When laning with Lee I find myself maxing all 3 in different situations. If you're up against a middle that is running health or ap Seals then you for sure want to max Q. Getting a mid laner to half health through a few autos and an E with some minion help is super easy. At level 6 against a squishy at half health you just have to land one Q on them and they are dead. Q to them. Auto. E. Auto. Ignite. Ult and they will fly away run a few steps then die from ignite. When I top Lee against any bruiser/tank I usually find myself maxing W. Super short cooldown on a shield that becomes substantial quick and the lifesteal is invaluable for winning trades and sustaining in lane. You can W to a minion they are about to last hit to deny it (Makes me miss DOTA) multiple times a wave and can be super annoying. I do rarely find myself maxing E but against someone like Tryndamere it can be great. The auto attack debuff really matters for trades and if you build Hydra Lee your wave clear is super good with a maxed E.



3) When jungling Lee your IDEAL gank would be a gank laid out the same way I try to get my First Blood. You always always want to try to W to them if you can. It is the best way to get max damage out (execute mechanic on second use of Q) and you don't have to land a skillshot from max range, just have to hit it once you're in their face and they are slowed. 



4) The way I ward hop with Lee is kind of different from most people I have seen and talked to and I don't know if it will work for you but it definitely works for me. I always put wards in the same slot (please make it a habit) and keybind that slot smartcast to Shift W and I have smartcast W bound to just hitting W. I can just double tap W, first time with Shift then just take the pinkie off and hit it again. This becomes super easy and quick to do with just a little practice on timing with your pinkie. I messed around with hitting C for the ward with my thumb then hitting W with my middle finger in a kind of rolling hand motion that worked well but I found it kind of clunky since I want to hit spacebar or alt with my thumb subconsciously.


5) My build paths for Lee are always different when I lane. But when I jungle I pretty much have one build path, Elder Lizard, Merc Treads, Bulwark, Randuins, Last Whisper, last item up as needed thought it's usually Ruby Sightstone (I sometimes buy this way earlier if I'm getting real fed. I find myself only needing 1 or at the most 2 wards per back for most the game so I don't like to blow all the money on a Sightstone early but late game you can ward hop like crazy and you can never have enough vision when anyone getting caught once spells gg. I like to carry early and steal kills, make plays which all you need damage wise is Elder Lizard to make that happen. The true damage really hurts and you have insane AD scaling that makes that little bit go a long way. I then try to transition into a disruption tank/adc peeler for mid late game. That requires some tankyness.


5) Team fights with Lee can be hard to determine on what you should be doing. If you're going carry Lee Sin then you will find yourself generally pretty useless once late game has started. Your holysh*t damage requires perfect execution in a cluttered team fight which honestly isn't going to happen that much and you are super easy to shut down with a single Silence/Stun/Snare. I don't have to much to say on team fighting as carry Lee Sin except go for their squishiest front line or if you see an opening dive the back line. For tanky Lee Sin my go to team fight strategy revolves around W'ing up to my front line and getting a double E and Randuins use on their back line. Then I decide if its worth staying to secure a kill or two, usually it is not and I will W back to my ADC and ult the person diving my ADC away and then just pressure them with extra damage/slow so my ADC can move up on their back line (that should be hanging around from your slows/disruption) once the immediate threats are taken care of.


6) Flashing over a wall to bait a flash then ward hopping back over it as a get away is some of the most fun I have had in this game.


7) Jungle minions are there as a get away, always remember to QQ to them and get aways become a breeze. More on the Q as a get away though. If you find 2 or more people hammer and anviling you in to go for a kill you're almost always better of Q'ing to the one with less damage output, slowing them and just running that way. Don't wait for them to converge on you.


8) Lee Sin has any number of gank paths. Running through lane, W'ing to a minion or ally champion and starting the gank works incredibly well. The amount of ground you can cover with a W, flash, QQ in the blink of an eye is crazy and with proper execution is free kills. Lee Sin also has amazing counter ganking. Lets say middle is getting ganked and the enemy mid and jungle have used most of their abilities trying to kill your mid and he is running away at 30%. Once you W to him and given him the shield and your full damage combo with your mids full damage combo will turn any gank around for a quick kill. Then you can usually follow up and get the double. Ganking as Lee Sin is nothing less but an art form. The amount of repositioning of yourself you can do and disruption on an enemy's movement whether through ult or slows you can do makes almost any situation a possible kill. You get in their face without having to use Q and they flash away? Thanks for the flash and the kill. Options options options. Can't stress it enough.


9) I can't think of much else right now, coffee still kicking in for the morning but I just want to stress so much how Lee Sin is a champion of options. There are multiple ways to go at every situation and there is usually a best option but there are usually second or third options that will at least be decent. Practice practice practice with him, his skill ceiling is unbelievably high. The more you run into a given situation the better your decision making in a similar/that situation will become.

EDIT: Random something I just thought of. Lee Sin is a champion of flow. Listening to music with a steady beat pattern and some kind of groove can help with the mentality of executing Lee Sin as the God of a champion he is. 

EDIT2: Post is going up some and getting good reception! Just got done playing 3 games this AM (all with Lee coincidentally) and have a few things I forgot. The spell vamp on his W is amazing. When finishing off the buff monsters You can just WW QSmiteQ and get a huge chunk of health back. Makes sustaining the jungle great. You can start camps with WW then do a full ability rotation with autos inbetween and the lifesteal/spellvamp buff will be up the whole time. It is imperative to utilize this part of his kit properly to stay healthy for the first 15 minutes of jungling so you can gankgankgankgank which is why you pick Lee Sin in the first place.

If you're running up to someone about to 1v1, and they know they are going to lead with a skill shot (Lux) just hover your mouse in a spot off to the side or on a minion ready to tap W first thing the animation starts to get the dodge and close the rest of the gap. I've dodged a few Tibbers and it is so satisfying! 

You will kick people away and they will live with less than an auto's worth of health. It happens to the best of us. A way to try to prevent this is if you're going for an execute you can QQ to them E then auto then ult and auto them again as they fly away if you cancel the end of your ult animation and right click them fast enough, definitely takes some practice though. Similar to auto-ing someone as they fly away from an Alistar W (RIP AP Alistar).

If you're in a situation where people are lined up you always want to ult the person closest to you so as they fly they knock up everyone you can. Don't want to misclick and ult the second or third person back and still ahve someone sitting in your face. Obvious one but easy to just want to ult the lowest person (everyone the person flying hits takes the same damage as the first person you kick).",Lee Sin,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1373562143.0,leesin,,True,t3_1i2t5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1i2t5b/lee_sin_main_with_some_tips/,

I know that you who played SNSS on EUW went; ""WTF, where is SNSS?"" a few months ago, I'm here to tell you why it disappeared and when it might return.

First thing first, the reason that SNSS on EUW disappeared was first that we didn't have enough players, we always lacked between 8-10 players to make a night being able to happen, second I was working on a ladder system for us to use, just so that those who want can keep track of their progress and we in Administration can see if someone is too good for Novice games or not good enough for Intermediate. The ladder system didn't work out as I wanted because I had a lot of things going on in my life, so it is currently on hold and might be brought in at a later date.

Now for the second part, I have just finished my work for the summer which means I will have a lot of spare time to organize this if something else doesn't come up. 

The thing is I do not have the crew necessary to be able to get this party started again. I've tweeted Rev and I'm still waiting for a reply, if he is up we have at least one streamer and caster, so if you are someone capable of either streaming or casting, please contact me. 

Also CG_BQ, Crusaderkitten, Tsoski and Rev if you read this, PM me, I want to talk to you.

You can use the special pings to make entries in chat logs instead.  The danger ping is great for this because you don't really need it for its intended purpose.  The normal yellow back ping is a better way of communicating danger anyway.


Go to keybindings and bind the danger ping to something that is easily accessible.  I use my mouse wheel. If you are in the middle of a fight and you see the enemy flash, use the danger ping.  This will make an entry in the chat log.  The next time you have a free moment, check the chat log for the ping and add the cooldown of flash to the timestamp to get the exact time the enemy flash will be up.

**Make It To Lategame**.

Lategame is a special, magical time in a round of League of Legends.  There's an upper limit on power in LoL, and you automatically start catching up as the enemy team approaches it.  Everybody is level 18, everybody has at least a couple of big items, and everybody has the potential to wreck any non-tanky champion who takes one step in the wrong direction.  Towers and inhibitors melt in seconds, and a hard sneeze is all it takes to clear a minion wave.  Every death matters.  With this much pushing potential, a 60-second death timer is an enormous momentum swing.  Even a 5v4 creates a big split push opportunity that can't be stopped.  A team can be 10-50 in kills, but landing one good AOE suddenly turns into a won teamfight and GG.

In short, **gold and kill counts matter so much less lategame**.  A single overextension, one bad teamfight, or a hole in your map vision is all it takes to lose a game in the 40-minute range.  You've probably seen dozens of tournament-caliber matches that are thrown by a single mistake in lategame - those are 2k+ professional players making those mistakes.  People at your Elo are DYING to make those mistakes!  Do you really think a 1k Elo player is going to stay with their team?  Do you really think they'll have ward coverage?  No, they'll be stupid and cocky and try to pick 1v1 fights because they're fed.  And that's when you jump on them with your whole team and go push to win.

Get insane ward coverage.  Every inch of your jungle should be lit up like a spotlight.  They have Oracle's?  Who cares?!  They'll go sweep wards in a small group and say ""HEY COME KILL THE TWO OF US WITH YOUR WHOLE TEAM WE'RE RIGHT HERE"" or they'll commit their whole team to sweeping your jungle and you'll send somebody to go split push and get out when they start chasing you.

The team that wins lategame is the team that doesn't make stupid mistakes, and everybody makes stupid mistakes.

**tl;dr Stall until lategame, stay as a group, pick somebody off or split push and go win.

Hey guys, I'm a Silver III player (Main is: Tienlong/NA) and I have been kicking this idea around my head for a few weeks now.  This will be mainly for people who are looking to coach their friends when they get started in the game.  This will not cover game strategy in detail, rather it is a set of guidelines for those of us who have friends just starting and are looking for an effective method to teach, coach, and mentor our new summoners.

If you like this method, great!  If not, even better!  What I am looking for is feedback from you, the community so that there is a solid method in improving the way we bring new players into the game we all love.  People play this game for different reasons, but it is people that make the game what it is.  My goal is to provide another way for new players to feel welcome to the community as well as a way for them to feel as if they are learning every time they play.

This guide is written with the assumption that the Master Summoner (Coach, Teacher, Mentor) has an advanced understanding of the game (or has watched plenty of LCS to know the proper vocabulary and strategic value of what is being said).  Unless requested, I will not go into detailed explanation on the talking points of this guide.  This is just a set of guidelines to help with teaching other players.  If you need help with the talking points of this guide, or if you simply just want to test my knowledge so you know I am not full of BS then feel free to message me on Tienlong/NA or PM me.

For those of you who are interested in my background (I really don't know why you would be, but for those of you that are): I am a US Army veteran of 7 years.  My military occupational specialty or MOS was 11B2O, for you non-Army types I was an Infantry Sergeant.  I have three long tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.  I have several rotations through the Joint-Readiness Training Center and the National Training Center, I have gone through the Army's: Warrior Leader Course, A US State Department Personal Security Officer course, Personal Security Officer training in Kuwait, I am also a Licensed Security Officer in Texas, and I have always been a Team Leader or Squad Leader in every assignment I have served on in my time in the Army.  I know how to train people and help experts improve.  But please!  Feel free to test my knowledge as it will help me stay sharp and/or get sharper.

**Summoner Academy Coaching Guide, by: Tienlong v1.0**
*****

###Teach, Coach, and Mentor###

##1.  The Basics: You should lightly touch on these subjects without going into too much detail unless specific questions are asked by your apprentice.
    *Champion Types and Team Positions/Roles
    *Summoner Spells
    *Basic Itemization for preferred role
    *Playing Standard: The Meta
    *Objectives: Buffs, Turrets, and Global Gold.
    *Three phases of the game: Early, Mid, and Late Game.
    *Sustains: Offer at least three points for the student to sustain in their game play.
    *Improves: Offer at least three points for the student to improve on. 

##2.  Play-Through: As your apprentice plays, make notes of their decisions and their cause and effect outcomes. If you have a way of recording in spectator mode, this will help you provide more detailed feedback.  Do not interrupt your apprentice during play, wait until the end of the game before speaking to them about their decisions.  The point is to allow the apprentice to make mistakes and seeing the outcome of those mistakes play through.
    *Champion Select: Team Composition
    *Game Start: Starting Items and Moving to Lane
    *Lane Phase: Farming and Stutter Stepping
    *Mid-Game: Itemization, Vision War, and Objective Control
        *Sixth-Man Push
        *Split Pushing
        *Initiating Team Fights
        *Team Fighting: Posturing, Positioning, and Clean Up
    *Late Game: Actionable Intel: Vision is the Key
        *Telegraphing Intent: The Double-Edged Sword
        *Team Fighting vs Back Dooring
    *Constants: Points that should persist through each phase.
        *Vision War: Warding and Counter Warding
        *Targets of Opportunity vs Priority Targeting
        *Reacting to: Junglers, Ally Mistakes, Opponent Mistakes, Your Mistakes, Tower Dives, Ganks, and Force Fights
        *Zone Control and Lane Pressure
        *Closing Out a Winning Game
        *Stalling for Victory in a Losing Game

##3.  The Post-Game After Action Report: This is when you talk to your apprentice about their decisions during the game.
	*Have a detailed list of talking points.  Include times, a description of events, and their outcomes.
	*All talking points must be relevant to the apprentice's actions, whether positive or negative.
	*Have the apprentice give at least three sustains and improves for their game-play.
	*Offer the apprentice at least three sustains and improves for their game-play.
	*Take a 10-20 minute break!
	*Rinse and Repeat from step 2.

*****
For those of you interested in a detailed explanation of any of my talking points, feel free to PM me or message me on Tienlong(NA Server) and I'll be happy to talk with you about it.  If you have advice, feedback, or if you want to tell me how noob I am for only being Silver III and offering up a coaching guide; still feel free to PM or message me.  I want to hear from all of you that are willing to give me your time.  But before you judge, just remember, Jimmy Johnson wasn't throwing passes to Michael Irving when the Cowboys won both Super Bowls against the Buffalo Bills.  Jack Entienne wasn't playing Mid-Lane and shot calling for TSM when they won the Spring Split Championship.  Just some food for thought and thanks for reading!

That's all.

The main issues I see at lower elo are the amount of deaths people stack up. I don't care how and why they have so many deaths, but every time you die, it is your fault only and it only leads closer to your defeat.

A death is a mistake. Games usually turn into major killfests or simply last too long because people get greedy for kills. It can turn  an easy, winnable game into a long forty minute to an hour base rush match simply because you decided to die on a kill streak for  your greed and offered the enemy a chance to comeback.

Secondly, people capitalize on deaths. Now, this may not be prominent in lower elo, but you will see, ESPECIALLY in tournaments how important a death is.  Remember games where it is late game and your AD or AP carry get caught out randomly and you lose the game? That's what it is precisely, people  higher elo know how to take towers, dragons, or even Baron off YOUR death. You will see that people don't die very often in high elo games because it is not about the kills at that point, it is about objectives. It ain't CoD or some shit.

With that being said, I've very rarely won games where I've died more than five times. For about five games in my match history, I can remember exactly how I died in each of those games, how I could have prevented it, and what kinds of mistakes I made.  League of Legends is a game that punishes mistakes. The team who makes the least mistakes win.

Think about the last deaths in your recent game. How you could have prevented them. The consequences it lead to.
And trust me, you'll be winning a ton more games.

Edit: I don't mean NEVER die, but think of it like this. Like I said before, a death is a mistake. You gave first blood as a top laner because you died to an enemy gank with no wards out. From this, you learn that 3 minutes is a vital time for every jungler (2nd camp clearing, looking for gank), and then next time, you play safer to prevent that death and mistake.

As an AD carry main, when I die, I think about why. If I got outplayed in lane, it's because I wasn't experienced enough. In teamfights, I wasn't wary enough of my positioning. Of course, deaths that result in 1-3 trades are always great, but most of the time, a death means netting the enemy team 300 to 500 g closer to their next item.

As a support, dying for your team is completely fine. I'm not saying every death is a bad thing, but that people shouldn't just pass on them. Think about what happened in that circumstance and learn from it.

Let's just say for the sake of example that I am playing Vayne and I have a Doran's Blade and a Zeal. I return to base with 1650g enough gold to finish Phantom Dance or purchase a BF Sword.  
  
I understand it is completely dependent on what champion I am playing and what item I would be able to complete. There are just a lot of times I feel conflicted with my purchases especially in a tough game. Whereas I don't know how long it is going to be before I will be able to make a 1550g purchase for a BF sword.

The flowchart above came about through a query I posted to experienced tops and junglers about whether to peel or dive in teamfights. (can read the original thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fs52m/advice_on_peeling_help_needed_from_experienced/ )

For those unsure about the terms, '**peeling**' means staying back with your squishies and helping them survive enemy assassins/bruisers through your CC and damage. '**Diving**' means going after enemy carries.

In lower divisions, peeling tends to be neglected and as a result teams lose a lot of their teamfight potential - because their adc very often gets instagibbed by the enemy. By peeling more, assuming your adc is half decent you can win a lot more teamfights. The problem is less experienced players just pick a target and dive, dive, dive, even when this is not the best idea.

* Your thoughts on challenges (be as detailed as needed to get your idea across), try to stick to the below format. Please make sure that your challenges still promote good gameplay and teamwork.

My best role is AD Carry but I've noticed a lot lately, especially in solo queue, that players don't often protect their carries.  I can't count the number of games where I've been bullied out of team fights as the result of an enemy bruiser charging completely past my entire team.  If one stun or CC had hit that champion I could have continued to do damage and helped my team win the fight!  Instead, I was forced to retreat and couldn't dish out the damage that I wanted to do.

**Mechanical:** Mechanical skills are things like last hitting, landing or avoiding skill-shots, being able to consistently flash over walls without failing (from maximum distance), animation-canceling, reaction times, anything like that.


**Theory:** Theory skills are knowing the cooldowns on enemy and ally abilities, knowing when you can kill dragon/baron reasonably safely, knowing if you can survive an enemy mage's burst, knowing what items to buy in each situation, knowing the best ward spots, and when to use them, knowing when you need to go back, ect. Theoretically, theory skills could be replaced by someone next to you or on Skype telling you what to do.

**Social:** Social skills are the most under-estimated in League, but are probably equally important to the first two sets. League is a team game and your team is made of people with emotions and reactions to anything that happens. Social skills are about shaping those reactions, and your own, to try and ensure teamwork and good attitude. ""Avoiding trolls"" as it were. Social skills include: taking the blame, even when it isn't your fault. Being flexible in champion picks so your team can play to their strengths. Ending arguments. Not reacting badly and trolling. Not taunting, insulting, or blaming your team and offering advice without being condescending.

While some players with exceptional skill in the first two categories can get to a high Elo (hence 'high Elo trolls'), most of us will find it much easier to rise by working on all three of these categories.

When I'm counterjungled and receive no help it's also very frustrating that all of a sudden you're a noob for not ganking, then after a while I get fed up and go gank (being a couple levels down due to being counter jungled) and die then all of a sudden I'm the scum of the earth and the reason we lost.

Sorry for ranting, but the moral of the story is to please have map awareness and respond quickly when your jungler is being counter jungled because not only will it help him, but it will help you by possibly getting a kill and shut down their jungler.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1kcysb,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1kcysb/i_think_ive_found_out_why_counter_jungling_is_so/,
1375029748.0,50,self.summonerschool,1j7zk1,A player (Silver 3) asked me to spectate a game of his. Here's a write up I did with some advice/tips.,ItsNomnomz,61,11,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1j7zk1/a_player_silver_3_asked_me_to_spectate_a_game_of/,"**In General:**

**Get the right runes**

A typical ad carry rune page looks like this:

* Attack Damage Marks 9x
* Armor Seals 9x
* Magic Resistance Glyphs 9x
* Life Steal Quintessences 3x

**AD carry masteries:**

* 21/XX/XX

Taking the left side of the offense tree and putting the remaining 9 points in utility or defensive, depending on your play style and what hero you are playing.

**CSing/last hitting:**

* People in Silver can't CS well, therefore you can almost win any lane by just farming well. The ideal amount is to have 10 minions for every minute on the game clock (20 mins = 200 CS) These high numbers not very reachable for lower elo players, so try to get about 75% of that.

* If you get pushed to your tower, you will most likely lose a lot of CS, try to push the lane back a bit using whatever skills your AD has so the minions stay nicely in the middle.

* You can practice CSing in a custom game. Just take normal runes and masteries, go bot lane, and try to hit 90+ cs at 10 minutes.

* Taking 2 points into Butcher (+4 damage to minions and monsters) instead of 2 points into attack speed can also greatly help you with CSing.

**Orb walking, stutter stepping, attack moving w/e you want to call it:**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgMMxTofZ5A (Check out Ciderhelm's channel, there's lots of cool stuff for new players on it)

This video explains it pretty well. I'd like to add to that, that both A+Left Click and Shift+Right Click work by default.

A good way to practice this, is to go into a custom game and try kiting the double golems in the jungle.

**Some tips for playing Caitlyn in specific:**

In the game I specced he played Caitlyn, so here's some advice on Caitlyn.

Her Q (Piltover Peacemaker) can be used to shove waves quickly. If you have good warding you should be using this to shove your opponent against the tower, making them lose cs. When using it to harass, you should use it when your opponent is moving up to make a last hit in a creep. They'll be stuck in the attack animation and wont be able to dodge it most of the time. (This goes for all skill shots by the way)

* Her W (Yordle Snap Trap) reveals fog of war for a brief moment, use this to your advance so you don't have to face check bushes.

* Regarding placing traps, try to keep them in lane, not random places in the river. The best places to put some are in the lane bushes, or next to the opponents tower if you're pushing them to it. This works especially well against short range AD carries.

* Her E (.90 Caliber Net) Is generally used as an escape, but can also be used to gap close by shooting it the other way.

* When lining up E&gt;Q quickly you can do the popular combo. The net leaves the opponent slowed making is hard to dodge the coming Q, as well as instantly putting yourself out of harm's way.

* Her R (Ace in the Hole) Can be used to harrass and finish.There's not really much special to this skill.
When lined up with E &gt; Q combo it is possible to do huge burst damage.Because of the .50 cal net slow it's also hardy for opponents to block the shot.

* Caitlyn is one of the only AD carries with good AD ratio's on her skills. There for Bloodthirster or Infinity Edge are way better as a first item than Blade of the Ruined King for her.

* Auto attacking opponents when they go in for CS is extremely important, especially when you have a headshot proc ready.

1371776281.0,49,self.summonerschool,1grkd2,Five traits that every League player has and how to broaden your learing horizon,Chenille7,68,19,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1grkd2/five_traits_that_every_league_player_has_and_how/,"Hello. I am a gold 5 division player in League of Legends but that does not mean that I am good at the game in any way, shape or form. Being without a computer for the last few months and having no nearby friends who play League, I have spent what time where I would normally be playing solo queue instead watching the streams of players who actually know what they are doing. During this time, I found that these players have a wide variety of skills which they could call upon in order to win their games. When I would watch low elo replays, I then noticed that those players also had the same variety of skills that the high elo players did, but they would only focus specifically on one thing and when that failed, they did not know what to do.

There are many great guides written on how to become a better player, most of them being guides on gameplay, roles, and champions. The problem that many players who want to get better have is that there is no organized chart for them to follow. You can improve and focus on just one aspect of your gameplay but if you end up in a situation where you can’t apply that skill, then you’ll have nothing going for you and all that work you put into yourself will be for naught. Frustrating, huh?

That being said, here are the five attributes that every League of Legends player has, whether it’s your first time playing the game or you are a seasonsed veteran in the LCS. You should be able to pick one of these attributes as something that you are good at, something that “speaks” to you. Everyone who plays League has at least one skill that makes them stand out from their peers.

1)	Mechanics: You rarely misclick and can attack move with the best of them. Your knowledge of positioning makes you hard to catch and pin down. Ability combos come to you like breathing.
Pro Examples: Doublelift, Wildturtle

2)	Knowledge: If you don’t know something about the meta, it hasn’t been done yet. Theorycrafting is half the fun for you. You possess knowledge of a wide variety of matchups.
Pro Examples: Scarra, WingsofDeathx, Voyboy

3)	Awareness: You have a sixth sense of where people are, even if you can’t see them. You know when to go for objectives. You are always at the right place at the right time.
Pro Examples: Dyrus, Trick2g 

4)	Charisma: You can make the most toxic player tolerable for a time. People listen to you when you make calls. You can be the glue that holds the team together. 
Pro Examples: Reginald, Saintvicious

5)	Drive: You are your own harshest critic. Failure is not a word in your vocabulary. You can steady yourself if you’re on tilt.
Pro Examples: Anyone who has ever put serious effort into improving their game. That means you.

The secret to becoming a better player is knowing what you are already good at and then using your strengths as a starting point in branching out to all the other aspects one must master to become good at League of Legends.  For example, if you have good mechanics but aren’t winning games, maybe you aren’t in fights where your team needs you (awareness) or your team doesn’t realize that they need to protect you since you can carry (charisma). And if you don’t think that there is anything wrong with your gameplay though you are losing consistently, maybe that means that it’s time to look inward (drive).

Now the chart itself does have a glaring weakness of not taking into effect various levels of each of these aspects. For example, there are different levels of each aspect. It is very true that someone could carry their way to Challenger with just one of these qualities. While I wish to address this in future articles if the community views them to be positive, this guide is written to help others broaden their gameplay and gain a new insight into the many depths of League. Please leave any questions and comments below and I will get back to you. 

Disclaimer: I am bad at League of Legends. The pro examples were selected based on them being well-known by a wide audience, not out of any personal bias.

So I pick Udyr for jungle and prepare for the match. Last pick is our top pick and he locks Volibear. Im ok with it but then he takes smite. He then says, "" I wanna play volibear I changed my mind and I am going to jungle."" At this point its no use arguing so I switch my spells and masteries for top lane Udyr something I have rarely done. I am going against a pantheon which I am not too happy about but I am not too worried either. 

So too fastforward a bit to my point I ended up getting completely shut down in lane. I maxed turtle for defense but Panth's spears were still just too devestating. I think here is where a lot of lower elo players and newer players start to get antsy. They think that their sole purpose in lane is to dominate and win their lane. I was able to switch mindsets. I knew I was not going to be able to beath pantheon and on top of that I wasn't going to get much farm. So on my first back I get a GP5 and start to build tanky for late game. Jungler ganks me once I get a kill but he sees my lane is stable so he is able to camp other lanes. Fast forward to late game I still havent died and Panth has 40+ CS on me but only 2 kills from the few roaming adventures he had been on an my GP5 kept me close in farm. But because our jungler was able to camp mid and get mid and himself fed we were ahead on gold and kills going into late game. Tank Udyr is very strong late game and synergized well with our team and we ended up being able to poke them down to nothing and win within 30 minutes. In a lane I was completely out manuevered and out classed in I was able to not die and hardly lose out on any CS and ended up 2/0/6. So my point is you can win by not feeding. Know when you're going to get beat up in lane deviate from your build, get yourself gold and turtle if youre playing against someone who can dive. 

TL;DR - Didn't get to pick my lane ended up countered and outplayed. Didn't feed any kills. Patience and smart play led to no deaths and a fed mid and fairly powerful late game presence.

1360015263.0,49,self.summonerschool,17w3w2,General tips of solo queue.,Litejason,53,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/17w3w2/general_tips_of_solo_queue/,"Small bit of background. [Info about me](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/24536169#profile). [Here's proof of my summoner!](http://imgur.com/32AcLON)

With that said, here's a short general guide on solo queue!

1. Remember that this is only a game, even if it does take up 100% of your free time. The game will not be of much relevance to your future life unless you decide to become a pro gamer or work in a gaming related industry. This means your emotional attachments to League should not be so strong, so that you do not rage when you lose a game or die stupidly. Remaining emotionally/physically calm is very important. If you have issues regarding emotional/physical control, then find a way to relax first, then play League.

2. Solo queue is a ladder designed for competitive people in a fairly competitive setting. If you are a casual gamer and do not like the occasional flamer then ranked will not be for you. But do give ranked a go if you feel you will have a fun experience in the ladders.

3. Do not worry about your ranking. I used to do this pre-S3 ranking system where 'ladder anxiety' kicked in, preventing me from playing ranked for a long time. Just play to win and the rankings will come to you naturally.

4. Take each game as an individual game (even the promotion games). If you put yourself in that pressure of 'I gotta win every game to be good', you're putting yourself in even more pressure to do well. In league you want to relax and play your best as each game comes.

5. Make yourself comfortable before you click 'match me with team mates'. This includes a bit of self comforting; breathing calmly, sitting comfortably with keyboard/mouse in a comfortable position is vital to making sure you do well in solo queue. Minimize discomfort is the key here.

6. Be open in what roles you play. I usually get the champion select chat going saying ""prefer ad/top/mid"". This will encourage others to call upon their preferred lanes and it will help to provide some knowledge of your allies before the game starts. If your preferred role gets taken, don't panic. Choose another role you are comfortable playing and also strive to help others choose their champions during champ select.

7. Use the loading screen to your advantage. Many people just stare at the loading screen borders and scoff at each others borders. You should be using the time effectively instead, studying the enemies champion picks and run through scenarios in your head already. During this time you can also get yourself comfortable(bathroom break, get a drink of water).

8. When the game starts, get yourself out of the nexus as fast as possible. This is **really** underrated. You look at the professional gamers in League and they're out of the nexus by the time the camera pans towards their location. Getting yourself out of the nexus gives you vital seconds over the opponents. Positioning and map vision is what usually you gain when you do this.

9. Help your jungler at all times. It's not the junglers job to baby sit your lane, but it is your job to ensure your team mates are within reach of help. This may seem hard at low elo but the simple thing you need to know about this is just to respond to pings on the map. If your jungler is attacked and you are fairly close, get to the jungler if it looks like he will survive. Heck, you may even turn it around and get a kill or two from your efforts.

9. Focus on CSing. Generally you want to be aiming for 80-90cs at 10minutes across all lanes. This is not always possible but you want to be aiming for that. A solid 80-90cs compared to 50-60cs is a 500golds difference, enough for you to afford a doran's blade/ring. This will give you significant power over your lane enemy. 

10. Work with your jungler. This usually involves you keeping your eye out for your jungler, letting him know that you are there to help when he needs it. Most of times this will happen when you are skirmishing the enemy jungle and your jungler requests help. Follow him and assure them they are safe.

11. Make use of the pings. This is extremely important in solo queue because of no voice communication. Pings are what give your team information about the map and what you're doing. Ping when you want help, ping when you tell your team to fight, ping a turret when you want to push it down, ping back if you think the situation is dangerous. There is always a situation to use the pings simply because of the control you get over your team using pings. Don't spam it though, obviously.

12. Learn to damage trade. This is supposed to be a short general guide, so I won't write too much about this. Know how much damage you will deal, and how much the enemy will deal to you should they fight back. Generally this does not mean hovering over your skills and seeing how much damage you deal, but dealing 1 spell at a time to the enemy and 'testing the waters'. If they take the damage and do not retaliate then try to play more aggressive, forcing more lane dominance onto the opponent. If you're going even in trades, then focus on CSing as well as countering their damage. If you're losing trades then you'll need to base for more health pots, going sustain items or calling your jungler for help. You want to always make sure you can stay in lane whilst taking some punishment, don't be reckless and burn all of your sustain in a couple of trades, be sustaining and this will help you stay in the lane for longer.

13. Team fight accordingly to these rules:
 * Am I in a good position to deal damage and be safe? If yes, signal your team to engage and maintain good positioning throughout the fight, focusing on dealing damage to your nearest targets(yes aim for tanks if you cannot hit anyone else). But aim for the enemy carries if you can reach them and they are cc'ed.
 * How likely are either teams able to dish out their damage? If you're against an AoE heavy composition then you should be more careful of your positioning and engage. Generally if you can survive the burst of an AoE comp then you will win the rest of the fight. Avoid the AoE damage and kite/peel for your allies.
 * Am I chasing or the one being chased? If you're the one being chased then you should not run back to your turret, but run to your nearest ally for help. If you're an AD carry and you're being chased by a vicious Olaf seek aid in the form of your top laner, support or AP carry. Your allies will not neglect the AD carry unless your positioning is terrible and there is no point in saving you. If you're the one chasing then ensure your team can follow you up, such as a flash dazzle on Taric; Amumu flash ult into the enemy team. Going 1v5 is no good so always be aware of the position of your team mates (The best way to get people on the same page is to ping to signal to fight).
 * Whose left in the fight. This is very important, if the enemy AD carry gets blown up and your top laner gets taken out then the fight should still be carried on. AD carries deal more damage than the top lane so you have more damage potential, use the damage potential to continue the fight in your favor so that you win the engage. If your laners are dead then the fight is lost and you're now on 'damage limitation mode'. Run as far as you can away from the enemies and hope that they do not kill anymore of your team members.

14. Gold! Use it! There is no use in 2k sitting in your pockets being stowed away for nothing. Gold is the single most advantageous stat in the game, and if you have a gold lead over your enemies, abuse it for better items and force more team fights. Gold will usually carry you through the game in items. Without items you cannot deal damage, cannot take damage, so make the best use of the gold earned by your hard work CSing and getting kills. Even buying 1 pot for the lane may make a huge difference. A good example of this is WingsofDeathx. He always buys around 4-6 pots when he goes back to the nexus because of the instant sustain it provides. Dyrus also tends to spam pots a lot too.

15. Push turrets for map positioning. The Korean's love the turret pushing aggression, because it gives the team even more gold and further map advantage. As an AD carry if your first turret is down it significantly increases your risk of dying to ganks from the jungle or being zoned by the enemy laners. Be aggressive but also maintain good turret health. 

16. **Buy wards.** This should be much earlier through the post but it really is a simple job. As a support warding is easy, you do it because you want the enemies position to help you win the game. Ward everything. Many streams will give you advice on general warding so watch them for some advice.

17. Don't mess around doing nothing, end the game when you can. Everybody often gets the game where they are on the enemy nexus but throw the ball right back into the enemies hand. You're playing a ranked game and you want to win, so hit the enemy nexus. Don't delay time because you think you've won the game, focus the enemy nexus like Yellowpete does and remain calm when you're in the enemies nexus. With homeguard boots currently this is very important. You never know when the enemy could just jump from nowhere and kill you. Therefore, you just want to end the game as soon as you can.

Those are just some general tips. I know I have missed out many things out however many other things in League cannot be explained in words, so just play as many games as you can and never rage.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1360015674.0,,,True,t3_17w3w2,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/17w3w2/general_tips_of_solo_queue/,

Map: Summoner's Rift

---------------

Rule#1: get the same champion bot (except annie or brand or whatever bot that is not retarded) on each side and each team tries to protect the bot. 

---------------

The side that has the most bot deaths loses. Nexuses destruction doesn't matter decide the winner of the game, but it does end the game. 

---------------

Rule#2: Upon the spawn you would have to follow the bot and stick with it till the first bot death has been spilled. The point of putting 2 same champion bots is that they will both chose the same starting lane. 

---------------

Under the condition that 2 bots will have the same amount of deaths then we take a look at the assists and kills. kill has 2 points and assists has 1. 

---------------

Rule#3: Surrender is not allowed. If a team surrenders it would be considered as a straight away lose even though their bot may have had less deaths.

FAQ:

* 1. Why are we not allowed to start the game as if it was a normal summoner's rift's game?

The answer to that is because for new people who don't realize is that the point isn't to have a better advantage over an enemy team and objectives have no influence on the game mode (even though that would give you an ability to kill enemy bot easier and break through front line).

* 2. Why not combine deaths, assist and kill together and make it a point system?

In that condition some more experienced players may have an upper hand by killing an enemy summoner's champion and giving nonstop assist to a bot.

* 3. Why summoner's rift?

Summoner's rift is a huge map. This way you will have to think if you should protect the fellow bot or go to another lane to kill an enemy bot? Becomes a bit more interesting than just a chaotic fight (ARAM)/running from one side of map to another in matter of seconds (twisted). 

* 4. Why should I play this?

A lot of fun especially if you are with your friends and you just yell at the bot thinking that it would hear you.

**EDIT:** * 5. What can I learn from this?

**There are a lot of things you can learn from this:**

* a. Team coordination and communication.

* b. When is it good to roam around the map and push other lanes.

* c. Which champions are item based and which are level based.

* d. What champions work together in team fights. 

* e. You will have to think that you have to end the game at a certain moment. Timing is a key to that. 

U learn all that playing in the game and you can put theory into practice.

I think her kit is amazing, even though zyra outshines her in some cases, because her ult is a knockup and not a stun (tenacity) and her root is multi-target. However, Morgana has a 3s snare at level 5 (if you max that first), makes champions like nautilus basically ultless, I just see so many positive points in her kit, with little negatives. She negates most hard engages, at least from high priority targets.
Her ult, if used as a support, leads to amazing peel for the carries. It deals considerable damage, slows for 3 seconds and stuns for 1.5. 
You can use her Dark Bind to either make plays into high priority targets or use it to peel; chaining a bind after your ult landed on the frontline is simple and with the new CC visuals you can chain it perfectly. Her E makes it easy to escape most ganks as well.

We get a lot of people posting streams either looking to help others or looking for help. Unfortunately, many of them are merely seeking easy viewers off /r/summonerschool; these individuals have ruined the integrity of streams for other, genuine streamers, thus people rarely check stream posts because there's a high chance the stream won't be helpful at all.

From today forward, **no stream posts are allowed.** Instead, here's what we will be doing:

* The mods will launch a site similar to [this one](http://liveleaguestream.com/) of approved /r/summonerschool streamers and high quality streams we feel are helpful to the community. Each stream will have a stream description so you know what you're getting into.

* The mods will scan streams themselves to check for quality. This process will take a while, depending on how frequently the streamer streams.

* There will be a section on the site for streamers who are looking for help. Anyone can submit their stream to this section and it will also display whether or not it is live.

For now, we will start preapproving streams for site launch. Please send me or all the mods your stream link and what time you will be streaming - I recommend giving us at least an hour in advance.

In addition, since we don't really have a solid date of the site launch, there will probably be a post of approved streamers later when we get a good streamer base going. As for people looking for help, I recommend y'all check out the Personal Training section of our sidebar.

1368960380.0,47,self.summonerschool,1emixv,The lack of personal responsibility really grates on my nerves.,JakalDX,55,8,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1emixv/the_lack_of_personal_responsibility_really_grates/,"So something I've been wondering about the League community:

The more I play this game, the more I see that nothing that happens is anybody's fault. Of course this is hyperbole, but there is a huge amount of excuses thrown around endlessly.

The one that makes me cringe the most is the dreaded ""X is OP"", whether or not its true.

So many times I have heard from allies and enemies ""Yeah of course you won, Zac/Darius/Tristana/Ryze/Nautilus/what have you is OP"". Not the fact that they tried to trade AAs with Darius, or they failed to ward for Naut, or they let Ryze farm uninhibited. It's the fact that the champ is just too good. 

What I am wondering is, is this attitude just in the lower ranks? Or do people talk like this in Plat/Diamond too?

Now I come from the fighting game community. The idea of tier lists are not unheard of. Thing is, only the scrubbiest players whine about Zangief being too good, or someone spamming hadouken. They do what they can to mitigate a characters strengths and take advantage of their weaknesses. They recognize that the game is the game and work within the rules. Saying ""You only beat me because you're Zangief"" is just pathetic.

I'm sorry to rant, I've just had several games ina  row in which a player doing well was told they were just using a cheap character.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,default,True,t3_1emixv,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1emixv/the_lack_of_personal_responsibility_really_grates/,

However, among the random wish-wash of teams, I've found consistent factors in a winning team-comp.

- There is always a short lvl 1 fight in the middle to contest control of both relics. For that reason, the best champions typically are strong at lvl 1.

- starting gold is equal to boots 1 + 475. Always buy boots + dorans because of the level one fight, even if you're jungler, b/c you'll be porting back on low hp anyways. You can buy pots with the money you've earned once you've recalled.

- The winning team typically has an ADC because the gold income level is higher, exp rates are lower, and early game tends to drag out due to tower placement. In addition, fighting space tends to be cramped, so an ADC's reach gives them extra ability to contribute damage.

- Since there are fewer members of the team to peel/protect, that ADC typically has an escape, meaning the holy trinity + tristana is much more viable than usual, also because they have such good early-game burst potential.

- The secondary member of the team fills the role of bruiser/peeler, tanking the damage and keeping the ADC safe.

- The tertiary member can be anything, although typically its a second bruiser, mage, or assassin.

- From the habits of old TT, most players don't run a jungler. Running a jungler typically sets up a 2v1 lane. However, since there are no wards, not running a jungler means no mid-map awareness/control, leaving your team vulnerable to altar theft and cross-lane ganks.

- AOE damage tends to be lackluster b/c of less overall potential targets, while single-target bursts and sustained damage are more powerful due to the higher impact of shutting down and removing a single player from a team.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_12g4zj,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/12g4zj/my_findings_after_playing_a_few_rounds_of_twisted/,

* **Leona**

Leona is traditionally a support/tank. In the meta, Leona is expected to go to botlane and use her decent early damage (a lot of which is from her passive) to secure kills. Leona can work in lane with a bruiser like Jarvan, or an AD carry like Graves. Leona is usually built with a Philosopher's Stone &amp;/or a Heart of Gold since she'll usually let her partner take minions and wants some gold income, then builds tanky items like an Aegis of the Legion, Mercury Treads, Shurellia's Revierie, Frozen Heart, or Bashee's Veil. If you feel you're tanky enough at a point with Leona and want more damage, Trinity Force is a possibility, but very expensive.  
*Alternative builds*: Some people might try AP or (tanky)DPS Leona, but her AP ratios and base attacking stats are low, so this isn't recommended. If you have a team that will help you clear the jungle, Leona's ganks are potent enough that jungling is definitely possible. Solo lane Leona isn't advised because she is a poor farmer and can't use her passive in fights without someone else around.

* **Malphite**

Malphite is usually played as a tank in either top lane or in the jungle. Malphite's main strength is his ultimate which is a long-distance, decent-duration AoE knockup that has great base-damage, and his ability to significantly slow attack speed. As a tank, Malphite often gets a Philosopher's Stone &amp;/or Heart of Gold, before building tanky items such as a Warmogs Armor, Force of Nature, or Randuin's Omen. A common mistake by new Malphite players is to build too much armor. Malphite's W gives him bonus % armor and his E does a tiny bit more damage based off of your armor, but neither of these are major enough to neglect health and magic resist - both super important for tanking.  
*Alternative builds*:  Malphite is very playable as a mage in midlane. His passive allows him to trade with most characters if you avoid them long enough to let it recharge, and his Q (and all other skills) has a high base damage for winning trades and harassing. As a mage, you usually don't want to level his W until level 13 to give you more burst, and more control over when you push your lane. Standard items include 2 Doran's Rings, Sorcerer's Shoes, Abyssal Sceptre, Glacial Shroud, and Deathfire Grasp. Deathfire Grasp becomes a major part of his damage output and you must remember to activate it. 

* **Vladimir**

Vladimir is usually played as a mage in top or midlane. He is strong in lane because of his combination of being manaless and having a self heal, and in teamfights because his ultimate amplifies his entire team's damage. Don't be fooled by his passive - it can give a pretty nice amount of HP with your AP, but the AP it gives for building HP is quite small and not nearly worth focusing on. It's also easy to be fooled by his W. It can deal damage and heal you for a portion of that, but it hurts you to activate and doesn't do great damage. It's almost always better to use as an escape mechanism. Usual items include Hextech Revolver(eventually Will of the Ancients), Crystal Scepter, and Deathcap. A lot of players have recently been using Deathfire Grasp too.  
*Alternative builds*: I suppose tank or jungle Vladimir might be vaguely possible, but I'd very much recommend avoiding either.

* **Annie**

Annie is usually played as a mage in midlane. Annie has strong base damages, the possibility to stun in an AoE, and can be quite durable. Annie's Q is good for last hitting, and charging up her stun by doing so. If you've harassed your enemy down, Annie has a lot of potential to kill someone with her combo at level 6. Against a single target, use your Q to stun before casting other spells. It has the shortest cooldown, so you have a chance to cast it again, and it cannot miss so you don't risk wasting a stun charge or an entire ult. In teamfights, try and stun multiple people with your W or ult. Annie can be built pretty much anywhere on the scale from a glass cannon mage to a tank, due to her CC and base damages, but a middleground is usually best. Good items for Annie can include a Rod of Ages(if you don't expect to be given blue buff), a Crystal Scepter, a Deathcap, an Abyssal Scepter, and a Zhonya's Hourglass. Lots of other items such as Frozen Heart, Void Staff, Deathfire Grasp, or Banshee's Veil, are also an option on Annie.  
*Alternate builds*: After her most recent buff, I imagine Annie is able to jungle if you have a rune page of tier 3 armor yellows, tier 3 flat ability power blues, and tier 3 ability power quints. Test it out with a friend in a custom game first, but I imagine this could be very fun and pretty viable if done right.

* **Olaf**

Olaf is playable as either a toplaner or a jungler. Olaf can be a major bully in toplane due to his spammable true damage and good sustain with his W, can bait well because his passive gives insane attack speed at low HP, and his ultimate which ignores all cc makes it easy to focus a target in a teamfight. In lane, Olaf will usually want to max his true damage and apply it to an opponent whenever possible after level 3/5(depending on the enemy champion). Very effective against melee champions. In the jungle, Olaf can have quite decent ganks with the burst from his Q and E, and has an ok cleartime. Probably best in top lane. He is usually built as a tanky damage dealer with items like Warmogs Armor, Frozen Mallet, Atma's Impaler, Maw of Malmortus, Yomuu's Ghostblade, Frozen Heart, Randuin's Omen, Force of Nature, or Wriggle's Lantern.  
*Alternative builds*: I have heard of people trying spellvamp Olaf to heal off of his E, but this is probably a really bad idea in most games. Some people also build Olaf for pure damage, which is very effective in smaller skirmishes, but loses a lot of his ability to dive into the middle of the enemy team.

* **Warwick**

A lot of new players are encouraged to play Warwick as a jungler because he keeps himself alive very well, however jungle Warwick has almost no impact on the game before level 6 and doesn't clear the jungle awfully quickly, so isn't always the best choice, especially since in early levels you might be leaving someone 1v2 toplane where you can't do much to help them early on. He is, however, very effective in a solo lane. His weakness in lane is that he can't kill minions quickly if the enemy wants to push the lane, but he sustains himself very well with his passive and Q, and his ult is a very powerful skill that scales well into lategame. He usually builds tanky items, such as a Spirit Visage, Frozen Heart, Mercury Treads, Randuin's Omen, Frozen Mallet, or Banshee's Veil. If you have mana problems in lane, a Doran's Ring or two is not uncommon, and if you want damage, a Wits End is a good choice.  
*Alternative builds*: Some players build Warwick more damage-centric, with items such as a Bloodthirster, Phantom Dancer, Madred's Bloodrazor, or Beserker's Greaves. This can make Warwick very strong in a 1v1 situation, but he is already naturally powerful in these situations and this sort of build can destroy his ability to initiate against the enemy team, and makes him very weak to burst. AP and on-hit builds suffer the same fate.

* **Caitlyn**

Caitlyn is almost exclusively played on botlane as a ranged AD carry. Caitlyn has some strong early game damage with her skills, and has the best base range in the game to allow her easy harassment, but like all ranged AD carries, her main focus in the early game should be last hitting minions to prepare for lategame. Lategame, Caitlyn should use her range and net(dash/slow) to position herself safely while outputting as much damage as possible. Remember that her ult has a significant charge-up time, so don't use it on anyone you could just attack. Her standard build is something like Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer, Bloodthirster, Phantom Dancer, Quicksilver Sash/Guardian Angel.  
*Alternative builds*: Because of her good range and powerful poke skill early game, Caitlyn can manage midlane against some opponents if you have an AP somewhere else on your team.

* **Kayle**

YAY KAYLE~! Kayle is currently my most played character, and is very powerful. Kayle is able to fill any role in the game quite well. Kayle is usually advertised as a hybrid, but her AP Ratios are quite poor, making this usually a sub-optimal build. I find she's usually best played as a straight AD carry, but an on-hit build or tanky-AD build can work as well, and a more aura-focused build is probably best if you find yourself playing support(probably her worst role, but not terrible.) Kayle has a very powerful early game indeed, max Q first unless you're being heavily out-harassed and just need to survive (max W), or are against someone like Sion who just pushes the lane and walks off somewhere else (max E for farming). Take E at level 1, and harass often, your basic attacks with E active will hit harder than most characters at level 1. By level 2, you should take every opportunity to hit your opponent with Q and follow up with repeated hits with E. Because of Q's slow, you should be able to avoid taking any hits from most melee champions, and should be able to hit ranged champions multiple times when they're running away easily. When using W, be careful of the mana cost, it's not massive, but neither is the heal and the cost adds up if you're spamming your spells. Other than being a lane bully, be sure to last hit since you have a strong lategame. In the jungle, Kayle's ganks are pretty good because she has a slow, can start attacking before being in melee, and can apply red buff from a range. Her E is also very good for clearing minion camps (and should be maxed first when jungling). Good items on Kayle include Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer, Bloodthirster, Black Cleaver, Last Whisper and Phantom Dancer, although you should build according to the situation. Wriggle's Lantern is recommended for jungling.  
*Alternative builds*: On-hit Kayle (Wits End, Malady, Ionic Spark, Madred's Bloodrazor) can work, but generally does less damage than building straight AD in the lategame. If you need magic damage, though, it should work fine. A support with Zeke's, Aegis, Shurellia's, Banshe's Veil and Black Cleaver should be useful for helping the team while doing alright damage and amplifying your team's damage. AP Kayle with a Deathfire Grasp, Deathcap, and Lichbane, can work, but I don't see a reason to pick her other other APs with her mediocre AP scaling.

* **Talon**

Talon is a physical damage assassin usually played in midlane. His strength is that, with his silence and burst at level 6+, he can often kill squishier mages and take down important targets throughout the game due to his stealth and blink. In midlane, Talon will usually max Rake first and harass his opponent a bit while CSing. After level 6, you should judge when you can kill an opponent and try to get the kill when you judge they're low enough HP. If the enemy is out of lane or you've pushed them to their turret and they can't push the wave quickly (like Ryze or Fiddlesticks), then you can take the chance to go and gank another lane, which he is very good at.  
*Alternative builds*: Talon can possibly go to the jungle or toplane, but he isn't very quick or sustained in the jungle, and toplane makes it harder to roam to botlane and the opponents in toplane are usually tanky enough that you can't burst them. I'd recommend sticking to midlane.

* **Twisted Fate**

Twisted Fate is mostly played as a mage in midlane. He gives a hard to notice, but reasonably powerful gold boost to his entire team (which can easily be over 2000 gold overall by endgame). He can poke enemies down hard with his Wild Cards, and has a stun on a very short cooldown with Pick a Card (but it's also possible to make a mistake and end up just regening your mana with it too). After level 6, he can have very powerful ganks by 'locking in' a gold card BEFORE you use your ultimate, then teleporting to a lane, stunning an opponent and following up with your Wild Cards. If you coordinate this with your jungler, it is very likely to net kills almost every time and allows you to win multiple lanes for your team. Usual items include Deathcap, Lichbane, Void Staff, and a Banshee's Veil or Quicksilver Sash.  
*Alternative builds*: TF is quite often build as an AD carry, however his low range and survivability makes him very easy to be focused down and blown up, and his attack speed booster isn't very powerful. He provides a more often stun than any other AD, but his weaknesses make this a dangerous choice in most situations. Other players build TF with on-hit items like Wits End and Ionic Spark, this plays very similarly to AD TF, but doing magical damage and usually being a bit more durable, but generally has the same weaknesses and is not recommended. I have heard of more success than failure with jungle TF and tank TF, but if you lose while playing that, your team will probably blame you. Experiment with them at your own risk.

(if any screenshots are required for assistance, please look through the album located starting at http://imgur.com/a/rO3Ub#0 for any help.  if you're still having trouble, ping me on Reddit or in-game)

Go to http://mumble.sourceforge.net/, then in the “**Get Mumble**” section, select the appropriate OS-appropriate installer for your computer.  The stable version is recommended.  Run the .msi after it finishes downloading.  If you need help with the installation process, please refer to http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Installing_Mumble

 After finishing installation, you will need to add the Summoner School Mumble server to your favorites.  Minimizing the ‘Public Internet’ server list by clicking on the minus is highly recommended.  To add the server, simply click ‘Add New...’, then add the following info:

Address: **mbl7.gameservers.com**
Port: **10054**

Label is how it will show up in your servers list, and Username will..  well, be your username.  When you’re done, if you were me, it would look something like it does in the screenshot provided in the album.

Click OK, then you’ll be at your server list.  Select Summoner School and click Connect.  When you try to connect, you may be greeted by a dialog box asking about certificates.

If you get this (example provided in the album as well), just go ahead and click Yes.  It’s fine.  Then, you should be on the Summoner School server.

If you cannot connect after installation, you may just need to close Mumble, then reopen it.  On occasion, the client will not connect to the server after the initial install, but after restarting it, everything will work fine.

There are two things that I recommend doing once you’ve connected.  The first is clicking on **Configure** -&gt; **Settings** -&gt; **Overlay**, then unchecking the **Enable Overlay** button (unless you want to see the list of everyone in the channel and who’s talking during gameplay.  From here, you can resize it and move it to where you want it to be on the screen).  After doing this, close out of the current window and go back to the main Mumble screen.  Click on **Configure** again, then run the **Audio Wizard**.


***Audio Wizard***

Select the appropriate devices that you want to use for your incoming and outgoing sound.  Normally, whatever is default should be okay, but if you want to use a specific device, you can pick it from the drop-down menus.  Click **Next**.

Make use of the slider bar to find the lowest latency at which you hear no interruptions in sound, or jitter, then click **Next**.

This is the first chance you’ll get to make sure that your microphone is set up correctly in Mumble.  Read over the instructions, then use the slider bar to set the appropriate volume.

If you want to set it up so that no one hears you talk unless you’re holding down a specific button, then leave it set to Push to Talk.  Click in the box once, then push the button you’d like to use for Push to Talk.  If you want it set to always be transmitting, follow the directions listed underneath the slider to make sure that Mumble doesn’t pick up every little noise made in the background where you are.

Under quality, the default selection is fine under most circumstances.  If you find that Mumble is causing you to lag (if you’re on dialup, for example), move it to low quality, but balanced should be fine.  You’re welcome to set it to high, as well.  This is a personal choice more than anything.  I don’t recommend leaving text to speech on, due to silly behavior in channels at times.

After step 5, you should be done and ready to join other summoners in Mumble.  To swap channels, just double-click on the channel you want to join or right-click and select Join Channel.",[TIPS],False,self,t5_2t9x3,True,tips,badge-vendryth,True,t3_tawix,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tawix/tutorial_step_by_step_setting_up_mumble_for/,

I recently bought Thresh and have been playing with him for two weeks now.

Needless to say, I have found out that I am horrible at Thresh and I don't know what exactly I am doing wrong. I see a lot of people saying that Thresh is awesome and fun, but the more I play him, the more I start to dislike playing as him since I just can't play him at all. Not saying he isn't fun and awesome, I just suck playing him and sucking obviously isn't fun.

Now let's get on to my playstyle. I really like playing aggressive support, but I feel like I am focusing too much on landing my Death Sentence instead of trying to AA the enemy champs at bot lane. Not to mention I probably miss most of the grabs (I'm horrible at skillshots). If I am facing a bot lane that knows how to play against Thresh (staying behind minions, going aggressive when grab misses), I feel like I can't do anything.

If we fall behind on bot lane, that's also where I feel like I can't do much. Going all-in at this point I feel like is too risky, unless the enemy bot lane has lost HP/oom. I could be wrong, I could be seriously underestimating Thresh's all-in capability when he is behind.

At late game I mostly play to protect the ADC, but if I can land a dream grab, I'll usually initiate and hope that my team follows up properly. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't and it ends up just me dying. This could be bad timing from me though.

My build: I currently have 1/13/16 masteries for Thresh and I run Armor marks, armor seals, MR glyphs and GP10 quints.

I want you guys to open your eyes to several things I've discovered just recently, after playing League for nearly two years and after too many games, ranked, normal, even a shameless 500+ games of Dominion.

First off, to all the people who think they deserve Challenger. Or even the next tier. *No*, League of Legends is not an easy game. Don't expect to keep queueing and queueing and then just go up. That may or may not happen, on a very, very slow basis, but I'm going to be blunt. *You're wasting your time.* No, honestly. I wasted 200+ games in Gold 1 that was precious time that I wish I could have taken back. I would redo those games if I could.

Queue into ranked with the mindset to improve. I've seen people with thousands and thousands of games played, ranked and normal alike, yet they still don't have a good grasp of the game, both mechanics and decision making alike. That's a waste of time in my eyes. It's okay if you're playing for fun, that's a different story, but I'm sure we're all here to improve. *Don't waste time.* Actively seek ways to become a better player.

Secondly, League of Legends is a chess board. No, seriously, it is. I won't have it any other way.
""Guys, my bot lane fed 0/9 by 10 minutes, I couldn't do anything.""

""My teammates are so bad, even though I do well in my lane, I couldn't carry.""

Sounds like you.

Hell, it even sounds like me, and yes, there are times when one can't do anything, but then how can you explain all the Diamonds and Challengers that carry their way so easily out of several Leagues at once? I started ranked and Saintvicious' Smurf was in my League. (Xin Zhao's Elite, Gold V, at the time.) Two weeks later, he was Diamond 1 in less than a hundred games. Those straight wins.

You know how they do it? They destroy the Nexus. Yep, that's it. (Here's a tip [and a spear behind it!]: In case you didn't know, that's how you win the game.)

League of Legends isn't about your feeder teammates, your bad AD carry, your 0/8 mid, or even your champion and your KDA. They're just mere pawns. It's about how you cause that Nexus to explode, that final piece, *the king*. And it's about how you get there. And you won't do that by walking around looking for kills, wasting time standing around in the jungle, or even by farming, *yes*, farming.

Actively be doing things to improve the game towards winning at all times. Honestly. Playing jungle is the best way to practice this, but you can do it with any role, even support.

Winning your bot lane, yet mid and top are doing poorly? Push your bot tower down and GO MID IMMEDIATELY. Stop wasting time farming, where are you going to get with that? Pick people off, ward, CALL ****ING DRAGON CAUSE NO ONE IS GOING TO EXCEPT YOU. Trust me, I've won games where every single lane went negative. I'm not joking. I came into teamfights with bruisers and mids that have more than ten kills, yet the game was still winnable.

Really, kids, stop thinking about your KDA. While it's a huge aspect, I agree, it doesn't determine whether the Nexus explodes or not. Game isn't coded so that the enemy team automatically surrenders when you're like 11/0. Mechanics are great, they're a way to taking objectives, but it definitely doesn't win all your games. Everyone is all hype about FoTM champs, latest builds, OP stuff. That can take you up to a certain degree, but it certainly won't help you improve at the game at all.

Lastly, small things count. They really do. Just one decision can change your whole game. I'll label a few examples here.

1. My team manages to countergank enemy team, and all of them nearly die. It is going well. My bot lane and me (jungler) gather in the tri bush down bot, ready to recall. We're all quite low, but the enemy jungler doesn't know this. He thinks we're jungling. I ping for them to stay in the bush and not recall. Moments later, as predicted, enemy jungler comes in and facechecks. Combined with the CC, and the instant 3v1, he dies. Enemy team surrenders immediately, and yes, mainly due to that ONE decision making.

2. I gank bot lane early and net bot lane a first blood off enemy Sona.  I decide to recall in bottom bush (blue side), but then decide to stay because enemy Varus was retarded enough (Plat League, by the way) to stick around in a warded top bush against a still alive support and AD carry. I gank him a second time, and there was the second kill of the game, not to mention that bot lane was pretty much over at that point and after focusing top and mid lanes, game ended with Nexus blowing up before 30 minutes. A huge contribution mainly due to the fact I decided to stay that extra five seconds.

Every small thing counts. That one missed ult that could change a teamfight. That one decision to take a tower to net your mid an early Deathcap. They all stack up. Learn to take the initiative.

And that is all.

1362192592.0,48,self.summonerschool,19i3vw,Quinn first impressions from a diamond 1 player.,Muffit,59,11,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19i3vw/quinn_first_impressions_from_a_diamond_1_player/,"Hey guys, i picked up quinn and i wanted to share my thoughts and some tips for you guys.

So first off, her kit is quite confusing, but it does feel like she's a botlane champion, might be able to be built bruiser-ish top but that remains to be seen.

Let's cover the abilties.

The passive is pretty unique and very fun, making last hitting easier. Basically it marks an enemy minion/champion (prioritizing champions), making your next auto do bonus damage, giving you attack speed with W's passive. It seems choppy sometimes (prioritizes high hp minions over low, even tho it should prioritize the low ones), but it's still a really solid harassing tool, and it makes csing easier.

Q is a skillshot blind that gets blocked by minions. Missile speed is brand Q-like, quite slow but still fast enough to make it hard to dodge. This is great in bot lane where you can win trades easily if you land the blind on the enemy ad, aswell as in teamfights where you can blind the people diving on you. 

W has a passive that gives you attack speed when you attack a marked target, and when activated reveals a large area around you for about 1-2 seconds. This is really good if you're scared of ganks, and it makes trading really good and it scales well into late. Should be picked level 1.

E is a honestly the ability i'm the most dissapointed by atm. It's really fun but it bugs out alot. It jumps to your target, deals a low amount of damage, slows them and places you in a range depending on how close/far away from the target you are. When close, it should place you further away and vice versa, but it doesn't really do that atm. It's a really REALLY cool ability that can be used to a HUGE potential. Example: i was chased by the enemy xin from bot, got forced into the dragon pit with flash down and i thought i was done. Not so much, i managed to E the xin, jumping me over the dragon wall into safety. I tried to duplicate this but it's really hard to do, since the range is so weird and it's still quite buggy. Think tristana jump.


R is really weird, too. It's great for chasing down low targets, but i feel it's really lackluster damage-wise and scales poorly. It transforms you into a bird, making you melee, gives you huge movespeed (decays in combat), and makes your Q a small aoe, same effect.  W gives more attack speed when you attack a marked (vurnerable) target. E rushes to your target, but does not jump back, so you need to use this carefully; it's an all-in ability. Activating R a second time will rain a hail of arrows around you, dealing more damage to wounded targets (think nidalee cougar form Q, elise spider form q etc.). The damage seems really lackluster and the range is quite low. I feel like this is a chasedown ultimate only, since you need to get up close and personal in bird-form. Your cooldowns in human and bird form SHARE cooldown. What this mean is if you E in in bird form, and then want to get out with your E in human form, it will be on cooldown. I learned this the hard way, so be sure to be really really careful with this.



Skill order R&gt;W&gt;E&gt;Q

I think W is the best to level first due to the attack speed steroid. Reduced cd on active is nice too, more safety and utility.

E lowers the cd, which is nice. Damage is still really weak so this is only for utility.

Q can be upped second, but it does quite low damage and blind duration doesn't go up, so i feel like the only reason to up it is to get lower cd. 

R whenever, obviously.


Items: The new botrk. It is SO powerful on ad carries and it synergizes great with your kit. You can E in, pop the botrk (blade of the ruined king) and have a huge slow+burst damage with vurnerable auto+borkdmg+e dmg. 

Start dorans/boots+3/long sword+2. i reccomend dorans since it gives you the most stats and makes you weak to dorans counters if you started any other items. Start boots/longsword if you love pots instead of the auto attack sustain.

Rush blidgewater into instant bork. Get attack speed boots.

After this you should get IE or statikk shiv. IE will give you HUGE damage, but statikk shiv is nice for the mobility it provides. Whichever you chose, you should get a LW afterwards, since your enemies should have some armor now. After this you should get the part you didnt get before(IE/statikk/pd). Finish your build with warmogs/ga, or bloodthirster if you're a real baller. 

botrk-&gt;zerks-&gt;ie-&gt;lw-&gt;pd-&gt;warmogs is the ideal build.

Boot enchant is furor or homeguard.

And it's advice on how to carry ,and what that really means.

Of course sometimes it's just farming up a lot, getting the kills and nuking things. And that's fine, keep doing that. But sometimes it's not as simple as that. 

I was duo'ing with a friend today. I was top lane, he was AD. We both won our lane pretty hard. By 20 minutes he was 3/0/3 and up about 40 cs, I was 1/0/1 and up about 70 cs.

But we still lost. 

Our team sucked. We had a trynd jungle who waited way to long for ganks, and got super behind on farm. We had pantheon support who kept dying and refused to buy wards and a mid lane Cho gath who sucked. 

This was versus an olaf, kog, nunu, skarner and Lux. 

After the game we analysed it (which we always do, you should also do it, and be honest with yourselves) and both agreed that we thoroughly won our lanes. 

Obviously our team comp wasn't really ideal, and our teammates did not play well (even though we tried to be supportive (dont worry, just be careful, etc)).  

We came to the stage where we're thinking:

""I don't understand how high ELO players can carry in this situation, what could I have done differently? What would they do that I didn't? I just couldn't carry hard enough. If it was doublelift or some other pro AD carry, how would they win in this situation?"".

After thinking about it, I realised that we could have won that game. If we had communicated a bit better early on and agreed that this wasn't looking good for us, and we should try to close this game out sooner, I would have dropped top tower, gone bot and dropped that, then dragon and mid tower, and so on. We forgot to look further ahead and just focused on winning our current situation, and not thinking how it would affect the rest of the game.

I really think that if we had done what I said above, we would have won. Inste

And this might be really obvious to some people, but to low ELO players its not. 

Carrying isn't restricted to high kills and high CS.

I went into my next game with as positive an attitude as I could muster, this time solo, and as jungle nocturne.

Top lane teemo lost to singed pretty early on (teemo is the counter to singed..), mid katarina was doing ok vs swain, shen was in their jungle, and ez + blitzcrank were bot vs Ali + draven. Bot lane was pretty scrappy and they traded kills, so it was about even.

But from looking at the team comp alone, you should be able to tell that they have an advantage as the game gets longer. Blitzcrank will always be able to do his wonderful initiate, whereas Alistar's will just get more and more risky, as they get more damage. Katarina will not do well vs the stuns, disables and silences of their team, Singed will keep getting stronger and really harass our team, while being hard to kill, Shen will be able to split push and Ulti to people, and Ez will get fed. 

So I decided to take control. Put pressure on mid to help kat get farm, went bot forced a fight and we killed ezreal then quickly took bot tower, and then took dragon. I was still level 5 at this time, but we did it. 

Next was mid, and then top. My team kept doing stupid things like not backing, or trying to start fights out numbered, chasing for kills etc. But I kept focusing on taking the objectives.

And we won. It's probably the hardest I've ever carried a game (and I've carried a LOT). Normally I carry by being fed and just being able to blow people up, but I carried this game by outplaying the enemy team.

And I think that's something anyone can do. It didn't take great mechanics, it just took a bit of thinking. 

I know this post was super long and constructed terribly, but I hope someone will read it and be able to benefit from my experience. 

I really think that just having this kind of mindset will really help. Flaming your team mates for feeding never makes them play better, and it doesn't help you win games. When your team mates suck, and you can sense a loss incoming, take control. End your laning phase (I know it's tempting to stretch it out if you're winning), start impacting the other lanes. CARRY.

I don't mean to bombard you guys with posts every single week with my videos, so I'll slow it down every now and again but I feel that this concept is such a crucial point in becoming a better player that it demands to be taken into consideration.

In this video, I try to explain the basic mechanics of CSing, and what you should be looking out for when doing so. By playing a custom game you can begin to learn patterns and get used to the cast times and animation times of the champion you're learning to last hit with. I do slightly go over the actual laning mechanic when you're facing other opponents, but that will be covered in more detail in a second part to this video.

The whole purpose of using the custom game is that there's no pressure apart from your own goals to perform. It's the perfect 10 minute practice run and can help you learn a lot about your champion and how the lane works.

Apart from that, as always, if you have any feedback feel free to let me know. If you want to add me in-game my name is Garamor (NA server).

1347815176.0,45,self.summonerschool,zz6z6,When is getting a kill not worth it? Lets do some Math,,59,14,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/zz6z6/when_is_getting_a_kill_not_worth_it_lets_do_some/,"One thing new player should learn IMO is when is a kill not worth it.

First off we are going to discuss threat:

Threat aka bounty is the value of an enemy champion in gold compared to base value of 300. Threat increases on kills and decreases on deaths. Threat is uneffected by multi-kills, and has a reduced effect from assists. 

http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kill

A bounty table can be found at the link above. With the exception of First Blood all base line kills are worth 300 gold. After any kill streak or deathstreak is reset the value returns to 300.

So for example 0/4/0 is worth 135 gold (5th death on bounty list) upon death. However if they get 1 kill they reset to 300. If they get 2 kills they remain at 300 apposed to increasing to 330. This is cause the reset is not included in the streak. 

The same goes for a player who is 5/0/0 if they die they return to 300 they do not reduce to 273 until they die again. 

Assists are worth 7/12th (58.33% for those who hate fractions) a kill or at base level 175 and on first blood 233. Assist value are directly related to kill values. Assist gold is equaly spilt rounding up on the last assister. So 2 assisters worth 175 total provides 87 &amp; 88 respectively. The portrait closest to the kill portrait earns the extra 1 gold.

Assist only increase threat if they are currently on a death streak. 2 assists will increase your threat 1 level but never past 300 bounty. Example 0/5/0 goes 0/5/2 bounty is worth 135 not 106. 

So why is this important? 

Well lets say we have a 0/3/0 top lane champion. Gold lost to enemy champion (excluding missed CS score) is 300 + 273 + 216 = 789
Now this champion kills the enemy champion with an assist from the jungler. He earns 363 and the jungler earns 212 = 575. The global difference is 214 or approximately 7 CS.

The Kill/Death ratios are: 3.0 and 0.33 but the gold which matters is minimal. 

This is a very interesting thing to look at. Often people are called feeders cause they are 0/3/0 for example. They provided 789. But someone who goes 3/3/0 provides 789 to 936 gold depending on the order of their kills and deaths. So in reality the 3/3/0 is the feeder. 

Now this isn't the whole story experience plays a role as well right? 

http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_(champion)

""The experience gained is equal to 75% of the total experience required for a champion to go from the slain champion's current level to the next level up. In other words, if a level 7 champion is slain, the total experience gained is 75% of the total experience required for a champion to go from level 7 to level 8, or 862.5 experience points."" 

Getting kills on someone a lower level then you earns less ecperience the larger the gap. At a 2 level gap the experience earn by the lower level champ is between 125 - 175% of the experience in the opposite exchange.  

However if this is assisted the experience is equally spilt between the number of assisting champions. So a 4 man gank is worth minimal experience vs a one on one exchange. 

So when is it ""worth it""?

First off any exchange where you get a kill and an assist vs a kill is worth it (assuming bounties are at base or higher) At a 4 death streak killing someone increases your bounty by more then they are worth in gold to you. At 5 the gold earned from a kill and an assist is worth less then the increase in your bounty.

So a player with a high K/D rating could earn less gold then one with a low one depending on how much gold is exchanged. 

In short KDR (kill death ratio) is a pointless stat as there are too many variables who aren't accounted for.

I have played League at just about every competitive level (up to about just over 2k solo q) and some tournament team play way back when.


I have always liked that when I have introduced new players into the game, the LoL community has greatly aided and supported them in starting out. I personally started playing on the US server and the amount of helpful constructive comments from players around me was incredible.


I am a bit new to Reddit but hope at some point soon to be putting out my own guides, etc. to aid people at improving their gameplay, especially new players. MOBA Games have a lot of depth to them and League of Legends is no exception. The more knowledge you get about the game, the better equipped you are to make decisions but I know this can seem like a very big hurdle to start with.


I am looking to find out what new players want in terms of support whether it be guides, videos, commentaries or simply someone to answer their questions. So, I am happy to be here and answer any questions you might have at all and if you can leave me any feedback on that, would greatly appreciate it.

**Note** - Have any questions or topics you'd like fr me to write about? PM me and I'll make it happen, 9/10 someone else will be wondering the same thing, so when you're asking, you're not only helping yourself but helping the rest of the community too, send those PMs, I love them! Thanks again guys.

**Farming**

Farming is the act of CSing, i.e. killing creeps to ""farm"" for Gold so that you can buy items for your build. 

 * The importance of this is monumental to your success in a game for it affects your DMG Potential, Morale, % of Winning if you're behind, etc.

 * It allows you to catch back up if you're at a gold disadvantage, e.g. You and your team lost a teamfight at Dragon, giving the enemy team a heavy gold advantage, i.e. possibly allowing the enemy ADC to finish his/her Infinity Edge before your ADC finishes his/her's. Start farming to catch up. 

 * To practice CSing, I'd recommend going into a custom game for about 20 minutes and learning to last hit with a champion of your choice. **Remember** that each and every champion's ""style"" of last hitting is very different, i.e. Anivia's and Ahri's last hitting can be abysmal due to their low AS and AD basic stats, so learning each champion's ""groove"" when last hitting is a key to success.

 * Even when doing that though, is definitely not enough, for you can only learn how to truly CS and Farm when in actual Normal and/or Ranked games, for you have to not only focus on farming, but **also** on map awareness, responding to pressure from enemy lane aggro, your HP, etc. So, although I recommend to do the 20 minutes in a custom game, I recommend more heavily that you practice as you play.in Normal games. 

 * Never stop farming throughout the whole game, unless you're maxed out, e.g. you only can buy consumables, i.e. Fort. Pot, Oracle's. etc.  

**Important** - Remember what you're farming for. Items. Which items specifically? The items that are best for the current situation you're in. It also helps immensely if you know the amount of Gold needed till you complete a big ticket item, e.g. Deathfire's Grasp, Infinity Edge, Athene's Holy Grail. 

 * Also, telling and communicating with your team on your build helps as well, for it keeps them in mind of your DMG potential while also his/her's, e.g. you may type ""500 g till DFG for enemy Caitlyn,"" which may make your team ""stall"" while you go and farm that quickly and then buy it. Communication is key guys, always, always communicate with your team. 

Hope you guys enjoyed today's Tip for Success, remember that you're always welcome to comment on it and add anything of your own in the comments section, cause you'll be helping me and the rest of the community by doing so.

I feel in the moment of S3 Qualifiers going on, a lot of people are inspired to go out and improve and maybe try become one of the people who are on a team in the S4 championship series. Because of this, and just to help those who want to learn in general, I want to reach out to you redditors who are experienced in anything relating to this game whether it just be the game, a lane, or even just a single champion who are willing to give the tips ranging from small obvious things to high-level advanced concepts which people may not think of at first.

If this gets enough attention, I'll probably end up compiling a huge list of tips and other stuff you guys submit here into a large document and re-post it for all to enjoy. I've also posted this to /r/leagueoflegends, but it didn't get much love there from the auto-downvoters who don't even read the thread :[

I'll start. I play mid and I mained Evelynn for around a month and Katarina for a few months so I'd like to share some tips with those champions and all other roles because I've mained every role (except jungle) before my swap to Mid :]

**Evelynn**

* Your ultimate has a small delay before the shield actually goes off, so if you are baiting someone make sure you land your ulti before the actual killing blow goes off, or you will just deal damage and not get a shield (This aggrivates me to hell because I've died an endless amount of times because of this delay)

* Your builds will ALWAYS be different from game to game. For example, if the general threat level of the enemy team is from one squishy person (a carry), DFG is an AMAZING item to get first because it allows you to instantly 100-0 someone with a single rotation of DFG-R-E-Q (and maybe 1-2 more Qs if they're tanky). If the threat is coming a tanky person, a magic penetration build is strong to help deal as much damage as possible to them (Liandra/Abyssal/Rylai/Void Staff) and be able to survive the fight as long as them. If the threat is spread across the enemy team, a raw damage with a bit of tankiness build is highly viable to be able to have the largest multi-target damage possible (with huge R dmg and spammable high damage Qs) such as Rabadon-&gt;Rylai or something along those lines.

* Roam early if top or bot is being pushed by the enemy early. NOBODY expects this. I can't tell you how many times I've rushed Doran's Ring at level 1, shoved the hell out of the lane early and ganked a side lane at level 2 with QE for easy first blood. (QW if they have a slow you need to mitigate). This is a very strong tactic against natural pushers or snowballers such as Singed, Jax, Akali, or champions without an escape mechanism/flash. However, I wouldn't recommend roaming at level 2 if top or bot doesn't end up pushing because if you fail the gank, you will fall a huge margin behind in lane.

* Don't forget your W gets a reset on kill or assist. This is very useful for chasing enemies in a teamfight. Also remember to time your Ws (if you get resets) that you get the longest amount of high-MS as possible.


**Katarina**

* As tempting as it may be just to E into the teamfight and spin to win, this is almost always a terrible idea because if the enemy is smart, they will be waiting to CC you when you ult so the best option is to jump into the fight and use your abilities and wait for a few second before ulting and try to position yourself within your team but at a point to get the most damage off as possible.

* Sometimes you should let your team die before you engage a fight. Katarina is strongest when the enemies are chunked low from a fight.

* Katarina is played best on an AoE damage team comp because generally an AoE composition is good at chunking enemies for the people like the AD carry to clean up and generally keeps the enemy on the defensive. With this comp (as stated above) Katarina will dominate a fight by cleaning up the mess left from all the chunked people.

* I'm not going to say this is the best thing to do, but I find gunblade to be an insanely strong item on Katarina because (IIRC) her W scales off of AD (which benefits from gunblade if you're maxing W) and because of gunblade's new feature on its active, it now scales off of AP which makes it even easier to chunk and 100-0 someone in a fight to cause the devastating ""Katarina reset chain"". I almost always build it fight because it has insanely high damage and sustain for its cost. It also allows you to not become a ""build-MR-to-beat"" champion via the AD.

* ALWAYS. CARRY. WARDS. Holy crap, I can't stress this enough, even though this is an overall rule, you should always do this on Katarina and buy an extra 1-2 on her too because wards are literally a free gank-escaper if you place one and shunpo to it across a wall or toward your turret. Trust me.


The next tips I'll give are just some general basics of each lane I've mained that I feel should be said. This is what I mainly created this thread to share (as in these types of tips, not my information) but specifics on champions seemed like a good idea, so I decided to include that too.

**Mid lane**

* Roam. ROAM. ROAAAAAAMMM. I feel like this is THE defining feature of a good middle laner is their skill of roaming. Knowing when to roam and the effectiveness of roaming is what can seperate a won game from a loss game. Notice when lanes are pushed, when they don't have wards, and push to go gank them ASAP.

* If you can't roam, farm or crush your own lane. Farm everything. Wraiths, wolves, blue, minions, towers, whatever you can. If you have no infleunce over your side lane then you must crush your own lane on top of farming your best also. You will not be able to carry the lane alone through farm. You have to crush your lane and zone him, make him useless.

* Know your strong points. For example, some champions are strongest level 1-4, some 6, some 9, and some not at all until 11-18. For example, pantheon's strongest point is 1-4 (although this is debatable because of black cleaver, or getting fed). Riven's strongest point if 1 to 7 (level 6 damage is ridiculous). Karthus' point is once he maxes Q and gets level 2 ult (11+) and so on. Know your strong points and manipulate them going hard when you hit it, same thing goes for your enemy. Know your ENEMY'S strong points and strike before or after it when they're weak. Example being punishing Vladimir around 1-5 before he gets a high level in Q when his sustain becomes out of hand. And so on.

**Top lane**

* This lane snowballs HARD. Probably the hardest in the entire game. You mess up and give olaf first blood? Guess what he's back into lane with a giants belt compared to your one 500g item or something. Suddenly, he's unkillable and he harasses you like crazy with his neverending E or Q. Jax or Riven gets an early kill or you have to back early? Then they get 6 before you and you're screwed basically. Know the amount this lane snowballs and make sure you are cautious in your actions. One wrong move and you lose the lane instantly.

* Don't just sit there! If you're pushed up to an enemy tower and they're just freezing it there do NOT just stay there, ROAM. Take enemy jungle, roam to mid, make plays, take dragon. You can't just sit top or you're wasting your time. Punish them for freezing the lane. Make them push it back to where you want the lane, then freeze it at your own tower but be prepared to instantly shove it to enemy tower if you see them leave. However, if you're against a weak pusher like Shen or Poppy, shoving to enemy tower and roaming is an insanely strong tactic since you are likely not going to get kills in that lane anyway.

* Know your team, if they're an all damage team with no tank, BUILD TANKY. If you have a galio mid with an amumu jungle, BUILD DAMAGE. Most top laners can be successful both a damage and tank role so make sure you pay attention to what your team needs and adapt for it.

**For ALL lanes**

* WATCH YOUR ENEMIES COOLDOWNS. THIS INCLUDES SUMMONERS. Know exactly when enemy spells are on cooldown and abuse them while they're down if its one of their main damage spells. For example, if Vladimir QE's a minion wave, HARASS HIM. He has NO way of punishing you for 4-5 seconds. If the enemy wastes a flash/ghost or just simply doesn't have one (exhaust/ignite, heal/ignite) make your jungler gank for free kills. Know your enemies and capitalize on their mistakes.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this post and I hope you guys have learned something new and I also hope that you guys will submit tips of your own in the comment section! This post is becoming close to being max-length so I'll write up the bot lane tips and submit them in the comment section if this thread gets enough attention.

1357890385.0,46,self.summonerschool,16db6x,A way of looking at autoattacks that might help beginners last hit better,fomorian,56,10,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/16db6x/a_way_of_looking_at_autoattacks_that_might_help/,"Think of your autoattack as being a spell with a very short cooldown. When your autoattack is off cooldown, it will fire immediately. When it is on cooldown because you have recently used an autoattack, it will wait a moment before firing. What this means is if you know you have an autoattack cooldown of about 2 second, the usual for most champions at level 1, you can't be autoattacking something two second before you intend to last hit a minion. If you do, there will be a small delay before you champion will be able to cast his autoattack, which might make you miss your last hit. You can make that cooldown shorter by buying attack speed items. Hon actually uses this terminology: if you mouse over your attack speed, it refers to your autoattack's cooldown. I just thought it was interesting and helps people visualize how to lasthit. 

Another thing to consider is projectile travel time. If you are standing next to the minion you are about to attack as a ranged character, your projectile will not have to travel as far as if you were attacking it at max range. Not suggesting you move right next to a minion to autoattack it always, just something to take into account if you plan on autoattacking from range. 

Also, keep in mind that different champions' autoattacks move at different speeds. Soraka's projectile for instance moves really slowly, while graves' autoattack is much more responsive. This can be both a good and bad thing. Because soraka's autoattacks are less responsive than others, it makes it harder to time your last hits correctly. However, there is a plus to having slow moving projectiles. It makes it easier to harass someone under turret and retreat before pulling turret aggro.

If you ever have a moment in game, take some time to observe how slowly caster minions' projectiles travel. They are much slower than any champion's projectiles by far. Keeping track of which minons your caster minions have aggroed will make you a much better last hitter, and keeping in mind that your projectile will always travel faster than a caster minion's will also help.

Today, I would like to talk about gaining elo by the game winning the games that you should be winning.

People talk so about the games that they are like 2-0 a lane and complain about how they cannot carry their team.  The fact is that there are going to some games that you just cannot win.  But why don't people talk about the games that are like 29-28 and they accidentally facecheck a bush that causes the team to get aced.  Or the game that you were up 15 kills and threw the game.  Gaining elo is more about winning the games that you should.  When the game matters, don't get caught, don't miss key skills, don't have poor focus, don't forget to ward baron, etc.  And don't throw away leads by being to aggressive.  If you know it is going to be a bad tower dive, dragon, or baron, then tell your team to leave.  Surprisingly enough, the majority of the games are in your hands (I know this is heavily opposed by many of the players, so let me hear your case).

I little of topic, but I wanted to include this: If you are really fed, any loss is basically 99% your fault.  If you every go like 7-0 and you lose, it is your fault.  Sure your team might lead you into throwing or have bad decisions, but you should still be able to carry it out.  Also getting fed 7-0 requires no real skill and really shouldn't be seen as you ""carrying"" games.  I have had so many X-0 games, but basically I do nothing in those games.  Your opponent just doesn't know how to handle you and just doesn't know what to do.

1334515638.0,44,self.summonerschool,sb3lt,"Opportunity cost: the difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" build choices (and light theorycrafting 101)",jtiza,49,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/sb3lt/opportunity_cost_the_difference_between_good_and/,"I've been running into this a lot recently - discussions about item choices or summoner spells that get sidetracked early because people are arguing over the use of the word ""good.""

Riot did a pretty great job at giving the player a ton of options to customize their champions.  Different items, spells, runes, and masteries can be combined to suit your role or playstyle.  You get value out of almost any item choice, with very few exceptions.  You can see this from the extreme flexibility of some champions (e.g. Gangplank), or why people can play troll builds and still do well.  In short, **almost every build choice helps make the champion stronger in some way**.

The problem is that **item builds are ""bad"" because of opportunity cost (what you give up from other options), not because the stats don't help**.  Yes, picking up a Frozen Mallet on your ranged AD carry will help you chase and survive longer.  However, by getting that extra health and passive, you're *giving up on the damage you'd have if you bought an IE instead*.  This is why people say Clarity is bad.  This is why you don't build damage on your supports, you don't stack Archangels, and you don't get GP10 items on everybody.  In order to label item builds as good or bad, you have to **compare what you're trying to accomplish with the potential alternatives**.

**tl;dr - build choices are ""bad"" because other things are better, even if they provide some value themselves.**

**More in-depth example + theorycrafting 101 below:**

If you're a ranged AD carry, your job is to dish out physical damage by the truckload on whoever's in range.  That's basically it.  If you're building an AD carry, you need to take your ultimate goal - damage - and weight your choices based on that.  FroMal gives you 20 AD - that's good!  We like AD!  But IE gives you 80 AD, AND crits for days.  So now, we weigh the other benefits of FroMal versus IE to see how they compare:

**Frozen Mallet**

* 20 AD
* 700 HP
* 30% slow on every AA (40% for melee, but we're talking ranged AD)

**Infinity Edge**

* 80 AD
* 25% Crit Change
* +50% Crit Damage

The AD balances itself out easily - IE is +60 AD over FroMal.  So we're left with the rest - how does 700 HP and 30% slow compare to 25% crit chance and +50% crit damage?  It's we could try to view this empirically without lots of math (which is totally doable, albeit a little complicated!), except **we already know the goal - tons of damage**.  A ranged AD is, well, ranged, so survivability is less important.  The slow is a nice bonus, good for chasing down those stragglers, but **chasing down stragglers is not as important as doing da damages**.

In this case, **building Frozen Mallet is bad on a ranged AD because you could have bought Infinity Edge**.  This continues down the line - you have IE, so maybe NOW we build FroMal?  Well, the alternative would be Phantom Dancer for the AtSpd and Crit chance (which IE loves so very much), and we immediately see that doing more damage with PD is more important than tanking with FroMal.  So on and so on, until we're left with the standard AD carry build - IE, PD, LW, etc, of which FroMal is not included.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,True,,badge-ten,True,t3_sb3lt,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/sb3lt/opportunity_cost_the_difference_between_good_and/,

1) Reading dying Creeps as a Support/ADC and harassing

Most people in Bronze/Silver know they NEED to harass but don't know how or when is the time to do it. An extremely effective way to make your enemy ADC lose CS is to use your allied dying creeps, read the enemy and react.

For example, say you have an allied caster minion just about to die, you can assume the enemy ADC will shortly move into position, to last hit it. Therefore you can react, position yourself into range, and just before the enemy stops (this will take some experience, knowing the AA range of different champs is important) fire off your harass. This achieves one of two things;

1) Your harass connects with the enemy, who is in their own AA animation and cannot harass you back. They got the CS but they took damage, and you took none. The important part is the not taking damage bit. 

2) You fire off your harass and the enemy dodges it, but misses the dying creep and loses gold. This is also effective because if you do this constantly through laning phase you can make the enemy miss alot of CS giving you/your ADC a big advantage.

Both of thesse outcomes is a positive gain for your duo in bot lane. I find the caster minions (minions who shoot the spells out of their wands) to be most effective using this strategy. Stand on or very close to the dying creeps, then blast your harass off like I described above.

2) Ganking right when the enemy goes to CS

Too often I see wasted ganks because the jungler is impatient or just has little knowledge of how and when they should gank. One of the most effective ways is using your own dying creeps to know where the enemy is going to move, reacting, and getting a good gank off.

For example, a good player will have good map awareness and will check their minimap regularly to know what is going on. A good player is hard to gank because as soon as you become visible out of the Fog of war, they have ample time to react, plan an escape strategy, and haul ass back to their turret.

If you wait for them to go last hit a creep, not only will they be a little more pushed in the lane than they were, their eyes will be directed towards the creep, this is when you want to rush in and attack. As by the time the enemy has looked at the minimap you're already half way to him. 

Now this doesn't make a huge difference, and it situational, for example if the enemy has escapes you want them to burn those before going in etc. But a good rule of thumb is to charge as soon as you see the enemy going to CS.

1373794538.0,45,self.summonerschool,1i9pdz,A few tips and a short guide on supporting,FX4568,61,16,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1i9pdz/a_few_tips_and_a_short_guide_on_supporting/,"Hi I am a main adc/support player.

This is a simple tip and guide for the people who are forced to support. 

I really notice in my ranked games (I am around gold 3/4) that not many people know how to support. I really think someone with a silver/bronze mechanics and game knowledge can reach gold by knowing how to support since not many people know how to do it. 

I understand gold 3 is not that much big of a deal to anyone, but I think this can help some people out. 

1. Wards. Your existence is all about wards. 
Always ward the tri-bush and dragon. 
If your lane is pushing a lot, and you are the blue side you should TRY warding the bush behind the tier 1 tower.
If you are the purple side and you're pushing, the normal tri-bush is ok too, and if you are feeling a little uncomfortable, warding enemy red is also a good idea. 
When doing dragon, always ward the bush nearby; the tri-bush is a must and warding behind the dragon wall is a good idea. 
When doing baron, and you are purple side, ward all the bushes nearby in 2000 range. Optimally, you want to see a lux ult. 
In the blue side doing baron, ward their wraith bush and the 2 bushes in their red and the tri-bush.
After a turret gets taken, place a ward nearby where the next turret is located. This allows you to know when the enemy leaves his turret and base. 
Always ward the wraith bushes. When the game goes over 25 minutes, it should be pinked. 
When sieging tier 3 towers, ward in between the tier 3 towers. Between the mid and bot and mid and top. This gives vision of everyone inside. 
Never ever leave the base without wards. Sightstone doesn't count. 
People tend to say that everyone should ward. That is true, but this is solo queue. Ranked 5s doesn't work in the same way as solo queue does. Accept it, you will be the only one warding. Take the burden of warding away from your teammates so they can focus on itemization. 

2. No matter what is going on in a team fight, always focus on protecting your adc. 
Unless you are leona and you are terribly ahead, try to save at least 1 or 2 cc's for when your adc is getting killed by the divers. 

3. During laning phase, always try to be ahead of your adc. If you are behind your adc, that means he is taking all the poke from both enemy support and adc.

4. Don't touch your adc's farm. If he is gone, just last hit. It's pretty straight forward. Unless your adc asks you to clear the wave, just let him have it. 

5. Always ward objectives. The game isn't about kills. It's about global gold and the nexus. 

6. Try not building bulwark. Instead, have your jungler build one. 

7. Your masteries should be 1/14/15 (optimally). Do not run 9/0/21. It's okay to run 0/30/0 in champs like leona, but never have your defense be below than 9. 

8. I will not even talk about runes since you probably don't support often.

9. Your normal start should be biscuit, 1 minute ward, 2 red pots, reju bead/faerie, 2 wards and a pink. 

10. Every time you recall, don't finish an item unless you can buy 2 wards. If you can get the item and a ward, that's fine, but tell your adc so he can play safer. 

11. Some adcs are bad. No matter how good you are, they are bad. 

12. Do not go Nidalee support. The whole point of a support in my idea is to have a skill that will allow the adc to have some ""oh shit"" recovery time. You see a hecarim ult? thresh can lantern or ult, nami can ult or q, sona can ult, zyra can snare. What does nidalee do? Poke and heal. If you must nidalee support, go back to lane at least with 2 wards each time.

13. This is generally how my build goes for support. 
Initial items &gt; finish philostone &gt; finish red sightstone &gt; boots &gt; tons of wards &gt; oracles &gt; tons of wards &gt; oracles &gt; tier 2 boots (mobility or CDR) &gt; more wards &gt; more wards &gt; oracles &gt; wards &gt; (around 40 minutes) upgrade philostone into something &gt; wards &gt; locket. 

14. You should buy an oracle around 15 minutes. They don't go away if you die, and it gives true vision. Perfect for camping bushes or taking objectives. 

Anyways, I hope this helps you a little bit when you have to support. I understand that it is one of the ""boring"" roles, but if you constantly try to find ways in which you can poke and harass the enemy adc, it's really really fun. Your adc will know when the lane was won because of you. 

Hope this helped.

Edit 1 Jul 14 19.24hrs

So regarding my starting items, the reason why I go faerie charm and not all consumables in SOLO QUEUE is because money is simply not there. Again, I go into my argument of ranked 5s is very different from solo queue. The main problem with supports is income, and a philo stone that is not evolved for at least 30 minutes, coupled with gp10 quints with utility masteries is insane. 
You can get an extra 2 wards instead of the faerie charm, but when we think of trade offs of mana regeneration (which means sustain such as nami, alistar, sona) and some poke (nami/sona) we see that 2 wards really do not produce much efficiency. 
Let us say you put the ward down at 3:15 (placing the 1 minute ward at 2:15) and you are purple side (which is pretty early if you KNOW the jungler will take blue &gt; red) ward will expire at 6:15, placing your 3rd ward (the pink one) in the tri bush, which will expire in the 9:15 mark. That is 10 minutes of vision in the tri bush from 2 wards. Obviously, 1 ward can go in either lane bush or dragon which will be placed around 3:30 / 4:30, which will last to 6:30 / 7:30. 
If you are blue side, then even better. I know I said you need to ward the tri bush, but only do so if you haven't seen then jungler for a long time. Blue side ward should be at dragon to cover one entrance, and that should last until 8/9 minutes. with 1 ward placed in either lane bush or even further out to mid lane. My point about ward timers is also based on the fact of communication, solo queue communication of ward placement is near null. Ganks are not coordinated, and you can exploit this lack of communication with a little riskier play.

Anyways, that is my reasoning for rushing philostone instead of sight stone. Yes, I do rush sight stone in ranked 5s.

lately I've been really into support, its one of my favorite roles and I have a pretty good understanding of bottom lane match ups. For example Sona can counter Taric, Janna can counter Leona, and Lulu can counter Thresh. I also know, dont just pick a champ because it ""counters"" another champ because actual player skill can account for a lot. Now here is where my question comes in, where does Soraka fall in on the support food chain? I've played her in blind picks where She’s was awesome and other game where I was pretty much just a ward that could heal people. So I never really thought she could hold her own in ranked games, but my last two ranked loses resulted from an enemy Soraka pretty much making her team unkillable. 

So how do y’all feel about Soraka, to weak for ranked, where those last two games flukes? Or does she deserve more credit than I’m giving her?

I have applied on the teacher sheet as I do enjoy giving out advice and helping out players who are trying to get better as ad carry.

I cannot answer question about, well, anything else than ad carry, since I don't know enough of the other roles to be helpful.

I have recently gotten an overwhelming amount of requests for help, and I just don't have enough time to personally play with every one of you, even if I wish I could :( I have noticed, however, that many players are struggling over the same few stuff. I have answered and talked about the same questions over pms recently, and figured this thread could be a good idea? Let's see if it works! :)

Made the thread so I could forward you here and help you guys, since perhaps you have similiar questions to others, who might be struggling with the same stuff! My general questions I asked, to determine how should I help you over the messages, and where do you stand as an adc:

Are you dying in the lanephase? Are you getting underleveled in the laning phase, or are you getting outfarmed by more than 30cs? Are you familiar with the concept of moving between autoattacks? What ad carries are you currently playing the most? What runes and what masteries on each different ad? Are you dying too much in lane? Are you winning or losing most lanes, and do you think you are often losing games when you win a lane, or often winning games when you're losing lane? Then, anything you think you're having problems with ad carrying yourself? Where do you yourself think you prosper at, what are your strong points? 

PS. I give advice from my experience, and don't hate me, but it often goes against the friendly soloQ players' please everybody style, I know. My advice is just something that I know that works, and makes people get better, its not the absolutely advice and there are many different paths to getting good at this game and enjoying playing it!

**EDIT: Here's something I've gathered so far:**

There are no easy tips or guides on itemization. The best guideline I can tell you is this:

**""As Adc, your job is to do as much damage as you can."" This means, if you think you can survive the enemy damage=buy more damage. If you think enemy will be able to kill you=buy defensive item. This, because staying alive means you will do more damage, than having that IE+LW+PD but dying instantly.**

You can also convert this guideline to laningphase, buy doran's if you think you need the extra early hp/sustain to survive from the enemy leona/graves burst, buy vampric sceptre if you think you will otherwise (eventually) die/forced out of lane prematurely by that enemy Caitlyn+Sona, and buy damage if you think you will otherwise get outraded by that vayne's insane damage output.

Most of all; Use your brains, don't trust anybody blindly, think the reasonings behind the suggested items, and Think if there could be a better option.


**When enemy bruiser is fed**, especially mid game, and you're fed as well (outfarmed your lane/killed your lane enemy even?) You have 2 options: 1. Ask your team to focus the fed bruiser, tell them to just instakill him when he joins the fray. 2. Stay All The Way Back in the teamfight. By this I mean, in the previous example, if you're 9-0 Varus against 12-0 Jax. You use Q and E (perhaps ultimate) and NO AUTOATTACKS (I know, it hurts not to aa) UNTIL the said Jax has used jump/any gapclosing abilities/summoners he might possible have on somebody else. After he has used them, you go and kill that said bruiser. Alternatively, you can try to position yourself so you can hit Hecarim, the jungler. If you see that Jax is on some certain side of the teamfight, you can go away from him and instead kill the jungler, again, until Jax has wasted his skills/summoners.

Also, if you get fed and think even if you wait until Jax has used Leapstrike, that he will just survive until he has it up again and then come at you, you need to buy survivability items. Fast giant's belt can do wonders.

**Trades** are a difficult question, which all depends on the laning matchups, and I can't really tell you about every single laning matchups, there are couple easy advantages to notice though;

Lvls, when the enemy outlvls you, he will, most probably, win the trade. Items, if the enemy has double doran's against your boots, he will win the trade. Burst versus poke, if you have sona support and enemy has leona, as long as you don't die with the sona support, you will eventually win the trade. They will do more damage, but make sure that if they focus your Sona, you start autoattacking and throwing everything you have at them!

**Positioning:** It's hard to say general advice to this, best advice is, as Genja said: ""See hero, kill hero"" Which means, you just attacks anybody who is close to you, no matter what your team wants to ""focus"". Ad carries don't have such a thing as ""focus"" You attack anybody who comes to range, and kite in order to keep them at that range. If you make one chamion low hp, and he runs away, but another one comes closer to you, you simply start attacking the another one with full hp and start kiting him instead of chasing the 300hp Leona. (No advice is foolproof, there are situations where this would be a bad choice, but generally in teamfights this is what you should do)

Repositioning via skills and summoners; Try to save them as long as you can, don't use them just because you are scared of something. First try everything you can by kiting them, if you are really about to die, reposition yourself with a skill you have, such as Caitlyn's E. With longrange ad carries such as Caitlyn, most preferable positions would be over some wall, where the enemy will have to use a gapcloser to get to, and if they don't have one, you will be safe and free to autoattack everybody. Use summoner spells as the Last Resort. Do Not Waste Them. Not on lane and not in teamfights. Only use them when it's inevitable that if you don't, you will die. Same rules applies otherwise, repositioning behind walls is good, behind corners, behind Caitlyn's trap you see lying on the ground, or even behind that squishy Sona support you have.

Zoning; again, it depends so much what you have against, what kind of an advantage you have and what are you playing as. Here comes something though:

While **zoning**, in order to do it safely and efficiently, you need to watch both your own creeps' and your enemy's creeps' health bars. You must remember to cs yourself or the zoning will not be worth it, make sure you don't miss any! As long as you don't miss any cs, you need to see how your own minion's health bars are going down. When you see your own side's minion going down, make sure to show yourself aggressive, and prepare; if the enemy goes to take that cs, you ditch out damage to him. (on extreme cases you can even do this on exp, if the enemy goes near enough to get exp you are there to AA him)

Since he will need to autoattack the creep in order to get the lasthit, you will either get free hits on him, and soon after he wont be able to come lasthit anymore, or if he decides to hit you instead, he will have missed the cs=profit.


**RECALLING**The point where you Want to recall, is when your enemy has just gone back, you shove the next wave really fast to the enemy turret(make sure you shove it all the way to the turret, not just close to it) and when the wave after this one will have a siege minion in it. If you recall straight after you have done this, you will perhaps only miss 1-2 cs while you have recalled. This is often something that determines who wins the lane, as the one who gets to recall at the most optimal times will have higher cs and higher exp in general.

However, there are times when you just have to ""suck it"" and recall at sub-optimal times. If you are very low and in danger to die, you just need to recall, it's better to lose cs and exp instead of dying AND losing that cs and exp!

It's also a decent time to recall, when your enemy has just recalled and the next minion wave is still not at either turret (this will leave the lane stale, you will lose perhaps 4 cs). Also, pushing a wave to the enemy turret while the enemy is recalled, even if the next wave has no siege minions in it will be a good time to recall. If you need to recall when the enemy is still in lane, try to have a big wave (atleast a siege minion in it, perhaps more than just 3 casters as well) and shove it all the way down to the enemy turret, and recall fast in a bush where there are no enemy wards (will buy you couple extra seconds hopefully, as the enemy is confused)

Other than this, you can always recall when the enemy does, it's never a horrible situation (unless you see your own wave currently pushing the enemy wave down, in which case is one of the worst times to recall).

It's hard to list all the good, bad and decent times to recall, but if you think about how the lane acts you will soon start noticing what are the good times and what are not. But always remember not to risk death just because you don't want to recall at a bad time. To determine a good recall is mostly about the amount of cs you lose while you are away from the lane. The cs either dies to your own minions or your turret, you can always look at the lane and see how many cs you die, and see what you could've done differently in order to not lose so much!

The EXP difference can also result from the enemy laners doing golems, perhaps frequenting them, which will lead in a significant exp advantage, starting from lvl 1 golems which will get them lvl 2 faster.** (danger zone here, beaware of this tactic)**


**21-0-9 and 21-1-8** (taking barrier mastery from defense tree when you're using barrier) Is Very strong mastery build.

Doing this, will let you have that extra mana regen, which can mean life and death, or kill or non, in a game, where you otherwise might miss that 5 mana for a skill. Manaregen is considered being stronger than that extra armor in defense tree because of this, as the armor will make you last perhaps 1 extra AA, usually not even that.

What makes the utility tree even Stronger, is the flash cdr reduction AND overall summoner spell cdr, which makes you have the summoner spells 30 seconds earlier, than the enemy who doesn't use the utility masteries. This 30 seconds gap on barrier/flash you both used at the same time previously, will not be a huge advantage, and 30 seconds where you can kill/out-trade the enemy.

**19-0-11**The extra 2 points in utility will mean you will have Even More lifesteal, to negate even more of that poke the enemy will be doing, making you have higher average hp in the laningphase, and therefore hopefully ensure you get more farm/trade better/have higher hp when the enemy engages on you.

Lifesteal set up basically just keeps your hp higher in lane. So, if you're afraid that the enemy might be poking you in laningphase, having that extra lifesteal will negate much of the effects of the poke, and let you get more farm than what you would otherwise.

**When you are ahead in lane, you generally have 2 options:**

**1. You freeze the lane and zone, or take your side golems every time after pushing, and therefore gaining advantage in CS and exp.**

**2. You push down the turret hard**, getting your team global goal and freeing up yourself.

If you decide to use tactic 1, it will shut down the enemy ad carry, while not helping your team globally. This is efficient against champions such as Vayne, when it's more important to shut them down rather than help your team with global gold.

If you decide to follow tactic 2, you need to push the lane behind the dead turret, and then you, on general occasions, have 3 options.

1. If you have a strong early game skills, strong support perhaps, and a strong jungler, you **call your jungler, pink ward dragon and do it.** After this you see if the enemy bot lane is pushing, if it is, go depush it and go to tactic 2. or 3.

2. If number one is not doable(jungler is top, jungler is dead, dragon is dead, something else) you need to see what kind of a mid laner you are against. **If the enemy mid laner has non/not enough/low range wave clear, call your support and go push mid.** While doing this, you need to keep an eye on what your enemy in bot lane is doing. If he's not pushing the lane (freezing perhaps?) continue pushing the mid turret down. If he starts pushing towards your turret, you need to time your mid lane pushing, so you start moving towards bot lane IN TIME to clear the wave the enemy is pushing BEFORE it hits your turret and starts dying. **(This is the way you also keep up in CS in the mid game you were talking about)**

**3. You go to your own jungle, and clear the jungle monster camps.** After this, you see if your enemy bot laner is pushing towards your turret. If he is, you need to go back to lane, push the wave again, and then repeat, doing the camps or number 1. or 2.

All this is, ofcourse, general advice on how a game often goes. There will ofcourse be exceptions, many of them actually, but you will learn them in time. **Do remember, as long as you wont lose mid turret or baron for it, always go clear the bot lane wave before it pushes into your own turret and start dying. This way you will keep up with the cs count!**

**Lifesteal quints are really good on certain occasions.** It's not as much about the range of your adc, as it's about the comparison of yourself and your support against the enemy adc and support. If you have sustain support (sona) against engage support (leona) the lifesteal quints will not help you much, and it would probably be better to go full ad page or ad quints/apen marks and get that doran's blade start. This way, when that leona engages on you or your support, you will be doing more damage than you would otherwise do, and therefore helping you to win trades.

Again, it goes vice versa, if you think you're in danger of getting poked too much and maybe forced out of the lane/zoned, yes the LS quints are very good and they will help ensure you get more cs than normally, and regen your hp from the trades. Obviously the LS quints are also good on multiple shortengage lanes, such as taric or lulu, where constant regeneration is needed.

1363024332.0,43,self.summonerschool,1a3dnb,Something I worked out for practicing Orb Walking (must read for adc players),NaT3z,58,15,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1a3dnb/something_i_worked_out_for_practicing_orb_walking/,"I don't know about anyone else but with my minimum 207ms ping, I originally found that learning the perfect timing for orb walking was difficult, especially since I couldn't do it immediately after seeing the action (with 1/5 second delay, there really is no point orb walking if it's not muscle memory). So back to the tip, first I will explain orb walking (skip if you know). Orb walking is the interrupting of the autoattack animation and moving to maximise both movement and attack speed. This is generally done by using attack click (A click) then right clicking immediately after the autoattack has cast to interrupt the animation. If you want to attack someone chasing (generally the closest one), simply A-Clicking the ground will cause the autoattack to cast and attack the nearest enemy.

The tip:

BUY DRAVEN. I don't know if many people have shared or agree with this, but it helped me hugely. To explain. Everyone must know what Draven's Q does by now, right? He throws an axe with his autoattack that deals more damage and seemingly randomly appears somewhere that you need to catch it. What I worked out (and I don't think is very common knowledge) is that if you move your character in between throwing the autoattack and the attack hitting the target, the axe will move exactly in the direction that you move in this time.

As a result, by getting the pattern right, if you can catch the axes perfectly, you know that you are orbwalking because if you wait for the animation to cast, it hits the target and the axe moves randomly but if you move, it will go in the direction you moved. Draven has relatively high scaling attack speed per level so playing him gives you experience orb-walking with a range of attack speeds and if you build a phantom dancer, experience with even higher attack speeds.

ps. I really suck at simplifying and I will guess this is convoluted, but have to go do work so if anybody actually finds this useful but thinks it was hard to read, maybe make a tl;dr for me? Thanks guys.

**Enigma Item Changer - USE IT**

http://enigmablade.net/lol-item-changer/

It just hit the front page of /leagueoflegends, but the program is not that recent. It is a really easy to use program that let you change the recommended items. It is not cheat, it is not illegal and already was posted on LoL forums, some say that some rioters helped in the creation of it. Now with the S3, you can put TONS of items in the main page, so now you will be prepared with you items for every situation. No more navigating trough recipes to get that item. It is really improbable that you will configure it for every single champ, but please do this with our mains.
 
 
**You have a lot s masteires pages**

I just meet a friend in the 1400 ELO. I was stalking him and I was shocked that he only uses 4 masteires pages. Guys, you have 20 pages (I think) to use. We have 5 roles right now. But not only that. Create masteries for manaless mages (Kat, Vlad), creat for AP jungles, for tank jungler, for AD jungler. Then create for carrys when you are using ignite/exaust, and another one for carries when you don't are using ignite/exhaust. Create one page for that particular champion, if you feel that he needs some specific stats (like Singed, in my case). Just take a time and make a full use of your masteries.
 
 
**The Champions icons in the left are more useful than you think**

Have you aver being Taric so hard and when in a battle, you carry was being abused by minions and enemies, but the fuzz was too big that you just could not click to heal him? Just press Q in you carry icon in the left. Your champion will cast the spell on it, all automatic and all. With Shen, no more looking across the map to teleport. Just click on the icon and bang! Maybe if even counters Noc ult (not tested yet)?? Also, the green dot means if their ult is ready (they are now saying this on the tips, about time!).
  
 
**Use Smartcast**

Seriously. NO REASON TO NOT USE IT. ""But then how I will know the range of my spells? How I will calculate my Cho rapture? Go in options, interface, then turn Smartcast Indicators on. The spell will only be cast when you release the key, and while you keep it pressed, it shows the range and everything else. But please. Smartcast that shit.
 
 
**7:20 - 12:40**

Well, if you start with blue or red, they will spawn after 5 minutes. Since sometimes people are ""what I do now"" while jungling, create an schedule and be prepared to take (or give, or STEAL) the next buff at 7:20. And the next one about 5 minutes after, 12:40 (if you take 20 seconds do kill). With this in mind, you can jungle with more ""flowness"".

ALSO BUY AND USE WARDS. I NEED TO SAY THAT OTHERWISE ALL THE COMMENTS WILL BE ""DON'T FORGET TO WARD LOL"".

1337095629.0,45,self.summonerschool,tob68,Public Beta. What it is for &amp; what you should know about it (moved from r/LoL),LegendOfNeil,45,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tob68/public_beta_what_it_is_for_what_you_should_know/,"Dear Redditor,

Today I commented about the PBE (Public beta environment) to give advise to some guy about how useful the PBE is.
From the other comments I took out that a lot of redditors either don't know about the PBE or don't know what it is actually for.
The PBE, as the beta of LoL is getting more and more love from riot. Since a few patches riot started to upload early versions of the patches on the PBE to let the best bug hunters get to work, us!
So what? You probably ask yourself, but having a second client with attributes like the PBE is great for the lot of us.
What am I talking about? THIS:
1. You get 4000 rp and 10000 ip on your beta account, so you can pretty much buy anything you want. (Might take a while until you are granted the rp/ip)
2. You will be lvl 30 right when you start. This means you can build your runepages rightaway. (Might take a while until your account will be set to lvl 30)
3. Your RP/ip will regain 4000/10000 rp/ip every 2. week (someone stated it was every sunday, I#m not 100% sure about it, but according to this forum post (which is sadly german :/ link: http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=576613 [It links to the original post, which is in english]) it is every 2. week.

So what is the use of the PBE?
Well, you can try and buy every champ that you want to play, try new builds, try out new skins and more!
If riot keeps on updating the PBE you will even be able to try out the newest champ which will come out for 1rp so EVERYONE can buy and test him.
Unfortunately, if you play on Eu-W and North east prolly too regularly you will have to live with a ping that is over 100. I don't know if users from NA will have a high ping too as I live in europe.

Of course riot wants you to do something to. You should keep your eyes out for bugs, glitches and more so these bugs won't occur in the actual patch.

I hope you learned something new and useful.
Have a nice day.

Edit: I forgot the most important thing ._.
Register link: https://pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index
Download link: http://pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload
This is a second client which is free from the original one.

Edit2:

    Am I a good fit for PBE? PBE is not a place for serious competition or a place to try out new champions. It is a test environment where &gt;our players can help report bugs and give us feedback on changes we are implementing before it goes on the &gt;regular servers. We are looking for patient players with strong attention to detail to help us out.

I found this in the original post. I have to disagree with this strongly (event though it comes from a red).
It clearly says it is not a place to try out new champions, but still you have to try every champ in order to find out if their was a change to them.
Finding bugs requires people to try new things (new item builds just to see if the champion is bugged with a certain item [ I kinda remember GA not working on champs like yorick, karthus, etc.]).
I implemented this just in case someone gets cocky and actually reads the red post :))

1325097440.0,48,self.summonerschool,ntufx,"Basic ""Rules of Thumb"" for beginners.",KaOticKay,62,14,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/ntufx/basic_rules_of_thumb_for_beginners/,"* 1: Farming the minions (aka cs'ing):

While it is VERY nice getting those kills during early/mid game.. it is **not** as important as farming. If you have the opportunity to kill an enemy (say thanks to a gank from another lane/jungler) then by all means take it.. but never assume you need to continue killing the enemy. Eventually those kills will give you less and less gold, while the minions will not. You could be 22/0 by the end of the game with 40cs and STILL LOSE thanks to their carry being 2/12 with 200+ cs. **kills on enemies is not as important as killing creeps. ** (I've seen this far too much.. even still with people who are lvl 30's)

  - That being said I need to add the following as well:
Let your minions attack their minions and when you see one super low, hit it for the last hit. If you get it before your minions do then you'll get gold. After a bit of doing this you'll see what I mean by it's very important to last hit. Also PLEASE never stand still. Move constantly around the back side of your minions til you see one low enough then go in for the last hit. There's certain champions in the game who rely mainly on their skill shots.. if you're moving around it is harder for them to hit you with them. This is also beneficial if the champion is mana dependent and keeps missing you with his/her skill shots. After awhile of attempting to hit you they will run out of mana and have to go back to base to replenish it. This gives you the advantage because they miss cs and xp while you keep racking up the cs and xp. 


                                                 Tips on last hitting:

* Auto attack a caster minion and melee minion and take a mental note of how much damage you do (makes it easier to get used to last hitting especially if you are just starting out or you are switching between roles)

* Attack animation cancelling: practice attacking and then immediately clicking away so your character doesn't use the full animation but still attacks. Very important when playing AD carry since they mainly kite their opponents, and it makes it easier to attack while chasing them.

* [AD/SOLO TOP] Using the brush: It is also very beneficial to take advantage of the brush while last hitting. Stay in the brush, and when you see a minion is low walk out, last hit, and go back in the brush. It is good practice as you can also harass your opponent and walk back in the brush without aggro - ing minions. Don't do this if you are vs ing someone who takes advantage of walls.

* Its really good to practice last hitting in a custom game.


---- This is a little more advanced but it is definitely something worth practicing. If you want to get better at the game this is definitely one way to do so. xzephy is a genius! Thank you for this suggestion.

* Also, let me add that if you do not know what ""aggro - ing minions"" means.. It basically means having the enemy minions focus you down .. the main way this happens is if you attack a champion by a huge wave of their minions. The minions will stop attacking your minions and start attacking you.

* OP also said, ""Don't do this if you are vs ing someone who takes advantage of walls"".. If you're confused on what this means I believe he was referring to other champions that can use walls, turrets, etc as a way to harm you. Two champions I can think of at the top of my head that do this are Vayne and Poppy. Both of these champions can smash you into a wall and stun you.

**________________________________________________**

* 2: **WARDING** This is a HUGE one.

Through the whole game it is **very** important to ward. (You can find wards in the Consumables tab in the shop). Knowing where your enemy is at all times gives your team a huge advantage. It will stop your team from randomly ""face checking"" a bush only to find all of the enemy team waiting there... What a lot of people need to realize is *ONE* simple mistake can throw the game for the entire team. Buy wards as often as possible and learn the best placement of these wards to benefit your team. (I learned it from watching a bunch of live streams on: clgaming.net, solomid.net, own3d.tv) But please keep in mind that if you buy far too many wards you will not be able to buy the items you need for your champ to be beneficial for your team. It takes time but you'll learn to estimate how much you're able to spend on wards. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ARUsH.jpg) is a great picture of places to put wards that will benefit your team. (Thank you JokukI!!!!)

- Side note:

The *green* wards are just for the basic vision. They last for 3 minutes once placed. The enemy will not know they're there (unless you place them down right in front of their face) and you'll have vision on them trying to gank you. 

The *pink* wards are a bit more expensive but the reason behind this is because they give you vision of **invisible champs/objects.** (Such as: Twitch, Evelyn, Shaco [ or his jack in the boxes] , Teemo [or his mushrooms], etc) Just as the green wards these only last 3 minutes AND they can give you vision of an enemy team wards if you place them by or near their wards. This gives you the advantage because you can kill their ward, leaving them with no vision of that area til they lay a new one down. Which, by then your whole team could be waiting in a bush and kill them while they are trying to lay down the ward. 

**________________________________________________**

* 3: Know your enemy

I suggest reading up on all the champions in the game before you jump head first into it. There is a lot and yes I do understand that this can take some time and a lot of patience.. but it will benefit you in the long run. The best example I can give in this type of situation is if you have to go mid against a champion with a lot of cc (crowd control: stuns, taunts, fears, etc) and you have a champion with little to no cc. Changes are you're going to fail that lane. You also need to know their range compared to yours. ""Would it be safe for me to run out there and hit this minion, or should I just let them push to my tower and farm off of my tower?"" 

The best champion example I can give of this type of situation is if the enemy is Xerath and you're playing AP Sion. While Sion's shield can be good, Xerath would be able to take it down with his range and most likely not be hit when the shield explodes. Sion does have a stun but to use it you'd have to get fairly close to Xerath, while Xerath can increase his range by simply hitting W and spamming his abilities. Also, Sion has 1 stun while Xerath has a few... Xerath can either hit you with his E then his Q and you're stunned.. or he can simple W (increase his range), Q, and nail you with his 3 ulti's stunning you for some time. I am not saying that Xerath v Sion is a bad idea but I am saying that a good Xerath would win the lane hands down. 

**________________________________________________**

* 4. Buffs, Dragon and Baron control

What many newer people do not realize is the importance of buffs and Baron/dragon control. In each side of the jungle there's a [Blue Buff](http://i21.servimg.com/u/f21/16/41/48/26/blue_b10.jpg) and [Red Buff](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnEFiuLsbR_12SZUIsXWMftyxafgCC8Zd2IMMLT2oJdFlEuAzRnkMP9HYqeA) as well as [Wraiths - Do not give you a buff](http://i46.tinypic.com/1zn4xlw.png), [Wolves](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSAoy9U-rJjyKovaRcgWgm9Yc4Mt9-Sf4HLJtnS6Ms7K02QRhdXwPdP69FX1w), and [Gollums](http://images.mmosite.com/feature/news/2008_12_11/leagueoflegends/screenshot/golem3.jpg). 

[Dragon](http://i48.tinypic.com/n4wiol.jpg) is very important early to mid game. Dragon spawns 2 minutes 30 seconds into the game and if killed by either of the teams each player on said team will receive 190g. This is actually very important to control if the enemy team is already ahead of you in kills and farming. His death timer is 6 minutes. So for instance, if your team takes dragon at 10 minutes 15 seconds into the game.. He will respawn again for you to kill again at 16 minutes 15 seconds. 

[Baron Nashor](http://media.mahalo.com/upload/5/5c/fac8e64c4d087efb8912e1c900da7253_20110212.JPEG) is, in my opinion, the most important creep in the game. He spawns 15 minutes into the game.. If taken he will not respawn for another **7 minutes.** Baron gives the team who killed him a ""super buff."" This buff increases their damage and even heals them in small amounts over a very short period. It also disappears within 4 to 4:48 minutes after killed (depending on if you have a point in a mastery known as ""Runic Affinity"") [Here](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Exalted_with_Baron_Nashor) is a website if you'd like to read more on Baron Nashor and what he has to offer.  (Thank you Drag0n9000 and Mcluvy!!)


Blue buff is mainly used on AP casters.. however it can be used on anyone. Blue buff is ment to keep the mana up on the champion who has it. If the champion does not use mana then they get a really good cool down reduction.. What this mean is their ability timers are lessened. So if their ability before blue buff had a 4 second cool down.. it may now have a 2 second cool down. 

Red buff adds a little extra damage to the person who has it on and if it's on a ranged champion it adds a slow. This is actually very useful on an AD Carry (such as Vayne, Caitlyn, Corki, etc)

Now if any of this was confusing please let me simplify it for you:

* Blue and red buff respawn in **5 minutes** after they are killed.

     * Buff duration is 2 minutes 30 seconds *without* the Runic Affinity mastery.. 3 minutes with it.
                                                  (Thank you ishake_well!!!)
 
* Wraiths respawn every **50 seconds** (Thank you valete1510!!)

* Wolves and Gollums respawn every **1 minute.**

* Dragon respawns **6 minutes** after he is killed.

* Baron respawns **7 minutes** after he is killed.

Being that the ones reading this are lower levels, you will notice that not many people know or even care about the buffs, dragon or Baron. They assume the name of the game is to kill lots and hope to god you can plow your way to their base.. which isn't the case. If you can last hit properly and control the buffs, dragon and Baron you'll be amazed at how strong your team gets and how fast the game could end. 

Us ""seasoned players"" tend to pink ward Baron and Dragon. This gives us the ability to clear any wards the enemy team may have by them. Because honestly, you just never know if you're facing a pro's ""smurf"" account... this is still a really good idea even if you're new. Also, learning to keep the timers on these will be soooo beneficial. You do not want the enemy team getting buffs, even their own. So if your team is controlling the map it's a good idea to ward their buffs.. if an enemy goes to try to get the buff you and a few members of your team can go there to kill them and take the buff.. then you will know when it'll respawn.. so you can ward it once again before it spawns and kill them again if they go for it.

**When to do Baron/Dragon:**

Consider the following:

* a. How strong are we/how fast can we finish it/how strong is our jungler
* b. Did they ward it? (You can still do drag even if they did, but be prepared or pink it and destroy their ward.)
* c. Can they beat us in a 5v5?
* d. Are they in/out of position? (EX. the enemy teams jungler is top lane and your jungler is bottom, or if their ap mid or bottom lane blue pilled/recalled/b'd - this all means the same thing)
* e. Do we have a TP top and they don't? (TP is a shortened version of the summoner spell [teleport](http://cdn1.mobafire.com/images/summoner-spell/teleport.png)
    
**Tip:** You also generally want to pull the dragon out (hit it and walk back a bit) esp. if your team is the top half of SR (Summoners Rift) to avoid steals and to put your team in a better position. You can easily get caught in that crater thingy.

This is really good advice, but again a little advanced. However, I added this in here because it is something worth practicing on! I am trying not to dumb this post down for the new players.. but at the same time I don't want too much in here to where you're simply confused. If you remember this while in game, by all means try it!!! It is definitely something you need to learn. (Thanks again xzephy!!)


**________________________________________________**

* 5. Building correctly for the type of champion you are playing.. very important!

Being new it's hard to tell which item is good for who. So most of the time you either end up buying something completely random or you go with the recommended items. The recommended items aren't terrible.. but they're just the basic items for that champion. It's good to read up on the items and what they do. There's tons of items in the shop that counter certain champions and even builds. Knowing these items and what they do will give you a huge advantage over the enemy team. 

* For instance, if the enemy team seems to be building magic resist and you're playing an AP carry.. buy a [Void Staff](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Void_Staff). The void staff counters their magic resist so you can do more damage then you were before. Or if you're playing an AD carry and the enemy team seems to have a lot of armor, buy a [Last Whisper](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Whisper).

* Some good websites to look up the ""basic"" builds (most of the time better then the recommended) are: [solomid.net](http://solomid.net/guides.php) or [clgaming.net](http://clgaming.net/guides), [Leaguecraft.com](http://leaguecraft.com/strategies/guides), [Mobafire.com](http://www.mobafire.com/) (Thanks TangerineX!!!) . If anyone knows any better websites please feel free to add them in here and I will edit this post! Thanks!

**________________________________________________**

* 6. Never limit yourself on who you play!

When I first started I was playing Ashe. I can't tell you how long it took me to get enough guts to change from Ashe to a new champion. That new champion happened to be Akali.. took me months to get brave enough to turn my back on her. In the long run, this really hurt me. Limiting yourself to one champion or one style (AD, AP, etc) isn't very beneficial to you. While you're leveling up you should be experimenting with new champions and trying new things. So by the time you're level 30 you're not scared to enter into Ranked. Knowing more then one role will already put you ahead of the elo you start out at; skill wise. Practice and practice each role as much as possible. I do understand that is very hard to get enough IP for all the champions, I myself (after a year) am still missing 26 champions. Now this might not seem like a lot but I have a friend of mine to thank for that.. If not for him buying me enough RP to buy a champion bundle I would still be farther behind. Any way, try your best to know at least 3 champions for each role. Once you get into Ranked you never know if your limited champions you're good at will be banned. If they are, then you just basically left your team in a 4v5 team fight because you'll be playing someone you do not know or have limited knowledge of. 

(Thank you khjester for suggesting me to add this to this post!!!)

**________________________________________________**

* 7. Never be negative!!!!!

This is something I can not express to you enough. When you first start you have limited knowledge of the game so you're calm and collected. Just trying to learn and climb your way up that ladder. Once you start to learn more you begin to analyze everyone. This can be awesome, in a way, but only for you. If you know someone did something terribly wrong then you know that you are up there in skill level to where you know not to do it and you most likely won't. If you want to help them.. by all means help them. But do **not** criticize them. Negativity in a game more then often leads to a loss. Yelling or cussing at a team mate not only makes them play even worse it also puts tension within your team.. and as a team over all will be a terrible experience for all of you. Not to mention there's a possibility your team would've gotten so sick of you that they will report you after game; which believe it or not **can** lead into a ban.

It is perfectly fine to say something in the lines of, ""Mid lane.. Perhaps you should ward here *ping the bush* so you know if you're about to get ganked again."" It was nicely said as a tip to help them.. so more then not you'll find that they will take this advice and play better.

It is not ok to say something in the lines of, ""OMFG NOOB F***ING MID! WE LOSE THANKS TO THEM NOT WARDING!! GGGGG!!"" This causes far too much tension between you and the person you were talking about. Most of the time it causes you two to argue .. all along your team sitting there wanting you to just stfu and play the game. 

**________________________________________________**

* 8: Map Awareness!!!! (Thanks xzephy!!)

This is actually something that will take some time to get used to, even though it seems to be the easiest aspect in the game. Having good map awareness is important!!! 

**ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS** glance down at your [mini map](http://hidesquadron.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/minimap.jpg). Keep in mind that looking at your mini map during team fights is a really bad idea bad idea. lol  As Sol-Surviv-ar said, if you glance down at your mini map maybe after you get a cs or 2 then back to your lane, knowing your safe, you can continue to cs.If you look at that picture you will notice that there's green and red circles. On the mini map the *enemies* will be in red. Throughout the entire game it's definitely beneficial to keep glancing over at your map and counting those red circles. Do you count 2? Oh, that means that 3 are mia. So is it really safe to be where your standing .. or do you think it's best to step back til those circles appear back on your map? 

Another way to have excellent map awareness is by **warding.** I have already explained this in the warding section though. 

Some champions, such as Caitlyn and Nidalee, have traps that you can lay down to use as a temporary ward if you didn't have enough gold to buy one or your ward just ran out. If an enemy steps on these traps it will give you vision on the enemy for a *very short period.* (Caitlyn's traps even stun for a very short duration - this should give you some time to run back to safety). Let me add to never depend on these types of skills over wards. It is never a guarantee the enemy will step on one of the traps to reveal them. So, please please please do not hold back on the wards if you need them.

**________________________________________________**

**My own words/thoughts**

I want to apologize for how incredibly long this thread is. I wanted to keep it simple and basically just go over the do's and dont's.. but slowly it's turned into this massive thing that I hope you've just taken the time to read. I do understand that all of this can be overwhelming and I apologize. Take your time to read through this... if you have to.. come back and read it again. If you have any questions you can either post them in here for me and others to respond or you can simple IM me and ask (if you want it to be a more private Q&amp;A). 

There is sooo much to this game that I honestly do not know if you could find someone who wouldn't take a long time to explain it all. It's all achieved and learned through *practice.* It is **OKAY** to forget something when you're new. Do not beat yourself up for it. Just learn from it.

One way to analyze and criticize yourself is by downloading [lolrecorder](http://www.leaguereplays.com/). If you have this running during your games it will record them. After your game, if you want to see where you went wrong or what you could've done better.. simply open the recording of that game and watch. Watch yourself.. you'll be shocked at how many mistakes you find you did. The more you do this.. the better you will get..

I propose to you... **a challenge!**... kinda!

I want to do some premade draft normals with some people in this subreddit.  The idea is to play and to *learn*, not necessarily to *win*.  In ranked, there is so much damn pressure to *win* that it seems that we (or at least for myself) aren't focused on our mistakes, not focused on the new hotness in our roles, or are too afraid to push the boundaries of our potential.

The idea is to get five people together to actually sit down and **focus** on being **better**, not on winning.  I wanted to get five people who wanted to learn their ""main"" role better.  With buffs and nerfs coming so fast, it's hard to keep up sometimes with things that are becoming increasingly strong, or are strong but difficult to play... or that we don't play enough matches to know all the counter picks and all the strategies we need to win lanes.

&gt; So, wanna participate?  I mentioned my elo not to deter you, because this is open to everyone, bronze or silver or gold or even higher than that if you want to join in.  I don't care who joins me, I just want to be able to focus on getting better at what *I* do, and if I can help other people in the process... what a bonus!

To participate, here are the rules:

* You **must** download the [LoL Replay client.](http://www.leaguereplays.com/download/)  After the games, you have to open up your replay and see what your mistakes are or how are you going to get better?

* You must play a ""viable"" champion for your role.  ADC Ahri might be fun, but probably not the best option for ranked play, where you will probably get reported for such a thing.  The idea is to get better for ranked!

* You must not rage!  We will probably lose.. a lot..  Losing is part of the game and even pros lose.  Mistakes happen!  The less mistakes you do, the higher you will be on the ladder!  If you rage even once (**JUST ONCE**) and we are done with you.

* As for the not so harsh restrictions, you should play the same champion for each game we play.  The idea is to know your champion inside and out, counter picked or not.  You need to know how to deal with your counter pick, because there is a right way to do it.  Hope isn't lost!

* You should also... have fun?  If you don't think this will be fun, then don't do it :)  I would love to have you guys, but if your not into it, then that's ok!

Are you guys up to it?  I personally play mid but I need a lot of help in other roles as well!  I will keep a list of people and their roles so we can organize once a week and do a few games each week and if there is enough interest, we can even do team battles (but that's not the focus, lol).

That's the challenge!  Leave your summoner name and we will organize soon!  Thanks for reading!  :)

(also, if anyone knows how to do the fancy formatting, let me know!  I want to make some nice posts each week to congratulate the participants for doing well and I don't want it to look bad like this one)

EDIT: Holy this exploded... I didn't think that would happen, LOL.  Let me try to get an organization up.. Let me try to figure this out :P

It's frustrating when people take jungle camps and then get mad at you if you kill some creeps. I'm not one for gank tax or whatever people say, but when I jungle I typically like to farm. It's one thing if it's late game, but if it's early game you shouldn't be taking the jungle camps.

You shouldn't expect ganks when you push your lane beyond the mid point. I don't get people complaining about this as much, but it's worth mentioning. I won't gank unless the waves are in the middle or you are pushed back. Also keep in mind that junglers can't be everywhere at once. Some people will push their lane and get ganked then bitch at me when I don't magically appear. If I see a gank coming I'll try and come to help but if you push your lane my attention will be else where. 

Lastly people need to stop tower diving when I come gank. Puts me in the awkward position of either abandoning my team mate or risk giving up more kills.

1371468790.0,41,self.summonerschool,1gid77,"How i play Kayle, the top lane bully.",chrisal1,53,12,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gid77/how_i_play_kayle_the_top_lane_bully/,"For Runes, Masteries and Items. http://www.lolking.net/guides/preview/154500

Even though Kayle can be played differently and built AD or more AP oriented, this guide focuses on my playstyle.

First of all to play Kayle you need to have a specific mentality. You need to clear your mind, and stop respecting your opponent too much, always be aggressive and DO NOT HAVE RESPECT. You are there to literally dump on him.

Laning Phase - 
What you want to do untill you hit lvl 2 is auto atk with melee atks if possible, if he's aggressive, atk back with E while moving back and ward immediately after you have pushed the wave. Get some health back with either pot or flesk and get back to harassing. When you get to lvl 2 you start your annoyance, every time he reaches for a creep or gets close. This is a different approach from the usual ""auto atk in melee form so you don't push your lane""

- How to properly harass with Kayle - 
*The most efficient way to harass with Kayle is activating E, auto attacking once, using Q and finally auto attacking again. This is by far the most frequent combo i use and it deals a lot of dmg. After that you go for as many auto attacks you can get without losing cs. It's not always possible to land a E auto atk before Q because they tend to back fast after you activate E. With time you will eventually know when to use this combo.
*The second combo is straight up starting with Q, E activation and auto atk.

With Kayle you will most likely be the one commanding the lane early on so you need to keep in mind a few things.

- What to do when you are commanding the lane - 
*Ward and check the map frequently, Kayle is prone to ganks due to her squishiness early on and lack of gap closing/opening abilities. You will be taking a lot of pressure off your other lanes by keeping their jungler busy, they should be happy.
*All-ing in with Ignite as early as lvl 2. The dmg potential with Ignite, E, Q, E is huge. This will teach your opponent who's the boss of the lane and you will have easier time laning.
*Be aggressive, harass whenever possible, whenever you think it's reasonable and he can't trade back, whenever he goes for that canion minion whenever your minions are at his tower. Bully him 24/7.
*Freezing and Zoning. The minion waves after you have pushed will eventually push back to your side, freeze it and then try to zone him/her. You can stay in the bushes and throw combos (Q,E / E,Q,E / W,Q,E ) every time he comes close.
*If your enemy is low ask your jungler for a gank from behind his tower and dive him, Kayle is exceptionally good at diving  
Optional - Pink ward and act as if your jungler is ganking, this requires 1 additional normal ward so you cover two possible ganking paths since you will be overextending a lot. Additionally you can stay in the pink warded bush and surprise him if he face checks to ward, or roam.
This is how you play Kayle as a Bully.

Advanced Kayle mechanics - engaging/disengaging.
Some champions are hard to bully and in a lot of situation you will find your engaging and disengaging abilities lackluster, this is due to a poor use of W. To get the maximum use of W you need to read your opponent and act accordingly. For example in a situation where your opponent is backing you want to use W to engage and combo, while in a situation where you opponent is in position to trade back you E,Q,E and W back so he can't follow up thus making you take minimal dmg.
But these are two simple situations right?
Now put that knowledge in situations against certain champions, would you use W before or after Jayce's knock-back? Exactly, if you used W before his knock-back most of the speed buff would be gone, leaving you unable to reach him. If you use W just after his knock-back you will reach him and be able to harass him.
You want more examples?
When Jax activates stun and tries to jump you, W right away, it's close but it's definitely possible.
Malphite slows and steals your speed, but he can't steal the 18/21/24/27/30% you just acquired, right? He can't reach you.
Singed uses slow to catch you, W no problem. You outrun him.
Nidalee tries to reach you with a jump, W away.
With the proper engages and disengages you will deal significantly more Dmg. The estabilished combos are E,Q,E,W - W,Q,E - Q,E,W - W,Q,E

After the end of the early game you should be constantly pushing, warding and trying to 1v1 you opponent top. Mid game is the strongest phase of the game for Kayle. Then the team fights start.

In team fights - 
Kayle is decent at team fighting. She possesses a slow, utility, DPS and a game turning invulnerability spell.
I find my self initiating a lot of times because i have the ability to Q in and W out fast, but generally you want your tank, bruiser to initiate. What you want to do at first is speeding up your initiator.
In a team fight you need to be constantly dealing dmg and supporting your team-mates with heals and/or Ulti.
In team fights you always start with Q and follow up with E, shredding your opponents resistances. Kayle requires good positioning  because you want to be in range and keep auto attacking, shredding resistances and dealing really high DPS. It's important to focus the same target your Ad Carry is focusing, or what most of your team-mates are focusing. 
Always heal whenever is up, ideally a target that is low, is getting chased or is chasing.

Who and when do i ult? -
This is the question no Kayle player or anyone has answered with certainty. It's situational, it depends on your opponents level of skill and it requires luck. With time you will get the feeling. I personally have done ults to absorb dmg, i have succeeded, failed a lot, i have flashed and done late ults saving a guy from dying to ignite or other bleeds/poison spells, i also have done late ults that cost us the team fight. I believe now i have mastered this mechanic and i present you how and when i use R.

In 1v1's - 
1st use, when you opponent blows his burst, generally good when Kha Zix jumps, Zed ult's, Lux combos you, etc
2nd use, after Guinsoo's passive activates, Guinsoo's activates after you get below 50% health, you want to ulti at that moment because you have the strongest Kayle you can get, Guinsoo's gives you extra 20% atk speed, 10% lifesteal and 10% spell vamp
3rd use, when you are low, this is so you ""bait"" your opponent into thinking that he can kill you but you R and kill him instead, many people fall for this even in high level play

In team fights -
1st use, when a team-mate gets caught and, i repeat, and it doesn't hurt your teams chances to win a fight, for example if your support gets hooked in a team fight and is certain death do not ulti him. This requires a immediate use of your Ulti. 
2nd use, ulting your self, mostly do this mid game because you will most likely be the biggest dmg dealer in that period, your Ad Carry is not farmed yet. This requires ulting the moment they swap the focus on you or you got caught in the front line, generally you are not a priority target
3rd use, ulti the Ad Carry, people will be jumping on your Ad Carry 24/7 you want to keep him safe and make your opponents waste cooldowns on him. The ulti here is very important and situational intensive, mostly go when your Ad Carry get's CC'd and the enemies are ready to jump on him.
4th use, your initiator, this is mostly good when he's tower diving, people tend to focus the person that is getting hit by tower and blow everything on him making your ulti absorb thousands of dmg. This is the easiest of all, i personally prefer to ulti around mid health.



If you apply the knowledge given here you will be able to make use of Kayles kit at high percentage.

1367602460.0,43,self.summonerschool,1dmpa8,[Runes FAQ] For all your rune-ing questions!,FlaxxtotheMaxx,51,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1dmpa8/runes_faq_for_all_your_runeing_questions/,"Hello summoners!

This is the FAQ about runes and runes only! I will be throwing around some scary mathemagics, so back away if you're allergic [please I don't want to be sued ;_;] Thanks a bunchizzles for /u/rot1npiece for his help!

--------------------------
**Rune FAQ [Basic, by /u/rot1npiece]**

* **Why should I get runes?**

Runes give you an undeniable advantage in League of Legends. A full, tier 3 runepage gives you a ton of free stats [see advanced section for maths] at the beginning of the game; laning against a fully runed opponent when you have no runes will lose you the lane pretty much 99% of the time.

* **When should I get runes?**

Tier one runes are not a bad investment. They are extremely cheap and give good stats [about half of tier three runes]. Avoid tier two runes like the plague; they are overpriced and you'll replace them soon enough anyway. Once you hit level 20, you should start filling up your rune pages with tier three runes.

* **I have only two rune pages, are they enough?**

To be honest, not at all.  For a normal player (verses a pro player), you need at a minimum of three rune pages: One AP, one AD and one for Support.  After these three, you can (and should) add more pages based on your main role, based on your needs.

* **What should these three rune pages look like?**

[In game, reds are ""marks"", yellows are ""seals"", blues are ""glyphs"", and quints are ""quintessences"".]

* *AP*: Magic Pen or Hybrid Pen reds, Armor yellows, scaling AP blues, AP quints

* *AD*: AD reds, Armor yellows, MR blues, AD quints

* *Support*: Armor reds, Armor yellows, MR blues, Gold per 10 quints

These three pages cover 99% of all champions in the game.  There are some variations, but there are better things to use your IP on.

* **I see pros use different runes, why do you suggest these?**

Simply enough, these runes just cover the most champions in the game.  I suggest these because they fit more champs, and multiple pages can use the same runes (like the armor and mr runes).

One reason why pros use different runes are a regional thing.  Some players in EU (namely Gambit, former Moscow 5) use 8 AD, 1 Crit red and Life Steal quints.  Should you use these runes as an AD champion?  Of course you should!  They are absolutely the best set up by one of the best teams in the world!  The problem is... you can only use these as the ADC in the bottom lane.

The biggest thing that people can debate all day is the Hybrid Pen reds for an APC.  The reason I suggest these is that you sacrifice minor amounts of magic pen to gain about 7 armor pen.  The reason this is good is that you *will* auto attack in lane, and it will help that damage stick on your enemy.

--------------------
**Rune FAQ [Advanced]**

* **What runepages should I have beyond the basic three?**

If you already have the basic runepages listed above, here are some other, more advanced runepages:

* *AD with Lifesteal:* AD reds, Armor yellows, MR blues, Lifesteal quints

This is best used when starting a Doran's blade vs. a lane with some poke and sustain [Sona, Taric] and on a champion that can lifesteal safely [Caitlyn, Ezreal]. You will lose straight up trades, but it is much easier to sustain in lane.

* *Jungler:* Attack speed reds, Armor yellows, MR per level blues, Movespeed/AD/HP quints

Junglers have very flexible runes, but the general consensus is attack speed reds are generally the best choice for jungle clear. Movespeed quints may slow your clear down a little, but the ganking/chasing/running away power more than makes up for it. Flat HP quints are useful on junglers who get counter jungled easily; the extra HP can make it or break it when dueling or escaping from the opposing jungler.

* *Armor pen:* Armor pen reds, Armor yellows, MR/MR per level blues, Armor pen/AD quints

Armor penetration received a huge buff recently; it now applies after percent penetration [Ex: if your opponent has 100 armor and you have 9% armor penetration + flat 10 armor pen, you will deal damage as if they had 100 - 9% = 91 - 10 = 81 armor]. This rune set up is best on AD carries or top laners, however it will make last hitting more difficult without the flat damage.

* *Early game cheese:* 8 AD reds + 1 Critical chance red, Armor yellows, MR blues, AD/lifesteal/armor pen quints

This is all about the cheese. Player using this runepage reason that the extra AD red will not make a huge difference, but the critical chance red may help in completely dominating an exchange and snowball your lane.

* **How much IP will I be spending on runes and runepages?**

Here I will calculate the cost of all the runepages we outlined above. For runes that we gave more than one choice, I will go with the first one listed.

* *AP:* 12300 IP

* *AD:* 8610 IP

* *Support:* 7080 IP

* *AD with Lifesteal:* 11685 IP

* *Jungler:* 13530 IP

* *Armor pen:* 10455 IP

* *Early game cheese:* 8815 IP

* *5 additional rune pages:* 31500 IP or 2600 RP [7 pages]

* *Total [no overlapping]:* 37625 IP for runes + 31500 IP for pages = 69125 IP

* **How much gold in terms of stats do runes give me?**

Here I will calculate the the stats runes give you in terms of gold. All statistics are based off the lowest priced item in the game that gives said statistic. 

Basic item statistics [these stats are worth X amount of gold]: 

* 1 AD = 40 G [Long Sword]
* 1 AP = 21.75 G [Amplifying Tome]
* 1 Armor = 20 G [Cloth Armor]
* 1 Armor Pen = 133.7 G [Brutalizer]
* 1% Attack Speed = 33.3 G [Dagger]
* 1% Critical Chance = 50 G [Brawler's Gloves]
* 1 Gold per 10 = 140 G [Philosopher's Stone]
* 1 HP = 2.64 G [Ruby Crystal]
* 1% Lifesteal = 80 G [Vampiric Scepter]
* 1 Magic Pen =  73.3 G [Sorcerer's Shoes]
* 1 Magic Resist =  20 G [Null-Magic Mantle]

Value of runes in game [from those discussed in this post]:

REDS

* 9 AD reds: 8.55 AD = 342 G
* 9 Armor reds: 8.19 Armor = 163.8 G
* 9 Armor Penetration reds: 12 Ar.P = 1604.4 G
* 9 Attack Speed reds: 15% AS = 499.5 G
* 9 Critical Chance reds: 8.37 CC = 418.5 G
* 9 Magic Penetration reds: 7.8 Mag.P = 571.74 G

YELLOWS

* 9 Armor yellows: 13 Armor = 260 G

BLUES

* 9 AP blues: 10.71 AP = 232.94 G
* 9 Magic Resist blues: 12 MR = 240 G

QUINTESSENCES

* 3 AD quints: 6.75 AD = 270 G
* 3 AP quints: 15 AP = 326.25 G
* 3 Armor Pen quints: 7.8 Ar.P = 1042.86 G
* 3 Gold per 10 quints: 3 GP10 = 420 G
* 3 HP quints: 78 HP = 205.92 G
* 3 Lifesteal quints: 6% Lifesteal = 480 G


Value of a full runepage in game [order is red, yellows, blues, quints]:

* AD page [AD, Armor, MR, AD]: 1112 G
* AP page [Mpen, Armor, MR, AP]: 1397.99 G
* Support page [Armor, Armor, MR, GP10]: 1083.8 G
* Jungling page [Atk.spd, Armor, MR, AD]: 1269.5 G
* Armor pen page [Ar.P, Armor, MR, Ar.P]: 3147.26 G
* AD with Lifesteal page [AD, Armor, MR, Lifesteal]: 1322 G 
* Cheese page [1 Crit chance/8 AD, Armor, MR, AD]: 827.6 G

1362422185.0,43,self.summonerschool,19ngq8,I quit playing co-op and started playing only solo queue on my way to 30. Here is what I learned,zedbra,56,13,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19ngq8/i_quit_playing_coop_and_started_playing_only_solo/,"I thought I would share some thoughts on my transition from co-op to solo queue on my way to playing ranked games. I am on [NA - Iriog](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/23708847#history) and not very good, but I figured I would share my thoughts. 

History: Even though I love competitive multiplayer my anxiety playing against people gets the best of me and if I am not playing with people I know I usually don't play. I loved played OG Dota at lan parties and have played LoL off an on for almost 3 years. Because of this anxiety when I played LoL I only played against bots. With the release of the new ladder system I really wanted to play ranked.  

I stuck to co-op since the people in game were generally easy going or silent with very little flaming. I am in no way bashing the bot system, I think it is great for beginners, trying new tactics, and experimenting with champions. 

*My fears playing against people*

* Getting flamed by my own team
* The other team harassing through chat the whole time
* Losing
* Not playing well and losing games

I found out some of my friends played LoL and one night played 3 or 4 games with them. This is what I needed to break into playing against people and I will never co-op again. I felt I have learned a lot so I thought I should share some stuff I have learned

* All chat is disabled you don't see anything from the enemy team. You can imagine they are just bots
* You will play against different champions. My first game I was Trist against Draven and died a lot.
* People pretty much play whatever they want. So don't worry about following the meta. You should learn different roles because good team composition is always a good thing.
* Mute flamers, done and done.
* Don't be afraid of communicating. Think it is a good time to Baron? Do it. Want to push mid, chat and let others know. 
* Understand how champions abilities work in team fights, roaming, and laning. Landing a Alistar combo is freaking fantastic!
* Games are so much fun! Seriously a blast each game is different win or lose.

This has become a text wall, but I have been having so much playing I hope it inspires others to make a jump into regular queue!

TL;DR Stop playing bots and play against people. There are lessons to learn and fun to be had.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,default,True,t3_19ngq8,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19ngq8/i_quit_playing_coop_and_started_playing_only_solo/,
1361561050.0,45,self.summonerschool,191cgw,Case Study: Support Carry,Sixtox,52,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/191cgw/case_study_support_carry/,"People tend to ask a lot ""Can supports carry?"". And I must answer with a resounding ""YES!"", but not especially in the same way as you'd think. Sure, sometimes a support Lux will land a clutch double-shield over all 5 teammates as they are combo-AoE ulted, saving everyone's lives and turning an 0-4 trade into a 5-0 trade. But usually it's more subtle.

I present to you **""The Case of the Pink Ward That Never Was""** (A fair warning that it is a bit of a read, as it is the story of a game):

I was watching a 1k Elo game the other day, when Elo still existed. So level 30's, but not great ones.

The guy I was watching was supporting, and I was writing down pointers for him. There was a particular point where he bought Green wardx2, pot x2, when the better solution was a pink, green, pot x1 (and waiting a few more seconds for the few more gold necessary to make the purchase).

He was laning as Nunu (Partner MF) against Vayne/Leona. Everyone was even (Vayne just slightly ahead in items), at level 7-ish. A chain of events then happened that changed the course of the match.

Friendly Nunu was standing in the close lane brush, when a ward came in. This gives Leona vision for her Zenith Blade. Now, our plucky Nunu knew this, and so didn't stray close enough to the non-visible bush for Leona to grab him and make his day very bad. Nice work!

However, it still would have been significantly safer to pink ward that bush, if he had purchased a pink ward. That would give him vision control over that bush for a full 3 minutes, probably enough to get out of laning phase at that point, or at least long enough to afford another B for more wards.

Two effects would come from this:

- He would have vision for 3 minutes

- Leona wouldn't have vision for 3 minutes

Now, as it turns out, the hostile Vayne/Leona combination was pushing pretty hard, and managed to gain control of the forward bush, the one that Leona had warded... the one that Nunu had not pinked.

If Nunu had pinked the bush, then he would still have vision of the bush. Leona had no pink ward to counter-pink, nor really any need to. As is, she was sitting in the bush as happy as a clam.

And then, it happened.
Leona shot a Zenith blade out at MF, who didn't dodge it in time, because there was no vision from the bush to do so. (Were there the pink ward in the brush, that vision would be there, and we take the leap of logic that MF would have successfully dodged this with the extra lead time).

Leona on MF, with an R'ed Vayne hot on her tail, not good news. She dies quickly.

The Leona/Vayne pair is hard under turret, and Leona has just put up her W (bonus armor), and is at high health because MF died before she was able to put out much more damage. They continue on to Nunu. A condemn into the wall stuns him, and the two make short work of him as well.

Double kill to Vayne.

Leona and Vayne go back to base and heal up.

Vayne purchases a vamp scepter.

Fast forward 5 minutes. That pink ward (that I argue would have prevented the double kill) would have long since expired. And yet it is still having an impact on the game.

The friendlies choose to take a dragon. All fine and dandy until Vayne shows up and goes to work. It's a 4v4, with both junglers and both mids showing up to join the party. The friendly team does an admirable job of putting the hurt on Vayne, and she quickly gets low. She keeps attacking, tumbling, condemning as she can. She gains a double kill, and escapes with 34 life. Two for nothing trade in favor of the hostiles, with a standstill at dragon.

But wait, just a second. That double kill, because of the Pink Ward that Never Was, that gold was what Vayne spent on the vamp scepter. That vamp scepter was the reason she lived to tell the tale (10% life steal, and she did far more than 340 damage during the teamfight, so the life she ran away with was stolen life). [Because of the way the fight worked out, she might have harvested 1 kill without the vamp scepter, but would have definitely died. I read the trade as a 2-1 in favor of the friendlies rather than a 0-2 against, if she didn't have the vamp scepter, but this is somewhat speculation].

So now we have a Vayne that is 4 kills up because of The Pink Ward that Never Was. And a Vayne with 4 kills more than she should have is a force to be reckoned with.

Oh, the standard things happened in the next twenty minutes. People got caught out; people were out of position; people were farming lanes when they should be teamfighting; people failed to ward as much as they should; the team started raging at each other; it felt like they could never have won this game... and maybe they couldn't have.

But I tell you, if ""The Pink Ward That Never Was"" was actually placed, MF/Nunu never would have died bot. Vayne might not have even challenged the dragon fight. Vayne would not be up four kills, and might instead be down a dragon.

And that, my fellow friends of summoner school, is a significantly closer game than it might have been. I wish I could reset the game to that point and have the people play out from there, if that pink ward was in fact set, to see for sure if that really was the turning point in the game.

Either way, though, making a solid play as a support, like placing that pink ward, takes a blowout game and makes it closer. It takes a close game and tips it in your favor. Whatever is happening in the game, it shifts it more toward a possible win for your team. And in order to gain Elo, all you need to do is consistently shift the odds in your favor. Over time this leads to more wins -&gt; more Elo, and before you know it, you are a League of Legends rockstar.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Supports can carry their team. Just not in the way that other champions do.

1361296741.0,44,self.summonerschool,18tv3k,The free ELO guide to mid. How to play Twisted Fate correctly. ,dontsweattt,50,6,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18tv3k/the_free_elo_guide_to_mid_how_to_play_twisted/,"Hey guys I am making a quick guide on Twisted Fate for solo Q. Twisted Fate is an exceptional pusher and with global presence makes him a terror in the game. Here are my credentials http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/415639 

Skills:
[Q] Wild Cards. Always max first regardless of the situation. Your hardest hitting ability until you get lich bane and max Pick a Card [W]

[W] Pick a Card. I have seen people max this 2nd and last, personally I am going to say max it second. Try to use blue card in lane for easy last hitting and red to clear waves. It is very important to clear waves fast so the opponents mid cannot see if you are running top or bottom to gank

[E] Stacked Deck. Get at either level 2 or 3 and max last. Its is EXTREMELY important to auto attack opponents while your spells are on cooldown because of this spell. 

[R] Destiny. Allows you to teleport up to 5500 extra range. You can teleport to bot or top near Wolves/Banana bush. Keep this in mind when you are running to gank because you need a point in your head to think, ok this is where i can pop my ult and still get to lane. 

Skill order:
W,E,Q,Q,Q,R,Q,W,Q,W,R,W,W,E,E,R,E,E

(Get Q at level 2 if the opponent has already started to push the wave)

Build order:
There are two ways to early build Twisted Fate. 

Build 1: If you are able to get good ganks off build this way
- Boots x3 health bots
- Sheen, if you are having mana issues get a dorans ring
- Lich Bane
- Arm guard -&gt; Soc boots -&gt; hourglass
- Deathcap
- Void Staff
- Last item is up to you. Build defense if you need it such as warmogs or banshee vail. Want more damage you can get Twin Shadows for AP + MS

Build 2: Not/Cannot get ganks off efficiently 
- Boots x3 health pots
- 2 dorans rings
- Deathcap
- Armguard -&gt; Soc boots -&gt; Hourglass
- Lichbane 
- Void Staff
- Your choice of defensive or offensive item 

Play style:

I personally like to play passive early until I get wards. You can still harass with Stacked Deck[E] with Blue pick a card[W]. I say use blue pick a card because you do not want to get behind with your mana because level 6 ganks cost 250 mana ~ 50% of your mana pool [Ult, Pick a card, Wild cards]

Try to gank every time your ult is up. Push lane then gank. Try to tele in by your team, you can be more aggressive once you get hourglass.

Team fights:

In team fights you do one of two things. 
1.First either stun someone out of position
2.CC the enemy front line and poke with Q and autos from E. 

The reason you want to do these two things is because TF is going to be squishy no matter what. If you get too aggressive and move to close to the fight you are going to be blown up, even with hourglass they can kill you with 1 CC and you might not be able to hourglass. Kill whoever is close to you and then move towards the carry. Or if u find someone out of position stun them then move back and allow your team to come and help you. If you are getting focused in the backline try to use hourglass in the middle of the fight. you can probably stun and run away then they will change targets, if not keep kiting till who ever is on you is dead.

If you have any questions let me know, I will checking in on this post from time to time.

I was playing Karthus mid and morale was low. The usual banter of blame was being thrown around from bot lane to top lane to jungler (and even some gloating from the opposing team). At this point we had a few options:


1) Quit and feed

2) Try to survive.

At this point I told my team we can win, we can still win if we play to late game and stall as long as possible. More banter and blame occurred but we began trading kills for kills (instead of just dying).  At around the 40 minute mark we had stalled long enough to attempt a comeback; the opposing team hadn't taken any inhib towers. At that point, we began barely coming ahead in team fights; compounding into larger margin of wins in later team fights. At the end of the 1 hour match the opposing team, who was gloating and talking trash towards us early in the match, were flipped in reverse at their own teammates for ""throwing"".



So how did we win? For one, late game Karthus. But, I think the main reason we won was because my team barely kept its head on straight. Never give up and never give your teammates a reason to quit or stop trying; motivate them to keep going and you may just pull out a win you thought was a for sure loss. 


Remember, if you surrender you will win 0% of the time. If you decide to play, and even if you only have a 1% chance of winning, you increase your chances by infinity vs that surrender!

1359959870.0,43,self.summonerschool,17uskf,A call to arams: Why playing different game modes can give you a better understanding of Summoner's rift.,fomorian,56,13,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/17uskf/a_call_to_arams_why_playing_different_game_modes/,"When newer players talk about the game, they invariably talk about feeling helpless in teamfights. They may spam spells at targets that are suboptimal, tunnel vision ona target they're never going to kill, or get caught badly out of position. This is largely due to inexperience with teamfighting, and the pressure put on you in the knowledge that any one teamfight can turn a game swiftly on its head, undoing the work that went into gaining a lead in the 40 minute game. 

This is partially due to the structure or Summoner's rift. Every single SR game starts with the laning phase, so over time you get a degree of familiarity with it. However, it's not guaranteed that you'll be put into a 5v5 teamfight scenario every single game. Sometimes teams will never group up, get caught, and the game will be over before any real fight occurs. This can lead to people having good experience with laning phase, but not so good experience with teamfighting. 

The best way to alleviate this uncertainty is with familiarity, and that's where ARAM and dominion comes in. ARAM and dominion are teamfight centric game modes, with team fights starting in minute one and not ending til the game ends (unless you happen to be the team's designated solo bot in dominion in which case you're an antisocial person who likes to play malzahar or yorick anyways). You can work on team coordination, get to practice doing the perfect combo, and if you happen to pick the wrong target for your combo you'll have the chance to fix that mistake in the next teamfight. 

Another thing it helps you with is learning how to play as part of different team comps. ARAM and dominion team comps are radically different from SR comps, so teamfights will vary a lot more. If you have a lot more beefy melee dudes, you might look to hard engage rather than poke from range. You will learn to play to your team's strengths, and judge what needs to be done in numerous different situations, rather than always having the cookie cutter answer of ""focus the carries.""

Apart from helping you learn how to teamfight, switching game modes also gives an insight into how the game changes when the rules are changed subtly. Players only ever pick heal/barrier in ARAM, and revive is considered the flash of high elo dominion: every player must have it. Why? What changed about these maps that made these particular summoner spells popular, and what's stopping them from being the dominant strategy on SR? You get increased mana regen based on missing mana on the crystal scar. Manaless champions are therefore nerfed as a result of not benefiting from this. On ARAM, you aren't allowed to go back to heal, making health and mana regen items a lot stronger than on SR. These little changes force you to ask questions and get a deeper knowledge of the game as whole. 

Just one thing though: Never write off a ""bad"" aram team comp at champion select. First of all, you don't know all the facts. You don't know your teammates' skill, nor the enemy team's skill. Your teammates could have ""shitty"" aram champions like udyr and shyvana (who by the way are actually not that shitty at all), but if they're plat level players or hotshot smurfs they could still make it work. Make no assumptions before the game, and just observe the game with an open mind.

TL;DR This is a short little rant about how ARAM's build teamfight confidence for players unaccustomed to teamfighting because of SR's mandatory laning phase, and how seeing the rift from different eyes can help explain why certain things are the way they are.

Information overload problems, not specific/organized enough, not enough useful information, not enough maintenance, lots of fluff, and no real accountability.**

Hey,

I was about to list myself in the teacher list and it is insanely daunting to even start to attempt. I was curious if there is a way to create a new list that includes different (more precise) criteria for organization.

It's awesome that we have so many willing to help, but how many are currently active, qualified to teach a 1300 player, etc? There is something missing.

So, I move that we:

* Find out if there is a way to list the current online status of teachers somehow. (I know this is possible with bots, dunno if there is another method.)

* Define the trainers by the Elo/skill level they are willing to teach. IE: Why would a 2k waste their time teaching a 400 Elo player? I mean, not to be harsh with the words ""waste time"" but honestly they too low to understand some of the small tweaks or even benefit. You don't want players listing their own Elo without this system because there would be scrambles to learn from that one pro 2354 player. Have players list their own Elo, and the Elo/Skill level they are willing to teach. I'm 1650 and I'm willing to teach 1k Elo + or level 25 and up with 75+ normal wins. Get me?

* I really like the idea of a rating system, but it seems like it could snowball out of control. One person on there has 10 points, why would people bother trying to work with anyone else? I think a review system would be much more intuitive, stressing honesty and asking questions like

Do you feel all of your time was used efficiently? Do you feel more confident in your play now, or less? Is this a good or bad thing? Rate your overall experience on a scale of Flawless (8) to Left Something Desired (1) or even Negative (-1).

* I think general knowledge shouldn't exist as a category for training. Training should consist of 2 roles for a teacher, max - limited to Bot, Top, Mid, Jungle, Off Meta. Reason for no separation between support and carry? It can be just as beneficial in the duo lane to learn from the person you depend on, what they expect. This is Game Training.

* Another category that I feel should exist is General Training, and this is where you can put what general knowledge you would like to impart - if any. This is for things that can be handled out of game - via skype while both players do nothing. Discussion of Game Mechanics, etc. Whatever you are best at. For me it would be Itemization and a counter picking, someone else might know how all the damage ratios work and what champions pair up with what playstyles etc. This is a lot different than teaching someone the basics of a champion and how to lane sustain / last hit. Different metas exist, etc. There is a lot of stuff that doesn't fall under what most training should entail.

* Hours available should be layman. We already know what server people play on. If I play on NA, and I say Central America: Afternoon. Someone can get an idea of what time I am on and if necessary they can message me anyways. 

* Country doesn't matter, although if you speak more than one language it should be listed.

* Status is interesting - but if someone can't handle taking on new prospects then take them off the list IMO.

I am not just a messenger here, I would be more than happy to help build this new system - I just am puzzled if it is something the community is aware of and is interested in fixing - I don't like doing a lot of work/typing etc for little reward (contrary to my post history lol)

Today I published an article which explains how meta works. It started off a bit confusing when it tried to define meta (its like inception that first paragraph) but the rest will help a lot of players I believe! Have a look.

Okay. ~~Arguably~~ Axiomatically the manliest facet of supporting is WARDING! First off, it has 'war' in its name, which we all know is highly manly, but also because it involves looking where you shouldn't and checking out the bot-lane bitchezzzzz like Ashe, Sivir and Tristana (IDGAF). Also lets you gain the upper hand on other alpha males trying to pee all over your territory by seeing them and peeing right back. Even better, when you get Red Wards (everybody says pink but they're red LIKE BLOOD) you can eliminate enemy wards with your manly hammer/bananas/fairy shit.  And don't even get me started on the ELIXIR OF MANLINESS (which I'll actually get on to later).

So, where do I place wards for maximum manliness, Charlie? WELL FUCKING EVERYWHERE but of course not all men have endless money, so you gotta micromanage yo! So, hand-pick your wards and set out for war. Gonna go over 9 good ward spots on the bottom side of the map, and why they're good. Pay close attention. Oh, and summoner? Come back with your shield, or on it!

[MANLY REFERENCE IMAGE](http://imgur.com/a/5rTv2)

1. Okay, worth mentioning this is the only ward that extends into the 'AFK FARM SUX' zone if you're playing on blue side, as it can help if you have a jungler who is also manly and likes to invade. Otherwise, why here? Well, if your mid laner isn't man enough to put the ward himself, go ahead and do it! Because this ward gives you full vision of their jungler's transit between wraiths and red, as well as vision of wraiths if your AP mid decides to suddenly sprout balls (CASSIOPEIA BAD IMAGERY) and steal wraiths, and also if they're coming from red side into river to gank mid or strut their stuff in the water. W/E, good ward spot. Also helps to stick one in your own wraiths if the enemy has it constantly warded, as a BLOOD WARD will stop them from stealing shit.

2. Okay, ward @redbuff. Why? Well, if your jungler's a sad fucker like Amumu who sucks in early levels, and if they have a man like Lee Sin who'd really like that red. Ward up your red and collapse on him when he goes for the steal. In the opposite situation, well. The #1 ward is infinitely better, but I suppose you could ward their red if you reeeeeeeally wanted to. 

3. Okay, lil' ol' ward at that lil' ol' entrance just about the main one into purple side blue buff. Why? WELL FUCK KNOWS! Its kinda average, but it can come in handy I guess. You can stick it in that little patch of bush to protect against a blue invade if you're on purple side, or the same for red if you're on blue, but all in all its kinda overshadowed, by the glorious #1 ward. 

4. TRIBUSH! The tribush represents the three prongs of manliness: chest hair, beer and wenches. It also represents a big fuck-off threat if you're on blue side, which is why its a real snazzy ward to have. If they have a knock-back jungler like Ali, Lee (after 6) or Hecarim (LOL shit) then you can really get fucked up. Also, red team's jungler probably won't be able to resist the temptation of getting behind your manly support arse, so this should counteract most ganks (lane &amp; river still a possibility though so don't get cocky, kid). Ward #6 can also help with that, but we'll get onto that later. 

5. PURPLE TEAM BLUE BUFF. Blue buff is so freakin' OP, and if you're on blue team and wanna be a douche, stick a ward there so that it'll cover time frames like ~7:10 and ~12:30. This way you can all mount an operation to go nick theirs and run away like the men you are. One ward? 75g. Mounting a force? A bit of time. Manliness and endless bitchezzzzzzz? Priceless. Now if you're on purple side, a counter-ward can be of endless help in this situation, particularly if you have blue-reliant champions like Lee Sin, Anivia, Mordekaiser and Swain. You wanna make sure you get that blue, so don't give them the vision they need to steal the buff. If you know blue team warded it, just get a BLOOD WARD and kill that shit with your manly hands.

6. THAT ENTRANCE TO BLUE BUFF THERE THAT ALSO COVERS DRAGON. Such a manly ward, just placing it down will grant you +2 to chest hair, +4 to hand tools and +9 to beer-drinking capabilities. And probably even a Harley-Davidson, too. This ward covers three things, all of which are important to both teams. The entrance to blue buff (defensive if on purple team, offensive if on blue), the entrance to dragon (necessity) and the river between mid lane and bot lane (UMAD ROAMING MID LANES???). Now what does this do? It sets up for manly blue steals, and stops over-confident enemy junglers from stealing yours. It also gives you view of the fuckin' Balrog, which can allow you to properly contest it if the other team makes a play. Finally, as mentioned before, if the mid-laner on the opposite team is someone who roams exceptionally well like Ahri, Cassiopeia and Galio (all totally hot), this ward can stop them from waltzing down the river and ganking you and your carry. Keep roamers out of your territory, man.

7. River brush ward. Kinda meh as it only reveals one thing (the river brush), but can be handy if you're extending on purple side. Not much to say here.

8 and 9. Same shit, different team. These are the lane-brush wards, to prevent sneaky lane ganks and manly killing supports from doing their thing. Now, what brush you put it in depends on your position. If the lane has been frozen in the middle, you want to probably put it in the enemy brush as that's likely where they'll stay. However, if they're pushing hard don't skimp, and dump one in your lane brush. This kind of ward is really effective against those supports that are gonna go for testosterone-fuelled kills like Leona (dyke so pretty manly), Blitzcrank (manly robot like Arnie) and Ali (COWMAN). In turn, if you're one of these supports, it's often a pretty good idea to carry a BLOOD WARD so you can counteract that ward they're sure to put down and keep doing your killing.

OKAY, ELIXIR OF MANLINESS. Some sissy oracle tried to name this shit after him but NO! We just peed on his house and renamed it in an appropriate fashion. Anyway, when is this shit good? Well, its good when you know the enemy's got wards coming out their arse, and you wanna kill them all. Also good when you know you can GTFO after you killed dat ward. Also, weigh up the chance of dying with the potential reward. Often ain't a bad idea to have your jungler come around with you if you're sweeping whilst the enemy jungler is around just to avoid a Charlie Foxtrot. Also, its worth roaming around a bit once you got your elixir and clearing out wards in the 'AFK FARM SUX' zone, providing your carry is manly enough to stay alive whilst you're out strutting your hairy self around.

Think that's it. Probably got some more support guides coming up, so stay manly, fellas! Also, big congrats to this awesome community for finally becoming 5k strong.

---------

Hello summoners!

We've recently gotten a suggestion that might help us cut down on some posts we feel aren't constructive to the community. For example: 

""Hey guys, I was a support Alistar and I laned with an Ashe who went Dagger and never harrassed and never last hit and never hit an arrow and never warded and went 0/10/0 while I did everything I could and it really sucked. **What should I have done better?**""

A lot of these posts are finding ways around our ""no-ranting"" rule by adding in the last, bolded interrogation. So we're implementing the _Let's Rant_ threads on a weekly/biweekly basis for summoners to rant and rave as much as they want **while other summoners offer advice**. But, of course, we have some rules!

-------
Rules:
--

* **Rants and raves will not include any information on any particular individual, ergo, you cannot call out the Ashe who never hit an arrow.**

* **Ranters and ravers must be open to getting advice from others on /r/summonerschool.** 

* **Rants and raves can be about anything you're dying to rant and rave about in League, like how you can't get out of Gold or how you can't carry hard enough.** 

* **Other threads the moderators believe constitute as a rant or rave will be deleted, and the poster will be redirected here.**

* **Keep swearing to a minimum.**

----------

* _But Flaxx, why are we doing this?_

This will cut down on a lot of regurgitated posts on the subreddit by compiling a lot of them into one cohesive thread. In addition, it will give a lot of summoners a place to get their frustrations off of their mind, and, in theory, will help create a more mentally stable community.

* _But Flaxx, I really want some advice on what to do when this stuff happens RIGHT NOW but this thread is 3 days old and no one looks at 3 day old threads!_

If you guys have any champion specific questions about playstyle/matchups/builds/runes I would love to hear them since those are the most fun for me to answer. Feel free to ask whatever you want though.

I'll be playing most of the day and answering questions between games.

**edit: Putting this here for visibility. I feel like its the most important thing in this thread.**

&gt;Play ranked 5s! I really dislike how focused the LoL community is on solo queue when the game is clearly designed to be played as a team. If I could get Riot to make one change to all of LoL I would have them add some kind of incentive to play 5's other than the LCS qualifier spots which only matter to .1% of the player base.

&gt;Really though, 5s is fun and there are teams of all skill levels playing it. You don't have to be super serious LCS-or-die to play. You learn a lot more playing 5s than solo queue as well.

&gt;If there was one thing I could have people take away from this thread its to start playing 5's. I dream of a day when people use their 5s team rating as the standard for skill and everyone treats solo queue as just practice.

&gt;Finally, once you start focusing on 5's you stop caring as much about solo queue. Its just a way to practice a champion or learn something so you can play better in 5's later. This makes it a lot more enjoyable IMO.

edit2: Done playing for now. Thanks for all the questions and I hope the answers were helpful. I'll probably do more sometime later this week. PLAYED RANKED 5's :)

1369773874.0,41,self.summonerschool,1f80so,"Climbed from Bronze V to Silver, just won my promotion today. Here is my story and some tips.",exeneva,57,16,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1f80so/climbed_from_bronze_v_to_silver_just_won_my/,"Relevant image: http://i.imgur.com/OJEp3GW.jpg

I used to think that Bronze V was something you could not get out of, and that elo hell existed. I think learning the little things about this game, as well as focusing on a positive attitude, is the key to doing well in this league.

So here's how it happened. I quit league for about 2 years, then came back recently. I jumped straight into ranked, got into Bronze II, then dropped after a massive loss streak into Bronze V. I started winning more in Bronze V, but my win/loss ratio after getting in (not before) was around 50%. I've taken statistics, and this is alarming because this means I legitimately belonged in Bronze V. After realizing this, I decided maybe I'm not as good of a player as I thought I was. 

I started watching the lecture series you see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ywhB-2h2AE
To this day, I still have not completed the series. I stopped after lecture 4 (the lecture on Silver League and below) and began playing. I picked up Zed and Diana, learned how to play them at a higher-than-bronze level and did well with them. Zed especially -&gt; you literally press R, then E + BorK + ignite and you kill just about anyone. 

Assassins got me through Bronze V. I remember winning three 4v5s in that league, which was frustrating, but players are honestly so bad in Bronze V that you can hyper-carry even when outnumbered. The UNSW video on teamfighting and the silver league/below were especially important in learning how to carry through the bottom pit of bronze.

Bronze IV isn't much different from Bronze V, except I didn't get as many 4v5 games and more 5v5s where nobody knows how to do anything after laning phase. I duo queued with a partner who played adc, and we made non-bronze plays that got us through that tier. By non-bronze I mean taking dragon literally as soon as it's free, grabbing baron if we see someone on the other team bot, grouping mid and pushing after laning phase is over instead of just clearing lanes for 10 mins, etc. It's hard to take charge if you're going solo, but with a duo queue partner you can usually rally the rest of the team to win, despite the fact that most of them just want to do their 'bronze' things (like clear lanes/jungle for 10 mins).

In Bronze III I decided to focus more on my adc skills. I rewatched the first UNSW lecture and learned how to freeze the lane in the 'sweet spot'. In particular, I remember a game where we had a 0/5 morde mid, but I told my support to ward the river in case bot roams as I locked the lane right outside tower range. By the time the lane was back in the middle, I had almost a 50 cs lead on their Vayne, and I was the only person in the game with over 100 cs at that time. In fact, their Vayne was totally fucked just because I locked the lane - she tried roaming mid, but our wards shut that down. She tried to jungle, but 2 golems isn't enough to catch up to my minion farm. Their bot lane literally had nothing to do for a good 5 mins, it was beautiful.
We won that game later, even with our feeding morde.

Bronze III is where I realized most games are carry-able, but you occasionally have the one game or two where the loss is just going to happen and you have to 'factor it in'. 

Bronze II is when I started getting the occasional silver player on my team. I played mostly jungle through Bronze II, focusing on Sejuani. I really like Sejuani for several reasons: 1.) never banned, 2.) very tanky, 3.) good CC. I said earlier I know how statistics work, and Sejuani has the highest winrate across all tiers in NA as a jungler (even higher than hecarim and amumu). Granted, hecarim is played more often, but sejuani seemed like the perfect 'secret op' jungler. I really fell in love with jungle in Bronze II, because I realized that if a lane was losing I could get them going again. Sejuani is tanky as fuck and I started having real success with her when I started doing more all-ins and dives to make sure lanes were guaranteed to get kills.

Bronze I is where I hit a plateau for about a week. I lost several games after getting to Bronze I, got demoted to Bronze II, then got back into Bronze I again. I realized my skills had capped off at this point and that I needed to relearn my basics. I rewatched the first two UNSW videos, watched some streams, and then jumped back into league. The result was a 9-game winstreak that put me all the way up to the top of Bronze I. I lost a game or two after that, then got on hotstreak again to make series.

Series was rough because I had some silvers that are worse than some of the bronze players I saw in bronze V. In one of my series games, I had a first time Yorick (according to lolnexus) who was running AP runes. However, I am quite convinced that I am not Bronze level anymore, probably not even low silver level. It's a good feeling knowing that you are going to dominate in whatever lane you take, so you only have to worry about the other two lanes either being equal or feeding.

My series went like this: Loss - Win -Loss - Win - Win

I may be offering some coaching in the near future to anyone else who wants to make the climb. Here are some tips I found that made ridiculous amounts of difference:

-Freezing lane. There is a sweet spot in every lane, and if you learn how to freeze the lane (this involves your champ tanking minions sometimes), you will leave the other laner with nothing to do for a good 2-3 minutes at minimum until the lane goes back to the middle. The other laner may roam or farm his own jungle, so make sure to tell your team to be careful or have a ward. In mid lane, this is less effective, but for top and bot it does wonders.

-Assassins like Diana, Zed, Kha'Zix, and Akali are especially strong in Bronze. I am actually not a good Diana player, but I have had games where I go 0/2 in lane and end up getting fed later on due to teamfight positioning and good focus. I have a little saying, ""in bronze, assassins will just get kills, regardless if they feed early on.""

-If playing jungler, gank on opportunity, not on a formula. Part of why I played jungler a lot during my climb was because a lot of bronze junglers gank on some sort of formula or rhythm that just doesn't work due to the dynamic nature of the game. There have been many times where I am doing wraiths, then I see the enemy mid start pushing, so I ping like crazy (leaving wraiths) and go straight to mid and get my mid a kill. This is another tip - don't be locked into the notion that you have to finish your creeps. Gank on opportunity, you can finish wraiths/golems when you come back.

MOST IMPORTANT TIP OF ALL: If your team is willing to cooperate with you (and a lot of solo queue teams will not), don't derp after laning phase. Bronze games tend to go like this: 1.) laning, 2.) 10 minutes of jungling and wave clearing, 3.) Kill someone on the other team out of position, OMG GO PUSH NOW. You can exploit this pattern. After laning phase, group mid and push hard. The other team will be too busy clearing lanes top/bot or jungling to save outer/inner mid in time. At all moments of the game, there is going to be one team on OFFENSE and one team on DEFENSE. Defense = clearing lanes/jungle, offense = pushing towers, taking objectives (dragon, baron). Try to be the team on offense, but also know when you need to be on defense.

If you managed to get through all this, thanks for reading! As I mentioned, I may be interested in doing some coaching in the near future or even some duo queue/spectating while skyping to give tips to anyone else who wants to make this climb.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1f80so,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1f80so/climbed_from_bronze_v_to_silver_just_won_my/,

I've been hovering around Gold elo for a long time, blaming my teamates and never myself. It wasn't until a recent change mentality did I start soaring in elo/LKS/divsions/whatever.

In two days I went from Gold V to Gold I Day after that I hit Platinum V and day after that I went to Platinum IV, and most of this came with a change of mentality.

I believe a big part of bettering yourself in League of Legends is having the proper mentality.  In my opinion if you want to rise in elo you try to learn a few champions. I've played Ahri, Lux, Riven, and a bunch of other champions long enough that I can often just first pick them and not be afraid of a counter pick. Matchup knowledge is much better than just getting a counterpick. I've played Ahri vs Ryze and I think its a mistake that Ryze is a counter. Because if you play your champions strengths you'll still have chances to be succesful. 

For example: Ahri can push the wave much faster, and more reliable than Ryze(who needs to ult to compete.) When you push your wave and you're past level six you are free to roam and gank; helping other lanes when you're in control of yours is what makes a mid player important. When a mid player is free to get off the map and gank that puts incredible pressure on the side lanes; and if they don't play careful you're free to gank and either they blow summoners or you can net a double kill.

The point if that is every champion has strengths and weaknesses, Ryze can juke Ahri's skill shots with his mobility from R, and throw painful spells at her for a lot of damage. But he can't farm as fast as her, so don't dread on what they're doing to you - you need to focus on what you can do to them, or their team.

Top laners for example, expecially those with some kind of CC like Riven can push the wave early. No one wants to fight Riven lvl 2 or 3. So if you push the wave to turret you can roam mid, or check the enemy jungle and take wolves or golems or wraiths. 

Learning matchups is easier with champions that you love, when you play incredible amounts of games against counter picks you start to get better and better.

For Solo Queue I think it's incredibly important to learn one - two champions per role, but learn them well. Don't just skim over abilities and such. Like so many Pantheons will W well their passive is up, and sometimes lose a duel because of it. 

Myself I learned: Top: Riven/Shen/Akali/Nidalee/Rumble Mid: Ahri/Lux/Kat Bot: Caitlyn/Alistar/Lulu/Miss Fortune

Playing these champions over and over helped me win in Solo Queue, and learn how to play the game.

Always buy at least one ward when you back, no matter who you are, or what lane you are. In solo queue don't rely on your support(unless you're duoing.) Don't trash them for not buying wards, just buy one, it won't ruin your build and put you far behind.

Mid laners this is most important for you since ganks can make or break your lane. Try to ward enemy wraith camp to prevent roaming mids, and spot the enemy jungler.

Don't rage, no matter how bad your teamates are don't get mad. It's hard sometimes, but just do your best. Solo Queue is about bettering yourself not your teammates. When you play it you're improving only yourself. It will also get you banned. &gt;:(

Baron is the #1 throw in Solo Queue. Don't do it if there's a chance they can steal it or ace your team. This is a big comeback for the team you just pulled ahead of and will give them the momentum to turn the close game around.

Objectives! They are up all the time, and when you complete one, more open to you. When you win a fight Baron isn't the only objective. There's plenty for you to do, buffs, dragon, turrets, push waves. Just do something after your team secures a kill. 

Communication is almost as important as your individual skill. Tell your team what do to, you don't want a disorganized team. What may seem obvious to you might not be obvious to everyone else.  Just because you saw Maokai in our tribush doesn't mean bottom lane did. So ping, or type it out. Or tell your jungle to help you push lane and get put damage on a turret, or back without losing exp.

Losing streaks. These are such discouraging things when it comes to Solo Queue. After a loss, no matter what it was just take a break. Watch a youtube video, brush your teeth, get a drink, anything. Just kill some time and let it reset.

Don't lose a game at champion select. Complaining about bad bans, or picks won't change those picks once they're locked in. Instead take that time and think what you can do to win, or pick to compliment the pick. Like when someone picks Teemo Top. It's a bad pick for the team, but good for pressuring the map. So pick other champions that can do so. 

Last hitting, people say this a lot but it is true. Last hitting is very important in all lanes and I have some tips on how to do it. When you're on turret Melee minions take two hits from turret; then you auto. Caster Minions take one and then you auto.  For midlane it's the same, except Caster Minions you auto, let the turret hit, then auto again. It's a little hard at first but you will get used to it.  A possible of 130 minions are last hittable before 10 minutes. I think. Roughly. So try to aim for 85-100, that is good. You aren't doublelift so don't get frustrated when you miss one, or two in a row. Try and count the CS you miss in lane not the ones you get. The game does that for you. Next game try and lower that number. Whatever you do don't suicide for creeps. Countless times I've seen an ADC be 1v2 bottom because the support backed or warded, and they'd go to last hit only to get engaged on and die. Pay attention to your lane partner. Think about a few things, can you get to the turret safely?  Your life isn't worth 18-40 gold.  So just stay in exp range if possible and don't fall behind in levels.

Below are some really useful links that inspired me. All of GBAY99's videos are incredible, and insightful. They are also well researched so give them a look! If you have any questions feel free to ask, or I can elaborate on anything if you want.

I have been recently contacted as becoming a coach for a team but its not set in stone and i wont be fielding any questions about it. I still enjoy watching this game and before i leave this subreddit for a good long while i thought it would be a decent time to leave behind things i have learned both teaching and playing this game.

I promised a few people that i would write a guide to how to improve your own play... but seeing how every time i sit down to write it i always get distracted. (Once by my thesis... which shows you how bad the situation is) I still hope to finish that and hopefully this AMA will give me the feedback required to finish it.

A few things about my history with this game and teaching:

* I was absolutely awful at this game when i started. Lucky i had friends who were very good at this game and by playing against them and watching how they beat me i was able to make myself serviceable at this game.
* I am very picky about choosing full time students. But over 2 years out of the 5 i have chosen all have made at least a 400 elo jump with one making an almost 1k jump in elo from 800 to 1750 last season. 2 of which ending up in last seasons diamond bracket.

* I think mindset and self confidence are the two most important things when it comes to learning. And i am of the strong opinion that Elo hell does not exist and after 100 ranked games you are within 100 Elo of your skill level.

* I used to run a few things having to do with summonerschool that i no longer have the time to run. If you are interesting in being a teacher in summonerschool i can help you set some things up. Like how to run inhouses etc.

Over the past year this community has changed a lot. More people isnt always a good thing but good with the bad. In the end the goal of this community is admirable and i hope as i check back in over the coming months it continues to grow.

I am still willing to teach as my laptop has the ability to spectate games just fine. I am more than willing to do team coaching over the next two days and individual coaching via spectating as well.

Things i will be more willing to answer:

* Given your situation how to improve your own gameplay.

* General ways to teach yourself

* What to look for in a mentor/student

* Things i think would be good for this community and why

* Meta changes over the past years

* Questions about supports/anylane (Minus items)

* General non personal things about myself (aka nothing i have to give you a proper noun to answer)

What i wont answer:

* Opinions on specific people in the community

* Item builds (things are so game dependent and its something you should learn for yourself)

* Why your teammates always suck(ps they dont)

I will also be on mumble for the next two days most likely in pug 13 if you want to discuss the game, ask me questions about self improvement, want me to watch a replay with you or watch you play, or just want to talk about anything (kittens preferred).

I am Curtis 'Fourpaws' Plant, a league of legends player who has been playing for over a year now. Coming from a background of HumElvesvsOrcUnd on warcraft III (If anyone even remembers that game :p ) to DoTa to League of Legends; I have played multiple MoBa games, even those that are long forgotten today.

This new channel is dedicated to teaching players basics of top lane gameplay in the current meta. The 'Solo-top' position has been my favorite since almost the beginning of my League experience. However I had to put a lot of time and effort into improving myself, in example watching countless hours of streams, reading guides, theory crafting and obviously playing the game. The Idea of this channel is to help anyone at any skill level improve upon their game, perhaps a chance at improving their ELO and such.

If you have a friend who's new to the game, this will hopefully be a useful resource to them to learn top lane.

**What to expect**
For this channel I intend to:

*Create Specific Champion Guides* This includes Masteries/Runes/Skilling order/ Item build / Play styles / and some useful tips and tricks for that champion. I intend to do this for every top lane champion.

*Tips and Tricks* In general, such as [the warding video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl-NUlulvgY&amp;feature=youtu.be) (Please note. The windy audio coming through only appears on youtube, not on the original file fixing this right now! :) )I am releasing as I type this. These will give insight into some of the functions that happen on top lane that can be difficult to grasp for newer players and harder to master for adept players. Another example would be 'Trading' in lane.

*Commentaries* of full length gameplays, breaking down what I am doing, why I am doing this and such. I intend to do this for every top lane champion.

*And more* Depending on how things play out I intend to increase the types of content to this channel.

I may edit this, however for now I will leave you with some additional information.

**This is the first time I have ever done anything like this**, including talking to my computer and trying to put across information. I should improve over time so I apolgise if my voice is monotone or is a pain to listen to, I will work on this!

**And Please, give any criticism, feedback and such** so that I can improve. I want this to be a good experience for everyone who cares to take part, and with your help, I see future videos being 1000% better than this one.

I'm working on a volibear champion guide at the moment.

Thank you, and good luck for this project I guess.

I have a few tips unrelated to this game that have helped me improve. Not significantly, but a fairly big improvement none-the-less. Incoming wall of text. (sorry if I ramble. My general points are there and I felt a bit of backstory was necessary to help prove my point.)


Ok so I've roughly played about 1k games. Sitting at Bronze II currently and I'll probably make it to Bronze I tonight. You might be thinking ""HAH, What can this shittly little Bronze player teach me about this game? He's fuckin' Bronze scrub etc etc...""

Well, in season 2 I got too as low as 800 elo. I was so damn pissed off that I was so low and was just your usual low elo player. Blamed team, didn't make an initiative to actually learn what I was doing wrong, etc. So I stopped playing ranked. Grinded out a few hundred more normals to improve my mechanics, gameplay knowledge and just too boost my confidence a bit.

After about 4 months of not playing ranked I went back in. I had one goal in mind. Get too Gold before the season ended. I considered myself a much better player then I was back then so I thought I would easily make it. But after all that practice, I still wasn't gaining that much elo. After about 50 games I had risen too 900. I was getting really frustrated again and just couldn't think of what the hell I was doing wrong. I knew I was at least gold level in mechanics/knowledge because I would play 5 man draft with my friends and manage to not get carried. Hell I even carried some games.

So season 2 ended. And I was still at 900. After the season ended I told myself I was done with ranked. It was stressing me out way too much. And then I realised. Why the fuck am I getting so pissed off about it? In reality, all that number was, just that. A number. No matter how big it got or small, it would not actually affect my life at all. So I went into ranked once more in pre-seaon 3. 5 of my 15 placement matches I got afk/trolls. I lost another 5. And so there I was, back at 900 elo! It didn't really bother me this time though. Everyone gets trolls in there game and I just happened to be unlucky. Shit happens. But that doesn't mean I didnt stay away from ranked for a while. So after a few weeks of justt casual playing, I thought maybe I was setting the bar too high for myself?

It's great to have goals in mind. But there is such a thing as setting them too high to achieve in the near future. Sure, we all want to be them players in challenger, streaming too 20k plus people. Or playing in tournaments to over 200k people earning up to $100,000. But think about it. I could be wrong, but I think there are about 16 million active monthly LoL players. At the season 2 world championship there were 60 active players in this tournament. Just think about that. 16 MILLION active players. And 60, make it too the World Championship. 

You have to be realistic with your Goals. I didn't start improving until I started setting lower goals for myself. When these leagues came around I was in Bronze V. I decided, hey, maybe Gold is a little out of reach at the moment. Lets just take this one tier at a time. After a 5 win streak I was in my promotion series. I was nervous as hell, this was it. I could finally complete a goal I had set in League. Too my luck, the enemy team got an afk in 2 matches in a row. Next game was a steam roll. There I was Bronze IV! Finally, I had reached a goal. And you know what? It felt damn good. I know that's kinda stupid because it's only Bronze IV, but dammit I finally achieved something! So from then on, I don't set long term goals in this game. I feel it just puts far too much pressure on yourself. And now we fast forward a few months and here I am, nearly at Bronze I and every promotion has felt just as good.

 Now, I'm not saying this will guaranteed work for you. That would be stupid. But if you, like me, weren't really rising up the ladder and just kinda let it get too you, stop letting it get too you. Doesn't help you. Hell take a break from ranked for a while. Start playing normals with some friends for some fun. And if you don't have any friends to play with just pm me. I'm always up for some normal shenanigans.


So to kind of wrap things up, set small achievable goals. Does wonders for confidence, which imo is just as vital as game knowledge, mechanics etc. Also don't be so caught up in losing. Think of Newtons third law of motion ""Law III: To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction..."" For every persons win/achieved goal/w.e someone has to fail their goal/lose. It's just how it works. So getting all worked up about it doesn't help you one bit. It just puts more stress on you.

tl:dr just read it if you want help. It's healthy to read.

Winning your lane means nothing if you don't use it to extend your advantage and keep the enemy behind.**

So this is something that I see a lot from lower league players. They say they win their lane and get snowballed the majority of the time, but they still end up losing games because &gt;any excuse&lt;.

Let's take an example. You're top. You get first blood with your jungler early, then kill your opponent a second time by 10 mins. You're zoning them and you're up 20 cs. At this point, you're ~1.5k gold or so ahead of your opponent. You can basically kill them over and over.

Now, if you *do* kill them over and over, their gold worth goes down for every kill. At 3 deaths, they're worth ~120g. 4 deaths and that's ~70g. At this point, killing them instead of cs'ing actually loses you gold if you miss 3+ cs.

Taking the 10 min example above. All other lanes are even, but you keep your opponent from farming. Chances are they'll just go do their jungle and start roaming, coming to lane to farm a little when you go back. It gets to 20 mins and you've killed them another 3 times. You're ~70 cs ahead now. 

This is what I feel is happening in these games where they dominate top yet still lose. They've won top, easily. Far and away ahead of the enemy. But the other lanes are even, they've taken a tower and a dragon or 2. You've been focused on ""winning your lane"" that you haven't done anything about ""winning the game"".

Start again at the 10 min example. Instead of farming the enemy top, you go push top out and then roam mid. Mid back off, you push down mid turret. Now they have no map pressure on the top side of the map. You go buy, push out top then go kill 1 at bot and take dragon. You're either fighting 4v5 with top trying to farm back in to the game, or 5v5 and they're top is weak and not getting any farm at all.

In the second example, you've taken your lane advantage and used it to influence the game as a whole. You've taken map control with turrets, you've gotten a bigger gold advantage with taking dragon. This is what I almost NEVER see in games at low leagues. Once lanes get an advantage, they'll just sit in lane and farm for 20-25 mins and not actually use that advantage for anything.

Stop thinking about ""winning your lane"" or ""needing to farm"" or whatever. If you're ahead, use that to get even further ahead **elsewhere** on the map.

1361217418.0,40,self.summonerschool,18rovt,Tips for Laning against Teemo,Darktakashi,47,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18rovt/tips_for_laning_against_teemo/,"Hello summoners, I'm going to give some tips on how to lane against Teemo, I've played League of legends for around 8 months now (I've played Dota and HoN before so yeah) my main roles are Jungle and Top and usually when I see someone else top they see Teemo as their worst nightmare (literally he's annoying) I also play Teemo a lot and find it such a stomp unless I get hard countered (Yorick, Pantheon).
So here's some tips to kill the little badger.

* Don't let Teemo just push you to your tower, you must PUSH HIM.  Now this is done against a lot of champions that are spamhappy pokers such as Yorick.  The reason why you must push a champion like teemo under his tower to farm is because he will be forced to decide between poking you or getting CS (generally CS is better because you want those big items), this is dangerous though because it gives the enemy jungler a chance to loop behind you and gank you so make sure to always buy AT LEAST 1 sightward when you go back (It's only 75g and it can save you from giving the enemy 300g!)

* Don't try to fight Teemo early on if you're melee, Teemo's main job in lane is to stall the laning phase and snowball out of having the ranged advantage, try not to fight him when he pokes you, it's not worth it, ever, it's only going to waste the potions you should be using to get all the CS you can while getting poked, teemo will always be safe in a 1v1 vs most top laners.

* Itemize and mastery wise against Teemo, most likely Top lane teemo will be going AD or On-hit (both of which are ADish) now this usually relies on his E damage so itemize against the Poison by getting Mercury trends OR spirit visage if it's a good item on your champion.

* Make sure to take the Mastery ""Unyielding"" this blocks all champion damage by 2, it may not sound a lot but this is very good against champions such as Teemo, Singed, Darius who all have DoTs (Damage over time) so for example Teemo's Level 1 Poison will tick 6 damage per second for 4 seconds, now that's 24 magic damage but every tick is -2 damage so that means instead of 24 magic damage you're taking 16 damage, now that's 8 damage less, it may not sound a lot but worth while this will negate a lot of damage and will add up with your resistance later on.

* Lastly don't be afraid to ask for your jungler to force his lane down, what I mean is you want to ask your ally jungler to gank him early on (lvl 3-4 gank) to kill him and take his tower away, now this isn't the best choice but it's great if you're certain champions that can survive ganks easily like Singed.  This also allows you to push the lane to his second tower and roam to other lanes and try to snowball but I usually prefer to freeze the lane where his tower should be and farm.

That's all the tips I have for laning against teemo, GL summoners and beat up the evil badger yordle.

I see a lot of questions about which champs to carry with, but it seems to me people are really asking for a solid/safe pick instead.

You see, there are basically 5 ways to play.  Every game ends with you in one of the 5 categories.  

First, you lose the lane and feed the other guy so bad that he can one shot your entire team.  This is something that is always avoidable and you should never let this happen.

Second, you lose the lane gracefully.  Maybe you died once, and are behind in CS.  Maybe you didn't die at all, yet you are still behind in CS.  This is losing.  If you are behind the other guy you lost.  Period. This is where counter picks come into play as they will force the other player to give up CS so they don't die.  

Third, you win the lane.  You have higher CS than the other guy.  In rare cases you can have the same amount of CS and still 'win' if you scale better into late game that your opponent.  

Fourth, you get fed.  You opponent plays like an idiot and keeps dying to you.  You have more CS than them and every time you seen him you kill him.  We have all been there, but this is not carrying.  This is winning.  Hard.

Lastly, is when you are actually carrying.  You get fed, you are stomping your lane, but most importantly you affect the other lanes.

I am a new player, only level 13 or so, and having trouble getting better. I decided to start playing after a few of my favorite SC2 players switched over, and now I've really been enjoying the game. Unfortunately, I feel as if I've hit a wall. I play Nasus/Olaf/Twisted Fate and have been trying out Vayne, but I feel like I am just feeding a lot. Then when I get behind, I try and farm my way back, but then I just die more. This leads to being 0/9 or something, with the other team being crazy strong and my team mates raging. The thing is, I understand that rage, I was feeding. It wasn't intentional, but regardless, I simply gave the team kills. I am bad. I don't know how to really get better. I watch a lot of guides, read mobafire guides for all my champions and follow builds, and I watch streams. I guess this is a pretty whiny post, but does anybody have any tips or ideas?

I did not think these ideas up but I find a lot of people neglecting them and I have noticed that the majority of my wins are due to the whole team doing these things as apposed to any one player getting fed and carrying.

*if you see the top laner and jungler top, and your jungler is near dragon, rush immediately to dragon and ping all teammates nearby to join.

*If you have a nubmers advantage while pushing a tower, don't tower dive the enemy unless you KNOW you can kill them in 1 to 2 seconds or you KNOW that the rest of your team can push down the tower within the first 2 to 3 seconds of you taking turret aggro. A tower down is worth more than a kill. If they will survive or you will go 1 for 1, it's not worth the dive... just take the tower and back off to farm/ secure other objectives.

*If the tower is dying and you are alone against 3 or more enemies... Just back off. You're just going to die as soon as the tower does, and then the enemies will likely get another tower or dragon/baron because they have a numbers advantage.

*when split pushing, pay attention to how many of the enemy team respond. If they have you outnumbered, you can create an easy distraction for the rest of your team to push another lane by harrrassing/ clearing waves without getting close enough to get engaged on. DO NOT GET ENGAGED ON. 

*if you have all 5 mid and see an enemy in another lane, engage immediately.

*If you are the top or mid laner, buy wards. Do not be that guy saying ""noob support, no vision."" You should be buying 1 or 2 wards on almost every back, all game. Wards win games.

*in low elo especially, don't do baron unless one or more enemies are dead. They will come fight you and you will have spells on CD and they will kill you.

I'm sure I forgot plenty so feel free to add any tips you have to the list!

1375327991.0,40,self.summonerschool,1jgy1u,"The New Master Yi, and why he is awesome",angelothewizard,48,8,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jgy1u/the_new_master_yi_and_why_he_is_awesome/,"I guess it's time for someone to be the brave man to play the new Master Yi, and so I boldly loaded up my Chosen skin, briefly bemoaned the visual changes, and played a couple rounds with the new Master Yi. My verdict? He's better then before.

Passive: Double Strike: Every 4 attacks, Master Yi strikes twice, the second attack dealing half damage. This is actually probably the worst part of the new Yi, because there's something they don't tell you: You need to string all of those attacks together, or you lose your stacks of Double Strike. Each attack must be made within about 3 seconds of each other, or else you have to start over. Which makes sense in terms of Yi's character, it makes sense he'd be double striking in combat, but when running around he'd lose the focus he needs to double tap. It should be noted that Double Strike procs all on-attack effects as the old one did-keep this in mind.

Q: Alpha Strike. Works almost exactly like before, but now comes with a very handy visual indicator telling you the radius of Yi's jumps. Other then that, the biggest change is that it works off AD now instead of AP-AP Yi is sadly no longer among us. The cooldown has been bumped up (I believe), but it is compensated by reducing the cooldown of Alpha Strike by one second with each basic attack (I could not tell if Double Strike reduced it by 2. I suspect not). 

W: Meditate: Of all Yi's abilities, this one has been nerfed, and HARD. The cooldown is similar (and may even be a lot less), but the damage reduction is nowhere near the old meditate's reduction, and the healing is a lot less. Yi heals more with Meditate the less health he has, so this is primarily meant to be used when outside combat (or when everyone is DEAD). It's still very useful, and contributes a lot to Yi's jungling potiential while also giving him some sustain if he's forced into lane. It also still works for reducing damage, if needed-just don't do it if more then one guy is attacking.

E: Wuju Style: Passive-Yi gains a bonus to Attack Damage equal to a percentage of his total AD. Active: Yi deals True Damage for 6 seconds, and loses the Passive bonus of Wuju style while this ability is on cooldown. 

OH MY GOD THIS IS AWESOME. This is awesome for taking on dragon and baron, but is actually less effective against turrets (I didn't see True Damage kick in when I was buzzsawing towers). The extra AD gives Alpha Strike a boost, and the True Damage gets proced on Double Strike. Suddenly, Yi can take on Tanks and WIN. 

Ultimate: Highlander: Passive: The cooldown of Yi's basic abilities is reduced by 18 seconds every time he scores a kill (half for assists). Active: Boost to Move Speed, Boost to Attack Speed, and all kills or assists achieved while Highlander is active increases the duration by 4 seconds (10 second duration).

Highlander is just as awesome as it once was, with the added bonus of you don't need to Highlander in order to get that sweet cooldown. Most of Yi's Cooldowns are 18 seconds, so yes, you can still Alpha Strike until the enemy is dead. And you can still chain Highlander kills like no tomorrow.

All in all, The remade Yi is actually BETTER then the old one. AP Yi might be dead, but the dunkmaster and tower chainsaw has returned. I'm still experimenting with builds, but Yi can not only stomp a lane but can dominate the jungle with ease.

&gt;Going late game focused builds is much more optimal in solo q than it is in competitive. So going heal and lots of gp5's and stuff like that will win solo Q, where going full hp quints and buying tons of wards and such is optimal in competitive.

&gt;I tend to do both in solo Q depending on what I'm feeling at the time.

&gt;I agree completely that copying from LCS for solo Q support is not very applicable at all, at least if your goal is to gain ELO.

I am very guilty of this. I see what the pro's do, and I mimic it. Now, I'm learning that this is not true, and I'm trying to re-evaluate. So...what can and can't be applied?

I'm in Silver 3 and trying to climb as best I can. I want to learn to be as good as possible and to do things efficiently, but I don't want to apply the wrong things from LCS. Here are a few examples I'm stuck on:

* Opening builds for supports. In the LCS/OGN, it's basically always 3 Greens 1 Pink and 5 pots. Is that not correct in soloq?

* Support runes are HP quints, AD reds, etc. How should you do it in soloq?

* Supports go Ruby Sightstone, Moba Boots, then they are done. In Soloq, I guess supports should be building more items? But doesn't that mean less vision...?

* As a jungler, (let's say as Elise) can I start Doran's blade? I saw that in the OGN...or should I only start machete/pots?

For example, I was jungling Lee Sin and saw Vi and Darius trading in the top lane while I was doing wolves.  I saw them ignite each other so stopped doing wolves halfway through and ran up to help Vi.  Neither of them died but I was able to get an easy q on Darius by his tower for first blood!  Had I been watching myself kill the wolves that wouldn't have happened.

However, this trick works better for champions who can clear relatively fast with non targeted aoe and autoattacks (i.e. amumu and lee sin).

1335281025.0,38,self.summonerschool,sq240,As promised: a quick guide to those looking to try out the free champions,Loop_Within_A_Loop,44,6,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/sq240/as_promised_a_quick_guide_to_those_looking_to_try/,"Hey all, I posted yesterday, and it seemed there was interest, so here we go. Basically, if you are looking for someone to tell you how to build your hero, this is not the place. Go to solomid or lolpro for that. I'm going to offer you a few general tips to keep in mind when trying the free week champions for the first time.

**Ahri**: try to use your ultimate offensively rather than defensively; also, landing your E should give you an open opportunity to land both your Q and W, resulting in tons of damage

**Corki**: Smartcast your ultimate. In general, you'll be pretty close to spamming it in fights, and your ulti really allows you to duel well. Also, your Q reveals units that get hit by it, so don't facecheck dem bushes. Lastly, his passive takes the raw damage you would deal (including crits and sheen procs), before armor reduction, so it scales extremely well; Grab one point in W very early, and max it last. It is used as an escape, not an initiate, as the cast animation is very clumsy (thanks buffofspades :)

**Graves**: Don't be afraid to get in people's faces especially if your passive is stacked. Graves is a man, fucking act like it.

**Maokai**: Oftentimes, leading with sapling before Twisted Advancing onto someone will guarantee that the second tick of saplings will hit them. If you are max range twisted advancing, you may want to W-&gt;E-&gt;Q, instead in order to get both ticks, especially if they are in their minion line.

**Nunu**: Try to predict where the enemy will go, and hide in a brush to channel your ult. It is game changing.

**Rammus**: Ok. conversely, to quote Delmain, "" Jungle, build HoG/Philo and defensive items. Don't fall for his passive, build maybe one armor item and one MR item, but don't forget health. His W gives a ton of survivability. Get a level of W first to jungle, and pick up Q and E before trying a gank. Max E for maximum enemy disruption. Use your ult liberally, it has a relatively short cooldown and hurts towers/inhibs. Be warned though, any fast jungler will easily be able to counter-jungle you and you won't really be able to do anything about it. You need good ward coverage in the river and to coordinate with your allies to collapse on invading enemy junglers.""

**Ryze**: smartcast everything, lead your combos off with W if you are going for the kill; also, make sure you cast Q after every other ability you cast to do maximum damage (thanks Delmain)

**Shaco**: Props to CharlieDOliver for this: ""Shaco: do everything in your power to be the biggest dick you can possibly be. Get those early kills, you really need them. Max Q first. Run Exhaust/Smite for more kill potential. Wriggle's, Boots of Mobility and IE should be core. Remember, be a dick. Box the enemy blue at around 6:50, assuming they started there. Solo dragon at Lv. 6 with Madred's like a boss. Gank some more lanes. Be a dick. Hit people from behind for bonus damage. Aim their carry in teamfights. Ult to confuse people. Use boxes in ganks for the fear. Use Q to escape from the most bullshit situations.
Oh, and did I mention being a dick?""

**Sion**: in general, your combo is: back away from the fights-&gt;W-&gt;wait 2 seconds-&gt;Q-&gt;W, ignite kill; also, if you are going AP, not skill ulti at 6 is in general a god idea. Also, your ulti makes you a huge baron threat if you are AD, or AP once you have Lich Bane. 2 man baron is easily done if you have someone else to tank.

**Soraka**: you have so many heals/armor, you are really good at baiting. Abuse it.

Hey all, I hope this was of help. I hope to expand this in the coming weeks, but I'm really busy until finals is over. If you have anything to add, do so in the comments for everyone to hear.

As we pushed down mid for the beginning of end game, I got slaughtered for the 1000th time by zac leaping over our front line and renek just walking through it while my team was fighting their squishies.  I asked for someone to peel for me, and the Jayce uttered his fateful line.

tl;dr: Against a team with amazing disruption, is zephyr a bad choice?

I don't main adc, it's my 4th best position, so I'm asking for real advice, not ""omg you noob""/""omg that noob"".  

Edit 1: I built it after BT, IE and LW.  It was my ""attack speed"" option instead of PD.

I get very high win streaks with Annie, and often too but I feel the the general consensuses is that you shouldn't play her. When I do get that rare Annie vs Annie mid lane situation, I ALWAYS dominate and harass them to an extent that they become useless. 

This is my general play style, I know people say not to save up stun, and to keep Qing to gain farm, but I usually just don't auto attack and try last hitting with my basic attack letting the minions do most of the work ( unless of course I made the opponent recall then I want their enemy tower to eat up all my minions). If I keep my stun up, I can always deny them CS since every time they get close, I go to attack.

My general build is either DeathFire Grasp   or Abyssal Scepter since it makes them go from 23% magic resistance to 9% assuming they don' gain and stay at the base 30.

Most people recommend Magic Penetration boots, but I always wait for boots until mid game, then buy Lucidity Boots since Annie can do major damage with her Q and W, but the cool-downs are long and you can get killed before they are back.

The majority of people in Bronze consider themselves better than everyone else because they can generally win their lane but can't win the game. So people always ask: how do I carry the game? what champs are good to carry with? After a few bad placement matches I went from Bronze 4-&gt;Silver in 5 days with a 65-70% win rate mostly playing mid. Take all this advice with a grain of salt since I'm not Platinum or Diamond, but I know how to win the majority of Bronze games and hopefully this advice will help all of you get out of that dreaded league.

**How To Get Ahead In Lane As A Mid Laner**

**Farm** 

This is one of the most important ways to get ahead in lower ELOs. Almost no one properly farms at that stage because no one thinks it's that important. Let's take mid for example. Generally you will have an opponent who thinks it is his job to try to kill you early and will focus on harassing you. All you need to do is start off with a ward or two and farm the minion waves as they come. Obviously if you can get a clear kill get it, but if not? Continue to farm, farm, farm. When your jungler is out helping other lanes pick up your wraiths/wolves. When you see the enemy jungler far away enough pick up his wraiths/wolves. Push the creep wave, grab the wraiths, keep going. If you can outfarm your opponent this way you could have no kills 15 minutes in but you will have so much more gold that once you start being able to clear waves instantly and harass him he will not stand a chance. You will normally be 1-2 levels higher than everyone else in the game and can just get a kill mid -&gt; roam -&gt; farm -&gt; repeat. If you learn how to farm like a Gold+ player in a Bronze game I guarantee your win rate will go up. 

Side note, even in late game: CONTINUE TO FARM. Many people make this mistake where they will get ahead early in lane and give up farming 20 minutes in. Don't do this! Every 10-20 creeps = the same amount of gold as a kill so continue to farm when you can until the end of the game.

**Learn Your Enemy's Abilities**

Going up against a champ that you are unfamiliar with? Take the few minutes while the game is loading just to briefly read up on the champ's abilities and cooldowns. This will help you tremendously. I remember going up against a Malzahar (a champ I don't normally see) and getting crushed because I had no idea what he could do. Any time you are facing a champ that you don't at least know what each of their abilities can do make sure to read up on them so you can counter at the right times and stay far away at other times (for example: never tower dive Zed when his ult is up; don't stand near Akali's invisible bubble when you are marked with her Q).

**Capitalize On Your Opponent's Mistakes**

This only applies when you are very knowledgeable about your opponent's champ. If you know the enemy's champion well enough that you have his/her cooldowns memorized, capitalize when they misuse them! For example, if I am going against a Zed as Diana I know that his W (shadow placement/escape) has a 15-20 second cooldown. If I see him throw it out to farm minions I'll put my shield up, and Q-R him while and get in a few AA's because I know that he can't just W out of it and then harass me safely. Or if I'm Fizz against Kassadin and see that he just ulted towards me and used his E/Q, I'll hit him with my E/Q/W to land a lot of damage when I know he can't silence me or get away. Continue like this and you will eventually come out on top in trades.

**Call Your Jungler**

You have a jungler for a reason. He can very easily turn a losing lane into a winning lane if you call him at the right time. Check to see if your opponent bought a ward and take note of where they place it. If you see that he is overextended (more towards your side of the map than his) with no vision, ping for help from your jungler. If he comes in at the right time this will secure a kill and you've just gained another lead.

**Ward**

The golden advice every player will tell you. It is not the support's/jungler's job to ward, it is everyone's. Unless you are left with &lt;75 gold after buying a couple items ALWAYS buy at least one sight ward. It is literally the same amount of gold as 5 creeps and it can help you tremendously. If the other mid laner is any good he will try to get his jungler to gank you just like you are trying to get your jungler to gank him. By warding you can see the enemy jungler coming and be in a much safer position. Later into the game, if you see there is no ward at baron, pick one up and place it there. I have been in quite a few games thrown because there was no ward at baron. Many people will rage at the support for not putting one there but that is not the case. You should have seen that there was no ward and YOU should have put on there.

**Call MIAs**

The other mid laner is also looking to roam around and kill of side lanes, so if you don't see him in lane? Ping the river and tell your team that he's missing. If you are confident in your map awareness you can also notice other MIAs in side lanes call those too. The more aware you can make your teammates the better of a chance they will have in surviving ganks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now That You Are Ahead, How Do You Carry?**

**Roam**

This is very, very important in ""carrying"" games. People always complain about the whole ""win lane, lose game"" dilemma that they are faced with. Realize that you are only one out of 10 people on the map. If four of the members on the opposing team win their lanes and you win yours, you will definitely still lose. As your job as a high burst champion you are responsible for roaming during the laning phase. You can do this at all times, but I generally recommend at least having your ultimate as it tends to do the highest amount of damage on mid laners. If your opponent backs, push the lane up to turret, and now you have 30 seconds to roam. Look at the top and bottom lanes to see if either of these lanes can be ganked. If either of the opposing champions are overextended? Gank. Is the opposing champion(s) low enough that you can 1 shot them safely? Gank. Are they pushing tower while your bottom/top lane are at base? Come in and force them off of the tower, while also picking up some nice exp/gold. I am generally out of lane more than I am in lane after 10 minutes in. The more you are around the map (while still getting all the exp/gold you can mid lane) the better. This will help your other lanes win their lane and you will have a much stronger late game and therefore a much better chance at winning.

**Team Fighting**

Team fights are what win and lose games, especially as death timers go up. If the enemy team is losing everything, but they win a big team fight? They are back in the game. So what is your job as a mid laner? It varies from one champ to another but for the most part, your job is to destroy the most valuable target. This most valuable target is almost always the ADC: the glass cannon of the enemy team. Unless they are extremely far behind they can stand in the back and poke at your team all day, so you need to get to the ADC, kill him instantly, and get the hell out before you are focused. Once the ADC or most valuable target (usually the most farmed target) is gone do what you can without dying. For the rest of the team fight just hit the enemy with what you can and try to pick off any low health targets.

**Be A Leader and Communicate**

You are better than the other Bronze players right? Well your team won't know this if you stay quiet. You guys just won a team fight? Awesome, ping the most vulnerable tower and take it down. The bottom opposing ADC just died and you see their jungler top lane? Ping the Dragon and get your ADC/Support to help you finish it off. Do you see that their team is spread out late game? Get your team to group up and pick off stray enemies and then push an objective. Are they all headed to Baron while you guys have no vision and the enemy team is still strong? Warning ping the shit out of the Baron Pit and tell your team to get out. Never be a dick about things and lead by example. Your teammates will follow your lead and will gain the confidence needed to win the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is by no means the best way to play Mid, as I am only in Silver. But I know, with confidence, how to get out of Bronze and how to win Bronze games. Follow everything in this guide and you won't have to worry about winning your lane and losing the game, because you just won your lane, your bot lane, your top lane, and the game.

I'm writing an article on champion power spikes and i'd like your help as i'm not familiar with the power of all the champions. I'm specifically trying to look at when a champion will be strong in both their leveling and their item builds.

I realise a lot of this article is ""once champion X gets Y ability and Z item"" because that is when they gain actual power. But i'd like to try and make it a little specific for ceratin champions and when they might be likely to kill you or end up stronger than you are.

I realise this is an opinion based article as i'm not going to do the DPS maths behind every character but it might be useful for people to see when they should be fighting with their characters and when they should be wary of other characters.

Examples:

**Riven, Power Spike at levels 2, 3, 6.** Riven is a potent duelist with just 2 of her abilities and one of the strongest with all 3 abilities. Her ult is very dangerous and she will be looking to all-in you around level 6.

Riven gains a lot power from Bloodthirster and when she starts to amass some cooldown reduction.

**Jayce, Power Spike at Levels 1, 2, 3.** Early game on Jayce isn't that strong due to mana constraints but he can put out a lot of damage in a burst combo. Jayce doesn't gain that large of a power spike at level 6 like most champions do, abuse this!

Jayce becomes very strong in lane once he has his Tear stacked enough that mana stops becoming an issue and once again his Manamune is complete.

**Jarvan, Power Spike at Levels 2 and 6.** Jarvan's damage is huge at level 2 and if he hits level 2 before you do then it is worth backing off a little to limit his combo. Killing power at level 6 is very strong if you don't have flash.

J4 tends to play in the jungle but gains a power spike from any early damage items he builds in lane including Doran's Blades.

**Ryze, Power spike at level 2 and 6.** Ryze isn't that strong early but can facilitate ganks as early as level 2 with Rune Prison. His ult isn't fantastically powerful in a duel but the spell vamp/move speed could easily catch you off guard.

He starts to really ramp up in power once he gets a few items such as a fully stacked Tear or Rod of Ages.

I've got a few more champions that I have mapped out myself, and i'll post those a little later, but i'd like to hear your opionions on champions I haven't listed as well as the ones I have.

Any suggestions that I use in the article will be creditted.

Thanks

**Edit:** I had a suggestion as to whether we could add a 'power rating' or something similar. If you'd like to include that then i'll try and add it into the article but if not try and add some explanation as to why you have the power spike.

So for example, if your character has a spike at levels 2, 6 and 9 then if you could mention what it is about those levels then it would help.


**Examples from posters**

**Rumble, 4 and 6.** Rumble is rather weak from lvl 1 -3. After getting a second point into his Q (Flamespitter) ability, his damage drastically increases. Also, he hits another powerspike at level 6 with his ultimate.

**Vladimir 6 and 9.** As most champions, Vladimir also gets a powerspike around level 6. However, at around level 9 when he maxes out his Q ability thus making him able to spam it very often, he becomes a real threat and unmovable pushing object

**Fizz, Power spike at level 2,3, and 6.** Fizz can trade really well at level 2 and easily get a kill with W and Q, even easier at 3 because he can use e to dive or escape. At level 6 the shark is a big spike of damage.

Lich bane is a huge source of damage because his Q applies on hit damage which works with W and lich bane.

**Cassiopeia, Power spikes at 2, 6, 9.** Without both her E and one of her poisons, Cassiopeia is rather weak. But once she gets both, she has the highest damage per second for AP casters. Avoid long fights. If Cassiopeia maxes her E at level 9, everyone should beware.

**Poppy, Power spikes at 2, 3, 6.** Poppy's power spike occurs whenever she picks up both her Q and E. Beware of walls after she does, because at any point in the game, getting charged into a wall will halve most target's HP. At level 6, beware of tower dives and Poppy charging in on multiple people with her ultimate on. (Also watch for her to grab Sheen, huge power spike whenever that happens.)

**Edit 2:** This seems to have taken off a bit. We're currently at 27 champions, so we've got a long way to go. If and when we get closer to all of the champions i'll write a list here to mention who we need or who needs expanding on. Thanks for everyone's help!

**Edit 3!** Up to 44 Champions at the moment. Any more we can Add?

Hey r/SummonerSchool! INA Aurelius here again with another guide for you all! Just trying to help out the general LoL community, help people learn and understand the fundamentals of League of Legends, cause League is a game based off entirely on game mechanics, i.e. DMG output, champion familiarity, game phases, objectives, etc., and to help the newbies out to the gaming scene. 

As you may remember me from my last guide, ""What we learn from Recommended Champions,"" this time, I'll be writing about How to play Mid Lane. 

 * If you haven't seen my last guide, you aught to check it out, for I believe it's a worthwhile read, here is the link below:

http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19e9tj/what_we_learn_from_recommended_champions/

To **clarify** on the point of this guide:

I'm writing it to help out anyone new to playing Mid Lane, anyone wanting to play Mid Lane, but is not quite sure on how to, and even people who main with a champion in Mid Lane and just wishes to get better at it. I hope you all enjoy this guide, as much as I do writing it, so I may, to the best of my knowledge, to explain what and what not to-do when playing Mid Lane.

**Mid Lane - The Basic Fundamentals**

 * **Your Role in the Team Composition** - Depending on whether you're playing as an AD mid laner or, more traditionally, an AP mid laner, your essential role 
in a 5v5 team composition is to be a primary source of whatever DMG you scale off of, whether that be AD or AP, which has given to the title for most mid laners ""AP Carry or Secondary AD Carry."" 

 * **Mid Laner's Positioning in Teamfights** - Although highly dependent on the situation and which champion you're playing, you, as a general squishy AP or AD carry, will want to stay within the back of the lines and use abilities to their fullest effect while kiting and staying out of the ""heart"" of the battle, i.e. where all the Bruisers, Tanks, and ""dive"" Assassins are. Remember that you offer the 2nd largest DMG output on your team, if things are about even, so surviving long enough to live up to that role is important.  

 * **Responsibilities as the Mid Laner** - This includes a wide variety of things such as:

 * Keeping up with what your enemy Mid Laner is doing, whether that be just going back to Base to buy, went through the river ramps to do Wraiths, went close to a bush to place a ward, etc.

 * Knowing where he/she is as well is just as important. Call MIAs often AND remember to Ping so that your allies are informed with it, for some people tend to not pay attention to the Chat. Better to be safe than sorry, guys. Also, 1 or 2 pings are enough. There's nothing more aggravating than someone who enjoys spamming pings. 

 * Your AND the enemy blue buff timers, you want any advantage that you can muster, so knowing the times for when yours or the enemy's is up may be a crucial factor in your success in a lane, e.g. if you know the enemy's blue spawn time and your Jungler goes out to steal the enemy's while you defend yours. 

 * Not only do you have the responsibility of keeping track of the enemy Mid Laner but as well as the enemy Jungler, for he/she will most likely, throughout the laning phase, be appearing in the Mid Lane to either cover the lane for his Mid Laner, or to gank you. Always note the position in which the enemy Jungler leaves and enters, and notify your teammates, e.g. ""Warning Ping"" type in chat ""Xin was Mid.""

 * Keeping up with your enemy Mid Laner's Summoner Spells and as well as Abilities, for it is most crucial information for your Jungler or anyone coming down to gank your lane, e.g. you may tell your jungler to come gank Mid since the enemy Katarina's Flash and E Shunpo are on CD.

 * **What Champions can be played in Mid Lane**

When you ask what champions can be played in mid lane, Riot would most likely say ""You can play anyone Mid Lane, cause we encourage to not have a meta."" Although this may be theoretically true, there are some champions that just don't belong in Mid Lane, e.g. Leona or Rammus mid?, so one might ask, what champions do? Since there are A LOT of champions, I'll do and explain a general breakdown of the **types** of champions, to the best of my knowledge, that can be played in Mid Lane. (Also, if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thanks ahead.)

 * *""All-In"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Katarina, Riven, Kayle, etc. This type of champion is very ""bursty"" in his/her combos, and generally have a kit aimed to allow him/her to make successful dives for you, when you're under your tower w/o much threat from tower-aggro, and get out unscathed thanks to either his/her resistances, high HP, or good escapes. The reasoning behind this is that Katarina has her E Shunpo to get out of ""sticky"" situations if she secures a kill, with Riven you have her fairly low CD E shield, to mitigate any DMG, plus her kit makes her very mobile, and with Kayle, her Ult and W allows her to ignore/mitigate DMG while making dives. 

 * *The ""Nukers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Annie, Malzahar, LeBlanc, Syndra, etc. This type of champion has some close similarities to the ""All-In"" Mid Laners in DMG output, but lack the kit to make ""safe"" tower dives. They generally rely on simply out-bursting you with his/her kit, much too fast for you to even respond to it. Although they generally have insane DMG output, they are regarded as the most squishy of all Mid Laners, due to their lack of resistances, escapes, and HP.

 * *The ""Teamfighters""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Morgana, Orianna, Zyra, etc. This type of champion is categorized for his/her amazing CC potential for teamfights. Although they may not be the best candidate for upfront 1v1s, they excel in their roles as an AP/AD Carry in teamfights thanks to his/her kit. They are also known for their zoning capabilities during laning phase, yet rarely dive an enemy underneath his/her tower for a kill, unless with the help of his/her jungler. 

 * *The ""Duelist""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Jarvan IV, Diana, Kayle, Zed, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her DPS potential and the general idea that he/she can take some punishment for a kill, i.e. tower diving, very aggressive zoning, etc. 

 * *The ""Roamers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Twisted Fate, Evelynn, Katarina, Nidalee, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to push his/her lane extremely quickly and then leave to go gank other lanes. They are best known for their highly successful ganking potential, e.g Twisted Fate's Destiny&gt;Gold Card or Katarina's Q&gt;E&gt;W&gt;R, that can help that particular lane ""snowball"" ahead the enemy laner. 

 * *The ""Secondary AD Carry""* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include ANY AD Carry. Although you may not see this as often as you used to during Season 1 and early Season 2, you may still stumble upon this type of Mid Laner. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to ""bully"" the enemy laner with just AAs thanks to his/her range. 

 * *The ""Play for Late"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Karthus, Anivia, Mordekaiser, Cassiopeia, etc. This type of champion is categorized by the simply idea that they do not need kills to be successful, although not-dying is important as well, relying on just ""farming for late game"" holds true in this type of champion's strategy. They are generally item dependent on their DMG, but are devastating once those items are acquired. 

 * *The ""Burst Assassins"" -  Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Talon, Katarina, Kha'Zix, Zed, etc. and are categorized for his/her massive DMG burst potential, i.e. the ability to ""insta-gib"" an important enemy from 100 to 0, before he/she can respond, in one full combo, AND as well as get out of the fight before he/she dies, which makes them similar to The Nukers, but different in the idea that they generally have some form of escape.

 * *The ""DPS AoE Assassins"" -  Some champions that fall into this category, (which may also fall into the other categories as well), may include Ahri, Talon, Katarina, Evelynn, etc. and are categorized for his/her amazing DPS AoE DMG potential in teamfights that deal a bit less DMG than that of Burst Assassins but in a more AoE field than singular field. Although they are almost all the same champions that fit the category of the Burst Assassins, the difference is that of builds, i.e. Burst Assassins will go for single targets, e.g. Katarina w/ DFG, while DPS AoE Assassins will build slighty more oriented to do DMG to the entire enemy team, e.g. Katarina with a Rhabadon's Deathcap. Are also known for his/her very low CD and high DMG abilities, Ahri's Q, Talon's W, Evelynn's Q, etc.

Those are the main categories, from my analysis, of all the types of champions that can be played in Mid Lane. Again,  if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thank you again.

**How does the Mid Lane laning phase differ from that of other lanes?**

The differences between Mid lane versus Top and/or Bot lane, include:

 * The distance of the enemy and allied towers from one another, i.e. allowing you to not run as far to escape a gank if you overextend, unlike that of Top or Bot. 

 * The distance of the towers behind the 1st tower, this makes farming behind the 1st tower difficult, if you wish to ""get ahead"" your enemy laner, since the tower ranges overlap one another. 

 * Bushes are placed on either side of you making ""bush-ganks"" less common for you if you play safely away from them. 

 * You have access to both sides of both jungles, allowing you to help your Jungler counter jungle, take your or your enemy's Wraith camps, etc., which means that a little responsibility is put upon you when it comes to the jungle since you have access to either. 

 * You have access to both entrances to the river, allowing you to gank either Top or Bot lane, helping that lane ""snowball"" ahead to victory. 

 * You are a Solo lane, meaning that you will generally be of higher levels than that of Bot lane and Jungle, have more gold, and more CS. 

 *  Your lane may be ganked more often than other lanes, due to it's convenient location of being the Middle of the map, so be wary of that. 

 * You have the responsibility, others too, but you mainly, of keeping and eye out for the following areas: Mid Lane mias, Purple and Blue side ramps to Wraiths, Side bushes, and (sometimes) enemy blue buff spawn times. 

**Ganking as a Mid Laner**

Ganking as a Mid Laner is sometimes risky, for if you die, you'll not only get behind on CS and gold, but may potentially snowball an enemy lane, so knowing when to gank as a Mid Laner is key. At least one of these criteria must be met (although not always) if you wish to go gank another lane: 
 
 * If you have pushed your lane to the enemy tower, you may consider leaving lane to go gank either Top or Bottom, or even to go counter jungle a bit.

 * If you've ""forced"" your enemy laner out of lane and back to Base. 

 * If you've been ganked by the enemy jungler and enemy mid laner and kill either one of them, with either the help of your jungler or by yourself, and have either enough pots to heal back up or just have enough HP left over to make a successful gank. 

 * If one of your teammates is forced to tower-hug AND the enemy laner of your teammate has no ward coverage as they overextend. 

 * If you have a large lead against the enemy mid laner and cannot be hurt much if you leave lane and miss CS and gold. 

 * Your enemy mid laner is missing or if you killed them and are ""healthy"" enough for a successful gank.  

*How-To Gank (tips)*

 * Ping that you are on your way, to catch you ally's attention.

 * Ask if any brush/river is warded. 

 * Wait for the perfect opportunity is which you can guarantee a kill, think before you do, patience is key to successful ganks.** (Special situation, read below)

 * Although, as stated in the previous guide's comment section, you should really only gank if you **know** something is about to happen, in which there will be a situation in which you can either guarantee a kill or save an ally's life **w/o** sacrificing yours, e.g. you saw the enemy Jungle walk through Mid Lane to go gank Top Lane, so you ""know"" something is going to happen soon. 

 * Learn to save your dashes/blinks/Flash/etc. for when the enemy uses his/her's. Most cases, if you play it correctly and depending on your kit, you won't need to use those and can save them for escaping during potential counter-ganks, or ""bad"" allied plays. 

 * Sometimes, giving up on a potential gank is better than ganking and letting your teammate die and the enemy laner escape. Know you DMG potential AND your teammate's DMG potential. Also, factor in how much HP our teammate has, how much HP the enemy laner has, the potential DMG output of the enemy laner, the location of th enemy jungler and mid laner. Remember, think before you do. ""Bad"" plays are generally made through poor decisions, which come from not thinking before he/she acts.

**The Importance of the Mid Lane tower**

 * The Mid lane towers are the most important among the ""Lane Towers,"" for it offers the team and the creeps the shortest route to the enemy base.

 * So having these down will definitely give you an advantage for if your creep wave is pushing into their base, then they either have to decide to teamfight you adn your team or go bak t go clear the wave, allowing you to get objectives, e.g Dragon, Baron, Buffs, other towers, etc., for almost free. 

 * ALTHOUGH, even though taking out the Mid Lane tower may give you and our team an advantage, it may be smarter to wait for a more opportune time to take it when you're at a higher level, i.e.  you need to save the tower so that you can receive creeps to far off of, cause if the enemy mid lane tower is gone, you might have to overextend to get any CS or gold, putting you in a very vulnerable position. Communicate with your teammates to ensure nobody is missing out before the first tower falls. 

**What should I start with when I go Mid Lane?**
 Your choices are:

 * *Boots &amp; 3x Pots* - This is may be a start for anyone who is up against any enemy champion that relies of skillshots for his/her DMG output, or you wish to roam early. I understand the idea that they were nerfed that 350 gold for 25 MS may seem not an efficient start. Regardless, the 3x HP Pots are a grace given to you for some sustain if you do happen to get hit by a skillshot. This start may be skipped if your Rune Page has 3x Quintessences of MS, but that is entirely up to you, remember, that extra MS might help you catch someone out of position, catch someone when invading during early game, dodge more skillshots, or outrun your opponent if you get caught. 

 * *9x HP Pots &amp; 2 Green Sight Wards* - This is a start that is taken when you are aiming to simply out sustain your opponent, allowing you to get an advantage on him.her in terms of Gold, CS, and levels. This is generally taken with champions that benefit from not having a mana Resource for his/her abilities, e.g. Katarina, Riven, Akali, etc., this does not have to limit the champions that do use mana for you can just simply trade in 4x HP Pots for 4x Mana Pots instead. Again, this is just for out-sustaining your opponent. 

 * *Cloth Armor &amp; 5x HP Pots - Although this is more commonly taken for Top Lanes or was taken for junglers back in Season 2, you may still take these starting items for Mid Lane if your opponent is AD heavy. It offers good sustain and resistances against any AD opponent. This is deemed a ""safe"" start if you are unaware of the enemy AD laner's skill with the champion, potential DMG output, and if you don't feel confident playing against this particular champion. and is also useful if you're an AP rushing a Seeker's Armguard against the AD heavy enemy team. 

 * *4x HP Pots &amp; 1x Fortitude Pot* - This is taken for only two reasons: One. You are planning to be excessively aggressive and are playing an AD champion, thanks to your starting items, you can be aggressive, deny the enemy laner from farm, while healing up on any trade backs, if any. 

 * *Doran's Ring or Doran's Blade* - These starting item allows you to stay in lane for a very long time, IF you are playing ""safe,"" meaning not overextending, harassing to deny CS from the enemy laner, staying behind your creep to avoid getting hit by skill shots, etc. An ok item to start with, if you only wish to farm and be passive, but does not offer the same bonuses as other starting items and vice-verse.

 * *Tome &amp; 1x HP/Mana Pot or Sword &amp; 2x HP Pots* - A poor choice, for the amount of AP/AD received is countered by the amount of sustain it provides you. You may take this if you are confident on the ability to out-DMG and out-sustain your enemy laner. 

 * *Crystalline Flask &amp; 1x HP/Mana Pot &amp; 1x Green Ward* - A very safe choice if you wish to either play safely and farm, or if you wish to zone ever so slightly w/o much worry for consuming too much Mana. The Flask is very cost efficient, so it is very helpful to pick up one. The ward ensures that you have a fair amount of vision throughout the early laning phase, in case of any ganks, etc.

 * *Fairy Charm &amp; 1x Green Ward &amp; 6x HP/Mana Pots* - To be taken if you wish to have a fair amount of Mana in your pool during trades, farming, etc., if you lack the ManaReg runes to help with your ManaReg, or you wish build against any AP enemy laner, e.g. it will build into Chalice. Offers a solid ground for building into other items and as well as a very large pool of ManaReg for out sustaining your enemy laner. May sometimes even out sustain those that start with 9x HP Pots &amp; 2x Green Wards if you have some SpellVamp.

**Masteries as the Mid Laner**

Depending on the specific champion you're playing in the Mid Lane and as well as your opponent, you may use one of these general Masteries sets:

 * **21/9/0** - This is a set for those that wish to either be aggressive throughout the game w/o sacrificing too much squishy-ness on your part if you are playing against another Mid Laner who has the same DMG potential as you. Would be recommended for those Mid Laners who's abilities or AAs put him/her in a melee position and are against anyone with ranged abilities, or if you simple benefit from the fact that you have no Resource to draw from, e.g. Katarina, Zed, etc., and do not need the 9 Points put into the Utility tree for added ManaReg or buff duration. 

 * **9/21/0** - This is a set either aimed at surviving what you determine will be a hard laning phase, or that you simply are playing a champion who has more than enough DMG potential to do well w/o the 21 points in Offense. **Remember** that Defensive stats always, always, or at least for the majority, beat out Offensive stats. This is most prevalent during early game, so keep that in mind during the Champion Select stage. 

 * **21/0/9** - This set is generally gear towards those Mid Laners that wish to dish out a large amount of DMG throughout the game and play aggressively with the help from the additional ManaReg and extended Blue Buff duration, e.g. Mana users, and sometimes Energy users for the bonus CDR.

 * **9/0/21** - This is a set in which is yet to be actually used widely throughout the game, for many people formulate it to be a weak set of Masteries, it may be, I'm currently in the process of testing it out, but regardless, this is a set for those Mid Laners who have a **huge** spike in either DMG potential or Kill potential once they hit Lvl 6, and their enemy Laner has yet to hit Lvl 6. This applies to certain champions that also excel at Roaming the map for kills, e.g. Twisted Fate w/ 9/0/21 masteries will hit Lvl 6 significantly much more faster than the enemy allowing him to gank any lane and snowball it or himself, e.g. Katarina w/ 9/0/21 masteries will hit Lvl 6 and use her Lvl 6 ult advantage to kill the enemy or other enemies since the others will be under her lvl and have an ult disadvantage. The added +3% MS helps with roaming and ganking. SpellVamp &amp; LifeSteal are an added bonus for a very small amount of sustain. Again, I state, I'm still trying these out, feel free to comment on them if you like.

1364649906.0,39,self.summonerschool,1bau2s,Every game I feel less and less like I can really influence things from the jungle,Sorry_Sweetheart,45,6,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1bau2s/every_game_i_feel_less_and_less_like_i_can_really/,"It's driving me crazy. I've played about 500 jungle games in my LoL career. I've hit gold 1 and am actually only one or two wins away from my promotion series into plat, and at times, things will go great. At other times I feel utterly helpless in turning around a losing game.

The other day, I was jungling Maokai and I went top for a gank at level 3. I initiated on the enemy Zed, and my Singed actually did a decent job of following up on this. Zed did get away with living shadow x2 + flash, but he was very low and had to go B. Singed was happy that we pushed him out of lane so early. Suddenly, I hear it.

&gt;FIRST BLOOD

&gt;ENEMY DOUBLE KILL

I look bot and notice that they were both killed by the enemy Miss Fortune. Following this,

&gt;AN ALLIE HAS BEEN SLAIN

I look mid and see that our Orianna died to Kennen and the enemy jungler Amumu.

OK, great. Now I have to go help the other two lanes. Bottom is two levels behind the enemy ADC at this point, but maybe we can make something work. I run down river and go try to help them, but when I initiate (after about five pings), my bot lane does nothing. The enemy MF has gotten enough space between her and my two bot laners that they can't catch up. I'm level 4 and the mid lane Kennen is already level 6.

So, I go clear my wraiths and wolves. I need to keep up in farm at least. Then, Orianna dies again. Bot lane dies again. Top lane is now getting camped by Amumu. Every single person on my team is complaining that I don't gank their lane.

**What am I supposed to do in this situation? I feel utterly powerless in helping a failing team as jungler.**

If I gank, I put myself at risk for dying because the enemies are fed and my lanes may or may not even react. If I farm, my teammates start with things like ""Amumu has come five times and you haven't even ganked my lane once."" The further ahead enemies get the more they're willing to invest in wards and the less willing my teammates are to invest in pink wards. If I spend my little gold on pink wards, I turn into a useless hunk of meat with a spirit stone and boots if I'm lucky.

When my teammates do great, I do great. We start tower diving and laughing about how hard we're winning, but that's mainly because my teammates were good, independent players who didn't even really need my help. I get fed, farmed, and start turning into an unstoppable killing machine. When my teammates do bad, I can do nothing. Maybe I can turn *one* lane around, but then what? I still have two other losing lanes.

There are two kinds of gap closer: dash and blink. A dash is something that moves you quickly through a space- Graves E, Nidalee jump, Tristana jump, Vayne q all count. There's also blinks- these are flash-type skills, rarer and better. Flash itself, Ezreal's thingy, Shaco's q- anything that puts you directly from one position to another, without mucking around in the middle.

The big difference between these is walls. With a dash, if the range of it is longer than the distance through the wall you're trying to traverse and you're close enough to the wall, you'll go through.

With a blink, as long as it's long enough to go just more than halfway through the wall, you'll get through. Almost everyone does this, perhaps inadvertently, with flash. It's important to know the range of any blinks you might have so you can know your maximum travelling distance. For the record, this works with wards as well- if you place them in the middle of a wall, they'll go to the nearest space that it's possible to ward, which is exactly how it works for blinks.

Additional differences: You can be hit in the middle of a dash by a skillshot or going through a trap such as Caitlyn's w or Veigar's e.

It has come to my attention some things that the average ""Summoner School"" player should have aren't even known about, and I'd like to do something about that. This guide will be learning how to improve yourself over time with all champions and roles you so desire, not learning to abuse specific mechanics which may not work when the meta slightly shifts or when you get above your previous ELO bracket of skill.

What am I talking about? It's a fair question, indeed. What I am talking about is tracking your progress both forward and backward over time as well as pacing your progress to be notably quicker even if your W/L isn't improving much or if you dont have much time to simply grind games for days until things sink into your head.

Let's share a story of a young football player, myself from the past. I'm a 5'2 140 lb person now, and I was at the time of my playing around the same weight all in fact and now I'm fairly lean. My highschool decided to play me as a lineman because I wasn't quick and I hadn't played a down of football in my life before I stepped onto the field. In fact I wouldn't play a down outside of special teams as a freshman because I wasn't strong enough. During the year I began to wrestle and lift weights with effective routines to raise my strength. By Sophomore year I was hitting similarly to the incoming freshman, a huge feat considering I could hardly bench 80 lbs before this ordeal of a year. My gains in strength were significant, adding nearly 70% to my previous strength rating where my peers adding ~15-30. Another year passed of the hard work ethic and I added another 40% gains of my strength, yes there are diminishing returns in the game of life. My peers, in general, added only~10%. By my senior year I was surpassing and caught up to some of the stronger players on the team. (My speed, however, wasn't quite...up to par)

My work ethic wouldn't have worked by playing a bunch of pick up football or simply playing for hours every day. It certainly would help and show me some of the things only experience gives a player in the game of football, but my strength, agility, and speed wouldn't improve without drilling in specific workouts to specific parts of my ""game"". This can be said about league as well.


In League, the only person you can rely to do well on is yourself in Solo Queue. It's a sad assumption, but one must make it until proved otherwise. What is the most viable way for the ""self"" to become a strong champion at all points in the game? Farming their minion waves or jungle effectively. Being an item ahead of your opponent in laning can be so devastating because of its passive that you end up winning lane really hard or going even in a normally bad lane for you. This is by simply last hitting all the minions. Kills aren't reliable and often you wont have the chance to get them unless the enemy isn't too smart (something I choose not to assume in soloqueue until proven otherwise). 

Everyone can use an item advantage. Everyone can improve their chances of getting an item to a determined science assuming they farm well. There is no question that around every 30 seconds after 1:30 there will be 6 or 7 minions to make gold with. Now it is up to the player to make 6 or 7 last hits. 

The first ten minutes of the game are crucial to farming. Not only will it be the only set aside time to farm, early items can be more devastating than my already exaggerated example. One must drill for the ten minutes so often with a champion that he will not lose a last hit if left to his own devices. You want it to be second nature, harassing more active but farming passive. Both are important, but you'll lose gold handed to you if you miss last hits. 

The process in doing this is simple. Go to a custom game with no bots/enemies, pick a champion, and go to a lane with NO skills and NO items. Learn their animation, learn their base MS/AD, learn how long the particle takes to travel to the minion, etc. Do this over...and over...and over...until you can almost perfectly cs. This will take ages to do. But it will significantly help your farm when the in-game scenarios come, especially under stress.


Mechanics are a huge part to this game and if you have 100% strong mechanics you will win a large percentage of your games for...ever? I dont know. Executing what you want to happen is difficult in practice but will take time to get used to. Use this type of focused practice as much as you can with people or by yourself. Wanna practice blitz pulls? go to bot lane with a friend playing an enemy adc practicing farm and see what percentage of pulls you land. Want to see timings and health values for different jungle routes? run the first couple clears on your own in customs. Wanna learn ANY champion better before going into queue with intent to play them? Play them in a bot lane and get comfortable with their skills. It takes time, dedication, and experience to learn champions to their fullest potentials. Just grinding games where you may or may not play your new champion is not going to effectively train you to play that champion. 

Second and much less obvious are the analysis of your decisions. 

League is a long game. Often you may not remember how first blood was scored unless you're the one who got it or how well top lane was farming by 50 minutes into a game stressing over a baron. You can analyze your choices in ""down time"" like going back to buy or by playing follow the leader or ""afk farming"", but this isn't optimal for several reasons. One, you could be thinking about decisions to make in the present/near future and not using your capacity to think that way. Two, there is a certain heat of the moment that comes over you sometimes to go all in or run in fear which is often misguided. Three, you can be over or under confident in your information depending on how the game has gone to a certain point without analyzing all the correct information.



Therefore, you should do your game analysis POST game.

There are tools to do so, including one I use on my own. I advise EVERYONE to visit and download 

http://www.leaguereplays.com/

It works simply in the background, and when you want to watch a replay you double click it. The power in this is the ability to watch yourself 100x over every game you play to see your tenancies. This is the STRONGEST tool in your kit to improvement, especially when experimenting with champions/item builds. It can amplify your effectiveness with new champions quickly and keep yourself from repeating bad behaviors! 

As a Starcraft 2 player, this feature built in is SO GOOD. It helps you figure out what the enemy was doing before they hit you like a truck and forced you to GG or to figure out weaknesses in your builds or their builds. I personally watch every game at least once, right after I play it.

I'd recommend everyone here to do the same, even if you zoom through it quick since league gamer are longer by time measurements often. During these watches of yourself playing...Ask questions of whys and why nots. Keep a notebook handy with pages for champions and roles, seeing what works consistently and what doesn't. No Solomid Guide is 100% correct for your elo, playstyle, or champion matchips. Its up to you to get that ""metagame"" information. 

When I watch a replay I always look for 3 good things, 3 bad things, and 3 things I want to change in the way I play. This keeps you positive and reactive. Maybe you repeat the good behavior, maybe you stop bad behavior, and maybe you're actively thinking of what you want to change in your plays next game. All of these coming together at once is what advances your play quickly, even only playing 2-3 games in a day. 

Finally, I want you guys to improve communication with yourself and other players to question each others logic. No one person can build an accurate depiction of how things work in League, and maybe that Philostone you buy early is better as a HoG or something. Who knows? Watching streams like TheOddOne (people who explain their reasoning) or chatting with locals who know the game well make a WORLD of understanding differences for you to execute your game. They can make your gold use more effective as well as push marginal advantages into larger and larger advantages. 

With these two formats of practice happening as a ""warm up"" and ""cool down"" to your league queueing experience, you will improve much quicker. Sure, it may not be the most fun or exciting, but you'll notice improvement immediately and improvement that sticks. You no longer push past river without wards lategame because you got caught in 5 games straight as different champs, and you didnt die because of that and that gold didnt go to the enemy team. All those advantages add up.

What I simply ask is to make League a routine much like any well trained athlete. You don't see professional football players play the game all day until their legs cannot hold them any longer. You see them rest, watch their ""replays"", train their mechanics and strength, and ultimately always improve. 

There is no benchmark onto how much or little time you spend doing these things or reading into them. You take as much as you feel neeeded, but spending 3 hours of League doing some last hit practice, 2 games, and replay watching can improve you so much quicker than maybe queueing for that 3rd game would be. That I can promise you, assuming you put in the time and effort.

Since we delete our threads after the cast, I wanted to give back to the community in the form of a weekly persistent thread that summarizes all of the lessons we learned in the week and simultaneously doubles as a Q&amp;A forum for our community and Summoner's School to exchange general ideas about the game. 



I'm a Gold IV Jungle and Support who teaches personal development and counsels RL. I play games between bronze and platinum level. While I'm far from a great player at League of Legends, I sincerely hope that my RL strategies for skill development and improvement will help the community in some small way. Thank you for giving me a chance to post here.



Please ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer them also.

**General Play / Improvement**



*Persistent Issues for General Improvement: Low Elo*



* Warding in different roles. As a jungle main I noticed a major problem in my games was a lack of map coverage. While support knows to buy Sightstone, they often don't ward consistently. Our map coverage improved when I bought a ward every time I went back. Pink wards are now very cost effective, rewarding 30 gold for a reveal + ward kill. This makes the price of a pink ward 95g (125-30) and is negligibly higher than green wards.  I just did better when I warded more, but this is especially true for jungle. 
* As a front line initiator in jungle, you cannot necessary rely on team follow up. Often times with Vi, Hecarim, or Jarvan at low Elo I'll initiate but my team will run away. You can make more calls and politely explain with pings what you're trying to do and I found that this often helps. ""Initiating as soon as I get a chance on Caitlyn, I'll CC her down"" followed by green and assist pings made a big difference here.
* Early Oracles as jungle or even support can make a big difference in the early / mid game. Since oracles persists through death now, jungle can get it to stop an aggressively warding bot / top / mid lane and make it nearly worth it (at 30 gold a kill) and really create a huge fear effect in the game because no one knows where you're coming from. This is big for psychological lane presence and made a big difference in our games.

*Persistent Issues for General Improvement: All Elo*



* Taking responsibility for focus or protection in engagements. If your carry is fed, we did better if we peeled for them. If the enemy was fed, we did better if we dived them and zoned from the fight. Understanding priorities by who is stronger was extremely important in our games.
* In high burst lanes (like against a Caitlyn) buying early pink wards as support helped a lot to prevent damage and get ahead. 
* As jungle, knowing when you could get away with stealing a buff and when you can't. Often times I knew a ward was down on an enemy red but I went anyway, costing a flash or even a death. If there's a chance you can't make a play in the early game, giving up your buffs is too risky and it's better to farm.
* Generally speaking, warding offensively (in their jungle, wraiths, wolf entry) when ahead and warding defensively (in your jungle) when behind was game changing. Identifying as support what your team needs from your warding helps win at any Elo.




**Attitude / Skill Development Fixes**




* For each game, we tried keeping a list of notes containing 1-3 mistakes and then worked the next game on improving them. It really made an immense change and mistakes were easier to correct over time.



* As always, polite interaction (or barring that, no interaction) didn't set people off and kept people engaged in the game. Players quickly forget about transgressions if you just say ""sorry"" mute, and keep playing. Toxicity loses games and while this is a general practice on our cast to do this - it's really important.




Overall, the most important lessons this week were all in warding. Whether it be warding more as jungle, warding critical objectives, or offensive/defense warding as support (see above.)

Jax was doing really well and Cass and I were doing decent. 

We started to fall behind and were on the defensive. I started farming up both jungle and any lane that was free, while ganking for Cass. Jax didn't need it and Ezreal was basically a lost cause dying in bot solo. At like 15 mins Ezreal went afk at fountain expecting a surrender. Eventually 20 minutes came, but they hadn't even gotten an inhibitor yet. When the vote came up both Cass and I voted no. The three of us defended and farmed. Every time they tried to poke us they overextended because we actually were outleveling them and catching people solo. Eventually Talon came back and Ezreal decided to play again.

1368841742.0,36,self.summonerschool,1ejzo1,Would there be any interest in a diamond support player going over how various lane matchups should be played? Example video inside.,protoges,44,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ejzo1/would_there_be_any_interest_in_a_diamond_support/,"Hello.

Like the title said, I was wondering if there'd be any interest in a series of videos that looks at some of the various matchups in bot lane from the support's point of view.  A friend ended up spectating a game of mine and asking how I did well as nami/ezreal vs leona/draven as he (and I, to be honest) expected us to get rolled with their higher damage and innate tankiness.

Instead of just typing out what I thought and how I played the matchup as I've done in the past when friends asked, I thought I'd make a video.  It not only lets me specifically discuss my positioning in lane, my ability use, and other things but also lets others see it if they are interested in seeing it.  While the video focuses on laning, I also have a few clips of teamfights later in the game to look at positioning and spell usage there.

If you have any specific questions, are interested in me continuing with this sort of thing and making more videos with other matchups, and/or have any constructive criticism on what I could have done better let me know here (preferably) or in the youtube comments.

However, in practice (and this is bronze so take it with a grain of salt) if someone loses their lane early then the enemy doesn't even bother trying to get that farm.  Now they have two junglers, one to counter jungle yours and get farm that way (and deny farm to him) and one to get their own jungle farm and both of them can put pressure on the remaining lanes.

Your team ends up being pressured hard in their lanes and here you are, all by yourself, farming up your lane alone while the rest of your team is getting beat to hell.

But the other option is to push the waves out and get all the farm you can that way, except then you're deep in THEIR lane and are easy to gank with no tower to fall back on.

Not really expecting to find help or validation from this – just an observation from my experience with the current system. In a nutshell: 

- I’m a Silver 1 jungler – I have belonged here for a while (150+ games in this league)
- I have recently began improving to a point where I can carry / snowball the other lanes on a fairly consistent basis
- Recently, I have been on a tear losing 1 for every 4 or 5 wins (and that’s being conservative)
- When I win, I gain 2-3 points a win. When I lose, I lose 5-6 points on average. Last night I lost a game and randomly lost 15 points

I don’t know what to do. I understand my focus should be on playing better in general and not just what league I’m in – but I HAVE been and I  HAVE gotten better – however how can I move up if for every streak I go on, all of my progress is erased by 1-2 losses (1 of which typically involves a DC or a troll, etc). I know this happens because that’s the systems way of saying I belong in Silver 1 right? Do I really not belong in Gold V unless I can win 15 in a row without losing? Should I just play a lower lvl account? I’m at a loss and it is becoming so demoralizing to win and win and win for DAYS only to be knocked down 20 pts in 2 losses when it took me 10 STRAIGHT wins to get there.

Anyway, like I said – I guess I’m just ranting because I love the game but hate how the system is working for me at the moment. I’ve read a million of these posts but always thought I would eventually overcome it to move up – I can’t play flawlessly and win 15 in a row though…. And apparently that’s what it will take for me to move up at this point

1363367433.0,35,self.summonerschool,1acy3h,A Short Note on Runes (Unofficial Guide),romanticpanda,46,11,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1acy3h/a_short_note_on_runes_unofficial_guide/,"Lately I've seen a lot of questions on runes in Summoner School. I'll try to answer some of those questions here.

**Who am I** 

I'm a Platinum 3 player who peaked at 1550 elo S2 and stopped playing ranked (having gotten my Victorious Janna :P). I'm a toplane and support main. Both of these roles have highly specialized rune pages (I have 3 support pages and 4 toplane pages), so I know what I'm talking about. That said, feel free to point out any mistakes and I'll be sure to correct them.

**What are runes?**

Runes are enhancements that players can buy to boost their stats in-game. They are permanent and carry over from game to game, so long as you enable the runepage containing them before the game begins.

**Why buy runes?**

The bonus stats that runes provide are invaluable to your early game. A Tier 3 flat AD runepage with AD reds and quints, armor yellows and MR blues gives about 900g worth of stats at level 1 (calculated using cloth armor, long sword and null magic mantle as references). That's a huge edge that you have over your opponent when you get to lane, allowing you to bully them with ease.

**When to buy runes?**

If you're a new summoner who wants to try out runes, level 1 runes are cheap and very cost-efficient. The downside is that they're not as powerful as their T3 variants. When you outgrow them, they'll still be in your rune inventory, taking up space. They're pretty hard to get rid of (requires a bit of IP and time recombining runes to higher tiers in order to destroy them), but you can choose to leave them in your rune inventory as a nice reminder of the days when you were level 10 :3

For that reason, most players choose to hoard their IP for level 20 when they get access to T3 runes, the most powerful runes that everyone uses.

**When to use specific runes**

**Marks:**

Armor penetration: very rarely. Junglers can run 3 armor pen runes / 6 flat AD for fast jungle speed, but laners benefit more from flat AD.

Magic penetration: Any time you're playing a champion that relies on AP damage. 

Hybrid penetration: For hybrid bruisers that want to win lane early on. Kayle uses hybrid marks/quints pretty well, but I'd go with atk speed marks for higher dps.

Flat armor: For supports.

Flad AD: For ADCs, AD tops.

Atk speed: For junglers. 15% atk speed is huge for clearing jungle faster, especially if you built Madred's.

Armor pen: Junglers sometimes run 3 armor pen / 6 AD pages for full armor penetration on jungle creeps.

**Seals:**

Armor: Optimal in all lanes but mid, and only then if facing the standard AP mid.

Scaling HP/level: For mid champions that farm at range and 

Flat/Scaling Mana regen: For mid champions and some supports that need a bit of mana regen boost, like Sona and Lulu, who use their abilities often.

**Glyphs:**

Flat MR: optimal on midlaners and botlaners. Good for top lane and jungle too. Get this for a general AD/AP page.

Scaling MR: if you're in a lane vs. an AD bruiser or are jungling. Get this for toplane / jungle page.

CDR: For Janna only. Nobody else benefits from cdr as much as she does, with her clutch shields.

Scaling/Flat Mana Regen: If you're facing an all-AD comp or an AD mid, or if you're a hard counter to your opponent, get this.

**Quintessences:**

Flat AD: For AD champs, AD-scaling junglers and AD tops.

Flat AP: For all AP-scaling mids and tops.

Movement: Are you playing Ryze? Get one. Also good on junglers for faster ganks.

GP10: Supports should get 3 of these every game.

HP/5 Regen: I know most people don't get this, but I use this on Shen and Warwick to boost their sustain to incredible levels, allowing me to bully the lane.

Flat HP: Good on any tanky champion, particularly top laners like Shen who benefit from bonus HP.

Lifesteal: Very good on ADCs for the sustain, particularly if you plan to start with a Doran's Blade in lane. Get 1-2 of these if you plan to do so.

**Examples of Rune Pages:**

Standard AP Runepage, works for midlane/toplane: Mpen marks, armor seals, magic resist glyphs (either flat or scaling depending on what you're facing), flat AP quints.

Standard AD runepage: Flat AD marks, armor seals, magic resist(MR) glyphs, flat AD quints

Hybrid bruiser (Nidalee, Shen, Warwick, etc.): Hybrid marks, armor seals, MR glyphs, quints are up to you (AD for Nidalee top, HP for Shen, movespeed/atk speed for Warwick, etc.).

Sustain ADC: Flat AD marks, armor seals, MR glyphs, 2 lifesteal quints, 1 flat AD quint

Standard jungler: Atk speed marks, armor seals, MR glyphs, flat AD quint

Standard support: Armor marks, armor seals, MR glyphs, gp10 quints.


**Conclusion**:

There are lots of other pages that are out there that you could make for a variety of matchups and situations. What's important is that you think about the strengths and weaknesses of what you're playing, and try to optimize your laning phase so you can get the most farm possible, while being able to trade damage in lane. I hope this helped those of you who were wondering about runes! See you on the Fields of Justice!

Edit: As Takishan and BulletOnABiscuit mentioned, hybrid runes are really good in lane early game. The numbers look good on paper, but past level 3 or so they start falling off heavily. Champions passively gain armor per level, so for example, mid: your ""armor pen"" autos may hurt a bit but your overall trading dps will be lower than if you went for pure magic penetration as you build more AP items.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1363407178.0,,default,True,t3_1acy3h,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1acy3h/a_short_note_on_runes_unofficial_guide/,

I just broke gold (currently 1525) for the first time ever.  Gold was my original goal for myself at the beginning of Season 2, when I got sick of being unranked.  With a lot of help from Summoner School, I stepped my game up, got a lot of confidence, and plowed through solo queue.  I couldn't have done it without all the people who taught me, and just as much all the people I've taught - few things help you learn like teaching does.  In the 5 months since Summoner School was founded, I went from 1100 to 1525.  Upvotes for everybody!! =)

EDIT: Feel free to follow my [Elolog](http://elolog.net/public/e2fdabdb48) to watch me go!

Now for the learning!

You guys know me fairly well at this point for [being relentlessly positive](http://youtu.be/iCqwwTfXr1Q) and often refusing to surrender, [no matter what we're up against](http://youtu.be/XZVfHoTROgQ?t=55s).  I got a lot of that from dealing with the harsh ups and downs of poker.  Fun fact: I played online poker semi-seriously while I was in school, and did fairly well for myself.  The time I spent playing poker is among my most cherished, not only for the game itself, but for what it taught me as a person.

Poker and solo queue are very similar, in the sense that you have to deal with a whole lot of stuff that falls out of your control, and that you ride the highs and lows of the game at the same time as your personal play changes.  That's why there are a lot of poker players and LoL players alike who totally deserve better than their crappy bankroll/Elo - it's hard to tell what's your fault and what's not.

What you can take from both is a ""long run"" mentality - individual games will come and go, but the hard truth is that you're going to end up where you belong if you *just keep going*.  Stop thinking about your feeding teammates from last game.  Stop blaming bad luck.  **Luck does not matter if you put in enough hours**.  Of course, there's going to be a ton of luck that will carry you up and down, but that luck becomes weaker and weaker as you pile the games up.  Team feeding?  Whatever, this game's over.  Learn something from the time you have left, fight it out, and then move forward.

To keep this from becoming a 20-page autobiography, I'm going to dissolve the rest of my advice into a bunch of fragmented bullet points.

* Learn how to play from behind.  You're not going to win your lane every game, and your team is not going to win theirs every game.  You can come back from absurd early deficits if you know how - play safe, ward everything, farm like crazy, avoid fights, split push.  At the 40 minute mark, one death can throw the entire game - stall until late game and stop the snowball from rolling you over
* Do NOT play ranked if you're not focused, or at least prepared for the edge you give up as a result.  This includes being tired or hungry, in a bad mood about LoL or life, not warmed up, not listening to your favorite music, you name it.
* Practice your CS.  No seriously, practice your CS.  Go into a custom game and last hit for 10 minutes every day.  You will thank me when you outfarm every lane opponent.  When your farming is automatic, it leaves your concentration open to watch for ganks, force intelligent trades, etc.  If you have to concentrate really hard to keep your CS up, you're missing opportunities in lane.
* Know your playstyle.  Know how much you care about farming versus objectives, getting kills versus avoiding deaths, poking versus all-in fights, etc.  This will guide your champion choices as well as making you aware of how you need to adjust.  For example, I know that I'm a crazy aggressive laner, and I want to pick fights all the time - because I know this, I actively remind myself to calm down if I'm in a lane where I don't want to pick fights, or where I have a sustain advantage versus a damage advantage.
* Be the hero your team needs.  I don't mean champ select, I mean the personality on the team.  Some teams need a shot-caller.  Some teams need a mediator.  Some teams need somebody to keep the mood light.  If somebody is already doing one of these roles, help them out and do something different.  Be perceptive to how your team reacts - are they not listening to your shot-calling?  Stop calling the shots - it isn't helping and it's probably just annoying them (and you).
* Coordinate champ select.  Be that Summoner who immediately says ""this is the role I'm best at, these are the ones I can also play, let me know if that's okay!""  I open every single lobby with ""sup team =) [enter] I main ranged ad if that's okay, but I can be flexible as needed =)""  I immediately assign roles when people call them and ask the quiet ones if they're okay with what's left.  Give people what they want, and don't argue or be difficult when the 2nd pick who hasn't said anything instalocks a role that's been called - just say ""[Summoner 4] - are you okay taking top?""
* Defend the people getting trash talked.  Everybody knows when they screwed up and are losing the game - 90% of the time I'll immediately tell them not to worry about it, and maybe add a suggestion in the form of a question (""maybe try warding the tribush?"") to help them out.  Make them (and your team) feel like there's a solution to the problem, and a way to get around it.
* Learn when to go join a fight and when to push.  Know how fast you can take out a tower, and compare that to how long it takes you to walk to the next lane.  If you push a lane super hard and start whacking the tower, you'll either force somebody to come chase you (wasting their time while they're running and making the fight easier on your team) or you get a tower (750 global gold, which is ~2 kills + assists, plus map control).  Unless you know you're going to swing the tide of a teamfight in your favor, when you see that 3v3 brewing in the next lane, don't waste your time running over.  If you run over and aren't helpful, you just wasted gold/XP/map control - if you would've helped but didn't go, you will likely make up for the lost kills in tower gold.
* Bot inhibitor is IMPORTANT.  If bot inhibitor is down, that means you can stall for time and eventually your super minions will be at their nexus.  They will have to deal with that - meaning you can go take baron 5v4.
* When you're winning - win harder!  Except that doesn't mean BIG PLAYS WOOOOO - it means farming, pushing, clearing wards, and taking dragon/baron.  Stop taking risks when you're ahead, and be smart.

Im establishing this as a repository of information concerning SNS. If someone asks ""SNS? lolwut?"", point 'em here. This should answer any questions that they might have.

***QUESTION: WHAT IS SNS?***

*Answer: SNS (or Sunday Night Scrims) is a weekly event aimed at improving player skill while providing a platform for their performance to be broadcast to the general public. We have several games ranging in skill level from zero skill required to expert level that are played with each broadcast. The intent is to allow players (and viewers) to see how LoL is played at different Elo ranges/experience levels while providing competent feedback and commentary.*

***QUESTION: WHEN DOES THE BROADCAST START?***

*Answer: 4:30pm EST*

***QUESTION: DOES THAT MEAN THIS TAKES PLACE ON THE NORTH AMERICAN SERVER ONLY?***

*Answer: EUW is attempting to set up their own version right now. Keep posted to this subreddit for further news!.*

***QUESTION: WHERE CAN I WATCH THIS AT?***

*Answer: The Livestream can be view from [Own3d.tv](http://www.own3d.tv/SNSS). Videos of past events are available to watch directly from either [Own3d.tv](http://www.own3d.tv/SNSS) or [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/SundayNightScrims). Additionally, we are trying to prepare an all in one portal site to host all of this (and more) in one repository. In the mean time, you can also reference the sidebar for further info!*

***QUESTION: WHO IS THE BADASS THAT CAME UP WITH THIS?***

*Answer: Crazy Mofo 13*

***QUESTION: WHO'S THE ASSHOLE RUNNING IT NOW?***

*Answer: Gimp Samurai*

***QUESTION: WHERE CAN I SIGN UP TO PLAY OR SHOUTCAST?!***

*Answer: Check the sidebar! Our moderators apparently love this program! WOOOOOOOOOOO! Or, If you are seriously fucking lazy, you can sign-up to play [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFNIZDh2WmQ0RjVrN3c5c0lLbERXZkE6MQ#gid=0) and to shoutcast [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEwyMGlhUEFpaG9na2lpNjdlUnphOWc6MQ#gid=0).*

***QUESTION: WHEN SHOULD I SIGN UP?***

*Answer: NO EARLIER THAN WEDNESDAY OF EACH WEEK. I do not, and WILL NOT run a permanent roster. I erase the applications Tuesday night each week to allow for accurate attendance during the live broadcast. This means that if you sign up before Tuesday @ 11:59:59, your application is gone and you wont be in a match.*

***QUESTION: WHAT DOES THE SIGN UP PERIOD END?***

*Answer: Usually Saturday morning. I wake up and spend about 4 hours putting the schedule together, after which I post it to reddit. Anyone who applies after that will most likely not make the schedule. However, if you have applied a few weeks in a row and have not received an opportunity to play, send me a PM on reddit, and we can work something out.*

***QUESTION: IF I SIGN UP, ARE THERE ANY REQUIRMENTS?***

*Answer: Yes. You* ***MUST*** *have mumble installed and configured before you enter the game lobby. If you dont have a mic that is fine, but your ability to hear your team mates is crucial. Check the sidebar for all relevent information on the r/ss mumble server. Or be fucking lazy and [CLICK HERE](http://redd.it/tawix).*  

***QUESTION: IS THIS SHOW FAMILY FRIENDLY?***

*Answer: Depends on if you/your kids have sensitive ears or not. I work maintenance in the military... I have a great vocabulary, and zero filter. I dont give a shit if little Timmy hears me let the f-bomb machine fly. If you do, maybe you should put on some headphones.*

Firstly, I am truly overwhelmed with the amount of support this has had. Really really impressed with the turnout and how useful everyone is being! Thank you for volunteering to teach and to be taught.

Secondly,  I want to implement a basic tagging system, so that its easy to tell what the post is about at a glance. Could we start adding [TEACHER], [STUDENT], [GUIDE], [DISCUSSION], [WANTHELP] to the posts? Should streamline everything a little bit.

wingedserpent has already added our lovely [Summoner](http://i.imgur.com/cmoTi.png) mascot to the header, created by user Retromation. There is now similar flair as is on the main LoL subreddit, you can add your ingame name and server.  
  
Me and debenoprma are updating the epic spreadsheet as quickly as possible, please be patient, we will get to everyone. In the meantime, check that your details are correct, if we can add anything to specialisations or you speak any other languages, message the mods with [Speadsheet Update] in the subject box. Also, if you are going to volunteer, take a look at the spreadsheet and try to give us all of those details right away, makes our job much easier.

We have plans to start various groups and get beginner nights going, but will be busy with other things for a little while. In the meantime, I am appointing cobrophy as head of this particular idea. You can view his submission and join up to his list [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/ntoxs/summoner_school_night/).  
  
If you have any ideas about something to do, do not be afraid to make a post about it or to offend the mods, we are pretty laid back at this stage, and very willing for the community to get involved in organisation. If we have any real problems with it we will have a word, but I do not see this problem coming up.  
  
The chat room 'Summoner School' is active in game, so pop in there for more spontaneous encounters.  
  
All this in just a day... I can't wait to see what happens in a week :D

* Lane ganks vs river ganks
* Offensive ganks vs defensive ganks

**Lane Ganks vs River Ganks**

What is a lane gank? That is when the jungler comes directly to the lane without entering the river.

When would you do a lane game? Typically you wait until the lane is pushed so that you can get into the lane brush without being seen.

What is a river gank? This is your standard gank. You come from the river and try to get behind the enemy to block off their retreat.

When would you do a river gank? Typically you wait until the lane is pushed so that you can catch the enemy off guard. Make special note of what allies tell you about ward placement.

**Defensive Ganks vs Offensive Ganks**

Defensive or offensive ganks can be either lane ganks or river ganks. The difference between offensive ganks and defensive ganks is the objective. 

A defensive gank is done to protect an ally and scare the enemy, but generally will not net you a kill. This is important to note, because you do not want to overcommit to a gank where getting a kill is not the objective. Your main objective is to get the enemy to use something with a long CD (ultimate or summoner spells). A defensive gank is used when the lane you are ganking is behind. Too often the jungler will come to a lane that is behind and go on the offensive only to get him and the lane killed.

An offensive gank, the one people generally think of, is primarily geared towards getting a kill. A secondary objective is to get the enemy to use a summoner or ultimate (similar to a defensive gank). Often a jungler will gank to get the enemy to use flash and then ""leave"" only to immediately gank again to secure the kill.

For those that have made it this far, I hope you have learned something and that the trolls stay far away.

This is another post for the weekly round-up thread summarizing everything I've learned in the support and jungle roles over the course of a week running a live cast with the objective of learning and climbing Elo. 

After every game I take notes and write down what I can improve on and this thread is a summary of those notes in a pretty easy-to-read format. I hope someone gets something out of it. This might be really obvious stuff to high Elo players but is still very relevant to me.


**Support**


* Most important of all support lessons this week was I learned I have to constantly buy green and pink wards in addition to sightstone at all Elos. At low Elo, your team won't ward with you but this has been critical for increasing my win percentage. It can't be stressed enough but each back, buy 2-3 wards in addition to sightstone to place in their jungle (ahead) or your jungle (behind.)
* I found you almost always want to have an oracles by about 20 minutes whether ahead or behind. This is another step in superior map control. If you are behind you have to try very hard to clear wards from your jungle so people don't get caught and you can get ahead. If you're ahead then you want to clear their wards from baron, dragon, and their jungle to secure objectives.
* Sometimes picking a support just for counters in lane is inferior to picking a support that works better with your team composition. Planning for mid-game to late-game team fights, for example - picking Lulu into a Malphite composition just for that synergy, has been working well for me.
* You can skip philosopher stone in lane and not hurt too much if you rush sightstone instead. If I don't need sustain in lane (Nami / Vayne for example) I usually skip it now.
* I really like buying boots of mobility most games on most supports now to help clear wards / place wards and still get back into lane to maintain exp gain.

These basics have helped me a lot so far. Onto jungle!

**Jungle**



* Picks are very dependent on Elo. I've found carry junglers like Lee Sin, Vi, and Nocturne to be very effective through bronze and silver but I have a lot more trouble in gold/platinum with them and find tank-support junglers like Maokai, Jarvan, etc to be more successful.
* Builds are also very dependent on Elo. In a bronze game last night I went 7-0 Jarvan IV but we lost because I built straight tank (golem -&gt; randuins -&gt; etc) however in a gold/platinum game I was doing this and it was completely fine.
* Important team fight decision making dependent on diving their carry (they're very ahead) or protecting my own (our carry is ahead) has helped win games. Before entering the team fight phase make a conscious decision based on the number of kills the carries have on each side whether to dive their carry or protect yours.
* Don't stay in lane on low-level ganks too long because their jungler can turn on you and the worst and most morale-breaking thing for me has been level 3 deaths / giving double buffs in lane. Conversely you can turn this same concept on their jungle and effectively counter, especially in level 3 top lane ganks.
* I have found my level keeps more consistent if I spend much more time farming and only gank when I am fairly certain I can get a kill. In jungle I always try to prioritize doing ""something"" instead of wandering from lane to lane - and wandering between river or through fog should be a conscious decision to get to a very important objective - otherwise farming is a better choice.



As for some general notes, I'm currently debating which role should get Locket, Jungle / Support - I don't know if Jungle will favor it for very long because the personal stats are reduced quite a bit as a result of 3.10. At the same time, with how much I have to ward in gold/platinum, the time it would take to build a full locket is substantial. We're still having a debate in the channel about this.

I appreciate Summoner School allowing me to post here and for everyone who has checked us out and gone back and forth. I hope this thread is of use to someone and helpful.

For my grade 11 anthropology/sociology/psychology class we had to make a survey relating to a thesis. 

The thesis topic is related to video games and how it effects job/school performence and I'm looking for people to do my group's survey. 

It's about a 2 minute survey, [here](http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=5h6s2cysdp5gxwj152252), please answer honestly; skip any questions that you are unable to or are uncomfortable answering. After finishing the survey feel free to close the ad window, its just there because we can't afford the membership. 

Thanks

(edit): I can post results after I finish the project. If anyone is interested

This is because of his ridiculous passive. I posted this as a comment somewhere else, but its really interesting how much damage Taric can do. 

-------------------------------------------------

**Muramane** [gives](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Muramana)+1000 Mana, Damage equal to 2% of max mana, and an active that gives ""damage with single target, non-periodic spells or your basic attacks will consume 3% of your current mana to deal 6% of your current mana as physical damage""

**Taric** [mana](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Taric) at lvl 18 is 1263 and his AD is 116. His passive ""autoattacks deal bonus magic damage equal to 2% of his maximum mana. This bonus damage is doubled against champions.

Base Damage: 116 AD + (1263 Mana) 50.52 = 166.52 mixed damage

With Muramane Mana: 116 AD + (2263 Mana) 90.52 = 206.52 mixed damage

With Muramane Mana and Passive: 116 AD + (2263 Mana) 135.78 = 251.78 mixed damage

With Muramane Mana, Passive, and Active: 116 AD + (2263 Mana) 135.78 + (6% of current mana, assumed to be full) 135.78 = 387.56 mixed damage


----------------------------------------

Throw in [Iceborn Gauntlet](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Iceborn_Gauntlet) and you get 116 AD + 165.78 Passive + 165.78 Muramane + 145 Sheen Proc = 592.56 Mixed damage

If Taric's ult is up, the damage total is *750.06 per hit* [\(+70 AD from ultimate I think\)](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Taric/Ability_Details)

At this point, with 2 items and boots, you are free to build full tank. 

----------------------------

***tl;dr: No items, no runes, Taric with Muramane and active damage does 387.56 mixed damage per hit.***

I'm gonna just get this out of the way now.  Yes, I agree that sometimes, I come off as generally unapproachable or grouchy, or just like an asshole.  This has been a failing point of mine for a long time.  But, something was mentioned to me earlier today that I've been sort of pondering on and off.

&gt;...you get put in the position of being a role model and a spokesperson and as a result are judged more harshly for your words and attitude.

Whether this is actually true, as far as the role model part goes, I am a spokesman for SNS in the very least, and my behavior as a Mumble administrator and the SNS guy is severely lacking.  So, in the very least, I'm going to make an effort to be more approachable and less of an argumentative fuck in the near future.  To anyone that's actually had a problem with my behavior in the past, maybe we can work it out over real fruit smoothies.  Sorry about that.

I understand that there'll be a certain level of bullshit-calling on this, and I almost expect some people to continue to provoke me just to see what they can get away with.  That shit will continue to not fly, but by and large, I'll do what I can to be a bit more open to communication and conversation.

Hi everyone! With Rengar's addition to the League of ~~Draven~~ Legends, I'd feel like now would be a great time to talk about the real monster in the jungle, Cho'gath.

Cho'gath is underated in the jungle in my opinion, with 3 AOE abilities, a great ult for securing buffs, awesome sustain, and decent ganks if you get used to his style. He also has a variety of build paths and routes, and is not too gold reliant. While good, he's hindered by unreliable CC, highish mana costs, and bad dueling before 6. In this guide, we'll take advantage of his natural strengths, while minimizing the effect of his downsides.

&gt;**Pre-Game Setup**

* If you're not a big spender and don't like Robots or Gentlemen, Jurassic Cho'gath is pretty bitchin'.

* For runes, Armor Seals are a must, as always. MS quints help with clear speed and ganking, so I recommend them as well. For Reds I run AS for more Vorpal Spike procs, and I run my standard scaling MR Blues. You can change it up as you need to, but I find that this set-up is pretty awesome.

* Cho'gath can do well with any mastery page setup, but I prefer 9/21/0 (9 in AD or AP, doesn't matter) if I'm going for a bruiser route, or 0/21/9 if I'm going for more tanky-initiator. 0/9/21 also does well for this purpose, but I find I'm too squishy.

* Summoner Spells are Flash and Smite. While Exhaust+Smite works too, having Flash provides so much more utility. Cho'gath can easily jungle without Smite too, but if you do, I will punch you through the internet. Jungling without Smite is just plain silly.

&gt;**Starting and Early Game**

* For starting items, Cho'gath has such great sustain, you don't need to invest in Cloth+5. I prefer Boots+3, and occasionally, Regrowth+1.

* When it comes to routes, Cho'gath has tons of variety as well. I normally go Wolves-&gt;Blue-&gt;Wratihs-&gt;Wolves-&gt;Red-&gt;Golems. You can start red, then take blue, start red and gank, it's hard to find a route that's bad for Cho.

* Start with E, then take Q if ganking, or W if clearing. Skill order will be discussed in a bit.

&gt;**Items and Skills**

* Cho'gath has tons of item paths. This should mean that you should focus on building for your team, or against the enemies. If you're going tanky-CC Cho, items like Aegis, FoN, and Randuin's are great picks. Bruiser Cho would involve items like Abyssal, Kage's and Wit's End. Good all around items are Frozen Heart, Shurelia's, or really any utility items. Just know that on Cho, CDR is amazing, and resistances+his health gain from feast make him unkillable.

* You can level his skills very diversely too. If I'm going to be ganking tons, and the laners have good CC, I'll level my W first for the silence, making my Q almost unavoidable. If I need clear speed and more Deeps, leveling E is the way to go. I almost always max Q last, as only the damage increases, but if you're having a stompy game, or wanna do more damage, max it second. Personally, I love ganking as him, and go E-Q-W-E, R&gt;W&gt;E&gt;Q, taking my ult whenever I can.

&gt;**Useful Tips and Tidbits**

* Don't lead in with Q unless you are 100% sure it is undodgable. Having the laner lead in with CC, plus your silence or slow from red buff, makes your Q a Garen-teed hit.

* Once you get your ult, try to get to max stacks ASAP. While this is common knowledge, know that it's CD is around a minute at level 1 with little CDR. Your ult also does decent true damage to both champions AND minions, so if a fight or objective is coming up, save it to secure the buff or kill.

* Like I said, CDR is amazing on Cho. Having a Frozen Heart, Shurelia's, and even a Randuin's or DFG will let you potentially land an AOE stun/slow every 6 seconds. That's huge. With some AP items, you can turn that into pretty awesome teamfight damage.

* Know that your Q isn't just good CC, but also a great re-positioning tool. If Teemo is about to hop into his minefield in the river, making him re-route to avoid your Q may land you the kill, even if you don't hit it, as you effectively stopped him in his tracks.

* If you get caught in the jungle, you have decent damage, but can't duel someone like Shyvana, Lee, or Mundo. Use your Q+W to make a grand escape.

I hope I helped some people to jungle the Terror of the Void, if you have any questions, ask. I'll be on reddit and League tonight (and in the Summoner School chatroom), and if you wanna play, I'm going on a Cho'gath spree, so I'd be down to queue with some people.

1341942198.0,39,self.summonerschool,wc60y,How to help your Jungler,mcandre,43,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/wc60y/how_to_help_your_jungler/,"Your jungler would love to help you gank, but he has very special requirements. If these are not met, he can't successfully gank, and you'll be essentially playing 4v5, because he will be underleveled.

**Leashing**

Junglers can quickly get to level 2 by getting a red or blue buff. Some junglers are particularly good at stealing the enemy's buffs, and that's a good way to limit the enemy team's AP mid, because blue buff is crucial for mana regeneration. Regardless of whether your jungler goes for the enemy buff, or your team's own buff, he needs special care called ""leashing"".

The basic idea is to draw the neutral monsters' attacks to another player so that the jungler is free to attack without taking damage. There are many types of leashes, but the easiest one is the Simple Leash.

&gt; When the buff spawns at 1:55, hit it once, then immediately leave for your lane. If you continue hitting the monsters, you are usually doing a disservice to your team.

* Don't use multiple leashes! Monsters with multiple leashes will walk back and forth, resetting their health to maximum health, resulting in killing the jungler.
* If other team mates choose to guard the buff (good against counter jungling), make sure they know which one of them is leashing. As soon as it's time to kill the buff, only the jungler and leasher should remain.
* If you are leashing, don't continue hitting the monsters! You are leeching XP, Gold, and the buff itself. If the jungler says ""just hit it once and leave,"" then **HIT IT ONCE AND LEAVE!**

If you don't fuck up the leash, your jungler will be level 2, can unlock a second ability, and can get an easier early gank (esp. as Shaco).

**Ganking Lanes**

Laners don't always understand how jungling works. They feel entitled to ganks, even if the jungler is nowhere near their location. Here are some simple tips for siccing your jungler on a target.

* Continually chat with your team mates, notifying them of when opponents are missing from your lane, e.g. ""bot mia"". It's easier to gank 3v1 than 3v2.
* Notify your team mates when you see opponents use Summoner Spells (e.g. Flash, Ghost) and ultimate abilities. It's much easier to kill them when these are cooling down.
* Better than rushing in to kill your lane opponent yourself is to tease him back to your turret and attack him TOGETHER with your jungler.
* Talk with the jungler to decide which of two targets in a lane to kill. If you don't focus a target, the gank will likely fail.
* Stun/slow/crowd control the target so that you and the jungler have more time to damage it.
* Buy Sight Wards (75 gold) early and often, placing them in important areas such as the bushes by the river, or the bushes by your buffs, or the bushes by Dragon and Baron. This will help the jungler determine the situation better (Are you about to be counterganked?), and it will help yourself immensely, because you can then avoid *being* ganked, and can know when it's safe to push.

**Failed Ganks**

Ganks fail for many reasons. If your jungler fails to get a kill, or dies shortly afterward, it's not necessarily his fault. Sometimes you two are just unlucky, the target could have all his abilities up and ready, or the laner failed to provide sufficient conditions for success. Shrug it off, and try again later. Give your jungler the space to creep some more, and let him hit other lanes. If he tries to hit your lane soon after a failed gank, the enemy will see it coming, and will wreak havoc on your team.

The jungler does NOT have the responsibility of running to you whenever you demand it. If you fail to hold your lane, it's your fault, gg. You probably picked a poor choice for your lane, such as a champion with low sustain trying to solo top. Next time, think about team composition, not just champions you prefer to play. Stay back more, instead of being so aggressive, and buy Wards! Become a good laner and your jungler will love to help you secure kills.

**Successful Ganks**

Hooray, you worked together with your jungler to secure a kill! Now would be a good time to Recall, buy some items (Wards, Wards, Wards), and continue laning. If you two keep up the good work, you will be well leveled and built, able to crush your opponents.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1341942745.0,,,True,t3_wc60y,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/wc60y/how_to_help_your_jungler/,

Countering does have merits. If you find yourself in the above scenario but Vladimir has been your main for the past month, you will almost certainly win that lane.

While teaching a friend of mine how to play, I noticed that in the bot games we would play, everyone would go for kills. Kills were all they wanted, even resorting to tower diving or putting them in an unsafe situation to get a kill. I just want to scream at them sometimes.

League of Legends is *not* a ""Deathmatch"" game type. It is an *Objective* based one. Kills don't really matter. Instead of chasing that 150 HP draven under the tower to try to get that **one more hit**, turn on the tower instead. That's the main point of the game after all. :P 

I know this may be an intuitive part of the game, but because LoL was my first ever MOBA, I always thought that going for the kills was the most important thing.

It's fun (for you), worth trying if you're not in a serious game. 

You have a lot of damage level 1, so you can try to cheese an early lead. Otherwise, laning sucks, just try to survive. You have more range than the other supports, so you can poke a lot. Use your E to scout before warding. You can also scout the lane bushes to avoid a lane gank. 

I do 4/0/26 for the early cdr, R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E, get sightstone (necessary on all supports), mikael's, cdr boots. Get some more mana regen, max out cdr if you want. Spend the rest of the game spamming w and peeling for your carry.

At max cdr, your W is up every 2.4s. With mikael's and another mana regen item, you can spam w forever. Use it to waveclear, siege towers, chase, kite, scout bushes, impair positioning in team fights, and set up easy skill shots. I like to get SotEL for cheap damage, cdr, and more mana regen. With only SotEL at level 18, your W will do 260 damage before resistances, which is decent for such a safe and spammable spell. 

In team fights, sit in the back where it's safe because you're made of tissue paper. Ult is up every 48 seconds, so you can use it every fight to initiate or peel for your adc. Mikael's and shurelya's can protect your carry as well. E is up every 36 seconds, so feel free to use it whenever you need vision.

Give this a go and see what you think. Max CDR Ashe is kind of like blue ezreal, except you sacrifice damage and some safety for ungodly amounts of utility.

The Night Hunter

I'm going to attempt to teach you how to play Vayne as an ADC with this guide.

Vayne is an extremely powerful hypercarry, she has the highest uncounterable damage against tanks in the end game. While her early game may be weak, she skyrockets in power in mid game and only gets stronger as the game progresses. She's the best true adc at kiting (gtfo blue ezreal you don't count) due to her 2s CD dash + AA reset and invisibility. She also has a hard CC, which is rare for an ADC. I believe she has the highest outplaying potential out of any ADC in the game.

**Abilities**

&gt;**Passive**: Night Hunter

&gt;Vayne gains 30 movement speed when moving towards a visible enemy champion.

Extremely powerful when cleaning up fights or chasing in lane. Is amplified by her ult, which makes you move extremely fast. This passive is pretty clean and simple.

&gt;**Q**: Tumble RANGE: 300 COOLDOWN: 6 / 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 COST: 30 mana

&gt;BONUS PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% AD

&gt;Vayne quickly rolls toward the cursor's location, causing her next basic attack within 6 seconds to deal bonus damage. This ability resets the autoattack timer on cast.
The enhanced attack does not trigger against structures.

One of the abilities that makes vayne herself. It has the lowest cooldown of any dash on an ADC, and is highly abusable with her next ability to quickly proc the true damage the W provides. One thing to note is that the cooldown does not start until you use the bonus damage, so it may be worthwhile to autoattack something while running away from enemies so you can use it again. I max this ability first for the increased damage and lowered cooldown. Due to its low mana cost, you can use it to help you last hit under tower.

A  funny bit of information about her Q: Upon release, it increased the damage of your next attack by 55%, which made it stronger at level than it is now at level 5. 

&gt;**W**: Silver Bolts

&gt;TRUE DAMAGE: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8% target's maximum health)

&gt;Consecutive attacks and abilities mark Vayne's target with silver rings. The third consecutive attack or spell against the same target will consume the rings, dealing true damage equal to a flat amount plus a percentage of the target's maximum health (capped at 200 against monsters).
The rings are removed if Vayne attacks a different target or doesn't attack for 3 seconds.

This ability is extremely powerful against tanks late game, as you may notice. It has no cap, and as such can be seen doing 400+ damage to tanks. This is one of the reasons I prefer to go BotRK over Bloodthirster on Vayne. In lane, a quick combo if you just want to trade quickly is auto -&gt; tumble -&gt; condemn, which procs your silver bolts very quickly and ends the trade. I max this ability second for increased damage to tanks as I transition to the mid game.

&gt;**E**: Condemn RANGE: 650 COOLDOWN: 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 COST: 90 mana

&gt;PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 45 / 80 / 115 / 150 / 185 (+ 50% bonus AD)

&gt;MAXIMUM PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 90 / 160 / 230 / 300 / 370 (+ 100% bonus AD)

&gt;Vayne fires a projectile at target unit, dealing physical damage and knocking the target back 470 units. If the target is knocked into a wall, the target takes the same damage again and is stunned for 1.5 seconds. Condemn also applies Silver Bolts once.

This is perhaps the hardest part of Vayne to master. You have to know how far this will knock back (if they will hit the wall) and how their movement will affect the knockback. This ability single handedly gives her the potential to be the strongest dueling ADC in the game due to the stun. The range of this ability is slightly longer than her attack range. It's generally unwise to use this too much in the early game, it has a medium cooldown and costs a lot for Vayne's small mana pool.

&gt;**R**: Final Hour COOLDOWN: 70 COST: 80 mana

&gt;Vayne temporarily gains attack damage and enhances her other abilities. While Final Hour is active, Night Hunter's movement speed increase is tripled, and using Tumble stealths Vayne for 1 second.

&gt;DURATION: 8 / 10 / 12

&gt;BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE: 25 / 40 / 55

Extremely powerful ultimate. It allows you to chase nearly anyone down, and also provides you with almost 2k worth of gold in AD at level 16. The stealth also makes you hard to lock down in teamfights. The cooldown is static throughout all levels, don't be afraid to use it if you're about to start a fight. You could miss a kill because of it.

**Skill Order**:

I always max Q first for the decreased cooldown and increased damage. It allows you to chase extremely easily when combined with your passive. After that, I max W so you're destroying tanks in the mid game and E last.

**Starting Ability**:

If you invade you MAY want to start with E, I don't recommend taking anything until you have to because the CD on q is much shorter and it gives an auto attack reset, which may be more useful than the potential stun. Otherwise start Q. Never start with W.

**Runes**:

My personal rune set is:

9x AD marks
9x Armor Seals
5x MR/level glyphs
4x Flat MR glyps
1x AD quint
2x Lifesteal quints

Reasoning: The main goal of vayne is to farm, and this rune set allows you to last hit under tower easily and sustain throughout the laning phase.

**Masteries**:

Standard ADC: 21/9/0

This allows for you to put out as much damage as possible while taking defense for trading and surviviability. Take 4x health per level, 3x armor, 1x MR and flat hp if you're using cleanse, put the point in MR into the summoner spell mastery if you take barrier.

**Summoner Spells**:

Flash + Cleanse or Flash + Barrier

Flash is always an amazing spell for reasons you should already know. It has the most uses of any summoner spell; allows you to get away, chase, anything you want.

Cleanse can be used if you are confident in your ability to lane against the champion you are playing against, and barrier if you are not. Pretty clean and simple. Don't take cleanse if they don't have cleansable CC (Keep in mind suppresses and knockups are not cleansable).

**Builds**:

There are quite a few common builds on Vayne. My person build of choice will be the first one listed, and I will list other ones after that.

**My build**: Start Dorans -&gt; Bilgewater Cutlass + Berserker Greaves (get lifesteal first, then boot upgrades) -&gt; BotRK -&gt; Phantom Dancer -&gt; Last Whisper -&gt; Choice of Defense item (see below) -&gt; Infinity Edge. The reason I use this build is that I like having the attack speed early on for kiting + W procs.

**Build 2**: Everything is the same until you get to Botrk. Botrk -&gt; Infinity Edge -&gt; PD -&gt; Defense Item (see below) -&gt; Last Whisper. This build gives big damage early but is harder to kite with and requires a lot of money to get working. I don't like the lower attack speed; it feels off to me.

**Build 3**: Start Dorans -&gt; BF sword/Greaves -&gt; Vamp scepter/Greaves -&gt; BT/Greaves -&gt; PD -&gt; LW -&gt; Defense Item (see below) -&gt; Infinity Edge. I don't like this build, again because it lacks attack speed, and also the BotRK active which is extremely effective in lane and for kiting in teamfights.

**Build 4 (""The JaeWoong build"")**: Starts the same as my build up to Botrk. Botrk -&gt; PD/Shiv -&gt; PD -&gt; Defense -&gt; IE. I don't like this build because attack speed reductions REALLY hurt it, and thornmail has ridiculous effectiveness against it (your raw damage is extremely high, which is what thornmail thrives on).

Despite me talking down on the other two builds, they are all very workable and viable, and I would suggest trying all of them out to see which one suits you.

**Possible defense item options**: Guardian Angel, Warmogs, Randuin's Omen, Quicksilver Sash, Banshee's Veil

Guardian Angel: Get this when the enemy has a fed threat, but you feel that your team can clean them up if they're the only ones really threating you. Also very good against champions with reset abilities (such as kat or akali) and also against mordekaiser.

Warmogs: Not really good for much anymore, but I'd get it if I really felt none of the other items would do me any good (unlikely) or I was taking a lot of poke.

Randuin's Omen: As you may guess, best against heavy physical damage/AS divers such as irelia or vi. Active also helps with kiting.

Quicksilver sash: When you don't feel pressured very much and want to have the cleanse to be able to deal more damage. Also helpful if they only really have 1 person diving you and they're magic damage and have 1 form of cc. An important exception is Zed. QSS removes his death mark, I always buy QSS against Zed.

Banshee's Veil: Against heavy magic damage or strong initiatons like malphite. Try to keep the shield up as long as possible so you can block important spells in fights.

**Good supports**:

Lulu: She is good with everyone, she has a mixed bag of peel, lane poke, and cc. Ult keeps people off you and helps you survive in teamfights, as does W and Q.

Sona: Good healing power and good poke as well. Can set up for nice level 6 engages.

Alistar: Kind of cheesy, but can set up powerful stun combos.

Blitzcrank: Same as alistar

Thresh: Same as alistar/blitz, but with the added benefit of better peel + harass. Very strong if you aren't extremely worried about the enemy (and don't feel you need a heal/strong shield).

Janna: Good peel and strong shield. May be problematic if you need heals for strong poke lanes.

**Medium Supports**:

Soraka: If you really anticipate trouble in the lane phase, such as Sona + Draven, Soraka is a good choice just so you can survive.

Taric: After his nerfs, he's not as effective as he used to be. Not bad, not good, just meh.

Leona: Can be good, but will fall flat on her face if you lose engages. Risky pick.

**Matchups**:

**Support**:

*Hard*:

Leona: Tends to be paired with an aggressive adc that can all in you early rather easily. You can use your E to cancel her dash, but it's very difficult (the bolt has to hit her as she reaches you).

Sona: When paired with a poking support, you may be zoned rather easily. If you get soraka or some other strong healer, however, this matchup goes down to medium.

Lulu: Good poke and gives you problems when trying to chase later on. Lulu op.

Blitzcrank: Medium/hard since you have a dash, but if you get grabbed you will have issues.

*Medium*:

Alistar: His headbutt is cancelable with your e, if it hits him in any part of the headbutt it will cancel it. If he's running towards you use your e. If you get hit by a combo it can turn out poorly very quickly. However, you're one of the best ADCs to have against alistar since your true damage goes through his ultimate.

Thresh: Since you have a quick, low CD dash and his hook has a long windup, it tends to be less of an issue trying to dodge his hooks. His all in is good, though, and your e can actually cause you to get pulled farther if you knock him back as the hook hits you. Be careful, dodge hooks, and play for later on.

**ADC**:

*Impossible*:

Draven: He wins this lane at almost all points. Even in mid game dueling him is impossible without getting a stun. Farm and don't take auto attacks or he will dive you with ease. Watch out for the Draven Leona combo. He's getting nerfed soon and will hopefully be demoted into hard.

*Hard*:

Caitlyn: She can zone you rather easily early on. If you can get level 2 or 3 before her you can attempt to all in. You will most likely just burn their summoners, but that's worth it. If you get level 6 before them you should also probably all in as well. Try not to take free auto attacks.

Graves: Naturally tanky, naturally difficult to fight. He will get in your face and blast you. Hard to duel, but outplayable since his Q and ult are dodgeable if you predict them. If he's got a strong support be careful.

Varus: Similar to caitlyn, but I'd recommend taking cleanse for his ult because you can outduel him rather easily if your q is usable + you get a stun. Don't assume you're more powerful than him at any point though, he can turn around fights rather quickly if he lands an ult and you don't have cleanse or you didn't take it.

Urgot: Tends to be unpopular, but he counters pretty much everyone.

*Medium*:

Miss Fortune: More of a Medium-Hard, she just tends to be able to outduel you for a while unless you get stuns. I feel like she's somewhat similar to Varus, but without the hard CC (which is why she's below him).

Tristana: Hard to fight against, but your mid game blows hers away. All in her when her early game power is fading. Don't take free auto attacks early.

Ezreal: More of a Medium-Easy if you play it right, but he can outplay you as well. Don't facecheck brushes that he just went into unless he has ulted VERY recently. If you let him blindside you with his ult you will be in trouble. Otherwise, past level 6 you should be able to win straight fights, try to tumble dodge q's in exchanges and this match up will be a cakewalk.

**Early Game**:

Play passive and farm. The exceptions to this are level 2, 3 and 6. If you can manage to get the level before the enemy and they have 2 or so more minions to kill before they level up, take e and try to go for a stun. It can result in multiple burned summoner spells for the enemy or a first blood. Same tactic applies to level 3 and 6. However, NEVER engage a fight with draven unless you are sure you are ahead of him or can 2v1 him.

**Playstyle**:

Vayne is passive early, with slight chances to go aggressive. Don't worry if you don't get these chances, it's not a problem as you outscale pretty much everyone.

**Mid Game**:

This is when you start to shine. You're getting a few levels in W now and have your Botrk and maybe even your PD. Teamfights are brewing, or maybe you're shoving bot to abuse your insane 1v1 power to farm and take at least 2 bot turrets and farm up even more. Your goal in teamfights is just to kill whoever is closest to you. Tell your team to protect you, unless you did really poorly you should be able to outdamage the enemy AD.

**How to use condemn**:

Condemn can be used to cancel dashes in mid flight, such as Xin Zhao's Audacious Charge, or Jax's Leap Strike. Use this to your advantage, and cancel those abilities rather than use them after they're already on you. This can take some practice, but it's worth it.

**Late Game**:

This is where you truly shine. Your team should most definitely protect you because you will shred everyone and everything without any effort. Positioning is key, don't be afraid to attack the tanks, you're usually the only one who can kill them. Do whatever you can to not die, and don't wander around unwarded areas if there are missing enemies.

**Tips &amp; Tricks**:

* Buying a red pot can help early-mid all ins and let you win lane.

* Taking cleanse may make your lane harder, but will make you shine much more in teamfights. If you are confident in your ability to lane, try out cleanse.

* Tumbling into a wall will cause the auto attack reset to occur much sooner as it cancels the dash.

* Vayne is not easy to play. I recommend trying her in 10+ normal games before using her in ranked.

Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed the guide, and can put it to good use.

Make sure to point out anything I missed/you think is wrong. I'm always willing to answer questions, my IGN is Excited Soup on NA.

I'd like to thank MarcAurelius, I pretty much used his Ahri guide as a guideline.

I'd also like to thank leagueoflegendswikia.com, they provided all of the ability information.

Some edits done 6/24. (Added matchups section + another build)

Good luck, and happy hunting.

These changes slightly reduced Amumu’s burst damage and allow his opponents to spread out during team fights, avoiding all being locked down by Curse of the Sad Mummy.  

* Bandage Toss  
Damage reduced to 80/130/180/230/280 from 80/140/200/260/320
* Curse of the Sad Mummy  
Radius reduced to 550 from 600

**Ashe**  
As a classic ranged AD carry, we wanted to make her standout as a bigger late game threat.

* Attack Speed per level increased to 4% from 3.34%

**Darius**  
These changes reduce Darius’ ability to snowball during the laning phase while preserving his multi-kill chains of Noxian Guillotine in team fights.

* Noxian Guillotine  
When Noxian Guillotine kills the target, it can be recast within the next 12 seconds. This can occur multiple times in succession.  
Cooldown adjusted to 120/100/80 seconds from 100 at all ranks

**Fiddlesticks**  

* Several of Fiddlesticks' visual effects have been updated

**Garen**  
We’ve slightly reduced Garen’s resilience as he no longer gains bonus Armor and Magic Resist from his base stats. Garen will lose between 4-14 Armor and Magic Resist depending on his level.  

* Perseverance  
Heal amount reduced to 0.4% of maximum Health per second from 0.5%  

* Decisive Strike  
Fixed a bug where the cast time was faster than intended  

* Courage  
Passive adjusted to now increase bonus Armor and Magic Resist (from items, runes or masteries) by 20% instead of total Armor and Magic Resist by 20%  

* Demacian Justice  
Fixed a bug where the cast time was faster than intended

**Hecarim**  
These changes make Hecarim’s durability more consistent by smoothing out his early game jungle clear while reducing his late game survivability in team fights.  

* Rampage  
Damage increased to 60/95/130/165/200 from 50/85/120/155/190  

* Spirit of Dread  
Healing adjusted to 20% at all ranks from 10/15/20/25/30%  
Cooldown increased to 20/18.5/17/15.5/14 seconds from 14 at all ranks  
Fixed a bug where Spirit of Dread was stating it dealt more damage than it actually was

**Janna**  

* Monsoon  
Mana cost reduced to 100/150/200 from 150/225/300

**Kassadin**  

We’ve made Nether Blade consistent against all structures. As an already effective mobile assassin, Kassadin does not need unnecessary pushing power.  

* Nether Blade  
Fixed a bug where Kassadin's basic attacks with Nether Blade active triggered Muramana's active damage more than once  
Nether Blade's active no longer deals damage to inhibitors or the nexus  

**Kayle**  

These changes remove the least noticeable points of excess power on Kayle’s kit. To increase Reckoning’s immediate impact, its slow is becoming stronger but now has a shorter duration.  

* No longer gains Magic Resist per level  
* Reckoning  
No longer amplifies damage while the target is slowed  
Now applies a stack of Holy Fervor to the target  
Slow duration reduced to 3 seconds from 4  
Slow amount adjusted to 35/40/45/50/55% from 35% at all ranks  
Missile Speed increased to 1500 from 1300  

**Nidalee**  

These changes clarify Cougar form’s intended strengths of high damage and high mobility rather than durability.  

* No longer gains Magic Resist per level  
* Swipe  
Ability Power ratio increased 0.6 from 0.4  
* Aspect of the Cougar  
No longer grants bonus Armor or Magic Resist  

**Renekton**  

* Ruthless Predator  
Fixed a bug where Ruthless Predator was unable to critically strike on any of the attacks; Ruthless Predator can now critically strike on the first attack  

**Taric**  

These changes provide opponents with early lane counterplay to Taric by reducing the amount of passive Armor granted by Shatter. In return, Taric is gaining meaningful ways to potentially scale into the later game, new itemization options and better ability to engage his opponents at close range.  

* Base Attack Damage reduced to 57 from 62  

* Gemcraft - Remade  
Taric's basic attacks deal bonus magic damage equal to 2% of his maximum Mana; this bonus damage is doubled against champions  

* Shatter    
Passive Armor aura adjusted to 12% of Taric's Armor from 10/15/20/25/30 (Taric's self-Armor bonus remains 10/15/20/25/30)  
Active damage now additionally scales with 30% of Taric's Armor  
Mana cost reduced to 50 at all ranks from 50/60/70/80/90  

* Dazzle  
Mana cost reduced to 75 from 95  

**Tristana**  

As with Ashe, we wanted to make her standout as a bigger late game threat.  

* Attack Speed per level increased to 4% from 3.01%  

**Tryndamere**  

These changes preserve the intended gameplay and counterplay of Bloodlust by forcing AP Tryndamere build up Fury before being able to fully take advantage of his heal. Using Bloodlust at 100 Fury will result in the same 1.5 AP ratio as before the patch.

* Bloodlust  
Ability Power ratio adjusted to 0.3 + 0.012 per Fury consumed (total 1.5 at maximum Fury) from 1.5  

**Vayne**  

These changes help alleviate some of the high pressure of playing Vayne by allowing her more liberal use of Tumble and Condemn.  

* Mana per level increased to 35 from 27  

* Tumble  
Mana cost reduced to 30 from 40  

**Vi**  
These changes reduce her early jungle presence by slowing down her clearing speed. We reintroduced counterplay to Vault Breaker by rewarding opponents for interrupting her while she is charging up.  

* Base Attack Damage reduced to 54 from 58  
* Vault Breaker  
Vault Breaker now goes on a 3 second cooldown and refunds 50% of the Mana cost when interrupted instead of fully refreshing the cooldown and refunding 100% of the Mana cost  

* Denting Blows  
Damage reduced to 4/5.5/7/8.5/10% of maximum Health from 6/7/8/9/10%

**Xin Zhao**  
These changes reduce Xin Zhao’s ability to stick to his target in early engagements and reduce his burst damage especially when building purely defensive items.  

* Audacious Charge  
Damage reduced to 70/105/140/175/210 from 70/110/150/190/230  
Cooldown increased to 14/13/12/11/10 seconds from 13/12/11/10/9  

* Crescent Sweep  
Base damage reduced to 75/175/275 from 125/225/325  
Cooldown increased to 120/110/100 seconds from 100/90/80  

**Zed**  
These changes differentiate Razor Shuriken as a higher risk, higher reward alternative to Shadow Slash.  

* Razor Shuriken  
Damage increased to 75/115/155/195/235 from 75/110/145/180/215  

* Shadow Slash  
Damage reduced to 60/90/120/150/180 from 60/95/130/165/200  

***Items***  

* Warmog's Armor  
Passive Health Regen reduced to 1% of maximum Health per 5 seconds from 1.5%

* Bilgewater Cutlass  
These changes make Bilgewater Cutlass a better early pickup for champions who want to utilize its UNIQUE Active.  
Recipe Changed: Long Sword + Vampiric Scepter + 200 gold = 1400 gold  
Attack Damage reduced to 25 from 40  
Life Steal increased to 12% from 10%  
UNIQUE Active damage decreased to 100 from 150  
UNIQUE Active slow reduced to 25% from 30%  
UNIQUE Active range increased to 500 from 400  
UNIQUE Active cooldown increased to 90 seconds from 60 seconds  

* Blade of the Ruined King  
These changes make Blade of the Ruined King a more universally useful item for Attack Damage champions and allow it to better fulfill its role in their arsenal as an item to combat high Health targets.  
Recipe Changed: Dagger + Dagger + Bilgewater Cutlass + 650 gold = 2850 gold  
Attack Damage reduced to 30 from 45  
Now grants 40% Attack Speed  
Life Steal increased to 15% from 10%  
UNIQUE Passive adjusted to ""Deals 5% of the target's current Health in bonus physical damage (max 90 damage vs. monsters and minions) on hit""  
UNIQUE Active changed to ""Deals 15% of target champion's maximum Health as physical damage (min. 100), heals for the same amount, and steals 30% of the target's Movement Speed for 4 seconds (60 second cooldown)""  
UNIQUE Active range increased to 500 from 400  

* Spirit of the Elder Lizard  
Incinerate damage reduced to 14-50 over 3 seconds from 15-66  

***Game UI***  
Players can now access 4 new pings in game through a radial menu  
""Enemy Missing"", ""On My Way"", ""Danger"", and ""Assist Me""  
Fixed a bug in which the tooltip for the item shop button would remain over the item shop once it opened  

***Spectator Mode***  
In Spectator Mode, the ping button on the minimap has been removed  

***Co-op vs AI***  
Retreat behavior on bots in Dominion Co-op vs AI has been improved  

***General***  
We made a bunch of quality of life improvements to passive on-attack effects so they’re no longer consumed when attacking wards  

Nami  
Tidecaller's Blessing is no longer consumed when attacking wards  
Thresh  
Death Sentence is no longer consumed when attacking wards  
Statikk Shiv  
Passive is no longer consumed when attacking wards  
Sheen  
Spellblade is no longer consumed when attacking wards  
Trinity Force  
Spellblade is no longer consumed when attacking wards  
Lichbane  
Spellblade is no longer consumed when attacking wards  
Iceborn Gauntlet  
Spellblade is no longer consumed when attacking wards  

Cursors in colorblind mode have been updated  
All red cursors have been recolored to orange  
The spellcasting cursor has been recolored to a lighter shade of blue  
LeaverBuster has been improved to account for client-related issues  
Fixed an issue that would cause some particles to be invisible for the duration of the match (ex: Nidalee spears, Dr. Mundo cleavers, Lux’s Lucent Singularity)  
Fixed an issue that would cause some spells to go on cooldown without casting when the target entered fog of war  
Health bars will now display thicker black lines for every 1000 health  
Enabling HUD animations now animates health and resource bars on the HUD.  
The death screen has been upgraded: Enemy and allied particles and champions will now retain light coloration while your champion is dead.  

With every patch, we strive to improve the look of the game in varying degrees. We recommend that you have the latest available video card drivers installed.

So, I thought I'd list off some things that I've learned in the past few levels just in case someone else hasn't figured them out yet.  

Please feel free to correct me and to list out the ones I'm missing.

Obvious things:

DON'T face check the bush (this means just walking in to it) if you're not ready to find a few enemy champs right there waiting for you.

It's more important to stay alive than almost anything else.

You should not always be pushing.  Most of the early game you should probably not be auto attacking.

Some champions can trade better than others.  Figure out if you can trade in your lane, and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Last hitting is about as important as champion killing.

Pay more attention to the mini-map.

If you don't see all the enemy champions, don't assume they are all back at base shopping.

**[CD](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cooldown)** - Cooldown. The time it takes to use the same spell again. Ex: at rank 1 Ashe's ultimate ""Enchanted Crystal Arrow"" has a base cooldown of 100 seconds. Therefore she can use the spell everyone 100 seconds. Each ability, regardless of its own cooldown, triggers a 1 second global cooldown.  
**[CDR](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cooldown_reduction)** - Cooldown Reduction. A champion stat that reduces cooldown. Ex: with a 20% cooldown reduction, Ashe's ""Enchanted Crystal Arrow"" will come up every 80 seconds instead of every 100 seconds at rank 1 (100 sec x 20% = 80 sec).

**FB** – First Blood. 100 extra gold earned by the player who gets FB.  
**FED** - When a champion is very strong compared to any other champion in the game. Note that being fed could be the result of out farming and/or being lucky/skillful in acquiring a few kills. Being fed does not necessarily mean that players were intentionally feeding that person.  
**FEED**(ing) - ""Feeding"" can result from either intentionally bad play or unintentional bad play. A person can play carelessly or recklessly and feed the enemy. A person can also choose to TROLL their team and intentionally die multiple times in order to strengthen the opposing team.     
**GANK** – Ambushing an enemy in order to kill them.  
**HEAVY** – see “BRUISER”  
**HUE** - Commonly seen as HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE. Can be roughly translated to mean ""I am currently dominating these enemy players! Huzzah brothers!""  
**Juke** - Moving your champion in ways your enemy doesn't expect in order to avoid damage. Ex: [Watch this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGovhDaPlXY)  
**KITE/KITING** - Typically refers to the combination of retreat and attack with the intention of maintaining distance from your enemies while continuing to damage them. Ashe's Frost Shot makes her exceptional at kiting.  
**KS** - Kill steal. To intentionally get the killing blow on an enemy champion when a teammate has done all the work to take them within kill range.  
**LANE** – There are 3 lanes on Summoner’s Rift. TOP, MID, &amp; BOT. These are the pathways that minios walk down and Turrets are located in.  
**LAST HIT** – Delivering the killing blow to a minion in order to earn gold.  
**LEASH** – Typically the person in the MID lane “leashes” BLUE for the jungler by attacking the large golem from the back side of the trees. This causes all 3 minions to attempt to walk around the trees in order to attack MID. During this time the jungler can be attacking the minions without taking any damage. This enables the jungler to kill them faster and take less damage. Leashing is almost always mandatory.  
**MIA** – Missing in action. “mia mid” means “the enemy who has been MID lane is missing, be careful”  
**MID** – The middle lane of the map.  
**MP** - Magic Penetration. The same thing as armor penetration, but the focus is on magic resistance not armor. Also affected by items, runes and/or masteries.  
**MS** – Movement Speed  
**[NASH/NASHOR](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Baron_Nashor)** - Baron Nashor. The most powerful jungle minion who gives the Exalted with Baron Nashor buff when killed.   
**ON-HIT** - An item, buff or skill that applies its effect once the champion attacks a target. Ex: Red Lizard buff applies a slow when the player attacks with it. Frozen Mallet has a chance to slow the target, and Ashe's Frost Arrow slows the target, all on the next attack.  
**OOM** – Out Of Mana. Typically used to let teammates know that you are unable to use Abilities and are therefore unable to attack or defend very well.    
**PULL** – Typically used in reference to Dragon. “Pulling” the Dragon out to the mouth of the cave allows teammates to attack the dragon from the river where they can easily escape/position themselves if enemies come. Pull the Dragon out by attacking it first and then moving back towards the blue golem camp. Don’t walk back too far or the Dragon will reset itself.   
**RANK** - refers to ""Spell Rank"". The number of skill points you have allocated to each of your champion's four skills (Q W E or R). For almost all champions, Q W E each have 5 ranks and R has 3.  
**RE** – “Returned”. Used to communicate that an enemy who had been MIA is now back in their lane.   
**RED** – Blessing of the Lizard Elder. Buff attained by killing the Red Golem or an enemy with it.  
**SNOWBALL** - This term is derived from the concept of a snowball rolling down a hill. As the snowball rolls more and more snow sticks to it and it becomes larger, more dangerous, and harder to stop. In League a player is considered to be ""snowballing"" if they are able to get a kill early and then use that advantage to get more kills which gives them a greater advantage which they can use to get even more kills and so on. Certain items can aid a player snowball due to their increased stats with each additional kill ex: Mejai's Soulstealer   
**SS** – Can be used to mean ""Stay Safe"" or as a synonym for ""MIA"".   
**STEALING XP** - Players can ""steal"" their jungler's XP by standing too close when jungle minions are killed. A mid lane player who is too close to the Wraiths when they care killed can steal some of their XP. This slows down the jungler's leveling and should always be avoided. Players who help leash or damage jungle minions at the beginning of the game can steal XP by staying around for too long and being within XP range when they die.  
**SUSTAIN** – Typically refers to a champion’s ability to stay in their lane for long periods of time from sufficient health and/or mana regeneration from abilities, runes, &amp; masteries.   
**TANK** (a turret) – “Tanking” a Turret means intentionally forcing an enemy Turret to attack you so that it doesn’t attack teammates. This can be achieved by being the first one into its range (when no allied minions are near) or being the first to attack an enemy champion when within Turret range.  More durable champions tank Turrets so that teammates can safely burst down enemies or the Turret itself.   
**TOP** – Top lane of the map.  
**TP** - Teleport. Spell that allows players to teleport to any friendly unit (non-champion). 300 Second base cooldown.  
**TROLL** - To intentionally aggravate players on either team with either: behaviour, champion choice, item builds or in game chat.   
**TURN** - The act of turning back on an enemy or enemies from whom you have been fleeing. ""Turning"" typically occurs after successfully baiting the enemy. You will never see this typed out because it is a split second decision but it is fairly common in voice chat.  
**VISION** – “Vision” is map visibility that is primarily attained through the use of wards and Clairvoyance.  A team with a lot of wards in place has “good vision”. A team with no wards has “no vision”.  
**WARD** - Items you buy at the Shop that grant you vision of an area for 3 minutes. Sight Wards are 75g, view 1100 range and last 3 minutes. Vision wards are 125g, view 1000 range, last 3 minutes and can see invisible things. The invisible things include: enemy champs, enemy wards, and enemy traps (such as Teemo mushrooms).  
**ZONE** - ""Zoning"" an enemy means pushing them back in their lane so that they are unable to CS. If you zone someone ""hard"" then you push them back so far that they are even missing experience.

Before a game of League of Legends, each player (referred to in-game as a **Summoner**) must select a **Champion**. Your champion is the in-game character that you control. As of the Ahri patch, there are 89 champions in the game.

There are some champions who do most of their damage by auto-attacking an enemy. An auto-attack is the most basic of damage-dealing methods, and is done by simply right-clicking on an enemy. Auto-attacks often scale off attack damage (more about that later). However, each champion has four abilities and a passive effect. When the game first starts, the champion has not yet learned any abilities. The summoner (you), must select which ability the champion is to learn by clicking on the (+) box above the desired ability. Each time the champion levels up (more about that later), it is allowed to level up one ability.

At level six, most champions will be able to level up his **Ultimate Ability (Ult)**. These abilities are generally very powerful, and should only be used when necessary. It is crucial to understand exactly what an ult does, and in what types of situations it should be used.

While a champion may fill many in-game roles, it is important to understand how abilities get stronger. There is, of course, the act of leveling abilities, which does make them stronger. However, a summoner may also choose to purchase **items** for his or her champion. These items can add to a number of stats for the champion, from health, to mana (the resource often used in casting abilities), to cooldown reduction (the time it takes for an ability to become available again). The two stats that most often increase the effectiveness of a champion’s ability to deal damage are **Attack Damage (AD)** and **Abilitiy Power (AP)**. 

Champions abilities often scale off of his or her total AD or AP. It is crucial to understand what abilities benefit from what stat. Generally, a champion whose abilities benefit from AD is referred to as an **AD Champion** while a champion who benefits more from AP is referred to as an **AP Champ**. Before playing a champion, mouse over each ability. Ability descriptions will state what an ability does, and explain how much damage or healing the ability will do. This is usually given in the form of “[flat number] (+ [green number or red number])”. If the number is parenthesis is green, it means that the abilities scales with ability power. If the number in the parentheses is red, it means the ability scales with attack damage.

Your champions ability power and attack damage, as well as their armor (the stat used for AD damage mitigation) and their magic resist (the stat used for AP damage mitigation) are listed next to the champion portrait in the bottom right of your screen. Mouse over each stat for an explanation. The character portrait can also be clicked for further information.

The order in which abilities are upgrade and items are purchased is referred to as a **build**. Different builds serve different purposes, and allow a champion to fill numerous in-game roles. There are many sites that offer builds for champions. However, when perusing these guides, it is important to not only understand *what* your build is, but also *why* it is being done that way.

The best way to learn a champion and how he works is simply by playing him. My rule of thumb has always been to play 3 bot games with a new champion (simply to learn the mechanics), then play as many normal games as possible with him. When you think you fully understand how each ability works with one another, check SoloMid.net or CLGaming.net for guides, and see try those builds in game.

1375494856.0,36,self.summonerschool,1jlqew,"LOW ELO Jungler's Pressure and LOW ELO Laner's ""NECESSITY"" for Ganks",jvanswut,42,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jlqew/low_elo_junglers_pressure_and_low_elo_laners/,"Disclaimer: this is the opinion of a regular, completely-not high elo player who is highlighting the general trend of negative behavior in low elo ranked solo queue.

In my experience of playing league of legends in low elo soloqueue, when a player in a lane matchup feels they are on the losing end of lane phase, he/she starts obsessively calling the jungler to gank. (asking for help is fine, but when it becomes toxic and negative...) Often it's at the disregard of general game knowledge a laner has to keep track of: ward placement/timing, cooldowns on summoners, lvl difference, positiion of the creepwave, and champion to champion interactions and attributes and possible countergank potential. Sometimes these players tend to show negative behavior: constantly nagging, flaming, verbally abusing the jungler and sometimes even afking or feeding intentionally. What these players tend to not realize is that the jungler may be making great plays and snowballing other lanes, securing objectives, and leading the team towards victory. In such case this exemplified losing-laner could have just played a little safer, fed less kills, gave up some cs and looked for opportunity to help the team in ways other than winning the lane. If in draft you have been countered in a lane matchup, or have picked INTO your counterpick (yes i've seen it done and these players realize they were countered even if they picked later than their lane opponent and just lose their minds..-.-):

-Play safe (dont trade if you know you're gonna lose, back off 1v3 or 1v2 dives at your own turret, let go of that one cs if taking it will mean an engage or a full harass combo from your opponent) IF YOU DIED IN A STUPID ACT ON YOUR PART, DONT DO IT AGAIN THINKING IT'LL WORK.

-Keep track of Flash/Ignite, summoner timers, how many pots &amp; flask charges your opponent may have left

-Invest in a pink (as koreans call it: Seduce your jungler with a pink ward)

-be knowledgeable about the lane matchup (INSTEAD OF WHINING IN CHAT THAT YOU WERE COUNTERED) and the opposing champion (the amount of cc skills a champion has, the availability of their gapclosing abilites, the bursting capability of the champion, possible damage over time, a power-spike or advantage due to leveling or itemization)

-WARD. To Korean SoloQueue players, not warding is ""equivalent"" to plotting treason against your country and stealing your best friend's girlfriend and they will call you the most horrific of things. Even Korean Bronze players don't think wards are a waste of money; you shouldn't either. If you're AHEAD, warding is EVEN MORE DESPERATELY IMPORTANT because your opponent is also being annoying and calling for ganks.

-BE AN OPPORTUNIST. improve mapawareness to react to favorable jungle skirmishes, objective contests, and possibility for global ultis (if you're shen, karthus, ezreal, draven etc). Sneakily KS-ing for some gold is good. Picking up some extra cs in a lane you came down to roam or gank is good. Picking up small jungle camps is good. Always look for ways to make money in places other than your lane if you're getting smashed.

-Mechanics ARE important even in a low elo game - dodging/landing skillshots, placements of aoe

-GAMESENSE AND DECISION MAKING ARE MORE IMPORTANT

-adapt your itemization to BUILD a little more defensively/utilitarian. NOT SAYING TO RUSH WARMOG ON EZREAL, but you should have enough knowledge of your and opponent's source of dps, availability of gold and your champions' synergy with certain items to have TWO build paths: one for when you are AHEAD/EVEN and one for when you are BEHIND.

-if you're being CAMPED, USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE - if you're for example top lane, you singlehandedly are drawing 2 people worth of map presssure up to top lane. Sometimes, IT MIGHT BE SMARTER to tell your teammates to pursue objectives or easier kills on the other parts of the map instead of constantly spamming your jungler to countergank.

-LEARN THE SYNERGY of 2v2. If you want your jungler to gank your lane with a potential of a counter gank, you have to be sure that your 2v2 will win. In this case you need to analyze the synergy between your champion and your junglers champion (ult combos, cc combos, dps output, jungler's buffs, level and HEALTH*-especially after clearning a big camp in the early levels)

-*EVEN IF, you are pushed to your turret and it seems like a favorable gank, be aware that if a huge minion wave is at your turret during a gank you WILL not only lose a significant portion of the minion cs but get DAMAGED by the minions over the course of the gank which can, depending on your opponents advantages over you, turn into a 1v2 doublekill for your opponent.

-GENERALLY, IF YOU SEEK TO WIN the GAME, your first priority should be to think of ANYTHING YOU YOURSELF can do on your own to WIN LANE 1v1 at any possible cost. You should also feel confident in your 1v1 or 2v2 trading abilities if you're planning on laning. (i've seen some players go into game with the mindset of ""I need a camp in my lane to win"" = Usually means you need to work on your fucking mechanics or you're a needy, dependent person and no one likes a needy person.

I am not the person to call jungle in every game. I'm a laner. But when I see laners abuse teammates and the jungler for uncontrollable variables (enemy camp) and/or for their own mistakes, I report the shit out of them and hope they never have children to never know the joy of family. 

TLDR; you're losing lane? Sometimes if it's your day a gank will come. but if it doesn't DONT BE A NEGATIVE DICKHEAD AND THINK OF WAYS TO HELP THE TEAM INSTEAD OF WHINING. ANALYZE THE MOVEMENTS YOUR JUNGLER MAKES TO SEE IF HE/SHE IS HELPING THE TEAM IN WAYS OTHER THAN WINNING YOUR LANE FOR YOU. STOP BEING A SELFISH TOXIC MOFO THAT SEEKS TO ENSLAVE YOUR JUNGLER.

""Oh crap"", I thought. I was playing Shaco jungle and I really needed to be aware of every ping and every little sound since I was planning to spend more time on Vi's jungle than on mine.

You know what? Because I had no sound at all, for every little creep I slained, I watched the minimap. Without hearing any ping I was able to see all MIA pings, all ""need help"" pings and all OMW pings. My fear of being caught deep on their jungle, early on, lead to a really really frequent look on the minimap... And it worked, it really did.

So, if you want to improve your map awareness, accept my tip and, for a couple of games, turn your sound off.



**tldr**: If you want to improve your map awareness, try and turn off the sound for a couple of games.

**Edit**: Don't forget that, if you turn your sound off, you'll miss some information like wether your skillshots hit someone in fog of war or not.

1370950547.0,36,self.summonerschool,1g44zq,Whose job is it anyway? #4: Objectives,lighthope,41,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1g44zq/whose_job_is_it_anyway_4_objectives/,"Whose job is it anyway? #4

Objectives are the primary way of winning the game. Sure you can force your enemy to surrender by killing them over and over again, but usually there are some objectives involved in a victory. However objectives are double edged swords and the risk is often as large as the reward. [This]( http://www.lyco.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/8/0/80295_01.jpg) is an objective, and we, the player, are the cute little bugs just waiting to get fried. Now when I talk about objectives, I primarily refer to turret, inhibitors, dragon, baron and the nexus, however blue/red buff can also be considered objectives, and can cause the same results as the other objectives. It’s important to never underestimate the risk of taking an objective!

* Red/blue buff:

The two buffs are primarily contested in the early and mid-game. It´s important to consider the position of the enemy laners and the enemy jungler when attempting to steal or contest an enemy buff. Having vision of the enemy laners allows you the time to react in case they move to stop you. In addition knowing the position of the enemy jungler is important. You need to know how many enemies you might be dealing with, optimally none. In soloQ it´s especially important to know how many people are moving towards you and where they are. It´s never worth it to steal a buff, and give up a kill for it. In addition to that, you should and must never expect your allies to come help you.

A good time to invade, is when all the enemies are in vision, either in a far away lane or on the other side of the jungle. Always think about how you are going to get out. Keep in mind, that there´s always at least one wall between you and freedom. Champions with high mobility are safer.

Late-game these buff are especially dangerous. People think they can easily steal a buff before leaving the enemy jungle, however they often get caught out, and risk throwing the game. NEVER TAKE A BUFF WITHOUT VISION OF THE JUNGLE ENTRANCES! Playing it safe and winning is always better than taking unnecessary risks.


* Dragon:

Like the jungle buffs dragon also peaks around the early to mid game. The reason is pretty simple. Dragon is easily accessible gold, however the risks can be high. During the early and mid-game, you oftentimes need multiple people to take dragon, and the amount of damage it deals is significant. This is why you see top teams immediately disengage dragon, if the enemy teams shows you to contest dragon. Having both the enemy team dealing damage to you along with dragon is too much of a disadvantage in a fight.

A good time take dragon is when you have a numbers advantage. This can be either after killing an enemy or when two or more enemies are in toplane. However keep in mind that high burst champs can perform cleanup duty if you get low from dragon. In addition champs like Ezreal or Lux or other high burst champs can steal dragon either from a far or with their burst. It´s important to always have smite available when starting of a dragon.

Having a pink ward to clear vision, and other wards in the area to give vision of incoming enemies. It´s always better to kill an enemy and then kill dragon, than to risks having it stolen. Losing multiple teammates is not worth it.


* Baron:

Baron is the biggest and shiniest objective on the map, however he also causes the most throws. Many people have said it before, and I shall repeat it. NEVER do baron unless it´s perfectly safe. If you are ahead, take it easy, play it safe, don’t try to take baron. Baron deals a lot of damage to your team, and you risk having it stolen or losing the following teamfight, and that is never worth it. Baron should be done, when you have vision of the enemy, and they're far away, you have enough damage to take down baron fast, and preferably when you have a numbers advantage. 

Making sure you have vision of the entire area around of baron is important. You want to be able to see the enemy arrive, and fend them off in time. The same rule that applies at dragon applies here. Kill the enemy first than baron. Of course finish of baron when he´s low is important for preventing a steal. However as you will see many top level teams do, disengaging baron when he´s too high HP is important, having both him and the enemy team damaging you is too much in a teamfight.

If a jungler comes in to attempt to steal baron too early, meaning before the baron is in smiterange, switch focus to the jungler. Killing the jungler will eliminate any chance for a smitesteal. It’s always better to eliminate the chance than to have the chance existing. Going up against jungler like Nunu or Cho’gath keeping in mind, that they can spike the baron down before your own jungler can, it’s important to take this into consideration. It’s always more dangerous to take baron against such a jungler.
 
A lot of teams will try to take baron after losing an inhibitor. Usually the other team isn´t ready for another fight and will have to go back. This is a good time to take baron, however you must never waste time. Even the smallest delay can result in a lost teamfight.
Having the numbers advantage isn´t always enough to take baron safely. One or two fed enemy champs can easily turn a safe baron into a lost game. Always keep that in mind. Having your own strong champ zoning the enemies away is an optimal way of defend a baron, as well as clearing the enemy vision from baron.

As a jungler, you should always keep smite available when baron is up. You never know when you are going to need it!
Preferably you want to finish a game without taking baron at all.


* Turrets:  

Taking turrets are usually a must for winning the game. When taking a turret you should look to have a numbers advantage and vision of the surrounding area, to prevent the enemy from ambushing you. In a 5v5 standoff you should never dive a turret unless you have significantly poked down the enemy team. The turret deals a lot of damage! Vision on the map allows you to take turrets safely, when you see an enemy some else on the map.

When contesting a turret you need to put damage on the turret safely. Usually the one damaging the turret will be the ADC, however he will then be putting himself in danger. It’s important to keep an eye on the enemy CC champs. Getting caught in front of a turret by enemy CC will mostly kill any ADC and potentially lose the game. Having a CC champ beside the ADC available for peeling is important for safely taking a turret.

Going up against good waveclear champs like Anivia you need to take the waveclear into consideration. As shown in the [match between clg.eu and M5]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGS3HkoBmes) waveclear can stall and even win a game. Knowing how strong your own waveclear is compared to the enemy waveclear is important for pushing down turrets. You can’t keep throwing yourself at a turret for 10 minutes.

 
* Inhibitors:

Compared to other objectives the inhibitor is the “safer” of the lot. The inhibitor itself doesn’t pose any threat to your team. For this reason any damage dealt to an inhibitor during a fight is wasted. You should always focus 100% on the fight rather than the inhibitor. You can always take the inhibitor after winning a fight. When you take down the baseturret and expose the inhibitor you don’t necessarily need to take it. It will continue to be exposed for the rest of the game. Falling back and getting ready for the next fight, is better than losing a fight after taking a turret.

* Nexus and nexus turrets (finishing the game):

A lot of times you see teams staying too long in the enemy base, just to take down a single nexusturret. This can at times lose a baron and even the game. There is no need for taking down a single extra turret, if u risk losing the game.  If the enemy team is respawning get out. Overstaying your welcome is a common method of throwing.

**TL;DR**: Be careful around objectives. Although they are the means to win the game, they are also the best way to throw a game. Taking big unnecessary risks are bad. Think your position in the game, and whether or not taking the risk is going to be worth it.

I recently started playing ranked and I definitely prefer that mode of play in general (people actually try to win most of the time, so good games are usually had) but I don't want to jump straight into ranked with a new champ. So after I bought Vi today, I played a bot game first to familiarize myself with her abilities and get a feel for the champ. I then proceeded into blind pick normals, since I can play jungle there 8/10 times without contest. Unfortunately, I haven't had a single blind pick game today that was even close to being a representative game. Every single lane loses hard with no or minimal enemy jungler involvement and I'm basically trying to pick up the pieces on 3 lanes at the same time and people basically just give up and stop trying completely. I've never seen anything even remotely like that situation in ranked, so I don't see how that's helpful champion practice at all (apart from the first ~10 minutes). The alternative, of course, is normal draft... but the ques are a lot longer, plus being able to actually play the role you want to practice is basically a 30% chance (max).",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,default,True,t3_197d80,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/197d80/practicing_champions_where_do_you_do_it/,

1352086052.0,31,self.summonerschool,12ncou,Countering is more than just a pick,dosukoi7,37,6,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/12ncou/countering_is_more_than_just_a_pick/,"
We've all had that game. Enemy team picks Fizz so Summoner 2 picks Ryze ""no worries guy lol gg hard counter"" and proceeds to feed and rage. Or the enemy FP's Morgana so Summoner 4 responds with a talon ""silence too stronk gg"" and is 0/4 by 3 minutes. 

I will admit that I too have failed by thinking that simply picking a counter to X champion will let me destroy my lane. One case in particluar I remember was I picked Renekton into Teemo. I got out farmed, killed, and generally threw the game for my entire team. The other 4 members of my team were relentless. ""How could you lose against Teemo as Renekton? nooblord go back to co op."" I too wondered what the heck happened, but it didn't quite click yet. 

 

A while ago I was playing a game, and I wanted to go Darius or Teemo top. Before I chose, the enemy chose Yorick. Well shoot, I thought, so I picked Cho'gath. The game starts and Yorick is playing extremely aggressive and I am losing the lane, but not dieing. ""What the heck, I should win this easily,"" I was thinking to myself when finally I said the most important thing to myself:
 
 

What is it that makes Chogath a counter to Yorick. I was about lvl 4 at the time doing my normal lvling or rupture, silence, spikes, spikes. So I thought, well, silence is one thing that gives chogath the advantage, so I should level that first. the other is the passive. I wasn't killing the ghouls for free health/mana, and that hurt my ability to stay in the lane. It should be obvious, but for whatever reason it slipped my mind.  
 
 

People often ask ""what's the best build for x champion"" and people always say ""it depends."" I have been playing for a long time, and I only ever really thought about this at the item level. Make sure that you think about what skill order will be best for you, and adjust your playstyle accordingly. 

 

This applies not only when you are countering the enemy champion, but also when you are being countered. If I pick Irelia and the enemy picks Jax, I will level Q or E over W for burst damage that can't be dodged. If I pick teemo and they pick a champion with a reliable gap closer, I will put some levels in move quick to counteract that. 


This has got kind of long and rambly, and maybe it's all common knowledge. I know it took me a while to figure out. This is my first moba game, so although I've been playing for about over 2 years, it was only really after about a year that I learned this kind of  stuff.

1343737868.0,32,self.summonerschool,xg23a,Welcome to the Irelia Zone. (Free week players look here!),ForteEXE,43,11,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/xg23a/welcome_to_the_irelia_zone_free_week_players_look/,"Well hello there. I see you are looking at **Irelia, the Will of the Blades**. Good choice. All the cool kids are doing it, don't worry, it'll be our little secret. What stays in R/SS Vegas, stays in R/SS Vegas.

Irelia is one of the chief examples of tanky DPS, as well as she is a semi-hybrid champion that focuses more on AD than AP (although she does have two skills that have AP modifiers). Typically Irelia is built tanky DPS and used as an initiator.

**Disclaimer:** I'm covering a non-Trinity Irelia build. Wickd (2k elo player and most famous Irelia player) and others favor Trinity Tank, I don't. Saying it now so there's no questions about it.

Pros:

* Naturally tanky as hell, and counterpicks a fair amount of popular solo tops, or at least can force a farm lane.

* Has three damage types, including true damage which is valuable against certain solo tops such as Malphite, and Poppy.

* Has a passive that reduces CC duration (and it stacks with masteries!)

* Is difficult to be forced to last hit under tower due to Q.

* Has a really cool set of blades.

Cons:

* Is VERY farm reliant and can be denied farm by certain solo tops. (who are also popular!) Unless you get fed early/allowed to farm unchecked, you are basically waiting until lategame to carry.

* Is melee, there are still an amount of ranged solo tops.

* Often gets focused first in a fight (this may not be a con depending on your team, to be honest) preventing you from dealing damage.

With that in mind, let us discuss Irelia more. Hold my hand, it'll be alright, we're off to Never Never Land.

For Runes and Masteries, I suggest the same that Dismemberedalive (1945 NA elo Irelia player) rolls with.

These would be:

* Armor Penetration Marks
* Flat Armor Seals
* Scaling Magic Resistance Blues
* Move Speed Quintessences

For masteries, he recommends 9/21/0, you can [view his guide](http://www.solomid.net/guides.php?g=3274) for the specific layout.

This runepage and mastery setup is designed to give Irelia some powerful early/midgame tankiness to hold her over until she builds items.

Let's talk about Irelia's skills:

Firstly, there's two ways to max her skills. I prefer **R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E** with an extra point in E at level 5. Some prefer **R&gt;W&gt;E&gt;Q**. The guide I mentioned above suggests R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E as well.

* Passive - Ionian Fervor: Reduces the duration of stuns, slows, taunts, fears, snares, immobilizes, blinds and silences for each nearby enemy champion.

    1 champion: 10%
    2 champions: 25%
    3 champions: 40%
    Diameter: 1200 (sight range) 

Does as it says it does. Stacks with Juggernaut and Mercury Treads, to be capped at 65% reduction. Only Trundle can achieve something similar.

* Q -   Bladesurge: Cost: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 mana

Cooldown: 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 seconds

Physical Damage: 20 / 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 (+1.0 per attack damage)

Cooldown: 14/ 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 (refreshes on last hit)

Irelia's gap closer and main source of AD damage aside from autoattacks. Of note is that it will process onhit attacks such as Sheen without you needing to activate the onhit first via another skill. This skill also returns 35 mana on a successful lasthit using Q.

* W - Hiten Style: True Damage: 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 75

Health Restored While Active: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26

Cooldown: 15 seconds

Irelia's main skill and what makes her so annoying to lane against most of the time. Also note that the active bonus for health restored is cut in half when the skill is on passive. This is what gives you the ability to put the fear of God into certain tops, such as Poppy (more on this in matchups)

* E - Equilibrium Strike: Cost: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana

Magic Damage: 80 / 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 (+0.5 per ability power)

Duration: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 second(s)

Cooldown: 8 seconds

Irelia's CC. This makes or breaks ganks. It's very much possible to, with this levelled up at least twice (for a rank 2 E) to turn a jungler gank on you into a doublekill for you and you walk away giggling. I very much recommend you have two ranks in this pre-9 for the CC power, as being able to slow/stun may mean the difference between you being dead, and you being fed.

* R - Transcendant Blades: Cooldown: 70 / 60 / 50 seconds

Physical Damage Per Blade: 80 / 120 / 160 (+0.5 per ability power) (+0.6 per bonus attack damage)

Maximum Physical Damage to one target: 320 / 480 / 640 (+2.0 per ability power) (+2.4 per bonus attack damage) 

Irelia's ultimate and source of healing outside Hiten Style. She heals for 25% of the damage dealt to champions, and 10% dealt to minions.

Build:

I prefer the tanky DPS Irelia, designed to get in, stay alive and massacre uncoordinated teams.

* Wriggle's Lantern
* Mercury Treads
* Wit's End
* Frozen Mallet
* Atma's Impaler
* Guardian Angel

This build is designed for all around tankiness, the ability to get a second life via GA, ability to stick to a target via Frozen Mallet's slow and high AD from the combination of Mallet and Atma. As well, you recieve extra MR and +42 magic damage from Wit's End, which combines with your Q and W to produce a lot of burst damage.

For spells, you want **Ignite** and **Flash**. Flash + E = gl catching/running from Irelia. Ignite ensures you have a killing option on top of your true damage. Not to mention the majority of tops (such as Vladimir or Yorick) with high sustain.

We've got the basics down, let's talk about matchups. Irelia is pretty much only played top, so let's talk top!

Please bear in mind these are matchups I've personally done. Newer ones such as Jayce, I haven't done. Somebody else will have to chime in.

**Matchups you win**:

* Gangplank (He has to rush a Giant's Belt or he won't kill you. His Q harass doesn't do much against Irelia with tanky runes and masteries, nor will his CC last long.)

* Kennen (Important: Start Null Mantle + 2 potions, you laugh at his stun. If he doesn't kill you before 5, he *never* will. You also can chase him down when he tries to E escape and burst him down harder than what he can sustain.)

* Talon (Talon has no business top anymore, Irelia is very good at educating him why. He can't handle her burst or damage, and his CC doesn't last long against her at all + she is naturally tanky and naturally builds armor early.)

* Poppy (Poppy fears anybody who throws down true damage, Irelia is one of the best to whip Smurfette with. Pop your true damage, dash onto her and hit her with E + autoattacks, ignite/ult to finish the job. Remember her passive does NOT work against true damage.)

**Tricky matchups:**

* Trundle (He has natural anti-CC, roids and is built tanky DPS + has sustain. He can pull a GP and rush a belt and completely screw you over. Take heart in that Trundle is rarely top these days.)

* Riven (One of the best definitions of a ""skill matchup"". I don't do this one often enough but know it requires you doing a LOT of baiting and attacking when her shield is on CD. She can run away better than you can however)

* Garen (He's fairly annoying early on with his Q and E spam, but if you rush armor, he should be fairly manageable. Be careful at 6 when he's trying to Spin and Win into Demacian Justice. If you think it's coming, back off, they usually try that E-&gt;R combo when their target's at 30-40% HP)

* Lee Sin (He has roids, sustain and a minishield among other CC. Get armor early and be prepared for a farm lane without ganks.)

* Cho'Gath (Honestly I think this is more of a farm lane than a really tricky one. He's naturally high HP and has some sustain. Irelia doesn't do so hot against tanks early.)

* Vladimir (You both have sustain, Vladimir gets annoying when he hits 9 and has Revolver/WOTA. You're bursty as hell, especially if you get your Wit's End early on top of Treads.)

* Swain (Ranged + Harasses you very easily. He's really easy to oom though, use that to your advantage. Swain has serious mana issues until he has Catalyst/Rod or Chalice/Athene's.)

* Malphite (This is going to be controversial. However with my build, you can counter his ASPD reduction, you have 3 damage types from W, autos and Wit's, Malphites almost always stack armor first before anything else, thus they have two resistance holes (and you can't resist true damage) you can exploit. Just be wary of his Q harass early on, and his dive when he hits 6.)

* Udyr (This really, really, depends on what skill order the Udyr takes. If he takes the right combo (which is Tiger and Turtle I believe) at 2, he wins the lane and probably kills you at 2. If he doesn't, congratulations, you've a better shot.)

* Kayle (Sorta want to move this to losing. Kayle is squishy and they almost always build glass cannon and/or like a carry. If you engage when her E is on cooldown, Kayle will regret going against you. Otherwise beware her Q + E harass, and when she hits 6, she WILL bait you into harassing with her ult.)

* Nasus (Really, this is just a farm lane. Do note Nasus players are ALWAYS building for lategame, use this to your advantage. Wit's End will help against his W harass. Get ganks early, Nasus players love to push with Q spam on minions.)

**Matchups you lose:**

* Darius (Let's face it, he's death for a lot of solo tops. You can't go in on him or he will 100-0 you with no sweat.)

* Yorick (Very very annoying, he can constantly spam ghouls on you and generally harass you to tower. Fortunately there's two factors here. 1) You have a lategame, he doesn't. 2) You can last hit under tower fairly well. Use these to your advantage, and get armor early on for his impending dives.)

* Olaf (He's packing more true damage than you do, he can ult to reduce your damage + ignore your CC and gets more dangerous the lower HP he has. You need ganks early on to pull ahead otherwise he can catch up and smack you around.)

* Akali (She wins early, you win late. Call for ganks, don't be afraid to drop pink wards to stop her shrouding, get MR early as well as HP. Akali hates people who rush MR and HP to stop her bursting. Akali is very vulnerable to being ganked if she can't hide in her shroud. She is also extremely squishy, most top Akalis have armor runes instead of HP/level.)

* Jax (He's burstier than you and can stun you if you stun him. Also can chase you and generally be a pain in your ass.)

* Rumble (He's going to be annoying until he gets his Q nerf in. Best bet is to play passive, avoid his E/R, attack when Q is on CD. Try to bait him into overheating himself so you get free attacks in. Call for ganks early, if you can get him dead 1-2 times before he gets belt or Revolver, you got a good chance.)

* Renekton (Same as Yorick really, he can harass you early on with nothing but CD timers to worry about. Also the same as Yorick, you have a lategame, he doesn't.)

**Tips and Tricks:**

* Farm farm farm early game. Your ult, Q and autoattacks make it very easy for you to farm up early.

* Your early game sucks until you get farm/kills. Get Razors early on. Getting Wriggle's shoots your sustain up silly high.

[Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/qym5z/how_do_i_lane_against_series_debut_this_week_riven/)

There are plenty of guides for how to play *as* champions, but there aren't that many guides on how to play *against* champions.  I'm starting this series (with plenty of room to guest post, since I definitely don't know all the champs =P) as a way to provide a basic primer on facing off against each champion.  I'll be planning on having one of these a week, probably for the rest of my life at the rate Riot is releasing champs.  Content will be reposted on [Summoner Academy](http://www.summoneracademy.com) within a day or so.

**Riven - The Exile**

[Abilities and Stats](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Riven), from the LoL Wiki.

* **Potential Roles**: Melee AD Carry, Tanky DPS, AD caster, gank-oriented AD jungler
* **Lanes**: Top, jungle
* **Common item choices**: Doran's Blade (stacking), Ninja Tabi/Merc Treads, Brutalizer, Bloodthirster, Guardian Angel, Frozen Mallet
* **Things to know**: Lots of short-range AOE CC, very strong early game, combo and passive does (ahem) tons of damage, very mobile, ult gives range and damage increase with big AOE finisher.
* **Beat her with**: safe early play, ranged attacks and targeted abilities, silence/blind/stun, stacking armor
* **Good counter choices**: Kennen, Rumble, Garen, Teemo, Nidalee, Malphite, Cho'Gath, Olaf

**Game Phases**

**Early Game**: Play safe and avoid her combo.  Don't be afraid to fall behind in CS to avoid getting killed.

**Mid Game**: Judge the situation to see if you can start trading with her.  Be very careful about her teamfight presence - she will seriously wreck your carries if given a chance.

**Late Game**: You can burst her down if you focus her hard - her shield becomes less effective against big lategame damage.  If she didn't build survivability, make her your #1 focus to get her away from your carries quickly.

**General Playstyle**

Riven is an excellent top lane choice, as she can play hyper-aggressively early and snowball very hard.  Her combo and passive autoattack steroid give her extreme burst, especially in 1v1 scenarios, and her CC can lock a single target down for the entire chain.  In teamfights, her mobility and shield will allow her to march right up to your squishy carries and demolish them before they know what happened.  Her mobility comes from abilities, which makes slows much less effective - but makes silence that much stronger.

* Riven usually wants to win her lane by level 4.  Take away her early-game dominance by playing very safe and not letting her get you in her combo.
* She's pure AD, so starting Cloth Armor + 5 potions is MANDATORY.  Stacking early armor will win you the lane.
* Her combo is very strong, but she is vulnerable after using her abilities.  After a combo, you have approximately 10 seconds to beat the tar out of her without much recourse (her autoattack without passive stacks isn't that scary, and her Q is always a 13-second cooldown)
* Interrupting Riven's combo with hard CC or a silence will drive her crazy and take away a lot of her laning power.  If you can force her to play passively against you, you've won.
* Riven is a beast under tower, either offensively or defensively.  Her CC will make you eat a lot of hits if you dive her, while her shield and mobility will let her dive you with ease.  Be very careful!
* Her ult CD is 75 / 60 / 45 - that's really short for a big steroid.  It's a 20% bonus AD (!) and a range increase on all attacks for 15 seconds. You do NOT want to fight Riven when she has her ult up - just keep your distance and let it burn itself out.
* Riven is a monster in midgame teamfights - she can use her abilities to quickly get to and lock down the squishy of choice, and crush them with her combo and ult finisher.  Do everything you can to peel her away if you're the support or tank, because a missed combo buys you a lot of time.
* Late game, your damage will surpass Riven's natural tankiness from her shield, so you can focus her down hard in teamfights and prevent her from wreaking havoc on your team.
* As a jungler, Riven's clear time isn't great, but her ganks are excellent.  Look to counterjungle her and ward your lane well, and she'll suffer greatly for lack of farm.

In many games, people who are insulted find themselves against snowballing enemies - which means that once they have lost their advantage, the game is usually on a slope.

In my last game, I was playing (again) shyvana as a jungler; I know I'm not a pro, but still I can usually play decently enough. The enemy jungler (Gangplank) came top and killed our solo, then came to mid and killed our Katarina a few seconds later. In the meantime, I was trying to be helpful on the bottom lane, where (at least!) I was able to save my teammates from a doublekill. So, long story short: I then come into GP a few seconds later in the jungle. Bam, I'm dead in a split second. A few minutes later, after killing again our mid, GP finds me in my jungle and more or less one-shots me. The rest of the game was already, more or less, decided: I was 0/2, GP was 4/0. As it often happens, my team started cursing at me (including the wonderful ""/all he's a troll, take a look at his items"": Wriggle's, boots1, giant's belt, 2 wards, 2 pots. I still have to understand why these should be considered trolling items...), saying that if we were losing it was all to blame on me. I completely lost my will to play, and a few minutes later the game ended with a surrender.

In this case I was blamed, and - I know - I also played very bad in the last minutes of the game. But still, I see people cursing their teammates without any apparent reason: junglers, mid and top solos, supports, carries... I think that if we start playing with more ""team spirit"" in our minds, helping those who have fallen behind instead of insulting them, the game might be more satisfying for all of us, and even almost-lost games might turn in a victory.

This week 2 of my mains went free Jayce and Zed, but with the upcoming jayce revamp, everything is going to change so im just gonna write about Zed instead.

Zed is probably the best AD burst assassin in my opinion. His kit allows him to do massive damage if played correctly and he's one of the highest skill cap champs so the possibilities of what you can do is endless.

Laning (Top): at level 1 you can choose Q or E, i usually dont put a point in any skill until i enter lane and see if the other guy harass me a lot when i try to cs or not. If the other guy doesnt harass a lot then put a point into E if he does then get Q and cs from a safe distance. At level 3 you should have a point in every skill and you can try to all in. Zed is actually really strong at level 3 and 4 compared to most top laners. Your Q does a ton of damage if you use it right and your E is good for spamming in long duels. 

Basically what you want to do in lane is farm and watch for when your minions get low. When they try to cs hit them once with one auto and E and back off and maybe throw a Q if you have energy. Don't ever stop harassing keep them chugging pots, make them scared of you. If you're up against a ranged champ use the bushes to cs. Max your Q and bush farm. When a minion gets low step out of the bush and throw a Q and step back inside, this way you dont take free autoattacks when you try to cs. If you throw your Q inside a bush you get revealed and it ruins the whole point of being in the bush so keep that in mind.

Once you hit 6 just all in them, if you kill then great if you dont then at least you know how much damage you do and use this info for future all ins. The basic combo is RQE and continue autoattacking. The reason you Q before E is cause there is a mini delay where you cant attack after you throw your shuriken but if you E you cancel that delay, you can try it ingame and see what i mean. When you ult you get 3 seconds to do as much damage as you can and your ult will deal a % of the damage done. Because of this, Zed's ult can potentially do the most damage out of everyone's lv1 ults.

Teamfights: like all assassin what for everyone to engage and use their skills before you go in. Be patient and look for an opening in the frontlines for you to R in and kill their carry. Always save either a flash or your W to disengage with after you killed their carry.

Tips and Tricks
- use WE to harass safely if you cant aim skillshots for shit like me

- you can shadow E twice if you use E right after you use W

- use flash + W to cover a shit tons of distance, i think its almost the distance between 2 towers

- E interupts your AA so dont E if your about to AA

- a good way to gapclose is WEW, shoot out your shadow and your E will slow them then switch places with your shadow.

- Each shuriken does 50% less dmg to the same target so if you and your shadow's Q hit someone, one of the Q will only do 50% damage. If you hit someone with 3 Qs (you and W's shadow and R's shadow) then 1 Q will do 100% dmg, another will do 50% dmg and the last will do 25% dmg.

- you cant hit someone with 2 E so if you shoot your shadow out and use E, you dont do double damage but you will slow them for twice the amount of both E hits

- your R will shoot a shadow out BEHIND the person when you ult, and you can switch places with that shadow by pressing R again. This is good for when people try to run after you ult them and lets you save your W.",Zed,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,zed,,True,t3_1irmfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1irmfe/oh_its_zed_free_week/,

Honestly, I would rather support than play any other role, merely because of the fact that I feel like supports have one of the biggest roles throughout your game. You keep your carry alive, peel the enemy adc or apc, and people recognize when you do well. I'm currently in Bronze III, and I simply cannot find a reliable team to play with. So, my questions are;

1. How do I make a major impact on my team when I know things are starting to go south? I.E. when top lane loses t1 turret, and our other lanes are being pushed as well.
2. (slightly off-topic, but relevant) What do I do as a support when I have lost my lane? What are some tips or helpful things you great people could tell me to become more effective.

I rode Singed all the way to Gold and was lucky enough to make it through on my first promo series.

My promotion series went like this:

**Game 1** - They picked my Singed so I went Sona.  We dominated our lane, I had the best support game I've ever played.  We won in 25 minutes and I went 1/1/12

**Game 2** - Duo'd with a friend, got Singed top vs. Teemo, our Malz lane swapped with me so I went mid vs. Jarvan and zoned him completely out with double his CS.  We won easily in 30 minutes, I went 7/5/10

**Games 3-4** - I knew it wouldn't be so easy.  We lost the next two games.  I tried my hardest and farmed up well but we couldn't pull it off.

**Game 5** - Singed top vs. Jayce.  After 40 minutes I ended up with almost 300cs.  But he had 250 and was 14/8/8.  He was strong.  Our game went back and forth and I was concerned about possible troll picks with our shaco jungle and jarvan mid.  We had an inhib down, they had an inhib down, it could go either way.  Somehow, someway, a miracle happened and our vayne morphed into doublelift getting a triple kill while he was out on his own and then finished up the last 2 that showed up in lane to try to kill him.  It was like he just got bored of the game and flipped a switch.  I saw a God.  To you good sir - I thank you for my Gold!

I used a lot of information from Summoner School to get here.  I researched, practiced in custom games, did what I could to get better.  It's not as easy for me since I have little time to play.  I'm 35, have a full time job and live in NYC (busy/crazy life ha).  So I'm really excited/proud of this accomplishment.  Of course I'll shoot for the next level, but I reached my goal of Season 3 and feel pretty damn good about it :)

This post was to say thanks to all of the diamond/plat guys answering questions in this sub (your feedback doesnt fall on deaf ears) and to also offer any advice I may have to those trying to get where I am.  Feel free to ask me anything.  Good luck everyone!

I've begun to practice freezing the lane, and learning about common matchups and how my favored picks fare against them. My mechanics, however, are weak.

Are there any mechanical tips an experienced top laner can give me, especially in regards to trading, when to push, and when to freeze the lane?

And as another thought, I've started getting really nervous about solo queuing, even for normal games. The thought of having the pressure of a 1v1 lane that could determine the outcome of the entire game really makes me anxious.

I own a pair of Bronze accounts, one which is Bronze III [a blue eskimo] and one Bronze IV [A Purple Marmot]. My friend, /u/blanketninja and I are going to be playing these two accounts all the way to...somewhere! It might be Gold, it might be Plat, or even Diamond. We're not very good at planning.

Here is some more information about Journey From Bronze:

* You can [follow our progress and find replays through this spreadsheet!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArnAs1sbDO2VdEE3SFAwZk9RU3ZrUVNSNFRWNUhnb1E&amp;usp=sharing)
* We will only be duo-queueing for bot lane to show how a good duo bot can play to win the lane. Otherwise, we will be solo-queueing separately.
* Each game will be recorded and all replays will be uploaded. We'll probably be doing some commentary on Youtube as well.
* My main account, Flaxx, is Gold 3 and I'm bad at video games. His main account, Blanket Ninja, is Diamond 5.
* The purpose of this mini-series is to show how the many tendencies of various Leagues and how to exploit or fix them as a player.

We're not the best players, but we might be able to teach you something :] So without further ado, here are some things about Bronze I have learned!

---------------------

* **Skillshots and poke.** Players at this level generally have lower mechanical skill than at higher levels; they were not as adept at dodging skillshots and respond poorly to aggression. I was able to win lanes just by poking as Nidalee through autos and spears with no retaliation - they would simply back off as I poked them.

* **Junglers and their camps.** I am unsure if this is common throughout Bronze, but the junglers on my team tend to focus more on ganks than their jungle. Some of them succeed and others don't, but by neglecting their jungle they are often a few levels behind the lanes. It wasn't really a matter of leaving a few small camps - often times a jungler would take red/blue and then start ganking, neglecting the other buff for most of the game until I decided to take it for myself. What was also kind of weird to me was that AP mid laners never asked, nor solo'd, the blue buff, so I took it for myself even after pinging it a few times to see if anyone else wanted it. This is a huge amount of experience left untaken by junglers, and I found it really interesting.

* **Wards.** I've been surprised twice from cheesy level one ganks, because these generally don't happen in higher brackets. When my lanemate and I were on blue side, their jungler and bottom lane came in from our tri brush and got an easy kill on us from the surprise factor. Another time when we were on purple side, their bottom lane camped the river brush until we were a little beyond it before coming in behind us.
In general, Bronze players have a grasp of some cheesy ganks like that, but they will usually stick to the obvious gank routes. A few wards to cover general areas will spot most, if not all, incoming junglers.

* **Teamfight focus.** Teamfights were chaotic and wild and everyone chased too far. Despite being a high priority target, I was able to jump in and out of fights because both teams shifted focus from one target to another, leaving everyone with less than 400 or so HP most fights. In addition, high priority targets were often positioned very poorly - if they were focused down, teamfights would be a lot faster and easier.

* **The importance of objectives.** It appeared to me that the most contested objective in Bronze was middle tower; teams rarely grouped elsewhere for dragon or contesting buffs. In addition, once one team gained an advantage, a call for dragon or Baron was rare; instead, both teams would reset and continue the eternal duel in midlane. 

* **Attitudes.** I haven't had any really pleasant encounters from others in Bronze yet. When I did well, they would praise my glory and awesomeness, but otherwise I was just a n00b f33der - there was a LOT of raging. The people we found in Bronze were generally prone to calling mid/top/jungle/ADC almost immediately upon entering the chatroom and would often rage or say really rude things. An example:

Player 1: adc pls

Player 2: mid

Player 3: top

A Purple Marmot: middle or top please

Player 4: adc

Player 1: WTF DUDE

Player 1: SRSLY

Player 1: im picking twitch

Player 1: idc

Player 1: we shoose at the same time [this was untrue, he was a pick after player 4]

Player 1: so you cant say pick order

-------------------

A quick note from /u/blanketninja:

I think there will be a lot of interest in coming out with full game commentaries as I play through these games (especially on support). I'm already in the process of starting to do this; I'm currently uploading a full game commentary on MF and Nidalee support (!). I hope it's something a lot of people are interested in, as I think there is a ton you can learn from watching me play and commentate.
If nothing else, it's just a lot of fun to watch me mess around in lower elo.
We're currently in the opening stages of this project, so any criticism, comments, suggestions, or even fun challenges to do will all be welcome and we're pretty much free to switch up any and everything depending on what garners more interest.

That's about it for part one! If you have any comments/questions/suggestions, please tell us and we'll be happy to listen and respond :]

Cheers and have a lovely day!

Welcome to the 2nd installment of my ""How To Learn..."" series. This time we'll be diving into some of the mechanics of learning itself, so please sit upright, fasten your seatbelt, it's gonna be a bumpy ride!

**Information Overflow** 

At its core, a game of League of Legends is decided by the amount of information available to the players and the decisions they are able to come to and act upon - unless you are a clutz like me, planting a vision ward when I really wanted to pop that health pot, dying afterwards due to an acute lack of health and an oversaturation of bullets and/or arrows, some of them to the knee.

But I'm not talking about the information granted or lost throught the misguided little pink fellow in my example above, at least not exclusively. Apart from ward vision (always buy wards, wards save lives!), the information you need to compute in an average LoL match is mindblowingly huge. From the vantage point of pure information processing, a game of Lol is much like being in ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", except that you're not posed *one* question but *twenty*, you only have 1 second to give all the correct answers, and instead of the friendly host with an enigmatic smile there's a huge, angry crocodile sitting in front of you, ready to bite your face off if even one of your answers was a little bit on the wonky side. And if you're on the EU servers, have in mind the crocodile speaks only portuguese.

Just to chalk up a few of the things you need to know to play somewhat successfully:
what your abilities do, their range, their cooldown, how they interact with your surroundings, with your items, with your opponents, with their items, same for your summoner spells, your champions' passives, and your teammates items and abilities and summoners, your health and mana, their health and mana, what your level means, what the enemies' level means, the gold total acquired through creeps, additional global gold granted through turrets/dragon/baron nashor, the amount of creeps in a lane, the health of your towers, of the enemies' towers, how much damage creeps/towers do in relation to your armor and HP values, in which direction the lanes are pushing, when the creep wave spawns, your general position, the visibility of enemies on the map, your position in relation to other champs and neutral buffs, position of your and your enemies' wards, what buffs do, what buff timers are, on top of all that know what finger presses which button to activate an ability/a consumable/an activated item/that annoying laugh, the position of your mouse &amp; cursor, possibly button combinations with Alt or Shift...

Phew, thats a lot! And its just the tip of the iceberg! Add in your ability to make desicions out of all that and more, and *then* your ability to predict enemy decisions so you are able to hit/evade that Nidalee spear that chunks off a nice 50% of a champions HP, and you can easily equal mind to blown.

So how on earth are you supposed to keep track of all that?

Simply put, you don't.


**Easy Rider** 

The conscious processing capabilities of most humans are somewhat limited. There's only so much you can think about at the same time, and if male gender stereotypes are considered, the average guy has difficulties sticking to *one* thought, especially when household chores are considered. On the other hand, our *sub-conscious* doesnt seem to be that limited. Many of humanity's great ideas gestated while the mind of the owner was somewhere else completely, watching clouds under an apple tree, or playing with the ancient greek equivalent of rubber duckies in a hot tub. In creativity theory this part of the thinking progress is called incubation, because you just sit there and let your head work it out by itself, giving you time to do the dishes after all.

In the learning process there is something similar called internalization. When you first encounter something new, you need to actively *think* about it. Last week's toddler needed to think about walking, most of us do that without effort. When you learn how to read and write it's pretty hard to differentiate a b and a p, and I assume you are managing just fine. The most commonly used example of internalized learning by adults is driving a car - most people get to the point where they can completely remove conscious effort from cruising that chrysler, letting subconscious decisionmaking and muscle memory flow so they have time to check their twitter account, to varying levels of success and health insurance.

What's that got to do with League of Legends? In the essence, you have to learn all of the things from the list above one-by-one, practicing each skill and memorizing each knowledge so often that it gets internalized and you can access it without using your conscious processing capabilities. The less you have to think about managing your champions' abilities the more you can think about positioning, item builds and map awareness. The more you figure out how *that* works, the more you can wrap your head around team compositions, matchups and later on global team-based strategy. It's like a pyramid of skills where you need to complete one tier to be able to think about the next and interalize this one in turn to move on. 

Sure, you *can* think about the countermatchup or the teamfighting phase without having figured out your skillset, but chances are you will stumble in the execution of your plans if you do that. This happens a lot in draft mode, where people are easily baited into playing unfamiliar champions because ""malph OP! U must pick!"" or ""fiddles counters vlad! gogo!"". It is also the reason why so many people suggest mastering one, and only one champion to climb the ranking ladder with, because if you stick to one skillset to internalize through repetition you have an easier time accessing the higher functions of this games' strategic depth. Watching the pro players at the LCS and other tourneys I am regularly struck with awe at the precision, timing and decisionmaking they exhibit, granted by talent, but mostly LOTS and LOTS of practice. Many teamfights there are a firework of abilities, dashes, flashes and ultimates that I have trouble even following as a spectator, but they seem to do just fine. I regularly get lost during teamfights (hint: press SPACE), but then again, they spend their lives driving race cars and I am quite happy with my bicycle, thank you!

Easy, says you. To get really good I only have to practice first one thing then the other, and I'll be on top of Gizeh in no time! Well, in theory, yes, but its not all *that* easy. It would take a very disciplined mind to manage to internalize one thing and only start the next one when its finished, but it really is quite boring to just try to master Veigars Q before even touching his E, and it takes a looooong time if you really have your mind set on doing only that (Youtube proves me wrong on this one :). 

Human learning is also mostly *non-linear*, meaning we encounter A, then move on to B, and later we start figuring out how A *really* works. We also keep forgetting and re-learning stuff all the time. So if you focus on learning one champ, take a break, play another one, you will have to re-learn the first one, at least in part. The bright side is, this gets faster everytime you do it, eventually allowing internalization. And that too might get rusty if it isn't practiced. 
But now: *Onwards to some actual advice!*

* *It really pays to stick to one champion*. Or a few champion of a specific role. Try to find champs you enjoy playing, if you need variation look for similarities in other champions. I, for example, enjoy playing tanky AP's and supports, it suits my mindest. Find your stuff, focus on it as long as your attention span allows and you're having fun doing it, then branch out, come back eventually armed with new knowledge.

* *Set yourself a small learning goal when you play*. Nothing big, just small stuff like ""today I'm gonna focus on hitting my Q better"", or ""I want to figure out where i should stand in a teamfight."" When the game is done look at it again. Chances are, even if you lost the game horribly, you can look back at your criteria and figure out what you did *well*. It really helps your positive outlook. On the other hand, don't get carried away by winning, if you can. Being in a good mood lends itself to looking back at mistakes without feeling bad about your own performance. It might be a good moment to realize that your support really bought *all* the wards that saved your life.

* *Expect to play worse when encountering something new*. Trying out a new champion? Giving the latest item build a whirl? Figuring out the new patch? Faced suddenly with Anit-Bruiser-Bruiser-Lux in top lane? Chances are, you will have your mind on the new thing and miss some vital queues, especially in the unknown matchup-scenario. Thats ok. Dont give yourself a bad time about it, it really is part of the learning progress. As a rule of thumb, when facing the unknown mysteries of the unconventional pick, better play passively on the safe side before you find out that yes, AD Leblanc bot *is* a thing that hurts like a b****.

* *Be patient with yourself*. There is an overabundance of things to learn in LoL. Not only that, but the game is in a constant state of flux with patches, buffs, nerfs, new items, new champions, new metas. This is what makes it the exciting game we love. It also makes it overwhelmingly complicated. Its ok to not remember how Mordekaisers ult interacts with Kog'Maws passive, or what parts of Zyra's kit interact how with Morgana's Black Shield, or wether you take 350 or 349 damage from Leona's Solar Flare due to your cool glasses. Just register the new stuff, store it in a drawer in the back corner of your brain, and maybe it'll pop out like a shac-in-the-box the next time you'll need it.

That's it for now! This really turned out longer than I expected, so I'll spare you the summarization. Hope you enjoyed this little ride around learning mechanics and the League, see you soon for the next installment!

The easiest is buying wards. 

Many bronze-level players seem to think that supports are responsible for all the warding. This leads to a lack of information and giving up map control. 

Supports can not and should not be the sole warders on a team. Junglers traditionally help in this role, but everyone (even the ADC!) should buy a ward occasionally. Wards even fit into the kit of some champions, like Lee Sin.

Secondly, make sure you ward TOGETHER. Your support can not ward a map by himself. He will get caught out, he will die and you'll spend the rest of the game flaming him instead of winning. Instead, move with your support if they need to ward. ",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_199d3c,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/199d3c/warding_in_bronze/,
1355205268.0,35,self.summonerschool,14nheb,AD carry selection ,2marston,44,9,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/14nheb/ad_carry_selection/,"In light of a recent thread where someone was asking which AD carry to pick when, I decided to make this post. The idea is to suggest which AD carries I would pick in which situation. I cannot say this is perfect, correct or even true, but it is what I would do. Here is a short breakdown of the roles of each AD and support:

**AD carries**: 

Bursters: Corki, Graves, Tristana

Traders: Draven, Varus, MF, Vayne, Sivir, Twitch

Pokers: Caitlyn, Kogmaw, Ashe, Ezreal

**Supports**:

Poke: Lulu, Sona, Nunu (hard to place Nunu)

Sustain: Soraka, Janna

Aggressive: Alistar, Leona, Taric, Blitz

Now here are the suggested AD carries vs common lanes:

**Burst AD, aggressive support**:

I suggest picking a strong defensive AD against a lane like this. Either the tanky passive of Graves, or the defensive spell shield of Sivir. You need to reduce the burst of this lane however possible. This opposing lane will often be weakest in lvl 1 and 2 (when they lack offensive abilities) and during this time you can poke and get their health low to reduce the chance they will burst you. This lane is usually strongest at lvl 3 and 6. Be extremely careful at these levels and avoid being cc'd. Fight on your terms not theirs. These lanes usually lack sustain and this can be used to your advantage. 

**Trade AD, poke support**:

These lanes will try to force you into trades which will be detrimental to your laning. I suggest picking a poke AD against this lane. You want to do damage from range with something like Cait auto attack or Ezreal Q but stay out of range of the opposing AD carry. If they manage to get more than 1 auto attack on you, the trade will be lost. Their damage over extended trades is superior. Poke them and poke them hard, they will suffer in terms of sustain and you will eventually force them out of lane. 

**Poke AD, sustain support**:

This is an annoying lane to be against. They will try to force you out of lane by out sustaining you. I personally like to counter these lanes with aggressive tactics. Pick a burst AD such as Graves, Tristana or Corki along with an aggressive support. If you catch either of these 2 off guard, you can burst them instantly for a kill in lane. Do not try to trade in lane as you will come off worse in the long run. Go for kills. Often the support will be as squishy or squishier than the AD so don't be afraid to switch focus to whoever is most likely to be a successful kill. I will often ask my support to pick whoever is out of position and we burst that character. If it doesn't result in a kill, it will often result in forcing the opponent out of lane due to extremely low hp.

**Trade AD, Aggressive support**:

These lanes can be deadly. The support will attempt to cc you to give time for his AD to damage you. It is a strong strategy. I would suggest the strongest counter to be a poke AD. Play a champion such as Cait or Ezreal and poke at the enemy support as they try to get in range to cc you. You can take their health down gradually which means they are too low to engage. If they try to engage on low health they will lose the fight. If you want to use a poke AD like Ashe or Kogmaw, I strongly suggest banning Blitzcrank. You will struggle to avoid his grab all game and a slight mistake will often be fatal. If the enemy has the option of picking Blitz, take Ezreal if possible (his E completely negates grab) or Caitlyn (she has extremely long range and her E can be used to escape).

**Burst AD, Sustain support**:

This lane will usually just push you extremely hard, often to tower, and  hope to achieve greater CS than you. Your best bet is to pick a late-game AD carry, such as Vayne, Ashe or Kogmaw (Yes various categories) and farm what you can. You don't need to out-farm their AD, just stay as close as possible. They have picked a strong early game champion with a support which gives them low kill potential. It allows you the opportunity to take a weak laner and play for late.

1346259456.0,36,self.summonerschool,z10as,Maxing Cooldown reduction gives you 67% more spells.,nutral,41,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/z10as/maxing_cooldown_reduction_gives_you_67_more_spells/,"Something everyone should know, cooldown reduction actually scales better with more you have.

So, to give you a rundown on how that goes:

* 1%  CDR &gt; 1%  more spells
* 10% CDR &gt; 11% more spells
* 20% CDR &gt; 25% more spells
* 30% CDR &gt; 43% more spells
* 40% CDR &gt; 67% more spells

I'll try to explain it better, imagine you have 30 seconds to use spells, the cooldown on your spell is 10 seconds, that means you can fit that spell 3 times in those 30 seconds.

what if you would have 40% cooldown reduction ? that would mean the spell has 6 seconds cooldown, how much times can you fit that into 30 seconds ? 5 times.

so going from 3 to 5 uses of a spell. that is 67% more. If it would be 40% then you would have 4,2 uses of that spell, which is clearly not true.

What does this mean ? Getting that max cooldown helps a lot with spell rotations, if you have 400AP and 30% cooldown, going to 40% and 24% more spells is usually cheaper than getting 24% more damage with AP. This doesn't work great on all the champions, but something to consider when you are deciding what to buy :)

This is also the reason cooldown reduction is capped at 40%, if you look at this graph, going to 75%, any more cooldown reduction than 40% would be very overpowered.

Wrong! To me it's perfectly clear. Let's take a look

Right now the meta revolves around ap mid, bruiser top, ad/support bot, and a jungler.

Let's start with ap mid. This is the best choice in terms of mid-late game. Ap's benefit far more in damage gain per level than ad's, supports, and bruisers. Ap's need farm just like any other champion. In a 1v1 lane many can take the mage creep with 1 spell by level 5. With a couple wards set up you can farm your heart out, harass, and stay relatively safe. A level 10 ranged ad with the same farm as a level 10 mage will get gibbed. This should never be the case because any ranged ad going mid will get harassed to death. There are maybe 2 ad's that can handle the massive harass that Ap's throw out (and that's with heavy zoning)

Bruiser top-Top is probably the lane that's most considerably evolving in the meta. You see new FoTM tops all the time. The main goal for a top is lane stability, and decent damage output. Tops usually don't prosper until late game, and only with heavy farm. There are always counters to this such as teemo for instance. Teemo counters a lot of top laners very well. Anyone without a gapcloser or a ranged move will most likely lose to teemo because they can't catch him.

edit: Bruisers need to have heavy sustain because they are alone in a very big lane. They need to be able to take some damage and stay in lane to farm. They only have themselves to rely on during early-mid game.

Ranged ad/support bot- DRAGON CONTROL. This is why bot is the 2v2 and not the top. Controlling dragon can control the game. You want to be able to have 4 people at dragon in seconds (5 if top takes tp). This needs to be your team gold. Not theirs. The reasoning for a ranged ad with a support is sustain. Most ad's can't survive alone early game, and really all game for that matter. They need protection, and who better than a healer! This provides stability not only for your ad, but for your team. You don't want anyone to get zoned all game, or killed. 

edit:  Ranged Ad's benefit far more from items than from skill levels. While these do help with providing higher damage, the vast majority comes from your auto attack.

Support keep ranged ad's safe. Some of you may say ""well why don't we just not run ranged ad then?"" Ranged ad is extremely viable late game. They throw out massive sustained damage from a distance after they pick up that first BF item

Jungler- This allows you to have 2 solo lanes, control buffs, dragon, and baron. Also provides gank potential to help your lanes prosper. Would you rather be on the team with 4 lvl 10's and a lvl 12, or the team with 3 lvl 10's 2 lvl 12's and all the buffs? Think this is fairly clear.

I think this give a pretty big boost to AD carry damage and might make Taric and Sona more viable since their W's are now the rare armor auras in the game. However looking at the benefits of Aegis vs. Command Banner I realized that no support should bother building Aegis as their first go to item since the individual items only stack some health and magic resistance. Not only does the passive of banner grant the same health regen but gives better stats to the support: +40 ability power and 10% reduction AND +10 more armor there really isn't much a reason to go Aegis or Locket unless the opposing team is AP heavy.

Plus Command is an item that can be a great laning aid if you promote a seige minion thus allowing a support to increase passive push in lane. With Elise being FOTM this item can actually boost spiderling damage and make her even stronger

Edit: read up on the passive giving a boost to minion AD and AP which means passive push gets ramped up much more than I thought, this might be game changing especially if you knock out the enemy's inhibitor.

In this post I hope to clarify what getting caught is, how to avoid it, and what should be the course of action if you or a teammate is caught.



**What does getting caught mean?**



.     For the most part, everyone knows what it means, but however do not identify the root causes of the problem. Getting caught is the act of any over extension resulting in death without any reasonable compensation for the death. On the flip side, if someone snipes a tower, then dies, that's not getting caught, they traded a death for a tower. (I'm not saying that's a good idea all the time however). First I'd like to clarify I'm talking in the general sense after laning phase, dying on gank happens for similar reasons, but should be addressed separately and is not really ""Getting Caught"". Players over extend for 4 main reasons. 
* 1. For CS
* 2. Chasing For Champion Kill
* 3. Warding
* 4. *Attempting* to kill an objective (tower/drag/baron)

.     Now all these things can actually be grouped under one umbrella root cause. Not properly utilizing the mini-map. Which Leads into the next question.



**How do you avoid getting caught?**



.     At ALL times in a game, a player should be generally aware of where their teammates, and the enemy team is located. Now often times members of the enemy team will not be accounted for as they do not appear on the mini map because they are in the fog of war. This is the most important skill to use while viewing the mini-map. You should always consider where the enemy is relative to your position and if you know where they are. 

.     Lets jump into a scenario. Your a top laner. There is a nice new wave of CS just past the dead tower of your enemy. You beat them in lane and are even confident if they return to your lane you can kill them. You have a ward in the river already so your good right? Nothing else you need to worry about. WRONG. You should first and foremost realize that that ward does not cover all possible entrances to kill you, and in the Bronze-Silver level it is VERY common to accidentally miss someone who walks through your ward. 

.     Second, look for any skills (teleports, globals, long initiaters) that could potentially catch you. Third. Think about if you have the ability to A) Easily escape from a gank from the Jungler or B) Kill the Jungler and the laner. Although this is specific to this situation the idea behind it is the same in any situation, identify all possibilities and variables before making an action like pushing, this takes only seconds at most, and can monumentally improve game play. 

.     Another quick example is as an ADC or APC, you almost will always lose 2v1s if you get CC'd as you are very squishy, this isn't your fault, and you'll deal the most damage in team fights, but either you need effective escape, effective mobility to avoid their CC, or most easily, just avoid the 2v1 all together. Simply think about the possibilities, and what they would be thinking. If they see lonely ADC in the bot lane, all they think is KILL KILL KILL. If you have a low health enemy that just got away with low HP run through the same process, first off, do you have sufficient mobility to catch up with them? Do you know where the enemy is? And can you get out after you complete the kill? If you can't avoid death while pursuing for the kill, it is almost always a better choice to just back off, let it go, they got away but so did you. 

.     Getting caught while warding. It is a fine line between getting yelled at for not warding, and getting yelled at for getting caught while warding. It seems quite different then laning, but essentially it uses the same process. Do you know where they are? Do you have a sufficient way to escape? Etc. Just think about how to get the the desired location for your ward in the safest way or maybe ask for help if you think there is a good chance an enemy could be near by your desired ward location.

.     Finally, getting caught going for objectives. This is pretty simple, however people in lower leagues miss judge this ALL THE TIME. For towers, as soon as you get on one of there towers, you have to expect they're sending people for you. Unless they are distracted by another objective, almost never can you get away with sneaking a tower, especially anything past the outer tower. 

.     Often people say they were ""split pushing"", although split pushing is viable, be sure your educated on how to do it correctly, do not assume all you have to do is constantly push a lane, it requires good attention and a similar distraction for the rest of their team. 

.     Now on to dragon and baron. This is also quite simple. If they outnumber you, unless your the jungler, don't go in. If there is a good chance he could steal the jungler is permitted to ""Suicide"" in an attempt to steal baron, suiciding for dragon can be worth early game, but is pretty much never worth it late game.



**Oops! I'm caught. What now?**



.     Getting caught is inevitable and sometimes our reasoning skills and assessing our safety is just not going to work, we'll miss judge our power, their power, forget about TF ulti, etc... It even happens to the pros in tournaments, so although you should attempt to avoid it at all costs, you still need to farm effectively and get kills in order to win the game and sometimes you will be in a sticky situation. 

.     First thing is first. We're going to employ a similar run down of possibilities in order to assess what the best course of actions is. Now getting caught happens fast so this list of things to think about is quite simple in order to be able to make the decision quickly. First off is it even possible to escape? If no teammates are around, your enemies are about to catch up to you, and there is no great path of exit, give up. It sounds bad but saving your summoner spells and ulti for future engagements after you respawn can be very helpful. 

.     On the other side. Look for those same things. Is there a good wall you can flash over to create distance? Go for that. Is there a teammate close enough? Go for them. Now this implies they are coming toward you to help, dont bring them into a bush of your low hp recalling teammate, seriously, I've seen it before and its just mean. Lol.

**GAH! NOT AGAIN! My teammate is caught! What do I do?**

.     Obviously spam chat with hate messages yelling at the victim for getting caught. It happens in every game soit must be an effective method to win! NO! NO! NO! I am obviously being sarcastic. There is proper courses of action to take in this situation. Can you save them? If you turn a 2v1 into a 2v2 or your buddy comes to make it a 2v3 you may want to turn and turn their gank on their head. 

.     However, this is rare. Often times the person is low, or is out numbered 3, 4, or 5 to one. Don't be a hero. Let leave that soldier behind. Its so sad. But almost always going in to help a caught teammate is basically just putting whipped cream and a cherry on top for the other team, they get an extra free kill from nowhere. Again, don't just react, try to think if you have any spells that could get the poor guy out, and if not, don't risk your own life. Also, avoid initiating a team fight when someone is caught, most likely they will get blown up immediately and then the team fight you just started is 4v5 right of the bat. Bad idea. A better idea is to let them die, and go on defense. It is still very hard to push down towers 5v4 and you just need to wait till the 5th player is back up, much better then trying to save them and giving them not only more kills, but an opportunity to take an objective.

.     And to the point I poked fun at in the beginning of this paragraph. Obviously its never a good idea to yell at your teammates. But even saying ""Don't get caught please"" probably won't help much. Try to guide your teammates where to go by calling out objectives to go for or defend, and saying names spefically ASKING not TELLING them to go somewhere. People hate to be TOLD what to do by-In their mind- some idiot in solo queue, if you ask them, they get the satifaction of complying and making it feel like their own decision.


**TL;DR** Im so sorry for the length, but whip out some spectacles, I think you'll get a lot out of reading the whole thing! If you REEEALY don't want to read it, just keep in mind the variables going into your positioning at all times to avoid getting caught!

1369860032.0,32,self.summonerschool,1faief,Smiting Tips for New Junglers,TheKingfisherNA,37,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1faief/smiting_tips_for_new_junglers/,"(This is already posted on /r/leagueoflegends, but I thought it would be nice to put it here too for those who might not know about this trick to smiting)

It's the bane of all junglers when the smite is missed and a key objective is gone to the other team...

So to help avoid that, I found a really nice and easy way to help time smites so when it comes down to who smites baron or dragon first, you (as the jungler) will be the one to win the objective for your team:

* Check how much true damage your smite will do while your team (or the enemy team) is attempting baron or dragon. Do this by moving your cursor over the smite icon and read the info box.

* Then click on dragon/baron and look to the top-left corner of your screen to see how much health it has while your team or the enemy team is securing it. This also allows you to see the rate the dragon/baron's health is going down.

* SMITE IT when you see the health is close to how much damage your smite will do to it.

*** Remember to time your smite with another damage skill (if in good position to do so) - as Cho, use Feast + Smite; as Nunu, use Consume. Always Smite + another ability, even if it's just Eve's Hate Spikes - this makes it easier to outsmite an opponent who isn't considering the extra damage the ability gives you, especially if he was depending on outsmiting you with higher smite damage due to a level advantage. 

***  Check the enemy team, if they have some long range CC. For example, the enemy jungler is Jarvan IV: Baron has 1.5k HP left, he jumps in 1 sec later, makes you airborne and smitesteals, flashes out before too big damage is applied to him. Long range CC will stop you from smiting.


*** Depending on the damage output that the dragon or baron is taking, you can time the smite to happen a little before it hits that threshold of where your smite can kill it in one shot based on the rate the health is falling.

*** This helps when securing or stealing red/blue buffs too.

Credit: TheOddOne. I learned how to jungle watching him and I noticed he would do this when it comes to securing big objectives.

Finally:

I feel that if more junglers would do this, the chances of missing the smite is much less than if the jungler were to just eyeball the health bar and base it off of that. Keeps you (the jungler) and your team happy :)

With 2 people top if bot pushes up just a little the jungler and bot lane can take dragon exremely safely, mid can even come down to help out but isn't necessary unless their mid comes down. Most junglers in my bracket do not understand that controlling the dragon is very beneficial to your team and they won't even ward it or be in a position to contest dragons.

If you are placed onto a team, you will receive no direct notification except by email; however there will be a post on this subreddit on Friday or Saturday with a list of all the teams and subs so pay attention for that.

Schedule for this week is the same as last week:

1pm PST/4pm EST: ARAMs  
3pm PST/6pm EST: Novice Match  
4pm PST/7pm EST: Intermediate Match  
5pm PST/8pm EST: Advanced Match  
Potentially more ARAMs/ABAMs if people want to stick around, no sign-ups required

Reply to this thread and include your summoner name and add me (RheingoldRiver) ingame if you haven't already if you want to volunteer.

And please help this post get visibility, thanks!!

**Long:**  SNSS is a series of scrims played Sundays starting in the afternoon through the evening.  There are several games played each week.  The first two are ARAMs, which are open to ANYONE---you can be level 1 and it can be your first game of League of Legends ever, or you can be Challenger tier.  We'll try to balance the teams, but anyone is welcome to play.

After the ARAMs, we have a novice match for unranked players with a small  number of normals wins and bronze league players.  Each team will also have one plat+ player who will play a support (no Blitzcrank anymore!) and try to carry their team through playcalls and general advice as opposed to direct play.  After the novice match, the teachers will talk onstream about the games and answer questions.

Next is the intermediate match, which is for silver players and players with 400+ normals wins who haven't played ranked.  If you're borderline between novice/intermediate you can sign up for both and we'll decide where to place you.

Finally there's the advanced match, which is for gold+ players.  After the game, everyone who played in it will talk onstream about how it went and try to explain why the teams made various decisions.

If you are interested in SHOUTCASTING, you can use the same sign-up form as the one for playing.  No casting experience is required to cast the ARAM games, but we ask that you have a decent amount of experience prior to casting the SR games.

If you're interested in VOLUNTEERING, there are several things that you could do to help.  Reply to this thread and add me (RheingoldRiver) ingame and I'll let you know what needs to be done.  Basically, it's possible for me to run this event by myself, but the more help I get, the more things we can do in the future, like including more games, trying out different types of games, basically anything that the community is interested in.

Even if you spoke with me about volunteering in the past, if I haven't specifically given you something to do, please message me!  I wasn't able to keep track of everyone who said they were interested in helping out.  (As of my posting this thread, I haven't specifically talked to anyone about what they're doing.)

**ITEM BUILD**

Don't forget ! As a jungler, your build will never EVER be the same everygame. You will have a base build, but you have to consider the state of your game to build your next item. Do they have a double AP ? =&gt; Bulwark/Iron Solari. Do they have a full AD compo ? =&gt; Rush mass armor before damage (Omen,..). Who is fed, who does massive damage, do YOU need damage, for the TEAM, and not for you etc etc. You have to consider so many factors while buying.

Some item path :

**1st Build : Normal Build /**

[Hunter's Machete] &gt;
 
[Boots of Speed] + [Madred's Razors] &gt; (Try to back with 825g to get one ward)

[Locket of the Iron Solari] + [Mercury's Treads] &gt; (Build the KindleGem 1st, then choose between armor or MR)

[Warmog's Armor] OR [Sunfire Cape] &gt; (Warmog for tanking, Sunfire for damage and armor)

[Randuin's Omen] &gt; (Huge item against ad, don't forget the active)

[The Black Cleaver]. (If you want some damage in late, that could be good)

**2nd Build : Against Double AP /**

[Hunter's Machete] &gt; 

[Boots of Speed] + [Madred's Razors] &gt; (Try to back with 825g to get one ward)

[Aegis of the Legion] + [Mercury's Treads] &gt; (Get MR and life fast, then finish the Aegis and the boots)

[Runic Bulwark] &gt; (When you got it, teamfight will be really easier)

[Locket of the Iron Solari] &gt; (Really good against AoE damage, and you gains armor for the adcarry ennemy)

[Warmog's Armor] &gt; (Really good against AP, since they don't have constant damage (except : Cassio etc))

[Randuin's Omen]. &gt; (Huge item against AD, don't forget the active)

**3rd Build : Good early start (3 kills in 7-8mins, good farm) /**

[Hunter's Machete] &gt; 

[Boots of Speed] + [Wriggle's Lantern] &gt; (With 3 kills, you should be able to 1 shot the lantern + boots)

[Giant's Belt] + [The Brutalizer] &gt; (If you are really ahead, you can buy a Brutalizer)

[Sunfire Cape] &gt; (Armor for dives, and more damage)

[The Black Cleaver] &gt; (You should be snowballing, so you should gain tons of golds (Drake, etc)

[Randuin's Omen] &gt; (DIS ITEM IS JUST TOO STRONG)

These build are some example and SHOULD NOT BE YOUR CORE BUILD. You can be disagree with this. Try to 
think by yourself EVERY GAME, about your build.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
**ANALYSIS OF MY BUILDS**

**1st Build : The ""Normal Build**

So in this 1st build I recomend to don't finish the lantern firstly. Xin doesn't need sustain in the jungle when his W heals him enough. His base damage are really good, so he doesn't need the bonus AD too. You win already 900g to build something else.
I recommend after the Locket of the Iron Solari. Xin scales very well with CDR (cooldown reduction). With that, he'll be able to dash every 5sec if he hits 3 times with his Q up. Which is huge. The slow lasts 2 seconds, and 3 sec later, an other dash coming up. And for only 2200 gold, he'll win 30 Armor, 400HP + a shield which is very good for this price.
Warmog or Sunfire Cape ? It's up to you. I like the Warmog to tank the AP caster with burst, but the Sunfire Cape is really good against bruisers top/jungle too.
The Randuin's Omen is, in my opinion, a must-have in late game. The AS slow is really good, you gains massive armor and health. Against a 4 item AD carry, you'll be able to tank him really nicely (until he gets Infinity Edge).
The Black Cleaver, if I wants some damamage, this item is really nice.

**2nd Build : ""Against Double AP""**

As a jungler, it's really hard to tank a double AP composition in mid game. They got a high burst who can instakill you, if you are out of position.
So I wants to rush LIFE and MAGIC RESIST as fast as possible. If forget the lantern : 900g won already.
I'll rush the aegis who provides LIFE and MAGIC RESIST. After I'll get the Mercury's Treads.
Aegis is REALLY important against this composition, for you and your team.
After i'll get the Bulwark, which is a huge boost for you (+400HP, +60RM(you) +30RM(team), and for your team.
And finally, i'll get the Locket of the Iron Solari, who gives a great shield against AoE damage.
This is you core build against that composition. If you are behind, then you have to get a giant belt fast. Life helps a lot against AP.
If you are ahead, or you want more MR, you can go for an Hexdrinker who provide damage also.

**3rd Build : ""Good Early Start""**

I said you can save 900g if you don't build the Lantern. Build when you are really ahead, the Lantern will provides you a decent amount of damage, and you can force early drake with his passive who deals so much damage to the objectives. You got some early kills. So you objective will be to make the game snowball : try to gank bot with pink wards to kills them or to make them low and go for a drake. Then keep ganking/farming and get the turret. Get as much objectives as you can. I know it's hard sometimes when your laner is saying ""Don't take the turret yet blablabla"". Take the turret at 15-16min and it should be fine, earlier if your laner is already fed.
Don't go full AD build, try to mix between damage and tanking. A tanky bruiser is more bothering than a full DPS bruiser. Focus the carries, if you can OS them with your team, or protect yours from the ennemy's bruiser and let them end the fight.


This is an analysis of the these three builds. I've explained you why am I building this or this on which circumstances as much as I can. Sure it won't cover all the situations but I hope this will help.
Don't forget : It's MINE point of view, i'm not the God of the Jungle, you can be disagree.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
**AS A JUNGLER**

Xin is a really good jungler actually due to his huge steroids.
His ult can gives him 100 Armor and MR, at level 16. Usually you'll gain 40/60 Armor and MR. It's a heavy steroid to tank in teamfight.
His base damage are awesome especially on the Q and the R, who can does 50% of the carry's life without any damage item.
His passive, who can helps your ADC to kill a bruiser.
And his low-CD AoE slow dash (every 5-6sec). He can almost spam it on teamfight, to protect your carry, or to engage in the melee with your bruiser.

He doesn't really needs the blue, since his mana cost are really low.
His clean time is correct, not excellent, but no too bad.
As a counterganker he is really awesome. At lvl 3, his damage and his knock-up are scary. When you are ganking against a Xin Zhao, be really carefull especially if you got a tank-jungler (Maokai,...). He'll totally crush you.

My name is Dkas.Before I start to ask Questions I would like to give some insight about me.
In Season three I managed to reach Gold tier division 2.
http://i.imgur.com/ndxenPs.jpg

I reached gold tier division two from division 4 by solely playing Jungle.
I was in EU-NE and decided to transfer back to EU-W because of my friends there.
While my stats ( Games I played ) transferred with me I got placed into the Silver tier division 3.Most likely because I was Silver Tier division 3 when **I LEFT** for EU-NE. 

http://i.imgur.com/V9lFE54.jpg
I contacted  Riot-Support about this particular problem.I was left without any help.I duo-Q with my friend
and tried to get back to gold tier 2 (my friend was Silver 1 but a Gold player like me ).
The real problem now was something that sadly riot should be blamed for and something that I didn't realize myself until it was too late.**I WAS STILL BEING MATCHED UP** with Gold Tier 2 +  people (Due to my hidden elo from east ? )Combined with my friend who was Silver 1 our duo-Q backfired and turned into an insane mix of silver,gold AND Platinum players(I'm not talking about badges but about Tiers here)

After a good amount of games I finished up in Silver Division 1.From there I got 6 times into my
promotion games for Gold.I lost All those opportunities  though.Gradually my Hidden elo was sinking 
to the point where I actually got demoted to a ""true"" Silver player.I never understood how things
could go so wrong.So I started to question myself.There are two things I always struggled with while jungling

1) Ganking: As a lot of people know laners tend to exaggerate against Junglers.You didn't gank,you lost my lane etc etc.I usually Ignore those people and keep on going,BUT after a while i realized how 
necessary it is to gang in this elo range.People think that jungler are ganging  machines and I disagree
with this.Whatsoever,since I had no results and kept on dropping I started to strive for more ganks.
I hit my major problem there,Wards.Always the same,when I tried to gank the enemy had his lane warded.I tried to lane gang.The Laners mostly didn't co-operate and I lost time and effectiveness since I lost farm.I never knew what to do at times like this.I was helpless.While I couldn't gang a lane the enemy jungler was harvesting it.Asking for some help resulted into a lot of arguing and no results.

2)Farming/Objectives: As a Jungler I thought I should always strive for jungle control instead of gangs.I know that there are specific Junglers that are supposed to gang or farm.

 
Every single advice and help is welcome.Feel free to add me aswell in game.DKAS.
I'm online most of the time and I play quite often.So i accept every sort of advice
even if it is harsh.

 
Thanks a lot


**TL;DR : I want to be a Jungler that can influence the game and win.**

100 wins and 100 losses!  


I jumped into ranked before I was ready and it took a long time to break even. Recently I went on a rampage with Hecarim (74% win rate now) and I slowly climbed back up.  

 

I have improved a lot as a player but I owe my recent success to learning how to exploit 1100 elo junglers. My lanes help me get a smiteless blue and I immediately counter the enemy's first red buff. I make sure I ward their blue around 7 minutes and since they want to donate it to their mid laner, it's simple to smite-steal that too. Most people don't know how to deal with losing 2/3 of their first buffs and most laners don't know how to respond correctly when they catch me in their jungle. Because of this, there is practically no jungle presence from their side and I can spend a lot of my time ganking. I know this won't work when my opponents learn to counter my aggressive counter jungling, but for now it's been netting me some easy wins. :)  


Another thing I like to do is take exhaust as my second summoner spell. I camp two lanes (either mid+top or mid+bot), snowballing those two at the cost of neglecting the other lane. When teamfights start I will exhaust the lane that I didn't apply pressure on.  


Anyways, as I am at 1142 elo now, my next win will get me silver. Wish me luck!

You actually play worse after losing a few games, or 99% of us do. You know the frustration from that last game where you did great and still lost? It's passed on to the next game subconciously, and will make you preform worse than you would had you not had that loss from before. I usually take a break after 1, max 2 losses for this sole reason. Go watch some tv series, go running, gymming w/e. Just take your mind off the game for a while, and return refreshed.


Sometimes you have lucky streaks or unlucky streaks of +-200 elo, but after about 400 games, you should be at the elo you CURRENTLY belong.


It's hard for me to judge if you became better or worse since i've never seen you play.


If you won your lane, you did all that should be required to win the game (providing you didn't derp out at some point in the game.). I don't think anyone has ever had a game where they made ALL the correct plays in EVERY occasion, so just do your best and see where it leaves you.


My last point brings me to how to improve, once again. Always reflect upon yourself. You won your lane, but could you have done anything better? Did you lose your lane due to you getting outplayed, or getting ganked? If you got ganked, should you have played more defensive, should you have seen it coming? There is alot of questions you need to ask yourself after every defeat AND victory. Doing this will let you improve on your faults actively. You can't really fix the problem, if you're not sure what it is.


At this point, some of you are prolly thinking ""but muffit, my bot lane fed 0/20 and my mid afked wtf am i supposed to do?!"". Well lads, as long as you played your game and didn't give up, you did all you could. If you win your lane EVERY SINGLE GAME (nobody does) you will ALWAYS rise in elo.
Think of it this way, you have 4 (5/5-you) possible ""bad players"" on your team. The enemy team has 5. (5/5) (sick maths by muffit(tm))


Eventually the percentage will even itself out and you will be at the elo you belong. Just let that sink in for a while.


I didn't intend for this to become this long, but i got a bit carried away. These are my personal thoughts on the elo system and how to improve individually, since that's why it's called --------&gt; SOLO &lt;-------- queue.
But first and foremost, have fun! Never flame your teammates, try to keep a positive mindset and keep pwning! If you have to yell, yell to your friend on skype or at your screen.


TL;DR: My longest post ever, just read it.


edit: yes i know i prolly have like 10k spelling and grammatical errors in my text, i did not double check it. I hope it's readable enough.

At my elo the opponents suck (and so do I), and they are ever so likely to throw the game. LOL is not a game of ""First blood gg"". Why? Because a single mistake at certain parts of the game can cause a team that has the 100% advantage to lose.

2. ~~You lose three additional elo simply for surrendering. If you just played the game out, even if you lost, you would not hurt yourself as badly as surrendering.~~ (I'm not sure this is true, thanks to a comment on this post by redditor angel14995 .)

3. By surrendering, you are asserting that your knowledge of the game is complete enough to judge the entire outcome of the game and that simply isn't reasonable. I'm not able to predict the future.

4. You are tilting yourself potentially, over the long term. If I always maintain some optimism about a game, even if the game is really really behind, I'm much less likely to become mad and rage at people. However, if I never finish games unless its 100% in my favor at the 20 minute mark, I am not only going to tank my elo, I'm going to tilt myself hard, because I'm going to feel pretty hopeless about most games.

1375851197.0,34,self.summonerschool,1jv4dv,Safe go-to champs for each role?,minimalistical,43,9,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jv4dv/safe_goto_champs_for_each_role/,"I'm very wordy when typing, so skip to the end for a TL;DR if you wish.  

I main support, love playing mid (although I've given up on ever getting to play it), and can take top if need be relatively safely. I know how to ADC, though I'm not very good at it, but the thought of jungling stresses me out. I was thinking today about my ""safe"" champs - champions that are either forgiving to play or ones I'm comfortable enough with to safely be able to play even in unfavorable matchups, against unfamiliar opponents, or in unfamiliar roles. The champs I consider safe picks due to familiarity I know no one can suggest, but I was wondering what relatively safe picks for each role are. Before I ask that, though, I'll explain a bit about who I play in each role.  

Like I said, I main support. Although I'd say support is the one role I don't really have a safe pick I default to in - each support excels in different matchups - I suppose my safest pick here is Lulu. There are matchups she's better with than others, of course, but she can work in just about any game, and I'm very familiar with her. After Lulu, I'd say Thresh and Sona would be the safest picks; Thresh for tankiness and shielding, and Sona for healing and stunning. My other supports (Alistar, Blitzcrank, Fiddle, Janna, Morgana, Soraka, and Zilean) I consider situational and each one has certain matchups they would be very bad picks against.  

My go-to safe mid pick is Brand, mostly for familiarity. I know many people will disagree with me about this and consider him an unsafe and unfavorable pick, but he's a mid champ that I know I can, if not win lane, then avoid losing lane with. My main problem, in any role, is being outranged - I have a hard time dealing with that - but with Brand I can hold my own even if outranged. After Brand, Lux and Morgana would be my next safest picks. Cassiopeia, LeBlanc, Nidalee, Ori, Syndra, Teemo, and TF all either have weaknesses that can easily be exploited or are less familiar to me.  

For top lane, I've found that Kennen is my safe pick. I haven't played him much, so my reason isn't familiarity here, but his kit is forgiving enough that I've started picking him almost every time I have to play top, since it's a lane I'm not as experienced at. Before Kennen, Teemo was my safe pick for top, mainly because I could be annoying without necessarily winning my lane. Yi, Nidalee, Riven, Rumble, Shen, and Singed I'm not as confident with. Especially with Singed - I can manage to be a bad Singed in any and all ways Singed can fail.  

I rarely play ADC, and so far I only have three champs for the role - MF, Ashe, and Corki. However, my favorite ADCs to play are Cait and Varus, so I'm not quite sure why I don't have them yet. Of the ADCs I currently own, though, I suppose MF would be my safest pick.  

As for jungling... I'll be honest and say I'm a really bad jungler. I can never manage to show up at the right lanes at the right time, so I have serious respect for all of you good junglers out there. However, if I do have to jungle, I have Nautilus, Nocturne, Nunu, and Udyr to choose from. Of those, Naut is my safest pick, simply because Thresh and Blitz have made the hook second-nature to me.  

As you can probably see from my champion list, I love CC. If I'm not playing a champ with CC I feel naked. In fact, of all the champions I own, only four lack CC of some sort - Soraka, Yi, Corki, and Nidalee. I never play Soraka unless requested to do so, Yi feels awkward to me, Corki has an escape instead, and Nid's spears make up for the lack of CC in my opinion. Strangely, the one champion I own that I failed to mention so far is Ryze, who has an incredibly easy form of CC. I refuse to play Ryze, though, simply because I don't have fun with him at all.  

**TL:DR**  

All of this brings me to my question: who do you consider safe picks in each role? I know it will vary greatly depending on the person, but I think tops like Kennen are safe due to their kit more than the skill of the person playing. Do the other lanes have a champ you would consider the safest pick?

Hello everyone it's me Carlboison, during the week I have seen a number of posts saying something along the lines with ""how do I jungle"". On one of those posts I make a quick guide on how to which received posetive feedback. What I have decided to do is to expand on that and go more into detail on things. Please do keep in mind that I am not the *best* jungler in the world all I want is to share what I know with others, hope you enjoy it :)

###What is my loadout? (Masteries, Runes)

Each champion will require a different type of rune/mastery combo to be efficent to the max, but here below are some good *starter* loadouts examples that will make your **First** Jungle experience much more pleasant!


* [Beginner **AD** Masteries](http://imgur.com/kperZm3,4Rq0ped) - This will let you deal with the jungle fairly quick while getting safeguard incase you get adventures and want to dive towers, Example champ: Tryndamere [](/tryndamere)


* [Beginner **AP** Masteries](http://imgur.com/CQd1FRv) - This have about the same focus as the AD one, get damage clear jungle with extra tower dive protection, Example champ: Diana [](/diana)

* [Beginner **AD** tank Masteries](http://imgur.com/FTvfcvH) - This you would want to use on the tankier guys which utelize AD DMG, Example champ: Udyr [](/udyr)


* [Beginner **AP** tank Masteries](http://imgur.com/2NrNCto) - This is something you can use on tankier AP champions, Example Champ: Nautilus [](/nautilus)

---

Runes is a important part in the jungle, while not everyone can affort them right off the bat I will still push up a **few** *usefull* setups one could use.

[Runes for Attack Speed junglers](http://imgur.com/6niSCL9) - You would want to use this on junglers that get something from attack speed Example Champ: Nocurne [](/nocturne)

[Runes for AD junglers](http://imgur.com/E9m94Up) - This would allow you to clear the jungle fast while still haveing the ArP to help you do more DMG in ganks, Example champ: Fiora [](/fiora)

[Runes for AP junglers](http://imgur.com/b9YQoKe) - This gives you the armor you need to survive with the dmg you need for clear speed/ganks, Example champ: Evelynn [](/evelynn)

[Runes for AD Tanks](http://imgur.com/I5qpIsU) - This are the runes you would want to use on the AD tanks which gives them a decent clear speed and gives them some ArP for the ganks, Example champ: Jarvan IV [](/jarvaniv)

[Runes for AP Tanks](http://imgur.com/ejzaE39) - Many AP tanks scale off health of some spell they have, Nautilus have his sheild Zac[](/zac) have his passive and so does Shen [](/shen). Useing hybrid pen you get the best of both worlds, you get fast jungle clear time and stronger ganks!!



*---Please remember that these things are not set in stone, just a few starter setups---*
---








---
###What items do I start with?

On *Most* Champs you would want to start with the items:

* [](/huntersmachete) - Laters upgrades to [](/madredsrazors)(If you Auto Attack a lot)  OR [](/spiritstone)(On tanky/AP champions)

* [](/healthpotion)x5

Exeptions could be:

* [](/clotharmor) - On Rammus [](/rammus)


* [](/amplifyingtome) - On Fiddlesticks [](/fiddlesticks) 

But always take item+pot.
And don't forget the spell [](/smite)

---
###Where do I start?
If you decided to use a champion with mana it is very standard to start killing the ancient golem which is the monster located: 

* [Here for blue team](http://imgur.com/vPcfmUq).

* [Here for purple/red team](http://imgur.com/kpL4rqb).

Killing the Ancient golem[](/golem) will grant you a **BLUE** buff (See below)

&gt;This unit regens 25 flat mana regeneration per 5 seconds and 0.5% of their maximum mana (or energy) per second and has 20% cooldown reduction on their abilities. If slain, this buff transfers to the killer.

As long as you hold the buff you will *never* run out of mana(Still possible but very difficult) and all your spells will have shorter cooldowns meaning that you will be able to use them more often to help you kill the jungle monsters.

---

Hoever if the champion you are useing does **NOT** use mana, few examples would be:

*  [](/leesin) Leesin - Uses Energy
* [](/rengar) Rengar - Uses Ferocity
* [](/mundo)  Dr.Mundo- Uses Health
* [](/shyvana) Shyvana - Only restricted by Cooldowns

Then you would start at the red lizzard buff which is located 

* [Here for blue team](http://imgur.com/Z7nObFK)

* [Here for purple/red team](http://imgur.com/Ht6z7Uw)


 Killing the Lizard Elder [](/lizard) will grant you a **RED**
 buff (See below)

&gt;This unit's physical attacks apply a debuff that slows the target's movement speed by 8 / 16 / 24% (5 / 10 / 15% for ranged attacks) for 3 seconds and a DoT that deals 8 + (2 × level) bonus true damage twice. If the buff holder is slain, this buff is transferred to the killer.


In other words this buff will make your Auto Attacks and spells that apply ""On-hit-effects"" Slow the target and burn them for Ture DMG. With this your ganks will be **VERY** dangerous

---
###Ganking

After you have required the desired buffs and gained the xp you wanted it is now time to gank!

But what is a gank?...

A gank is when a person goes to another lane outmanning/overpowering the enemy this person is most common the jungler. The point of the gank is to put the enemy at a disadvantage in one way or another, it could be:

* Get a kill on them
* Forceing them to flash
* Make them use importent spells/items

You want to make sure that the target in question have not warded the entrence you have decided to come from as then they are ready for you and won't play agressive makeing it almost imposseble for you to gank. If you are not aware of that you are just standing in a bush wasting gold/xp as you are not doing anything. Worst case scenario would be that they kill you when you try to gank or call in thier jungler to come in from behind you.

Always remember to ping when you are about to gank so your lanes knows what you are doing so they can be ready for you
---


---
###Types of junglers

There are different types of junglers but they all have the same goal, to help other lanes/ counter jungle.
There are:

* Ganking Jungles like [](/sejuani) , have strong ganks but dosen't clear the jungle as fast as others.
* Farming jungles like [](/masteryi), have a realy fast jungle clear time but dosen't gank as effective as others.
* Counter jungles like [](/nunu) who can quite easy steel enemy jungle monsters to deny the enemy jungler xp/gold.
* Support jungles like [](/maokai) dosen't farm jungle that great, have good gankes but dosen't need to amass the same amount of gold as the ganking jungler and rather just snowball his lanes instead.

Even though you are a farming jungler you must still gank to help your lanes.

You can also help our lanes by counter jungling as it forces the enemy team to start warding thier own jungle and puts thier jungler focus on you.

**NEVER** Counterjungle with less then 50% health!!

###The Dragon
Being a jungler it's also most of the time your job to secure and kill the monster dragon[](/dragon)  which gives 190gold **PER** player on your team which could realy put you ahead in terms of gold/xp.

You can find the dragon [here](http://imgur.com/o9FeQqy)

The Dragon is a realy powerfull monster so many times you would need atleast one or two other pepole 
to help you kill it somewhere in the early-mid game

You should not atempt to kill the dragon unless you have the following:

* Jungle item [](/madredsrazors)/[](/spiritstone) 

* [](/smite) - Let you secure the kill incase the enemy tries to steel it

* [](/sightward) - Protection so you can see if anyone is on thier way to try to steel the dragon/kill you

* [](/visionward) - Clear enemy wards so they don't know that you are doing it/can't see you do it

---
###Don't give up

If you are new to the jungle one is proned to get talking down  to from the team but *Don't let them discourage you* from doing it as we all got to start from somewhere and when you feel like you can't sink any deeper in the sickhole just remember that from the point you are there is only one way to go!

I've had several people ask me when the next lecture is coming out. I recorded the mid lane lecture, but then LoLReplay came out with a new update, which allows me to use old replays. 


Hence, since Pempti gave me quite a few replays to use, I will be re-recording and reuploading this lecture after my assessments are over. 


The next lectures are: 


Lecture 9 - Mid Lane


Lecture 10 - Ranked 5's Organised Play + The Mid Game + The End Game


After this I'm not so sure what topics I can cover. 


I would appreciate any suggestions for what you guys want for further lectures. 


I will definitely be re-recording lecture 1 once my exams are over (June some time)

I'll play a game against a team with no ADC. with bruisers instead
we will have a good mid game (strong dragon control and more kills) , but when late game comes around the whole enemy team has warmogs(plus sunfire or randuins). Even with a cleaver and LW it is still hard to burst even one of them down let alone 4-5... just because of sheer hp with moderate resistances. 

now my team has 1-2 tanky bruisers (top and jungle)

they soak some damage but they cant survive all 5 and end up falling before a fully built ADC cant damage even one of them past 60/70% hp. 

The end result is a team of fully built tanks overwhelming a team with fully built ADC and APC just by sheer tankiness with minimal damage items.

I thought ADC's were supposed to be the late game carries!

SO that comes to my question... Is this un-balanced and if not how does a normal meta team deal with it?

I figured I would post this up to give everyone a bit of encouragement. Im not a great LOL player by any means. My mechanics are iffy, my positioning isnt always great, and most frustratingly my understanding of how to play the game greatly dwarfs my skill at playing it. I guess that’s because I watch too many games and play too few.

I started playing LOL again after what I call a 'ragebreak' of about 6 months. I hit a point where I was angry after playing a game and decided that if it makes me angry, I am not having fun, and probably shouldn't be doing it. I have a friend who got me playing again simply by watching him and remembering how fun it could be. So, without much practice I started into ranked.

I did pretty well to start with and got carried a bit. I found my share of trolls and bounced around and when the dust settled on my starting games I was at a reasonable, but low ELO of 1080. I had a few wins, then disaster struck. I had a trainwreck of games. Some were me, some leavers, some trolls and I started getting mad. Then, like most people, I played worse. Then I started raging.

Then I played even worse.

Then I stopped playing for a weekend and had a think about it. One that would not have happened if I had not have dropped around 400 ELO in 2 weeks. I realised that this was the best thing that could have happened. I didn’t care about winning enough that it would make me mad any more. I still get frustrated, but my ELO is low enough that I dont really care about ELO. I care about having fun and playing games.

So now I dont mind if I lose every game, long as I can review my games, note what I did wrong and improve. If I learn, if I take the opportunity to create a 'teachable moment' then the game is not a loss, its a lesson, and I have improved. The only time you can really lose in LOL is if you don’t stop and review, learn what YOU did wrong, and correct your behaviour.

If your rage and blame your team, your missing the point. You didn’t carry your team, you didn’t win the game, you died, you failed to step in when you should have, you were out of position, you stepped in when you should have pulled back... there is always a reason, and barring someone chain suiciding on a tower... its not them. If you died, you made a mistake.

You are the reason you lose.  

For me, I know ill improve, and ill work my way up. Sure at a lower ELO I get frustrated at a support that doesn’t ward, but if I'm positive and try to help I find that by the end of the game they ward better. Even if that means I start placing the wards till they get it right. Ill get frustrated when a Jungle doesn’t gank, or goes for the easy kill at a lane that is winning instead of one that is in trouble, but that is OK. Its another 'teachable moment' that I can take away and make sure I don’t do when I'm in that position.

So at the end of the day it will take a lot of games to climb back up. That is fine, its playing the game, its the adventure, and the experience that is the reason you play, not your ELO. So instead of ELO I review my games count how many mistakes I make because I know if that ever get close to 0 my ELO still wont matter, it just means I need to find new ones.

Thanks for reading. If your stuck somewhere and feel like its hell, I hope this will help you enjoy the game and stop worrying about ELO so much.

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/leesin ""Lee Sin"") **Lee Sin, the Blind Monk** ***--487RP*** 


 Lee Sin is one of, if not the most mobile champion in the game, as well as one of the most intricate. With two gap-closers, the ability to hop onto wards, allies, and minions, along with early game burst and an ultimate that's great for peeling and getting kills, He is an excellent champion to snowball early.

He is often played in the top lane and in the jungle, with a rising popularity in mid-lane. 

Due to his diverse kit, he has the ability to play as an assassin (if he gets ahead early), or to build tankier items and act as a peeler in the late game. In most cases, you will end up in the latter option.

*Some effective items on lee sin:*

[](/doransblade) Doran's Blade / [](/doransshield) Doran's Shield

[](/mercurystreads) Mercury's Treads / [](/ninjatabi) Ninja Tabi

[](/thebloodthirster) The Bloodthirster

[](/frozenmallet) Frozen Mallet

[](/mawofmalmortius) Maw of Malmortius

[](/lastwhisper) Last Whisper

[](/guardianangel) Guardian Angel

*Effective summoners:*

[](/flash) Flash - self-explanitory

[](/ignite) Ignite - gives kill potential in top and midlane

[](/exhaust) Exhaust - If you're a man, take this when you jungle instead of flash.

[](/smite) Smite - Are you jungling? take this.

**Update:**
 **NEW THREAD WITH SIGNUPS AND DETAILS: http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/12416r/tasty_tournament_0_will_be_this_saturday_at_1200/**

Hi guys,

I am very interested in running a tournament focused on players who can't quite compete in open tournaments like Go4LoL but still want to play in an organized and competitive setting. I've been kicking around this idea for awhile, and today I figured out more of the logistics and details. I need some feedback on if this sounds awesome or lame, and what I should change/do differently. 

Here is the basic run down:

Format: Best of 1, Double Elimination. Probably looking at 8 teams for the first run, but expand to 16 if there  is interest and see how it goes from there. 

Requirements:

No member may have a highest solo queue elo at or above 1500, and the average of your teams solo queue Elo must be 1400 or lower.
   
 Teams must have 5-7 members on their rosters. Rosters are locked at 12:01 am the day of the tournament.
    
 Each team must have at least one member in the tournament's IRC channel at all times. IRC will be the primary way of communicating between admins and teams.
 
Note: Players without a solo queue rating will be given a default rating of  1200


Prizes: 

Riot points prizes sponsored from Riot. In addition, first place will receive 2 scrims against the Tasty Pastries, with skype meeting and discussion afterwards.

Essentially, I want to run a tournament for you guys that are not gold/plat that would be well run, have extremely clear rules, be competitive and professional, and be fun and a valuable learning experience. 

On a more logistical side, you would register through a google form, which I have set to pull into a spreadsheet that would then filter the eligible teams from the in-eligible and produce the seeded list of teams (by average of your highest solo queue ratings). I would then put these teams in a Challonge bracket and have the winning team's captain update their own games in the bracket. Admins would always be on and reachable if there are any issues. 

I would also like to have some/all of the games be cast. I think that is something I would want to approach after running the tournament successfully once. I think it would be great to take volunteer casters and give them a platform to practice. 

That's about it. I'm posting this here because while this would be an open tournament to the public, I had you guys in mind when I was working with the idea.

 What I need from you: Would you be interested in such a thing? Any feedback on the details? Thanks,

Rakalakalili

Update:

This has gotten a lot of interest already, so it is going to happen. I will make another post later this week with the what, were, when and why. I think I may shoot for Saturday November 3rd as the first shot for the tournament. The only problem is that this may be too soon for Riot Points prizes from Riot.

The new spreadsheet system is well underway, but still not finished.

It is going to be a much more comprehensive spreadsheet this time, and less labour intensive. Being able to select categories you excel at, as well as champs you are good at as well means that students will have better ways of choosing teachers. If anybody makes a mistake or wants to update their row, just PM me and I will delete your old one, and you can take the form again. 

A new rule will be that you have to wait until level 30 to get on the spreadsheet, preferably with over 200 wins, but we won't be enforcing that currently. 

For now, the way you guys can view the spreadsheet is [by going here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0Aigenmvm7j4LdDgtb0dwb1RFQzl0dHlVWUZuYXkxTXc&amp;rm=full#gid=0) and just sorting by the columns they are interested in. Ctrl+F is your friend in this spreadsheet.

We do have a more elaborate search function planned, with students able to select what they want and the spreadsheet spitting out a list of good matches, but this will take a little while to perfect and I figure this is something to start with. This is why the choices are all 1, much easier to do the calculations with 1's and 0's than [](/ahri) and [](/alistar). [SourSkittlez](http://www.reddit.com/user/sourskittlez) is doing a very big chunk of the work on that, so if you are some kind of excel wizard, I'm sure he would appreciate a hand.

We are toying with trying to put together a subreddit Wiki as well, reddit is currently testing out subreddit Wiki's and we think that it will be a great place to keep a lot of the questions that get asked repeatedly. 

I don't have much time to put into it currently, but we will try to get it off the ground so everyone can contribute in the foreseeable future.

There have been a few complaints of lower level players being mistreated in the chatroom, and while it wasn't wildly offensive, its not very nice to the newbies. Please be constructive while in the chatroom, starting arguments and flaming others doesn't help anyone. Drowning out real questions in the circlejerk always concerns me as well, try and cater to all the new players we are getting. Otherwise I will have to harass Tiza about introducing chat room moderation again.

I'm pretty sure this is one thing that, if improved upon, will drastically help your team out. People always say that if you want to have the most impact on your team to play jungle. While this is true, a really good midlane should be able to make just as big of an impact. 

Glance at your minimap often. Map awareness is really important for mid. It will let you make plays. The reason you are mid is that you have a champion that can push a wave very fast and allow you to be elsewhere on the map. If you are staying in lane all game, you aren't taking advantage of being mid lane. If you ward the enemy Wraiths, you can usually keep tabs on the enemy jungler. If your lanes are getting pushed very hard, expect to be camped. Mid lane is hard to gank since the turrets are so close, but if you're the only one winning lane then you are going to be the only target. Keep tabs on your enemy lanes. If your bot lane is having trouble, quickly push your lane and coordinate with your jungler to do a 4v2. If your top lane is having trouble, push your lane and head up there for a gank. Even if it's warded, you have enough time to relieve the pressure on your top lane before you miss any CS. Just like a jungler, you can directly help your teammates lane. You need to take initiative and take advantage of being close to both lanes. 

If you are duo que with your jungler, try to counter jungle more often. Pushing a mid lane, especially after you kill the enemy midlane, will always free up your jungler to counter jungle. The enemy jungler will usually come hold mid and not let the CS die to turrets. Also with your lane pushed, you are in position to follow your jungler into the enemy jungle to steal a buff or catch their jungler in a 2v1. 

Typically farming with an AP mid is very basic. Morganas tormented soil, or Twisted Fates card throws, can kill entire waves with 1 ability. If you want to have the most impact on your team winning, you need to take advantage of that ability and help secure kills for your other lanes and jungler. 

As a mid lane, I highly suggest you don't pick champions just to win lane. Champions like LeBlanc have no pushing power and if your team is not very good, you could easily lose even if you go 5-0 and dominate your lane like a good Leblanc does. That isn't enough when you don't know your teammates. Champions like TF, Morgana, Ahri are all very fast pushers and have some sort of very strong CC that makes for guaranteed ganks. You should be just as active as your jungler in communication. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. Hope it helps someone.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_w9uyz,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/w9uyz/importance_of_map_awareness_and_being_active_on/,

But, I plan on showing you guys a whole new brand of ELO hell.

Now, I do believe I am the ELO I have. Because if I was that much better, I'd be stomping every game.

However, I have another theory.

Currently, I play on the Garena Philippine servers.
And holy fucking shit, everyone is retarded.

Literally the only way people know how to get ahead is to get kills. Hardly a soul, understands the importance of farming, securing buffs, and securing objectives. Hardly anyone understands that THOSE are multiple ways to get back the game.

It's hero mode all day every day, and it is very common to have ""level one bush fighters"". I get them almost every other game.

NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO PLAY SUPPORT. Duo lanes ALWAYS share last hits. Or well, the last hits they go for.

I can 100% assuredly say, I've lost at least five games, because one lane just got raped the fuck out. And no one knows how to handle it.

And then the obvious retort is ""You're the jungler! It's your job to make sure that doesn't happen""

Well, I am remaining adamant that I did my best. Last weeks, there were five games, whose early games I carried so hard. Maintaining pressure on all lanes, and holding perfect scores. Giving kills to the carries, and making sure I secured kills for myself from players I felt were inept.

I actually once carried an Akali to a 5/0/0 score against a Tryndamere, top. Somehow, midgame, he makes a massive comeback. DESPITE, MY CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE LANE.

Why? Because every time I left the goddamn lane, Akali went into 1v1 against Mr.Undying Fucking rage.

Now, some of you may be wondering just where I'm going with this... And this is kind of my ""epiphany"" so far.

Everyone I'm queuing up with are massive fucktards, and idiots who have hardly any to zero game knowledge.

So the way for me to burst outta this hell, is to learn even more and more about the game (with your help summoner school) and carry outta the fucking Jungle, General OddOne style. I want to be able to say that every game I lose, was not my fault. (Obviously, impossible, but you get the idea), I want to build up such a huge base of game knowledge, that will allow me to carry games in which no one has any game knowledge whatsoever; my team mates inluded.

I'm going to start filming MOST of my solo queue losses. And I wanna discuss with people what I did wrong, or what I did good. Or good moves I made, but looking at what BETTER moves I could have made!

I'm also a little excited to show you guys just what the Philippine scene is like. And if I'm just whining, or it's normal for 1.2k ELO games for the jungler to have 180CS at 30 minutes, whereas all the lanes have less than 100 (YES, IT HAS HAPPENED) and the carry on the winning team simply went 20/10/20 kinda shit.

(Because that's how almost every carry in the Philippines ends up carrying)

I'm thinking of this as a sort of ""reverse Day9 Daily""
Where I learn how to be a better gamer. And you learn with me.

Edit:
I'm a little busy with school this week, but I'm hoping to start today/tomorrow.

I just have to learn how to FRAPS everything.

I feel this concept is important enough for newer players to warrant being posted in the actual summoner school reddit. so if i'm out of line posting this i'm sorry :/


Hello my name is nude-fox; I main ad carry.  I’m by no means a good player, but I am going to teach you everything I know about animation canceling. I feel the importance of animation canceling is undervalued, a little bit misunderstood, and not stressed enough when giving newer players pointers. 


What is Animation Canceling and how.

Okay now that I’ve got the awkward introduction out of the way, what is animation canceling exactly? In its most basic concept animation canceling is interrupting your attack animation by giving your champion another command.  You can cancel your attack animation at any time the easiest way to do this is simply give your hero another move command. In general you cannot cancel ability animations, (note if I’m wrong, and you can cancel some qwer animations please let me know and then teach me how).  In general you use animation canceling after your attacks to better reposition your character before your next attack. I’ll use ashe to describe more in depth how this works. 


1.	Ashe has an attack animation. She raises her bow, draws back the string with an arrow, the arrow is released, and then she puts down the bow. 

2.	You can cancel her attack animation at any time immediately by giving her another command such as stop or move. 

3.	After a certain point on all champions their attack ‘registers’ with the server as having taken place. This registration point is not at the very end of the attack animation. For ashe as soon as arrow leaves her bow that attack will register with the server.

4.	Immediately after your attack has reached its registration point you can move or cancel your attack animation and your attack is still guaranteed to hit its target. 

5.	Consciously stopping part of your attack animation to reposition yourself better between auto attacks is what is commonly known as animation canceling. 

*a note on orb walking. Animation canceling and orb walking are often used interchangeably but they are technically different things. Animation canceling is a part of orb walking, but orb walking does not exist in LoL. Orb walking consist of animation canceling plus using a specific mechanic to dota in order to not draw creep agro while auto attacking.  In dota drow ranger has a spell which is basically ashes q but instead of toggling it on and off you have the option to hit q and cast it like an ability. Orb walking involves using an ability like ashes q but without the toggle and casting it on an enemy. After your attack leaves you immediately spam a move command and you will not draw creep agro for your auto attack because the game then treats it similar to an ability in LoL.  Basically proper orb walking makes it so like turning on ashes q would make her not agro creeps.  Also the animation of drow rangers q can be canceled more than her regular autoattack so it helps that way as well. 

.

Animation canceling and its benefits.

Why animation cancel. Well most obviously animation canceling allows you to reposition your character better. If you are being chased you can stop and attack and continue to run away much quicker with animation canceling, or similarly if you are chasing somebody you can cancel some of your attack animation and get extra auto attacks off on your opponent. The proper use of animation canceling and knowing your attack speeds allows you to only ever stop moving for a very specific moment  where you auto attack before you start moving again thus reducing your amount of time standing still and maximizing the amount of time you have to reposition  yourself in team fights. At low elo if you are good at animation canceling this concept is particularly overpowered because even if your lane loses horribly you will still be attacking 2-3x more often than the enemy ad carry who is probably just running back and forth like a chicken with his head cut off half the fight. In general I would say learn how to animation cancel and it will become second nature. 


.

Slightly more advanced concepts/tips. 

Hokay I’m almost done but a few more random things about animation canceling that I feel are worth knowing. If you auto attack and run into a bush before your attack reaches its target you will not draw creep agro. This is pretty good for harassing bottom lane at least you can harass pop into bush and back out to last hitting immediately without worrying about getting any creep agro.  In general you can cancel the attack animations of ranged characters as soon as the projectile materializes. So for like ezrael as soon as the projectile appears you can move you don’t need to wait for it to leave ezrael’s body. An exception to this that I know of is corki. You can actually cancel corki’s attack after his projectile has left, though I wouldn’t worry about it too much because the timing is very tight. For melee characters it’s much easier you can move as soon as you see that little damage tick, you don’t even need to finish your entire forward swing sometimes. This is especially noticeable on Alistair who you can cancel after a wimpy half swing or so.

I will highlight some of the changes that made this change occur.

- New doran's shield

With the new doran's shield, Vladimirs early game has become a lot less difficult. Starting with Doran's almost guarantees you a decent laning phase which is what Vlad needs.

- Spirit Visage

With the recent changes to spirit visage, it gives Vladimir exactly the stats that he needs. Cooldown reduction, health and the passive go a long way on vladimir. The new build path is also helpful laning against an AP Top.

- Spirit of the Spectral Wraith

Spirit of the Spectral Wraith is stupidly strong on Vladimir. Cooldown reduction AND spell vamp? What could go wrong? Not to mention it is insanely good for wave clear at later levels (after 2 or 3 points in E).

- Seeker's Armguard

Allows for easy access to armour with a good build path against a strong AD lane such as riven, zed or kha'zix. Makes laning against them a bit easier for Vlad.





Another thing people forget is how much 12% increases damage really does. You might not notice it but Vlad ult can be a huge game changer. I'm expecting to see a lot more vlad with these changes. The build I take on Vlad is usually a spirit item rush in to spirit visage, building seekers armguard if needed. I then build zhonyas then situationally.

This is a personal preference but I like to take full health runes and start doran's shield and a pot in some lanes. Some lanes I will take hybrid pen marks/quints with armour and a mix of flat MR and MR/lvl blues. Against heavy AD Lanes I may opt to take flat armour marks and seals. Usually for masteries I go 21/9 or 9/21 depending on the lane opponent. This is all personal preference, feel free to try your own combinations.

I can't even remember the last time I didn't play support so I picked up Rengar the other day and tried him out in a few bot games. It was really fun and going in top lane was a nice break from dealing with adc's all the time.

My problem is, I want to try top during normal pvp games, but 95% of the time I end up taking support at the risk of having a shitty bot lane. I'm always the first to concede top in order to play bot and whenever I say ""pref top but can play supp"" it always ends up with me playing support since no one else will. Other times people will just instalock a top champion even after I called it and I switch for the sake of team comp.
It's so frustrating because it's in my nature to put what everyone else wants to play before myself but sometimes I just wanna be firm and say ""No. Even though I can play support, I would really like to stay top"" but then I'm just met with ""fuk u fagit i got top"" 

The worst part is, I don't even know if I'm good at top and if I do badly when somebody else wanted top people will just say ""lol i shouldve went top noob, report swigganicks for feeding"" How the shit am I supposed to practice then? Bot games are wayyy to easy and aren't helpful beyond getting used to basic mechanics/builds of champions.

There's also the issue of most people just sucking at support, especially if they're forced to play it because their role was taken. No ward placement, ks'ing, etc. I feel like I'd rather just play support myself than let someone who doesn't want too.

1372827826.0,30,self.summonerschool,1hjs42,Tips to climb out of bronze/silver up to low golds quickly (for ADCs mainly),rhead42,44,14,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1hjs42/tips_to_climb_out_of_bronzesilver_up_to_low_golds/,"So, every time someone comes up with questions about how to gain elo or improve at the game especially from the ADC position, there are a few basic skills that get thrown in their faces - things like last hitting and map awareness. The thing is, it's not feasible to get better at last hitting overnight - doing CS/kiting drills for 10 minutes a day got really dull for me when I could play maybe 2 games a day after work, so I watched a bunch of videos and talked to some people and came up with some tricks that will let you abuse certain things about bronze and silver players and let you artificially inflate your elo/division. 

I just want to note - these things will not make you a better player, but in my case, having the instant gratification of seeing myself move up provided the motivation to continue improving my skills through the methods everyone else uses. I made a brand new account on the SEA server in january - got placed in Bronze 4 and tricks like these took me to plat 5. In terms of actual skill, I don't think I'm a plat player - while playing against other plat/diamonds I often get crushed; which leads me to believe I'm a mid gold player at best. A lot of these I got from the leaguecraft series of videos and a rather dashing gentleman called u/seanp so kudos to those people.

1. Pick a hyper carry. Vayne is my favourite. Don't pick ez/graves/draven - because they don't have the ability to chunk through really fed bruisers (you will have to do this roughly once in every 3 games) Kogmaw would work but I am still a crappy kogmaw so I don't have much experience playing him. Tristana is good, but she doesn't have the ability to capitalize on your enemy's mistakes that vayne does. Plus Vayne hits power spikes much faster than trist does. 
Picking a hyper carry is risky, but at lower elo's noone knows how to punish you for picking weak early game champions. 

2. Play hyper aggressive. People are bitches at low elo. you get up in their face and 9 times out of 10 their fist instinct is to run away. Do this a couple of times and they're either dead or forced to back. Yes this means you will fuck up at first - you will get blitz hooked, will get jungler ganked, you will find inventive, stupid ways to die every single game. Eventually though you will learn how to use controlled aggression. (Dlift's razer vayne guide is a great example of controlled aggression). For the moment, if the aggression works you just win lane. Being a fed vayne at 20 minutes will inspire surrenders. 

3. Be a scumbag. Firstly, ignore your team. most of them are either trolling or so frustrated that they're looking for an excuse to flame and rage at you. Try to communicate with your support but if he's useless (and a lot of them will be), let him do his own thing. Play the lane like he doesn't exist. Never make a play that relies on your support to do something. Anything your support does to help you is a bonus. He's under no obligation to help you. 
Secondly, try and get your team to make plays around 20 minutes (this is actually one of QueenTerra's soloq tips - I don't know if he's around summoner school anymore). If you won lane hard, and get dragon and a tower at the 20 minute mark, or ace their team or get a triple/quadra kill - type a GG in all chat. Remember that people in bronze and silver are not calm, collected people - they're frustrated as hell and probably flaming their adc for feeding the vayne anyway. BM will either seriously demotivate the enemy team, or piss them off and make them tilt.  (Rarely this will not do either, but who cares you're a fed vayne)

4. Ward dragon. if your support doesn't do it, buy a ward with your first back and do it. at bronze elo, whether junglers come via river or tri bush - 90% of them will just walk by dragon. a ward in dragon and a ward in tribush is all the wards you need at a time in lane phase. (warding the lane is only important if you're scared of a lane gank/ of a support like blitz/thresh). When you're first pick - ban at least 1 of those, if not both. Blitzcrank is a noob magnet - you will always get matched with that sona that 'accidentally' got hooked cuz she only plays top lane and doesn't know how to play against a blitz

5. Push the lane. I still can't hit 100 cs at 10 minutes reliably. Pushing the lane means two things - first he's CSing against the tower so he's going to loose CS - at bronze and silver it means he's going to be close to something like 40 cs at 10 minutes (hopefully you'll have 60-70 at the very least). The second advantage ties into playing hyper aggressive. Your enemy laner can't do shit if he's pushed to tower all the time. You also can't get lane ganked because you'll see the jungler coming from a mile away. Pushing also lets you build up large minion waves at his tower - which means you win every trade. Even if you eat a tower shot - say you condemn him against his tower while he's last hitting, you get free damage on him, he misses more cs. Worst case scenario you eat an auto and a tower shot (or an ability and a tower shot) but then your minion wave will aggro him and he'll eat more damage. If you're running lifesteal quints, you can afford to eat the tower shot now and then. 

6. Play support. Soloq being what it is, often you're not going to get ADC. Rather than taking a solo lane or jungle(which are incredibly different roles to play because the lanes work very differently) pick support - not only does this keep your team morale higher (Noone flaming about having to play support) but also, seeing what mistakes other AD's do at your elo makes you recognize flaws in your own play and gives you a better idea of what your support is able to do. Play a few sona games and you'll realize it isn't easy to aim her Q to hit only champions, so you'll be more understanding if she accidentally takes a few CS in lane. Playing Blitz will teach you that the hook is hard to land and can have devastating consequences if you miss it. 


That's it. These are the things I did to gain elo fast. I reiterate these will not make you a better player  - you still want to do the cs drills and improve your map awareness and learn all the matchups, all the things people do to get better at the game - but seeing elo gain gives me the motivation to do the boring things that make me a better player. 


Edit : For everyone saying not to play vayne at Bronze elo. I don't agree. I played vayne at low elo. She's a great duelist and punishes positioning mistakes really hard. She's a pubstomper. In my soloq career - for my first account back in october 2012 I turned 30 and started playing ranked, I ended up around 900 elo and oscillated b/w 900 and 1.1k for all of season 2. At the start of season 3 I made an account on SEA (because I moved my IRL country of residence) and was placed into Bronze 4 there and was able to carry myself upto plat 5 playing Vayne, Trist(if vayne was picked), alistar and soraka by using these tricks. I don't think Im a plat level player - and at some point these tricks will stop working and I'll be forced to focus harder on actually improving my skills. Like I've mentioned I still can't hit perfect CS reliably - it's something I'm working on.

1371495115.0,29,self.summonerschool,1gj61j,Kha'Zix evolutions with 3.8,Watchman304,37,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gj61j/khazix_evolutions_with_38/,"So, I love playing Kha'Zix. He's one of my favorite champions, both in the jungle and in lane. In the 3.8 patch, his lane presence took a pretty big hit, but the evolution of taste their fear was buffed significantly. As I understand it, the evolution of spike racks no longer consumes the ""unseen threat"" buff from his passive, but is otherwise unchanged. The additional damage and slow made Kha'Zix a serious threat in lane, with great sustain, poke, and great burst/all-in. With the nerf to evolved spike racks, he doesn't lose much sustain, but his poke and burst took a pretty big hit.

On the other hand, evolved enlarged claws got a pretty big buff. With enlarged claws, Kha'Zix's Q (taste their fear) now deals additional damage based on the target's missing health, regardless of whether or not he/she is isolated (the ability still deals additional damage to isolated targets, but the evolution no longer relies on separating your enemies). This makes it a better finishing move, allowing you to clean up more easily after a fight and get quick resets on your leap if you evolve wings.

So, now I ask you all what you think of his evolutions. In The jungle I typically evolve wings first for better ganks and improved mobility overall. It lets me move between camps more quickly by taking shortcuts more easily, and it's a great evolution. Next I typically take spikes, for obvious reasons. My last evolution is usually on my ult, because that third stealth and damage reduction is just too good to pass up. When laning, I usually evolve spikes, then active camouflage, then wings. 

I would never evolve claws, because I simply didn't have a reason to. Now, it actually seems like a situationally viable pick. I need some advice on evolutions to fit my playstyle. I rarely build defensive items on Kha'Zix, I just go for maximum slipperyness. I'll take alacrity CDR boots and zephyr for movement, and the rest is just AD, Armor Pen, and a little Lifesteal in most of my games, relying on stealth, leap, flash, and movespeed to avoid death. For this reason I will always evolve active camo and wings in 100% of my games, because the utility of these evolutions are too good for me to pass up. Before 3.8, I would always take spikes with one of my evolution points, completely ignoring claws. Now, I'm not sure which to use. I'm thinking of evolving claws in the jungle to finish off champions more easily while ganking, and to clear camps by killing off the lesser monsters first and using the bonus damage from isolation and missing health to take down the bigger ones, but I'd miss out on some of the sustain from the extra void spike projectiles.

***
***
***Akali***

These two changes are intended to give Akali's kit some utility. With Twilight Shroud now granting vision where it's placed, Akali can perform interesting jungle and lane jukes by first casting Twilight Shroud to gain vision of an enemy or jungle monster, and then using Shadow Dance as an escape tool. Overall, it should be a cool little trick that adds some depth to this ability.

Twilight Shroud  
Now grants vision in the area of effect  

Shadow Dance  
Essence of Shadow charge time reduced to 30/22.5/15 seconds from 35/25/15

***

***Caitlyn***

Caitlyn was crowding out a lot of other AD champions with her potent siege capabilities and strong lane trading potential. We wanted to highlight her weakness to extended trades as a sniper by reducing her base attack speed.

Additionally, by removing the accrual of headshot stacks when attacking turrets, it'll be a little more difficult for Caitlyn to perpetually siege towers in early game while zoning out enemies with the threat of a headshot.


Base Attack Speed reduced to 0.625 from 0.668  
Attack Speed per level increased to 4% from 3%  

Headshot  
No longer gains stacks when attacking structures
 
***

***Cassiopeia***

Twin Fang  
Now counts as a single target spell for the sake of items like Rylai's Crystal Scepter

***

***Diana***

As a melee champion, Diana should have an inherent weakness to lane harass. These changes are to reduce some of the safe and efficient wave clear Diana was getting from auto-attacking with her shield up in lane.

The shield change will help Diana in mid- to late-game team fights when she needs to dive into multiple enemies to engage. Before the changes, Diana's shield refreshed almost immediately and she got no benefit from the first stack unless she took damage very quickly upon initiating. Now with her shields stacking on top of each other, Diana will gain a little more survivability in these kind of engagements.

Moonsilver Blade  
Damage reduced to 20/25/30/35/40/50/60/70/80/90/105/120/135/155/175/200/225/250 (+0.6 Ability Power) from 20/25/30/40/50/65/80/95/110/125/140/155/175/195/215/240/265/290 (+0.6 Ability Power)  
Range of the cleave behind Diana reduced  

Pale Cascade  
Total damage changed to 66/102/138/174/210 from 60/105/150/195/240  
Shield reduced to 40/55/70/85/100 (+0.3 Ability Power) from 55/80/105/130/155 (+0.45 Ability Power)  
The second application of the shield now stacks with the first shield instead of replacing it  
 
***

***Elise***

Removing the bonus Armor and Magic Resist in Spider Form while increasing the ability power ratio on Skittering Frenzy will better position Elise's offensive capabilities and vulnerabilities. Elise continues to be a very strong lane bully; she will just need to think carefully about when she can win a trade.

Skittering Frenzy  
Ability Power ratio increased to 0.04 from 0.02  

Spider Form  
No longer grants bonus Armor and Magic Resist

***Karma***

Inner Flame  
Mantra Bonus - Soulflare  
Slow area now spawns directly under the primary target  

***
 
***Miss Fortune***

Miss Fortune excels at trading in lanes, but her Impure Shots were building too quickly and dealing too much burst damage with the use of Double Up. With this change, Miss Fortune loses some of her burst potential, but will do around the same damage in extended trades.

Impure Shots  
Passive  
Max stacks increased to 5 from 4  
Damage per stack reduced to 4/6/8/10/12 from 6/8/10/12/14

***Mordekaiser***

***Nami***

These general usability buffs are for Nami to feel more impactful in team fights and skirmishes. In particular, with Surging Tides giving more movement speed and Aqua Prison having a longer stun duration, Nami players should feel better about playing aggressive in a lane.

Basic Attack Missile Speed increased to 1500 from 1350  

Surging Tides  
Bonus Movement Speed increased to 40 from 30  

Aqua Prison  
Stun duration increased to 1.5 seconds from 1.25  
 
***

***Nunu***

Nunu naturally fits in the jungle with his strong objective control and high map mobility – these changes should add more depth within that role. Above all, we want Consume to be a cool spell –Consume has traditionally languished in late game for everything besides objective control, so making it an attractive spell with these changes adds more depth and rank-up incentive.

Consume  
Damage increased to 600/700/800/900/1000 from 500/600/700/800/900  
Healing reduced to 90/130/170/210/250 from 125/180/235/290/345  
Healing ratio reduced to 0.75 from 1.0  
Consume now grants bonuses for 120/150/180/210/240 seconds based on the type of monster consume was used on:  
&gt;Golem-type monsters grant 10% increased size and maximum Health  
&gt;Lizard-type monsters grant Nunu's attacks and spells additional magic damage equal to 1% of Nunu's maximum Health  
&gt;Wraith or Wolf-type monsters grant 15% movement speed for 3 seconds after Nunu kills a unit

***Rumble***

We did tone down some of Rumble's overall damage, but we also took this opportunity to make Danger Zone more impactful in Rumble's overall play. Here we've decided to increase his benefits for staying in the Danger Zone, so Rumble players will have more incentive to carefully manage their abilities.

Flamespitter  
Damage decreased to 75/135/195/255/315 (+1.0 Ability Power) from 90/160/230/300/370 (+1.35 Ability Power)  
Danger Zone damage bonus increased to 50% from 25%  

Electro-Harpoon  
Damage decreased to 45/70/95/120/145 (+0.4 Ability Power) from 55/85/115/145/175 (+0.5 Ability Power)  

***

***Syndra***

Scatter the Weak  
Improved detection of Dark Spheres at longer ranges  

***

***Twisted Fate***

With his huge global map pressure in early and mid-game, we wanted to reduce Twisted Fate's overall power without hitting the core components that make him fun. We're changing the passive cooldown reduction on Stacked Deck to attack speed to take out some of the free power he was getting without much gameplay interaction. Additionally, given Destiny's high impact, we've brought it more in line with other global ability cooldowns

Pick a Card  
Blue card now restores 50/75/100/125/150 Mana instead of 26/39/52/65/78 (+0.6 total Attack Damage)  

Stacked Deck  
No longer grants Cooldown Reduction  
Bonus Attack Speed increased to 10/15/20/25/30% from 3/6/9/12/15%  

Destiny  
Cooldown increased to 180/150/120 seconds from 150/135/120  
Tooltips updated

***Udyr***

Tiger Stance  
Fixed a bug that caused Tiger Strike to only apply in the first 5 seconds of the stance  

***

***Varus***

Hail of Arrows makes Varus very strong in lane trades and zoning enemies out, but the strength of this ability was crowding out the intended use of Piercing Arrow as a high-damage snipe. With these changes, Hail of Arrows still has its strength in area control but it no longer completely trumps Piercing Arrow as a method of proccing Blighted Quiver and dealing high burst damage.

Base Movement Speed reduced to 330 from 335  

Piercing Arrow  
Minimum damage increased to 10/47/83/120/157 from 10/43/77/110/143  
Maximum damage increased to 15/70/125/180/235 from 15/65/115/165/215  
Improved hit detection at the end of the missile  

Hail of Arrows  
Damage reduced to 65/100/135/170/205 from 65/105/145/185/225  

Chain of Corruption  
Improved hit detection at the end of the missile  

***

***Warwick***

These are mostly quality of life changes for Warwick, who actually spent more time channeling Infinite Duress than he spent suppressing his target. Additionally, the fact that Warwick will now always place himself in front of the target rather than in a random location around them should add a little more strategic depth to who he suppresses and when.

Infinite Duress  
Channel time reduced to 1.5 seconds from 2.1 (the target is still suppressed for the full 1.8 seconds)  
Infinite Duress now always places Warwick in front of the target rather than a random spot around the target  

***

***Zac***

For all of the utility and sustain he brings, Zac was just a little too strong across the board. These changes should tone him down in places where he had excessive power – reducing the burst power of his ultimate and his already unusually high sustain from bloblets.

Base Health Regen reduced to 7.0 from 12.5  

Let's Bounce!  
Damage reduced to 140/210/280 from 160/240/320  
Fixed a bug where Let's Bounce! was applying a 0.25 Ability Power ratio on every bounce rather than 0.4 on the first bounce, halved on subsequent bounces  
Tenacity reduced to 50% from 75%  

***

***Zed***

As a resourceless champion, Zed was able to farm efficiently and safely without giving his opponent much opportunity for interaction. These changes should hit his wave clearing efficiency, especially at early levels. The vision reduction on Zed's Living Shadow was just to bring it more in line with other abilities of this type.

Razor Shuriken  
Damage dealt to secondary targets reduced to 45/69/93/117/141 (+0.6 bonus Attack Damage) from 60/92/124/156/188 (+0.8 bonus Attack Damage)  

Living Shadow  
Vision radius of the Shadow reduced to 700 from 1300  

Shadow Slash  
Cooldown increased to 4 seconds from 3

**Items**

***Mana Manipulator***  

Recipe changed: Faerie Charm + 120 gold = 300 total gold  
Mana Warp Passive Aura reduced to 5 Mana Regen per 5 seconds from 6  
 

***Mikael's Crucible***  

Mikael's Crucible is a very strong item for supports who want to stay on the back line out of harm's way. Most supports, however, opt for Philosopher's Stone in early game, which makes them adverse to buying another high-sustain item like Mikael's Crucible. These changes also open up more diversity for supports when upgrading their Philosopher's Stone - Shurelya's offers more offensive and defensive disengage, but Mikael's Crucible offers more in-fight potential.

Recipe changed: Philosopher's Stone + Chalice of Harmony + 920 gold = 2500 total cost  
Grants 7 Health Regen per 5 seconds from 0  
Grants 18 Mana Regen per 5 seconds from 9  
No longer grants Mana  
Active Heal changed to ""Heals for 150 + 10% of the target's Maximum Health"" from ""Heals for 150 + 15% of the target's Missing Health"", Cleanse effect unchanged

Summoner's Rift

While this change doesn't seem significant, it will help auto-attack reliant laners when trading against ability-based laners. Champions who rely on lane harassment through abilities typically don't draw minion attacks as much as auto-attack champions, and this disparity was forcing a lot of champions to opt for high-sustain starts in order to compensate. This change will have a larger overall effect on lane trading as the game progresses.

HOW DO I COUNTER RUMBLE!?,Darthob,43,16,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1druvb/how_do_i_counter_rumble/,"There is no champion (except for MAYBE Hecarim) that I hate more in the entire game. Rumble has mobility, sustain, CC and a MASSIVE damage output, all without being constricted to building pure AP items. He builds tanky with Liandry's and Rylai's, but still deals enough damage to out anyone from lane. His abilities have absolutely nothing to keep him from spamming all lane and grow stronger the more he spams.

How the hell am I to deal with him in lane? I swear to God. If I could bring any fictional character to life, it would be the Yordle. I'd want him to live, and be real, tangible. I'd want him to experience the whole spectrum emotion and feeling. All so I could DROP KICK HIM IN HIS FUCKING FACE.

This time I'll be writing about the importance of saving your blinks/dashes/escapes or any form of escape or initiation ability that you may have in your kit.

**The Importance of Saving Blinks/Dashes/Escapes**

What I mean by saving your blinks/dashes/escapes is that by using your blinks/dashes/escapes appropriately, i.e. saving it for when the enemy champion uses his/her's to get away, that is **IF** you know that your enemy has a blink/dash/escape of his/her own kit, will allow you to catch them and potentially kill them.

E.g. You're Katarina, coming doing from Top Lane to gank an enemy Lee Sin, who's in Mid Lane. now instead of going in for your standard combo, Q + E + W + R, you only use Q to poke, for you know that Lee Sin will Safeguard away to safety, yet you'll still be able to ""jump"" to him with your Shunpo, so that you have the potential to kill him, with your combo. **Patience** is key here, remember that. 

 * This also applies to enemy champions who have some form of hard CC that may allow him/her to get away, e.g. Lux's Q Light Binding, Ryze's Rune Prison, Kassadin's Silence, etc.

**Important** - It also helps immensely if you know whether or not the enemy has his/her Flash up, for ht can determine whether or not he/she dies, for **sometimes** even with his/her form of blinks/dashes/escapes is not enough, if you learn to save your blinks/dashes/escapes. 

I hoped this guide helped some people. As always, you're all welcome to comment below on if I missed something important, elaborate on anything I said, or correct me if I messed up on something. Remember, if you do, you'll not only be helping me out, but be helping out with the rest of the community as well. Thanks ahead!

I have been playing this game for about 2 years and finally started ranked in season 2. I instantly fell down to 1k elo and was very dissapionted and didn't understand why i was there. 

This subreddit helped me a lot with keeping a good attitude and little tips and tricks I could use. using this I was able to hit 1300 elo by then end of Season 2 which was a huge acomplishment for me at the time since I thought I would be stuck at 1000 elo the whole time.

Then Season 3 came around and I really wanted to hit gold, so i browsed this subreddit as much as I could picking up tips and adding people to help me out. I found out that I actually loved bot lane and just started focusing all my games into adc or support. Many people helped me through this and I can now prodly say that today I hit goldV!

Just want to say thanks again and I don't think I could of made it if it was not for summonschool. I hope you all can reach your goals and if you want to ask for help or tips I am willing to try and help since others helped so much for me.

I have to say that this sub has a lot to teach for new people joining league, great tip and advices to make everyone a better player. I am lvl 23 and if it wasn't for what i learned here i would have stoped playing it a long time ago.

What I am thinking is, we all know that normal games are way different than ranked ones, and this can make the player grow some habits that will crush him in ranked and reading and understanding an advice isn't (at least for me) the same as doing it on game, because every game is different and a good lol player should know how to be flexible.

So what if we create a sub linked to the sidebar or something that a player could put a replay so others could criticize.

Something to people between level 25-30, low elos, players that know what they are doing, but have a lot to improve.

It would have rules so it doesn't get oversaturated with replays and I think it's a good way to approach players that want to get better.

So tell me what you think of the idea.

As a jungler, you can definitely take advantage of this.
Successfully gank who ever gave up first blood, and a good portion of teams will just crumble.
Gank a lane three times, and even if you're not successful, they'll start complaining to their jungler, which will give you an easier dragon.
Kill the support more than once, and the AD carry will start raging, disrupting bot lane chemistry and allowing your bot to start rolling.

So lets begin:

1. Who's idea was it to have more than 2 casters? I watched a majority of the matches, and in all of them, Caster A would do 50% of the casting, Caster B would do 40% of the casting, and remaining casters made up the last 10%. This is a problem. Why have someone there, if they're only going to say a handful of sentences in a match (half of which were irrelevant to the match). The reason two casters are commonly used is due to the interaction between social groups. If we look at basic human social construct, we see that two people will happily converse about a topic. Add a third, and the conversation gets disjointed and confusing, due to the different tangents people can go off on. Add a fourth, and you're entering ""the dead zone"", where one person is shunned, and almost never participates, while the other three continue the confusion, and irrelevant tangents. Any more than this, and you get ""the crowd effect"", whereby one or two people talk, and everyone else listens for fear of interrupting someone else. Two casters is the most efficient way of casting, the end.

2. Why is the ""directed camera"" function NOT being used? The directed camera function is designed to capture ALL important events in a sequential prioritization of match changing events? Countless times the cast was staring at a blank river, blank minion camp or blank spawn pool when objectives were being taken, plays were being made, and champions were dying due to NOT using a function which would be far better than staring at an empty wraith camp. Use the tools you have to optimize the casting, and not miss crucial game changing events.

3. Background music. This in itself isnt a problem. The problem comes up when the casting voice program fades the music in and out when people are talking. This becomes an irritating droan of syllables and disjointed harmonies which distracts from the actual cast. Find a way to either have music at a constant volume, or remove it all together, because it really does lose you viewers to migraines (I for one got one after about 2 minutes of disjointed musical lyrics and mincing of chorus'. The music, fix it or bin it.

4. Reverbbbbbb.....bbbbbbb.....bbbbbb. Casters sem to have some kind of reverb going on, where they say something and a fraction of a second later their voice says the same thing, but in a much lower tone. It's like listening to stephen hawkings mimic a shoutcast. This distracts from the cast itself, and is quite annoying when you notice it. Again, can lose you viewers to people who get off on stephen hawkings voices. Reverb of voices, needs attention.

5. More passion. Casters need to bring something special. Sitting there talking about what is happening, is fine, but it doesnt get you viewers. You know why korean are famous for casting video games? cuz they get into it. PEEENNTTTAAA KKIRRRRLLL is a common scream now, thanks to koreans, passionate koreans. I'm not saying scream your face off, but you need to be original, you need to be unique, you need to bring something to the table. If you wanna get excited and throw in a PEEENNNTTTAAA KIRRRLLL, then shit be my guest, I'll love it. But if you have FIVE casters, and a really cool play is made, and all I hear is ""oh that was cool, well done"" or ""good job by blue team"", I'm far more inclined to go watch Dyrus heal bait an Alistar into towerdiving him, and listening to his cackle of a laugh that follows. IF you're going to have a mountain of casters, make it interesting. Impose a rule of sorts, that each caster will represent a champ, and when that champ gets a multikill, said caster has to be very excited and voice that excitement to the audience. This allows you to have multiple casters, and includes them all, and allows them opportunity to say something once in a blue moon. You want viewers, then bring some cookies to the table.

6. Massive delays. In the time one match finished, and another started, I have written all of this. Considering I'm writing this while talking on LoL, doing a project for work, and having my lunch, thats about 15-20 minutes of gap between games. That is significantly massive. You essentially have two options here. A) Fill in this time with prepared content or B) shorten the delays a lot. While both of these would be ideal, the first is probably the easiest. It's not hard t go and find something amusing that is LoL related, or even not LoL related. Maybe a video, or a song can play while everything is sorted out, instead of a bunch of casters shit-talking (thats talking about irrelevant issues to those who arent familiar with military lingo). Viewers dont want to hear it. They want to be entertained. So amuse them, instead of losing them.

There's my two cents on how you can improve the casting of SNS. You may like it, you may not. But at least I said what everyone else is thinking. Now you know.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,badge-kiwi,True,t3_tlsp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tlsp4/problems_i_have_with_sns_casting/,

First of all let me address something that has been bothering me for some time. The metagame is what it is because people have found out that consistantly it works the best, that being at least one AD and one AP ""carry"" to do damage, with some ""tanks"" and supports protecting these carries. However, the meta does not have to be followed. You can have 5 carries, you can have 5 tanks, or anything in between. Now lets get into some details:

**TANKS**
Ok, first of all, nothing pisses me off more than people asking in champ select, ""who go tank?!?"" In LoL, there are maybe 3 champs total who are pure tanks. And when I say pure tanks, I mean your classic MMO ""do no damage cc everything auras for everyone."" This is the main reason I'm writing this. Champs in League are either innately tanky or they are not. This does not mean the champs that are tanky should build tank items! Take Jarvan IV for example (mah main jungler), you can build him damage oriented and still have him be tankier than your carries, while still doing damage. In fact, many ""tanks"" build damage, or have damage built into their kit (like Mundo, Shyvanna). Instead of calling champs tanks, it is more appropriate to call then ""tanky"", and that they will ""tank"" for your team, that is take the most damage and be on the front line in a teamfight.

Building damage onto tanky players usually makes them what we like to call ""bruisers"". It is a bruisers job to get past the enemy front line to the carries, since they can both survive the damage being put out by the enemy team, and deal enough damage to either zone the carries out of the fight or kill them outright. Currently we're in the ""bruiser meta"", where normally every team has a bruiser top lane, in the jungle, or both.

The only ""full tanks"" in this game right now IMO are Leona, Sejuani, Nautilus, and Volibear. These are the only champs that don't really scale well with damage, and are mostly utility and thrive off of only building tank items and throwing out a shit ton of cc.

**Carrying**

So, everybody, at some point in the game, has the potential to carry. Some champs need damage items to carry, others can build bruiser and still carry. Bruisers and AP carries usually ""carry"" early and mid game, while AD carries ""carry"" the late game, just do to the sheer damage they can put out.

One thing you have to remember, since it is a ""tanks"" job to get to the carries, **LATE GAME CARRIES ARE TANK KILLERS*. That's right, everybody says ""focus the carries"", but you can't kill them if you keep dying to bruisers. You might be thinking ""But Dom, they have SOOOOO much resistance!"" (armor/mr). Well, at this point in the game you should have a Last Whisper for armor, and a Void Staff for mr. The more armor and mr they stack when you have these, the less effective their mitigation becomes.


So just remember this when you're playing League, and start rolling face.



*EDIT* I forgot to include Rammus in the ""pure tank"" category. You could argue that Shen is in this as well, but I think that he does enough damage to be considered a bruiser.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,True,,badge-caster,True,t3_sur55,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/sur55/tanking_and_carryingwhat_it_means_to_you/,

(And how to climb the Elo Ladder),Xaevier,38,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/s8i1n/an_analysis_of_champion_efficiency_based_on_your/,"X-post from [leagueoflegends Main reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/s8hcl/an_analysis_of_champion_efficiency_and_choices/)

Heya folks, Taenshi here (just kidding &lt;3 Studio)



I’m a 2k+ player, I tend to bounce around 2000-2150 and I have been teaching 3 of my friends how to climb up the elo ranks lately and thought I would write some of this down and see if it helps anyone. (they all went from about 1400 to 1700s)



I see a LOT of posts from people who struggle to raise their Elo but say they are playing the right champions, and have the concepts of the game down correctly. I think a big part of this issue is simply that very few people take into consideration the champion they pick based on the Elo they are at.



What does this mean?



Well have you ever stopped to consider why champions like Shy, Mundo, or Kogmaw do so well in tournaments? The key thing is that these champions take advantage of the player attitude at that level of play, which is very few mistakes, high farm, low aggression.



A player can pick a farm/late game champion because they know that the enemy team is going to have few openings and rarely over-extend or put themselves in bad spots.



So this means you should learn Shy, Kogmaw, Mundo, Ashe, Karthus, Poppy, Singed and every other champion that you see played in streams right? Actually no, the champions you see streamed at high levels of solo queue and tournament level play often flat out don’t work at certain levels of the Elo ladder.


____**Let’s section off the different Elo stages so we have an idea where we stand**___



**0-1100 Elo** – Mostly trolls, ragers, afkers, dcers. A lot of games are decided based on who has the afker. Commonly called “Elo Hell” Troll saturation is 50%

**1200-1450 Elo** – People are starting to figure out how to play, you have brand new players, aspiring higher level players who try complex things, watch tournaments, and generally want to get better. I would say troll saturation is about 15-30%

**1500-1800 Elo** – Players tend to have 1-2 roles they play and don’t know much beyond that, you see a heavy mix of good and bad in here. Map awareness isn’t very good but it’s improving and most people try to copy things they saw pros do, but have poor execution. 5-15% troll saturation

**1900-2200 Elo** – Honestly my favorite elo. Everyone can do 3-4 roles, they have their preferences but don’t really care if they have to do something else too badly. You rarely ever see a blatant troll and if you do it tends to be more a grudge thing (you always play with the same people at this point) Troll saturation 1-5%

**2200+ Elo** – This is what you see streamed, these are the games people take to heart, and honestly everyone knows this one. Games aren’t taken very seriously, things degenerate badly as people get bored of long queues and play whatever they want and often half the players don’t care if they lose. Famous players are your worst nightmare at this point as they care the least and will just dick around the whole game. Troll saturation 30-40%

So what does all of that mean to you? Well each Elo is an entirely different game as far as what is good or bad. 



**Lets Get down to it, What should be your strategy?**



**0-1100 Elo** - Elo hell you have to player hyper carries who can 1v5 the enemy team and farm based champions are nearly useless since the game will often be swinging in the favor of one team by a factor of 10-30 kills by the 20 minute mark. At this point champions like Leblanc, Morgana, Twitch, Xin, Renekton, Graves, Vayne, Yi, Fiora, Lee Sin etc, are the strongest. You have to basically never farm minions and always farm champions because if you don’t you risk your team getting killed constantly. Also you will have to learn how to 1v2 in a lane well. 

**TLDR: Gank a lot, don’t pick farm champions**

**1200-1450:** Ok, so you can go back to farming your lane but you still need gank heavy champions. Things like Teleport Morgana, Sion, Kassadin, Ahri or anyone else that can go between lanes and get kills is a good choice. This is because your enemies have enough intelligence to not let you kill them that easily when you are laning versus them, but they also lack the map awareness to call MIAs and watch other lanes. Thus if you teleport behind a pushing bot as Morgana….Double kills all day on CD. Champions to avoid are those who are heavy late game or have poor escapes.

**TDLR: Learn to cross lane gank, farm inbetween you need an even mix of CS/Kills to win.**

**1500-1800:**Ok so people are starting to make sure you can’t just walk from top to bot killing everything in your path just because you aren’t their “Lane enemy” and they didn’t expect you to come. I still recommend you try things like Morgana/Sion but be prepared for counter picks and it to start failing. At this point you want to gank often but you more so want to start controlling the enemy jungle, level 1 invading, and winning 5v5s instead of relying on 20 minute surrenders. Morgana is still good, Sion will start to fall off, Renekton, Olaf, WW will beat most top lanes, Nocturne/Skarner/Mundo are good jungles as they have speed and can pressure lanes heavily (people at this point get extremely paranoid about ganks if you hit them once at level 2 or 3 and just terrorize them). Bot lane you want to stick with aggressive supports/AD and be careful about picking Ashe or Kogmaw unless you are duo queueing with your friend on support.

**TLDR: People are getting smarter, still avoid farm to win champions, and focus on winning team fights, dragons, barons, and learn how to counter jungle some**

**1900-2200:** Games are won and lost based on counters. Everyone knows what beats what and it gets really tough here. The easiest way to win now is to focus on speed junglers, whatever support counters their bot lane, and whatever mid counters their mid. The best way to get high Elo here is to learn a weird champion as nobody will know what to counter it with. Lulu top, poppy, Fizz jungle, Jarvan top, Urgot bot, Fiora mid. Anything and everything that makes people scratch their heads (provided it works, don’t go too crazy and put Leona top or anything ridiculous) Another great thing to do is learn champions with multiple roles as they won’t feel comfortable 100% counter-picking if you pick Jarvan or Lulu (Is that a jungle jarvan or a top, is that mid top or support lulu!?!)

**TLDR: Learn weird shit, play consistently, get elo**

**2200+:** Get a magic eight ball that’s going to give you a fairly accurate indicator of win or lose each game, unless you’re one of the best players in the game you are going to go up and down like crazy.

**TLDR:** GL that’s how most players get past this (unless you’re chauster or something)

**TLDRTLDR of whole thing** Know if a champion is good against noobs or good against pros. Don’t try to force Shyvana low elo (great you counter jungled them but now you’re entire team is dying in lane because their jungler is ganking them constantly) and don’t try to force Sion at higher elo (people know how to shut him down)

Every champion has their place and you need to think about what you need to do. Early kills/early game win, or play for the long term.

Hope that helped you guys and sorry for any poor grammar or spelling. If you have any questions regarding counters, how to do better, or how to get better feel free to ask me on Reddit (my in-game friend list is mostly full)

I have, in the past, been probably the worst video-game rager I think I've ever heard of. I used to throw tantrums when I couldn't beat the *really* hard challenges in Tony Hawk when I was much younger to the point where I would break things and my family would actually have to talk to me about my raging habits. And by ""raging"", you're about to see some things that make Dyrus, Ocelot, and even Idra look like calm and rational adults.

Anyway, flash-forward to LoL season 1 and my raging was as bad as every - probably worse than even in the past. Sometime near the end of season 1 I decided I would start playing ranked; at the time I was playing a lot of Caitlyn and pretty good at her so I racked up some easy wins and got myself to around 1450 elo. *What happened next is not for the faint of heart and those with weak constitutions/are easily offended might want to stop reading*

Then I started to lose. Big time. The problem was that I wasn't *just* losing but I was starting to get angry while doing so. ""OH MY FUCKING GOD,"" I would say, ""These kids are so FUCKING TERRIBLE. WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY EVEN ALIVE,"" as well as all sorts of rage-like insults, epithets, and vulgar language not suitable for the internet :P Because of this, as I lost games I got angrier, and as I got angrier I found myself *unable* to stop playing. By the end of this 1 day I had lost 11 ranked matches in a row, gone from 1422 elo to ~900, broken several small objects around my computer, and **I actually made my mother cry because of how scarily I was behaving**. The worst part was that, at the time, I wasn't really thinking of the things that I was doing but rather, quite sincerely, wishing the most terrible things to happen to people that I didn't even know just because - I thought - they played poorly at a video game and lowered my score on an imaginary ranking system.

I'm surprised I wasn't banned; and had Riot been able to see how I was acting IRL, they probably would have - and I don't blame them.

While this is quite extreme I will give you some of my thoughts on *why* I behaved that way. When it really came down to it, I think I perceived a failure in LoL as being a blow to my self-worth. Simply put, as ""hardcore"" gamers (i.e. career gaming life of larger than 15k hours, play games every day or at least schedule some time purposely to play video games) we have a very deep emotional investment in our gaming habits. Perhaps this is not on any particular one game, but we do pride ourselves in being ""good"" or ""skilled"" at *games in general*. Unfortunately, this is often the be-all and end-all of gaming: if you do not win you are a failure; **when one invests emotionally in the competitive nature of gaming one experiences a binary euphoric high when they win and a crushing depression when they lose.** This is also true with ""traditional"" sports (see: John Mcenroe).

So what happened next? Well, I basically took a bit of a break from LoL in general and started playing some co-operative or single player games with relatively low skill ceilings where the player is rewarded for communal interaction rather than twitch reflexes or precise play (Dead Island, Psychonauts, Minecraft, etc.); I also made a conscious decision to try and work on my gamer-rage. When I returned to LoL I abandoned ranked in all ways and attempted to just *play for fun, be courteous, and treat every game as a learning experience rather than a ladder grind.* The results? Well, at first there was nothing, but after a few months I actually started to get *better*. This seemed odd, I went from playing 8+ games per day to 1 game every day or 2, and yet I thought, *""shouldn't I be getting worse since I don't practice as much?""* However, since I was now analyzing my mistakes and learning from them I was actually getting better because I was now making each game count. In other words, the quantity of my play time was decreasing but the quality of what I was working on was increasing - and the latter is a much better way to improve skills.

Soon enough, I decided that I wanted to try ranked again, but this time *I didn't care about my ladder ranking, I just wanted games that fit the meta-mold better* (say what you want about that thought); I also decided that I would play *only* my main role of support unless forced to do otherwise (funny enough, it doesn't come up often :P). I found now that in the elo where I was raging and losing before as an AD carry I was carrying an entire team - even *4v5* - as support, something I was told by even 2000k pros was impossible below 1300 elo. So how did I do it? Well, first I played my role to a ""t"": warding right, counter-warding, keeping my carry healthy and farmed, scouting enemy jungler positions. But more so, I was sort of an unofficial ""team captain"", calling out plays to do dragon, invade, push certain lanes, etc. While not everyone would listen to me, those players who wanted to win would see my play call, evaluate them, and if they were good, would follow that plan (they usually were).

Now, I'm sitting at a good 1400 elo and I only play ranked games when I want that extra ""tryhard"" attitude. Beyond that, I am actively involved in things like this subreddit, and organized the Sunday Night Scrim Series where I sometimes play with 1600+ elo people at a level that, I think, is at least somewhat in the ballpark of their skill (at least if I play support :P). I do occasionally rage at video games but those examples are much less than previous and I tend to catch myself before I get out of control. Recently (i.e. today) I played a match though that tested my patience. Essentially, I was playing support Nautilus to my carry Tristana; though this Tristana was relatively skilled with her character there was some miscommunication that resulted in my taking firstblood and Tristana being unable to get a kill because of no co-ordination (essentially, no VOIP). In addition, it was only my second game as Nautilus so I was still getting used to his skillset. Anyway, after this missed kill there was suddenly a barrage of insults from Tristana, ""You're fucking terrible, learn to use your ult"", ""Never play support Naut again"", ""Why the fuck wouldn't you dive if I had heal you fucking idiot"", etc. etc. etc. The funny thing was that we were winning our lane quite easily against an (AP) TF and Soraka (in general, kill lanes like Blitz/Leona/Naut have trouble against a Soraka: if you can't burst the target down fast enough you will be sitting in a bad position while all CD's are blown) so I was a little perplexed. I could have raged and started throwing insults back at him there but I didn't (though, I have to admit, I did throw a passive-aggressive insult where I told him ""I'm sorry I made you sit and tower 1v3 with low health instead of running away""). I just kind of ignored him and asked him ""why are you so mad when you're winning. AND it's in normals"" for the rest of the game we didn't really talk except for the Tristana occasionally insulting me and me actually saying ""gj"" in chat when she got some kills. Unfortunately for her, some great teamfights for me and some good calls kind of made it hard for her to insult me further and by the end of the game we won with a score of [this](http://i.imgur.com/ElkyW.jpg). After the game, I immediately ignored her and reported her for verbal harassment.

Can we use this thread to share tips for our most known champs? for instance:

Playing as rengar, when you hit someone jumping from bush and having your Q activated, if you time it well you can activate the hydra's active at the same time in order to duplicate the dmg.
playing as nidalee, when you throw a spear, you should R and jump back (in order to increse the distance between you and the enemy), this way you will amplify the dmg of the spear.

You can say THAT a lux is a good lux when she lands a good combo (Q/E at the same time, AA to proc pasive, activate E, AA to proc passive again)

As j4 you can use twice the same flag to do the combo! for example, use the combo to jump a wall, use flash to jump another wall, and then use your Q to go back to the first wall! juke every one!

When you play as tryndamere, you can use the aoe of your E to dmg your enemy even when you are running away, you dont need to pass through them

Renek does not need to stop running when he uses his Q, so he can run away or chase someone and hit them with Q, also that animation ""bugs"" the active from hydras, so if you activate hydras WHYLE you press your Q, he will do both dmgs. and dont stop running!

A great way to gank as xin is to use your E not in the enemy champ, but in a minion behind him, then use your ult as fast as posible so you will dmg him with the aoe of your E, slow him and push him back to your partners.

AS voli: The aoe from his slow is higher than the range of his AA... so you can use it to chase someone when you activated your Q

When you ult someone as skarner you can use your Q for dps and stack it!

playing as thresh, if the enemy has a spellshield (morgana, sivir, banshees veil, even when gp eats an orange) you still can use your Q on them, it wont do any dmg and wont supress them, but you can use it to go to them!!

Tristana's ult is NOT single target! it will dmg only one, but if they are near the target it will push back everyone!!!

as thresh, your lamp will take your parner where you are!! not where you were when he clicked on IT, so you can use your second Q or even flash when your partner allready clicked your lamp, and he will end up being with you!

This was originally posted on leaguemeta (whrong!) and i allready had some tips from some people there!:

Oliverious sed:

As singed you can hide your poison! when someone is chasing you, every time you get out of vision (geting into a bush or fog of war) your posion will disapear from theyr vision, but it will still be there and poison them! Also as singed when you flint someone, you can AA your target while the animation of the flint! that will add some nice dps! when playing nocturne, remember to try to remain on the shadow of your Q !! it will give you a really nice ad buf!

laserbastu sed:

As Draven, if you go in to the bottom of the baron pit you won't have to move to catch your axes. Fast barons!

Albaek sed:

A general tip to those with target abilities against enemies with shields. For example, Malphite versus Shen. Malphite's Q is a target ability, and Shen has a shield.

When you use Q on someone outside your range you ""light up"" in a way. You may not always notice it as such, but you become highlighted and people react to this. So, Shen may think ""Oh, he's gonna shard when he comes in range"" and shield up, but the thing is you also highlight if you auto attack him. Now, Malphite is a melee champion, so if you auto attack him outside Q range, then get in Q range they will often shield into nothing. Then after the shield wears off you can throw in a shard.

We're rated unranked, Bronze 2, Bronze 2, Silver 1 and Silver 4 in solo queue if it matters.

EDIT: Seems like 5v5 rating is influenced by ranked solo queue, as people with higher solo ratings in their team get a higher 5v5 rating as well.

* Aatrox is a melee champion who seems to rely on autoattacks to deal most of his damage. Especially the third hit from his blood price ability. To that end, Randuin's Omen and Frozen Heart are going to be awesome at shutting him down. Reducing his attack speed is already going to cut his damage a lot, but even more so when you make that all-important third-hit happen less often. Additionally, he does mostly physical damage, so the armor is going to benefit as well. If it's appropriate to your champion's build paths, consider grabbing a warden's mail early on in lane.

* The champion spotlight makes a big deal of his durability, but that durability seems to come mainly from sustain, not from inherent tankiness. Combined with the way his Blood Well passive works, he's actually a fair target to be burst down early in a fight. If you can kill him before he can charge his blood well, then you'll have a much easier time killing him the second time. Additionally, if you burst him straight up, his op lifesteal/sustain won't matter. Of course, he'll likely build some health to counter this, but it's worth considering.

* Likewise, because of his strong sustain, in lane he'll be dominant against people like Jayce who want to poke someone down before going in for the kill. Against a Riven or Darius, who want to all-in him all the time, his advantages will be less relevant. Again, try to hit him the second he comes (back) into lane, because his blood well won't have anything to heal him with.

* Additionally, look for abilities or items that apply Grievous Wounds. Tristana's Explosive shot, summoner ignite, or Morellonomicon can all shut down his healing. I can't be certain, but I'd imagine that if you can plug him with a grievous wounds debuff before his blood well activates, you can cut the amount of health he revives with in half.

* And lastly, the exact same way you counter anything else (And that I add only because someone's got to say it, even though it's a cop-out), if you CC him, he can't do things. Although again, given that his sustain is dependent on doing things, it's actually slightly more relevant here.",Aatrox,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,aatrox,default,True,t3_1g6h4h,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1g6h4h/options_for_countering_aatrox/,

I know how to play him during the laning phase. Although I absolutely do not know how to teamfight as Kha'Zix or any assassin to that. Previously I've only played adc/support and I'm trying to learn more roles so I decided to play Kha'Zix since he seems so fun.

I know that prior to a teamfight I'm supposed to dish out ash much damage as I can to targets with my W. Although once the fight starts I have absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to do. I know I'm supposed to kill squishy targets and use resets on my leap to escape or continue the fight. Although every time I try I get blown up or fail to kill the squishy targets quickly enough(I may get them to about 1/3 health but I can't finish the job).

My build on him was roughly(this roughly the items I have when I get blown up in teamfights. This is not a finished build):

Muramana/Manamune, Mercury Treads, Black Cleaver, BT, Giants belt(should I upgrade to warmogs earlier?).

Do I need to build more defensive items? Also now that I think about it I was always within leap range of an ADC during the teamfight so I do recall using leap to jump straight onto the ADC. Should I be using my ult to just walk past everyone to the back lines?

**Overall I'd just love some tips on how to play him.** Maybe some mechanics that'll help my laning phase. But I'd just prefer someone teaching me how to teamfight as Kha.

Also what's your opinion on your 3rd evolution? Should I evolve his ULT or Q? I know his Q would be helpful in killing squishy targets. I'm not too familiar with his ULT so I haven't been evolving it much but recently I feel like I'm getting the hang of it and have used it in 1v1 situations to come out on top.

Thanks a ton if you've read up to here, I'm sorry for the long thread :c

**tl;dr** how do I teamfight with Kha'Zix

Edit: Also just a quick question when do I build hexdrinker? As I said before I've only played ADC/Support so I haven't come across the item before. Thanks

This time I'll be writing about **""Splitpushing""** it's effects towards the Victory of your game, the impact it makes to the enemy team, when or when not to splitpush, and what champions can splitpush, etc. 

Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy the guide and offer some feedback to everyone else and I if I were to get something wrong or wasn't clear enough, etc. As always, you're all welcome to comment on this guide if I missed anything and add that it, or if you'd like for me to write about something else for the next ""Tips for Success"" you can PM me here on Reddit. Thanks ahead guys

**Splitpushing Fundamentals**

**What is Splitpushing?**

Splitpushing is the act of having a champion go ""push"" another lane down, e.g. Taking a tower in Top Lane when your team and the enemy team are ""poking"" at Bot Lane, while the rest of his/her team is off completing other objectives, i.e. Dragon, Baron, buffs, teamfighting, etc. 

 * This is generally done after the ""laning"" phase in which teams are usually grouping up for objectives or teamfights.

**The effects of Splitpushing**

**Benefits for your team**

 * May give your team a turret advantage, thusly ""pushing"" that lane and (sometimes) forcing the enemy team to ""back off"" from fighting you 5v5 or 5v4 due to Creeps invading their base or potentially taking out another tower in that lane. 

 * This ^ opens up opportunities for your team to ""take"" other objectives w/o much contesting from the enemy team. 

 * Since you may get a tower out of splitpushing, this may give a Gold advantage to your team, i.e. 750 total Gold for the team

 * May force the enemy team to send one of their teammates to go ""deal"" with you making it a 4v4 for your team, which may (depending on team composition, your splitpushing champion, etc.) give your team an advantage. 

**When to Splitpush**

Although very situational, you may decide to splitpush if you meet at least one of these criteria:

 * Your team and the enemy team are just ""hovering"" and not doing anything except ""exchanging"" waves of CS, you may go and splitpush another lane. e.g. The enemy team puts the Mid Lane tower ""under siege"" and your team, to prevent the enemy from taking it, take out the CS waves that come up to it.

 * Your team is pushing another lane and the enemy team is coming to ""intercept"" them, AND you know that the enemy team will not win the ""engagement,"" you may splitpush a separate lane.

 * If you and your team have ""killed off"" the usual enemy laner that would be sent to ""stop"" your splitpushing (generally their Top Lane, sometimes), you may go splitpush

 * If you're playing a champion that is able to get into teamfights really quickly, after splitpushing, due to SS Teleport, Shen ult, Boots of Mobility, etc., or are able to contribute to teamfights w/o having to be in the fight itself, e.g. Gangplank ult, Karthus ult, etc.

 * If you're playing a champion that is excessively ""slippery"" due to his/her kit, e.g. Nidalee, Shen, Katarina, etc.

 * Are playing a champion that is able to clear CS waves extremely quickly, e.g. Twisted Fate, Nidalee, etc.

**How to Splitpush** 

If you meet some of the criteria above then you essentially:

 * Clear CS waves with you AAs and kit as quickly as possible to ""push"" the lane and potentially take a tower.

 * Be sure to be **very** map aware, in case of 1+ man ganks.

 * Know when to ""back off"" e.g. You ""spidey-sense"" that you're gonna die if you take the next CS wave, enemy is MIA, etc.

 * Know your DMG Splitpushing potential, i.e. how quickly you can get the job done, faster with items like Sheen, Sunfire Cape, Lich Bane, etc.

1361471157.0,30,self.summonerschool,18yttl,Lane Advantage &amp; How to Make Use of it (Lengthy read),PSL8,39,9,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18yttl/lane_advantage_how_to_make_use_of_it_lengthy_read/,"Hi /r/summonerschool, I'd like to do a little instructional post on how to take advantage of (any) lane and what to do when you are ahead. I am a Plat 3 NA player, so I'm not the best but I figure with so many posts containing the same complaints (""I always end up 11-0 in lane but team feeds GG""), I could help out fellow summoners by explaining what to do in such a situation. I was a Bronze player in Season 1, Silver Season 2, and Plat this season with an attainable goal of Diamond by the end of it. 

I have included little TL;DRs at the bottom of each section for those who want to skim.
 


&gt;**Situation 1: You get First Blood against your lane opponent, what should you do?**

* First of all, congrats on First Blood. It feels good, doesn't it? I'm going to use top lane for this scenario. Lets say you get first blood at level 2 in top lane with an all-in from both players, i.e. all summoners are blown and you are 1 level ahead of your lane opponent. Most players  in this situation would think that the lane is effectively over (in your favor); HOWEVER, you should take into consideration the following:

1. Both summoners are down
2. The enemy jungler is going to gank
3. Your ward at level 1 (which I assume you bought) has expired
4. First blood is 400 gold, the equivalent of boots of speed, longsword, cloth armor, etc. While this is indeed a big advantage in early game, it is not indicative of your lane being won.

* Remember that death timers are very short in the early levels. If your minion wave is not pushed hard enough, your lane opponent *should* be able to return in time to recoup most of the experience lost under tower. This translates to roughly ~half a level.

* What should your first buy be? WARD. Any other item is completely up to you, but ALWAYS buy a ward. The safe assumption to make in this situation is that the enemy jungler is aware of this knowledge and will look to gank top in an effort to help his laner get back into the game. Always keep river and/or tribrush warded in the top lane. 

* Should you play aggressive or passively farm up your advantage? Keep in mind, that while you do have the 1 kill advantage, there is always the chance of you misplaying your lane and giving the kill right back. I have seen it far too many times in lower elo games as well as high elo games where first blood advantage is completely thrown away. While it is a good idea to go aggressive and zone after establishing an early lead, you must take into consideration the enemy champion and his/her abilities to trade. Some champions are better than others in the early game and have the ability to kill the other even if they are a level behind. Champions like Xin Zhao and Udyr have AMAZING level 2 burst damage and will almost always be able to out-trade you. Most of the time it comes down to ward coverage and map awareness. Knowing where the enemy jungler is and capitalizing on it by going aggressive on your lane opponent.

* TL;DR - FB Advantage is nice, but does not 100% determine your lane. Play safe and WARD. Always, ALWAYS keep your river warded. If you are playing a weaker early game hero, passively farm up to further increase your lead. Don't get too cocky. If you attempt another all-in, there is always a chance of you losing the trade because you decided to tank a full minion wave's worth of damage or take a free tower hit. Play SMART.

&gt;**Situation 2 (The one that really matters): ""I'm 6-0 in lane but my team is feeding GG can't win, I don't know what to do!""**

* Annoying, isn't it? Knowing you completely dominated your lane but your bot lane is 1-5 or your top lane has died 3 times in a row and the enemy Teemo is getting fed. In Bronze (especially), Silver (especially), Gold (especially), and sometimes Plat (unfortunately) games, the fed player will start cussing their teammate out, further demoralizing them and making them feel worse about their mistakes. Sometimes, it really isn't your teammates' fault they got outplayed or got countered in lane. Shit happens, and YOU can make it better. Here's how!

* Keep a **positive** attitude. I cannot stress this enough. I have been in both positions. When I am the one getting outplayed in lane and going 0-3 in the first 10 minutes, I feel crappy. I know I let my team down. What I don't need is for everyone to make it worse. I will try my best to farm up and hopefully make an impression in teamfights. Here's an example of a game I played in my Gold I to Plat V promotion series. I played Zed top and went 0-3 in lane in 15 minutes. I fucked up my level 2 all-in and the enemy (rightfully) took advantage of my mistake and continued to snowball against me. Our jungler started spamming in chat, ""gg silver (due to my border) noob feed"" with the rest of my teammates following suit. This made me feel like shit, but I told them that I would try my best to farm and do my job in teamfights, which is to assassinate their ADC. Lo and behold, when teamfights started, I was able to 1 shot their ADC because I tried my best to farm up. I ended up beating my opponent in lane in CS score. We won teamfight after teamfight, with me complimenting my teammates' good play. Saying things like ""nice ult"" or ""good stun"" at the end of a fight is what all players should do. I kept telling my team that we would win this game. Guess what? We won and I ended up with a much better score than their top laner. Our jungler ended up apologizing for his early behaviour, stating that he had a bad day and he should never have cussed me out before the game was officially over. **TL;DR - Stay positive, even when you lose your lane. When your teammates are the ones losing their lane, encourage them to farm up and play safe. Don't add to the shit that they are already dealing with.**

&gt;**Alright, lets dive right into it. You have established a significant advantage in your lane, you are now up a few kills as well as CS. Your bot lane is failing. What should you do? (I'm going to use mid lane for this example)**

1. Ward up. Keep both sides of the river warded. Good ward spots for mid lane are the enemy wraiths and the ""banana"" brush near the blue golem camp (the one closest to lane). 

2. ROAM. You have a huge advantage over your lane opponent and he/she is no longer worth much gold, why would you stay in lane and NOT roam? There are a few things to remember when you are looking to roam. These are important. **Always** push out your lane before you commit to roaming. This result is that your minions will end up at their tower, forcing either the enemy jungler or mid laner to defend it or they will lose gold and experience. **Ask** your bot lane where the wards are. If it is heavily warded and the enemy team is not extended, don't go bot UNLESS you are planning a full dive with your jungler. Look to roam top, instead. **IF** you want to gank bot and you are at base, look to gank through LANE. Chances are, the enemy team won't expect a lane gank from the the mid laner. 

3. ROAM Pt. 2 - When you roam, make sure your bot lane is aware that you are coming. Spam pings, chat, do whatever you need to in order to let them know. Once you are there and the action is starting, give the kills to your AD carry IF POSSIBLE. You are already 6-0 (or whatever), it is actually better if your AD got the gold. If you get a kill or two, look towards global objectives if you and your teammates are healthy enough. Dragon or bot tower, both are good. 

4. Taking down mid tower. When ganking bot is not feasible and assuming you still have a big lead over your lane opponent, it is also a good idea to push down mid tower (after warding). Mid tier 1 tower is the most important one in the game and taking it down gives your team a significant advantage in terms of map control. 

5. **Keep ganking bot**. It is a good idea to maintain the pressure that you are giving. Keep up the strong map presence. Consecutive ganks that are successful will not only help your bot lane catch up, but will also lessen the pressure on your ADC from losing early. 

6. Counterganks. If you plan on going bot again, tell your jungler to come as well. Chances are, the enemy jungler will be prepared for this and will be there as well. Try to think about potential outcomes. Can you win a 4v4? If yes, go for it. If not, tell your team to back off and you should continue to push mid tower to draw the jungler away from counterganking bot. 

7. **Teamfights**! You are at the teamfighting phase of the game, where dragons are contested over and towers are being sieged. What should you do? It is important to remember NOT to play too cocky and initiate as the mid laner. The enemy team KNOWS you are fed and will most likely focus you down. Let your tank do the initiating and make sure to lay down as much damage as you can before they burst you down. Don't be too cocky just because you are 6-0 from laning phase.

TL;DR - Ward, ward, ward. Stay positive. Help out your weaker lanes instead of cussing them out. Make an impact in the game. Mid lane and jungle have the **potential** to influence the game the most. Its up to the players to decide whether or not they want to or not. Play safe.


Apologies for the wall of text but I hope I helped clear some things up. Moral of the story - always buy wards and help out the other lanes. And most importantly, keep a positive attitude and encourage your teammates. Give them help when they aren't playing great and compliment them when they do play well. Cheers!

""ADC player here. Been playing for a few years. Have had a handful of accounts here and there. There are some definite tips that I feel like people playing ADC need to know that will improve their general gameplay mechanics as ADC.

First let me start by saying this: ADC is high risk - high reward. There is no other feeling like getting a quadra or penta in a team fight. At the same time, a lot of the team will generally look to you if a team fight completely collapses. Let me clarify, nobody in their right mind should want to play ADC unless you genuinely enjoy playing ranged DPS characters. You are squishy as shit, you will be CC helled in team fights, you will be first priority target to kill late game, and you will be the focus of attention laning phase if you start to get too big. ADC is hard as shit to pull off successfully - don't let the guys like Doublelift or ChaoX distort the reality of the lane.

1) In early laning phase, it is not that smart to put down tons of harass. Why? Because it not only causes creep aggro, it focuses the lane attention of the creeps to YOU rather than the opposite creeps. What happens? The lane naturally pushes forward. So now you're thinking, oh well I have wards and the jungler won't get me. Think again. Not only can a strong jungler like Maokai, Nocturne, or Shen still get to you - if you push the lane against an ADC like me, I will keep it in front of my turret ALL DAY. You instantly get a disadvantage by pushing the lane as you are more susceptible to lane ganks. Use your harass wisely. I generally do NOT harass until I get my first set of items which include my tier 2 boots. Now this is not always an accepted fact - there are moments when you CAN harass early game and get away with it although you need to weigh the pros and cons of every situation game by game. If the enemy jungler is getting shit on by your team, it might be a good idea to push your lane.

2) RELAX RELAX RELAX. I see a lot of ADC freak out when they miss a few CS. ITS OK. BREATHE. You are NOT doublelift and you will not perform up to his CS standards. All people who play ADC have an advantage they naturally bring to the characters. Doublelift is CS god - he hardly misses CS, but he has historically had really shitty positioning. ChaoX, while not as good at CSing, has godlike positioning. They are both great players. Do not freak out when you miss a few minions in a row as it will snowball down a shitty path.

3) The best thing to do when attempting to CS is predict when a minion will be LOW ENOUGH to CS. Let me explain more clearly: when I see a minion is about to die I naturally start a quick timer in my head that will go down to 0. At 0, my own creeps will kill him. When I start that time I tunnel vision out and get the overall picture of the lane - where is my opponent, what is the next minion I will hit, is the jungler coming, where is my support, how is my mana, etc. While doing this I naturally get the minion just in time because I have my mind timer down to know exactly when to CS. A lot of enemy ADC I play against just simply take harass when they are CS'ing because they focus on one minion at a time. Learn to CS while getting having awareness of the entire lane. This takes an incredible amount of time but it is well worth it to learn how to be map aware while CSing.

4) Never ever ever never ever rely on your support to do anything for you. You must learn to play the role of ADC as if it is 2v1. If you rely on solo que supports you will fail. This is just how the game works, unfortunately. Nobody really takes support role serious so you will all too often be left expecting your support to exhaust, stun, flash, pull, stasis, chase, ward, etc with no result. Learn to play independently and wisely. Pick and choose your battles. I am not putting down support as I believe it is a very important role for the team as a whole - I am simply saying if you are playing with a support that is not on skype with you and you do not have a general bot lane relationship, learn to play bot lane more conservatively.

5) Edit your keyboard configuration to your liking. You do not need to use the default config, and if anything, the default config leaves you with a HUGE disadvantage.

6) This point coincides with 5 a little bit. Attack moving is a required mechanical skill if you plan on advancing over your current hurdle. You must learn to use your keyboard to your advantage on this. Simply using your mouse to click on the enemy char, click away, click back, click away, WILL FAIL. You might have some success but in the long run this mechanic is inefficient as it is prone to misclicking. I personally switch my A button (attack move) to my space bar as I believe my thumb is generally unused in my gameplay. This way I don't have to sacrifice my normal hand positioning that I am so accustomed to using. Using this keyboard config, I can use my space bar and right click to get away and auto attack the nearest champion chasing me. I cannot tell you how many people I have kited or straight up killed using this mechanic. It becomes easier as you get a phantom dancer as it allows you great mobility.

7) Understand the ROLE of ADC is simply DPS. Straight - raw - damage. When you play in the upper levels, you will almost never get a chance to simply catch the opposite ADC in front of you. You will almost always have to lay damage out on their tanks and bruisers. Is this a bad thing? Hell fuck no its not. As long as you are attacking SOMETHING it is better than not attacking at all. Will I go in after a Vayne if I see Mundo charging at me? Nope. Mundo is going to die or get chunked. When he leaves the fight, I move forward. A general rule of thumb is to never attack the enemy support UNLESS he has an early oracles. In this instance, I will rush after him.

8) Positioning is K E Y. Get into position BEFORE initiating your fights. Are you somewhat in the front line? Take a second or two to get in the back before starting to initiate. Do not go ballsack YOLO 420 swag and dps whatever is in front of you without realizing your position. Get in the back then lay down the pain. Almost all of your deaths will happen because you are out of position and easy to get to.

9) Do NOT worry about burning flash too early. Better to burn it too early then to get exhausted and die. This principle also applies to HEAL especially if the enemy has an ignite. As ADC you are not afforded extra seconds of life tanky champs are. Use your summoners generously but wisely. Ezreal about to ult your face off? Flash is ok. Soraka about to banana you? Flash not ok. I see a lot of people save their flashes for the very very last second and it is not wise as an exhaust will almost always counter a flash if you have bad positioning. Finding that grey area of when it is useful to flash and when it is not comes from experience. You will learn how to use it effectively.

10) If you have a champion with quick escape mechanisms, you generally want to use them as an escape, not an initiate. I see a lot of Ezreals start a team fight with their arcane shift - bad idea unless you are 100% you will win the team fight. Same idea with Graves, save your quick shift to help get away unless you are certain you will win the exchange.

11) You can buy wards TOO you know! Do not rely on your support to place proper wards. I cannot stress how many times I have played against a Blitzcrank and my support never wards the lane brush. As ADC you might need vision on certain areas that your support does not know about or cannot do in time. I have gotten a ton of kills by warding a brush of a champion I am chasing to get that final shot in. Always carry at least 1 ward when you return to lane - it will help the overall team and could secure you a kill.

These are just some tips. I hope they have been useful to you guys. Please feel free to add more! I also hope to hear from other ADC players on their advice. GOOD LUCK!""

I just wanted to share something I have been working on and how it has improve my gameplay tremendously in the an extremely short time.  Just a little back story on how and why I created what I did.  I originally created an excel spreadsheet to keep track of all the champions, prices, whether I owned them and whether I wanted to buy them.  I did this since whenever I had enough IP, I usually made a spur of the moment decision and bought a champion that I regretted later on.  By keeping track of which champions I owned and which ones I've had my eye on for a while, this led to smarter purchases with my IP.  This allowed me to see a simple view of all the champions I owned and how much I needed to buy the ones I wanted.

Fast forward a couple months and I think to myself that I should start adding on to my spreadsheet and start tracking my games.  I then stumble upon this post [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/uel9r/excel_game_tracking_sheet_version_2/).  The spreadsheet that ebilgenius created was EXACTLY what I wanted to start tracking so I decided to try it out, but the version that was linked in that post was somehow broken.  I decided to fix up the parts that I wanted and implemented it into mine (after asking him for permission of course).  After keeping track of my games, I started to notice that I've been winning... A LOT!  Just writing down a small comment after each game on how I could improve has made a huge difference.  I try to stay clear of leaving comments like ""top fed"" and try to write down stuff like ""top got fed, try ganking top more to help"".  Just the act of writing these small comments down helps keep them in my mind when I play my next game and have noticed a significant improvement in my play (just look at my games starting 7/20/2012 as proof).  

I've left a link to the spreadsheet that I created.  I'll give a quick rundown on how to use it if you are willing to try.

1. If a new champion comes out, go to the ""Champs"" tab and fill in their information at the bottom (the spreadsheet will do the rest of the fancy stuff).
1. After playing a game, go to the ""Main"" tab and click the ""Add Game"" button.
1. After clicking the button, a popup box will appear.  Complete all the fields (for ELO, you can just put 0 since there isn't any way to track normal ELO anymore) as accurately as you can.
1. Try to put something constructive in the ""Things to Improve"" box on how **YOU** can improve, rather than blaming teammates.
1. Hit the ""Save"" button (the ""Save"" button in the form, not the document).
1. The data will be added to the spreadsheet and will be color coded whether you won or lost.
1. A quick summary of your stats will be displayed on the right side of the ""Main"" tab showing your stats for various roles and lanes you have played.
1. For a more detailed summary, click the ""Summary"" button for a pivot table of the information.

**Note** I have a couple ""placeholder"" games in my ""Main"" tab in order to get rid of some errors.  You can choose to create placeholder games or simply delete them, but if you do not have a match with every lane and role played, some of the calculations will show an error (but if you do use the placeholder games, then the ""Overall Win Ratio"" will be lower).

**Note 2** You must enable macros to use my spreadsheet (don't worry, I didn't put in anything to harm your computer).

Feel free to ask me any questions/comments or if you want me to add any features to the spreadsheet if you are planning to use it.  I already have a couple ideas on what to add to it, but don't have the time right now to put them in (mostly adding graphs to show stats on champs, roles, lanes and how much you are improving based off of wins/time).

Get the spreadsheet [HERE](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bygenmvm7j4LaHdZVWF1U3JOUVk) (EDITED: uploaded a blank spreadsheet with placeholders instead of uploading my personal one with my stats)

**EDIT** [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/a28sl.png) is a screenshot to show how much I've improved in such a short amount of time. 

**EDIT 2** I created this using Excel 2010.  For those of you using a previous version of Excel, it may not work.  I highly suggest trying elolog.net instead.

Here's a list in order of what  commonly inhibit players from reaching the level of play they're looking for.

1) Knowing you have a weakness

The first step to getting better at any game is knowing that there are things to be improved, so by simply being here, congrats. You've completed step one. People who don't know they need help won't look for it and won't see flaws in their play. This is very hard to overcome and many people struggle with it. You may not know what's wrong with your play or how to remedy it yet, but that's okay.

2) Experience

Okay so you have 150 wins under your belt, you've been playing about 2 or 3 months. You hit level 30 about 2 weeks ago and feel you're ready for ranked. First game: you go 0-9, your entire team flames you and you dont know why. That's because those guys have probably played about twice as long as you have.

So sometimes, it's just the simple fact that you havent played the game enough. Keep playing. If you haven't even hit level 30 yet, of course you're gonna have flaws in your play. Actually, if you're reading guides like this, your already ahead of the curve. After around 250  wins, its safe to say you have a good amount of experience and game knowledge. You'll still have stuff to learn but you'll know a lot.

3) Arrogance

This is the sole reason ""Elo Hell"" (if there is one) exists. There are a bunch of players who think they play on a pro level but are only being held back by their teammates. This kind of feeds back into step 1 but its kind of a different monster. These guys believe they're the next chaox and are quicker to believe that everyone around him is terrible (both teammates and opponents) and that's the only thing holding him back.

If you're stuck at 800 Elo (or any elo for that matter), THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR PLAY, NOT THEIRS! Any pro can easily carry a team from any position by just using basic mechanics of their play at this Elo. Maybe it's the decisions you make, maybe you have a problem last hitting, maybe you don't go for objectives enough, maybe you just dont communicate with your team well enough. But somewhere in there, there's some kind of mechanical or logical failure in your play. Look over your play carefully to see if there's something that can be improved for next time or have a more experienced friend look it over with you.

4) Attitude

This ones simple. Sometimes people don't approach the game with the right state of mind and it causes their play to suffer. It's either "" I'm so bad at this game. I'll never get better. What's the point of playing anymore?"" or ""I'm so f*cking pissed off! Why did those noobs feed last game! I hate noobs"" or "" i had such a bad day... I'm so frustrated. Lemme play a game or two of league. I'll feel better after i win""

None of these are right. The goal of the game is to have fun right? So when you log on, make you're in a good mood or at least neutral and relaxed. If you're trying to improve, you can analyze things better because you won't have your emotions clouding your vision. 50% of the battle is before the game even starts, make sure your ready.

5) Stagnation

The advancement in your play can start to stall if you stop experimenting and trying new things. Try a new role, try a new champion you've always been curious about, try a new playstyle altogether, try something you've never seen before or something no one else has thought of. Being able to think outside of the box and find something that suits you best can take a great leap to improve your play. This game is full of possibilities, never stop experimenting.

6) Specialization

No one's good at everything. Even the pros. They have one or two roles they're really good at with a variety of champions to fill them and everything else they play decent enough to not hurt the team overall. But getting that 1 or 2 roles down to the best of your abilities is what will allow you to reach one of the highest plateaus in the game.

7)Striving for perfection

This is what separates the good players from the pros. Being able to comb out every little kink in your play so that mistakes are rare or just don't happen altogether. Honestly, this is the hardest part seeing that no one will ever be perfect at this game. You've been motivated this entire time learning everything there is about this game so don't stop now. Keep pushing yourself.

I apologize for the length and yeah it's a bit sappy at times but i hope people can absorb these points to help themselves improve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Feel free to disagree with anything i've said here. I am by no means a pro and i dont think i know everything there is about this game. I'm actually in the learning process of playing starcraft 2 at a level i feel that i can play this game on. I need to follow a couple of these progressing through both league and SC 2 as well.

But I digress. Thanks for reading and good luck to everyone looking to improve. PM me or comment if you have questions.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_uwjoq,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/uwjoq/not_getting_any_better_read_this/,

I'll link the piece (which has a few pictures and a warding map) and try to c/p it here without slaughtering the formatting.

**League of Legends Noob Academy: Why Mages Go Mid**

&gt;For many of us the more primitive and base knowledge on how League of Legends operates is common sense, or simply something we've known for so long that we've forgotten that such ideas aren't, in fact, self-evident. Today we start a series aimed at newer players, to give them some background and explanation about why things are the way they are in League of Legends. We start with the middle lane, and why mages love it so!

It occurred to me as I gently berated my friend the other night that not all players understand why certain things are the way they are in the League of Legends world.  After over an hour of discussion and explanation about why each archetype goes in which lane and how it is the most efficient way to play it dawned me that many players simply take lane set-ups and metagame-inspired strategies for granted.  So today we’ll be sharing the first of many “Noob Academy” articles with the intent of educating newer players about the macro strategy of League of Legends.

Before we begin, let me clarify the usage of the term “noob.”  Being a noob isn’t a bad thing, and calling someone a noob isn’t really an insult either.  When I call this article “Noob Academy” it isn’t to look down at new players or incite any rage, contrary, it is simply to address those whom I hope to edify.  We all start off as noobs and we all learn at different paces while garnering different attitudes towards learning.  Furthermore this piece isn’t necessarily aimed at brand new players, as my friend has played hundreds of games of League and still didn’t understand these finer, somewhat obscure points.  Fresh players should simply focus on playing the game and learning how things work, advanced tactics and stratagems have no place there.  No, this is for those of you who have ever wondered “why can’t the AD carry go mid, and why does top have to be a bruiser?” and didn’t have anyone to answer your questions.

On to the topic then!  Why do mages go to middle lane?

**The Benefits and Shortcomings of Middle Lane**

The first thing to examine when considering why any archetype should go where is the benefits of going to said lane, as well as its shortcomings.  The most obvious reason to go to the middle lane is for solo lane experience.  Back in the day before jungling became proliferate the middle lane was the only one that had a single champion in it, and thus its solo experience was a coveted possession indeed.  Nowadays there are two lanes that grant solo experience (generally speaking) yet this is still the biggest boon to the lane along with positioning.  Any champion in middle lane has easy access to multiple jungle entrances but also the global objectives of Baron and Dragon, not to mention being equidistant from both top and bottom lane.  Also mid lane is the closest lane to the fountain, thus making return trips and hiking back doesn’t take quite as long as in the other lanes!  Lastly the distance from the middle of the lane to one’s own tower is sufficiently shorter than the comparable distance in other lanes, making escaping ganks a somewhat easier affair.

Obviously though there are some disadvantages to going mid lane as well.  While it supplies wonderful access to a plethora of locations and objectives it is also the lane which is most susceptible to ganks.  In total there are six causeways enemies and allies can use to enter the lane from the river area not to mention the back two entrances behind the tier one tower, and of course jumping over the wall from wraiths as well!  Likewise middle lane provides no in-lane brush for juking or line of sight shenanigans, so champions who fight in middle lane need to be proficiently survivable on their own merits.  Due to all of these access points defensively warding for oneself in mid lane is a more difficult affair than in other lanes.  While two wards can grant sufficient river vision on both ends to be relatively safe, it is still imperfect compared to even one ward in the other lanes.

**Why Mages Fit In Middle Lane Perfectly**

First and foremost mages, more than any other class in the game, benefit the most from gaining levels.  Compared to carries and bruisers, who value gold more so than levels, a mage with no items and level six is a terror into him or herself.  Most mages become killing machines when they ding level six (many before that even) and the only way to deal with a mage and their burst power in said lane is to, funny enough, throw the same thing back at them!  Sure enough there are some defense-oriented champions who can flourish in mid lane (such as Galio and Ryze) and a few extremely powerful early game champions (such as Pantheon and Talon) but the general rule-of-thumb is to put a mage mid who can outplay the enemy mage and snowball the early and midgame a bit in your team’s favor.

Branching from their desire for and power from levels mages can use the positional advantage mid lane grants them to project power across the rest of the map.  Coordinating a buff steal or skirmish with one’s jungle is an easy affair given the copious amounts of entrances the mid lane grants to both jungles.  Likewise mages grant both teams a powerful asset in Dragon fights compared to any other archetype that would take over the lane, and a mage with blue buff or powerful area of effect abilities can often turn the tide of a fight in the confined environs of the jungle and Dragon areas.  Beyond even these things though a well-played mage can simply walk up or down the river and gank either lane to great success considering most have either extreme mobility, burst potential, or both.  

On the other hand mages have a multitude of tools to cope with mid lane’s shortcomings.  While it is an extremely disadvantageous location for escaping ganks many mages have the crowd control or mobility to juke out of a gank or escape back to the turret safely.  Many classes don’t have the raw mobility to address this problem and considering how easy it is to camp mid lane, with its multiple entrances, brushes, and possible warding locations, mages fit the bill quite nicely.  

**What About The Old “Ranged Carry Mid” Strategy?**

This old playstyle grew out of a desire to give carry players the most gold as possible because, even back in the game’s infancy, players realized a duo lane pushed the carry’s farm back too long to be remotely useful during the middle spans of the match.  One must understand though that this tactic was encourage more by the fact that, most of the time, mid lane was the only solo lane, not because ranged carries are well suited for the shenanigans that go on in the mid lane.  Most carries don’t have extreme mobility or burst and lack sufficient power to duel in the beginning stages of the game, and a few well-coordinated ganks set them back much further than any other archetype.  A carry lives and dies by their gold gain, hence this old tactic.

There were a few  problems with this though!  If one thinks “just put them top solo when junglers started becoming  a mainstay of play” then think again, because if it was a 2v1 lane they’d get rolled, and if it was a 1v1 odds are that it was a bad match-up for the carry more often than not.  Funny enough the “0cs support” hasn’t been around forever and was started by the Europeans, so bottom lane wasn’t terribly attractive until the playerbase started taking the 0cs support idea seriously and eventually take it for granted that it will be done in every game.  Compound all of these factors with the reality that mages started going middle (largely in response to carries being mid, and the fact that mages absolutely wreck carries in lane) and it will be profusely evident that the era of “carries mid” is over for a good reason.

*Now, there are a few instances where sending specific carries mid as a counter pick are viable, but don't worry about that for now.*

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day the mage and middle lane fit together like a hand and its glove.  With careful play and a bit of knowledge any clever player can take a mobile mage mid and hold their own with the best of them, even with jungle pressure  and a lack of wards.  The benefits of the lane not only grant players access to their high-level spells as quickly as possible but also a rewarding dueling experience that grants immense satisfaction if won.  Perhaps over the next few years as League of Legends grows and adapts to the professional scene the champions present in mid lane will change, but for the time being the center of Summoner’s Rift is undoubtedly the territory of mages and assassins alike.

I'm low ELO.  Currently sitting around 950.  However, I was a lot lower, and have been doing tremendously well lately (I haven't had a negative game in three weeks).  I have a feeling (not guaranteed but this is what it seems like) I'll be probably up around 1100+ at some point in the next few weeks.

So here's what I did to get better:

**Play support.**

When you play support, you gain a far greater understanding of the game in general.  Your map awareness skyrockets, you start counting timers, buying wards, etc.  Luckily, these habits aren't something that just switches off if you play a game as AD or mid or jungler.

I played solely support for a period of about two weeks.  Over the course of this time, I feel like I learned more about the game than the rest of my time playing combined.  I recently switched back to maining AP mid (mostly Lux and Sion), and all of the habits from my stint as a support have stuck with me.  You learn to control the lane better, when ganks are probably coming, your map awareness is far better... I'm actually amazed at my own progress (not to sound arrogant, sorry.  Like I said, I'm still in triple digit ELO).  You also find yourself finding ways to cover for your teammates mistakes, again because of playing support.

Also, it can help you see your own mistakes in other people.  For example, I always played aggressively as an AD, and it got me killed a lot.  During my support stint, I started to notice people doing similar things and started doing things like telling them my heal CDs so that they knew when they could run in and such.

So, all in all, this is just pretty much saying everything everyone else says you need to get better at, just condensing it and giving you a way to practice it.  So if decide to take my advice, go out, pick up Soraka, play her in a bunch of normals (or solo queue if you want).

And I don't know if this would even go for everyone, but it worked for me.  So I'm just trying to help.  If you have any suggestions or criticisms of anything that said, tell me!

So, because of his huge fame in the LCS and OGN, I picked up Varus last week and started playing him. I looooove him, but I want to make sure I'm doing it right.

I have a few questions I would love to have answered...

What do you think of my:

* Runes: [LS-AD-ARM-MR](http://imgur.com/tbpM41T)
* Masteries: [21/0/9](http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#ZMUMSGvTvdPZyUr) or [18/0/12](http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#3MUMSGvqdPZ1tr) depending on if I want the extra lifesteal
* I basically always start with Doran's Blade
* I rush Blade of the Ruined King like....99% of the time
* My typical build path is Cutlass --&gt; Boots 1 --&gt; BorK --&gt; Boots 2 --&gt; IE | from there I build what is needed, between Bloodthirster, Last Whisperer, etc
* I max R&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;W

Should some of this be different?

I also have questions about how to maximize my damage.

* I understand my W gives better damage on my spell casts, but sometimes I'm not sure how much to wait. If I should be trying to get all 3 autos in before I cast a spell...or not worry about it...?

* Does my Q do more damage based on *chargeup time* or *range*? Basically, is it like a Nid spear? If I am face-to-face with someone, but I have the time, should I fully charge my Q before hitting them? Or can I just quick-fire it for the same damage? (we're talking melee-range ish)

* Let's say I have a Thresh as support. He lands a good hook on their ADC, and I want to lay out some damage. How many auto's do you go for, before casting spells? Do you try to get all 3, then E, then Q? Do you auto, E, auto, Q?

* What about in Teamfights? How concerned should I be with getting W procs? Should I make it a high priority?

* Let's say I'm split pushing, and I catch someone for 1v1. Should I Ult-auto-e-auto-q-auto? Or Ult-auto-auto-auto-E-Q?

I have a few replays of him, but I'll be honest: Every one of my games has either been me absolutely crushing, going something like 6/1/10, or my team getting completely crushed, with me at 1/10/2, usually because of disconnects. If you still want to review a replay or two, please let me know what type of game (I really don't have any games that were 'close') and I'll be more than happy to provide!

At the level I am at, almost nobody last hits, in any lane. They just autoattack a minion until it's dead, and move on to the next one.

I've been practicing last hitting a lot, and have been getting much better. However, the issue I have is that I get pushed easily, because they are AAing aggressively.

How does one respond to this? I realize that them being over extended means an easy gank, but it isn't always guaranteed that we have a jungler, much less a reliable one. Should I AA just as much, and distribute the damage so I don't miss last hits? Should I let it happen and call for mid to gank? What's the appropriate reaction?

1366777362.0,29,self.summonerschool,1czn1p,Is it safe to say I'm never leaving bronze?,theappleiwarlock,38,9,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1czn1p/is_it_safe_to_say_im_never_leaving_bronze/,"I'm probably writing this post mainly out of anger/frustration, but I feel I need to rant a little and I feel this community might be the only people that understand where I'm coming from. So brace yourselves for a wall of text and feel free to leave comments (hopefully of encouragement) or opinions. I will not say that I am some amazing player that needs to be in challenger. I just don't think I deserve bronze.

S2 I probably jumped in ranked too soon after I hit 30 but I still ended up around 1350-1400 elo. And I spent the off season learning more, studying, watching more pro streams, etc. Fast forward to S3. Time for some placement matches. I honestly tried to support my way through placement and well, after losing 5 that I can directly link to trolls and then some I was in bronze V. So I then thought ""hey maybe I should be the one doing damage instead of buying wards all the time."" So I tried to main adc for a while and ended up working up to bronze II. Then the usual bronze suspects showed up and after numerous games of trolls and/or people that are 0-8 by 20mins, I was back in bronze III. This pattern has repeated itself about 4 times now. I get promoted to II win a game or two then have numerous bad teammates (intentional or not) and wind up demoted back to III. Not to mention the numerous times I've had to try to get through because of, well you guessed it, trolls or the 0-8's.

Lately I got the idea that maybe I could influence games more by jungling or playing a lane that can roam easier like top. I've really started to love to play Elise or Kha'zix. But all my games seem hit or miss. Either my team does decently well and helping them gank their lanes is easy. Or every lane loses and I get caught trying to peel off the adc so maybe we can turn a fight around and gain some ground. Maybe it's just bad luck or maybe I should go back to adc but either way I've found myself on a losing skid that has me on the verge of being demoted to bronze IV.

I'm not trying to blame all my problems on my teams. Everyone has bad games from me to Evil Geniuses, we all play bad from time to time. I'll never be one to rage and make up excuses for playing bad. If I'm making bad plays I will openly admit it. But there seems to be a general assumption of the LoL community that ""elo hell"" isn't real and that everyone in bronze is bad and should be shunned there forever. I will argue that is not the case. LoL is a team game and if you can't rely on your team to fill their role properly, then you will lose the game. No matter how good you are, one person cannot win a team game on their own. They certainly can help influence the outcome, but they cannot straight up win it on their own. The current tier system seems to only account for wins/losses in determining if you move up or down and by how much. And for someone like me who almost always win their lane, this bugs the crap out of me. You can have unlucky placement and get stuck where you shouldn't be (maybe this was me) or you can have a lucky streak or get carried and get stuck where you shouldn't be (I wish this was me). Having an unlucky streak can also seriously harm you in trying to progress. I honestly kind of prefer the old elo system because of this.

I'm now over 200 games in bronze. Based on my understanding of the tier system, I think it's safe to say I'm not moving out anytime soon or at all this season. I'm honestly considering giving up on soloq for the rest of this season and just playing normals or arams or whatever. Maybe I might try and find a team to play with. But who wants someone in bronze tier?

Please refrain from the usual ""stay positive"" or ""you have to carry the team on your back through mud and fire"" type of comments. I can honestly say I never rage and try my hardest to stay positive through every match. I've also already said my two cents on carrying in this game.

TL:DR; S2 around 1400 elo. Stuck in bronze, whether it's just luck or lack thereof or something I'm not doing right in my games. Probably giving up on soloq.

**EDIT** Wow I'm honestly overwhelmed by the number of responses. Some of you have offered some great advice. So perhaps not all is lost and I should just keep on fighting soloq. I will try to get a stream or some replays up soon.

To be a bit more specific about the situation, for who's on your own team there's a couple of possible scenarios: 1) Your team are all pros too. I guess this would make it easier to rely on getting carried and allow more room for mistakes with others picking up the slack. 2) Your team are a group of noobs who you consistently play and learn with. This could help with developing more strategy than ""we'll try and do as much work for you as possible"". 3) Your team are a random group of noobs who are different every time.

1363591758.0,31,self.summonerschool,1aihuz,Advice on watching friendly minion health,Tuchit,37,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1aihuz/advice_on_watching_friendly_minion_health/,"The fact that you have to constantly watch enemy minion health in order to last hit is indisputable. A lot of players, however, seem to ignore watching their friendly minions' health bars, oblivious to the opportunities it opens up. I argue here that watching your friendly minions' health bars is almost as important as watching enemy minions, if not just as important.

Watching your friendly minions' health bars allows you to predict the future. I mean, take for example a mid lane matchup. We'll say you're playing Brand, and your opponent is Malzahar. You're both level 4. You're watching your friendly minions' health bars, and you notice a caster minion getting low. Malzahar is going to come in to last hit that minion. You know this before he moves at all because you know that's what any reasonable player would do, assuming he feels safe doing it. **Capitalize on this fact.** Wait for Malzahar to set up for an auto attack, and right when he stops to start the animation, throw your Pillar of Flame right on top of him. There goes a huge chunk of his health all because he just wanted that gold. Repeat this a couple of times and he'll be low. Enter zoning. This is the point where he'll either have to run back to base licking his wounds or risk getting hit by an E - Q - W - AA combo, killing him instantly. With melee opponents this is like shooting fish in a barrel.

Or hey, let's talk about support. You're a support Zyra with bush control up against an enemy Draven. When he comes in for a last hit, just before he starts his auto attack animation, throw your E down. He'll either have to abandon the lasthit or take your E. Throw a couple of seeds on top of him with a Q for a very frustrated Draven.

But wait, there's more. By watching minion health bars, you can understand wave control even better. If your friendly minions have more health than the enemy minions, and your opponent is last hitting normally, the wave is likely to push towards his tower. If his minions have more health than yours, the lane is likely to push towards your tower. You can tell your jungler to come soon because he's going to be exposed to a gank. If you want to take this to the next level, check your lanes as jungler. Not only the number of minions but also their health bars matter here.

Ganking a lane? Wait until the opponent is going in for a last hit on a caster minion and jump him. It will be the perfect opportunity because the few in-game feet that he has to run can make the difference between a successful gank and an unsuccessful one. Obviously if he's already super pushed this isn't necessary, but hey, it can make a difference.

So I finally surpassed the Silver I barrier and have been up and down between Gold IV &amp; V. I feel that this range is exactly my skill level and Idon't blame my teammates for 'holding me back' in the least.

Given this admission, that I deserve to be where I am, what skill set do I need to improve on the most to make that Jump to Platinum V, or at least Gold I range? I feel like I have the mechanics down. I have very comfortable keybinds, I can orb walk if needed, I can kite well, and all of that sort of thing. I time my dragons/barons always and then also buffs/flashes if I'm jungling or roaming hard. I have about 5 champions I play at a high level, lux mid, taric/sona/alistar bottom, and numerous junglers/tanky tops. If you could summarize how you see my current skill set to what is needed to reach Platinum level, please do so. 

Also, explaining the silver -&gt; gold -&gt; plat range for everyone would be cool.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1ai8qc,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ai8qc/looking_for_explanation_of_skill_set_difference/,

Hey guys, My name is Shakarez and I'm part of the LoLpro staff, a site where we have guides by all the champions. All the guides are done by High Elo players. I also manage the content on a youtube channel called LoLvods.

Today I posted the first LoLpro video guide, covering Vayne. I'll be covering a different guide once a week.

S2 1800+ Elo Jungle Main Player   

A lot of people have been wondering about the changes to the S2 jungle and what it means for junglers, clear times, etc. Here is my personal chart on detailed clear times in S2 and S3 with notes. I hope people can use it to learn when and who to counter-jungle effectively and understand how the jungle has changed. I really tried to create a benchmark for champions in the jungle.   

There are 4 concluding points that I have added to the bottom on my personal thoughts about the changes and effects, as well as detailed comments on my blog article

I spent ~10 hours on this, so enjoy!

1346832737.0,31,self.summonerschool,zduj7,Banning Strategies,Kienan,33,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/zduj7/banning_strategies/,"Hello,

I haven't been spending as much time here as I should, and I wanted to share something that I think many of you may find helpful, and something I see people *very* often *not* utilizing in solo queue. I'm not claiming it's revolutionary, it's actually fairly basic, but I thought I'd write it out. As I said, I've seen many people not taking advantage of this.

Simply put, you should try to think of the banning phase as a competitive mini-game in its own right. Especially if you are first pick (blue side,) but this can be applied to all ban phases.

Let's say you're first pick/ban, and you have three champions that you *absolutely* do not want to see in the hands of your opponents, but know that the other side probably doesn't want to see them either. For example, Shen, Malphite, and the dreaded cow. Now, you could simply ban them all yourself, and that's a valid choice. However, you can get 'free' bans if you make your opponents ban some of these. So, instead of first banning Shen, ban a slightly less popular champ like Darius, because he's an asshole. Your opponent is now almost *forced* to ban Shen, or risk leaving him open to you, since you get first pick. If they ban one of the 'big three' for you next, ban someone else you don't like, like Blitz. BEEP BOOP, NOT THIS GAME.

As long as they continue to ban your bans for you, you can ban slightly less powerful luxury bans. If both team captains have similar thoughts on bans, they should have just banned all three of your bans for you, giving you three free bans. If they leave someone open, first pick them, or ban them if no one plays that champ.

How does this work if you're second pick? Well, the same, but you have to let them make the first move, or risk leaving someone open for first pick. If they open up with a Shen ban, for instance, you get another free ban. If they keep banning the common bans, you still get free bans, even though you're second pick. Just remember to ban people you really don't want to see, but give your opposing captain a chance to ban it *first*. If they first ban Shen, ban Darius, or whoever. If they second ban anyone but Malphite/Alistar (again, these are just examples, use your own ban priorities!), your safest bet is to ban one, so go ahead. They could still third ban the other, though, giving you another free ban.

**TL;DR: Don't think of the banning phase as some cooperative 'let's work together to ban OP champs' pansy shit. Bans are a competitive mini-game, and should be treated as such. If you're first pick, it's 'If you don't want me to first pick Champ X, Y, or Z, *you* ban them, sucker!' Second pick is similar, but you need to wait for your opponent to 'waste' a ban on commonly banned champs.**",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,default,True,t3_zduj7,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/zduj7/banning_strategies/,

Granted this situation is silly to add in, but there is a specific situation I want to focus in on, and that is [](/oracleselixir ""Oracles Elixir"") [](/elixirofbrilliance ""Elixir of Brilliance"") [](/elixiroffortitude ""Elixir of Fortitude"") [](/elixirofagility ""Elixir of Agility"") [](/visionward ""Vision Ward"")

[](/healthpotion ""Health Potion"") - These give you sustain in lane (10 HP per second) and can help you win certain skirmishes in lane. Start these in most lanes and most ALL matchups for mobility and sustain.

[](/manapotion ""Mana Potion"") - Noone gives a fuck about these anymore, but they help people stay in lane which is good and provide a form of sustain. Also they got buffed with the -5 gold purchase cost. Meh item (Never start these)

[](/sightward ""Sight Ward"") - Buy these

[](/visionward ""Vision Ward"") - Buy these to take out enemy sight wards and to easier take control of objectives with lack of oracles. Also good for baron control when the enemy wants to ward and you can keep taking them out with your vision. Good vs stealth's as well.

[](/oracleselixir ""Oracles Elixir"") - So this will obviously help you kill wards and assist in the killing of invisible units, but not only does it do that, but I contributes to the negative inpact on an enemy teams map control. With no wards you cant really do anything objective wise especially if you are behind. Do not buy this if you run the risk of losing it early on and basically wasting money that could have gone to other things. Be careful.

[](/elixiroffortitude ""Elixir of Fortitude"") - This elixir specifically can help you negate ignite damage since passive HP gain does not factor in with the healing reduction cost. This is an amazing bait tool for top and potentially bot lane on an AD carry. Elixirs and general are bought for forcing baron so that you are just the little bit stronger. Ad's should focus on the [](/elixiroffortitude ""Elixir of Fortitude"") since it gives HP and AD, but you can also go [](/elixirofagility ""Elixir of Agility"") if you are safe and have enough AD. Tops should get Red and mages get [](/elixirofbrilliance ""Elixir of Brilliance""). Junglers are allways poor :3

**Boots**

[](/berserkersgreaves ""Berserker's Greaves"") A good item for champions that rely on their auto attacks heavily and specifically is the priority AD carry item. In some cases champions like [](/Irelia ""Irelia"") can buy these boots since she has the CC reduction passive and dosent need tenacity

[](/ninjatabi ""Ninja Tabi"") A great item for champions that want to counter AD. Specifically junglers like [](/drmundo ""Dr. Mundo"") Can get an early ninja tabi so he can DRAGON at level 6 without fear. Also the 10% damage reduction is pretty crazy versus some forms of burst, but most AP burst is better countered by MR

[](/mercurystreads ""Mercury's Treads"") Best boots in the game. PERIOD. ._. ""What you mean to say is that Mercury Treads are valuable because they provide Tenacity, lowering the effectiveness of stuns and slows placed on your champion""

[](/sorcerersshoes ""Sorcerer's Shoes"") Gives great magic pen that does indeed stack, but the movement does not :3. AP carry go to item to maximize early damage escpecially vs opponents whom fail to run MR blues or have some form of MR (YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH DO TRUE DAMAGE IN MOST CASES).

[](/ionianbootsoflucidity ""Ionian Boots of Lucidity"") OP [](/vladimir ""Vladimir"") boots. Lol Anyways perfect item for that need to cap your CDR in an easier and more cost efficient way.

[](/bootsofmobility ""Boots of Mobility"") Great boots for agressive (I get it on all supports) supports because it allows you to easily zone enemies and even chase in prolonged fights. Also great boots for utility junglers that want to initiate fights. E.g. [](/alistar ""Alistar"") [](/skarner ""Skarner"") [](/maokai ""Maokai"")

[](/bootsofswiftness ""Boots of Swiftness"") Probably one of the less used boots and for a good reason, because all it gives is movement and no additional stats, but that being said it is actually alot of MS. People like Takashi X's [](/twistedfate ""Twisted Fate"") buy's boots of swiftness to better increase Tf's overall shitty mobility

**A-Z Items**

[](/abyssalscepter ""Abyssal Scepter"") The famous Azingy [](/amumu ""Amumu"") has brought this item back into superb public viability as a good AP and MR item. Not only was Azingy a person whom showed this item the light of day, but if you can recall Reginald's [](/ahri ""Ahri"") built very tanky with a [](/abyssalscepter ""Abyssal Scepter"") and it allowed him to easily trade with the enemy mid laner. I like this item on certain junglers and certain mid laners. If you are getting crushed by people like [](/kassadin ""Kassadin"") or [](/leblanc ""Leblanc"") this item can also come in handy. The Aura it gives is also pretty crazy especially for AOE comps that have alot of magical damage (Most do).

[](/aegisofthelegion ""Aegis Of the Legion"") A must buy team item (Generally bought on supports) because it buffs your entire team with Armor, Damage, and Magic Resist. I would argue that it is one of the better items in the game team wise and really has so many benefits. It also benefits you because you get HP along with all the buffs the aura gives! It can also be bought on some junglers and even some top lanes! Never underestimate this item. Generally bought after you get your GP10's or after [](/shurelyasreverie ""Shurelya's Reverie"").

[](/archangelsstaff ""Archangels Staff"") Good item for mid laners that are very mana dependant such as [](/karthus ""Karthus"") and or [](/kogmaw ""Kog'Maw""). Provides a growing mana pool via spell casts that builds from [](/tearofthegoddess ""Tear of the Goddess""). Also gives AP, 400 mana, Mana regen, and AP via percentage of the amount of mana you have. Situational item indeed, but aside that a pretty good item for AP mids. NEVER BUY ON MANALESS CHAMPS CAUSE ENTIRE TEAM WILL BE LIKE WAT [](/katarina ""RETARD"")

ATHENES UNHOLY GRAIL: Expensive item for what its worth but gives nice defensive stats. Its basically a strong early game [](/rodofages ""Rod of Ages"") that will last you the entirety of the game because it has so many beneficial stats. I like this item for people like [](/galio) and [](/anivia) and even AP [](/kog)

[](/atmasimpaler ""Atmas Impaler"") Good item if you have at least 2k hp because it scales off of your HP! It was nerfed recently, but still is viable since it gives other stats such as armor and crit chance. I get on most of my top laners still [](/leesin ""Lee Singah"")

[](/avariceblade ""Avarice Blade"") Decent GP10 item for junglers that are building into [](/youmuusghostblade ""Youmuu's Ghostblade"") and an alright item for some top laners to start raking in the gold. Crits for days.

[](/bansheesveil ""Banshee's Veil"") Amazing counter initiation item for high priority targets. This item can really restrict and enemy team chosing their engages if they have to open up with a cc or some form of burst combo that will be negated. I like this item situationally of course as it is very expensive and [](/quicksilversash ""QQ"") is much cheaper and provides nearly the same protection. I'd buy this on AP's such as [](/kogmaw ""Kog'Maw"") [](/ryze ""Ryze"") ETC.

[](/bilgewatercutlass ""Bilgewater Cutlass"") Good item buildup into [](/hextechgunblade ""RIP LEE SIN""). Preferably on [](/jax ""Jax"") I go [](/bootsofspeed ""Boots"") double [](/doransblade ""Doran's Blade"") into [](/bilgewatercutlass ""Bilgewater Cutlass"") then maybe a [](/phage ""Phage"") into [](/hextechgunblade ""RIP LEE SIN""). I like the lifesteal this item provides for the cost along with the slow active. :3 

[](/catalysttheprotector ""Catalyst The Protector"") Decent item for laners especially whom have no natural form of sustain such as... a majority of mid lane champions. Gives decent HP and mana for the cost along with a relatively cheap buildup. 

[](/chaliceofharmony ""Chalice of Harmony"") Chalice has come into play more now with the addition of Athenes unholy grail. Allways been an amazing item for people whom need the mana regen and MR such as [](/anivia ""Anivia"") and [](/galio ""Galio"").  

[](/deathfiregrasp ""Deathfire Grasp"") Great burst AP item for mid laners. Works perfectly for people like [](/annie ""Annie"") and [](/veigar ""Veigar""). Overall CDR, and AP and % damage. 

[](/doransblade ""Doran's Blade"") AD carries and Top laners pride and joy. AD carries generally want these because it gives a form of tankiness with the 80 HP, 3% lifesteal gives them sustain, and the 10 AD is nice for a measly 475 gold. Top laners get these instead of wriggles if they need effective HP vs their matchup

[](/doransring ""Doran's Ring"") AP carries specifically get these to enchance their laning sustain w/ mana. Think of champs like [](/morgana ""Morgana""), [](/cassiopeia ""Cassiopeia""), [](/ahri ""Ahri"") Etc. Same HP rules apply in all doran items giving some good beginning tankiness in a relatively cheap item. Also gives AP so mages can pew pew harder. 

[](/doransshield ""Doran's Shield"") Unlike the other doran items, this one has 120 HP instead of the 80 HP on its offensive counterparts. The HP regen and armor allows for certain champs like [](/Vlad ""Vlad"") and [](/shen ""Shen"") to sustain. The reasoning [](/vladimir ""Vladimir"") would get a dorans shield is if he is versus a really heavy physical damage opponent such as [](/riven ""Riven"") or [](/renekton ""Renekton"")

[](/emblemofvalor ""Emblem of Valor"") Okay item buildup for the cost. Gives decent armor and HP regen aura. IMO I dont value [](/locketoftheironsolari ""WAT"") as much as most support players but eh, its alright in my mind. 

[](/executionerscalling ""Executioners Calling"") Good item versus teams without ignite (But really?). In retrospect for the price its an alright early game item for top laners to eliminate the healing functionality of a chapion. Perhaps versus people like [](/vladimir ""hue"") or [](/swain ""NOXUS"").

[](/forceofnature ""Force of Nature"") Great item versus AP centric teams. The movement speed helps a tad but isnt very noticeable in fights. I believe the strongest part of this item is the % HP regen. This coupled with something like a warmogs and a spirit visage will make people like [](/drmundo ""MOONDOH"") very scary. 

[](/frozenheart ""Frozen Heart"") Arguably one of the best items in the entire game. Gives CDR, Mana, 99 armor, and an attack speed slow debuff for enemies. This is like the god tier item for bruisers. People like [](/olaf ""Br0macicaca"") [](/malphite ""Rawk Solid"") are amazing with this because of the CDR it gives allowing him to use E effectively more so than before (obviously). 

[](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet"") Gives HP, AA slow on every attack, and it gives some damage. Great item for bruisers that are having difficulties chasing (or dont and just wanna be jerks). 

[](/giantsbelt ""Giants Belt"") Good buildup item for champions who want to build into all of the following [](/giantsbelt  ""so much hp"") items. Main part of most of the items except for [](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet"")'s case because [](/phage) is better since it gives more effective stats. 

[](/glacialshroud ""Glacial Shroud"") As I said about [](/frozenheart ""Frozen Heart"") ""Arguably one of the best items in the entire game"" , so I dont really need to explain how good of a buildup it is. It gives Armor, Mana, and CDR. 

[](/guardianangel ""Guardian Angel"") The AD carry [](/zhonyashourglass ""Zhonya's"") essentially. This is a ""High priority"" fail safe essentially. If you are stomping the enemy and you get GA... then if they manage to kill you then they have to kill you twice, so the likeliness of you winning that fight is high because if your team is any bit fed as you then you win because the enemy blew all their shit for you. Anyways I like this item because it gives some decent defenses and as I noted its like a reset button for a fight. You can also bait alot of ulti's with this thing. Be careful though, because just cause you have a GA dosent make you god. You can still lose.

[](/guinsoosrageblade ""Guinsoos Rageblade"") Alright item for going old school [](/jax ""Jax"") build. I havent looked into the item much for anyone anymore because its outscaled by other items at this point in time. It gives decent attack speed and AP/AD for the price, but lategame there's just better items.

[](/hauntingguise ""Haunting Guise"") Meh item for ap's. It was going to get buffed to give movement speed, but sadly nothing has changed. Its lost its viability over time as other items are just naturally better.

[](/heartofgold ""Heart of Gold"") Great support/jungler/top laner/ap mid (going gp10 build). Gives alot of HP for the price and along w/ the 5gp10. You can go [](/heartofgold ""HoG"") first on tanky supports so you have easier initiates with more HP.

[](/hexdrinker ""Hexdrinker"") Good MR item with AD. Perfect item for people like [](/riven ""Riven"") and [](/olaf ""Olaf"") versus people like [](/kennen ""Kennen"") and [](/rumble ""Rumble""). In some cases you cant just build straight MR to counter Ap's so you need some form of damage to deal with them.

[](/hextechgunblade ""Hextech Gunblade"") Great item for champions that scale off AP and AD (Who dosent). Specifically champions like [](/mordekaiser ""Morde"") and [](/katarnia"" Kat""). The active is pretty op too whilst you one combo someone :3.

[](/hextechrevolver ""Most OP item"") Super sustain [](/vladimir ""Vlad""). You sad? Its k. Anyways great Ap along with the ridiculous ability to sustain your damage with your spells... which is probably one of the more broken things in this game IMO. AKA if you have no mana or a constant blue buff then you are godlike essentially. People without sustain cant trade with you unless they burst you, have ignite, or their jungler comes.

[](/infinityedge ""Infinity Edge"") Strongest item in the game mathematically. Enough said. Does the most damage consistantly over the course of 10 seconds because of the Increased crit damage and already high base AD value. This is the reason why AD carries are fucking crazy, because of this one item. Also jokingly it makes [](/garen ""DAMACIA!"") pretty scary.

[](/ionicspark ""Ionic Spark"") Great pushing item especially with the recent buffs to the damage. Gives decent HP and has seen alot of love from [](/udyr ""Oh deer"") [](/shen ""Shawn"") and even some [](/irelia ""Irelia"") players. Gives alot of attack speed for the item buildup and as I said the HP value is decent.

[](/kagesluckypick ""Kage's Lucky Pick"") So this is actually a reference from the Tenacious D movie. OP... anyways gives decent AP and 5 gp10. Builds into [](/deathfiregrasp ""DFG"") so its a good item to net early on in the game for ap's if you have an idea into building it.

[](/kindlegem ""Kindlegem"") Great buildup item for supports. Gives CDR, and 200 HP. Builds into so many items that im not gonna list them all here. 

[](/lastwhisper ""Last Whisper"") Must buy AD carry item versus armor. Essentially that all I should put, but there is more obviously since people will argue about the effectiveness of [](/theblackcleaver ""Black Cleaver""). SO mathematically [](/theblackcleaver ""Black Cleaver"") will do more damage on enemies with less than 200 armor. SO lategame when you need to kill that xx420Kusmaster420xx armor malphite.... ._. then obviously get your [](/lastwhisper ""Last Whisper"") and kill him. 40% armor pen... die tanks, thanks :d.

[](/lichbane ""Lichbane"") Amazing burst AP item for champions like [](/twistedfate ""TF"") that rely on their auto attacks or a combo to do massive damage. [](/sion ""Sion"") is also a good example of someone I would buy this on. This is good for ap's because THE DAMAGE YOU DO ON YOU AA'S (Auto attacks) IS BASED OFF YOUR AP. Its an AP [](/trinityforce ""Tri Force"") essentially.

[](/locketoftheironsolari ""Locket of the Iron Solari"") 300 HP, 35 armor, and HP regen aura. 230 HP effective shield @ level 18. Decent item for the price for support players, but I still believe that building into randuins with your [](/heartofgold ""Heart of Gouuud"") is more beneficial to you. Still works in team comps that are taking alot of burst AOE damage to further mitigate it. Also its derived from [](/leona ""Playtonics"") lore so... yeah thats pretty coo.

[](/malady ""Malady"") Attack speed, Mr shred, magic damage per auto attack, and AP. A great item for people like [](/teemo ""Teemo"") whom scale off of their AP and attack speed. Old [](/twitch ""Twitch"") used to work with the 5 [](/malady ""Malady"") build :3

MANAMUNE: Good item for heroes that need high base mana and attack damage along with mana regen. This item works for [](/yorick ""Yorick"") and [](/urgot ""Urgot"") specifically because it gives decent AD and you need mana in order to do anything with both of these heroes. I like manamune specifically only on these heroes thus far.

[](/mawofmalmortius ""Maw of Malmortius"") Maw is a good item that builds from [](/hexdrinker ""Orange Juice Sword""). Provides MR, AD, that stupid shield, and Damage per % you are missing. OP OP. In reality I get this on people like [](/olaf ""Br0maciiaa"") and things like that.

[](/morelloseviltome ""Morello's Evil Tome"") Ideally same concept as [](/executionerscalling ""Executioners Calling""), but giving AP and CDR instead of lifesteal and crit. SITUATIONAL ITEMS OP.

[](/nashorstooth ""Nashor's Tooth"") Okay item for champions whom need AP, Cdr, and attack speed. Thankfully [](/teemo ""Teemo"") for some reason benefits from all three. Granted this item is a tad bit in-viable in most AP mid cases. Its an ""alright item"" IMO. Situationally it might work on people like [](/nautilus ""Nautilus"").

[](/phage ""Phage"") Phage is an amazing item and a beautiful build up item into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") and [](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet""). Preferablly you go [](/phage ""Phage"") first into your build up of the corresponding items because it is the best item that builds into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"").

[](/phantomdancer ""Phantom Dancer"") AD carries main source of damage figuratively since it gives the best stats for Ad's aside from the actual damage portion. Movement speed coupled with crit and attack speed will change their dps greatly. I generally go [](/phantomdancer ""Phantom Dancer"") after my main damage item (such as) [](/infinityedge ""Infinity Edge"") or [](/thebloodthirster ""Bloodthirster""). The only AD I would ever build [](/phantomdancer ""Phantom Dancer"") first on would probably be [](/kogmaw ""Kock maw"") since he has amazing damage with his W on. Also if you are supported by people like [](/janna ""Jenga"") or [](/nunu ""Nunu"") you get either a shield that is a free [](/bfsword ""B.F. Sword"") or an attack speed buff that further increases your already high DPS.

[](/philosophersstone ""Philosopher's Stone"") The ""Gp10 item"" Gives HP regen and 5gp10. Has a good buildup into [](/shurelyasreverie ""Shurelya's Reverie"") but it is one of the more expensive gp10's.

[](/quicksilversash ""Quicksilver Sash"") AD CARRIES BES ITEM. Anyways provides decent MR and an amazing active. You can get out of ALL forms of CC and most if not all activate's on items, champions spells such as [](/mordekaiser ""Morde"") Ult and [](/vladimir ""Vlad"") ult. 

[](/rabadonsdeathcap ""Rabadon's Deathcap"") Essential AP item for all mid laners. Gives the highest AP damage in the game and is a must as I said for mid laners.

[](/randuinsomen ""Randuin's Omen"") Great item for straight up countering auto attackers in general. Pretty much an AD counter item and counters people such as [](/irelia ""NERF""). Gives decent 

[](/rodofages ""Rod of Ages"") Decent item for AP mids. Gives some tankiness and HP. Also gives a form of sustain from the catalyst passive. :3 [](/karthus ""R TO WIN"") Loves this item ;).

[](/rylaiscrystalscepter ""Rylai's Crystal Scepter"") Gives HP, ap, and a slow on spell casts. Great item for most mages like [](/swain) or [](/ahri).

[](/sheen ""Sheen"") Strong buildup into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") and [](/lichbane ""Lichbane"") 

[](/shurelyasreverie ""Shurelya's Reverie"") Support item and utility jungler item. Gives the HP regen and HP along with the movement speed active. Buy this item to better engage or disengage fights to maximize your teams utility.

[](/soulshroud ""Soul Shroud"") Decent item for HP and cdr, but there's alot better items out there. Dont buy this item on supports first plzzzz.

[](/spiritvisage ""Spirit Visage"") Amazing item for counter AP and the passive allows for some crazy sustain. People like [](/renekton ""rararararawr"") and [](/vladimir ""Vlad"") can benefit from this is they are constantly bogged down by magic damage.

[](/sunfirecape ""Sunfire Cape"") Sunfire gives decent armor and HP as an early game item. Azingy's [](/amumu ""mumu"") build [](/sunfirecape) and [](/abyssalscepter) for the crazy AOE magic shred (yeah that damage is affected by the magic pen) :3. This item can also work on [](/shen) to splitpush better. Earlyish game item.

[](/tearofthegoddess ""Tear of the Goddess"") Stacking continually increasing mana pool item. I like this item on [](/ryze ""Ryze"") since he scales so well with mana. Also works with certain laners like AP (/kogmaw ""Kog'maw"") since he is very mana reliant.

[](/theblackcleaver ""The Black Cleaver"") Mathematically [](/theblackcleaver ""Black Cleaver"") will do more damage on enemies with less than 200 armor. SO lategame when you need to kill that xx420Kusmaster420xx armor malphite.... ._. then obviously get [](/lastwhisper ""Last Whisper""). This is basically a snowball item for certain champions. In solo q when im playing [](/ezreal ""Ezreal"") ill get it to further increase my snowball (if I already am) or in certain situations like the Imaqtpie [](/corki ""Corki"") [](/taric ""Taric"") armor shred combo. Situational item once again.

[](/thebloodthirster ""The Bloodthirster"") Stacking physical damage and sustain item. Must buy for ad carries later on because its the ""best"" sustain item for ad's. also provides 100 AD fully stacked. 

[](/thebrutalizer ""The Brutalizer"") Good item early game versus heavy armor top lanes, or lanes that you want to dominate because of their lack of armor. I like this item on [](/jarvan ""J4"") if im winning lane.

[](/thornmail ""Thornmail"") Good item versus non sustain physical damage. 

[](/tiamat ""Tiamat"") Pretty trolly item IMO. Provides ""decent"" stats for its price but there are better buys. Probably works best on [](/fiora ""Bitch"") more than anything else in this game.

[](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") Provides [](/corki ""Corks"") and [](/ezreal ""PFE"") utility and burst. Thats pretty much it. Phantom dancer is better late game but an early game [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") wrecks everything. Also works on bruisers and junglers beautifully as well giving the auto attack slow and just overall solid damage, but the item is very expensive (most expensive in the game).

[](/voidstaff ""Void Staff"") Enemies building MR? DIE ENEMY. Really just buy this if the enemies build MR... enough said.

[](/wardensmail ""Warden's Mail"") Good item to actually get early. Yes... early, reasoning is cause that stupid slow that it gives is just... ugh I hate it. Gives decent armor, passive is stupid, and gives HP regen.

[](/warmogsarmor ""Warmog's Armor"") YOU WANT HP? YOU LIKE TO FARM? Here's 1.3k hp.. here ya go. Great item for bruisers although [](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet"") is better, but if you build [](/trinityforce ""Tri Force"") anyways then you dont need no dumb [](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet"") ;) HP, and HP regen IS SO DUMB.

[](/willoftheancients ""Will of the Ancients"") Most broken item in the game, because it gives the best sustain out of every item and with the addition of double [](/willoftheancients ""Will of the Ancients"") AP top and mid comps are stupid good. Granted thats not the only reason, but its one of them.

[](/witsend ""Wit's End"") Amazing item for junglers and top laners that need damage and a decent amound of MR. Does stacking damage on auto attacks and gives attack speed. [](/shen) [](/irelia) approve!

[](/wriggleslantern ""Wriggles Lantern"") Good early game item versus physical damage to better sustain in either the jungle or top lane. Self explanatory early game item.

[](/youmuusghostblade ""Youmuu's Ghostblade"") Decent jungler and top laner item after you build into brutalizer. Generally you can get this item on people like [](/nocturne ""Nocturne"") in the jungle and do immense damage if snowballed. This item is probably on a top 10 list of snowbally items. The Movespeed buff it gives while activated is pretty crazy and allows for netting some easy kills w/ redbuff as a jungler. 

[](/zeal ""Zeal"") Zeal is probably the last item you might build into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force""), but it also has an amazing buildup into [](/phantomdancer ""Phantom Dancer"") You generally get [](/zeal ""Zeal"") after [](/thebloodthirster ""The Bloodthirster"") or [](/infinityedge ""Infinity Edge"").

[](/zekesherald ""Zeke's Herald"") Good item for a AD heavy team comp, and just a good buy for supports in general to better buff your AD carry with the lifesteal aura. It also provides decent HP and some good team wide buffs. This is a must buy after your [](/shurelyasreverie ""Shurelya's Reverie"") and [](/aegisofthelegion ""Aegis Of the Legion"").

[](/zhonyashourglass ""Zhonya's Hourglass"") Perfect item for AP mids when they need decent armor and the ability to control fights with a ""reset button"". This would be their one and only reset button item wise other than a [](/guardianangel ""Guardian Angel""). You can do beautiful things with this item such as a 5 man ultimate via [](/morgana ""Morgana"") or a bait a whole team to waste all their aoe's on you whilst in your stasis.

(see post inside),makesufeelgood,32,2,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/upfov/anyone_interested_in_this_see_post_inside/,"**FINAL EDIT**:  I have added all of you that listed your summoner names.  Mine is Skrubswag, so if you see an invite from me do not decline it.  Like I said, I'll check throughout the day and if enough of you are on we'll get a custom game going.  I will also ask around in the PVP.net chatroom and the IRC room to see if any others want to play.  However, I have to go out for a few hours.  I will add anyone to my friend's list who responds to this post when I get back.

Trying to not make it sound too QQ here but I've been losing interest in playing normals/ranked recently.  Solo queuing is a nightmare and a few friends that I used to play premades with have switched to Diablo 3 for the time being (aka the rest of the summer).  However, I have not lost my passion for LoL itself and want to keep playing.  After some thought, I came up with this solution:

So, what I'm wondering is if anyone would be up for playing some custom games.  These would either be 3v3s, 4v4s, or 5v5s depending on level of interest overall and at any given time.  Now, the reason I'm posting this here in r/summonerschool is because I want it to be known that **ANYONE** is welcome to play in these.  Whether you are level 1 or level 30 with 1000+ wins.

I want these to be a no pressure atmosphere where we can still try our best during the game, but then afterwards go through and help each other out.  It should be a fun situation where we can emulate a solo queue environment without (hopefully) the ragers.  Also the fact that there are no stakes involved with winning or losing should help with attitude.

As well as playing these games to help improve and learn without having to solo queue, I am hoping that I (and anyone else) can meet some new summoners and if enough of us enjoy playing together, we might be able to find new groups of players to queue with in normals or even ranked games.

Hopefully you all get the gist of what this is about.  I'd like to start playing with more r/summonerschool people because I played a sunday night scrims game a while back when CrAzY MoFo 13 was still in charge and I really enjoyed that game (JUNGLE UDYR CARRY HARD FTW).  However, I am busy on Sundays most of the time and I really would not like to limit my time playing with you all to one day a week.

If there is some formal method already enacted of basically grouping people that want to play games, please let me know.  I checked the IRC and the reddit chat on PVP.net but neither seemed very active.  Otherwise, post here if you'd like to play some chill custom games.

**EDIT:  Oh and my internet.  My internet is sometimes crap where I'm living right now and don't want to lose Elo because of random ping spiking/complete disconnect.  Another reason I am not feeling the normals/ranked games.**

EDIT2:  Ok after pitching the idea a few times to some people, I just want to clarify what this is all about.  This is for people who would like to meet new people, practice new champions, or just don't feel quite comfortable queuing in normals/ranked yet.  These games would be played identical to normals/ranked games.  They're simply in house games geared towards the objectives listed above.  If you aren't interested, that's perfectly fine.  LoL is geared towards playing normals/ranked anyway.  But I know there are probably others out there who feel the same way I do right now, and hopefully playing some fun custom in-house games can be a way to pass the time before we're ready to dive back into normals/ranked.  And if you're not sure whether you want to or not, just try playing a game :D

EDIT3:  This is only open to summoners on the NA server for now.

EDIT4:  I've added all of you who have posted at the time of this edit.

1329172200.0,30,self.summonerschool,po3sx,"Lesson: Harassment Windows, Cooldowns",PriestPants,34,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/po3sx/lesson_harassment_windows_cooldowns/,"This is mainly a write-up I made for some friends of mine, but I figured that this sub might find it useful as well.

So. You queue for a game and get faced against someone. They jump in and harass you. You're down in the exchange.

""Oh god, what to do? I just keep playing different characters and getting out-harassed. When I try to harass them, it's like they knew what I was going to do. Maybe I need to just buy a different character and maybe they""-**NO. GET THE HELL OUT OF THE STORE AND ADDRESS THIS.**

Every champion has cooldowns. The vast, vast majority of players don't have the exact cooldown numbers memorized - just a general idea as to approximately how long it takes before people use that skill again. Ex: Kassadin. I don't really know what the cooldown on his ultimate is, but I know that he can't use it twice really fast. In other words, if he uses it **once**, he can't use it again **immediately** - which means he is vulnerable immediately after a teleport.

This may seem like basic knowledge to most of you, but this has very far-reaching implications. For instance, a lot of Sivir's damage is front-loaded into her Q. If she misses that, you should be able to exchange with her very, very favorably as any of the AD carries until it returns from CD. Also, if Swain just missed his snare, **he can't snare you**. Jump in and beat that bird-man up.

Most characters are fully capable of harassing in relatively small timing windows (0-3 seconds, I'd say) in which you just snap your important abilities, maybe do some auto attacks, and pull back behind your minions. Some characters want exchanges to go on longer (like Irelia) whereas some want them to end quickly (like Brand). You can tell because their kit is centered around hitting all the buttons really fast VS. passive benefits or spaced-out abilities. 

The trick to winning your lane is to figure out what the weakness of your opponent's character is. Most characters have cooldowns as a weakness. Twisted Fate can't stun you if he just threw a mana regen card. Nasus can't Q you if he just hit a minion with it. Ashe can't hurt really anyone at all if she just used a volley to farm. There are some characters that don't really have cooldowns as a weakness, like Teemo. But fuck Teemo. 

So yeah. Figure out the cooldown weakness of your enemy. Sion just threw up his shield? He can't detonate it immediately, and he can't refresh it very fast either. Taric just stunned you at a dumb time? MURDER HIM OUTRAGEOUSLY. The vast majority of people make lots of very readable skill usage mistakes in lane, like Sivir throwing up a shield too early or Veigar missing his stun. Capitalize on that crap and FB;GM. 

Conversely, if you screwed something up, be careful until it comes back. That's all. Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,default,True,t3_po3sx,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/po3sx/lesson_harassment_windows_cooldowns/,
1375976595.0,29,self.summonerschool,1jym1t,[Guide] Mordekaiser: The Master of AFK Mid,ForteEXE,34,5,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1jym1t/guide_mordekaiser_the_master_of_afk_mid/,"Hello there! Do you have a moment to talk about ~~Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ~~ **Mordekaiser, the Master of Metal**? Good!

Let's begin by discussing what Mordekaiser is. He's an **Ability Power Carry** typically played in **mid lane** or **top lane**. This will cover how to play him in **mid lane**. He's also one of the most easy-to-farm mid laner champions in the game and has a shield mechanic that makes him naturally tanky. His spells, except for ult, also drain HP! This gets mitigated later on via items that will be detailed.

For masteries, you should roll **21/9/0**. If you're feeling ballsy, you can go **19/0/11** and pick up spellvamp in utility. This guide will assume you do **21/9/0**.

For runes, you want to do this:

* Magic Penetration Reds
* Flat Armor Yellows
* Flat Magic Resistance (Or Scaling, use your preference here) Blues
* Ability Power Quintessences (If you're feeling badass and like you can get away with it, Spell Vampirism Quintessences work too. You can start with 9% spellvamp at level 1)

There's quite a few ways to build Morde. I'm going to cover the way I **personally** build Mordekaiser, this is not meant to be an end-all.

This is just how I do things, there's other ways like the DFG TOTALHELLDEATH BYE ADC BYE Morde build, for example.

Now then, the sort of Morde build I roll will depend on what I'm going against. Your starting items:

* If vs AP: Rejuve Bead + Two Wards + 4 Health Potions / Warding is KEY with Morde, you're susceptible as hell to ganks pre-revolver, you want to counteract that.

* If vs AD: Cloth Armor + 5 Health Potions / You won't have wards, play more passively. You're going to turn this into Seeker ASAP otherwise the enemy AD will have a field day with you.

Core items time. Now see I said earlier Morde can be built a few days, it's because recently I figured out why. If you meet 3 certain core items, you can really go from there to suit your playstyle.

**Core Items:**

* Sorcerer Shoes (Morde's ult scales with Mpen, you want as much as possible.)

* Liandry's Torment (Again, Morde's ult scales with Mpen + Riot changing the passive to not be reduced by DOTs makes it #1 on him)

* Spirit of the Spectral Wraith (This item first started seeing use on laners by high elo Vladimir players due to what it provides: CDR, AP and 20% spellvamp. It's a BEAUTIFUL item on Morde as well because Morde will benefit from the straight-out-the-box 20% spellvamp and scales nicely with CDR to keep spamming spells, thus shield up. I build this always over Will of the Ancients.)

A full build for me typically is:

**Vs AP**:

* Sorcerer Shoes
* Liandry's Torment
* Spirit of the Spectral Wraith
* Rylai's Crystal Scepter
* Rabadon's Deathcap
* Situational Item (Usually Void, or if they're doing a good job of focusing, Zhonya)

**Vs AD:**

* Sorcerer Shoes
* Liandry's Torment
* Spirit of the Spectral Wraith
* Zhonya's Hourglass
* Rabadon's Deathcap
* Situational Item (You may want to go Abyssal for an all-around tanky Morde or Void. Or if you feel like you can get away with it, go for Deathfire and try to nuke the most fed player on their team. There's many ways to go at this point.)

For spells, you want to use **Ignite** and **Flash**. Morde's ult + Ignite is what makes you have plenty of ADC pets.

We've covered items, let's talk more about his abilities. You want to max **R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W** for abilities. More indepth:

* Passive - Iron Man / 35% of Morde's spell damage is converted into a shield. Half reduction vs minions. This is how you generate shield, any source of spell-based damage from Mordekaiser will generate shield.

* Q - Mace of Spades / Morde's secondary farming tool, this will echo out and deal more damage to enemies behind the target. If the target is alone, it deals increased damage! This ability is notable for **also having an Attack Damage Modifier**. Scaling is: **1.0 per bonus attack damage, .4 per ability point**. If alone, the damage is **1.65 per AD, .66 per AP**. Base damage is increased 65% as well. Also note it resets Mordekaiser's autoattack and works like Twisted Fate's Pick a Card (W) and Fizz's Urchin Strike (Q) in that it will convert items such as Sheen into magic damage. Health cost per use is: **25/32/39/46/53**.

* W - Creeping Death / Mordekaiser's armor/MR steroid spell. This will, for **six seconds** create an aura around Mordekaiser, granting bonus armor/magic resistance and dealing AOE magic damage. At rank 1 you will receive 10 armor/MR, rank 5 you will receive 30 of both. This ability scales at **.2 ability power**. Health cost per use is: **26/32/38/44/50**.

* E - Siphon of Destruction / Mordekaiser's main farming and pushing tool. This ability is a **cone-based skillshot** and will deal 70/115/160/205/250 damage with a **.6 ability power modifier** to all enemies caught within it. This is typically how you will maintain your shield most of the time, especially combined with Q. Health cost is: **24/36/48/60/72**.

* R - Children of the Grave / This is Mordekaiser's ultimate spell, and what makes him a terror in teamfights. Typically you want to use this on the enemy's ADC (now called Marksman by Riot). It has no health cost and scales with the target's maximum HP and will grant you health stolen half initially and half over time. Scaling for it is **24/29/34% + .04 ability power**. But wait! That's not all. See, if a targeted champion dies under the effect, you **gain control of their soul, represented as a cloned enemy champion pet** for a total of **30 seconds**. Meaning if you ghost an enemy Vayne and they die, you have a pet Vayne to wreak havoc on their team! Fun, huh? Try to save this for the ADC in teamfights. Note: This ability will **stack** with spellvamp, so you will receive extra HP stolen on top of what the ult grants you by default.

Those're the basic overview. I intend to go back and fix mistakes, let's talk about matchups. **Disclaimer**: Some (mainly under who counters Morde) will be theorycrafted, as I've not done that particular matchup or haven't done it enough, but have my thoughts on how it'd go. When noted, please use at your own risk. It may not work the way I think it would.

**Matches you win**:

* Vladimir / Vladimir wants to sustain and afk farm and poke you. You're Mordekaiser, you don't put up with that. Once you hit revolver, you're more of a terror faster and he's going to have a very hard time outpushing you or outsustaining. Your ult will also work in pool, combine it with Ignite for bloodstains all over the place.

* Morgana / It was once said on r/leagueoflegends this quote during 2011 and early/mid 2012: ""You know how nobody can outpush or outsustain Morgana? Well turns out that nobody wears spiky armor and goes huehuehueBR?"". It's true. Mordekaiser will outpush her, outsustain her (when he gets revolver) and generally be a pain in her ass. Beware, she'll likely start roaming early and give up mid, you need to take mid and go roam.

* LeBlanc/Syndra/Lux/Insert Generic Burst Champ Here - Mordekaiser gives absolutely zero damns about the fancy burst damage they can put out. His shield absorbs it and he can still maintain it if they engage around minions. Now beware, if they're smart, they WILL catch you without your shield up. There's some exceptions though, listed lower on. Note on Lux: Always watch when she leaves lane to ult bot/top during a fight or gank. This is a vital thing to do vs any Lux and not just in general. Credit goes to **AsheIsElite** for this tip.

* Fizz/Kassadin / These two, being assassins, struggle with naturally tanky champions and Morde is no exception. He can easily outpush either and generally doesn't fear them. If they rush Morello (more for Kass than Fizz who has it naturally) or get jungler ganks, then you'll have a problem.

* Karthus / He has something in his favor: He can still press R even if feeding and his lategame trumps your's. Win early, gank sidelanes or you're going to have a problem. He can't outpush you early, nor will he outsustain. But do not ever underestimate Karthus.

**Matchups you lose:**

* ~~Naruto~~ Ahri / The Fox can outpush you, has built in spellvamp higher than what you can normally get and has mobility out the ass. She's going to punish your mistakes. She can also get in your face, and given a fair amount of Ahri players lately love to rush Deathfire, she's going to blow you up. One of the few APs that Morde sincerely needs to fear.

* Cassiopeia / DOT heavy, DPS out the ass, can chase you easy. You're totally screwed against her, she's going to maintain keeping your shield down and staying on you with Q/E. Fortunately, Cassiopeias tend to have a tendency to oom themselves. You may want to try exploiting that. Failing that, call for a jungler gank. Also dodge her Q, it's her main lead-in to damage.


* Malzahar / DOT heavy, can instagib you at 6, can outpush you. Call for jungler, you're going to need it vs him. His silence is a huge pain for you and helps him push a lane harder with E. Don't get caught far from tower when he hits 6.

* Swain / He punishes melee pretty hard and has the DOT to kill your shield. Come 6, he's going to massacre you with his crazy sustain. Goddamn voodoo witchdoctor here.

* Annie / Despite being good/strong vs burst, Mordekaiser should be worried about Annie. She has way more than enough frontload damage + her combo usually has Ignite and her autos are the longest for an AP. She's a huge problem and needs to be watched carefully when her stun's up. If she's holding onto stun at 6, she's getting ready to drop the bear on you.

**Matches that are uncertain**:

* Kennen / I don't know about this one anymore. Kennen can autoattack you when you go in, but you can shield it easy with Q+E. I want to say Kennen has the edge, but Morde can outsustain + outpush.

* Diana / I want to say item changes have slanted this towards Diana. For a while Morde was the winner due to him being able to dump on most melee. However, item changes (mainly WOTA nerfs, Nashor changes, etc) and Diana's shield changes have changed the matchup's dynamics. If I had to pick, I'd say Diana should win if she's smart.

* Talon / He's melee, Morde punishes melee. Morde can also rush Seeker to nullify a lot of Talon's early game damage. I used to think Talon was auto-win against Morde, but when I originally wrote a Morde guide, Seeker's Armguard didn't exist. Things've changed and it's easier for a Morde to manage vs a Talon. Don't underestimate him though, he can still put out terrifying damage if he gets even a little ahead.

These matchups are by no means complete, I'm missing some unfortunately and can't remember who else Morde can expect to see typically.

**Tips, Tactics, Whatnot**:

* Your W is useful for farming at a distance, or to toss onto your initiator for teamfights. Don't forget to use it when you want to quickly clear a wave, or a wraith/wolf camp!

* Don't be scared to use your ult to save your ass if you're getting jumped. The heal + spellvamp off revolver/Spectral can turn a gank around, and you get a relatively short cooldown on it as well through items and blue potion.

* When you shove mid, look to farm wolves or wraiths to accumulate more gold. If your jungler's busy ganking other lanes, take wraiths! You can safely do it at level 4, 3 if you're experienced enough. But judge how long it takes you to clear wraiths, vs how hard mid is pushing. You want to find a balance between taking wolves/wraiths and farming mid. Best plan, I find, is shove mid hard -&gt; go take jungle camps. At level 4-5, it gives you enough time to get them before minions hit midway river.

To close it out, Mordekaiser has an unusual role in the game on top of his ability to have a high AOE damage output. Ultimate will make or break teamfights, and if you can snowball, you're quite hard to stop.

You're also possibly the only champion, other than Veigar, who profits off the *enemy* snowballing. Fed Vayne tearing through your team? No sweat. Pop ult, ignite, smack her and you've got yourself a fun time.

* **ALWAYS WARD WITH MORDEKAISER**. He's one of the most vulnerable-to-gank champions in the game. Whenever you b, buy two wards. If it delays an item, that's **perfectly fine**. You have to constantly ward as Morde due to his skills naturally pushing the hell out of a lane.

1374633685.0,30,self.summonerschool,1ixhw0,The mentality you need to have while ranking and the things you need to know to rank successfully.,JustZeus,37,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ixhw0/the_mentality_you_need_to_have_while_ranking_and/,"**Introduction**

Since I have a lot of people asking me about what they should do in rank I believe that this is the perfect opportunity to write a guide aimed at those who want to start rank, those who want to know what they need before they start rank(to use as a goal while playing), and general tips that they need to know when they are playing rank. 


First, I would like to introduce myself. My IGN is Zeus, I've been playing since season 1 and my current division is somewhere around D1. Both seasons I've had very bad placement matches due to making the same sort of mistakes. I have decided to make this guide because I would like to help people in not making the same mistakes I did. I will keep things as short and to the point as possible. This should be an easy read and is made so that you can read a few small sections at a time.

**Why?**

First you want to identify why you are playing rank. This will help a lot because it is a lot easier to know what to do when you are clear as to what you want. Do you simply want to play in a more serious environment? Is there a certain Elo that you want to be at? How much time are willing to spend to get what you want? 

**Who?**

Who are you as a player? What role are you most comfortable with? What champions are you best with?
It's good to know what you want to do. In knowing what you are comfortable with you should inform your team of this, but do not expect to get your first choice. There is no need to be upset if you do not get the role you wish for.

**Familiarize yourself with every role.**

It's good to specialize in one role, but you also need to know how to play other roles. Seeing as every role connects with each other; the more you learn about other roles, aside from the one you specialize in, the better you will become as a player.
You need to have at least two champions that you feel comfortable playing for every role. You don't want to be that guy that doesn't have a clue as to what to pick because he got forced into a role he has no clue about. 

**Team composition matters.**

Don't be stubborn and pick what you want; you need to learn to pick what your team needs. Understanding this is extremely important and requires you to have a good general knowledge of every champion. Ideally, you should played champion at least once. 

Championselect.net helps, but may not be 100% accurate.

**Taste the flavors.**

Flavor of the month (FOTM) champions are FOTM for a reason. Learn them, abuse them, and gain Elo. I know plenty of people who are now Diamond+ just because they abuse FOTM champs (Remember the sudden kat/eve mains?)

**There's no rush.**

Another thing that you need to know is that there is no rush. Your first ten matches can save you A LOT of time. One game is basically worth around ten games. So don't feel the need to get it ""over with;"" play when you feel you are at the top of your game. Perhaps win a few normal games first. A couple helpful tips are: always warm up with a pre-game and don't EVER play when you are upset/feeling down.

**Take breaks**

Don't be stubborn and continue to play when you are losing. You should play a few normals or just stop playing for a little bit. Chances are that if you continue to play you will continue to lose and it gets harder and harder every game.

**The Duo Rule**

Before I go into this, this rule is for those whose main purpose is to gain Elo. If you just want to have fun and don't really care about your Elo then this is obviously irrelevant to you. This is for the people who play to win and who duo for the sole purpose of winning and improving.

**These are a few rules to duo successfully:**

A: Don't get attached with your duo partner.

B: Never continue to duo when the outcome is negative(W/L wise)

C: Don't duo with people you aren't comfortable with.

D: Be honest. Be clear. Be realistic.

A: Don't be get attached with your duo partner. Do things objectively and don't overly rely on your duo partner. Your goal is to win and improve. You shouldn't just rely on your partner hoping for a free Elo (Unless that's your goal.)

B: Don't continue to play with each other if you keep losing. I normally stop playing with someone if I go past -2. 

C &amp; D: Don't duo if you can't be honest with them. Be clear as to what they need to do and what you expect them to do. Be realistic; if they are doing something wrong, you need to be comfortable enough to let them know.

**Be constructive.**

* Examples of things not to say:
* Stop feeding!
* Wdf are you doing?
* Why would you do that?
* I have no idea what you're doing.
* That was probably the worst play I have ever witness.


**Examples of things you should be saying:**

* You might want to buy wards since you are getting ganked quite a bit.
* I hear Darius doesn't do that well against Jayce so you should play safe until the jungler helps you.
* It's not that big of a deal that you're behind. Just focus on farming so that we can take it to late game.
* You might want to buy some armor because they have 3 ADs on their team.


**Be positive.**

You should not rage or have negative thoughts, you don't gain anything from being an asshole. Ex: People don't play better when you say ""GG"" after every death. 

**Get objectives.**

You should always be doing something. For example: always be farming, always be prepared for dragon/baron, and always get your appropriate buffs(BLUE FOR MID, RED FOR ADC.) Make sure you take down towers. You should light up the map if you're playing support and let the enemy team experience the darkness when you have oracles. Most importantly never sit around and wait for the enemy team to do something. 

**Take charge.**

Communicate with your team. Make calls, learn to lead people without offending them, and be the hero that your team needs. 

Note: There is a difference between leading your team and just being a bossy teammate. ",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1ixhw0,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ixhw0/the_mentality_you_need_to_have_while_ranking_and/,

Now back to the original subject, here is some information about the various games and some requirements for casting:

**Aram Games** - Anyone can join them.

**Novice Game** - Anyone ranging from Bronze V to Bronze I can join, you'll have a Platinum or Diamond support player in your team that will help you make calls and tells you what you can improve on.

**Intermediate Game** - Anyone from Silver V to Gold I can join, Bronze I can be considered if there aren't enough players. Here every player is around your skill level, you'll experience teamwork as you will be talking on either TeamSpeak or Mumble and you will have fun playing.

**Advanced Game** - These games are for those in between Platinum V and Diamond I, and for those who dare play against them, feel like you can beat a diamond player with your insane Jax plays? Go ahead and try.

**Shout casting** - Have you ever wanted to try shout casting? Maybe you've done it before and liked it, or if you are completely new you can try here, if you have never shout casted before, either Color Commentary or Play-by-Play you will cast either one Aram game or one Novice game, just for you to get hang of the basics and to get the chance to do it with someone who has done it before.

**Requirements Play-by-Play** - We prefer that you are able to speak fast and fluently, also that you have some knowledge about the game beforehand, as long as you can speak fast and fluently you are good to go.

**Requirements Color Commentary** - Here we require that you have a better knowledge of the game, since you will be talking about what a champion can do, how their play style is, why they are building a certain item, you are also going to have to break down team fights and explain them after the fight has ended and explain what actually happened, who hit who, who died first, which summoner spells where used, etc. 

**Fine print** - For you to participate in these kind of games you must first accept the fact that the ENTIRE event will be streamed and shout casted, you can later watch the VOD on the stream video page where they will be posted after the event is done. 
We will never aim to make profit by doing this and this is driven entirely by us. Since this is a community driven event there will be times where it won't be happening due to lack of applicants or lack of Streamer or Shout casters.

Someone asked me how I played her and built her, so I figured I'd put it on here as well, seeing as there aren't many viable guides for her anymore. 
(this isn't a full guide, just a few build options and tips)

""Depends on the situation, she can be incredibly powerful if going full ap with lich bane, or you can go full life-steal items with a Iceborne, but generally you'll want to go tri-force and then get some ad, although Rageblade(with it's recent buffs) and Gunblade are very powerful with the tri-force build if you add some attack speed like botrk or new wit's end. She does massive AP damage whether you build any ap or not, her q does 8% of their max hp in magic damage at level 1 so it's pretty powerful, not to mention spammable. Her w gives a ridonculous 25% speed boost with a low cooldown. I usually go 21/9/0 going down AD with armpen and AP with mpen but focusing on AD path. You can use whatever Runes you'd like but I use hybrid marks, AD quints for last-hitting, flat armour yellows and scaling magic resist blues. Remember to use ignite on the target of your ultimate, it increases the true by 30%, it's devastating.""

After this, I was asked why you should build an Iceborne Gauntlet with Lifesteal items since it doesn't boost attack damage or attack speed, therefor not helping with Lifesteal, what's the correlation? Well...

""It doesn't lifesteal or give ad/attack speed, but her q procs the IBG passive and slows them, allowing you to stick until your e is off cooldown and you can push them into a wall. Also, about building her tanky, with her passive, they have to do 10% of your current health for it to do anything, so if you build her too tanky it's useless, that's why lifesteal with only 1 armour item (IBG) is so good. You can tear apart ad carries and get out with no damage taken if you use your ult. Which by then your team will have initiated and hopefully they've forgotten about poor old poppy.
Also she's VERY good in 3's played top. AP build with blackfire torch shreds virtually anyone. Also, keep in mind that her e works just like Vayne's condemn, but with a little less push-back range. Since it's safer to use, you might want to practice with vayne if you haven't already.""

I'm not the best, but I feel that I'm better than bronze (was Silver S2). Here's a few tips that aren't often mentioned, but are working well for me.

1) Watch streams. WingsOfDeathx is fantastic, and is doing a toplane A-Z marathon. You'll learn a LOT about champs, matchups, and how to make plays. Phreak is fun to watch, though most of the times I've watched him have been pretty big fails (like Teemo games). Regardless, watching the pros play will give you strategies you didn't think of before. 

2) Practice. Never underestimate the power of ARAM, Normals, Co-op vs AI and Custom. Want to learn a new champ? do a custom 5 with 9 bots and pick the new champ. Don't do it in solo queue, for the love of god. practice your abilities, wall hops, etc. go nuts. have fun with it. Then, take it to co-op, then to normals before you go ranked with that champ. You'll still get IP, and won't tank your ranked stats.

3) read. Wikis, forums, here. And absorb. Learn what abilities do, and learn to do math on the fly based on the ability descriptions. League is getting difficult now with over 100 champs, but you see on average around 20. there shouldn't be any surprise from any of those 20.

4) when you lose a ranked match, i advise against hopping back into ranked queue. Step back, play an aram or normals to get yourself in a better mood.

These steps have helped pull me out of bronze v, and i'm already climbing through IV. GLHF!",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_1g4lpc,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1g4lpc/a_few_tips_for_my_low_elo_brothers/,
1370470342.0,28,self.summonerschool,1fr1nd,I have a serious problem with Tryndamere,scrappyisachamp,36,8,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fr1nd/i_have_a_serious_problem_with_tryndamere/,"I just finished my placement games 4/6 and got placed in Bronze II. Last night, I was 4/4 and feeling pretty good about it. This is, until I played my final two games today and lost both of them. In these two games, the enemy team had a Tryndamere.

In my mind, I blame these losses on the late game strength of Tryndamere. Both of these games we had a nice lead beginning-mid game. We were leading in kills, turrets, objectives etc.

Late game is where the tides turned. We could just not do any damage to Tryndamere whatsoever, I would estimate he had around 3k health, not sure what his armor and mr were, and as an ad carry he could just spin through my entire team and three shot me with basic attacks. I know hard CC is the way to go against him, but no amount of TF yellow cards, Thresh flays, pulls, Boxes, Varus ults, Singed flips, or Nocturne fears could stop him from wrecking our entire team.

And even the times we could manage to kill him, Undying Rage would keep him alive love enough to get multiple kills, and he also had a guardian angel. If we wanted to kill, him we had to focus him enough to kill him three times over.

In my eyes, Tryndamere is a manaless tank with enough damage, lifesteal, attack speed, health, and resistances to withstand damage from an entire team whilst killing the carry in four autoattacks. Even if you DO manage to kill him, he can live on invulnerable for another FIVE seconds, and if you kill him after that he has GA to save him still. You either focus him to take him down three times over, giving his team enough time to kill, or forget about him and let him kill all of you. His lifesteal and AS gives him incredible sustain, not to mention he has a heal. He also has a spin which he can flawlessly engage, disengage, and escape with.

I just don't know what to do. I ended up 12/5/19 that game, but it seemed Tryndamere was just too strong to do anything about.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1370470787.0,,default,True,t3_1fr1nd,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fr1nd/i_have_a_serious_problem_with_tryndamere/,

The problem with this is that this also means they assume they know the best course of action while the rest can not see it. These players have made such silly suggestion as ""Everyone buy an oracle to counter X champion,"" which for obvious reasons is a mistake.

Now thinking you know whats best while everyone else is idiots is nothing new, but to see it be brought about ***during*** a game is. Normally its easy to judge who is competent just by champion selection and way in which they state a preferred role. But when a player gets say maybe 15/20 of the teams kills they assume this makes them more experienced/suited for play calling. Sadly this comes mainly from the fact they are ill experienced and can not notice the little things everyone else does that put them in such a position.

I guess what I am getting at is just pay attention to the little things, if you are not normally inclined to make play calls don't. You may very will know better but if you are in a pinch and something else ***needs*** to be done, only suggest it if you have the time to explain it.

Hi all, I'm primarily a jungler/support/AD player but yesterday while playing Ryze on the new Twisted Treeline I realized that mechanically chaining your spells is not simply about QWQEQRQ... you need to get autoattacks in there and in particular early game you can Qrightclick or Qauto nearly at the same time and increase your harrass. latter on if you have a move speed advantage QWautoQEautoQRautoQ or maybe QWEautoQ when you want the most burst in a small timeframe. 


tldr - don't just harass with spells or autoattack, they can be chained together for more efficient harassment.i.e. Qrightclick nearly at the same time.


Edit 2 (thanks to Wynden127) - Remember that AA comes first, because spells will interrupt the AA timer, but not vice versa

To provide some detail, I haev lost 6 games and won 4 and I got assigned ELO of 1110. I feel that this is somewhat below my ability likely due to some bad luck in the lost games (a couple of disconnects, some troll players etc.). Not saying I lost all 6 games by bad luck only, but luck was definitely a factor in about half of them. On to observations.

* There is much less bitching and trolling and general nastiness than I expected. In fact, I found that on average people were more civil than in normal blind pick games. So if you are not playing ranked just because you are scared of raging trolls, you really shouldn't be. Of course if you are going 3-25 in kills and you lost your first inhibitor at 15 minute mark, tempers do flare, but they do so in normals as well.

* After the normals, it is refreshing to play with people who genuinely want to win and are prepared to work as a team to get there. Out of 10 games I only had 1 where someone was obviously feeding on purpose (or maybe someone had a 3-year old cousin play on his account, who knows). The rest of the game, whether won or lost, people were making a genuine effort to win. After all the ""it is 0-3, surrender at 20 I am going AFK"" in blind normals, this attitude feels nice.

* Chances are, I will not be playing many ranked games. I am curious as to what my ELO will be after a 100-200 games and will probably find out eventually, but I intend to mostly play normal blind picks, same as I did in the past. The two main reasons being, that draft-pick games seem to take much longer to setup, especially with all the dodgers and that you rarely get to play the champion and/or role that you actually want. In blind normals people are mostly OK with you taking any champion into any lane, but in ranked everyone expects you to follow the meta and take whatever role you get in the picks. I am lucky in a way, since I enjoy playing jungle and a lot of people seem to dislike jungling, so I got to jungle in 8 out of 10 games, but in almost every game there is some guy being frustrated out of his mind because he got to play support and I honestly don't want to be that guy.

One of my pet peeves is people asking ""who should I pick"". I have two reasons for disliking this sentence being used, which I'll explain below:

**1. There is no be all to end all champion for each role.**
Each role has champions which excel, which do well, and those that do not do so well. This applies to such threads, because people expect to be given a champion on a silver platter,  which is completely not possible. Every champion has strengths and weaknesses (which are forever changing due to nerfs, buffs and changes in flavors of the month), every champion has a counter, and counters others (the number can however vary). Simple right? Each champion is different, so asking for a single champion 

**2. Everyone has their own unique style of playing.**
While many people play similar to others, they are never the same. Hence asking others what champion will suit YOU in a game where YOUR gameplay style rules how well you perform with that champion, is redundant. For example, some people excel at AP champions, others at bruisers. Asking who you should use is like saying ""which colour is best?""..... there are millions of shades of different colours, just like there are millions of different unique players in LoL. 

**Solution to this annoying problem is simple. Play the champions that are mainstream for the role you wish to learn!!!!!**
If you try everything, you will know what works for you. Read guides, watch streams, ask for tips on SPECIFIC champions, but dont ask ""what should I pick"" because it's a wild goose chase on our part, as well as yours.

They would then create groups and then play/observe matches together with one of the coaches. I think that would work even better in LoL since its inherently a team game so lends itself to working with groups. 

We could for example create a match with 1 coach and 4 students on each side. Play it out with the coach trying to call the shots then have everyone watch a LoL replay of it together to look at what was done well and what mistakes were made and analyse why.

Not much is required - having a teamspeak/ventrillo/mumble server would be helpful - but even skype could work in the interrim. I'm happy to get involved in organising this for EUW at least.

I'm in Bronze 5. I placed B4 but after being promoted and demoted a couple times, I'm back here. I got into champ select and everything was great.

As soon as we get into lane, Shen dies from an ambush and I get low. I lifesteal as I try to cs without dying. Shen dies once more, but I get a kill. The enemy team starts throwing and I am getting fed. At the beginning of the game, we weren't sure how it would turn out but we pulled through and communicated well. I ended up 15/2/xx at the end and my whole team did well.

Very engage-y, jump in there type of junglers.

Recently, they asked me to try out Nasus (I've never played Nasus before). I played him one game, and while he didn't seem to hard *mechanically* (compared with someone like Elise), I really didn't know what I was doing.

I maxed R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W, building basically the same as I do on everyone else (I went Ancient Golem into Ninja Tabi into Locket). Is that right?

What about how to gank? Without the gap closer, I found myself just....running at people. I'd throw down a wither, but by the time I was in range to cast it, they were already running away and I couldn't do more than get a single Q off on them.

What do I do during team fights? I just ulted, wither'd their ADC, threw down my E, and then ran around AA'ing people, q-ing whenever I could. Is that the right way to do it?

Also, is there a good way to judge how I'm doing on q-stacks, as a jungler? Some chart, so I can see ""oh, meteos has 300 q stacks at this point in the game, I only have 90, I suck"" or something? I definitely wasn't perfect with it, but I had no idea how far behind I really was.

Speaking of Q stacks, how big of a priority do you put on them? Let's say I'm level 7 or 8, no pressure on my lanes, and I'm about to do wolves. Should I be planning to Q all three wolves? It will take some extra time on my clear, but is it worth it? Or should I just Q what I can, clear asap, and move on?

I just felt kind of useless, especially after playing someone with such huge teamfight presence like Zac. How can I be a better Nasus?

Any other generic tips would be wonderful :)

##**the mid to late game**

We are around the 15:00-20:00 mark, by now you should have gotten a few kills on your lane or on another from ganks, obtained one or more objectives(1 or 2 towers, dragons). You have (presumably) given your team an early game lead and it is now time to capitalize on it and carry your side to victory. How do you achieve this?

**Step up and take the lead**

To minimize the risk of your teammates committing big mistakes, tell them what they should be doing. If you have been dominating the game, they will willingly listen to you and you can naturally ""boss"" them around. If you have lost lane or not been a big impact on the game(this happens to everyone) do **not** be authoritative about it. ""Hey guys (I can't handle my lane anymore), let's group and push together"".

(low elo) Solo queue players have a tendency to be very static on lanes, they will almost always head back to it after a death or base recall. This is the mistake you are looking to exploit. Look at the minimap: are any outer towers still standing? These are your first objectives. **Coordinate with your jungler** (""hey junglerX, come gank Y with me"") and 3v1 or 4v2 gank a lane. This will give you both a higher gank success rate AND more pushing power. When taking down a tower **analyze the situation**, can you afford to keep pushing? Where is the rest of the enemy team? Do we need to go back in order to defend a more important objective? **Before the tower is dead** either spam ping the next tower, or spam ping back. If you make a bad call (and you will), suck it up, accept the criticism, but most importantly try to identify why it was a mistake and what you failed to see. This will help your map awareness. **Repeat this process** until you have taken all outer towers(or managed to push an inib if the situation called for it) or the enemy team has reacted to your craftiness and started grouping as well. It is now time to teamfight.

Unfortunately regarding teamfights i can't help you much, the outcome of these are largely based on your mechanical skills and reactive decision making which can almost only be acquired through experience. I can't possibly cover every teamcomp and champions roles. I'll say this though: in a proper teamfight **Tanks and bruisers should always be dying first**. This doesn't mean that they are your primary targets, it means that if you position correctly and make no mistakes(and the enemy does the same) then the only players taking any real damage are the ones on the tankline.

Nonetheless there are a few things that you can think about before a 5v5 breaks out. The most important being to **identify the biggest threats on both teams**. Once you have collected this information you should create a game plan for yourself with one idea in mind: protect the **good** carries on your team and always keep an eye on the carries in the enemy team. This is a very difficult skill to master and im fairly certain any high elo player will tell you that they get lost or tunnelvision in teamfights every now and then. Every second of a team fight you need to make sure that your carries are safe and in position to deal damage AND the opponent's carries have not committed a mistake. What if you are the only one fed on your team? Then you are the carry and need to act accordingly: **use your team as bait**. Let the opponent tunnel vision on your squishy teammates and then target their carries. Enter the teamfight late if you must and cleanup the initial dmg done by your team. Do **not** commit to killing their adc as a fed bruiser if it means a 1v1 trade, your team needs you more than your enemy needs their adc.

Hopefully the enemy carries have made a mistake and you have capitalized on it. You have turned the tide in your team's favor and more friends than foes are still standing. Your first reaction after each teamfight is to **look for objectives that can be taken** (don't farm, don't chase). My objectives preference: Nexus &gt; Inib &gt; nashor &gt; inib tower &gt; dragon &gt; outer tower &gt; buffs but you might not see it this way. Again you are the leader and need to spam ping your choice, however if they decide for an objective on their own, **consider following them**. This is the late game where mistakes are costly - being split is often worse than taking the wrong objective.

Rinse an repeat until you have successfully pushed an inib. Continue to try catching the enemy unaware and if that doesn't work, once you have an inib, head to the towers(still guiding your team) furthest away from it and start taking them down patiently - wait for your super-creep wave to push and for an enemy to defend and force them to make a mistake: either defend 4v5 or let you have objectives for free. Once you have 2 inibs it is just a matter of convincing your team to group and not give the game away. Victory.


##**Misc tips**

**timing objectives**

First buffs respawn by 7:10. If you or your jungler have taken an early lead coordinate with your jungler around 6:00 to counter the first respawn. On the contrary if you have fallen behind make sure you buy wards so they can't pick you off as you attempt to catch up. Try to **time all drags/nash**. If you don't think about it when you first get the objective just look at the chat and use the timestamp in order to find out when they respawn. Coordinate your team at least 1 minute before they spawn, you don't need that jungler smiting a wolf just because you didn't mention it sooner.


**creep wave management**

When to push, when to last hit, and when to not touch creeps? This section is targetted at lane  players who have just scored a kill(with or without jungler) or junglers who approach an empty lane.

The 3 factors you must take into account are:

1. The state of the lane: Is it pushing to your tower? Is it pushing to to the enemy tower? At what rate? Or is it even?

2. The state of the lane that would most benefit the laner when you get back. Are you capable of zoning the enemy? best scenario is a pushing lane right in front of your tower so you can freeze it.
3. Your ability to push a lane. If you are a slow pusher you will give time to the opponent to get back from his death and 1) give him full xp 2) give him security under tower 3) put yourself/your laner at risk because his lane is now pushed and weak to ganks. **This is a very big mistake and can completely negate a kill obtained 1v1**

Before I go any further I want to mention something important: **Last hitting an even lane pushes it**. You know those times where the laner spam pings a jungler to not touch a lane and they wisely retort ""but i'm only last hitting, i'm not pushing"". **WRONG**. Last hitting an even lane will push it towards your enemy who now has the ability to freeze it in front of his tower and if the 2 laners are evenly matched this will be a very big advantage to him. It will also create a gap in both gold and xp between the two laners. You should amost never do it! ""But if i'm not getting it then no one will"". True, but you could also farm your jungle or be ganking another lane for an even bigger gold income without hindering that lane.

Now that you have this in mind, what should you do after a kill?

The most obvious scenario: Your creeps are pushing. **always shove it into the enemy tower**. This does 3 things: denies enemy gold and xp, resets the lane and gives you time to buy and get back without missing the next creepwave.

The less obvious scenario: The enemy creeps are pushing. You have 3 options here:

1. You are capable of handling your opponent when he gets back without buying any extra items(aka you have a big lead) - keep last hitting and freeze the lane.

2. You are not capable of handling the opponent who will have have bought more items than you:

    1. if you(and your jungler) have the pushing power - shove it into the enemy tower.

    2. If you cannot push it, then freeze it and go b asap. This will enable you to buy items at the same time as the opponent and come back and zone him with a lane frozen in front of your tower.

How to freeze a lane? Simply keep more enemy creeps alive after each wave. The soft spot is something close to 2-3 ranged creeps. That way the enemy creeps will kill yours faster and you(the player) will dictate how fast the creepwave should die.

##**Jungler specific information**

After consideration this will probably be included in a seperate post starting back at lvl 1, since it is so much different than laning. Or maybe editted in later, we'll see

##**Final notes**

For starters I'll say that the LoL elo system works, **If you are stuck in a league after 200 games, that is your true elo** (statistically speaking there may be a very miniscule amount of players for whom this isn't true, but it has less to do with how hard it is to carry your teammates, and more to do with how unlucky you have been in your matchmaking). **If you cannot reach that next league then you are simply not good enough for it**. In fact the current system is quite forgiving in this respect: Lose streaks happen, and so do win streaks. If you reach the next league(from which you can't fall anymore) at the height of a winstreak you do not actually deserve it(even though you might think so). It's time to start improving; the best way to do this is to be **self-critical** at all times. It also helps to identify good plays(yours or not); even during my bronze session I found myself thinking ""wow great play"" or ""holy shit that was good"" about others, both teammates and opponents.

A followup to this is: **You cannot win every game**. In fact you cannot even win a high percentage of your games unless you belong in a much higher league. If you start in bronze as a silver player, you should most likely be winning 51-60% of your games: 9 out of 20 games will be a loss. **Do not let losses affect your game.**

Why did I not talk about AFKs and such? Simply because this post is directed at every game in which **you** are the deciding factor. You will lose every game where there are 4 afks on your team and you will win every game where there are 4 afks on the enemy team. Some games you simply cannot win, but for every other one you must make all the correct plays to ensure the balance tips in your favor. How do you do this? You make sure that you + your team are stronger than your opposing team, it is not just a matter of you vs your lane opponent. League is a team game, your individual skill is meaningless if you cannot cooperate.

Finally I'd like to state that there is a lot of information in these posts, whether I stated it explicitly or not, and despite the messages I have received, I can assure you that if you are in bronze, silver or gold you probably do not know it all, and you **certainly** do not apply it all. I also don't believe that you are capable of incorporating it all after a single read and a few games; systematically thinking about the next moves takes practice and most of all familiarity with the champion you are playing. Tactical skills go hand in hand with mechanical skills. So i suppose my ultimate tip would be to master a few champions and include bit by bit these notions into your arsenal of tactics.

**TLDR:** crush your lane(jungle) opponent, feed your other lanes with ganks, act like a leader and win. free elo**",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1366409984.0,,,True,t3_1cmj7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1cmj7b/elo_hell_binge_part_2or_rehashing_the_stuff_youve/,

1364992363.0,27,self.summonerschool,1bl0ct,[Theory]What defines an ADC?,MedalsNScars,38,11,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1bl0ct/theorywhat_defines_an_adc/,"Almost every ADC has different features to their kit. There are burst ADCs, poke ADCs, passive ADCs, ADCs with escape and without, and so on.

The two things all ADCs have in common, though, is strong sustained DPS and a decent range.

In League of Legends there are currently 14 or 15 legitimate, consistant ADC champions (in my opinion):

Caitlyn, Ashe, Varus, Miss Fortune, Ezreal, Draven, Corki, Tristana, Twitch, Vayne, Quinn, Graves, Sivir, Kog'Maw, and I suppose you could include Urgot.

But there are tons of ranged characters(52, if you count Jayce and Kayle.) Why aren't more of them played as ADCs?

So I took a look at the other 37 ranged champions' base stats and kits and noticed a few champions that could I think could be played as ADCs but rarely ever are, and I'd like to see what you guys think about my thoughts:

|Common ADC|Range|Level 6 DPS (AA and passives only, no items)|Level 18 DPS(same)|Level 18 DPS(BT, IE, PD, Greaves, LW)|Level 18 DPS(BT, IE, Shiv, Greaves, BC)|Base AS|Level 18 AS|

|Twitch*1|550|54.7~78.7|112.5~150.5|1283.2~1331.2|1215.1~1263.1|.679|1.092|
|Vayne*2|550|59.4|131.7|1289.0|1224.9|.658|1.025|
|Quinn|525|52.3|106.3|1239.9|1179.1|.668|1.042|
|Graves|525|51.1|101.6|1164.3|1105.7|.625|.951|

|Urgot|425|52.6|110.6|1222.4|1159.5|.644|.980|

*1: Twitch's AA DPS is significantly higher than what I listed here at both levels 6 and 18, probably higher than anyone else on this table, but I was unsure of how to calculate his passive in as his DPS changes with every autoattack until 6.

EDIT: Now shows minimum-maximum DPS range (0 to 6 stacks)

*2: Doesn't account for Silver Bolt's %HP damage, does count flat (I used level 1 Bolts for level 6 DPS), so Vayne will have the highest AA DPS on this chart by an even larger margin if that is accounted for.

|Potential ADC|Range|Level 6 DPS|Level 18 DPS|Level 18 DPS(PD, LW set)|Level 18 DPS(BC, Shiv set)|Base AS|Level 18 AS|

|Jayce|500|52.4|111.0|1243.1|1180.1|.658|1.013|
|Thresh|475|39.22|63.13|971.0|922.8|.625|.738|

EDIT: Treated Orianna's DPS same as Twitch's (her passive damage per hit increases on each hit by 20%, up to twice.)

Quick rundown on my reasoning for each:

**Kennen**: Average ADC range, high sustained DPS, very high base AS (scales well with AS items), decent escape skill, good poke, has a stun, manaless. Personally, I think he would make a very strong ADC, biggest weakness is poke doesn't scale with AD.

**Ziggs**: Above average ADC range, decent sustained DPS, breaks towers quickly, strong base damage on skills, has a slow and a displace.

**TF**: Slightly below average range, above average sustained DPS when accounting for his E. Strong map presence. Incredibly mana efficient. Has stun.

**Sona**: Average ADC range, strong poke with Q, and very solid DPS with Q aura up. Also, that ult. Pretty weak case here, but it certainly *could* be done. Might get the element of surprise too.

**Lulu**: Her passive actually makes her hit like a truck, and she has tons of utility. Definitely better as a support though, where her passive will do more damage coming from a teammate with higher AS.

**Orianna**: Again, below average range for an ADC, but brings a ton of damage from her passive as you build AS (higher than any standard ADC without building any.) Her ult is pretty awesome too. She's probably better suited as a mid-laner, but I think it could be done.


**Nidalee**: Below average range, above average base AS, and a self-AS buff that comes packaged with a heal. I could see her being a terror if you started BT-&gt;IE and ignored AS until mid-late game, with her armor debuff on human W and the absurd finishing damage on animal Q. That said she's be super squishy and her range isn't great, so you'd definitely have to know what you're doing.

**Teemo**: His single-target sustained DPS is just absurd with his toxic darts and naturally high AS. Unfortunately his range is only 500 and he's pretty squishy, so he really isn't going to beat anyone in bot lane. He'll beat just about any other ADC in a duel though, with his blind.

**Jayce**: Very similar stats to your standard ADCs, but he brings a paltry 500 range to the table, making him very weak at ADC.

**Thresh**: He seems pretty horrible as an ADC, but his AA damage scales directly with souls and I have no experience with how many souls you'd get at what point as him, so for all I know his sustained DPS could be pretty good. Probably not good enough to overcome his 475 range, though, so I'm just going to pretend I didn't even put him on this list.
___
There's a few other champs whose base stats let you feel like they could be played as a subpar ADC, but they're just better in other roles. They are:

Annie (625 Range and a Armor/MR buff and stun, but that AS...)

Anivia (600 Range, but again, that AS.)

Zilean (600 Range, not *horrible* AS, but nothing I'd use for sustained DPS. His ult is kinda cool I guess.)

Nami (550 Range, actually decent DPS of 98 at level 18, but nothing to write home about, especially when you consider that she has no trading abilities.)

Ahri (550 Range, charm, DPS of 94 at 18, .668 base AS, solid escape. If I'd consider any of these it'd be her, but she's definitely pretty lackluster as an ADC)

Zyra (575 Range, snare, AoE stun ult, she brings a lot of utility to the table, but all her casting animations take away from the little sustained DPS she has. Probably better pretty much anywhere else.)

Then every other ranged character would be abysmally bad at ADC from what I see in their stats.

Let me know if I made any mistakes in my tables, and let me know what you think about the guys I listed (I know TF and Kennen have been played as ADCs but I wouldn't consider them ADCs right now.)

So I'm level 24ish, and I main nocturne jungle. Ever since subscribing to this subreddit, my game has gotten a lot better (even the mentality that YOU have to carry if you want to win, because that's how people get plat, etc. has helped a ton.) But when there's a 2v1 top, I'm not sure how to handle it. In my experience, it's impossible to gank 2v1 top, because they will both almost always have full health, be tanky, my top will be harassed, and if I come in, there will be no advantage on our side, it would just be a normal 2v2 fight (with a slight disadvantage since my top is usually half health). I therefore try to focus on mid/bot whenever there's a 2v1 top and just shut them down. Most of the time this works (sometimes it doesn't, but what can you do), but regardless, I'm always faced with the endless stream of ""OMG JUNGLE NO GANKS GG TOP."" 

Am I doing the wrong thing here? I always figured 2v1 top was an advantage for the top laner as they outlevel them. Should I camp top when this happens and act as an almost laner, or should I stick to my strategy of trying to steamroll bot/mid?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone! I saw some good tips (snowball mid and get a 3v2 gank, coordinate right when you both hit level 2 and they're still level 1, or the same thing at level 6, etc...) I'll try them all out and try to apply the right strategy accordingly :)",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1361814584.0,,,True,t3_196zxq,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/196zxq/dealing_with_2v1_top_as_a_jungler/,

A fun way to get stronger at late game.,vGoNebulous,29,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/15quix/how_to_help_you_and_your_friends_to_stay_as_a/,"We all have been in those situations where laning phase went even, or even you won, and the scores are about the same on the whole team. Then, as soon as laning ends, people stay in their lanes while the other team groups and just pushes towers. Then, you ask for your team mates to group too… and they don’t. You’re asking them over Skype, Vent, Raidcall, or whatever program you use, and they still don’t come. Those 6 minions in bot lane were so important that both mid towers die to their push. You now have little map control, they can freely push top or bot, dragon, baron, whatever they want. How do you get the idea into your friends heads that you want to stay as 5 and that you win by making smart team fights and not getting caught out.

There is TL;DR near bottom if you don’t want to read.

I have a suggestion.

Pick an AOE team comp, and make it clear to your team mates that this “Wombo Combo” will win any team fight if done properly, but it WON’T work if you aren’t 5. What person will not want to totally dominate a team fight and easily push to victory or baron? These comps are also visually appealing, make you feel really good, and make everyone feel like they had a big part in the fight.

I bring this up because sometimes your friends (or you) just don’t know when to group, when to roam as a team, and when to split up. Champions like Nidalee, Nocturne, Shen and others are great split pushers, but give that player the mindset that they either can’t team fight, or are stronger not. Even if subliminal, it happens to the best of us.

Example: Last night, my friends and I did one of these comps because we really wanted to win. My friends, who generally like to just choose fun champs without any regard to team comp were on board with the idea and we came up with this team before even clicking the “Play” button.


Mid Laner: Orianna

Top Laner: Wukong

Jungler: Malphite

AD Carry: Miss Fortune

Support: Lulu


Our idea was this, and this was our set in stone (hue, malphite pun) plan for team fights.

Orianna puts ball on Malphite with Command:Protect

Malphite Ults in when a good opportunity comes up

Orianna ults to keep all 5 in group

Lulu ults Malphite to knock them up again, making sure to stagger the CC as much as possible (not overlap)

Wukong Nimbus Strike’s in then ults, knocking them all up again and shredding armor.

Miss Fortune sets herself up for her ult and then ults as or soon after, Malphite goes in to guarantee full ult channel.

Everyone was excited to make this happen, and went to their lanes with excitement for team fights. They pushed lanes, took towers, and did pretty well in lane (one lane went even, one won hard, and one lost) and Malphite (me) in the jungle helped those who had trouble.


As soon as team fight time started (laning phase was over) we grouped and pushed. Wukong left to farm and Lulu backed to buy something, and then while they were gone Malphite, Orianna, and Miss Fortune got brutally murdered when they were engaged on.


After seeing this, Wukong, Lulu, and everyone else realized they had to stay as 5 almost always to make this happen. And, without going into too much detail, we wiffed a couple attempts (missed malph ult, MF got killed before ult, no ball on malph or whatever) and then finally, when we were posturing under one of their towers, trying to bait their engage, I saw the perfect Malph ult opportunity, already had the ball on me because we were preparing for a fight, and went in.


It was glorious, within 5 seconds the entire enemy team was dead, most of us had almost no damage done to us (aside from the pro-fight poking) and we went on to just win the game there. 


What I noticed our team did differently from normal games was the following:

Stayed as a team almost the entire post-laning phase

really had a solid plan for how to do team fights

knew what could stop us and avoided it

Generally just played better as a team

So, this was a really long post to say the following TL;DR


TL;DR: If you and your friends are having a hard time staying as a team and not getting caught out, do a couple AOE team comp games. It really helps keep everyone in sync, together, and all over stronger than your opponents.


Since I feel like making this post frikken huge, here’s the champs with good AOE ults for your “Wombo Combo” and where they can be played.

Amumu - Jungle

Anivia - Mid

Annie - Mid

Brand - Mid

Draven - AD Carry

Evelynn - Mid/Jungle

Ezreal - AD Carry

Fiddlesticks - Mid/Jungle

Galio - Mid

Graves - AD Carry (Not so much)

Jarvan IV - Jungle/Top

Karthus - Mid

Kennen - Mid/Top

Lulu - Support/Mid

Malphite - Jungle/Top

Miss Fortune - AD Carry

Maokai - Jungle (Special with Vladimir)

Orianna - Mid

Pantheon - Top/Mid (Really hard to pull off)

Ryze - Mid

Sejuani - Jungle

Sona - Support

Twitch - AD Carry

Viktor - Mid

Vladimir - Mid/Top (Special with Maokai)

Wukong - Top

Xerath - Mid

Ziggs - Mid

Zyra - Mid/Support

But Chris, why no Hecarim or Gragas? Their ults push people away from the fight when you want to keep them together.

Remember that all the champs listed above have strong AOE ults, but may not all go well together. Be smart when planning out your team, and I hope to god I don’t see any of you out there, I really like being alive and winning games.

That way if you press W then V fast you'll get an insta-buff. No more bloodboiling minions!

This also makes teamfights a little easier since you dont accidentally bloodboil someone other than the AD.

Short (kind of) introduction - My IGN is Tendresse, and I've been playing this game for almost 2 years now. While I was a hopeless case at first, I progressively improved and am now sitting comfortably in the middle grounds of gold Elo which may not make me a fomidable player, it does show that I have a reasonable knowledge about this game. 

I've always been aware of the massive amount of information and help available to help newer players pick up this excellent game, but something was always bugging me : how spread out it was. So a few months back, I decided to start a short but efficient guide about the basics of this game. At first, it was nothing but a .txt document posted as a single post on the forums of a small gaming community I'm part of. But then I started adding more and more content, and finally decided to port it to solomid.net's guides' section to make use of the visibility and the formatting/images. Although the reactions were overwhelmingly positive, I don't feel it has yet the visibility it deserves. 

I'm asking you fellow players, what do you think of the guide? Would you think the community would greatly benefit from this work being shared around? Am I just biased by the amount of time I've put into it, or does this document really stands out from the others? If it doesn't, what do you think is missing for it to be the go-to League of Legends ""bible""? 

tl;dr - Made guide for new players, positive but small pool of reviews, humbly asking for input/comments/suggestions on how to improve it

Here is the guide : http://www.solomid.net/guides.php?g=21513

PS : I'm aware this seems like an ""upvote my ____ =) XD"" request. It's not. While I do appreciate every upvote given to this work, my objective is to make the best available guide in order to efficiently help out the most possible players, not to run my own Justin Bieber facebook page.

And with that, heeeeeere we go~.

**QUESTION: WHAT IS SNS?**

Answer: SNS (previously Sunday Night Scrims, now Saturday Night Scrims) is a weekly event aimed at improving player skill while providing a platform for their performance to be broadcast to the general public. We have several games ranging in skill level from zero skill required to expert level that are played with each broadcast. The intent is to allow players (and viewers) to see how LoL is played at different Elo ranges/experience levels while providing competent feedback and commentary.  

**QUESTION: WHEN DOES THE BROADCAST START?**

Answer: The first game will start at approximately 1pm PST (4pm EST), with the possibility of a pre-game show as well.

**QUESTION: DOES THAT MEAN THIS TAKES PLACE ON THE NORTH AMERICAN SERVER ONLY?**

Answer: SNS is hosted on the NA server.  If you’re not normally on this server, you’re still more than welcome to join, but you’ll have to play through the intercontinental latency.  You may want to have an account at level 30 before doing so, though.

**QUESTION: WHERE CAN I WATCH THIS AT?**

Answer: The live stream of the games can be found at [http://own3d.tv/SNSS](http://own3d.tv/SNSS).

Hopefully, in the future, effort can be made to get some of the replays up into a hosting site somewhere, and with time, maybe some casted replays can make it up onto the SNS Youtube account, once that’s up and running.

**QUESTION: WHO IS THE BADASS THAT CAME UP WITH THIS?**

Answer: Crazy MoFo 13

**QUESTION: WHO'S THE AMIABLE GENTLEMAN RUNNING IT NOW?**

Answer: Vendryth

**QUESTION: WHERE’D GIMP SAMURAI GO?**

Answer: Gimp has decided to pass the reins of SNS off so he can focus on other things.  He’s still a part of the Summoner School Community, but he decided, under his own power, to step down from running the show.

**QUESTION: WHERE CAN I SIGN UP TO PLAY OR SHOUTCAST?**

Answer: Check the sidebar!  Or, you can sign-up to play [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFNIZDh2WmQ0RjVrN3c5c0lLbERXZkE6MQ#gid=0) and to shoutcast [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEwyMGlhUEFpaG9na2lpNjdlUnphOWc6MQ#gid=0).

**QUESTION: WHEN SHOULD I SIGN UP?**

Answer: Signups will typically be cleared on Sundays.  A post will go up in the Summoner School subreddit when signups are open again.

**QUESTION: WHAT DOES THE SIGN UP PERIOD END?**

Answer: Tentative schedules will be posted on Thursdays.  If anyone signs up after the first schedule goes out, this is fine, but signups after that schedule will be added to the substitute players list.

**QUESTION: IF I SIGN UP, ARE THERE ANY REQUIREMENTS?**

Answer: Yes. You MUST have mumble installed and configured before you enter the game lobby. If you dont have a mic that is fine, but your ability to hear your team mates is crucial. Check the sidebar for all relevant information on the /r/summonerschool mumble server. Or get all the relevant setup information now and [CLICK HERE](http://redd.it/tawix).

**QUESTION: IS THIS SHOW FAMILY FRIENDLY?**

**FINALLY**: Think about what that means in LoL.

The circle is the combined skills and knowledge of every LoL player on the planet.  Everybody's circle is asymmetric - you, and I mean you, are probably weaker in fundamentals somewhere.  The shape of your circle, or the composition of your skills and knowledge, is *completely unique to you*.  What that means is that **everybody's circle will cover something that yours doesn't***.

Learning from somebody means you squish your circle in their outline and start trying to fill in the gaps.  As far as Summoner School is concerned, this means that you don't have to (and probably shouldn't) be looking for a ""high Elo teacher"" to come save the day.  You don't need one.  Of course, learning from a 2k Elo player means you can potentially learn the most, but there are tons of 1300s that you can still learn something from, and you'll get 8 of them to respond when you ask for general role feedback, versus the daily ""lf high Elo teacher"" thread that receives no real response.

**tl;dr would-be students, stop limiting yourselves by expecting that you need a top player to teach you how to last hit.**

Hey guys.

So yesterday, I offered to write up a list of the top champions to carry games. However, after reading a reply post, I decided that it might not be the best idea, and so instead went with this instead. These 6 champs I'm about to list aren't necessarily the best to carry games or drag yourself out of ELO hell (although they can do just that), but what they do instead is teach you the skills you'll need to know in the +1200 ELO world. So, without further ado, allow me to begin.

**1. Jarvan IV**

'80% testosterone and 20% balls of steel' - Anon.

Jarvan as a champion is like a professor. Every single time you play him, you should be learning something. His kit is essentially really simple, but the ways that his spells chain together leads to some entirely new complexities and will reward great play. In my eyes, he's the most balanced champion in the game, finding the perfect point in between tankiness and damage, as well as being of a similar strength early game through late game. You have to apply yourself when you perform your EQ combo and ultimate and think about how it will affect your teammates, especially with Cataclysm. His jungle route is flexible, his clear time is decent and his ganks are in a class of their own. 

Roles: Solo top, jungle.

Cost: 4800 IP, 975 RP.

**2. Ryze**

'Ryze would have done some dirty, dirty things to her' - Phreak.

Typically, you have to figure out whether to build offensively or defensively. But certain champions decide to fuck what's typical and do both at the same time. Ryze is the paragon of this type of champion. In case you didn't know, Ryze's spells scale off of his maximum mana. A short list of various items containing mana: Rod of Ages, Frozen Heart, Banshee's Veil. That's health, armour, MR and a fuckload of mana, making you one tanky mage whilst being able to constantly churn out damage. Oh yeah, forgot to mention his passive. Every time Ryze casts a spell, all of his cooldowns get reduced by one second, meaning he throws out his spells like a god-damn machine gun. What will Ryze do for you? First, he'll teach you how to smartcast. Playing Ryze without smartcast turned on is like fitting a square peg into a round whole: impossible. The sheer speed that you need to cast spells requires you turn off normal casting. Second, it'll teach you how to combo. There's a bazillion different orders to cast Ryze's spells, and only after time you'll learn how to pull it off (although QWEQ is always a safe bet). Ryze is also a pubstomper. His ult gives all of his spells splash damage, so you can basically walk right into a teamfight, press R, do your combo and receive a penta for your efforts. People at 1200 haven't caught on to how powerful he is, so abuse him before they do.

Roles: Mid, solo top.

Cost: 450 IP, 260 RP.

**3. Gangplank**

'I FIGHT FOR MY FRIENDS' - CholeraNinja

The true jack of all trades, this fella takes a page out of Mundo's book and goes wherever he pleases. Gangplank can quite literally do whatever you want him to, which is what makes him such a beauty to play. His main position is definitely solo top, but he can jungle very well, function as an AD carry if necessary, support due to his buffs, slow and global ultimate, and even mid as a counterpick. His spells don't require a huge amount of skill to use well, and he'll reward every single thing you do right whilst forgiving dumb mistakes. Get CC'd, no problem just eat some oranges bro. He can also be built a million different ways, ranging from full AD carry to full tank, from 'critplank' to a generic Atmogs build. 

Roles: Whatever you want.

**4. Kennen**

'BAN THAT PURPLE FUCK' - Me.

There's something about starting your name with a K and wearing purple that makes champions OP. Kennen is no exception. Strong throughout the game and strong in 3/5 roles, Kennen is really something special. He has everything you could possibly want: stuns, ranged harass, AD multiplier, strong AP ratios, an escape coupled with damage and a huge, fuck-off AoE that stuns and deals a bazillion damage. Typically an AP that can be played mid or solo top, people realised after IEM Kiev that AD Kennen isn't so ridiculous after all due to the stun, easy escape and AD bonus on every fifth attack. Fun to play, fast-moving, high damage and game-changing, what more could you want?

Roles: Solo top, mid, AD carry.

Cost: 6300 IP, 975 RP.

**5. Soraka**

'Always heal, never die' - SsethTzeentach.

So you want to support? Well, lets look at the main choices. Janna: high potential, hard to use. Sona: nerfed. Alistar: hard to use, only really useful for his high kill potential. Lulu: TBD. So who does that leave? Soraka and Taric. Now I'd actually made a very strong point for Taric, but then something else came to me: map awareness. As a support, map awareness is key. Most likely you'll be the only person warding, so you'll need to keep track of timers on them all. You'll need to keep an eye on the best place to dump CV, on where their jungler is ganking, and various other things. Therefore, I thought 'who better to learn map awareness with that someone with a global ult?'. Ergo, Soraka. You can pretty much plant your face on the keyboard and heal someone for like, 800, so she's a great babysitter. Her Q shreds MR, which your AD carry will love you for, and Infuse silences, which can really sadden Katarina, Karthus, Nunu and many other champs. Her passive raises the MR of everyone around you, making you the perfect aura slave from the start, and your global ulti will make people glad they've got a Soraka on their team. Plus, if all else fails, just grab WotA, Glacial Shroud and a Deathcap and roll over mid lane.

Roles: Support, mid.

Cost: 450 IP, 260 RP.

**6. Ashe**

'BIG ARROW EVERY TIME IT HITS ITS SO LONG I CANNOT MOVE, SO MUCH STUN!' - FutbolBR

As Ashe, you gain something over pretty much every other AD carry in the game: utility. The stuff that Ashe can do with her kit is incredible and her kiting power is utter BS. She's got a pretty big range which helps throughout laning phase, as well as her 100% crit chance on her first hit which can give you a huge edge. She gains more gold, which whislst it wont put you ahead by much will still help out a bit. Due to her in-built CV it opens up options for your support to run other summoner spells, namely Heal, leading to more sustain. Also, and perhaps most importantly, you get an initiate. As the main damage output for your team, you need to be able to engage in fights only when you know you've got the potential to come put on top. With her ultimate, you've got this in-build, leaving no excuse for starting a teamfight you're not gonna win. Even cooler, if they try to initiate when you're in a bad spot, just shoot them in their face and wave goodbye to their plans.

Roles: AD carry. Support *can* work, but I don't recommend it.

Cost: 450 IP, 260 RP.

DISCLAIMERS: I DO NOT recommend AD Kennen, or support Ashe, or support GP. They're improvised picks, but there are way better choices for their role.

It's a very useful and necessary thing to utilize to rise higher when playing solo top/mid (it also applies to bottom lane but less, you'll see why) 


When laning, what do you do? You last hit to gain gold, and try to avoid ganks. Sometimes you'll gank/counterjungle as well but let's not get into that. Let's focus on the first point, last hitting.

Last hitting gives you gold (and experience, but you get that from minions dying). Keeping the enemy from last hitting will give you an advantage, but LoL has no direct way (a lá DotA) to do that, instead you have to force your enemy off the minions. Basically, this is a guide on how to control minion flow and how to maximize the enemy's loss from being zoned.

First of all, you need to understand that a ""successful"" denial of a minion is when the enemy dies and they don't gain gold or experience for it. To do this, you have to force them away from the minions. This is way too explained for me to explain how to do just for zoning someone standing in lane, but if you manage to force them out of lane, here's the basic idea of what you want to do: 

1. Check what state the lane is. Where is it pushing? Who has more minions? What are their HPs? 

2. Depending on where the lane is going to go, you want to push or leave it be. 

If the lane is pushing towards the enemy tower and the enemy is not there, push it up as fast as you can. What happens is the enemy tower will kill your minions and the enemy won't get gold/xp. Successful denial!

If the lane is pushing towards your tower, freeze it by tanking minions so that it keeps pushing towards you. This will make the enemy minions kill your minions and the enemy won't get gold/xp. Successful denial!

This knowledge can also be used for clever things like kill trading: If you dive for first blood while the lane is pushed with several minion waves to the enemy turret, you have gained a large advantage over the enemy solo laner because he loses minions to tower while you don't lose anything (or, you barely lose anything).

Utilizing this correctly is 100% needed to play at a higher level in top so you can make their top fall behind and you can snowball.

This got a lot longer than I expected it to, so:

Hello again!  It's been a while since I last posted.  I decided to wait until after the holidays so that there wouldn't be too much of a break between the next few parts.  My intention is to talk about each of the major player roles and their related items, one role per week.  So today I'll talk about tanks, and later this week I'll write a post discussing defensive items.
****
**What Is a Tank?**

Very simply, a tank's job is to **protect the other members** of his team.  This involves absorbing as much damage as possible, using CC to disrupt the enemy team, and pressuring the enemy team to focus on you instead of your carry.  Tanks are also usually responsible for initiating team fights.

**Why Should I Play a Tank?**

A **balanced team composition** will always include *at least* one tank.  This may be a ""hard"" tank (e.g. Rammus) or a character who fulfills two roles at once, such as a jungler-tank or support-tank.  Having two or more ""off-tank"" characters is also common.  Regardless of what kind of team strategy you're picking around, your squishy damage-dealers need protection, and that means tanks.

**Which Stats Are Important for Tanks?**

Health Points (HP), Armor, Magic Resist (MR), Health Regen, and sometimes Move Speed (MS).

**Understanding Resistances**

High Armor and Magic Resist stats are the hallmark of a good tank.  You need to understand the underlying math to make good use of them.

Armor reduces incoming physical damage according to the formula:

% Received = 100/(100 + Armor)

Therefore, at 50 Armor, incoming physical damage is reduced to 100/150 = 66%; at 100 Armor, 50%;  at 200 Armor, 33%.  As you can see, the more Armor you have, the more it takes to improve your defenses.  In other words, we say that **Armor has diminishing returns**.  The formula is exactly the same for magic damage and MR.

Another, more intuitive way to understand resistances is to flip the formula around and state it in terms of HP.  A little mathcraft gives us:

Effective Health = Health Points * (1 + Armor/100)

Said another way, **each point of Armor increases your EHP by 1%**.  So for example, a Shen armed with 3000 HP and 75 Armor effectively has 75% more health vs. physical, i.e. 5250 EHP.  Again, the calculation is identical for Magic Resist.

The bottom line is that at a certain point, it's not as effective to just stack Armor or MR compared to building Health.  Think of Effective Health as a rectangle whose sides have length equal to your HP and Armor - the best way to maximize the area to increase both sides.  Also never forget that building **HP increases your resistance to both physical AND magic damage**.

**Damage Types**

To be an effective tank, you must carefully gauge what kind of damage your opponents are armed with.  This is a skill you will develop with time as you play with more and more different characters. The best way to learn is to pay attention to the death reports each time you die.

*Physical vs. Magic* - Every champion's auto-attack deals physical damage.  Most champion abilities deal magic damage.  You can usually count each character as one type or the other, but be on the lookout for hybridized abilities, armor/MR shreds, and abilities that deal damage as a % of your total health.  Also know (and fear) characters that can deal true damage - you can't mitigate it.

*Burst vs. Sustained* - Most abilities deal a large chunk of damage immediately (burst).  Auto-attacks, spammed abilities, and damage-over-time (DoT) effects.  Notice that Health Regen will protect you somewhat vs. sustained damage, but is useless against burst.

*Single-target vs. Area-of-Effect (AoE)* - As a tank, you want to be aware of the targeting of each enemy's skills, their range, and how you might be able to intercept them.  Look for opportunities to ""catch"" incoming skill shots, but be aware that some will penetrate units (i.e. Caitlyn's Piltover Peacemaker).

**Understanding Crowd Control**

Crowd control (CC) refers to any effect that disables your opponents.  We can separate them into ""soft"" and ""hard"" (channel-interrupting) types.

*Soft* - slows, roots, snares, and blinds

*Hard* - taunts, fears/charms, silences, stuns, knockups, displacements, and suppressions

- Make sure your team has a good amount of CC skills before you lock in - they're critical for shutting down important targets.

- Some CC is conditional, i.e. dependent on enemy position or surrounding terrain.  Don't count on them to always be available.

- Good positioning and Tenacity (Mercury's Treads) are your most important tools against CC, but remember that knockups are unaffected by Tenacity.  Consider taking Cleanse or a buying a Quicksilver Sash if you see a lot of hard CC on the enemy team.

**Be the Initiator**

Most of the time, your team's tank acts as the leader.  As the front line of your formation, they are chiefly responsible for initiating good team fights.  This is a very difficult skill that depends on many factors, as well as gut instinct.  Here are a few tips:

- Tank first.  Squishies in back. **Stay together**.

- Look for an opening in the enemy formation and exploit it.  Choose your moment and commit to the fight.  If your initiation skill places you in the middle of them (Amumu), be sure the rest of your team is ready.

- Be wary of counter-initiating skills. A Sona or Janna ult can completely turn the tables on you.

- If you're running a poke comp, DON'T initiate.  Your goal is to shield your team from the enemy while they poke.

**Plan Ahead!**

The best way to remain an effective tank is to stay ahead of the enemy, so **buy defensive items before you need them**.  When you get to the loading screen after champ select, look at each enemy one by one.  Gauge the balance of magic vs. physical damage, count the amount of CC skills, and remind yourself when each champion is strongest.  If you plan ahead, you won't fall behind.

**Example**: the enemy team is Vayne, Rammus, Sona, Leblanc, and Gangplank.  Counting the CC, I see-see that Vayne has a conditional stun, Rammus has a slow and a taunt, Sona has an AoE stun, Leblanc has a silence, and Gangplank has mild single-target and AoE slows.  Right away, I know I'm going to need Mercury's Treads here.  Beyond that, the first problem will be Leblanc's incredibly high magic damage - a Negatron Cloak will likely be my first important buy.  As we get into late game, Vayne will become their main source of damage, so I'll want a Frozen Heart, Randuin's Omen, and/or Thornmail.  If Gangplank starts getting farmed, I'll need them sooner rather than later.  Rammus and Sona have negligible damage but godly initiating and counter-initiating skills, so I'll have to be on my toes.

First, let me introduce myself.

My name is Rakalakalili and I was a gold rated player in both solo queue and arranged 5s in Season 1. I run a semi-competitive team, and while we haven't done much since the summer (my grad school is really making that hard), we have played against teams like Dignitas, Team Green Forest, etc. (I didn't say we won... but I've killed Voyboy before!!). Our crowning achievement has been taking 9th in a go4lol awhile back (impressive, I know :P). I'm pretty active in the leagueoflegends subreddit, and try to contribute and provide advice as much as time allows it. I'm on break for a couple more weeks here, and during that time I'm going to try to stream solo qeueue games with commentary and try to get my rating up to at least 1700. 

But anyway, I feel like I understand the game pretty well, and can give valuable insight into your game. Be it jungling, any of the lanes, etc. I play most roles and understand a lot of the champions and match ups. I feel one of my strongest things I can help others with is some of the subtelties of laning: lane control, creep aggro, bush control, trading, etc.  Give me a replay and I'll talk about your game for you.

This is going to be a wall of text, and I will be explaining what not many people have seemed to have pieced together. I'm not going to be revealing any secrets, or digging deep into any of Riot's methods or systems, but instead, I will be talking about what we all know already. I will mostly talk about your mentality, while playing League of Legends. This is not going to be a Tips &amp; Tricks post. It's advice, about your attitude and outlook when it comes to the game we all have come to love and enjoy.


To begin, the level of stupidity and immaturity in this game is actually quite profound. Being a troll or trash talking is one thing, but there are too many people that do not have the mental capacity to understand the inner workings of this game. I'm not calling anyone stupid, per se, people do and say stupid things out of ignorance, but I think it just comes down to maturity. Winning a game does NOT mean going 10/0, that could even be irrelevant to the matter of winning or losing. The matchmaking system is designed to setup each match with each player having an inherent 50% chance to win. Playing poorly, might not even decrease your chance of winning. You could in theory, win 3 games in a row, or climb up to Silver I, all on luck. Skill does not always play a part in your win/loss record.


I'm making this post to try to provide awareness of the things I have mentioned and will mention. If even 1 person takes something from this post then I will be happy. I'm not trying to trash talk, rage, make fun of anyone, or offend anyone in any way. I'm sorry if this post hurts your feelings or your ego, I mean for this to help people. Maybe if you realize you win 5 games then lose 5 games, because you are at a point where your individual skill is average. You then, without realizing it, are banking on luck. You might win your lane, get fed and still lose the game. The next game you play, you might lose your lane, feed and still win, and you're sitting there raging, ""I go 10/0 and we lose, then I go 2/7 and we win, thanks Riot."" That is not Riot's fault, just because you can go 10/0 does not mean you will have anything to do with that win. Was the jungler feeding you kills every time he picked someone off, or ganked? Was the support setting up kills for you left and right? I'm sorry but you got carried. If you are truly better than the elo you are in, then climbing out should be easy. 


Just imagine playing against a pro. Let's be honest the average player and most, if not all, of the casual players, would not stand a single chance against them. When they make smurfs, do you think they struggle playing against Silver players? The same goes for a random diamond player, assuming he actually belongs in diamond and wasn't carried there. Do you think a true diamond player would struggle against a silver player? There is no point in climbing the ranks if you are a true silver player, you will just have a terrible time. The most important thing to take from this massively long post is you have to think correctly, to play accordingly. You will always have a chance to lose, regardless of how well you do.


TL;DR Blaming never helps anything, help fellow players help you. Don't rage at the jungler because he hasn't ganked by 5 mintues. Offer them friendly advice, ""I'm pushed to my tower top, it would be an easy gank if you're up for it.""

Being stuck at last pick in low elo is a pain in the butt. most of the time, the first four picks don't want support so you are stuck playing first time Soraka because you don't own any support champs. Worry not, for this guide will help you decide what to buy as your next support and to support carry you out of bronze.

1. Thresh:
Ever since this soul collecting Chain Warden came out, it has always been Thresh City. Thresh brings 3 forms of cc to a team. His Q, a 1.5 second stun that drags an enemy to you, his E which slows for 1.5 seconds and knocks back or knocks forward (depending on how you want to use it) enemy champions, and finally his ultimate, a whopping 99% slow for 2 seconds that does 250 damage plus 100% of your AP at rank one. Thresh's Q has a second activation that can be used similar to an Amumu bandage. This second activation can let you decide whether to initiate or throw down some poke. His E can be used as an engage or disengage. It is amazing for peeling someone off your team. His ult, if cast right, can create amazing kiting potential for your adc and also deals a great burst of magic damage. I havent talked about his W alot because i wanted to save the best for last. His w, a shield, which if an ally clicks on it, will be dragged to you. The shield itself is not alot, but the plays you can make with it, is endless. lets say your Draven gets hooked by an enemy Blitzcrank. all you have to do is throw down the lantern, walk back, and when Draven clicks on it, he will be dragged into safety. His W can also create amazing ganking potential. Thresh is probably one of the best, if not the best, support at the moment. He is my go to support for low elo. Just remember, his Q has a slight cast time so people can dodge it quite easily. Also, Thresh can be shut down by heavy poke supports such as Sona.

2. Leona:
One of the most aggressive supports in the league. She can dive into the middle of the enemy team and help her team do heavy bursts of damage from her passive. She doesn't really have any potential until level 2, when she gets her e or q (whichever one you didn't get at level one). If she lands her E -&gt; Q combo, it will most likely be a secured kill for your adc. Her W gives you alot of resistances for a few seconds, and also a prolonged resistance if her W hits an enemy after it pops. Her ult is an AOE stun (if enemies are caught in the center) or AOE slow (if enemies are hit by the sides). It has incredibly long range and can be used as an initiation or if you are trying to chase down someone. The bad thing about leona is that she is melee and can take heavy poke from enemy adc or support. Leona's main counter is Janna, for Janna can stop Leona's E with her tornado.

3. Sona:
Sona is a very poke heavy champ. She Q and power chord can be used as amazing burst and poke. Her passive gives her great damage on her basic attacks. She can easily bring down enemy champ a good amount of health just from her Q-&gt; powerchord combo. Sona also has a semi-spammable heal to keep her team healthy during teamfights. Sona doesn't have any cc pre-6 besides her e's powerchord(but everyone forgets about it). After 6, Sona has amazing kill potential with her ult. Her ult stuns enemy champions for 1.5 seconds and forces them to dance. Good Sona's can land amazing 5 man ults, or just an 1 man ult in general to secure a kill(Rhux needs to learn from them). One bad thing about Sona is how incredibly squishy she is. She can get 3 hit by Draven's axes at level one. Sona is an amazing counter aggression support.

4. Blitzcrank:
This Great Steam Golem is used to be the number one ban in low elo. No one knew how to deal with him. No one dodged his hooks. Everyone in low elo thought he was ""op"". Recently, Blitz bans have been replaced by Thresh bans. This doesn't mean that blitz isn't good anymore, it is just that thresh has more cc and can secure kills easier. Nonetheless, Blitz is still an AMAZING support and also really fun to play. His Q pulls enemies  right into him and comboed with his E can secure an easy kill. Blitzcrank solely relies on catching people out of place and turning that into a free kill. Blitzcrank's ult is probably the only thing he can offer in teamfights, besides pulling in the adc or mid laner for an easy kill. Blitz has no heals or shields for an ally, but can easily set up kills. One thing amazing about blitzcrank is his mana shield. His mana shield can be used to bait or kite enemies while your team rain damage on them. Blitz's main counter is thresh, for thresh's lantern can pull people away from your hugs.

5. Janna:
The God of all peels. Although I am not a good Janna player, I know the basic mechanics of her. Janna has an amazing shield that gives ad. She has amazing peels for her adc from her q and her ult. Her Q can knock up quite alot of people if landed, but it can be easily dodged if the reaction time is fast enough. Her ult is an amazing disengage or displacement tool. You can flash ult into the middle of the enemy team to split them up. If you can ult then flash away if someone is chasing you. I really have nothing to say about Janna because I'm probably the worst Janna player out there.

6. Lulu:
The stupid Yordle. Just kidding. Lulu brings amazing poke during the laning phase from her e -&gt; q combo. The slow from your Q is great for ganks and the vision you get from your E really helps. Your e can also be a shield if cast on an ally. Your W is just an amazing form of cc. It is basically a silence and a fear all in one. Her ult gives an amazing amount health and also knocks up the enemies around it. It also gives an aoe slow around your ally cast. Lulu is also kind of squishy early game but brings alot of damage onto the table.

7. Zyra:
Zyra. Dat Plant. Zyra was first made as an ap carry, but over time, she became to be known as a support. Her root is an awesome initiation or a peel. Her plants deal alot of damage if you just let them be there. Also, with her ult, her plants do so much damage. You wouldnt really notice it until mid team fight. Zyra is pretty squishy but her snare makes up for it. You cant get close enough to her or her adc to do damage. Also her ult is an aoe slow into a knock up that does a ton of damage. If you want a pretty easy support, Zyra is your go to. The only thing she lacks is a heal or a shield, but like I said, you can't get close enough to her.

8. Elise:
The Chinese and Koreans are doing it. So it has to be pro. I took some time to think about it. You have a stun which is a peel and also an initiate. You can also bait with your e in spider form. When the enemy team focus all their cc on you, you can just e dodge it while your team do the damages. Also, you do percentage damage so it is pretty good since you dont need to build a whole bunch of ap to do damage. You can poke with your q in human form because it does damage base on max health. Your combo will be the same as if you were top lane, but try not to use it as an execute but try to lower them for you adc to be an easy kill.

9. Nami:
Nom Noms. Squishy yet good. Well so is sona. The thing about nami is that her poke, is also her heal. I really like the fact that after you deal damage, you can also heal yourself. Also, her ""E"" is an amazing if you put it on an adc to help with kiting. It is sort of like a 3 hit red buff. Her stun is amazing, although it can be fairly easy to dodge, but since this is low elo, it doesnt really matter. As you carry yourself higher, players will be dodging your stuns quite easily. Her ult is just amazing, its like a shurelya's and also the slow on it is really good. The range on the ult is pretty high, making it pretty easy to chase down other people.

10. Alistar: 
The minotaur. The old number one ban in low elo in season 2. Why? Because he is great. His Q is an amazing aoe knockup that can help save teamates or you can combo it with your e for great damage and cc. Alistar's W-&gt; Q combo is probably one of the hardest combos to land in low elo. If the WQ combo is landed, it is a for sure kill if the other enemy dont have flash or any sort of get away. Alistar has an amazing burst of damage for a tank. Also, this horned support has a great heal that gets its cooldown reduced if an enemy unit dies near so the cooldown on it is pretty short. Also, alistar's ult gives him a free cleanse, attack damage, and damage reduction. Late game, he can run into an enemy team, create huge disturbance while keeping his team health. Alistar is also really good at catching people out. My suggestion is that if you cant land the WQ combo, go for a Q, run behind the enemy, and W headbutt them back.

But I don't understand why.

Playing as Quinn, I fell in love. The ult can be used in some really cool ways, and her kit makes her an extremely fun champion to play, as well as being very powerful. But everybody I talk to seems to hate her -- they say she's boring, or that she's weak, or any other number of problems.

Am I just part of a niche of people who think Quinn is good, or is there something about higher elo that changes the way she plays?

For the record, I've only won as many games as I've lost, but I still played reasonably well from a mechanical stand point -- most of my problems came from not pushing lanes or from sloppy team fights across the board. The champion herself I feel I played well, and the average k/d/a is apparently 10/6/6, and I've started losing less matches already -- this is over 18 matches total.

Pros, from my (unranked, fresh level 30) point of view:

1. I get exp, which is great for an APC
2. I can wait for an exceptionally opportune time to initiate.
3. I can watch for the opponent wanting to b and help my laner shove the wave into tower / take tower.
4. I can often avoid pink wards.

Cons, aka Reasons my teammates bitch at me for it:

1. I'm not putting pressure on any other lane (even though enemy can't see me)
2. I put them behind in XP (which is a big deal for some champions, especially pre 6)

About CS, I only take CS if the laner is going to be away for some reason (backing or ganking).

If you are playing Jungle Lee Sin try to use smite to clear Q's path. That way your enemies will get on surprise and you will get free Q on them. If your mechanics are quick enough you should always hit this Q.

Basically what happend there. I was covering top because my top laner died and ez was really hurting me(I had 21-9 masteries). So at this point I had two options: 1) Leave the lane and let him hit the turret or 2) Kill him.

I choose to kill him but he was protecting himself from my Q inside of the creep wave. So I used smite on a creep in front of him that help me him my Q and I got the Kill. :)

#Abilities

&gt; * **Rebirth** - Upon dying, Anivia will transform into an egg and will get an armor and magic resistance &gt; modifier of 
−40 / −25 / −10 / +5 / +20. If the egg can survive for 6 seconds, she is reborn with the same &gt; percentage of health that her egg had left. Rebirth has a static cooldown and is unaffected by cooldown reduction.

A solid passive during almost all stages of the game. The most skilled Anivia players will rarely get egged unless they're baiting the enemies into a kill. It aids Anivia in that she's a squishy, low mobility champion who can easily get caught and die -- however, with proper peel and build you can occasionally rise from the ashes and get back into the fray. It's important to note that Anivia's Cooldown on this ability is below flash's CD -- so if you have the choice you should choose to get egged over flashing.

&gt; * **Flash Frost**
&gt; ACTIVE: Anivia fires an orb of ice that travels in a line at 850-speed. All enemies it hits take magic damage and are ""chilled"" for 3 seconds, slowing their movement speed by 20%. The shard will detonate when reaching its maximum range or if the ability is activated again. When the shard explodes, it deals the same damage to all enemies within 75 range, stuns them for 1 second, and ""chills"" them for 3 seconds.

Anivia's bread and butter skillshot. It's slow moving and hard to land against competent players; but for good reason. It has a ridiculous ratio and base damage, as well as being Area-Of-Effect (referred to as AOE for the rest of this guide). The skill is what you base most of your catch-potential on late game; you want to funnel people into your stun by using Crystallize against the terrain of the map. It's important to note that this skilli s on a decently long cooldown early game, so it's risky to throw it out during lane until you've skilled up your wall and other abilities. It's also an ability that you can activate again to ""detonate"" the charge early for the stun. This is VERY important!


&gt; * **Crystallize**
&gt; : Anivia creates an impassible wall of ice centered on target point, perpendicular to Anivia's facing, lasting 5 seconds.

This is the skill that makes Anivia so incredibly powerful in competitive (as well as solo-queue) games. You can use this ability to completly wall off areas for escape, or funnel your Q, or just to trap enemies into your R. Make sure to utilize terrain to completely change people's pathing. You don't ALWAYS have to use it this way however, and that's why I take a point in wall at 4. In a gank you can throw wall in the middle of the lane and use Q and hope they run to the side you aim your Q - a combo that is stronger than most expect.

&gt; * **Frostbite**
&gt; Anivia fires a shard of ice to deal magic damage to a target enemy. Frostbite deals double damage to enemies ""chilled"" by Anivia's other spells

Your main nuke! It's pretty spammable in teamfights and has good scaling. It's important to note that R-&gt; E (or E-&gt;R depending if you want to launch the E first and use R before it lands to conserve mana) works as well as Q-&gt; E. Don't be afraid to use this spell to lasthit in lane.

&gt; * **Glacial Storm**
&gt; TOGGLE: Anivia creates a blizzard in a target 800-diameter area. Enemies inside this area take magic damage over time and are ""chilled"", slowing their movement and attack speed by 20%. Glacial Storm drains mana from Anivia while active, and deactivates if she runs out.

Very high damage, AOE spell that is very mana costly. This is the main reason you see most people focus on Mana-heavy mid builds similar to [](/Kassadin). Using this ability properly in teamfights is huge, as the uptime is reliant on you not getting CC'd during your intended channel time. Try not to ult before you're CCd as the downtime is fairly long.

*****
# Skill Order

**skill order is ALWAYS situational. If your team is reliant on many early skirmishes, start leveling wall a little bit earlier. If you don't think the enemy jungle or your jungle will affect mid at all, don't take wall until later! E is pretty much a must-max though.**

Q E E W E R E Q E Q R Q Q W W R W W 

TL;DR R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; W OR R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q 

*****
##Item build

**Once again, item building is ALWAYS situational. No amount of guide-reading will teach you the correct items to buy. You have to have a feel for the champion and know what you need for that specific game. Part of becoming a better player is understanding how itemization works for different champions and team compositions.**

**UPDATE**: Liandry's torment is now almost mandatory to buy on Anivia due to the bugfix that gives the item its proper damage. Don't miss out! **


START: [](/faeriecharm) [](/healthpotion) [](/healthpotion) [](/healthpotion) [](/healthpotion) [](/manapotion) [](/sightward)

farie charm, 5 pots, 1 mana pot, singular ward

This is what I start in 99% of my games midlane. The charm allows you go build off into either a [], [](/tearofthegoddess) tear, or [](/chaliceofharmony) chalice. The potions are for sustaining yourself. I always start with a ward mid because I hate being killed early by ganks, it's probably the one way that makes laning with Anivia actually extremely hard. If you're in a hard 1v1 lane like kass or fizz you should probably try to pick up the raw stat items from catalyst (ruby/sapphire) first as mana regen does absolutely nothing for you.

MIDGAME: [](/sorcerersshoeshomeguard) [](/rodofages) [](/hauntingguise) [](/tearofthegoddess)
 
sorc shoes, RoA, Haunting Guise, and Tear of the Goddess should be finished at the midgame. 

Homeguard are an optional buy. Most of the time I get them after Catalyst and get them with Sorcerer's shoes in one go. Sorc boots are generally the best on Anivia as sorc shoes are the cheapest flat pen casters can buy, helping their midgame powerspike. Homeguard are comparable to a GP10 in terms of their value; the earlier you get them the less time you spend in your fountain waiting and shopping. In lane I prefer to get a catalyst first because the HP and mana just help your glacial storm feel less taxing and it allows you to farm easier than rushing tear. Once both tear and Catalyst are acquired, laning mana problems aren't really an issue anymore. Blue is taken from that point to allow Anivia to roam as well as compete with the other caster mid in terms of waveclear and farm.

LATEGAME: [](/sorcerersshoeshomeguard) [](/rodofages) [](/liandrystorment) [](/seraphsembrace) [](/voidstaff) LAST SLOT SITUATIONAL. 

Late game important items: Sorc Shoes, ROA, Liandry's, Seraph's, Void Staff 

(Sorcs can be substituted for merc post-void) The last slot is situational for my 6 item build because there are too many good options for Anivia when it comes to the last choice. You could go [](/zhonyashourglass) zhonya, [](/rabadonsdeathcap) deathcap, [](/warmogsarmor) or even warmogs. It all comes down to whether your team needs more damage or you need more survivability/utility. 

SITUATIONAL: [](/abyssalscepter) abyssal [](/guardianangel), GA [](/athenesholygrail), athene's, [](/bansheesveil) bveil [](/spiritofthespectralwraith) spirit of the spectral wraith  [](/morellonomicon) or morellonomicon

These items are all based around countering certain things. Abyssal is what you need to build if you end up buying a negatron against [](/leblanc) and don't feel like you want a Veil, GA against resetters like [](/khazix) or [](/katarina), athene's if you aren't getting blue buff, banshee's against veigar or kassadin, etc. Morellonomicon is an undervalued item that is great against heavily sustaining midlanes like vlad or swain as it's hard to all-in them without ignite. The spectral item I tried because Scarra was building it and it's not a bad replacement for catalyst if you're in a heavy farm lane like Karthus who will outscale you damagewise if you don't farm up like hell. 
*****
##Itemization Explanation

The reason I build the way I do is because [](/anivia) needs a vast mana pool to output constant DPS in teamfights. [](/athenesunholygrail) is a great item on her, but it leaves you awfully squishy during the midgame. Playing [](/anivia) as a super-squishy glass-cannon is great in terms of damage, but her range isn't actually that high. You have to be in the fray and be able to tank burst.

The good thing about Anivia is that she scales far better off of penetration and the mana-items than most AP casters. [](/rabadonsdeathcap) isn't mandatory on Anivia! Once you have the late-game core of [](/liandrystorment), [](/rodofages), [](/seraphsembrace), [](/voidstaff), and [](/sorcerersshoes) you output a very high amount of damage to all targets due to your high base damage and AOE spells. I recommend building Void over Deathcap in most games unless you're snowballing super hard and can buy deathcap after RoA. Deathcap is extremely expensive and in most games you won't be able to finish it if you opt for [](/liandrystorment) first due to the high cost of deathcap. If you don't have [](/voidstaff) after 

*****
##Summoner Spells

[](/flash)[](/ignite) or [](/flash)[](/teleport) or [](/flash)[](/barrier). Generally you want to use the first set for lane aggression as Anivia can catch many laners off-guard with her Q-E early game and with flash + snowflake auto and ignite you can easily secure a kill in lane. You CAN take TP as well and do fine but I advise taking ignite in almost every matchup once you have played enough Anivia.

EDIT: After experimenting with the spell more, I believe barrier is also a very viable option as a midlaner as it is great on champs like TF or Anivia that can be bursted quickly in teamfights. Barrier is good versus hard lane like Fizz or Kassadin as well. Barrier also generally beats ignite in 1v1 trades, so keep that in mind! 


*****

##Laning

From 1-6 Anivia's matchups range from incredibly aggressive to passive as can be. It's important to look at the enemy jungle pick and determine how aggressive you're able to be against your lane 1v1. If they have massive early pressure [](/

Versus melee assassins like [](/akali) or [](/diana) you should be autoing them every time they go for a CS to pressure them and make them burn potions. Make sure you don't auto him standing in his creepwave, anivia's base health is low due to having her egg passive and minions WILL chunk you down if you aren't careful! Continue to pelt them with snowflake after snowflake for every CS. Next CS they go for, shoot out a Q and see if they choose to go for the CS - if they have been harassed properly you can kill most lanes from ~60% if your E gets the double damage and you ignite/auto accordingly. 

Versus standard caster lanes, use auto harass as well but don't bother throwing out your Q too much if you feel they are equal skill level -- if you don't hit them they can use that window to burst/all-in you! Be careful for ganks and farm up. 

Once you hit 6 Anivia has a tremendous power spike as you can reliably land your E's double damage due to Glacial Storm. This is when you should start being aggressive (assuming you have coverage with [](/sightward)). Constantly land E -&gt; R's on your opponent. Once you have them at ~50-60% throw down your Crystallize and try to land Flash Frost followed by Frostbite for the kill. Once this technique is mastered you'll be able to reliably force flash from your enemies.

# Runes

(Standard Page)

&gt; 9x MPen Red, 9x Hybrid Pen Red, or 9x AD red

&gt; 9x HP@18, Armor, or flat mana regen Yellow

&gt; 9x MagicResist Blues 

&gt; 3x MoveSpeed Quints 

(Melee-Abuse Page) (for Akali, Kassadin, Diana, Fizz, etc)

&gt; 9x HybridPen Red

&gt; 9x Armor Yellow

&gt; 9x MR Blue

&gt; 3x HybridPen Quints

The first page is standard. Anivia needs MS quints to perform her kiting-esque role properly. She also has ridiculously low base values in everything due to her egg and strong kit. You don't need AP in blues nor quints as Anivia has very high base damages. Yellows are preferential, I usually run HP@18 or armor.

With the season3 nerfs to flat armorpen and flat magicpen runes, hybrid pen runes got a bump up in terms of their gold values. On champions that can utilize them like Nidalee, Rumble, etc and certain niche mid-lane matchups they are very effective. I find with the 2nd page I can usually earn firstblood in the first few minutes against melee champs.

*****
##Teamfighting

Teamfighting with Anivia is probably the hardest aspect of her kit but also the strongest. In the words of Morello, it's what seperates the good Anivias from the great Anivias. 

Focus firstof on making sure that you are positioned properly to deal constant damage throughout the fight. The biggest mistake at lower elo ranges is that people try too hard to tunnel the carries on champions not designed to do so (see: other carries). Positioning is extremely important on Anivia as if you're CC'd the first second you start your ult your damage will plummet. 

After you are set with your positioning, you have to react to whichever team decided to initiate. If the other team initiated onto your team, try to seperate their team from following up on their initiation with your Crystallize. If your team initiated, focus first on stunning as many as possible with Flash Frost and using your wall **AFTER** the other team has blown their escapes/ and [](/flash) spells. 

After the initial followup to whichever initiate, you need to focus on whoever's still standing, obviously. If your AD carry is stronger than theirs, focus on peeling the bruisers off of your AD with your ultimate and flash frost. If the other AD is vastly stronger, try to see if you can land your enhanced nuke on them. Once you're farmed, a double Q and E should be enough to 90% most AD carries unless it's a 60minute game. Don't be afraid to leave your R channeling for long times in teamfights if you have [](/bluebuff)
*****
##Moving around the Map

I figured I should write a section about this, because as a mid main who jungles as his secondary role, it is one of the most butchered synergies of any of the roles. Mid and Jungle, when coordinated, can easily destroy a solo-queue game through the shared control of the objectives on the map, whether that be  [](/redbuff),  [](/bluebuff),  [](/dragon), or towers. 

The mid should always be the one following the jungler's leads and pings in a solo-queue scenario. Ever since the Season 3 mega-patch, sitting in lane and farming is not nearly as effective as roaming and picking up kills as a team, which encourages coordinated roams, ganks, and early bids for objectives. The point being: **LISTEN TO THE JUNGLER WHEN HE PINGS YOU TO COME, IF YOU START SNOWBALLING AND ELIMINATING THE OTHER JUNGLER, YOU START TO CONTROL THE BUFFS AND CONTROLLING THE BUFFS IS THE SECRET TO SOLO QUEUE!**

#CHAMPION SYNERGIES AND MATCHUPS -

[](/amumu) - Notable for his awesome AOE ulti as well as his early pressure. 2 stuns in mid lane is an easy first blood if all skills land! It's hard to play against amumu because he has so much CC to keep you locked up. Don't use your R until he blows his if he's saving it for you -- his R WILL cancel a lot of your damage-

[](/ahri) - One of the harder mid-lane matchups for Anivia. She has kill potential on you at 6 but it's still definitely a skill matchup. She's incredibly squishy so you can kill her 1-5 as well as after 6 depending on how solid your mechanics are. Don't throw out your stun to farm or she can easily go aggressive on you. Ahri's cooldowns are low enough that she can kill your egg fairly quickly.

[](/akali) - Medium/Hard matchup, but only once she hits 6. Before then focus on pegging her with snowflakes and landing Q-E's. Make sure you use your ultimate on her shroud and fight her ontop of your ultimate instead of running away and losing potential DPS. It's also good to use your ult on her shroud.

[](/alistar) - A great support pick against and with [](/Anivia). His high amounts of CC disrupt her damage and can also be used to lock-down a target if he's on the same team with Anivia.

[](/annie) - A champion that is seldom picked, but is actually incredibly strong versus Anivia. Her burst can instantly egg you and she has the DPS to kill your egg. No kill potential for Anivia if Annie is playing properly 1v1. With a jungler that knows how to pressure Annie, it's not terrible.

[](/ashe) - Great initiate, easy to follow up on with Anivia. You can also wall people into arrows which is surprisingly effective. 

[](/blitzcrank) - Anivia is slow and squishy, a great target for Blitzcrank. I tend to pick up a [](/bansheesveil) versus this champion. Very good with anivia due to wall/hook combo and double stuns at level 1 for solid invade potential. 

[](/brand) - Skill matchup, brand has far less teamfight utility and has a more skillshot-based laning phase. 

[](/cassiopeia) - Hard, skill matchup. Either of you can win depending on who lands their skills. Cassio is more vulnerable in teamfights but early game she burns through your egg quickly.

[](/chogath) - Super obnoxious lane. You have no kill potential on him due to his sustain, high amount of CC, and innate tankiness. He's easy to gank early so try to snowball a lead that way with your jungler. If you don't kill him pre6 you'll have issues killing him the entire game assuming he itemizes properly.

[](/diana) - Easy matchup, take hybrid pen runes and auto her. You can easily punish her with Q-E's when she goes for lasthits early game. Post 6 it gets difficult as smart dianas will rush abyssal and just all-in you anytime they see your jungler elsewhere. She bursts your egg quickly with her AA passive so it's a lot harder to eggbait her.

[](/elise) - Previously a tough matchup due to Elise's Rappel mechanic making landing your Q hard. After the nerfs she's not as tough though. You can stay out of range easily. 

[](/evelynn) - You can poke her pretty easily and get an advantage through that. You push hard enough to punish her roam later so it's not a bad lane. Similar to TF in the sense that she's not looking to kill you 1v1

[](/gragas) - Hard matchup. Anivia is slow and squishy and gragas has high AD from his W to kill your egg and enough sustain to deal with your poke.

[](/kassadin) - Hard lane, he ""counters"" you with his silence. Take in mind he's melee with low armor values generally. Poke him hard and push him into tower. 

[](/fizz) - really annoying, similar to kassadin. He can snowball 1v1, be careful! Don't let him hit you with a fish. Take barrier.

If you do, I'll post my other articles (past and future) here, otherwise you can find them on my facebook page (link below).

Hi guys, I'm the guy that made the post yesterday about The Solo Que Invade, back with another tip for ways to improve your game. One of the reasons I like invading so much is because it gives me something to do right away, no sitting around. Well, here is something I started doing while I was mid-Gold that helped me get going on the game during the loadscreen.

If you don't know much about team comps, read this article: http://www.team-dignitas.net/articles/blogs/League-of-Legends/3100/Solo-Queue-Team-Composition-The-Tragedy-of-the-Commons/

As a side note, play what you are good at, don't change your champion to something you aren't comfortable with simply to fit your team comp. But, if you CAN play a champion that fits better into your team's comp, try to do so. Some champions (i.e. Sona) fit comfortably into any comp.

Okay, with the preliminaries out of the way, let's get into the meat of the matter: Composition Analysis. When I'm in the loadscreen, I look at their comp, and then our comp. Usually their is some sort of unity to it (if they have an Amumu, they probably have MF, Karthus, or Sona). No comp (that I've ever seen) is one dimensional. For example, Amumu is easily recognized as having strong AOE, but he is also a very strong diver, and can peel well if needed. That being said, I wouldn't expect him to be splitpushing, and he doesn't have any poke to speak of. He would probably fit best into a dive-AOE comp with Karthus, Graves, Sona, and Jarvan, who are also strong in both AOE and dive potential.

The first step is to determine what class of comp each team has 1:unified 2:functional 3: disorganized. A unified comp would be one where everyone is trying to do the same thing (like the AOE dive comp listed above). A functional comp might have 3-4 people doing the same thing, with 1-2 others that don't stack with the rest of the team, but can be used in tandem with the rest of the team. For example, take Jarvan out of the example comp and sub in Shen. Shen can splitpush and ult back to create the 4v5s he is know for, and can plausibly get off his taunt on several people, so he still works very well with the comp. The same could be done with TF in place of Karthus, also splitpushing, and using his semi-AOE in teamfights he can quickly rejoin. A disorganized comp could be Taric, Caitlyn, Vlad, Elise, Talon.

If a team does not have an organized comp, you have the advantage of being able to run your comp however you feel like given it's strengths. If they do however, you have to take into consideration their strengths and avoid them, while still playing your comp as strongly as possible. I made the following guide for myself when considering team comps (don't take it too seriously, it's more like a rule of thumb):

AOE&gt; Dive, Peel (divers all go at a target, so if you clump, they clump, making is easy to get the AOE off on everyone. In order to peel for a hyper carry, you have to be close to them, which makes it easy to get AOEs off on everyone, including the hyper carry.)

Splitpush&gt; AOE, Peel (If you are splitpushing, dividing their team up, they can't chain off their AOE abilities, nor can the hyper carry get the peel they need).

Dive&gt; Poke, Splitpush ( Nidalee is a signature poke champion, how do you kill her? Dodge one spear and then dive on her. The same generally holds true of other strong poke champions. Divers are usually strong 1v1ers, and so if a team is divided by their splitpush, the divers can force 1v1 fights that they will muscle their way through.

Poke&gt; AOE, Splitpush (Pokers don't need to clump up, which allows them to delay an engage indefinitely, giving them more and more time to get poke off. Splitpushing takes time to get towers, giving more time to get poke off, just keep waveclearing and again, you can poke indefinitely)

Peel&gt; Poke, Dive (As long as the hypercarry doesn't get hit by poke, the poke doesn't matter. What's more, shields/heals can mitigate poke substantially. Peelers are good at pulling off divers, mitigating their damage, CCing them when they dive, etc.)

Again, no comp is going to fit into just one of these categories, a unified comp will usually fit into 2-3, but could theoretically fit all 5 (Sona, Morgana, Nautilus, Vlad, Caitlin), there are a lot of variables to consider when analyzing comps.

I have downloaded some recording software and will try to have a video of The Solo Que Invade up tonight, and if there is interest will also do one on Composition Analysis.

Thanks for reading!

edit: One thing that I did to absorb this that might help you is to draw a diagram of this concept. I did a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock style pentagon starting with AOE and going (clockwise) to Dive -&gt; Splitpush -&gt; Peel -&gt; Poke -&gt; AOE. You can fill in the other arrows according to the list above. Feel free to share what you come up with if you are so inclined. I kept this diagram with me when I played league for awhile, but got to know it well enough after awhile that I jut kind of lost track of it :p

If I see many of these messages I wont post again. Thanx in advance!""** 


Hi guys! My IGN is RollinHard and I'm a gold rated player. I believe that my game knowledge is pretty good while my mechanics are bronze level (if not below that). 

**Anyways, what is this you may ask.**

I want to help out as much as I can with making these begginer guides here on summoner school. I will share the knowledge and the whole theory behind things I understand, so people that dont know these things can get better at the game. You know what they say, give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, teach him how to fish and he will eat for hos entire life. This is what I want to do here so let's get started!


 * First of all, we must divide junglers in categories. This can be done in many ways ; Early Game - Late Game, Strong 1v1 or not, Gank heavy - Farm Heavy, Objective Control - Not, Carry - Supporty.

For example, Cho Gath is one of my favourite picks these days. He is a jungler who has a good clear, thus a good farmer, can have great ganks if you land Rupture's, has great objective control with ult, not mana reliant so you can donate your blue to mid AND has free stats.

Shyvana, on the other hand, is a more farm heavy champion than Cho, she has an amazing clear time, great mobility around the map, no mana, low CD ult, good damage, potent duelist, great counter jungler. You can't gank though and thats what hurts her most.

**But RollinHard, why are you explaining this to us? Knowing these things wont help me a lot, plus I already know most of them.**

*Well, that's our 1st lesson, know your jungler.*

 * How many times have you seen a jungler fail? All of these times, it was due to poor decision making, since jungle doesn't have 1v1's or ganks. When playing jungle, you must first ask yourself some questions;

1. What should I pick here ; Does your team need ganks, tankyness, CC, damage? Going in champion select and picking without thinking is a big handicap. How can a top lane Gangplank with a jungle Shyvana ever get a kill vs Zed? Guess what. They can't. But Zed can because his jungler is Maokai or Skarner or Alistar. When picking a jungler, watch your lanes first. If your bot lane is Graves-Sona and you want to snowball that lane, dont pick a heavy damage jungler without CC, pick something with strong CC pre-6. This way, you can gank even before Sona gets her Creshendo, snowballing Graves and giving your team a huge lead.

2. On the other side, why would you pick Nautilus when your team consists of Malphite, Lissandra, Ashe and Taric/Alistar? You already have great CC in all lanes, better get that jungle Nocturne you want to play so much, get fed and deal damage. In a tourney, TSM once picked Shyvana jungle and Jayce top. Guess what, they just couldnt gnak top lane since all SHyvana had was exaust and its on a realy high cooldown.


 * Play according to your junglers powers. This is pretty straight forward ;
1.  When playing jungle Shyvana or Malphite, dont gank a lot, unless your opponents are overextending like a thousand miles. Farm up to level 6 and then go try your best with your ult. Don't spend time with low chances, you will probably lose your time. 
1. On the other hand, playing gank heavy champions like Maokai or Shaco, farming wont help you much, you dont realy need it (Maokai doesnt need farm, Shaco needs so much, he cant realy get it from farming, only kills and a ton of split pushing). Unless you get good ganks with Shaco in the first levels, you will be super useless lategame, so do your best and gank non stop in early levels.
1.  Nunu is another of my favoutites this days. People always said that he is extremely strong early game. I couldn't understand it for a long time, untill I figured it out. Nunu isnt strong in dueling, he is strong because of objective control. He is strong because when you know he is around, you just cant try to clear your buffs because he can steal them, snowball you and run away and generaly not kill you, but win you the hard way. He can also do a realy quick drake, you can pull of a 5 minute drake with just your mid laner in soloQ, which is a realy good chunk of early game money for your entire team. If you dont win the enemy jungler hard with Nunu via stealing at least 1 of his buffs or dont get a realy early drake, later you become a moving bloodboil, a support which slows people and all the farm you got from the jungle realy went to waste.

 * Almost all lanes are gankable, use your brain! Since I don't realy know how to make graphs etc, Ill try to explain it realy well; there are at least 3 ganking routes to every lane. Let's pick top lane, you have the river gank, the lane gank and the tribrush gank. Unless the enemy wards all 3 entrances to his lane, which **NOONE does and I realy mean NOONE**, as long as you are able to figure out which path is not warded you can probably gank him. A tip here is to always use the lane gank when in doubt. Most people will ward the river brush in top lane, some of them will ward the tribrush, almost noone will ward the lane brush. Its the gank that will solve your problems most of the time. Also, when you gank, try to go the long way through the enemies jungle, this way you will avoid the river ward which is the one 80% of top laners use. 


**Anyways, this was our first lesson, I hope you guys found it helpful and I'll wait the comments to see if you want more of this. You can ask me question in the comments or even tell me what you want me to cover next for you cause I run out of ideas quickly. Sorry for my formating, I suck hard at formating ;.;**

That's the link to the post made on the League of Legends subreddit. I'll copy and paste it here as well:

Alright, to start off with I have a quick survey:

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/C6QCBZ3

The purpose of this, as you might guess, is that I'm considering creating a bot that will match players together (either through the IRC or through a website, not sure yet) and automatically invite them to a game once there are 10 people. However, I don't want to go to the effort of creating this if everybody is satisfied with using the current method of creating games!

This would also have the ability to blacklist players, as well as give ""kudos"" to good players.

The rest of this post is a copy and paste from my last post:

**I've been seeing a lot of people posting asking to participate - you don't need to post! Just join the chatroom ""Platinum vs Silver"" and try to find a game. Sadly, there aren't enough platinum players to go around, so you may not find one. Also, if the chatroom fills up, try joining ""Platinum vs Silver 2"".**

Platinum versus silver is a great idea that was very popular when it was originally created. For the first few days, we had anywhere from 1 to 3 games going at a time. Unfortunately, the lack of players (especially plats, though we have a couple diehard users that fill out games fairly often) make starting games a pain - generally we get close to the point where the game times out. So I'm reposting this to try and get some new blood into the chat.

To those unfamiliar with the concept, basically what happens is this. 5 ""plat"" (high gold through challenger -lolchallenger yeah right) players play against 5 ""silver"" (bronze through low gold) players. The plat players generally crush the silver players, and then give tips and advice on how to play better, explain mistakes, etc. Occasionally the silver players do pretty well - but this is not an invitation to tell the plat players they're not blaming the jungler enough! :P

This is just a stand-alone repost so people that are interested can find the info easier as very few had a look at the other post.  

I am open to any questions about any matchup you may want to discuss and how to beat or play that lane specifically.  Note that the list is not every single matchup possible but more of a general guide to what you will see the most in anything from 800 to 2000 elo.

/r/SummonerPreschool is now live, for the sole purpose of letting new players find other people to play with. The main theory/advice threads will stay here, and people offering level 30 teaching will still post here as well. But it should be a good place for newbies to get some buddies and make the leveling experience a bit nicer.

I'd like to encourage people leveling smurfs to head over there as well, because it will let you do some teaching while getting your other acc up to 30. 

CSS and style wise, I will start harassing Kuena about soon. Hopefully get something similar to this, maybe even get that light theme finished. 

Mod-wise, I had the idea of always having a leveling player as a mod, to keep in touch with the young Summoner traditions (played a game on my smurf the other day, and Corki leveled E first. I told him bro, level Q first, and everyone told me I was mad, and that Corki always leveled E, not like I have been playing Corki for nearly 3 years or anything. Rant over). Not sure if this is a good idea or not, and taking modship off people once they hit 30 would be silly. 

So yea. Go forth, make friends and be merry! The chatroom Summoner Preschool will also be active in game from now. It will use the same mumble/IRC/etc.

Please be logged into League of Legends 10-15 minutes before your game is scheduled to start, as the lobby will be formed at that time, and if you are not on, substitutes will be found to take your place.  

Saturday Night Scrims works on a three strikes system.  If you are scheduled to play and listed on a team, and you do not show up and you have not notified anyone that you will not be present, you get three chances.  After that, you will be blacklisted from SNS for a month.  Please don’t let it come to that.  We enjoy having people join us for the festivities.

Please have Mumble set up and ready to go before your game.  If you’ve never used Mumble before, setup information can be found [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tawix/tutorial_step_by_step_setting_up_mumble_for/)

We play Regular Dominion Matches, [Ultimate Bravery](http://giantfunny.com/ultimate_bravery.php), [ARAB](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1481595), and ARAM (Proving Grounds). Additionally, we like to mix and match them at times to stir things up.  These games, save for the pre-show, will be casted by the group that was doing the casting for the previous game, save for the pre-show.

I have exactly eight people signed up for the novice match that are under level 30.  I have my fingers crossed that they'll show up, because I would absolutely love to have an entire match of novices under level 30.

At the moment, the inactivity of the Team Battles participants, by and large, has put the showmatch on hold for the time being.  I may consider bringing back the Advanced Match again and rotating that in and out on a bi-weekly basis with the showmatch.

That said, Team Battles teams, you have to motivate yourselves!  Suraqah is the program admin, but that doesn't mean you have to have him yell at you to get started!  Scrim!  Practice!  Do something!

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/ashe ""Ashe"") **Ashe, the Frost Archer**

Best kiting champion in the game. One of the best initiate abilities there is. Decent damage with incredibly good sustained DPS over the course of a fight. One of the single best carries to learn positioning with because she's autoattack dependent rather than ability dependent. Best champion to learn to kite with as well as chase with thanks to her infinite slow.

Masteries: 21/0/9, standard AD.

Runes: 9x flat AD reds, 9x flat armor yellows, 9x MR/level blues, 3x flat AD quints. Standard AD to prioritize last hitting, taking as little harass as possible, and having better MR for lategame.

Summoners: [](/flash) and any of: [](/heal), [](/ghost), [](/cleanse). The second depends on your playstyle and what you find works best. 

* [](/cleanse) is great to have against a heavy CC team, and is probably the best of these three for lategame because getting cc'd means you're dying and your team is losing a huge amount of damage.
* [](/ghost) is awesome for a second escape and even better kiting than Ashe's typically extraordinary ability to do so. 
* [](/heal) for baits and staying alive. 

Skill order: WQWEWR or WEWQWR, max R-&gt;W-&gt;Q-&gt;E. W for damage, Q for infinite slow, E for vision. 

Item build: [](/bootsofspeed) + 3x [](/healthpotion) -&gt; 2x [](/doransblade) / [](/berserkersgreaves) / [](/vampiricscepter) -&gt; [](/bfsword) -&gt; [](/zeal) -&gt; [](/infinityedge) -&gt; [](/phantomdancer) -&gt; [](/thebloodthirster) / [](/lastwhisper) / defensive. [](/thebloodthirster) if the opposing team isn't building armor, [](/lastwhisper) if they are. Early [](/negatroncloak) if they're heavy on the magic damage (after [](/phantomdancer) works for this), finish your [](/quicksilversash) early if need be. If you're getting focused on the backline or if they don't have anything you'd need the active for, you can go [](/guardianangel) instead of [](/quicksilversash). I like building [](/zeal) before completing my [](/infinityedge) because the added attack speed combined with Q is really nice for any fight you might run into, as well as letting you chase better. Also this helps proc your [](/vampiricscepter) more for greater life steal in case you're in need of that earlier on.

General tips:

* Try to catch someone important with your arrow if at all possible. It's not going to be very helpful to your team to hit that Mundo with it. I know, easier said than done since you can't just choose who you hit, but if you can, try to make the best of your ability to aim skillshots.

* When in fights, alternate your Volley with autoattacks. It has more range than your aas so it's good for chasing, but you can exhaust your mana pool relatively quickly if you're not careful with it. Having Q on in fights is very handy as well because any slow on a target is a good thing.

* Remember your hawkshot. Doing dragon and don't have vision of the entrance to river from their wraiths? Hawkshot it. It's a very handy tool for giving vision while going for any objective or if you feel the need to check an area. Just be careful since it's on a minute-long cooldown, so try not to spam it.

* In lane, if you can hit the opponent with volley and then toggle on your Q and get off a few autoattacks, you are capable of chunking them pretty decently. Your burst isn't all that high, but Q is capable of making you incredibly frustrating to lane against since you're so hard to run away from.

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/sona  ""Sona"") **Sona, the Maven of the Strings**

Sona is a champion whose early game poke through her Hymn of Valor + Power Chord makes her a very potent support. She is pretty frail, but the overall utility of her Crescendo is almost unparalleled.

MASTERIES

0/9/21, taking standard ""sustain support"" utility, and armor/mr defensive masteries. If you feel like you can do without the additional defense, you could move the 9 defense into 9 offense, and get the 10% magic penetration.

RUNES

Most Sona players like to go with a standard mpen Mark Armor Seal Magic Resist Glyph and GP10 quintessences, but if you want to be super aggressive, you could potentially go Mpen reds, armor yellows, and AP glyphs/Quintessences.

SUMMONER SPELLS

[](/flash)  
[](/exhaust)[](/clairvoyance)[](/heal)

Flash is because you need to position yourself to get the crescendo off.

Exhaust is to secure kills for your AD carry, and to help peel.

Clairvoyance is if you don't feel like you can get kills, and for some reason you don't need exhaust.

Heal is if you don't want to be effective in killing, and want to be a sustain support.

SKILL ORDER

QWQEQR, then R&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E OR WQWEWR, R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E

Most of the time, you'll be maxing either Q or W first, leaving one point in E. This is due to how strong her poke is through Q, how her W can keep carries topped off in a lane, and the inability from E to boost the speed of her carry enough. The power chord-enhanced E does not improve with level, so only one point will do.

Which one you level up first depends on the lane you're up against. If its something along the lines of a kill lane (Corki Leona), you will want W over Q. If it's something along the lines of a sustain lane (Soraka), take Q over W.

ITEM BUILD

[](/faeriecharm)[](/sightward)**x4**[](/healthpotion)

You want to be able to ward up and get off those Qs. try to only go back once you can finish off your philo stone and pick up a few wards as well.

CORE BUILD

[](/philosophersstone)[](/heartofgold)[](/ionianbootsoflucidity)OR[](/bootsofmobility).

The logic behind this is that you want to be able to increase your gold income without csing, and gp/10 items are the way to do this. Any more than 2, and you're effectively gimping yourself. The boots depend on how well you're doing. If you think you can hold onto an oracle's elixir and roam, boots of mobility is the best option. If you don't feel like you're that far ahead, Boots of Lucidity are another option.

ADDITIONAL ITEMS

[](/shurelyasreverie)  - Builds out of Philosopher's Stone, and gives you CDR. The active is great for engaging or disengaging. I'd look to build this after the ""laning phase"" is effectively done, and everyone is grouping as 5.  
[](/aegisofthelegion)  - Great item and super cost effective. If your jungler isn't building this, build it.  
[](/locketoftheironsolari)  - Builds out of Heart of Gold, and gives your team a bit more effective hp. It isn't much, but its cheaper than the other option.  
[](/randuinsomen)  - Builds out of Heart of Gold, gives you a ton of armor, and makes AD carries less willing to focus you down. The active is great in team fights. I'd pick this up if I don't need the effective health from locket.  
[](/zekesherald)  - Great item. Gives you CDR, and it gives your AD carry more lifesteal and crit chance.

Feel free to answer any of these that you may know, don't feel obliged to answer them all!

-how do I deal with a tanky opponent that can kill me under a tower?
I love to play as nidalee, however several times even a max range spear is doing little damage. 


-jungling seems a very important aspect of the game however at the moment confuses the crap out of me. How does a jungler know which mobs to kill and when they have respawned? 

Also why are runes so crucial for a jungler?

Lastly, do all jungle monsters give buffs and if so can I ever kill the mobs for the buff or is that considered stealing it from the jungler?

-what determines the lane a champ should play in? I can only determine what lane I should be in when playing a new champion if I look up guides first however I'm unsure WHY I should be in that specific lane.

-when buying items I tend to follow a guide and buy the same items each game, however when watching live steamers they seem to buy items situationally. How can I learn to do this? 

-I can often be having a great game in my lane and find another lane is being pushed back and struggling. When I go to help I've lost towers in my own lane. How can I prevent this?

-As I mentioned earlier I love playing nidalee. Any general tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

-occasionally in lane I find myself 1v2 and pushed back to my tower in must of the early game, loosing CS and gold. I Understand it's important not to feed kills in this situation, however it puts you very far behind everyone else on the team. How do I deal with this situation?

New Tools:

I have been busy working on not only CS Calc updates, but also bringing you some brand-new tools!

**[Runepage Simulator](http://mullinator.com/tools/runepage)**

*Why use it?*

- Shows rune costs
- Shows total page costs
- Looks sexy
- You can add a full group of 9 runes *at once* (ctrl-click, riotpls)

**[Mastery Calculator](http://mullinator.com/tools/masteries)**

*Why use it?*

- Shows total stat effects
- You can fully increase/deplete a mastery point with *one click* (ctrl-click, riotpls)
- Looks DAMN sexy

Both of these tools feature unique URL generation, to make sharing your builds extroardinarily easy. (Albeit, the Runepage algorithm isn't fully beautified yet)

Mathematically, PD (when combined with IE, something I get on EVERY ADC I play) does more damage than SS, especially late game. They both require Zeal to build and the only advantage of SS seems to be its cheaper cost as the lightning only helps clear waves (something ADCs can do well naturally, especially with a couple items) and is negligible damage mid/late game with enemies building any type of hp or resistance gear.

Avarice blade has never impressed me, the only way to take advantage of the bonus gold is to seemingly hold off on building it into anything for a while after purchase, normally, only paying for itself which almost defeats the purpose of having it.

1367435031.0,22,self.summonerschool,1dhyvu,Daily LeagueTheoryCraft 101 #1. Trundle The Troll King,Slicksa,30,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1dhyvu/daily_leaguetheorycraft_101_1_trundle_the_troll/,"Hi guys today were gonna be theory crafting on our newly re-imagined champion [](/trundle) Trundle The Troll King.

With the tweaks to his kit our favorite troll has become an extremely strong pick for both the top lane and the jungle. His kit revolves around being able to drain the strength of his enemies and becoming a monster during teamfights. He excels at peeling for your squishy allies or just diving in with increased resistances to beat down their their carries. So lets look closely at his skills

King's TributeRANGE: 1000

Whenever an enemy unit near Trundle dies, he heals for 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6% of their maximum health.

A passive that doesn't really show much effectiveness but is still nice to have as it will help keep you alive during the laning phase or when your jungling. It may not show instant result but over time its very useful.

Q-Chomp COOLDOWN: 4COST: 30 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle enhances his next basic attack, dealing physical damage equal to a base amount plus a percentage of his attack damage and slowing its target by 75% for 0.1 seconds.
This attack increases Trundle's attack damage for 8 seconds, with his opponent losing half of this amount for the same duration.
PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+ 100 / 105 / 110 / 115 / 120% AD)
ATTACK DAMAGE BONUS: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40

As you can see Trundle's Q is a massive boost to your damage while taking AD away from them. The small slow on it is also a nice touch. With the prevalence of AD assasins such as **Kha'zix** and **Zed** the AD drain can be pretty helpful. Note the scaling AD ratio not bonus AD on this skill it allows you to raise your damage by quite a bit without building too much AD. It also makes him a great duelist as he will usually outdamage and outlive most matchups. **IMPORTANT** This is an auto attack reset so you can basically hit your opponent twice in one attack.

W-Frozen Kingdom RANGE: 900 COOLDOWN: 15 COST: 60 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle coats a target 1000-radius location with ice for 8 seconds, gaining bonus movement speed, attack speed, and increased healing and regeneration from all sources while he is on it.
MOVEMENT SPEED: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%
ATTACK SPEED: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80%
HEALING AND REGENERATION INCREASE: 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20% 

I really like his W as it has a lot of what Trundle needs in a fight: MS, AS and the healing increase is a nice bonus. Put this down and see your fighting ability skyrocket. With this you can go and rush their carries, be able to be the front line healing from your ultimate and lifesteal or be quick enough to run back and peel for your carry. Its extremely good for what it gives and its relatively low cost.

E-Pillar of Ice RANGE: 1000 COOLDOWN: 23 / 20 / 17 / 14 / 11 COST: 60 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle creates an icy pillar at a target location for 6 seconds, creating impassable terrain and slowing all enemy units around the pillar. Enemies caught in the center of the eruption are briefly knocked back.
The pillar blocks movement within 62.5 range, slows enemies within 187.5 range, and provides vision within 600 range.
SLOW: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%

One of the few skills that create impassible terrain in the game there is a reason that skills like this is few and far between as with proper use it can just destroy your opponents positioning and disrupt the enemy team with the pillar itself and the slow. Multipurpose as it can be used to split enemy divers from your carry with the pillar or use it for ganks and trap people in between the pillar and a wall. Its effectiveness increases with the less space the opponent has at it can block off jungle entrances and exit. A very strong skill that needs quick thinking and great decision making to maximize its effectiveness. 1000 range is pretty huge as well u can place it from one end of your Frozen Kingdom to the other.

R-Subjugate RANGE: 700 COOLDOWN: 80 / 70 / 60 COST: 75 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle drains a percentage of an enemy champion's health as magic damage and 40% of their armor and magic resist, half immediately and half over 4 seconds. The armor and magic resist bonus/reduction lasts for 4 after it has been fully applied.
INITIAL MAGIC DAMAGE: 10 / 12 / 14% (+ 1% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health
TOTAL MAGIC DAMAGE: 20 / 24 / 28% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health

Trundles ultimate Subjugate is an incredibly amazing skill with its draining of enemy health and resistances. See that Jax trying to dive into your carry BLAM now he has 20% less resistances then even more over 4 seconds making him so squishy that your carry should be able to take care of him easily. With increased resists you can then go into a team fight extremely beefy with your Q and W you will be outputting a large amount of damage making you a massive target for the enemy team. 

**Trundle in the Jungle**
Trundle now has higher sustain in the jungle with Frozen Kingdom if a creep dies while you have it up. His ganks are as strong as always with that Pillar of Ice and Frozen Kingdom preventing them from getting away. Trundle can be very strong as well even if you can't get too many ganks in as he needs very few items to be effective as he scales with his enemies as well. In my opinion one thing that Trundle excels at is counter ganks by splitting up their champions with his E taking their diver's health and resistances with his R while stealing their AD with his Q Chomp. Proper set up and vision will allow Trundle to be ready to wreck any aggression from the enemy.

**Trolling in Top Lane**
Trundle is very viable in the top lane right now, with the increased gold intake he can make more expensive items and be stronger throughout the game. With the many AD top laners in the game right now Trundle's Q will allow u to trade very effectively and his sustain from his passive now with some math. Melee minions have 445 health at the start and with 2% healing u get 8.9 health per creep so per wave 3 melee creeps result in 25 health and 280 health caster minions you get 5.6 so thats 16 health per wave so including your natural health regeneration thats at least 50 or 60 health per wave. You're also gonna find your W to be great to beat down your lane with shoving or with trading. With help from your jungler try to herd .them into the top wall and use your E to lock them in forcing them to flash or die.

**Tribute to The King, Building to Rule**
So what to buy on Trundle? Tanky or DPs? Trundle's ability to scale with his opponents allow him some lee way in what he should be building. As this is more of a theorycraft rather than a guide I'll point out more choice items.Some good items that should be considered are: 1. Blade of the Ruined King: This gives many stats that Trundle needs lifesteal, attack speed, damage and most of all that active. The passive also synergizes well with his W with 80% increased AS that damage is non-negligible Again going on the idea that Trundle scales with his foes this item should be highly considered on him. 2. Spirit Visage: A more obvious synergy with his passive to keep him high on health throughout a fight and I'm unsure if it stacks multiplicatively with is W or additively but its strengths make it a good pickup. 3. Triforce: everything in this item helps Trundle troll his way to victory he can use every stat on this item effectively.

**King of Clubs**
What to do during teamfights is what I see even before his rework many Trundle players fail to see. There are 3 main things that he can do. Peel, Dive and Tank. His use in each is dependent on what the team needs and his build dictates how well he can do in each. A Frozen Mallet Trundle can peel like no other weakening divers and blocking the enemy team from rushing in. Trundle with tenacity can go and rush carries easily while weakening their front lines resulting in your team able to follow up your dive faster. Tank Trundle with Warmogs can just live through anything while sustaining his health with his 20% increased healing and increased resistances. His versatility is great and while building onto one path he doesn't really lose his effectiveness to heavily in any other role.

**Winter and Trolling is Coming**
So overall I see Trundle being an extremely strong champion that will be an extremely powerful pick and could maybe see him in the pro scene very soon if they ever decide to change from their champion pool of 20-25 champs out of a 100+. He can wreck the prevalent AD assassin meta as well as the brutal bruiser champions that ruin the ADC's power. He is a viable champion in both the jungle and top lane however he will lose to ranged champions if he can't be aggressive. His gap closer suffers similarly to Skarner's gap closer in that its not a sudden movement and can be seen and prepared for. Many items that are popular are also very fitting to his kit and play style and overall he fits very well into the game.

1358896289.0,23,self.summonerschool,1733dl,Tumbling into a wall while against it greatly shortens the AA reset time. What other Vayne tricks have I been missing all my life?,Naonin,32,9,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1733dl/tumbling_into_a_wall_while_against_it_greatly/,"Tumbling into the corners at drag or baron makes for a fast clear. I use it to last hit under tower faster also. Trades, whatever, amazing new trick for me to practice that can make a huge difference.

I know OF things to do with condemn and flash but haven't mastered them. Obviously flash-condemn but what about condemn flash? I guess it does something nuts to condemn and the condemn bolt goes faster and a different direction? 

What about some kind of tumble condemn flash combo? 

I can't even imagine mixing my condemn into ult tumble flash crazy bonkers shit... Just teach me.


EDIT:

**Compiled list of *DropDizzle's* info/tips**

* Everyone who plays Vayne needs to learn this as a basic move: AA and when the bolt leaves her bow, Q and AA again for a perfect a-move execution, it resets the animation.

* By wall, AA-Q-AA for faster animation reset. AA-Q into wall-E (including the final AA that comes quickly after the E) can be the fastest silver bolt proc Vayne can do, also providing the knockback of stun, or just to disengage. Try this next time you are dove under tower.

* Condemn auto-attack. When condemn is finished casting and moving towards the enemy, the enemy is still in auto-attack range. You can then auto attack them immediately after casting condemn.

* Flash-condemn to gap close and secure a stun against wall when they over extend. After the stun is over you are already nearby and if they flash to escape you're Vayne, just chase them down.

* UNTESTED:  Condemn-flashing. This technique is very hard and requires precise timing. Immediately after casting condemn, you can flash to a new location, knocking the enemy back from your new position. This is much better than Flash-Condemn as it comes out much faster, without warning, can be used even if the enemy becomes hidden when you flash, and finishes quicker.

* I use Lifesteal Quints because that extra 6% is on average another 20-50 health gained per auto from mid-game on. (~250 AD, post BT, tumble damage helps too)

* Secure a win against MF or Draven by going 9/21 in masteries and starting cloth 5, even if you have a sustain support. The extra defense is amazing.

* Don't be afraid to use flash to dodge a skillshot CC, it can mean the difference between death and a double kill. I recently flashed a near point blank Lux snare while chasing Cait and secured the double. This was 13 minutes into the game and I was 0/1. It started a snowball that made me have ~13 kills and for a surrender near 30 min.

* THE ABSOLUTE BEST ADVICE I WAS EVER GIVEN THAT TURNED MY VAYNE PLAYING AROUND: ""Get in there, you're Vayne, you're not gonna die"" because up to that point I was always like ""shit can't get hit, gotta stay alive"" and overall backing out at half health. Now, If i have &gt;300 hp I'm fighting (depending on how bursty gap closing the team is)

* In teamfights, tumbling side to side is great, but an added effect is to tumble backwards, and run up to auto range, then tumble backwards again. Use this when the enemy has gap closers and your team has little CC. It has a psychological effect on the enemy, making them think you're further than you really are.

* In teamfights,like any ADC, show up late. For bonus effect, ult slightly late, about 3-4 seconds after initiation, giving you time to finish off the tank, and still chase down the rest of the team.

* Extended trading in lane can bait people into thinking they are going to kill you. Use AA-AA-Q(AA), then AA- AA- E. Deal enough to kill almost anyone. Specifically after Cait uses Q and her headshot, moving around Ezreals skillshots, Graves misses a buckshot, Corki Q is down, or any time the enemy fails at landing their damage skills/passives.

Based on the frequency of use as compared to the paultry 10 people who were kind enough to donate for the last upgrade (50 &gt;&gt;&gt; 100 person) and my diminishing presence in the community, I am going to probably not renew for a third year (2014-2015).

Things that I have been thinking about personally:

* Allowing regular users to add flair to their own posts

* Rework expandos on the sidebar or remove them entirely

* Making one post that contains every single icon and the command for it (this will take a long while)

* I really want to finish the light skin, but I have no motivation to. Can you guys motivate me/give ideas about it?

* We have quotes that pop up at random. GIVE ME SUGGESTIONS FOR MORE QUOTES, GUYS!

###Subreddit Traffic

**pageviews** are all hits to summonerschool, including both listing pages and comment pages.

**uniques** are the total number of unique visitors (IP and U/A combo) that generate the above pageviews. This is independent of whether or not they are logged in.

**subscriptions** is the number of new subscriptions in a given day that have been generated. This number is less accurate than the first two metrics, as, though we can track new subscriptions, we have no way to track unsubscriptions (which are when a subscription is actually deleted from the db).

I play primarily as an AD carry (varus), and if I can get a last hit on an enemy champion with my Q, I will take it regardless of if other champions are going for it.  When this happens, people will often passive aggressively call me out for KS'ing.   
  
The way that I see it is that if I can take the kill faster than they can (for instance, the enemy is fleeing and I have a large range), it both reduces the number of enemy champions on the field, as well as allowing my team to get into a better position to move on objectives.  Am I completely off base here?  I realize that this may not be the ""nicest"" thing to do, but personally, I have more fun winning a game than getting the most kills.  If I went 0/0/30 and my team won, I would consider it an excellent game.

This is NOT about taking cs from other lanes DURING lane phase.

So the friend who helped me learn how to play really stressed the importance of high cs. He even made a point of breaking it down and showing that being ahead by 30 cs = being head by 2 kills. When we started really playing together he would play AD and I would support. It was not uncommon after lane phase ended for me to see him take cs from every lane. He would normally be in team fights, however when we hit a lane he made sure he would last hit all the minions, holding back auto attack/abilities till he could finish them off. 

This didn't really bother me until I started playing rolls besides support. I started with AP carry and it was really annoying when we should show up into a lane and I would do something like drop Morgana pool to clear them. He would wait for a few seconds till they were all low health and then take them all. The result of this was me always being a bit under farmed while he was always very well farmed. The situation continued to get worse when I started jungling and I noticed how much he would take high yield creeps. I don't just mean taking wraiths while he was playing mid, I mean seeing me in the process of killing wraiths and sniping the big one as he ran by and saying ""dude, I almost have [*INSERT ITEM*] I need the gold."" 

As I have gotten better and actually been able to perform quite well in games (and even carry a couple, thanks SS!) I have started doing the same thing to SOME extent. I will never snipe jungle creeps but if there are 2-3 people pushing a lane I do my best to make sure I actually get all of the cs.

This has obviously infuriated my friend. He has actually raged ""get the fuck out my lane"" when I wait for him to volley a large creep wave then finish them all off myself (this is obviously in a situation where we need to push the lane a bit so minions are not on our tower, not just showing up in his lane and taking cs during lane phase).

I am really curious to get input from others. I have started solo queuing a bit more and don't want people raging at me because I ""stole farm"" the whole game, at the same time I don't want to be under farmed because I let everyone else take all the cs.

TL;DR CS, who gets it **post** lane phase? First to the wave? Whoever last hits it? AD/AP for extra farm? Person closest to their next item? Most under farmed?

EDIT: To be perfectly clear this question is NOT about lane phase. Obviously you should not show up in another persons lane and take cs. I am talking about when as a group you are pushing a lane. Should you hold your abilities and make an effort to get EVERY cs (and not push the lane as quickly) or just push hard and who gets the cs gets it. Keep in mind....in this situation the goal is to take a tower/push a lane so the enemy cannot take a tower w/o building up a wave. This has NOTHING to do with lane phase.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1341787554.0,,,True,t3_w4wg4,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/w4wg4/sharing_farm_cs/,

I just finished writing another [Quick](http://rtsgaming.org/category/leagueoflegends/quick-tip/) Tip for my website [RTSgaming.org](http://rtsgaming.org).  This tip is inspired by something I've seen happen more and more in games lately... people [trying to fight even when they are behind](http://rtsgaming.org/league-quick-tip-9-if-youre-behind-dont-try-to-fight-your-enemy/).  I mean, how many times have you had a teammate end up feeding because they think they can actually secure a kill against a laning opponent despite the fact that they have died in the last 2 attempts?  It's frustrating as a player to see a teammate do this and so I wanted to write this up to let people know that it's ok, and even smart, to play a bit defensively after you take a death in lane!

Hope you guys enjoy and as always I love to hear feedback from r/SummonerSchool so let me know what you think!

1340257179.0,23,self.summonerschool,vdb4p,Are they As Good As they Seem: Irelia,Philosiphicator,28,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/vdb4p/are_they_as_good_as_they_seem_irelia/,"I was thinking that this sort of thread might be used to highlight some of the pros and cons about a champion, the things that make them tick. Not so much a guide so much as things to keep in mind about the particular champ, what bases to cover, things like that. So I thought that I would start it off with my favorite champ.

**Please note: I am not ranked. I do not have an ELO score. I am by no means the best person on this subreddit to do this. Anyone else who feels they can do a better job, do so. I have been graciously informed that this post contains bad information, and as such, I will try to prune them out. If you really want to see what is going on,  check out the posts below.** With that out of the way, let's begin.

Irelia: My favorite lich. Also, probably the best looking one as well. She has an amazing kit going for her (hence the joke, ""Better nerf Irelia"".) Built in sustain that is *a flat amount rather than life steal* (which means that it works on towers as well) with true damage bundled in, a gap closer that can have an instant CD, a slow/stun based off of *percentage health* that can hurt, an ultimate that can keep you alive in a team fight where you are focused or to help heal while pushing that minion wave, and what might be the biggest boon to her: a passive that reduces **ALL** CC depending on the number of enemy champs near her.

Irelia is designed to be a Carry-Killer, an assassin but less burst-y, in my opinion. All of her kit is based around damage, gap closing, and survivability, which means that you, as Irelia, are expected to wade into the team fight, target their carry, or even bruiser (such as Darius) and crush them. Truthfully, assassins are all about the instant burst damage, and Irelia's burst is lacking in comparison to the other assassins. However, she earns the title by showing up and killing most everyone in a team fight short of a tank. Ok, so I am being hyperbolic there, but those of you who have played against an Irelia that is even moderately geared is a serious threat that should be addressed quickly. Again, there is a reason for the ""Better nerf Irelia"" joke.

Starting with her passive: If they CC you, and you can see them, you will break out of the CC faster than almost ANY other champ naturally **EXCEPT** for knock-ups/backs, though the stun at the end of any of them will be reduced, the knock itself will remain unaffected. Even fast with other enemy champs visible. This means that Morgana's stun, Lux's snare, Soraka's silence, all of it, are reduced in effectiveness, which means they have less of a lead to escape. Basically, this passive along with a pair of merc treads means their CC means very little to you. You would be stunned for all of .78 seconds, down from 2 seconds, with three enemy champs visible and a pair of merc treads. Watch them stun you, and then laugh as you grind them into the ground a second later with this passive.

Q: Her gap closer. Irelia will jump to the target, damaging them. This applies all on-hit abilities/buffs/etc. such as Red Buff, or Irelia's W, or Sheen, and is a great way to escape if the need arises. The damage on this skill scales well with her AD (1:1 ratio), so this skill can hurt, especially on champs that are generally flimsy such as Ashe or Cassiopeia. However, for having such a nice little list of benefits to it, it has a fairly long CD until the higher levels. UNLESS! If you score the kill with this skill, the CD is instant and the skill is back up again. This means that theoretically, this skill could be spammed as long as the skill is the killing blow to whatever the target is, minion or champ. The skill is expensive given Irelia's somewhat low mana pool, so spamming skills is not a good idea if you are not assassinating someone, but to not use this skill would be a waste if the opportunity to do so arose.

W: Her passive, her sustain, one of the things that makes her irritating to lane against. What this skill does is grants her a passive buff that heals her for a small flat amount for each hit she does. This buff does not go away when the skill is activated, and ultimately gives her beautiful sustain. Have you taken some damage from minions? Attack them, you will will heal for every attack. Attacking a tower? Same thing: towers will only make you stronger (but don't STAY under a tower if there is danger nearby, that would be stupid). And the active on this skill is very nice: it doubles the amount the passive heals (so 5/7/9/11/13 becomes 10/14/18/22/26), and adds flat true damage (15/30/45/60/75). One should always use this skill before they use their Q so that the Q applies the on-hit affects of the W (heal and true damage). This skill should be used when attacking your target (be it tower or champ), or for sustain when you don't quite need to recall and there is a handy minion wave nearby. Either way, the true damage will really come in handy (think of it like this: at level 5, getting  10 hits in is 750 TRUE damage. That is a lot of true damage). This is possibly Ireila's signature skill, the skill that every one knows her for. This is also the skill that had been nerfed, but fear not, Irelia players! What Riot did was reduce the passive bonus to what it is now from what the active bonus was. That is, the passive bonus now heals half of what it did before. This skill will be expensive early game (and is her cheapest skill mana-wise), but will be well worth it trading blows in lane or attacking your target. **When attacking your target, always make sure to have your W up.**

E: The stun/slow. This skill is the odd-skill-out as it does magic damge based on your AP rather than physical damage based on your AD. But other than that weird little attribute, it is going to be quite reliable. What it does is either slow down an enemy or completely stun them, both for two seconds. If they have a higher HP% than you, then you will stun them. Otherwise, they will be slowed by 60%. That's quite the slow. This skill is also expensive in terms of mana, so don't just be willy-nilly using it on everything. Also, it might sound weird, but don't be afraid to let them hit you first for the sole purpose of stunning them. Of course, try not to be killed, so, use caution/reason/common sense when letting them hit you. Also useful when chasing down escaping champs for obvious reasons (they will either be stunned or slowed).

R: Machine Gun Knives, but not really. This, her ultimate, is actually a very nice skill. What it does is deal AD/AP damage to all targets it hits (160 + .5 AP + .6 AD), and heals her for damage done (10% life steal from minions, 25% from champs) **each target hit**.  This skill is a pass-through linear skill shot pointing in the direction of the cursor, with Irelia as the anchor point. You point your cursor somewhere, push R, a blade goes flying in that direction and will not stop nor have reduced damage. The one real downside? It does not proc on-hit. Bummer, right? This ult should be used either to soften up a group of champs/minions (though it will nearly kill the minions from full health) or to heal/sustain. The skill is best fired into a group from reduced health to both heal and damage, though picking off hurting champs that are running away is not a bad use either if it nets you the kill. The skill costs 100 mana, and has a relatively short CD, so don't be afraid to pull this one out in every fight, though you should always be aware of your mana so that you have enough to pull off your other, more damaging skills (E, W, and Q, basically). As a rehash, this skill is like your W: deals nice damage, and will heal you nicely.

Unfortunately, I am not the best person to be suggesting builds, so I present to you the link to Wickd's own guide. [Enjoy](http://clgaming.net/guide/983-detailed-irelia-guide-wickd)

As for how to build Irelia, hink Olaf. You focus defensive tems. However, you should always build your defense to counter what the enemy team has. If the enemy team is AP heavy, or the main damage comes from AP, build against AP. Same for AD. Note, however, that if the team is balanced in how the AP/AD threat comes from, build according to the most dangerous champ on the field. Teemo's the biggest threat? Build against him. You have AP Kayle? You know what to do. You have a Tryndamere and a Lux that just hurt? Decide who is the bigger threat to your team and let them have it (be careful with Tryn though as he has Undying Rage = No Death, and may be built for tons of Life Steal. Actually, be very careful with Tryn. Go ahead and stomp all over Lux, though).

Irelia is very item dependent. You should not be too aggressive in lane, unless you can get the kill or can zone them out when it will not interfere with your farming. I am serious. Those builds I posted above? You'll need to farm ~16.5k gold to complete them. Yeah, that'll take a while. I focus on defense more than offense in fights, though I will finish offense first. Meaning, it would be more acceptable to be lacking in offense than in defense, though you really should have farmed enough to stay relevant, if you will. You should always be a serious threat to the carries, if for no other reason than that you can reach them, slow/stun them, and the rest of the team can kill them, though you should be doing the killing yourself at that point.

If you fall behind somehow, farm/assist (carefully!) in teamfights until you have decent gear again, though it may be too late at that point. Maybe not, each game is different.

Also, depending on what items you are taking, you can get gp5/10 items to assist in affording your gear, but don't break the build for them as they really aren't all that worth it otherwise. A heart of gold isn't bad, nor is a philosopher's stone, but...just remember, those items only sell for half value instead of three-quarter value.

Counters: Unfortunately, I do not have enough firsthand experience to help here. However, there are plenty of resources out there, especially here, /r/summonerschool

Note: Some people would argue that Irelia is still overpowered. I don't think so. Irelia is so item dependent that if you can keep her from getting her items, she will be a liability to her team like any other suppressed champ, except worse. She does not have much carry-through from her base stats for later in the game without items. She is designed to be a walking death machine, but that does **NOT** mean that she is overpowered. Similarly powerful is Teemo. A Teemo in a match-up means that the game will be hard, if the Teemo is decently skilled with that champ. He is all about the damage, like Twitch or Veigar, and that poison will get you. He is designed to be that way. And Teemo's flaw is that he is incredibly squishy. If he is kept in the open in a teamfight, there will be a nice soot stain where a Teemo used to be. Basically: A built Irelia is a happy Irelia. A starved Irelia is pathetic.

There's more, but I can't really think of anything at the moment...sorry for the wall of text!

1333863568.0,24,self.summonerschool,ryx95,The Cliff Notes: Counter-jungling.,,27,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/ryx95/the_cliff_notes_counterjungling/,"THE LINKS ARE BACK

So, counter-jungling. Before I dive into this post, I'm gonna split it up into three sections: buff stealing, camp stealing and Lv. 1 invades.

**Buff stealing.**

Now most of you should know that there are two neutral buffs in each jungle. These are the blue (golem) buff, which grants a huge amount of mana regen and CDR, and the red (lizard) buff, which gives you a slow on your autoattacks and a small DoT. These buffs are used for totally different things, with the red buff usually going to the jungler to aid in ganking whilst the second blue goes to the AP mid. But uses aside, they're both very valuable, and should be hung on to at all costs. But, even more rewarding is stealing the buffs in the enemy jungle, because not only does it give you the buff, but more importantly, denies the enemy their buff. 

So, what you need to know before you steal their buffs. Well, their first buff, I'm gonna cover in the 'Lv. 1 invades' section, but the buff that they started at will come up for the second time at roughly 7:20, and again at around 13:30. If you keep the timer on it, there's more of a chance that you'll be able to contest it and hopefully steal it. 

When should you steal buffs? Well, the main buff you should focus on stealing is blue, as its worth so damn much its insane. If you notice that they have a mid like Anivia or Swain, or a jungler like Olaf, Yi or Fizz, do your very best to steal it as they're all quite reliant on having that mana regen.

**Camp stealing**

In the current jungle, the vast majority of the rewards from camps have been put into the big creeps (blue wraith, blue wolf, big golem), so stealing these can really hurt the opposing jungler. Juiciest of all is the big wraith as its located closest to your jungle and has the least health out of all the large creeps. If you have a gap-closer or any ability capable of jumping over walls, performing this steal can be quite easy as the wall between wraiths and the river is jumpable by most skills.

**Lv. 1 invades**

The level one invade to contest their first buff can be greatly beneficial to your team whilst being just as detrimental to them. However, you're taking a bit of a risk going in to a level one teamfight, so you'll need to have a think about whether your team is likely to come out on top.

First, if you're gonna pull shenanigans like these, you *need* CV. Having vision of where they are at the time is paramount. Second, its great to have CC and a lot of early game damage. Janna is a very potent champion to invade with due to her tornado, Shyvana and Riven can put out a lot of damage, and Cass's output can be huge. Now, you should probably look at their jungler too to see what buff they are more reliant on. Amumu, for example, is a very common jungler, but he's so blue reliant it isn't even funny. Deny him his first blue and he's gonna have a hell of a hard time clearing with any sort of speed. Shyvana, however, is really reliant on having red buff to gank with any kind of effectiveness, so taking that red early can be really helpful.

Think that's it. On another note, the links to everything I've done prior are back down below :)

(First, I'll be streaming more lessons tomorrow morning, starting at 11:00 am EST. I'm planning on doing 3, but maybe more :D)

www.rakalakalili.com

Hi guys! You may have seen my posts about my lessons the last few days, where I watch and commentate a replay a viewer sends in. 

I've gotten a lot of positive feedback about what I'm doing, and I really like doing it! However, I felt it would be best to get some way to organize and structure what I do outside of reddit (plus I've been wanting an excuse to buy rakalakalili.com for awhile :P). 

I'll update the home section blog with my plans for streaming sessions and random thoughts. Some things to look forward to soon:

1) Guides! I'm planning on writing guides about things like: landing skillshots, laning, what to do in the mid game, etc Look for them soon.

2) Replay organization! I think right now I'm going to have a link to a google doc file that lists all the replays, the summoner name, elo, champion, position, and a link to the replay. So down the line, when I have something like 100 replays (I hope that happens :D), you can use that spreadsheet to sort for high elo mid games, or low elo kassadin games, etc, etc. I think this is going to be the easiest way to do that.

If you've been a fan of my videos so far, thanks for all of the support! Tell your friends, keep watching, subscribe on own3d, and help me improve by giving me some feedback about what I can do better!

Thanks a lot,

1376332108.0,24,self.summonerschool,1k809c,Some words of advice about warding when behind,favdulce,29,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1k809c/some_words_of_advice_about_warding_when_behind/,"Ok, late warding is an issue I've noticed an awful lot when playing with some lower elo friends. Basically, people tend to ward more when ahead or even, but have a tendency to severely cut back or stop when behind. This is understandable. The more control of the map your team has, the less risk there is to move past towers.

Truth is, warding becomes more important when you're behind, but the placement becomes less important. When you lose your towers and start losing control of the map, you lose the freedom to venture out and ward all the spots you normally would. Why is this? Simply because you are not as safe as before. Everyone has experienced trying to venture out and ward only to get completely wrecked. 

So here's my short piece of advice: when behind, ward on your way to your usual warding spots and drop wards when running away from somebody. Just because the ward cannot provide the ideal amount of vision or is not in the best of places does not mean you should hold it until you can ward your ideal spot. You may NEVER be able to venture out and ward where you want to past a certain point in the game, but for the love of all that is good, ward something. Even if you literally cannot walk outside the steps of your base, drop a ward over each of the big walls of the base.

But the Super Silly part still holds!

Basically, the SSSSSSSSSSS (type it by holding down 'S' for a while) is a weekly set of 1-3 scrims hosted by myself and Blanket Ninja that are intended to teach you something about League and entertain you, with a bit more emphasis on the second part.

Each week will feature a different theme! Players and viewers will have to learn how to play with crazy restrictions that range from only being able to use certain summoner spells, being only able to buy certain items (mass Shurelya's, anyone?), or only being able to pick certain champions. It should all result in hilariously entertaining games, and everyone will get to learn about and experience different niche items and strategies in a way that you'd very rarely get in to a normal game.

This week, the theme will be **everyone must run Clairvoyance, and no one may buy any wards or sightstones.  One member of each team may buy a Wriggles Lantern.**

Sign-ups are [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1w37_alz0Vylwx9hLM-Qc895nic5cMCxGvQMT-NNJ_qg/viewform).

The SSSSSSSSSSSSSS this week will be **Friday** at **8pm Pacific time** (tomorrow!).  I 100% guarantee that it will be at a different time next week, and probably will be a different time every week, so don't worry if you can't make it then!

Its INA Aurelius here again with another guide for my Tips for Success mini-guide series. Hope you all enjoy this guide, if have any opinions or comments below I encourage you to comment, for you're not only helping me, but helping everyone else as well! Thanks ahead!
 
**Backing Off**
 
One very common mistake that I see a lot when watching Lower ELO gameplay is that players do not know when to back off after:
 
 * Securing objectives, i.e. Dragon, Enemy Base Towers,  Enemy Inhibitors

&gt; Reasoning: After taking these objectives, especially after contesting for it wwith the enemy team, you all are generally weak and low on HP, so the most ideal moment is to back off, take your advantage and work from that. Gree will get you killed and you will lose your advantage if that happens. This is most prevalent after taking an enemy Inhibitor, for you are generally low on HP and if the enemy respawns in time, he/she'll have full HP to take your out and essentially clean-up.
 
 * Teamfights

&gt; Reasoning: Although very situational, that being, if some of the enemy team is still alive, i.e. No Ace was given, you should back off at that time. Use the advantage of a downed person to secure other objectives. 
 
 * Pushing lanes:

&gt; Reasoning: Again, although dependent on the positioning of the enemy team, staying too long just to get farm is not worth it if you die out of that decision. 
 
 * If an ally gets caught and dies.

&gt; Reasoning: Obvious one, with that you're down one ally and the enemy has an advantage over you. Break off the seige if this happens, before you are overwhelmed and Aced 

Hope you guys enjoyed today's mini-guide, as always feel free to comment below on what you think, or anything I could've gotten wrong. Tomorrow I wil post this months guide on How-To Tank, so hope you all are ready for that!

I went [21/9/0](http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#3SUq7agvMbpvEd), with LS quints, AS reds, Armor yellows and blues.

I asked for a good leach on the blue and my team gave it, along with the help on wolves. When I finished Blue, I was full HP. I rushed for my red buff, I soloed it and got away with full hp. I delayed the frozen domain to be sure the Lizard would die before it ended for the extra healing.

I could indefinitely stay in the jungle, without losing hp. It was a coop, so I got fed early, and backed to buy a cutlass and lvl1 boots. But if I wasn't fed, or if I just had on assist plus some lane tax, I could've bought another blade, boots, a ward and pots. As strong as a toplaner at that point of the game.

I wanna ask a question. Is there any con to this strat? What are your thoughts on this? Would you even try to go Ruby Crystal or Long Sword+2pots, for a faster build?

**Passive - Damnation**|Thresh does not gain armor per level. Instead, Thresh collects the souls of dead enemies by approaching them or by placing Dark Passage's lantern nearby. Souls permanently grant armor and ability power. Champions and large minions always drop a harvest-able soul. Small minions only sometimes drop a soul.A soul will only drop if the enemy unit dies within 1900 range of Thresh. Souls are visible to allies, and only become visible to enemies if the enemy team has vision of Thresh. Souls disappear if not picked up after 14 seconds.
:--|--:

**Abilities**

Death Sentence|ACTIVE: Thresh throws out his scythe to latch onto the first enemy hit for 1.5 seconds, dealing magic damage and stunning them for the same duration. During this time Thresh cannot attack but will tug on his chains twice over the duration, each time pulling the hooked unit a short distance towards himself.While a target is hooked, Thresh can reactivate this ability to pull himself to the bound enemy. This removes the stun but allows Thresh to attack again.

**Cost(Mana)**|80 / 80 / 80 / 80 / 80
**Cooldown**|18 / 16.5 / 15 / 13.5 / 12
**Range**|1075

Dark Passage|ACTIVE: Thresh throws his lantern to the target location, which remains there for up to 6 seconds. If an ally right-clicks it, they pick up the lantern and Thresh pulls them both back to his own location. If Thresh moves more than ~1500 units away, the lantern will return to him.For the next 6 seconds, allies who come near the lantern (even while Thresh is holding it) gain a shield that absorbs damage for up to 4 seconds. Allies can only receive the shield once per cast.

**Cost(Mana)**|50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70
**Cooldown**|22 / 20.5 / 19 / 17.5 / 16
**Range**|950

Flay|PASSIVE: Thresh's basic attacks deal bonus magic damage on each hit. This value is equal to the total number of souls collected, plus a percentage of his attack damage based on the amount of time since his last attack.ACTIVE: Thresh sweeps his chain in a broad line towards a target direction. Enemies hit take magic damage, are knocked in the same direction as the chains, and are slowed afterwards for 1.5 seconds.
:--|--:
**Status Effect(Slow)**|20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%

**Cost(Mana)**|60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80
**Cooldown**|9 / 9 / 9 / 9 / 9
**Range**|400(800)

The Box|ACTIVE: Thresh summons 5 spectral walls around him that last up to 5 seconds. Enemies that touch a wall take magic damage and are slowed by 99% for 2 seconds, but break the wall. Once one wall is broken, the remaining walls deal half damage and apply half the slow duration. An enemy can be affected by multiple walls.

* A gank is not only successful if there is a kill -- If The jungler comes in, and the enemy uses his summoners or his ult, that gives you a HUGE advantage in lane
* Every time a jungler comes and waits for a gank that jungler is missing out on farm-- so when they leave, don't get mad, and when they take some minion kills, understand they are just trying to stay in the game
* Make sure you know where your jungler is before you ask for a gank-- If the jungler is close, only ask if the gank set up is about to happen, if they are far away, make sure you give them time to get to you
* If your lane opponents use their summoners/ults, tell your jungler, he can use that information to help set up a gank in the near future.
* if you use your summoners/ults, tell your junglers so he doesn't assume you have them up
* If you are losing lane a little bit, tell your jungler-- a well timed gank early on can save a losing lane, but the jungler needs to know what is happening in order to do it in time.
* If your lane is BADLY lost, do not ask for a gank-- This is not to be mean, but if you cannot trade evenly with your lane opponent(s) then the jungler is just coming in to die.  Help by telling him you are losing lane and farm up. 
* if you get ahead feel free to roam and gank yourself-- just let your jungler know so you can coordinate ganks or he can farm your lane.
* If your jungler just walks into lane, don't assume it's a terrible gank-- good junglers will just show themselves sometimes to help allievate pressure from your lane

* LAST BUT NOT LEAST if your jungler pings for a gank, and you aren't able to follow through, say so IMMEDIATELY, that way no time is wasted and terrible ganks can be averted

Then when she returned to lane, like say 13 mins in game, she bought the warmogs components, and had only AP from runes (23).
Needless to say, her hp bar was pretty big, and damage was quite normal.

1360879333.0,24,self.summonerschool,18jiv0,A bit of support advice regarding warding in the early game:,MedalsNScars,28,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18jiv0/a_bit_of_support_advice_regarding_warding_in_the/,"There are 4 key spots to ward in the early game:

1. Blue side tri-brush

2. Dragon

3+4. Both lane brushes

Typically you'll want to ward based on how pushed the lane is.

For blue side:

If you're at your turret have wards at Tri brush and near lane brush.

If you're mid-lane, ideally you have wards in far lane brush, tri brush, and on dragon.

If you're pushed to their turret, keep drag warded, and instead of your tri brush, try to get the entrance to your jungle near mid warded. If you just have tri warded you won't have time to react to ganks from it.

Purple side:

At your turret, your lane brush, dragon

Mid way, their lane brush, dragon, tri.

At their turret, tri brush, dragon.

Now that the basic locations of ideal wards are, you also want to know when and where to pink. This is a little more complicated but not too bad.

1. If they have a support that harasses (Zyra, lulu), start with a pink. Use it to clear the ward they put in your lane brush. IMPORTANT NOTE: Check their inventory to see if they started with an explorer ward. If they did, don't waste your pink on it. Wait until they re-ward and clear that out.

2. If your opponent pinks a strategic location (tri, dragon), buy a pink to clear it out. Only try to clear it out if you know you can do it safely. Nothing worse than having to back off and let them clear your pink.

3. If you have a pink and a sightstone and your opponent has a pink, if it's safe to do so, walk up to dragon and walk back. Your opponent will think you place a sightstone ward and go to pink it when they can. Congratulations, you just made them waste a pink, since you can now clear it.

Disclaimer: The above trick doesn't work if they have it warded and are attentive enough to see that you didn't ward. A way around this is to stand in one spot for about 3 to 5 seconds. If you had warded where you were standing they wouldn't be able to see it behind your icon.

That's about all I can think of right now for early game warding. Mid-late game warding gets a lot more complicated based on generally how the game is going, but overall you want to try to keep dragon and baron warded if it's safe to.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,t3_18jiv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18jiv0/a_bit_of_support_advice_regarding_warding_in_the/,

This whole thinking came in consequance of a game yesterday and a mad Akali acusing me of killstealing. Basically I was mid, trying Malzahar against a Katarina and was ganked by Nunu. Akali came to help and started to attack Katarina, which also attacked and Âkali's life started to drop, so I decided to attack Katarina, ending up in killing her.

1355444657.0,24,self.summonerschool,14tcvd,How to get a succesfull gank in your own lane and help your jungler set up the kill!,Rastamus,28,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/14tcvd/how_to_get_a_succesfull_gank_in_your_own_lane_and/,"Hello there, this is my first post on the subreddit, and i must admit that i am writing this mostly out of frustration on the issue. I want to give some of the new guys some advice on how to help your jungler get a good gank in your lane, and how to set up the lane to make it easier. A lot of this involves getting the enemy to think he has the upper hand, and make him go all in when in fact you are just baiting him. This means you want to do these things in the mindset of the enemy, think as they would and make them do what you want.

- Tell your jungler when he can gank and get a kill, don't just ask out of frustration that you are losing lane.

This means that you should do some preparation to before the gank. a shyvana forexample wont be able to gank mid lane very well if the lane is pushed towards their tower. So what you need to do is to make sure the lane is in a proper spot, you can do this in a few ways.

1 - by shoving fast(anivia, karthus, tf and other hard aoe champs) and all the way to the tower. This way their tower will kill the lane, and their minions will start moving towards your side  of the map, opening them up for a gank. It may take a few minutes to do it before the lane has been reset so the minions are in the middle of the lane again, so don't do this right before the gank, do it in good time to avoid having the jungler come up to your lane when minions are under tower.

2 - If the enemy is a champ like karthus, or tristana or something that automaticly pushes more than just lasthitting with AA, then you can get them to push the lane themself by just taking it easy and lasthitting with AA yourself. 

*Before setting the lane up for the kill, you can tell your jungle to come to lane in x mins, and where he can easily gank from.*

I also said that you should not ""ask out of frustration that you are losing the lane"" this is because that far too often i will see a lane spamming for someone to gank their lane, when they are in fact already at 20% hp, no mana, and has no cc to help you out. Instead of doing this, ask the jungler to hold your lane, or just recall without, and ask them to gank when you get back to the lane. This way you wont have you or the jungler die, expecting you to be able to help him out on the gank.



Those were ways to put the enemy in a position open to a gank, now on how to make the enemy put himself into a position open to a gank!


- When the jungler is about to gank the lane, try to play mindgames with the opponent and make them make a wrong step.

This is because that some champions will simply just jump away when they see the gank comming, this will just result in your jungler wasting time comming to the lane.

To avoid this, you can make them think they caught you making a bad step, then you turn and slap them in the face. In lane, the time when people go in for a trade is when the enemy steps into a bad spot, you want to make them think you just made a bad step, you want to get them into a position that makes them voulnerable to a gank. Examples could be:

1 - Stuns: The enemy has a skillshot stun, that can be used to stop the jungler when they run out of the brush ready to attack. Here you can bait the spell by discretely standing out of the cover of minions, make sure to make it DISCRETE, make it look like a mistake. Then when they shoot it, you dodge, ping and go in for the kill. Your jungler will now be able to rush the target instead of having to dodge a morgana binding on the way.

2 - Leaps: If the enemy has a jump, or leap of some sort that they use to engage with, you want to bait this out too. This can be champs like Ezreal, akali, diana or jax. These champs can use the leap to avoid the jungle gank. Get them to jump closer to your side of the map, making them more open to ganks. To do this you need to know the approx range of the leap, and put yourself in a position where you, in the mindset of the enemy, would have attacked all in. Then the instant they jump you, the jungler will come in from behind and you can kill him together without having to worry about them jumping merrily away.

*For all of the above tactics where you get them to attack you, for god sake, be sure they can't kill you before the jungler gets there. But if you or the jungler gets killed, and you still kill them, it was most likely worth it! An assist is 58% more gold to the team.*

- Zone the enemy!
If you want the enemy to get in a position closer to your jungler, move to the opposite side of the lane and shoot something towards them. This way you force them to move down/up and cover behind minions, this way you can guide them into the grasp of your jungler in the brush he just walked closer to.

Example for mid lane is if i want the enemy karthus to get closer to jax in top river brush. i then move down below my minions, and shoot something towards the enemy, they will want to hide behind minions, and are forced to go upwards. When they do that, jax jumps out and stuns them, allowing for a quick and easy gank.


 - And to end it of i want to just give some good tips on how to keep the lane more gank friendly.

1 - Keep an eye on the enemy wards. Did they just ward the tribrush, Tell the team with a ping and shouting ""Ward!"".
If you don't know if the enemy has placed any wards, keep an eye on his inventory when he comes into lane, make note on his amount of wards and every time he leaves, and comes back to lane, see if that number has changed. If it went 1 down, he just warded somewhere from where he came from, you can often guess exactly where.

2 - Keep a note on when he warded, and when the ward runs out. The timer on wards are 3 mins.

3 - Pink ward a side of you lane if you want that side to be open for the jungler to gank, this way you know when they have wards, and you can clear them out if you want to. 

4 - Keep an eye on the enemy jungler, nothing sucks more than getting a good gank going, just to get double killed by the enemy jungler.

Ever since the previous head of staff for SummonerSchool Team Battles has become too preoccupied with other things, SSTB has been in a state of disrepair. I am here to change that, with this reboot of the idea from forever ago.

___
***WHAT IS SSTB?***
___

SummonerSchool Team Battles (SSTB) is a place for players to take the next step, and form a team in order to achieve more long-term goals, such as accomplishing detailed team compositions, communication, and just improving as a team.

___
***WHO'S IN CHARGE?***
___

Me of course! But I do have willing ~~slaves~~ staff to help me out; I can't  be everywhere.

List of SummonerSchool Team Battles Staff:

 * [Kuenaimaku](http://www.reddit.com/u/kuenaimaku)

***WHAT'S THE POINT?***
___

The whole point of SummonerSchool is to improve your mechanics, champion skill level, and knowledge. This is the next natural step -- the ability to play a role to success in a competitive environment. SSTB will enable teams to find scrims easier, and possibly later down the line, SSTB will be used as a springboard for mini-tournaments, with possible prizes. 

___

***GUIDELINES***
___

Once your team has been approved, you can check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoWEewrL55RDdGs2OVJfd1VMVnBfRkVMTS14dlZOdWc#gid=1) to make sure your information is correct. If it's not, message a staff member with the changes, and we'll get it sorted out.
&gt; If you were found through the Looking For Team spreadsheet, contact a SSTB Staff member to inform them of it, so we can remove you from the spreadsheet.

The team who initiates the scrim arrangement will be held accountable for filling out the Activity Tracker at the end of the set.
&gt; The [activity tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHZiLWl0TklTSlV4Z0pYd01nUzdXOUE6MQ#gid=0) is a required form to be filled out. It makes checking up on teams easier for SSTB Staff, so please comply. 

Scrims do NOT have to be shoutcasted -- it is a bonus tool for teams, and it allows shoutcasters to practice their skills.

___
***RULES***
___

* Do not be rude to other participants/teams.

* All registered teams must play at least 1 set every 2 weeks.

* Be on time -- wasting someone's time is rude.

* Do not post on the subreddit about your SSTB team. There will be a time and place for this.

* Do not give the SSTB staff the run-around.

* Have fun!

*failure to comply with these simple instructions will result in your team being removed from SSTB, and a temporary blacklist of the offender from SSTB in itself.*

___
***FAQ***
___

**What server is this featured on?**  
&gt;North America (NA). We may branch out to other servers once this reboot proves successful.

**Is there a cap on elo?**  
&gt;No. But in the cases of impromptu tournaments from SSTB teams, there will be an average elo range for that tournament. Otherwise, have fun!

**How do I get in contact with a Team?**  
&gt;Usually the first player on the team is the ""Team Captain"". Contact them and set up a time for a scrim.

**How do I know if a team is active?**  
&gt;Any teams listed will have at least played another team within a few weeks. 

**Do we report scrim results?**  
&gt;Yes! the team that initiated the scrim set-up is required to fill out the activity tracker.

**Is a shoutcaster required for a scrim?**  
&gt;No. But, its better to have one so that you can have a third party that can give both teams advice on more meta aspects. It also allows for shoutcasters to get some experience under their belt, too!

**How do we know if our team is accepted?**
&gt;It will be listed in the ""Accepted Teams"" sheet, and the ""Team Captain"" will be notified on Reddit.

**How do we report offensive behavior?**

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/ashe ""Ashe"") **Ashe, the Frost Archer**  


Best kiting champion in the game. One of the best initiate abilities there is. Decent damage with incredibly good sustained DPS over the course of a fight. One of the single best carries to learn positioning with because she's autoattack dependent rather than ability dependent. Best champion to learn to kite with as well as chase with thanks to her infinite slow.

Masteries: 21/0/9, standard AD.

Runes: 9x flat AD reds, 9x flat armor yellows, 9x MR/level blues, 3x flat AD quints. Standard AD to prioritize last hitting, taking as little harass as possible, and having better MR for lategame.

Summoners: [](/flash) and any of: [](/heal), [](/ghost), [](/cleanse). The second depends on your playstyle and what you find works best. 

* [](/cleanse) is great to have against a heavy CC team, and is probably the best of these three for lategame because getting cc'd means you're dying and your team is losing a huge amount of damage.
* [](/ghost) is awesome for a second escape and even better kiting than Ashe's typically extraordinary ability to do so. 
* [](/heal) for baits and staying alive. 

Skill order: WQWEWR or WEWQWR, max R-&gt;W-&gt;Q-&gt;E. W for damage, Q for infinite slow, E for vision. 

Item build: [](/bootsofspeed) + 3x [](/healthpotion) -&gt; 2x [](/doransblade) / [](/berserkersgreaves) / [](/vampiricscepter) -&gt; [](/bfsword) -&gt; [](/zeal) -&gt; [](/infinityedge) -&gt; [](/phantomdancer) -&gt; [](/thebloodthirster) / [](/lastwhisper) / defensive. 

[](/thebloodthirster) if the opposing team isn't building armor.

[](/lastwhisper) if they are.

Early [](/negatroncloak) if they're heavy on the magic damage (after [](/phantomdancer) works for this), finish your [](/quicksilversash) early if need be. If you're getting focused on the backline or if they don't have anything you'd need the active for, you can go [](/guardianangel) instead of [](/quicksilversash). 

I like building [](/zeal) before completing my [](/infinityedge) because the added attack speed combined with Q is really nice for any fight you might run into, as well as letting you chase better. Also this helps proc your [](/vampiricscepter) more for greater life steal in case you're in need of that earlier on.

General tips:

* Try to catch someone important with your arrow if at all possible. It's not going to be very helpful to your team to hit that Mundo with it. I know, easier said than done since you can't just choose who you hit, but if you can, try to make the best of your ability to aim skillshots.

* When in fights, alternate your Volley with autoattacks. It has more range than your aas so it's good for chasing, but you can exhaust your mana pool relatively quickly if you're not careful with it. Having Q on in fights is very handy as well because any slow on a target is a good thing.

* Remember your hawkshot. Doing dragon and don't have vision of the entrance to river from their wraiths? Hawkshot it. It's a very handy tool for giving vision while going for any objective or if you feel the need to check an area. Just be careful since it's on a minute-long cooldown, so try not to spam it.

* In lane, if you can hit the opponent with volley and then toggle on your Q and get off a few autoattacks, you are capable of chunking them pretty decently. Your burst isn't all that high, but Q is capable of making you incredibly frustrating to lane against since you're so hard to run away from.

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/blitzcrank ""Blitzcrank"") **Blitzcrank, the Steam Golem**  


Blitzcrank! My all-time favourite support. Blitz doesn't have much of what most other supports have; he has no heal and no buff for his ADC. All [](/blitzcrank) has is godlike initiation. Landing a Rocket Grab can turn a game around completely, and this makes him a powerful support into late game if you can land that skillshot.

Rocket Grab is a line skillshot that pulls the first enemy hit towards Blitzcrank. It has very long range and stuns the target as they travel. This is the cornerstone of Blitzcrank. Learn to land your hooks. I would really recommend trying him out in a bot game or two first, and just trying to catch enemies with your hook. Landing your Q reliably is the difference between a good Blitz and a useless Blitz. There isn't much in between. 

Skill order Q E W Q then Q&gt;W&gt;E&gt;R, reason being that you want the reduced CD on hook, and hook scales better with levels. W also helps you do more damage and stay more mobile. R is really powerful, a 500 damage AoE nuke + silence on a low cooldown is brutal.

Fairly standard support runes/masteries. If I want the early game burst I have been known to grab magic pen in offense, but other masteries are better mid/late game. Runes either GP10 or MS quints, armor yellows and reds, MR/Level blues. MS is really strong on Blitz because it lets you close the range for your grab just enough in so many situations.

Build wise, I usually start boots ward pot, then into HoG or Philo depending on the lane. Lots of poke = philo, lots of burst = HoG. HoG fits in better with Blitz's bursty nature. You can get one or both, it depends on how well you are doing in lane. Both Shurelya's and Randuin's are solid items on him, so they aren't useless to you. If you are doing well in lane, a Sheen can really help you snowball the lane, but I would advise against it if you are losing. 

After that, just whatever you need really. Get Shurelya's if you need HP, Randuins for armor, Negatron should be fine for MR but you can go into FoN if you can afford it. TriForce really helps him dish out some damage, but you would only get this in games where you are really far ahead.

Late game you are the initiator for your team. Ward up, try and catch someone off guard. A carry is perfect, but often the support or jungler will do as well. If they enemy engages, you have really good peel or dive, depending on what your team needs. Power fist makes it impossible to miss hook, so you can tie up bruisers for a little while. His ulti is great against a lot of mids, and basically hard counters Katarina. 

Practice the hooks. Believe in the fist. Every time you hook there will be a glorious moment of anticipation, where you aren't sure if the enemy Sona will walk into it or not, and then she does and it feels good. One of the most satisfying skills to use. Landing good hooks, especially blind into the fog of war will make you look like a badass too. This comes with lots of practice.

Blitz is banned a lot in draft because of how easy it is for him to win matches, so you might want to stick to blinds to get him regularly.

Very strong champion, incredibly safe in lane, nearly immune to ganks because of her Black Shield. Farms very easily with Tormented Soil. Incredible teamfight presence with Soul Shackles + Zhonya's Hourglass. Great engage / anti-chase tool with Dark Binding. Not the burstiest of champs, but you can do some harassing and get easy kills if your lane opponent lets you.

Summoners: Ignite/Flash, should be pretty self-explanatory.

Masteries: 21/0/9, standard AP with points in AD in the Offense tree for easier last hitting.

Runes: MPen reds, mana regen/5 or armor yellows, scaling AP or flat MR blues, flat AP quints. Best bang for your buck, yellows and blues depend on your lane opponent.

Passive: Soul Siphon - 10/20/30% spell vamp when using abilities. Makes her a pain in the ass to lane against.

Q: Dark Binding. Does good damage, snares for 3 seconds at max level, 90% AP scaling. Incredible engage, lets you do very good harass pre-6 if you can Q-&gt;W-&gt;autoattack, allows for kills once you hit level 6.

W: Tormented Soil. AoE damage, allows for essentially free farming and does pretty respectable damage over time.

E: Black Shield. Every jungler's nightmare. Absorbs magic damage and blocks CC. Remember that it doesn't block physical damage, so AD carries can still maul you through it.

R: Soul Shackles. Nice little spell. Does damage while casted as well as slowing its targets with a stun at the end. Flashing into fights to use this on everyone will allow you to do very good team-wide damage, and anyone who doesn't escape before the stun hits is in for a world of hurt.

Skill build: QWWEWR, max R-&gt;W-&gt;Q-&gt;E.

Item build:

Boots+pots start -&gt; 2x Doran's Ring -&gt; Zhonya's -&gt; Deathcap -&gt; situational. The only time I wouldn't start Zhonya's is if you're sure there won't be any teamfighting, in which case you can maximize early damage by going DCap. Otherwise, Hourglass lets you flash ulti into fights then use the active to survive. Lategame possibilities: Void Staff, WotA for ridiculous spellvamp, DFG if you want that bit of burst.

Remember to push and roam whenever you can, Morgana is amazing at that because she clears minion waves at level 3 of W. Flash -&gt; ulti -&gt; Q is a nice combo if your lane opponent has their flash down. As long as your Black Shield doesn't get baited out, you're essentially ungankable.

Riven is built as a strong hypercarry or tanky DPS in the top lane or the jungle. She is very mobile with her skills, and becomes a very tanky threat later in the game, as well as having an amazing scaling and amazing steroid. However, CC will shut her down quite fast as she will not be able to combo her skills fast enough.

Runes:

* Marks: Flat AD or Armor Pen

* Seals: Flat Armor

* Blues : Flat/Scaling MR or Flat/Scaling CDR

* Quints: Flat AD

Masteries: http://solomid.net/masteries.php#1300430410010030101304001000000000000000000000000

Summoners: Flash/Ignite

For skilling, get one level in each spell from levels 1-3. Get R whenever possible, and max W first, but feel free to put points in E if you need a stronger shield from harass early game. After that max either Q for damage or E for tankiness. E is a hard-scaling shield. A general build is to go Boots + 3 Pots, then Double Dorans into a Bloodthirster. From there, get Guardian Angel and Last Whisper/Frozen Mallet, and whatever tankiness items you need. In the laning phase try to last hit, but you can go all-in on certain champions at level 1, you do a ton of damage throughout the laning phase but can be caught in a compromising situation extremely quickly.

Quick Tips:

* Riven gains damage from autoattacking in between her skills, because of her passive steroid.

* Her third Q proc will slightly knockback someone, and can cancel channels and easily peel.

* Having her ult up increases her AD, giving bonus shield and increasing the range on her skills, which allow her to do more AoE damage with Q and W. Wind Slash can be used as a finisher or just pure AoE damage into 5 enemies.

Singed is the most badass champion in the game. No exceptions. Now to play Singed, first you must acquire balls-deep syndrome, from level 4 onward. Counter-jungle, dive, fling people, don't give a fuck. You're Singed. Start with boots and 3 pots. No exceptions. Pick up an early Philosopher's Stone, which allows you to keep your Q on forever, and health regen is OP. Also get HoG, because you need dat dough. If you have massive balls, get Kage's and Avarice Blade you carzy motherfucker. Next up is your Glacial Shroud into Frozen Heart, if you've already flung bitches and have 938473947 farm by 10 minutes, buy Rod of Ages for maximum DPS. Now at this point, just run into the enemy team, and give no fucks. Get Merc Treads also. Then get a Rylai's for maximum slow power. And then upgrade Philo's and HoG into Shurelya's or THE MOTHERFUCKING MIRACLE YEAH, and Randuin's. Also buy some other shit and fling shit and walk into the team, call the cops see if I care.

1348338685.0,25,self.summonerschool,10b2b8,[Math] When to buy Banshee's Veil versus Force of Nature for tanking magic damage,lustigjh,30,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/10b2b8/math_when_to_buy_banshees_veil_versus_force_of/,"**Why make this comparison?**

While Force of Nature gives the most straight magic resistance, Banshee's Veil gives a large amount of magic resistance *in addition to* health, meaning that at lower max health, Banshee's Veil actually gives you more capability to tank magic damage.  This guide aims to show the point at which Force of Nature becomes the better item for tanking magic damage.  To make things more objective and straightforward, I have ignored any bonuses from the two items besides pure defensive stats.

Here are some abbreviations I will use and their definitions:

- BV: Banshee's Veil

- CE: Cost efficiency (a measure of how expensive an item's stats are in units of stat/gold)

- Eh: Effective health (an averaging of the next two terms aimed at approximating the total amount of damage you can tank)

- Emh: Effective magic health (this is the actual amount of magic damage required to kill you)

- Eph: Effective physical health (this is the actual amount of physical damage required to kill you)

- FoN: Force of Nature

- H: Max health (for the sake of this post, we'll assume this to be at level 18, without taking the potential bonus health from BV into account)

- MR: Magic resistance

I have divided this guide into four sections to cover four different scenarios that might matter:

1. When looking solely to gain the most Emh, regardless of cost

2. When looking to get the most Emh out of your gold

3. When looking solely to gain the most Eh regardless of cost through one of these items

4. When looking to get the most Eh out of your gold through one of these items

On to the math and the questions at hand:

**If I want to tank as much magic damage as possible, when should I buy FoN instead of BV?**

The formula for Emh is as follows:

Emh = H(1 + MR/100)

Since FoN gives 76 magic resistance but no health, FoN's Emh as a function of H is as follows:

Emh = H(1 + 76/100) = 1.76H

Since Banshee's Veil gives health and magic resistance, its formula is a bit different:

Emh = (H + 375)(1 + 50/100) = 1.5H + 562.5

To find the point at which the two items give the same amount of Emh, we set the two formulas equal to each other and solve for H:

1.76H = 1.5H + 562.5

H = 2163.46

So, if your max health is going to be above 2163, building a FoN will allow you to tank more magic damage.

**If I'm only concerned with building magic resistance, but want to get the most stats out of my money, when should I get FoN instead of BV?**

The answer to this question is found by dividing the formulas from the previous section by their respective item costs, shown as C, to give:

CE = [H(1 + MR/100)]/C

Again trying to find the point at which FoN is a better choice:

(1.76H)/2610 = (1.5H + 562.5)/2715

H = 1700.40

Since only a very small handful of champs have a base maximum health of less than 1700 at level 18 and since none of those champions benefit from building tankiness over damage, a Force of Nature is always the most cost-effective way to tank as much magic damage as possible.  In other words, if your maximum health is between 1700 and 2613, BV gives you more Emh but each point of Emh will cost more than it would have if a FoN was purchased.

**Since BV gives health, it also increases my Eph, even without bonus armor stats.  If I want to take both the Emh and Eph offered by each item into consideration and buy the item that provides the most overall tankiness, when should I buy FoN?**

This section is a bit less accurate because we have to assume the damage output by the enemy is perfectly mixed between both physical and magic damage, which is almost never the case.  Regardless, the max health threshold for this situation can still be useful to know so I will present my calculations anyway.  Here is the formula for finding Eh (total effective health, an average of Emh and Eph):

Eh = .5[H(1 + MR/100) + H(1 + Armor/100)]

Eh = .5H[2 + (MR + Armor)/100]

By solving for H in the same manner as above, we find:

H = 3605.77

This means that at a max health of more than 3605, FoN will be more likely to provide you with more overall tankiness since the small Eph bonus from BV is negligible.

**If I want to take both the Emh and Eph offered by each item into consideration along with cost and buy the item that provides the most cost-effective overall tankiness, when should I buy FoN?**

Dividing both sides of the previous equations by item cost gives the following answer:

H = 2526.70

So, if your max health is between 2527 and 3606, a BV will still provide you with the most overall tankiness but each point of Eh will cost more than it would have if a FoN was purchased instead.  It will be more cost-effective to buy a FoN if your health is above 2526.

**TL;DR/Summary:**

When to buy each item depends on your max health. So:

1. If you want to tank as much magic damage as possible, regardless of cost, buy a Force of Nature if your max health (without item) is going to be greater than 2163.  If your health will be lower than 2163, buy a Banshee's Veil.

2. If you want to tank as much magic damage as possible but only want to buy the cheapest stats, buy a Force of Nature if your max health (without item) is going to be greater than 1700.  If your health will be lower than or equal to 1700, buy a Banshee's Veil.

3. If you want the most overall tankiness from your item, regardless of cost, buy a Force of Nature if your max health (without item) will be greater than 3605.  If your health will be lower than or equal to 3605, buy a Banshee's Veil.

4. If you want the most overall tankiness from your item but only want to buy the cheapest stats, buy a Force of Nature if your max health (without item) is going to be greater than 2526.  If your health will be lower than or equal to 2526, buy a Banshee's Veil.

Keep in mind that the max health (H) you should consider will be your max health when you need the item in question, so you will need to know ahead of time what your max health will be during team fights or other engagements (this is why I assumed level 18 for simplicity).  Do not add the health bonus of the BV to this number when considering the above conditions - it has been factored into the calculations.  The other bonuses from each item will also have to be judged on a game-by-game basis and were left out for this reason - do you want the added health regen and movement speed offered by a FoN or do you want the extra mana and spell shield offered by a BV?

Some of these concepts might be confusing so I will be happy to clear them up and show specific examples in the comments.",[THEORY],False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,champSyn,default,True,t3_10b2b8,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/10b2b8/math_when_to_buy_banshees_veil_versus_force_of/,

These champions have a lot of CC that can shut down champions and allow the AD Carry (Graves being a HUGE component to a lot of these lanes due to his crazy burst damage) to simply chunk an opponent to no health before they can get away, or at least forces them out of lane quickly. With Sona, she can be a very aggressive support (once again, combo'ed with Graves), they can quickly chunk an enemy team into submission.

Hi, my summoner name is 'reatter', and I am Level 30 on EU-W and have 400+ normal games experience. This is my first reddit post ever, so don't be to harsh on me... ^^ I wanted to think about smart casting and key binding problems.

**What is smartcasting?**

Smartcasting provides much needed speed and reaction time when playing assassin/combo-heavy champions like Annie, Brand, Katarina, Talon, Veigar ... (generally all casters) Though it is possible to smartcast with [Shift][Q], I think smart casting should be FASTER and EASIER than normal casting. The difference to normal casting is: You don't see range indicators and you don't have to click to use the ability. Key press -&gt; Insta Use. After I played up to Level 30, I decided to give smart casting a chance. I smart cast every ability on every champ, just so that I don't have to remember which spell was smart casted when switching (tools for that can be found using Google), but other people like to see indicators for certain skill shots, like Anivia's Wall...

**Rebinding keys**

I rebound smart casting to the standard QWER keys, and in return bound 'dumb' casting to [Shift][QWER] for all spells. This allows me to use range indicators when I have the time to hit [Shift] and/or the enemy does not see me while I am hiding in the (most probably unwarded) brush.
I did the same for items, as smart casting Death Fire Grasp's or Gunblade's Active gains again 0.3 s in a fight. The only downside: Mis-clicking the target is easy in team fights. Arguably this holds true for normal casting too...

Any thoughts and/or other suggestions on how to improve smart casting / key binding for new players? 
Me thinks if you begin earlier to smart cast, you learn faster.

**Note on rebinding/displayed keys**

You can rebind the keys by changing the text-file 'Riot Games\League of Legends\Config\input.ini'. Tutorials/custom bindings are available on the internet ^^.
If you rebind [Shift][Q] for normal casting, my league of legends client shows an 'S' instead of a 'Q' in the spell box. While not really important, i found it quite irritating and ugly. A way to fix this, is to assign [Q][Shift] to normal cast's secondary key. It doesn't work, but gets the 'Q' displayed.

Any questions and/or suggestions?",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,default,True,t3_tgcvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tgcvn/optimal_keybinding_for_smart_casting/,

I think this is a little silly and I'm getting tired of people raging with no actual reasoning to back it up. Here are some of my thoughts:

Heal: It doesn't heal for that much, and I don’t use it unless I’m running support. But it's an AE heal which can make or break a teamfight in a pinch. Most of the time when someone yells about ""fuckin crutch heal!!! noob!!!"" it was because the person in question healed themselves and either survived or killed the attacker. In that case Heal won the fight. Crutch? Or tactic?

Clarity: ""clarity is bad. learn 2 manage mana, noob."" These people have never played a champ like Lux, have they? 300 mana to start. 70 mana per spell. You're out of mana in 4 spellcasts. Now I agree you should be conservative and focus on farming early game and all that, but Clarity will let you spam more and lane like crazy. Lots of people say ""don't waste a spot on clarity, take blue buff!"" I agree blue buff is awesome. But it’s not always viable to get (especially if your jungler is stupid  or needs it). And calling Clarity a “crutch” but saying you need blue buff? You’re just replacing a crutch with another crutch.

And along that same line of thought, I’ve been thinking about Flash. Flash is considered THE summoner spell to have, and basically if you don’t run it people are like “dude why u no flash.” I use it every once in a while, because having a teleport is nice. But seriously people it’s a 260 second cooldown. Yeah you can reduce it to 245 seconds, but that’s still 4 minutes. Ridiculous CD, short teleport, and if they have flash also (which they do, because everyone has flash) it was useless. Most common argument I see is “Flash helps you escape a gank if you’re out of position.” Well you could say “learn 2 stay in position, noob. Crutch flash is crutch.” I’m not saying that, but my point is the same line of argument could be used.

**TL;DR: Basically, I think it’s silly to call any spell, tactic, or ability a “crutch.” Just because it isn’t viable on every character doesn’t make it bad or make you bad for using it.**

I know a ton of people are going to disagree with me and that’s okay! Honestly I would like some civil discussion regarding this topic. I posted it in this subreddit and not /r/leagueoflegends because I was hoping the community here would be informative and intellectual, and that I would avoid the usual “l2p noob,” “get to high ELO and then you’ll see,” and “nope. It’s bad” replies. So discuss away! Upvotes for everyone who contributes to a meaningful discussion!

**EDIT:** As promised, upvotes for everyone! Thanks for the replies everyone; I'll check up on this later because right now I'm going to go play some LoL instead of talking about it haha.

I've also included a brief note of each champion's attachment to that city-state or their motive for joining the League of Legends, as well as each city-state's inclination towards either Demacia or Noxus.

I've also organized many champions as ""Neutral."" To further clarify exactly why these champions are Neutral in the Demacian-Noxian War, I've further divided the Neutral category into ""Chaotic Neutral,"" ""Lawful Neutral,"" and ""Neutral,"" since D&amp;D terms are always so useful (Neutral instead of True Neutral because the latter has philosophic implications that would not be accurate). Chaotic Neutral in this case usually means champions who don't really care about the war, but simply seek to commit crimes, murder people, or are otherwise morally ambiguous. Lawful Neutral refers to champions who have taken no side in the conflict, but have some strong sense of justice, fight for a selfless cause, or have some other strong belief system. Neutral refers to champions who have taken no side and either never apparently intend to, have no apparent strong belief systems apart from fighting, or have no other clear indicators on their chaotic/lawful alignment. All of the Neutral classifications are, of course, very subjective and unclear, so I've mostly just taken my best guess at that part of the list. I have not considered any Ionian or Freljordian champions as Neutral of any sort.

If you find anything you disagree with or I've gotten some part of this list wrong, feel free to point it out and I'll explain my reasoning and see if some other classification is better.

I want to talk a little about the mindset and how to play support, rather than the usual what to do as a support. Ward here, do this, I don't like that. It's formulaic and you can never remember it for all the supports. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I believe the core of the support playstyle is to do as much as you can with as little as you can. You have no tanky items, but you still want to soak damage for your team. You don't have AP but you still want to harass and poke with your spells. As a support you are, with your jungler, the most important person on your team. While the rest of your team provides the damage, the two of you enable the situation to produce that damage safely. Take the difference between support Zyra and mid Zyra. Both support and mid Zyra can initiate, but its risky. If support Zyra dies, it is of little consequence as she likely got off her initiation and your team can follow up, along with the added bonus of the enemy wasting burst on you. But if mid Zyra dies, the initiation is completed likely, but a huge chunk of damage is dead now. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On the purpose of warding, a lot of times it's spoken of in a purely defensive manner. Ward so I don't get ganked, etc. Wards are a *play making tool*. When I play mid as Diana, I ward both sides of the river (sometimes a little further out) so that I can play extremely aggressively without fear of the jungler coming when I'm diving. When you have a Lux or Ezreal on your team, warding their blue lets you steal it easily. *Supports carry games by enabling their teammates to make educated decisions on when to make plays.* If you have their whole jungle lit up, you can gangbang their ADC when he's catching up on farm with wraiths. But if the map is black, all MIA, you wouldn't dare go in there. If you have red warded and you see their jungler giving the ADC red, that's a free dragon/bot tower or baron/top tower, depending on what side you are on. Also, I want to advertise my favourite ward spot in the game: mid lane. When the towers go down, ward that spot on the crossroads. If you're likely to be playing on their side of the map for the next 3 minutes, ward their side. If you're losing and they're on your side, ward your own side. It's invaluable, especially when people group mid for no reason as they do quite often in silver and gold. If you have poke, that ward makes it super easy to land it. If you have hard engage, you know exactly when its a 4v5 because one of the enemies got bored and left. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Vision control is something you may hear about, but it's never really elaborated on. The purpose of vision control, in my eyes, is to establish an area of control on the map. When you pink the lane brush in bot lane, you are in control of that bush. When you have an oracles and sweep around Baron, you are in control of Baron. They're forced to either cede the Baron, or do some risky reconnaissance. When you have vision and vision control, you do almost anything you want. You can get more vision, you can gank anyone, or you can force favourable fights. Also, for some of you in bronze or silver: sometimes you buy oracles and you see *nothingggggg*. That's fine, don't get discouraged and stop buying oracles. Knowing they have no wards is the purpose of oracles, getting the gold for clearing them is just a bonus. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As for learning how to learn how to support, I want to combine those three points to the extreme. The easiest way to do this is to be ranged, but you can do it with anyone as the melees usually have their strengths even with no items. **The idea is, you buy philo, sightstone, mobility boots, and oracles, and spend the rest of your money for the rest of the game on wards**. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How does this help you learn to support? Easy:

* You have no items, so you have to be very careful about how you engage any fights. This forces you to make smart plays and have proper vision.

* You have no items, so you can buy almost limitless amounts of wards, to practice learning allll the ward spots and when and why to put them there. Take for example a pink ward on the small circular bush near dragon/baron, or a ward in the crook of the wall inside the pit. You have enough wards to practice all these spots.

* Mobi boots lets you ward everywhere, because as the game gets later and later, laners are more and more reluctant to sacrifice a slot to ward. Its very difficult to light up all the important locations at once, but mobi boots makes it easier. 

* Oracles lets you ward safely and expand your area of control. You don't want to ward their jungle without on, as you'll likely die if they see you. Mobi helps a lot with this.

Thanks for reading, if there's anything you guys can suggest, please say so. If you want it more thorough or specific I can do that as well. This is my first big post I believe.

The ability to ask yourself this question automatically can be trained: Play whole games with a champion you're familiar with consciously deciding to ask that question. Do that enough and you'll start getting good at it. This is especially true for mid/jungle as they are the two that end up roaming most in midgame/the transition to late game. The kinds of things you want to look for to make those decisions are mentioned a lot on this subreddit. If you're mid and there are four bot and one top, you can either push mid tower or leave to gank top/help bottom. Could you get multiple kills by going bot and fighting a 4v4? This depends on how powerful you are compared to the other mid laner/how fed the enemy champs are. Or would it be too tough to secure a kill down bot, but your team are safely planted under tower at full health? And could you secure a kill top if you know it isn't warded and their lane is pushed?
These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about when deciding where you will be most useful.

 * If you don't know how to play jungle, learn to play jungle. Even if you're not a very good jungler, it helps to have an understanding of the role, and what is useful for a jungler. You can learn this really quickly through trying out jungling. You learn how useful it is if bot lane clears wards for you, or top pushes their lane to let you gank through the lane bushes, or mid lets their lane get pushed. This will help you understand how to work with a jungler and what the jungler feasibly can/cannot do.
 * Objectives objectives objectives. Objectives win games. Begin to look for unprotected objectives or opportunities to easily pressure a tower. If you kill 4/5 of the enemy team and only lose two team members, you have enough champs alive to make a significant push together on one lane, or split push and apply more pressure to other lanes, or even take dragon if you're fed enough or it's late in the game. The global rewards for taking objectives far outweigh your individual farm or getting another kill. I don't remember where I heard this on here, but ""Kills snowball lanes, objectives snowball games."" 
 * Lastly, really take notice of your teammate's pings. They very likely have seen something you haven't, and it's a good habit to always check your minimap when you hear a ping, even if it's briefly. I can't tell you how many ganks I've been saved from by a teammate alerting me of an incoming lee sin or zac. This is especially true when you're really focused on farming or trading: You won't move your eyes at all from your action most of the time, so you'll miss things you would normally notice.

Sorry this got so long! I just wanted to share a few things that really helped me improve my game. This will help you carry a team more easily once you win your lane as well!

If you already have the correct mindset towards your jungler, then please disregard this post, I am aiming this more towards newer players who might not understand the mysterious jungler.

If you lose your lane, it is not the junglers fault, it is your fault. The jungler has priorities. If you keep dying in lane, and the enemy gets fed, chances are any good jungler is just going to leave you alone and try to snowball another lane to counter your lane opponent. It is not his responsibility to babysit your lane and waste his time and potentially give away a double kill.

It is NOT the junglers duty to match the amount of times the enemy jungler has ganked your lane. If the enemy has ganked your lane 3 times, and your jungler only once, you are not ""owed"" 2 ganks. The reason you keep getting ganked and killed is your own fault. Either you are not warding correctly, you are over extending, or you keep staying in lane with low health.

It is not the junglers responsibility to call ""MIA"" for the enemy jungler (seriously). I've had this a few times where I didnt tell a lane the jungler was coming (I am not joking) and it was ""my fault they died"". Yes, the jungler can help by pinging if he feels the jungler is coming to your lane, but it is impossible to keep tabs 24/7.

Do not think you are ""owed"" the buffs in the jungle. The common one is mid thinking they are entitled to blue buff. If the jungler knows what he is doing, he wont give the blue buff to a mid laner who is going to die and give it straight to the enemy. He will keep it for himself or give it to someone else. If this happens, do not rage and call the jungler a noob, accept you are having a bad game and attempt to change that.

Do not keep asking for ganks if you are behind in lane and have no kill potential. You will waste the junglers time, and potentially give away extra kills to the enemy you're against.

This is quite uncommon but it has happened to me, but do not tell the enemy team in all chat when your junglers buffs are respawning, or tell them where he is. I took a blue buff for myself in one game because mid was dying quite frequently, and very very toxic, so they took it upon themselves to inform the enemy in all chat where I was in the jungle. 

Do not rage at junglers when they take a few CS after a gank, they took time out of their farming to help you, and they need the few CS to keep up in levels and gold and it makes a big difference, when a laner isnt really going to miss a few CS here or there. On the flip side if the jungler is taking the piss, feel free to shout at them to get them to leave.

Do NOT rage at a jungler when he is freezing your lane until you get back to lane from base. He is not ""stealing your farm"" nor is he ""pushing your lane"". What he is doing is of benefit to the both of you, the jungler gets vital exp and gold, from minions that you werent going to be able to get anyways as they would have died by the time you get back to lane, and the lane doesnt get pushed to your tower and your tower takes damage/you lose even more creeps due to your tower.
Again this has a flipside, if the jungler is pushing for no particular reason and the enemy freezes the lane at their tower, you're gonna have a bad time. Let them know not to do it as you dont want the lane pushed.



To summarise, junglers are NOT the reason you lost lane, do not rage at the end of the game, or during it for that matter, because all the jungler is going to think is that you're a toxic moron who isnt worth his time and chances are you'll receive even less help from him. The jungler is there to help your ENTIRE team, not just you, he is there to help you snowball, and secure objectives (among other things) but he is not to blame if you lose your lane. You were in the lane with your opponent, not your jungler.

Remember, junglers have feelings too ;)

1371175277.0,23,self.summonerschool,1gb7xn,What I've learned as I've climbed from Silver 5 to Silver 2.,luckyboyblu,27,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gb7xn/what_ive_learned_as_ive_climbed_from_silver_5_to/,"And when I say Silver 5, I mean I was one of those people who just got lucky and got carried into it. I main top/mid, but here are some things I've learned.

1. Do not fight Riven from levels 1-3. She will beat you hard. The only person I've lost to as Riven in those levels is Jax, and that's because we killed each either at the same time.

2. As an ADC, try and autoattack them while they are going for a ranged creep. Do it while they are mid auto and back off. Do this whenever you can, they cannot respond because their auto is on cooldown.

3. If you are a support like Leona, be sure your adc is ready for the engage. It's extremely annoying for both when someone engages and the ADC can't back it up. Don't engage while they are csing, unless you ping and go.

4. If you notice everyone is coming for you, assume they are. Don't get greedy and say you'll get the farm and run. You will probably die and put your team at a serious disadvantage, because now it is 4v5.

5. End a game as fast as you can. Don't try and get kills for fun. I've lost games where we were up 40 kills just because we gave them the chance to catch up.

6. Stop arguing with people. Even if you are losing, a negative attitude all around is helping your enemies win. You start off the game with five enemies, don't make more.

7. If your support isn't warding, do it yourself. It's better to delay an item a bit in exchange for having vision that can save your lives.

8. If you lose a game, ask yourself why you couldn't carry. What specifically lost it for you? Why not roam and help the losing lane before it gets worse?

9. If you are getting camped, it isn't as bad as you think. You are forcing the jungler to apply pressure to just your lane. In the meantime, your other lanes can take objectives.

10. Don't just counterpick and assume you'll win. If the person is good with their champion, they'll probably beat you.

11. On the otherhand, don't be disheartened about being countered. Ask what makes them counter you so hard, and try to prevent it or outplay them. I'm a good Riven for my level, and I regularly beat people who pick Renekton, Jayce, Teemo, etc. into me because I know how to play against them.

12. Don't say gg in champion select. I had an Irelia freak out because we had no tank and we would definitely lose. We easily won that game, it was a complete stomp.

13. The game is not over until the Nexus explodes. I've had two games today in which we were down by a large margin, people arguing, but I calmed everyone down and we come back. In low elo, people will probably throw. If they overextend, pick them off.

14. Look at your advantages and expand on them. Is the enemy top laner scared to cs because of you? Only attack the creeps when they have a tiny amount of health to freeze the wave and deny them more. Zone them from it. If they are gone, push it right to the tower and deny them the xp and cs.

There's a lot more, like the usual ""ward everywhere"" and ""don't feed"", but I doubt they would be useful. I don't even know if these are useful, but it's helping my friend get out of Bronze (started Bronze 4, now in Bronze 1 promos to Silver!), so I figured they might help others.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1371175714.0,,default,True,t3_1gb7xn,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gb7xn/what_ive_learned_as_ive_climbed_from_silver_5_to/,

I myself am not the most mechanically sound player, but I try. I am however usually fairly good at outsmarting my opposition and peeling for my team.

I thought I'd share my success with you guys in an effort to demonstrate to anyone out there who thinks otherwise that a tanky jungler can carry games quite easily using only good decision making, a few well placed ults, and a couple gnarly anchor throws. This is true, at least in bronze, and maybe beyond.

I know many will find this feat unimpressive, but for me its a big boon. I was originally placed in Bronze II after losing 3-7 in placements. I then attempted to carry myself out with MF and quickly found that I wasn't mechanically skilled enough to play ADC with no escapes and very little peel (bronze players usually don't peel for ADC). 

Anyways, you can see my stats [HERE](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20071942). 5.0 KDA Nautilus with a 77.8% win rate over 26 games.

Take hope fellow bronze players and play what you know best. If you play Annie, be the scariest Annie in Bronze tier until you get out. It's not that bad. I played almost exclusively Naut and Amumu in normals in S2 and had kind of given up on them for FOTM junglers that I didn't really sync with. 

ELO hell doesn't exist. Summonerschool has helped me stop looking at the game as my team failing and helped me identify what I need to do to get better.

This thread details the negative individuals we have encountered in the Bronze league. Confused and not sure what's going on? Check out the following threads to catch up!

* [Spreadsheet of our progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArnAs1sbDO2VdEE3SFAwZk9RU3ZrUVNSNFRWNUhnb1E&amp;usp=sharing)

* [Intro thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ejdrt/journey_from_bronze_tips_and_tricks_from_a_gold/)

---------------

Anyway, the purpose of the thread today is to discuss what many players have dubbed ""Elo hell"". This is the land of feeders, trolls, instalockers, and what have you that will keep the player in question away from their true ranking. Blanket Ninja and I have been playing in Bronze Elo for the past few days, and we have experienced these individuals firsthand for most of our games. Let's have a look at the offenders we've found down here!

* **""WTF I called [x]!""** Probably the most common dude down here, this character will instacall a role [usually anything but support] and proceed to complain if someone in a higher pick takes said role from him. Sometimes they will choose another role, but sometimes they'll be persistent and pick whatever role they called in the first place, leading to some silly consequences in game like having to duo top.

    *Example:* 

   [WTF I called [x]!]: adc pls

    goodfeel: mid

   Lunatyco118: top

  A Purple Marmot: middle or top please

 FearWarrior: adc

  [WTF I called [x]!]: WTF DUDE

  [WTF I called [x]!]: SRSLY

  [WTF I called [x]!]: im picking twitch

  [WTF I called [x]!]: idc

    **How to deal with:** Instacalling in Bronze is the norm and both teams have to deal with it. You as a player do not have a disadvantage in regards to the other team because your team has a WTF I called [x] - chances are, the other team have an even higher chance of getting a WTF I called [x] because you aren't a WTF I called [x] ...right? In general, there is not too much you can do to change the situation beyond a little light encouragement. Just play as you normally would and don't let their attitude get to you.

-------------

* **""0/4 in 5 minutes feeder""** A lot of players complain that one of their teammates went into lane and played very poorly, thereby ruining the team's chances of winning. The 0/4 in 5 minutes feeder character lets the opposing lane snowball and dominate midgame, thereby leaving your team with no option but a painful loss. Or so you think.

  *Example:* [This horrible A Purple Marmot person goes 0/5 top lane and feeds Lee Sin!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MggcORAah50)

  **How to deal with:** Hey, you're not perfect either are you? I bet that you were that 0/4 in 5 minutes feeder guy once or twice. People get outplayed or ganked or camped all the time. Put yourself in their situation - can you help them? If you're mid or jungle, maybe you should roam bot to help them get a kill or possibly Dragon. Don't rage at them, don't tell them they're doing bad or anything, because chances are they already know. A little encouragement and help will go a long way.

---------------

* **""WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!""** This guy is almost as common as WTF I called [x]. You'll see him raging at anyone whose score is negative and saying ""gg"" if the enemy team gets first blood, all the while saying how awesome he is at the game and how he would be in Diamond if it wasn't for all you f33d3r n00bs keeping him down!

  *Example:* 

  [WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!]: fking junglr camping me

  [WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!]: no mia from noob bot gg

  [WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!]: noob bot is y im not diamond

  **How to deal with:** Mute them. Most of the time, there's no sense in talking back to them and if you're winning, his/her sickening ego will probably get to you. 

--------------

* **""Oh crap, my cat's on fire g2g""** A lot of people leave games in Bronze with a plausible excuse usually implying Internet issues [or maybe their cat's actually on fire, you never know]. These guys might reconnect, or they might not. You never know - it's like a surprise!

 *Example [this actually happened to me]:*

  [Oh crap, my cat's on fire g2g]: sorry guys my dumb sister locked herself out of the house

  [Some guy]: LEAVE HER OUTSIDE U FKING USELESS PIECE OF $#@^ MAOKAI

  **How to deal with:** Stuff happens! It's frustrating to deal with an AFK player, but try to be understanding, because the same thing can and will happen to you. Report them if you'd like, but know that emergencies happen all the time.

  But sometimes you'll get the guy who goes 0/2 in lane and flat out ragequits. It sucks, but there's not too much you can do in this situation besides play passive and safe and take any advantage you can. Many people have won 4v5s in the past, and you can too \o/ Stay calm, play passive, farm up what you can, and report the ragequitter in the post-game lobby.

-------------------

* **""gg they have [x]""** This guy will complain when you don't ban Amumu/Shen/Malphite/Blitz etc., and will further his complaints if the other team picks him up. If your team is ahead, they'll be happy to be crushing that ""OP"" champ, but when you're behind, all he'll say is ""gg didn't ban [x]"".

  *Example:* 

  [gg they have [x]]: PCIK SHEN
  
 [gg they have [x]]: WTF they got shen, gg surrender

  **How to deal with:** There are reasons why certain champs are considered OP in certain ranks. Malphite, for example, has an unstoppable initiate on a group of people that's a clear sign for his team to go in and wreak havoc, so people ban him because they can't counterplay him. Besides saying something like ""Shen isn't that OP"", all you can pretty much do is encourage your team to engage in counterplay - maybe gank Malphite more to shut down his farm, or tell your teammates not to stand on top of each other, or pick Janna to reset a fight.

----------------

That's about all I can recall off the top of my head. If you have anyone to add with details on how to deal with them, feel free to contribute! I hope this thread helped some of you determine how to react to these tropes found in Bronze solo queue :]

Cheers and have a lovely day!

&gt;*These are mostly quality of life changes for Warwick, who actually spent more time channeling Infinite Duress than he spent suppressing his target.
