Good Evening ladies and gentlemen, 

Welcome to VicPD's first Ask Me (almost) Anything. Your captain for this evening will be Cst. Mike Russell. We encourage you to place your seat backs and tray tables in their full and upright positions. We're expecting a smooth flight, but you never know when turbulence could strike. 

I'm hoping to answer as many questions as possible tonight, but will be checking back on this thread long after my 7 pm bedtime.  We have four wonderful volunteer moderators from the /r/VictoriaBC subreddit here to help us out. 

My hope for tonight is some really great dialogue. I'm not into slinging mud and hope you're here to become informed or present some good questions. Let's open up some great community dialogue. 

I'll be back at 6 to start answering your questions. ",,False,self,t5_2rbsy,1353647868.0,,vicpd,True,t3_13lk3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/13lk3z/vicpds_amaa_thread/,

One of the kids sits down across from me. I was listening to music so I didn't catch the start of what turned out to be a 'lovely' conversation. I clued in right after 3 uniformed students walked up to the kid sitting down, called him a ""fucking faggot"" and smacked him across the face.


Before I even had the chance to get my headphones off and tell them off, the guy sitting next to me stood up and confronted the group suggesting that they 'go forth and fornicate' (to paraphrase it mildly). Group of 3 gets in his face. Four other people, all male students sitting around me, immediately stand up and circle them. I've never seen the faces of a group of people turn to a look of sheer terror so quickly.

Guy 1 yells at the driver to stop and open the back doors, which he does just as the bus was turning onto Cedar Hill X, and suggests that the 3 get off the bus immediately. They did. Guy 1 then gave the kid his cell number and told him to call him if it ever happens again.

VicPD Search for Suspects after 11-Year-Old Girls Robbed

Victoria BC – VicPD Detectives are searching for two suspects after a pair of 11-year-old girls were robbed last night just after 5 p.m.

The girls were approached by a man and a woman while walking home from Hillside Mall.  The suspects demanded the girl’s cell phones and backpacks while being threatened. The girls gave their property to the suspects and then ran home. 

Officers combed the area last night and the case is now being investigated by detectives. 

VicPD is looking for any information on the suspects who are described as both being Caucasian, the male having all black clothes with a hood covering his head at the time of the robbery, and being in his mid-twenties. The female is approximately 5-foot-6, also wearing all black.  She is also described as having shoulder length dark hair.

Some back story: A couple of weeks ago I was awakened to the sounds of a fire alarm and people yelling frantically. I looked outside of my bedroom window to see that a tree (about 15 feet away from my balcony) had been set on fire. It was a pretty damn big fire. All of the emergency services arrived at the scene and got everything under control, so a little shaken I went back to bed.

Fast forward to this morning: An elderly First Nations man and a few other people were conducting some sort of ceremony (I assume having something to do with honouring the tree) with a small, handheld drum and a little bit of singing. Nothing major, nothing disruptive, just very unassuming and almost ambient. 

He had been at it for about 20 minutes when a guy who looked to be in his forties approached him, proceeded to scream about it being noisy (which it wasn't) and then proceeded to assault this elderly man by very violently pushing him to the ground, kicking him and ripping the drum and stick from his hands and breaking them. Keep in mind, it wasn't some strung out junkie that did this, it was some white collar looking fella with a nice outfit, glasses, etc. It was just really fucked up to me. This elderly native man was literally assaulted for practicing his cultural traditions, during the middle of the day. He was on his small apartment complex's property (with most of his fellow tenants actively participating) when this guy came from outta nowhere. I guess the guy who did it was from my complex. I just want to emphasize just how quiet this ceremony was. They only reason I knew it was happening was because I went out on my balcony to water my plants. So fucked.

I'm sorry if this rant sounds stupid to some of you or whatever, I just needed to get this off of my chest. I still just cannot believe what I saw. I'm sure some people will argue the same shit I've heard before ""Oh, he was on private property, he should have had a permit, they shouldn't push their culture in public blah blah blah..."" But fuck that. For real. He was an old man practicing his fucking cultural beliefs. He wasn't fucking infringing on shit. What the fuck is wrong with a person that fucking resorts to straight-up assault over something so incredibly minuscule?

 I've lived here for 2 years and have never seen anything remotely like it. Anyway, I just wanted to let my fellow Victorians know that this crazy shit happened.

Without wanting to write something way too long and then having to TL;DR it, and then TL:DR the TL;DR to make it simple, I'll just do a TL;DR^TL;DR.

TL;DR^TL;DR - I lost my job of 6  years last year while waiting for approval through said job for Short Term Disability for long term chronic pain issues.  My wife works, kept working, and we reduced our  frugal spending even more immediately.  We used my severance, Medical EI, and our bank let us skip a couple of payments while we got out condo ready for market (basic sprucing up).  Our roommate just gave us his notice today a month earlier than expected, and we've had our place up on the market for a month.

If you're looking for a condo in Saanich right near Uptown or a townhouse in Sooke, my wife, my inlaws, and myself would be indebted to you.  Even if you just know someone that's looking, or anything, we'd appreciate the help.  I'm a bit hesitant to post the links for the properties, but will send them to redditors who are interested in seeing or sharing.  I probably should be posting this from a throwaway since I'm a pretty open person online and in person, but somehow mixing the two has never done me right.

I suppose now I'm supposed to hold up a sign about the 99% and foreclosure or something and take a picture.

Thanks for anything that you can do.  Even upvoting so people can see this is very appreciated.

Edit:  Thank you so so much everyone.  I'm very thankful that this is getting visibility, and I really appreciate each and every comment, PM, and upvote.  I really do.

Edit 2:  Wow.  Thank you again to everyone!  I've had so many messages today, I'm having trouble keeping up.  I really appreciate all of the questions, comments, and even the grilling or tough love on this one.  I've always been someone who appreciates straight talk, so it's not lost on me. : )

I've also decided to just man up and post the links.

My [condo](http://www.realtor.ca/propertyDetails.aspx?propertyId=11429358&amp;PidKey=970327324) in Saanich and my inlaw's [townhouse](http://www.usedvictoria.com/classified-ad/Imagine-_16611015) in Sooke.

I'm just trying to go to the bank or whatever, I don't need some 20-something bad-argument-hippie working on commission to guilt trip me.

You might say, ignore them. This works in a big city where you don't see the same people twice. But in Victoria this gets awkward quick.

I will never donate to someone on the street, there's no way in hell I'm giving my payment info to some random dude. I WILL go to their organizations website and donate there, if I want to - I have donated to the Red Cross through their site.

This is just me venting. If you are a street fundraiser and are reading this:

Sure enough this morning he was hobbling around with a cut on his back paw (luckily no glass stuck in there that I can see). Anyways since the weather got really nice a couple weeks ago, I've noticed a disturbing amount of people sitting down there with beer bottles. After spending a decade practically living on the beaches in Vancouver, mainly Wreck and Spanish Banks, this is crazy to me. I thought it was basic common etiquette to bring cans to the beach or the pool or anywhere people walk around barefoot, let alone a beach specifically for dogs. To be clear, I'm not against beer at the beach; I'd rather our liquor laws focused on the people who act like idiots instead of those who just want to responsibly enjoy a cold one in the sun.  Now I have to be the annoying guy walking up to people politely suggesting they switch it up next time ... if you agree and spend much time on the beach, I encourage anyone to help me with this. /end rant",,False,self,t5_2rbsy,False,,,True,t3_1i1fhu,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1i1fhu/rant_time_beer_bottles_the_beach/,

Victoria BC – VicPD officers are investigating as suspicious incident after a 14-year-old girl was accosted in the 800-block of Rockheights Avenue in Esquimalt late yesterday.

The girl was walking home from a friend’s house at approximately 5:20 p.m. last night when a man, who was walking a short distance behind, started yelling at her to get her attention. The girl ignored his attempts, but the man approached from behind and put his arms around her.  

The girl was able to squirm free and noted the man was holding a beer in his hands and appeared intoxicated. He continued to yell obscenities at her as she ran away.

At this time there has been no other similar incidents reported and nothing to suggest that the general public are at risk. The actions of this male are of concern and as such this incident will be investigated thoroughly. 

The man is described as a Caucasian man in his late 20’s to early 30’s. He is approximately 5-foot-10 to 6-feet tall and weighs between 160 pounds and 180 pounds.  He was fair skinned and had stubble on his face. He was wearing a black baggie sweater and had brown, neck length hair. 

Anybody with information is asked to call VicPD at 250-995-7654 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

1Tbsp Garlic, minced

1/2 cup onion- use jumbo or large onions- preferrably Walla Walla as they have a sweeter flavour

1/3 cup white sesame seeds- bake the sesame seeds until golden brown or buy the sesame seeds pre-toasted

Prepare the mustard according to the instructions on the box. The mixture should be very creamy. I use approx. 2 tsp. of water with the 2 tsp of mustard powder. Let stand for at least 10 minutes.

I used one and wasn't impressed with the service. I called before the other one expired, and I was assured I could use it for the deal on the Groupon. I called later and was told I couldn't, by the same person. Then I went in a few months later just to use up the value of the Groupon ($25) on a purchase, and I was told that he wouldn't accept it. That refusal is against BC law, since Groupons are considered to be gift certificates and the value paid for the Groupon never expires (which it says right on the deal page). I walked out immediately (I don't know if they had started my order yet, but I didn't care), and I vowed not only to never go back there but to make sure that others knew what could happen if they were to buy a Groupon there. Groupon refunded my money immediately in the form of Groupon bucks, so I'm still happy with the service they provide.

In [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1emuth/rank_your_top_five_victoria_breweries_brewpubs/), Victorian Redditors ranked their top five breweries and brewpubs in the CRD. The scores have now been assigned, with each ""first"" getting five points down to each ""fifth"" getting one point. 

    1. Hoyne        62
    2. Phillips     56
    3. Driftwood    48
    4. Lighthouse   30
    5. Moon         29
    6. Spinnakers   13
    6. Swans        13
    8. Van Island   12
    9. Saltspring   10
    10.Canoe         1

I expected it to be a toss-up between Driftwood and Phillips, so hats off to Hoyne, the newest brewery. I knew they had a following but wowee. The ""other"" winner is Moon Under Water, which despite being the newest brewpub got more points than the other three combined.

Let's do this again next year.

Hey all,

The results for our survey are finally in (sort of). My intention was to have all the results compiled/posted by this weekend but my schedule has not permitted me to do so.  
As a result I am simply providing the results in a mostly raw format. All I have done is remove errors and (some) of the junk from the results. It should still give you the information you were looking for though. It's just not as pretty as initially intended.  
  
Once again I apologize for not having this in a ""prettier"" format, but it was either this or wait another week until I have free time.  
  
I will be drawing the names for the free Reddit gold later this evening.  
Thanks. :)

I figured a few of you r/victoriabc folk are into hockey. I work for the Save On Foods Memorial Centre and as I am sure you are aware, We've just started the first season with the Victoria Royals.

I have talked to a few people and have set-up an online promotion for you guys. Anyone interested in taking in a game for a discounted rate, it works out to be $10 per ticket in the corners and ends. 

The game this rate is applicable for is Saturday November 12th, 2011 against the Red Deer Rebels. Puck drops at 7 pm! I've set the promo up to go from today until November 12th at 5 pm. 

Your subject to availability meaning that if we sell out (which might happen) we aren't able to offer any more tickets.

If you are interested, go to this link - http://ev10.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/EVExecMacro?linkID=rgp&amp;evm=prmo&amp;RSRC=&amp;RDAT=&amp;caller=PR

The Promo code is REDDIT. Enter it in and grab some tickets!!!!!

EDIT- I should mention that there is a $2 transaction charge, so buying 2 tickets will total $22, 4 tickets $42 etc. That $2 was unavoidable, sorry guys!

About six grand worth of stuff was missing, including my backpack. The crooks thought it was their lucky day, but little did they know that THE TRIUMVIRATE OF JUSTICE was about to rain on their pitiful parade. Unbeknownst to them, there was more than standard issue tracking software installed on the i-pad they had surreptitiously swiped, and though they thought their tracks were covered, they stood out loud and clear. After the constabulary had assessed the damage, two friends and myself headed out to stake out the apartment building pegged as the probably lair of these Victorian ne'er-do-wells. We checked all the dumpsters in the area, and looked in all the vehicles, but turned up nothing, and the i-pad was no longer giving us a location. Nevertheless, we resolved to return in the early morning hours, should these criminals attempt to leave the premises with our property. At five a.m. our local eye in the sky tech wizard a.k.a. Oracle, informed us of movement, so six a.m. found us at yet another location, where through some diligent police work, one friend thought she saw a familiar vehicle from the night before, and a closer observation revealed her backpack in the back seat. At that point we called in the locals to take out the trash, which they did - arresting a handful of individuals, seizing a pair of villainous vehicles (we laughed as they were towed), and gaining access to an apartment frequented by a malicious band of (reputed) meth-dealing miscreants (in Esquimalt). Sweet sweet justice. The story continues to unfold, and a lot of property has yet to be recovered, but rest assured that when trouble strikes, WE may just possibly be there. ready. waiting.  All in all a better ending than we were expecting.

Edit: [here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/HSkb5.jpg) of the backpack that was taken - it has more beading on now, but easily recognizable!

This is an update to the Mountain Bike / Wire incident.

A quantity of wire was located at the location where the incident took place.

It would appear from the wire that it has been at that location for many years,
probably as many as 30 to 40. The wire itself is a thick gauged wire that likely
dates back to a time when there was active forestry in the area, or may even be a
telegraph wire from an even further distant past.

The wire does not appear to have been recently placed into the tree where it was
secured. There was no evidence of anyone accessing or climbing the tree. The wire
itself appeared to have actually grown into the tree.

This incident did not take place near a maintained or dedicated trail. Information
from another trail user was that the trail is not well used. The trail user
described seeing other people on the trail as unusual, stating further that she
rarely sees anyone in the area.

The wire itself was hanging in a manner that it may have been pulled across the
pathway as a joke; to deter others from continuing on the pathway; or possibly
accidentally by someone that had used the trail previously if it had become snagged
on a bicycle or clothing.

While the circumstances of this incident are concerning, there is little evidence to
suggest that this was done with any malicious intent on someone's part. Thankfully,
the injuries sustained by the mountain bike rider were minor.

The location of the incident was in a wooded area south east of Durrance Lake. CRD
Parks assisted with the investigation into this matter.",,False,self,t5_2rbsy,False,,,True,t3_1ftrw3,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1ftrw3/update_wire_strung_across_trail_at_durance_not/,

Hey folks,  
As promised I have a finally put together the survey. Took longer than planned as I had little free time this week.  
  
I have done my best to include all the (serious) suggestions made by you guys. If I missed something from that thread please let me know as it was likely accidental.  
  
I have opted to use Google Forms to collect the data as it makes things easier on me in the end.  You **DO NOT** need to be logged in to answer the questions.  

Answer as many or as few of the categories as you'd like. Please try to provide only one answer per category.  
  
In a week I will be selecting ~~3~~ 5 random users to receive a month or Reddit Gold. Just because I'm nice like that.  If you'd like to enter just leave your Reddit username as the answer to the final question.  I will be not comparing results with usernames.  
  
I will leave this survey up until next Monday at the earliest.
  
Thanks!

**EDIT1**: Those of you answering *nothing* but the part to enter your username to win gold, don't bother. Really, guys?  
**EDIT2**: Some of your responses are hilarious. I love it!  
Also, if this survey is any indication there's literally only 3 book stores in the city and every single ISP and cellular provider is ""shit"".

We'd made a reso. and the people before us were having too good of a time to leave so they had trouble seating us at first. 
We didn't wait long though and while we waited they made sure we all had drinks and were happy. 



*PROS:* 

- The food was DELICIOUS!!! I had the bacon cheese burger and it was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile (Also I highly recommend the onion nest) and everything is very reasonably priced.  
- wings: 75 cents a wing is not too bad when they taste that good. Chipotle Maple... best. 
- We didn't wait long in line (despite it looking like the line was long at first).
- The drinks were cheap ($5 for a strong bow!)
- the service was exceptionally friendly and relaxed for such a packed house. 
- Don't tell anyone, but all 8 of us got our first drinks on the house because we waited in line (not more than 10 minutes!).  
- He has an accent... so.. ladies??



*CONS:* 

- I think they were hoping there would be more a turnover... but a lot of the customers were drinking pitchers and eating wings and definitely not going anywhere!  (Maybe if it stays that way they'd consider just not taking reservations??)


overall, our entire group loved it and we will most definitely be going back! I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't!

Just trying to see if there's an interest in this. I think it's a useful service, as this is something I'd use regularly.

Here's the number: 250-999-0464, call it and type in the stop number (it's on the top of each stop sign, I believe). That is, not the bus route number but the stop number.

For now it's a very simple service. If you'd like any additional features, let me know in the comments.
I will add an SMS interface eventually as well. Right now you'd have to message a U.S. based phone number, which would be cost prohibitive.

To comply with the TOS: ""Route and arrival data used in this product or service is provided by permission of BC Transit. BC Transit assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or currency of the Data used in this product or service.""

**Edit:**

new features (nov 28th):

 * Ability to hear trips for a selected bus route.
 * Ability to leave voice feedback for the service.

new features (nov 29th):

 * SMS! Send a text message to 250-999-0464 with a bus stop number to get upcoming trips.

new feature (nov 30th):

 * SMS now accepts messages in ""#stop #route"" format, and will respond with upcoming trips for a specified route number. For example, you can message ""100048 24"" and get back upcoming trips for #24 at the Yates&amp;Broad bus stop.

Victoria BC – VicPD Detectives arrested a 48-year-old Toronto-area man after a robbery at the Royal Bank in the 1000-block of Douglas Street.

Officers were called just after 8 a.m. to the bank after a man entered and demanded cash from the teller. He had walked directly up to the teller shortly after opening, received some monies and left with the undisclosed amount of cash.

Working closely with the bank and agencies through Canada, the suspect was quickly identified as a parolee, on the run from outstanding warrants in Ontario.  The suspect was arrested at 1 p.m. in the 800-block of Colville road. During a subsequent interview he confessed to three separate robberies in Ontario and B.C.

“This is a great example of police agencies across Canada cooperating to put this robber back behind bars,” said Det. Lori Beauvais, one of the lead investigators, “The cooperation we had from the bank and these agencies surely led us to this quick arrest.”

The suspect was held in custody and is to make his first court appearance today.

Victoria BC – The Vancouver Island Integrated Major Crime Unit and VicPD Detectives are investigating after a homicide in Esquimalt last night. 

Just prior to 9 p.m., VicPD received a 911 call from a building in the 600-block of Grenville Avenue reporting some type of altercation at the residence.  Officers arrived to find a chaotic scene and one man unresponsive and suffering from severe injuries. Officers performed CPR until paramedics arrived and took the man to hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries. 

A second man was also injured in the fracas and is expected to make a full recovery. 

The area around the 600-block of Grenville was closed for hours as officers investigated, eventually leading patrol officers to locate and arrest the man believed responsible.  The 49-year-old Victoria man was arrested near the scene and is being held in custody for a tele-bail hearing later today. 

The victim is a 57-year-old Esquimalt man, and his family as asked that he not be identified. 

VicPD Detectives, Patrol, K9 and Forensic Identification services have all been at the scene throughout the night. Officers continue to comb the scene for evidence and are continuing the investigation.  The area around the 600-block will be closed for some time.

Russ George, in conjunction with a First Nations village on Haida Gwaii (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), has dumped around 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean in a technique known as ocean fertilization. The experiment, which is in violation of two United Nations moratoria, has outraged environmental, legal, and civic groups. 

Some new details are emerging about the project — including insights which suggest that the Canadian government knew what was going on but did nothing to stop it.

""For the past three days, myself and a handful of my friends who are also Shaw customers have been experiencing very slow download speeds. When I run the Shaw speed test, I get speeds from 90-95Mbps (I have Broadband 100) so that seems normal. When I try to stream any video or load any pages/images, it takes forever.
 
I have spoken to tech support, they could not figure it out, but have scheduled a technician to come and have a look, but I'm positive it's not on my side. [I've tried all of the options from here](https://community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1012), and nothing has worked. I've also run trace routes and 20/30 results are ""Request timed out.""
 
Everything was working normally until three days ago, and I didn't change any network settings, or do anything with my router to cause this issue. The fact that other people I know in the area are also experiencing this problem leads me to believe the problem is on Shaw's end.
 
Edit: I've spoken to six people that are Shaw customers in Victoria, and they are all experiencing a slow-down with their service.""

EDIT: Posted the link for this Reddit thread on the Shaw Community Support thread, and tweeted @Shawhelp about this problem. Hopefully we can get some help. Tweet them as well to try and get some attention.

EDIT 2: @Shawhelp tweeted back. ""@rileyjanzen As for the post, this is something we are looking into and please continue to follow it for updates. ^DR""

Update: It seems as if the speeds are a bit better today, but I'll stick with this until I find out what's going on.

/r/victoriabc, please forgive me for my rant:

I have never seen such a piss poor attempt at organizing an event in my life.

We were there for over an hour and a half before anybody mentioned what we were even THINKING OF DOING on Saturday. Nothing was properly communicated to the people that were there for the 1st time.

Other than the core group of organizers, nobody of the 150 people who came to the first meeting seemed to show up again to this one. There was about 50 of us this time.

Despite being lead by a self-appointed committee, they function on what they refer to as **'consensus based decision making'**, which is where if ONE SINGLE PERSON disagrees then they can derail the entire conversation and continue to debate, debate, debate until EVERYBODY AGREES.

**The dictatorship of the lowest common denominator.**

Here's how it went down:

1. 25 minutes of randomly talking among ourselves

2. 30 minutes of mostly ultra-leftist circle jerk speeches, including a 'moment of silence to reflect upon our feelings and aspirations' (wtf?)

3. 20 minutes arguing about whether or not we should be able to take pictures ('because some people aren't comfortable or have criminal records'...wtf?)

4. People started getting frustrated because nobody knew what was going on, people with kids and jobs were getting impatient at the endless debate of what we *think* we might want to do on Saturday and making sure that everybody had consensus on every last detail
5. After another 15 minutes of arguing about photographs, the organizers started explaining the complicated system of 'groups and committees' that they have set up and someone tried to start a debate on whether or not we would endorse a letter in solidarity with Native Peoples (what does that even have anything to do with...never mind)

6. We all split up into the groups of our choice, drafted up impossibly long 'agendas' of conversation and debate that we never even followed. The only conclusion was that we would 'continue the discussion on the website'

It was essentially a giant left wing circle jerk consisting of anarchists, students, conspiracy theorists, and a few others. 

Most of the 'organizers' didn't seem to have any qualms with an infinitely long discussion that lead absolutely nowhere while employed people with kids and real responsibilities couldn't quite wrap their heads around wtf was going on, why everything was taking so impossibly long to discuss or what we were going to DO.

Don't get me wrong, I'm as radical a leftist as they come, but this was just sad.

**TL;DR: Anarchists couldn't organize themselves out of a box if their lives depended on it.**

edit: Though I've been critical, I do want to say that I still do respect them for trying and I **do** think that people should still get involved somehow - I do believe it is an important movement, its just the way they organize that bothers me.",,False,self,t5_2rbsy,True,,,True,t3_l9qwi,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/l9qwi/so_i_went_to_the_second_occupy_victoria_meeting/,

There is petition going on here to see if the government can find a way to keep this historical and scientific 
landmark of Victoria open (did I mention it has been doing public tours since 1918?!). If nothing else try and make it out there sometime this summer before it closes.

Yes, this is a form of armchair protesting. More contact information can be found at:

Last night it just stood there and stared at me. It didnt seem to be intimidated by me. I walked closer to it a bit and sort of grunted and growled and stomped my feet at it but it didnt budge. I ended up taking a larger rock I had next to my door and throwing it at it and it silently bolted off into the darkness.

Thanks for sharing*

Posted by VicPDCanada on behalf of Saanich Police:

Saanich Police are presently investigating an abduction attempt in the Gordon Head area. Initial responding officers were sent as a result of multiple 911 calls made from the area at about 6:30 pm. 

Officers confirmed the involvement of a vehicle, the whereabouts of which is presently unknown.  The vehicle is a marked UHAUL van, white 2012 Ford Econoline, with BC license plate EG 7652 attached. The van is described as being marked with typical UHAUL advertising on the side similar to $18.95 a day or something close to that.

If anybody sees this vehicle they are encouraged to not approach it but call 911 immediately. Saanich Police Major Crimes Unit detectives have been called in to conduct the investigation. 

It is not expected that any further information will be released this evening. Calls to to the media cell and the Watch NCO will not be entertained about this incident.

UVic ECS 3rd Floor.
January 27 @5PM
48 hours
[Poster](http://globalgamejam.org/sites/default/files/locationImages/ggj_poster_2012.png?1325668101)
An [IGDA](http://www.igda.org/) event, sponsored by [Kano Apps](http://www.kanoapps.com/)




**What is a Game Jam?**

[From the pouty lips of Mr. Andy Moore](http://www.orcajam.com/): 

A bunch of like-minded people get together and work on what they love - games - for 48 hours.

Not everyone stays up the full 48 hours straight (we like to promote healthy sleeping!), but getting together and meeting new friends - sharing information - learning new skills - and having a blast creating something from nothing... all in a mere 48 hours!! ... is really an exciting time for everyone. What's more fun than getting together and doing what you love, with people that love you?

So come on out and meet people from the industry.. Hang out and work on your own projects, start a new one, or take the challenge: Make a game, start to finish, in 48 hours!

Programmers! Artists! Audio Engineers! Board game designers! Anyone interested in game development at all should come; team up with your newfound friends and make something amazing!

**Where is it?! When is it?! Oh god, please tell me!**

The 3rd floor of the UVic Engineering and Computer Science Building. I said it up there. Hello? Remember? The keynote begins at 5PM. I said that the event was a 48 hour event, but thats not exactly true. Doors are only open so late in the ECS building, and we can only stay if there is supervision by faculty. The alternative is hiring security during the night, which is costly. It will run late into the night, and start early in the morning.

**Price of Entry**

Free! But there will be a box for donations if you are feeling charitable. Any donations received will be used to help offset the cost of organizing the event. If there is a profit on the event, the surplus will go into the UVic GameDev club fund.

**But I'm not a Programmer...**

Bring Settlers of Catan. I want to play that game. Like... you bring a bro, and I'll bring a bro, and we'll just bro out the four of us. A real [bro-sesh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JUeDQbR-ts). 

Bring a board game. Bring a game you love. Game Jams are more exciting when there are more people so just come and hang out for a while.

However, please be respectful of those developers who are ""In the Zone"" and do not wish to be distracted. Developers will be thrilled to chat with you about their games, but probably not for too long.

**Okay so wait, what is happening exactly. You keep saying weird things. Is this real life?**

This *is* real life! Here is the list of events!

*Uvic GameDev presents Minecraft!* 
You know the dril. Play with a friend, or play alone. Whatever. It don't make no matter to me. Listen to me shoehorn excuses into my argument on how the skills in Minecraft are directly transferable to Game Development. 

*Board Game Jam*
 - Use existing board game pieces, sit down, and make a new game. Try it out on someone. Improve it. Do it again. Wear a hat.

*5 Minute Game Jam* 
- Making a Game (or piece of music) in 5 minutes; The results can be absolutely incredible. It is a spectator sport upon itself. My weapon of choice, Game Maker.

*Show and Tell*
 - Showcase some of the best games that have come out of Victoria in the last few years!

**I'm interested in doing some game development, but I have no experience...**

I suggest using these free Game Making utilities:

[Game Maker Lite](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/windows)
- Perfect for someone who has not programmed at all. Simple and powerful drag and drop interface, built onto a versatile scripting language. Pro version is affordable, and comes with additional features.

[Adventure Game Studios](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/)
- Versatle and intuitive for Point and Click Adventure Game Development. Free to use, free to develop and publish games with. Best for those with some programming, art, or game development experience prior.

**What's the 'sitch on internet? Food?**

I am working towards getting stable internet access available for all attendees. Unfortunately, this is not pinned down yet. My priority is for those who are developing, as they will need to be as efficient as possible. Luckily, if you are A UVic student, you'll have no problem using the school computers.

[Kano Apps](http://www.kanoapps.com/careers/), a Victoria based studio is sponsoring the event by supplying some food and drinks. However, depending on the number of people who arrive, supplies may be limited. You might want to bring some food, especially if you plan on developing a game.

**Okay! I want in!**

Go to the Global Game Jam website and register so you can post your game and your game's screenshots online. Remember, this is a global event, so people are doing this all around the world. If you use social media like Twitter or Tumblr, use the #GGJ and #screenshotsaturday tags to meet new awesome people just like you. After the event, post your games on the [LEVEL UP](http://www.meetup.com/levelup/) forums!


See you there. :)

Weekly alternatives are supposed to be the dirty tabloids of the urbanites. The Voice and NOW are fun filthy reads, pumping through their respective cities' hardened veins. High school newspapers often attempt to emulate them with cringeworthy results. Monday seems to resemble the latter. If I pick it up I wince at nearly every article. It doesn't even have a very good Calendar of Events.

What gives? Has it always been this bad? Is it just our small size?

The 19-year-old and her 22-year-old friend were just leaving Mayfair mall when they were approached by the suspect who asked for the time. When the one of the victims took out her cell phone to check, the suspect pulled a large knife on her. 

The suspect then demanded all her cash and the phone. The victims started to give their property, but the robbery was interrupted by a bus pulling up to the stop.  The suspect still made away with makeup, rings and some cash.

Detectives are concerned as this robbery closely mimics one last week where two 11-year-old girls were robbed of their cell phones near Hillside mall and investigators believe that the two may be related.

This similarity in these cases has Detectives issuing a warning to the public about personal electronic devices. They are hoping that the public can be extra vigilant in the use of cell phones, mp3 players and the like. Using these in an open area can attract undue attention. Please be aware of your surroundings and where you choose to use your electronics. 

The suspect in this robbery is described as a woman, about 22-years-old and having dyed blonde hair with a blue streak underneath.  She had a silver stud in her nose and blue or green eyes. She is believed to be 5-foot-2 to 5-foot-3 and having a very slim build.

Detectives are looking for any tips or information that may help them solve this crime. Please contact VicPD at the non-emergency line of 250-995-7654 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

Several employees have heard him state that he refuses to hire anyone of colour. He also refuses to hire any boys. The store is pretty much stocked only with girls that he finds to be good looking, and the people who our manager, a woman, hired. (I was hired by this manager). Recently, a black girl came in with excellent qualifications, she was given the job by our manager on the spot, and told to come in the next day to start work. However, when our manager told the owner that she hired her (he watched the exchange), he said she couldn't work here and she'd have to call her and tell her she couldn't be hired. So my manager called her and lied, saying that they weren't hiring anyone until they fixed the pipes, or something. It's pretty clear to me (and everyone else that I work with) that the only reason the owner didn't want her hired is because she's black. So my question is: is there anything that I can do to make sure this bastard gets what's coming to him? I haven't been discriminated against personally... I'm just really distressed by this.

I also believe that he gives preferential treatment to girls that he considers to be good looking. He's also made comments to certain girls about their looks. I don't know if that makes any difference.

I'm pretty disgusted by all this. Obviously I'm quitting soon. At the very least I'll write a strongly worded letter of resignation.",,False,self,t5_2rbsy,False,,,True,t3_y1hde,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/y1hde/what_can_i_do_when_my_boss_is_a_racist_asshole/,

My parents due to there own mental illnesses did not allow me to socially develop; what few friendships that were cultivated in school were eventually cutoff.

I never finished high school, and have suffered from depression since my teens. I spent my 20's in an inebriated state trying to forget my childhood, in the beginning it was mostly fun and I thought it helped me be more social but by my mid 20's I started doing cocaine and for 5 years I dug myself into a deep dark hole. With a help from a sibling I got myself clean and went to College, obtained a Health Care Assistant Certificate and have worked in an eldercare facility for a few years.

I'm back in school now doing my academic upgrading, wanting to take the nursing program; but my feelings of loneliness and despair have never disappeared. At the age of 32 I  have never had a g/f, do not know how to talk with men or women in social gatherings and don't know where to get help or what direction I should go.

I have lived here for 8 years and have noticed that car accidents involving seniors (especially hitting pedestrians and cyclists) Is a FAR too common occurrence. 

The scariest part: I work at a medical clinic where senior citizens ROUTINELY must come in and take an eye test as well as a cognitive awareness and general health check in order for them to be able to drive.  Many times I have checked their vision myself and noted that there is NO WAY IN HELL they should be driving!!!  But in my 8 years at medical clinics I have only ever seen 2 instances (out of 100s of exams) where licenses have been immediately revoked.  If the physician won't revoke their licences, who will?? No one, and there will continue to be accidents just like these.


**EDIT*** For anyone who's interested, I just spoke to a physician at work and he informed me that is is legislative LAW that if a doctor feels a person isn't fit to drive the are REQUIRED to write a letter to motor vehicles informing them.

He added that unfortunately, it is not something that's checked on and many walk-in clinic physicians aren't made aware that it's required by law.   :)

Our idea was actually inspired by the regular ""What Are You Wearing Today"" threads on r/malefashionadvice, although during our validation we ended up pivoting away from this idea. Instead we have made an app for sending a photo to a trusted group of friends while shopping to get quick, anonymous feedback showing their opinion on your clothing choice. 

We made this video to explain about startup weekend: http://youtu.be/cYqgBpPOurU. If you want to find out more, we are dressbetterco on facebook, twitter and G+, and there's more information about how our weekend went on our blog at blog.dressbetter.co.

Since we won StartupWeekend, it turns out the next step is something called ""Global Startup Battle,"" and we want to win! We will compete against teams from nearly 140 cities all around the world. If we can get in the top 15, our idea will get seen by some of the top names in the startup scene and help put Victoria startups on the map. But... to get in that top 15 we're going to need some help: the voting will be essentially a popularity contest so we are reaching out to all parts of the Victoria community for support!

How you can help:
1. Go to www.dressbetter.co and sign up to be reminded to vote during the voting period (Nov 21-27)
2. Share what we are doing with others who might help us with voting
3. Give us some feedback on where else we could be sharing this to help rally support by Wednesday!

  Little kids LOVE fire trucks so it would be incredibly amazing if someone would be willing to drop by with one. If that is not possible I would like a firefighter to come in uniform so the children could familiarize themselves with a full fire suit.

  The children I work with are 2.5 to 4 years old and this age group will sometimes hide during a fire because a fire suit can look scary. I would like to prevent that.

  Remember these kids are little and have the attention span of gnats. Short simple sentences and mentioning something they can relate to is all it takes to enthrall them. Which means any visit would be short (ie; we wouldn't take too much of your time).

I've been on reddit for some time now, love the people, love the community feel!  I've been working hard for the past year to launch my own business here in Victoria.  I've been working as a graphic and signage designer for the better part of the last 10 years, and finally decided to launch my own store out in the Westshore area.

I figured I would spread the word to local redditors who might have ties with local businesses or other people in need of vehicle wraps, signage, printing, website development, etc.

Take a look at our website to see everything we do: http://www.thesignpad.com

Also, a while back ""theoatmeal"" released his tumblr beasts artwork for people to use. Since I've always been a huge fan of theoatmeal, we paid tribute by having our server cabinet secured by his tumblr beasts!  Couple of funny pics below:

So from one Redditor to another, if you know any friends, family, business owners or co-workers who might need any one of our services, please send them our way! If you have any thoughts on the website or anything else, please let me know :)

I was on holiday from Australia and decided to head across to have a couple of Jiu Jitsu lessons.

I met an amazing girl on the charter bus, and we hung out that night. We went to an Irish pub, then to some smaller bar that has a whole bunch of bras hanging off the roof. We then met some awesome old welsh guy, and went to his houseboat for a while before I went back to the hostel. 

Me and the girl hung out again, she showed me around U Vic, we smoked, then got some amazing food.

Dry, old, tasteless, stale slices (didn't notice 'til I got home) served to me a by a less-than-hygienically-sound hipster across a horribly dirty counter which fronted a shop that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time.
 
And this was just the latest bad experience there.  Am I stupid?  Why did I go back?

I know there are many of you who will say you never liked Villages and some who will say you still love Villages, but I used to LOVE Villages Pizza.  I could get soy cheese if I wanted (lactose intolerant and fairly strict vegetarian), nice fresh toppings, tasty pizzas and friendly service.  

But something has happened...

Two weeks ago, walked into a Villages a to order a pizza and smelly hippie behind the counter tells me he's 'having a slow night and doesn't feel like making any more pizza'.  Seriously.  At 6:30PM.  He wouldn't make me a pizza.  Couldn't force him to, so I left.

Or the time a few weeks ago when little goth chick with infected facial piercings sneezed on the pizza she was cutting (not mine, thank dog!).

Or - here's my fave - last year, when I lived at a different home, I ordered some pizzas from them and then waited... and waited... for over an hour and a half and then called them only to be told that they didn't deliver in my area.  No phone call, no apology.  They took my order... and my address...? Wrote to the owner and got a credit, but still...

Anyway, 100% my fault for actually going back, but tonight's putrid feast was my last.

Anyone else having negative experiences? 

What's your favourite / least favourite pizza in town?



tl;dr:  Villages Pizza's quality is going seriously downhill, but I idiotically still ordered from them...  What's your fave pizza in town?

We were walking up Balmoral, turning onto Chambers. Two guys ran into us, trying to start a fight. One of them pulled out a switch blade. My friend was tackled to the ground and hit in the face. One of my other friends helped him up as the knife wielding man slashed at him. The handle of the knife connected with his eye as he turned to run. We ran to the police station a few blocks away and reported it, filled out forms etc. While we were there, two other groups of people showed up because of the same guys. One of them had a nasty cut on his hand. This was around midnight last night.

Just so you can avoid them, a brief description.
They were both Native, somewhere in their 20's. One was wearing a red hoodie with a large backback that was covered in plastic bags. He was 5' - 5'5'' (ish). The other was taller, around 5'10'', and wearing a grey hoodie.

For those of you who haven't heard yet, we now have a pretty reasonably sized FaceBook group - [check it out](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_190051364380898), 16 members in about 20 hours! This group will hopefully help us all keep track of Reddit/Victoria events, post photos of events, and just chat.

On another note, I was wondering if anyone's up for a June meetup? There is a FreeThinkers meetup on the 3rd, ~~so probably around the 17th-18th will be enough time to not be sick of Reddit.~~ Slider's has been suggested, but we could totally do something completely different and not even go eat/drink (sandcastles in the sand, anyone?). Please post your available and busy dates for the second half of June and any suggestions on what we could do! 

EDIT: June 25th is Global Reddit Meetup Day, how does that date work for y'all?

Tomorrow morning I leave Calgary, bound for Victoria.  I'm doing a beer tour.  I have evenings planned at Swann's, Canoe, Moon Under Water and Spinnakers.

Also, I'm hoping to hit a few liquor stores to find some brews that I can't get out here in Alberta.  I'm hoping for some recommendations on liquor stores to visit.  Specifically, I'm looking at buying up a bunch of those 650ml bottles and Growlers of some local Victoria breweries.

Any suggestions of stores to visit?

Been a while since we've had a meetup, so I have a couple questions to gauge interest and feasibility.

I was thinking it'd be nice to have a BBQ at a beach or park sometime next month. The idea is that someone would bring a BBQ, and someone would bring a bunch of food to grill (e.g. hotdogs, burgers, buns, condiments/dressings) and maybe other snacks. People could bring their own drinks/sides. We could just collect a bit of cash to pay for the fuel + grill food.

1. How does this idea sound? Do you think this set-up would be good, or should everyone bring their own stuff to grill? We could also assign each person something to bring, but no-shows could cause problems. :/

2. Does anybody know for sure where BBQs are allowed, and any restrictions on the type, etc? 

3. What days would work best for y'all?

4. Does anybody have a BBQ they could bring and (at least help) man?

5. Alternatively, can anyone host a BBQ at their place?

This was curious, as the tracking history shows they attempted delivery Friday morning, but I was home and the phone/buzzer didn't ring, and no sticker/slip was provided. As it was almost 4:30pm, I called Purolator to verify my packages were there, which they confirmed. She said Purolator has no Victoria office, only the one up in Saanich where Blanshard turns into the highway. She informed me I only had 15 minutes, and I said I could safely make it, no problem. 
As I pulled in at 4:59p.m. the lights were out, and they were heading towards the door.
I explained the situation, and she kindly took the extra minute to temporarily disable the alarm and get me my packages, what more could someone ask for? 
Just kidding, when she came out with her co-workers at 4:59p.m. she said, ""We just turned on the alarm, nothing we can do..."" and took the next several minutes to hug her co-workers and wish them happy holidays as I got back to my vehicle realizing they're closed for the next 2 days.

I found a white iphone (looks like a 4) in the parking lot at commonwealth pool today (dec 17th). I took it home, charged it and tried to call ""home"" but whoever owns it had already disabled it. 

I have called commonwealth pool and given them my number so if you would like to call them and ask for it they should give it to you so you can call me. If they refuse to give you my number for whatever reason then PM and we can go about things that way. 

I am scared of returning it to the wrong person only to have it jail broken so please be prepared to describe the home screen image. 

I am debating taking it to the police but I think that would probably decrease the chances of its owner tracking you down so I am going to hang on to it for a while longer and hope to hear from you.

Background
Family: Wife, 2 kids (5,2) (Canadians), me (American)
Current Home: Adelaide, Australia
Previous Home: Arizona, USA
Wife: Physician
Me: Remote technology worker

We've been living in Australia for the past two years and have decided it is time to get back to the northern hemisphere. We will be moving to Victoria around Jan/Feb 2013 and I was hoping to get some advise and feedback on some things. 

I've previously visited the island looking at possible destinations and we've narrowed our location to the greater Victoria area, specifically Oak Bay vicinity. 

I was hoping to get a rundown of the various neighborhoods around the area. We are looking for a nice quiet place to raise kids that has really good schools and the such. Recreational centers are a huge plus (like the Oak Bay Rec Center). As an aside, our kids speak French and we'd like to send them to either a French immersion school or a Francophone school, at least to start their education. I've heard there is a good Francophone school in Victoria? 

Our hobbies are outdoorsy in nature. Hiking, kayaking, and lake stuff are things we like for the kids/family. I'm personally quite into touch/flag football, basketball, weight lifting/fitness and getting into hockey (we are all taking skating lessons and I'm learning hockey). 

As for work, wife is a GP and we hear there is a shortage of docs on the island. Hoping this is true. Everything we've read says so, though hard to get a real answer on this :)

I'm a (remote) technologist; ruby, python, clojure, erlang etc etc. Typical jack of all trades kind of person. Would love to get a feel for what people are doing on the island. 

Another thing, if people are willing to share, I'd LOVE to see some pics that people have of the island. If people are willing to share albumn links that would be great! 

Thanks,
J


EDIT - 

Wow! Thanks for all the replies! I've got a few more neighborhoods to checkout and some pictures to go through this weekend. 

Thanks again! See you all in 2013 ;)",,False,self,t5_2rbsy,1348977520.0,,,True,t3_10lof7,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/10lof7/moving_to_victoria/,

A good friend of mine, Jaz, who owns Chef's Quest Cafe down on Yates, had a terrible accident while cooking and burned herself quite badly. It was doctors orders that she close the store ""until her face stops falling off"". 

Unfortunately, this means that with the two weeks of missed revenue, she might not be able to make bills this month. So! I turn to you, my fellow Redditors. Please come help another Redditor in need and come down to Chef's Quest from the 16th to the end of the month and eat her delicious food!

For those who don't know what Chef's Quest is, if you've ever been to Jackalope Bistro, Jaz bought it from the original owner and turned it into Victoria's first medieval burger joint while keeping the same menu items! Lots of delicious food for meat-lovers, vegetarians, and vegans.

So please come down and help me help Jaz and Chef's Quest!

Cheers,
Aki

So after some deliberation and some thinking figuring out the best for people, I think the best place to do it would be at Beacon Hill Park.  There is ample of free parking and nice grass areas for a PICNIC!  So bring a blanket and something for people to munch on because we are going out!  And don't worry for you evening Folk! The Reddit After Party will also be planned!!  But that will be released soon after this :)

**Picnic Details:**
**Where** - Beacon Hill Park (http://www.beaconhillpark.com/location.html) and Meet at the Cameron Band Shell! for those of you who dont know.. its the band shell inside the park (google it)
**When** - June 23rd @ 1PM
**What to bring** - I think Habachi Grills are ok in Beacon Hill Park but essentially this is a big ass potluck picnic!  Bring a Blanket to sit on (or chairs) plus something for people to eat (Please be foodsafe).  In addition bring a plate and cup for yourself! Sorry no alcohol here, its a public place.

Note: if you guys want to list what you are gonna bring, please do so here

CALL FOR FUN GAMES - Hey all you awesome event planners (Besides me), do you want to make some fun! Bring down a game for us to play and maybe we can get all the internet folk to join in!
BUSINESSES - Draw prizes?

AFTER PARTY - There will be an after party! Any Good Ideas?

Shifts are either the morning or the afternoon of the day of the event, for 4 hours. Available positions are: exhibition aide, information booth cashier, beer garden attendant, and parking attendant.

Volunteers will receive complimentary tickets toward food and drink at the festival so that they can enjoy themselves before/after their shift.

How's your Friday going? Those clouds in the sky making you sad? Well, I brought some of my Prairie sun with me when I moved out here a few weeks ago and thought i'd spread some to you. 

I bought three tickets to go see the above mentioned, and then realized its pretty much impossible to make it to Vancouver and back in time for stuff I have to do Monday. So instead of just letting these tickets go to waste or selling them, I'm passing them off to you! (Internet G, style)

Post a new reply in this thread indicating your favourite thing to do in this city and i'll randomly pick one of you.  The tickets are in .pdf fashion, so i'll just message you for your email address.

Unfortunately, no one witnessed the accident (don't worry it was minor with a few scratches and a dent on my car and some minor scratches on his car). Were any of you or people you know at Shelbourne and Mackenzie yesterday around this time that might have witnessed this?? It was between a silver nissan (his car) and a red honda civic si (my car). The jerk is now lying to ICBC saying I changed lanes into his car. Here is my statement for anyone who is interested:


I was leaving Thrifty foods (exit on Mackenzie Ave) and turned right onto Shelbourne St. from Mackenzie Ave, travelling north. After pulling onto Shelbourne St., I changed lanes into the left lane closest to the middle of the road, still travelling north. A silver Nissan car belonging to Mr. XX was pulling out of the University Heights Shopping Mall parking lot onto Shelbourne St. and was turning left. His intentions were to turn left onto Shelbourne street and also head in the North direction, the same direction as myself. As Mr. XX was pulling onto Shelbourne St. he hit the driver’s side door and left fender with the front bumper of his vehicle, as he was trying to get into the lane I was occupying. His passenger side front corner of his vehicle was also damaged in the process. Both vehicles have minor damage consisting mostly of scratches and one small dent on my driver door. Mr. XX and I pulled into the parking lot at The Kensington retirement village. We exchanged information, and while doing so he threatened me that he was going to try and make it seem like the accident was my fault and continued to try and place the blame on me, even though I had the right of way as I was through traffic and he was pulling out of the mall parking lot. His actual words were: “Well I’m going to make it your fault.” and “You better not make a claim with ICBC.”


If any of you know where I'm talking about on Shelbourne and Mackenzie, it's that weird little island, cubby thing that you can pull into before turning into traffic. It is located right before the driveway to the Kensington. Here is a link to my imgur album, maybe this will ring a bell for anyone who was around:




Oh and I lurked on this guy's facebook and his favourite things are Jersey Shore, Money, Weight Lifting, and MMA. If that is some more motivation to help me get this liar. He has a bunch of pictures of himself after a bar fight with black eyes. Such a tough guy! Anyways, any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks so much I know Reddit is awesome and will come through for me!

**UPDATE 1:** Well ICBC says it is looking good for me as they have caught him in a few lies. I'm still a bit worried they'll take the best route out for them which would be ""inconclusive evidence to support either claim, thus blame is 50-50"", like some of you have suggested. Also, I didn't mean to offend anyone with the jersey shore comments, just that it made sense for me when a 6""3 giant dude yells and tries to intimidate a 5""6 tiny chick. Now I understand why he thinks it's cool to get in bar fights and brag about it on FB. I just needed clarity for myself because I was shaking for like, 4 hours when I got home from this. Also, thanks for all of your support! I should find out what happens at the end of this week or early next week the final decision and will update you again for all of those who care :) Also, I removed the link to my album on the advice of some of you guys as I don't want anything linking back to me, if you catch my drift. Thanks again!

**UPDATE #2:** yay! ICBC didn't even need me to come in because a) my report made it very clear as to what happened and the damage to our vehicles coincided with what I said, and b) they caught the other guy in several lies and his story didn't make sense at all. His adjuster even called me to see if I was okay and felt safe after him threatening me. My adjuster thanked me for making her job easy with my report and told me to apply as a claims adjuster, lol. She was great. Thanks everyone you made me feel so much better! Money has been tight and I sure didn't want to get screwed over, especially over something I know I didn't do. I'm glad it worked out and he's paying for 100% of the damage!

I called the number back, and sure enough, got a real person on the line who was very upset about the fact that I had received this call from their name and number.

Today I got a call from someone 'returning a call from 5 minutes ago'. I didn't call anyone. It had to have been one of these calls coming from my number. 

Anybody else had this happen? What course of action should I take?
I've already called Rogers and they had nothing helpful just ""make sure you're on the no-call list"". That obviously does nothing...

A very important part of Relay is the celebration of those who have conquered cancer or are battling cancer currently. We honour them with a special reception before the event, by giving them a goodie bag, and by inviting them to take part in our Celebrate Ceremony which includes walking the first lap of Relay as a Victoria Lap.

We are currently trying to find different ways of reaching out to people in Victoria to welcome them to this event but our committee has a limited network so I thought I would give reddit a try. If you know anyone in Victoria who is a cancer survivor or who is battling cancer, we would love to have them out to our event so please share this.

&gt;Police in Saanich arrested a man after a string of suspected arsons last night -- that included a fire at the Accent Inn near Blanshard and Cloverdale that left the attached restaurant destroyed and forced hotel guests out of the building.

&gt;The first fire was a dumpster fire off Duplin Road a little before 10 o'clock last night. The the ABC restaurant at the Accent Inn went up in flames near 11 o'clock last night.

&gt;Acting Battalion Chief with the Saanich Fire Department Dale Peebles says flames were pouring through the metal roof of the building when he arrived.

&gt;""The restaurant was basically destroyed in this fire.""

&gt;One firefighter suffered an injury to his finger. All the hotel guests got out safely but could not return to their rooms.

&gt;**After the Accent Inn case two more suspected arson fires were lit in the Burnside Road East area around two o'clock this morning - one a garage fire and another small blaze on a property.

It was quite funny. The weather was pretty overcast in Alaska the entire time from Anchorage to Ketchikan, not to mention everyone in the towns we visited were really rude for the most part. Our fellow travellers were mostly American and equally unpleasant to be around.
We then went to Prince Rupert. It was as if we reached the promised land. The sun finally came out, the weather was beautiful and warm, and everyone on shore were so incredibly accommodating and friendly.
And Vancouver - beautiful city full of culture. I was so comfortable and happy travelling to the airport straight from the dock. I wish I could have spent some time looking around.

And then there was Victoria in Vancouver Island and I just fell in love. I love it so much here, in fact, that I am strongly considering doing a year at Victoria University just so I can stay here for an extended visit. I'm sad I am only here for 2 days.

I'll start of by doing a TLDR(summary); worst meal in town where is it?

My son and I have had an annual tradition since he was about 12 years old to go out to the uggliest dingiest restaurants in our hometown (Kelowna) and eat the most unappetizing plates of food. Why? Because when my son was younger he would complain so often- begging for my wife(his step mom) and I to take him out for dinner. His birth mom fed him lots of fast food because she thought that it was an appropriate way to get my son to like her more then me (sigh). In order to punish his attitude I started taking him to the worst looking places in town and ordering the grossest food for a few weeks straight, until he started to beg for home cooked meals. Now once every few months we commemorate those times by setting out to find the worst restaurants and order for each other what we think is the grossest plate on the menu. I just moved to Victoria and quite simply every restaurant I see or check out is absolutely lovely. If any one can comment or message me what are some of the worst places to eat in town, it'd be much appreciated as my son is coming to visit this upcoming week.

Everything is going well, until they ask me to set up a username and password for my bank account.

One thing you should know:  I used to work in a job where security was super, super important.  While there, I learned to use really, really, secure passwords. Like, fifteen digit random strings of characters and digits that are different for every system I had to use. I still use that method for really, really, important web sites.  Internet banking is one of those really important websites.

So, the nice lady -- whom I don't blame at all. I mean, she's just doing what she was told -- says I have to pick a password that is seven digits.


**Seven Digits**

No letters, no numbers, no special characters.

Just seven digits.  A total key space of 9,999,999. 

When I was a kid we used to hack into Camosun's VAX/VMS system with our 2400 baud modems so we could use this new-fangled thing called the Internet. They used to require only an 8 letter password.   It was easy; 8 letters took my 386 PC  only a few days to break...

But, this is 2013 and a **fucking bank** is asking me to use a **7 DIGIT** password.

Have you heard of  World of Warcraft?  It's a really popular game. Lots of people like to hack their site and so they need additional security for their **fake money that doesn't mean anything**. 

Blizzard offers *Authenticators.*  These are either physical FOB's that you attach to a key chain or applications you run on your phone that change your password every few seconds.

You know, because your fake World of Warcraft gold and characters are important and deserve some enhanced security.

My bank? My Fucking **BANK**? Where I keep my money?!!?  You think they offer FOB's?

The teller -- and again, I'm not blaming her, really. She seemed like a nice person -- helpfully tells me that seven digits is the same length as a phone number.

A **phone number**

Hey, kids: If you happen to find someone's coat or purse on the ground and they have a phone and a Coast Capital bank card you can:

A)  Log into their account because **the username for their account is the same as the number on their bank card for fuck sake**  You know, the username: The first line of defence. It's on the fucking card with the company name.

B) Use the numbers in their phone as their password: Their number, their parents number, their boyfriends number,  or can look up the number they had growing up as their password. (Not hard to find with their full name....)

But, but but, you need their Mother's Maiden name, school they went to as a child, or father's middle name.. 

Which you can check on Facebook since you have their phone. 

Holy crap.

Anyhow.  Sorry to bother you with my rant.  But they **REALLY** need to fix the security for their website.

Seriously.

You can also find some farm gate sales directly from the Mitchell's Farm Market on Island View Road, but they sell out quick, trust me.
For larger orders such as a side or quarter, try going direct from farms, such as mine [McNulty Manor](www.facebook.com/mcnultymanor).

I am applying to a PhD program at UVic for Fall 2012.  I have no idea if I have been accepted, but I am extremely hopeful about it and really love the thought of living in Victoria.  I have been searching through this sub-reddit to see if anyone has had a similar experience, but I have not found anyone with my dilemma.  

I am a US citizen, currently living in Texas, but originally from North Carolina.  This would be my first time moving to Canada.  I understand it would not be very hard to get a student visa, but my boyfriend would also be moving with me (plus our dog) and I am wondering if it is hard for him to get a work visa.  Has anyone had this experience?  We are planning to get married one day, but we are in absolutely no rush, but I was wondering if anyone knew if it would be easier for him to get a work visa if he and I were married?  

If anyone can offer any advice, I would really appreciate it.  I think your city seems spectacular- hope to be there soon!  

edit: Hi everyone.  I wanted to thank all of your for being so helpful!  I have actually learned a lot and have begun going through numerous steps that have been suggested.

I have decided to take on a personal challenge, to create 30 fun / random / incidental pieces of 'Art' (one a day for a month) and leave them in spots around Victoria. I'm using various things I have around my apartment to try to create some randomness around our city.

I will be documenting the process and have made an e-mail address for people who find these pieces to share their stories.

Tomorrow I will be placing the first piece and posting the location in this thread. 

I'm hoping some Redditors will search them out! 

The ideas for the pieces are as follows:

1. 'Build Me!' - lexan 3d puzzle box w/ glue and instructions (location TBD)
2. 'Race Me!' - 2 toy cars, one beach racetrack (Modeled after F1 great, Monaco)
3. 'Plant Me!' - Small aloe vera plant left in a pot
4. 'Frame Me!' - A picture I took, left in a envelope
5. 'Fly Me!' - Homemade kite
6. 'Fight Me!' - Two homemade wire figures
7. 'Paint Me!' - Canvas and paints
8. 'Assemble Me!' - Half finished car model
9. 'Solve Me!' - Drawn maze
10. 'Collect Me!' - Wooden figurine
11. 'Read Me!' - A book from my bookcase
12. 'Listen to Me!' - Random Songs on a cd
13. 'Watch Me!' - Ted talks / Planet earth ... maybe some Top Gear on a Dvd
14. 'Easy Me!' - That was easy button
15. 'Hustle With Me!' - Pool cue


I haven't come up with any other ideas as of yet, so if you have any please comment!

For those of you who haven't experienced it... it's not traffic or aircraft, it's an extremely deep sub-sonic rumble that will sometimes seem to come from the sky but usually seems to come from below.  It will last 40 secs to a minute and then fade away.  Some days it will go on all day and some days it won't happen at all.

I have lived just north of Elk Lake for two years now and the rumbling comes and goes but recently has been getting much deeper and louder.

It's crazy.  My cats are freaking out as I write this.

I've heard some theories: geological activity or the Sidney airport (sorry folks, nothing takes off or lands in Sidney that makes THIS kind of noise.  I've also heard that it comes from a US airforce base located on the other side of the Strait of Georgia.  There is one, but it's close to 80kms from here... unless they're landing large spacecraft, I highly doubt that's the cause...

The Times Colonist also did a story on the sound, but the page has been taken down...

Anyone out there experience this?

Tudor House called the firefighters to have them inspect the building following a strange smokey smell notification.  They came, and found nothing.

They called again the next day (or a couple of day later) for the same reason.  They came again, and again found nothing, notifying the caller that if they were called a third time for the same reason they wouldn't come back.

The night the Tudor house burned down, they indeed got a call, but did not come.  The house burned down.

Later, the firefighters hired their own demolition company to destroy the remains, instead of having it done through the owner's own hired demo company.  No inquiry, no proof, done, destroyed.

Can anyone confirm?

This sucks as my bike was my only form of transportation and I rode it everywhere! Here is a picture of what it looks like [Trek 1400](http://www.bikejournal.com/images/ryangIMG%20198.jpg). This is what it looks like but not actually my bike.


Here are the specs:

Type: Road Bike

Make: Trek

Model: 1400

Frame: 56 cm, aluminum

Colour: Red

Brakes: Press

Gears: 10 speed

Distinguishing features: has [toe clips](http://0.tqn.com/d/bicycling/1/0/N/1/-/-/pedalclips.jpg) on the pedals, black [bike rack](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Cycling/PanniersBagsRacks/Racks/PRD~1805-118/mec-mountain-rear-cycling-rack.jsp) on the back, water bottle holder on the bottom bar, black tape around the handle bar, clips on the handle bar where I clip in my bike computer and head light, and a female bike seat. I also had a sticker/label on the bar (the one that says aluminum in the picture) that had my name and telephone number on it - this has probably been scratched off, but was pretty sticky so I'd imagine there might be some residue still.


Anyways, I made a report with the police and the file number is 13-245. I also work for various homeless shelters downtown and put the word out with some of the clients there.

As you may or may not be aware, the Times Colonist now requires website visitors to pay to view articles on their website after so many free views per month. The announcement from the Times Colonist can be found [here](http://www.timescolonist.com/Subscriptions+timescolonist/4845573/story.html), although it appears to apply to all newspapers within the Postmedia Network Publications.

Personally I don't really feel the website for the Times Colonist offers enough to warrant pay-to-view structure. I'd like to elaborate upon my reasons for this sentiment, but I would prefer Reddit weigh in with the pros and cons of such a system, and personal opinions, to begin with.

**EDIT:** It seems the majority of Redditors are inclined to agree, there is no good reason for the Times Colonist to adopt a 'pay to view' structure. Hopefully the Times Colonist changes their gameplan.
