My response to the original post:

Should you leave your husband? Yes. Like Whatsupdoc25 said, get out before you end up in a body bag. (Sorry if that is crude. I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but as a fellow lady Redditor, I am worried about you.)

It seems like a ton of mental and verbal abuse from H. You deserve better than that! Listen to your friends. This guy sounds like he sucks. 

I volunteer with a women's center in my area and [this is what the center defines as domestic abuse.] (http://www.hawc.org/site/c.9hJJL0MDK8KWE/b.7883819/k.7AE5/What_is_Domestic_Violence.htm)

&gt; I'm not allowed to see friends and family. If I bring up that I'm not allowed to he corrects me by saying that he doesn't ban me from seeing them, they are just bad people.
He is a manipulator. Your family and friends love you. Your husband is controlling you. People who control you DO NOT love you. 

However, I don't want to pressure you to do one thing or the other. This is your choice and you should be comfortable with whatever you decide. 

Please, please, please call the center. These are the numbers: *Domestic Violence Hotline  (713) 528-2121

1364085007.0,30,self.ihaveissues,1avzpb,I'm a 17 year-old female and I am hearing and seeing things that other people do not see. Is it just my imagination or is this an early sign of a more serious disorder?,anakedape,36,6,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1avzpb/im_a_17_yearold_female_and_i_am_hearing_and/,"I have several issues already, none of which have been diagnosed as I've never been truthful with my psychiatrists. However, I am starting to wonder if it is a good idea to be more open now that I am seeing and hearing things. It used to be that I would just ""imagine"" children laughing. This would happen very rarely but periodically even as a small girl. I did not hear them laughing external to myself but it was a very vivid internal thing in my mind. Now within the past few months I have been seeing strange things external to myself. I will provide a few examples. 

1. I was in a bathroom stall changing out of my workout clothing when I dropped a ring on the floor. On contact with the tile, the floor rippled outward as would waves if someone had dropped a pebble in a body of water. When I looked at the source directly, the waves disappeared. I dropped the ring again to test for similar effects but there was no recurrence.

2. I was walking home from school with a friend when the sidewalk began to stretch width-wise, pushing the wooden curb on opposite sides of the road towards the buildings on my right. It threw me off balance significantly, and I stopped mid-stride and hurriedly asked my friend if he had experienced the same thing. He had not. The sidewalk did not stretch for a lengthy period of time, and as with the ring example above, it immediately halted upon direct observation.

3. I was walking in a national park late at night with another friend. We were up to some trouble so I was nervous, and I would like it to be noted that this may be a cause of what I experienced. Walking along the path there are trees on the right side which are fairly tall and dense for a man-made park. I was gazing into the trees looking for movement of animals or people alike, but did not notice any until there was a large shift in the dark colors of the surroundings within the trees. It was as if someone had manipulated a background layer on a digital image so that a tall, wide, dark portion was moved sideways and was snapped back to its original location. I jumped at this time and attempted to explain my actions to my friend, who had not seen the strange shift.

4. A few nights ago I was lying awake in my bed staring at the objects around my room, attempting to see them as real objects instead of animals (I will explain this later) when I noticed that they appeared significantly shorter than what I remembered them to be. My bed seemed to be pulled to the floor so that it was very low to the ground, and the other objects in my room followed suit. The strange part is I did not observe them shrinking- I did not see an immediate shift- it was as if I had observed them at their normal dimensions but looked away, and upon returning my gaze they had shrunken, but this was not the case as I was observing them steadily the entire time. It is hard to explain. 


My examples may seem to present the case as cut-and-dry, as it were, however I have always had a very active and vivid imagination which makes me question my experiences. As a child I imagined a plethora of frightening things, such as marching soldiers of which I could hear, internally, the rhythmic beating of their drums and marching, coming towards my bedroom. They were often heard mumbling and chanting incoherent things to me. I introduced above the experience of viewing the objects in my room as animals. I am taken to understand this is a common occurrence for children, and indeed it happened every night as a girl. However I still experience this phenomenon, and occasionally the objects in my room will move towards me or even out of my line of vision. This also happens with shadows or other wispy figures quite often, and I will see different figures fleeing from my vision down the hallways of my home, under the couches, and into the ceiling. It is very frightening, and because of these things I have slept in my mother's bed until I was 14.

I have also been hearing, for approximately a year, my name being called just over my right shoulder. My name is usually called only once per occurrence, and it varies from a slow, drawn-out call to a very quick muttering. It is usually quiet, as if us two were in a large room and were speaking at a low volume in an intimate way. It is not at all malicious and I am not frightened when this happens, but it is nonetheless troubling. Occasionally I will hear another person's name being called, next to my ear, just over my right shoulder. 


**TL;DR occasionally I observe strange shifts in my environment which other people do not experience, and my name is also said to me at different intervals each month. I have always had a strong imagination so I am wondering if these events are simply a magnified extension of a vivid childhood imagination, or a serious disorder such as schizophrenia.** ",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_1avzpb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1avzpb/im_a_17_yearold_female_and_i_am_hearing_and/,

I crave companionship, but social situations make me feel like my energy is expended after a while. I wish I enjoyed socializing, but no matter what I do, I can't seem to convince myself that people I meet are worth my time after talking for a bit. I simply don't feel like I can connect with most people I meet. After a little while in social situations, I look forward to holing myself up in my room and playing guitar. I communicate with people well and they tend to like me, but communication doesn't feel like a natural process to me, more like a machine analyzing the situation and acting in ways that will produce optimal results for me. I rarely enjoy my interactions with people. 

Girls have always been attracted to me, and a lot of them show signs of interest fairly quickly. I want a girlfriend, but I do not like how the vast majority of girls act, only how they look. 

It has always felt like I've been in my own isolated world apart from everyone, and like I have to tear down sturdy walls before I can connect with people. I have a few close friends, and many acquaintances as a result. I have always felt like a ""different breed"" of sorts, with different programming that results in me having difficulty connecting to others. No one can tell this about me, because I'm externally confident, goofy, and charismatic, but it feels like a facade that I put forth in order to yield optimal results. 

I hate school, and prefer to learn at my own pace. When I take classes I am interested in, the deadlines make me feel as if learning is a chore, and the more classes I take about things I am interested in, the more I look forward to never thinking about the material again because it makes me feel forced to study something I like. I hate feeling like I am only considered smart if a piece of paper issued by my university says so, and only considered good at something if my teacher gives me an A.

",oviiithrowaway,28,3,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/xrju9/i_24f_used_to_be_an_escort_now_im_dealing_with/,"I was an escort a few years ago. No sex, just dinner, blow-jobs, and stripping. There were a lot of situations where I was almost raped, forced to do things I didn't want to do, had more than $500 stolen at a bachelor party and had my faith in men destroyed. A man poured liquor in my eyes at a bachelor party once to blind me while I was grouped by dozens of men against my will. 

I had forgotten about it - and the only effect I dealt with was a split personality regarding my sexuality. In every sexual situation I'd be in, I wouldn't know if it was ""me"" or ""Lexi,"" - did I want to be there? For instance, I was getting a massage at a massage parlor once and it turned very sexual. I played along with it, moaned, breathed heavy - obviously leading the guy on. But then I had a moment of clarity, realized what I had done, felt like I was almost raped and got extremely upset. It wasn't the *real* me, I just felt like my hyper-sexual alter had come out. 

But when I was drunk recently, I accidentally confessed to a guy I was dating what I used to do. Since then, it's all I think about. I remember every terrible situation that happened and it's made me very depressed and uneasy. Even during escorting, I was never this upset about it. I feel so fucked up. Granted, I have lots of other problems, but this is affecting me so much that I can't function anymore. I'd rather just lay in bed where nothing can touch me.  Of all things, I don't understand why this is happening now? I was fine until I told the guy, now I can't get it out of my head.

thats the article^ ""warning signs of a loser"".
It helped me realize what i was doing to my girlfriend. 
I currently have more then ten of those symptoms, and i feel fucking hopeless.

*Throwaway account*

I swear I love my girlfriend.. and if there was a button that would change who I am so I no longer act the way I do, I would press it in a heart beat.

I'm tired of hurting her.. I see how tired and worn down she looks after having to deal with my episodes. I hate myself because of it, but I just can't change. I'm a fucking manipulator. I only now realize this after another redditor posted that list in a popular thread. 

I'm incredibly paranoid and jealous.
I force her to push friends and family away.
When im angry I chip away at her self esteem.
I blame my outbursts on her.
I display fucking insane behaviour (driving recklessly, spouting death threats) 
I dont stop till I get my way.
And I'm a hypocrite because I dont follow the same rules I place on her.
I log on to her facebook with out her permission.
I go through her texts..

And when my fucking mood swing is over.. i look at her, and i see the tears in her eyes, and i see how she still loves me and wants to hug me. just hug the angry monster away. And i break down and cry because i know deep inside that its my OWN fucking fault. I AM A FUCKING MONSTER.. and all i can do is apologize and make promises i know i cant keep because i cant stand the thought of her leaving me. 

I wake up and see that she's not the same bubbly, beautiful, innocent girl, i first fell in love with.. but someone who lives in fear and constantly looks more and more burnt out.

Ive taken up drinking quite a bit.. i find that it mellows me out and i become a much nicer person. I let my feelings out and i tell her i love her. But when im not drinking, i become very irritable, depressed, and suicidal.

the thing that ways on my conscious the most:
 Is that I took her virginity. I took her first kiss. I was her first everything.

And i manipulated and persuaded her into letting me do so..
 So her innocent and naive heart doesnt want to leave me because in her mind: Im the one. She was saving all of those things for the man she married, and instead she gave them to some asshole.

I love her so much.. and i want to marry her.. and i want to spend my life with her.. but im just so scared im going to push her and everyone else forever away.

how can i fucking stop myself from destroying this girl or any other future relationships?

 We've been together two years now and we live together. I love her more than anything else in the world but she has issues. Her dad committed suicide when she was a kid. She has severe anxiety along with abandonment issues. She also has some pretty deep self esteem and body image issues. I try everyday to help and I am extremely extremely patient but she always seems to make her issues the forefront of everything excusing whatever she does with them and I deal with it and deal with it but I can never be angry or she insists that I hate and am going to leave her despite never ever once even implying I would ever leave. And it gets so I start resenting that and then we have a big crying spectacle that takes two hours for me to try to tell her how I feel before she goes right back to acting how she always does. And I know she loves m and that this is just as hard for her as it is for me to deal with but it sucks that I can never be mad at her and can never criticize her without it being a huge deal.

 As for the college thing I was an idiot and fucked around in high school because I was just a dumb kid and now despite having scored a 2280 out of 2400 on the SAT I can't get into college because I can't get scholarships or loans because my dad hasn't paid his taxes in years and nowhere is going to offer me a full ride with the 2.0 GPA I graduated with. I'm not that same dumb kid and I wish I wasn't judged now for shit I did as a fucking highschooler.

 I had a job I hated to my very core and was recently fired from for having a poor internet connection (I worked from home.) And now I can't find another job because I am not experienced enough. and jesus I just want some advice or someone to talk to. I think this anonymity works for me because I hate asking for help but I just feel lost and desperate and I don't know about anything anymore because I always thought I would always have my relationship but it's struggling and I just don't know anymore.

 There's also my childhood and the fact that I was pretty badly abused, physically and mentally. I hate talking about it and I say and pretend like I'm over it and I don't care but I am terrified of being my parents, who I think would have been much better off getting divorced but are still together and still a toxic violent relationship. and this just feels like so much shit for me to deal with. so advice or help or anything really would be awesome.

Due to the medication and the mobility issues, I gained about 70 lbs, but I recovered from the majority of my disability by the time I was 22. However, it snowballed into depression and failed diet attempts, and I slowly gained more weight over the years. I ended up being 350 lbs by the time I was 30. My hormones were out of control, and I grew a full beard as a result. I'd pluck and shave for about 2 hours every day, but it was so hard to keep up with it, staring at a face I didn't want to see in the mirror every day... it destroyed my self-esteem.

I also had destructive and abusive ""friends"" during this time in my life because I was desperate for socialization and I took what I could get. I convinced myself that I was somehow privileged to be their friend. In reality, they kept me around to make themselves feel better and because I was easy to abuse since I hated myself too. 

In a last ditch effort, I took control of my life and got removed myself entirely from those abusive relationships, and I've since lost 170 lbs as well. I'm still losing weight, but I'm at a very ""normal"" size. I'm comfortable, but I want to lose another 30 lbs ideally and it *will* happen, though all of my comorbidities are already gone, and I feel so much better now. I even had laser hair removal and got rid of all of my facial hair. The difference was staggering.... mind numbing really. When I actually took the time to look at the reduced hair on my face, and my thinner face, I cried. I had forgotten what I looked like. I started taking better care of myself, too. I learned to use make-up at 32, though I only use light foundation. Still, I had forgotten.

People treat me like I'm *normal* too. I even look pretty good, i guess... I apparently look very young. I get carded all the time, and all of my coworkers and classmates think I'm in my low 20s. I don't discourage this thought, but I don't lie about it and it doesn't come up much anyway. This is actually genetic in my family, my teachers used to think my mom was my older sister, even though she's 25 years older than me. 

I'm also doing much better now in terms of depression and anxiety, though it lingers. I doubt it will ever fully resolve, but it has gotten so much better. I don't take any medications now aside from vitamins, though sometimes I wonder if I should take something for my anxiety!

So here's the thing. While I was big, no one wanted me, not even myself. Now that I'm almost normal in size, I've been asked out a couple times. I have politely declined because I did not like the guys who asked; we had nothing in common, and they were too young (18yo and 20yo) and not very serious, and I don't like their personalities very much, and they weren't interested in being friends first. I was super flattered though, and it gave me a confidence boost and alerted me to the fact that guys are looking at me now...

I just turned 33 last week, and I'm still, well, a virgin. The last boyfriend I had was when I was 16, and we didn't do anything more than a simple kiss. I didn't even masturbate til I was 27, and even then it was all external since I have a particularly resilient hymen (can't even use tampons) and, well, I didn't exactly want to force the issue and become totally disinterested. My hormonal issues already made me disinterested in sex, and I decided to try to masturbate at 27 just to see if it would help. It resolved my sleeping disorder, but since I guess a lot of that is mental, I wasn't in the mindset to just enjoy it. These days I do enjoy it more because I don't hate myself, quite simply, but it's still external anyway. Kinda worried about the pain, I'll be real, and I've waited so long I have no idea what to do about it. Was thinking of getting my doctor to perforate the hymen so the idea of pain is out of the way.

It's also kind of hard to read people since I feel like I'm in a new society now. It's hard to explain, but I just really feel like an alien because people treat me so differently now. I mean, they hold doors open for me, they smile at me, they look at me when they talk to me. When you're big, people can really be so cruel and they don't even realize it. They avoid you like fat is contagious and you're patient Zero.

Anyway, there's a guy at work and I think he likes me, which is really amazing since I liked him since I first met him on my first day. My standard defense has been not to think about guys, because they never think about me like that, so why get my hopes up? I've been living in the dark for so long that I forgot where the light switch was. So when he started to sort of try to get to know me, I was shocked.

This guy has gone out of his way to approach me, which is kind of weird since I'm a somewhat new hire and I'm really quiet. He invited me out with coworkers, then to a regular outing with coworkers, he sometimes sits next to me during meetings even when there are seats free everywhere, he sought me out at the company get-together even though I was sort of hiding. He asked one of my close coworkers at the get-together if I was old enough to go out for drinks sometimes. He smiles at me a lot. People smile at me often, but not really this consistently. He also brings me candy and stuff sometimes, which is kinda funny since I'm very strict about what I eat, but I always accept and eat a little, toss the rest without him seeing. Maybe I'm seeing too much into this and he's just a cool dude to everyone, but I don't know because I'm new there and I'm not good at people.

I like him quite a bit too, but I have no idea how to react. I just smile and try to be myself, but I'm terrified. If I'm misreading it, I'll feel pretty foolish and I'm worried I'll go back into social hiding. It's like Groundhog Day and I'm worried that I'll see my shadow and run back to my den for months.

**tl;dr**: 

* I'm a virgin and I'm worried that will scare off guys because they will think I'll get super attached or something. Also the hymen thing. So embarrassing. I've only heard horror stories and I can't imagine it being fun for the guy either. No idea what to do.

* I lost a lot of weight and have excess skin. It's actually not too bad, but my boobs aren't as perky as my bra would indicate, and I've got some wrinkled areas and I'm not a hardbody and can't be without surgical reduction. I do plan to get skin reduction surgery though, but not until I'm done losing weight... probably in a year. Saving money already, and I have a surgeon ready to go, basically.

* I'm worried if the guy realizes my age, he will run because for some reason it's more acceptable for the guy to be vastly older than the girl, but not visa versa? I don't know. The guy that I like is approximately 28, so he's 4-5 years younger than me. I don't want to hide my age, but I certainly don't want to bring it up in any way. 

* I'm still very socially awkward and quiet. The guy at work is kind of the opposite. He has a lot of friends, so I'm thinking maybe he's just being nice. I don't know how to figure out if he likes me. I think he does though, I'm oblivious but not dead.

I feel like I should already know how to date someone and begin a romantic relationship. I just don't know how to do any of this and that scares the shit out of me.

I don't consider myself a ""shy"" person, except when I'm talking with a girl (which usually never happens unless I need to talk with her i.e. she works at a gas station or grocery store). I'm kind of uncomfortable with small talk because I think its boring and inane, and I'm bad at it. In the event that I'm having a conversation with a girl, I usually end up just trying to be friendly, with me not pursuing anything deeper than being a casual acquaintance. I just don't know how. I don't know what to do. Fuck fuck FUCK FUCK FUCK. I need help.

Sorry if this doesn't make any sense, it's 2am and I just really need to get these things out. There's probably more that I've forgotten to write.

1359701629.0,16,self.ihaveissues,17olkf,I get upset when he doesn't send me a goodnight text because we've been doing it for so long that i feel like it's a part of my life now,twitchwitches,19,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/17olkf/i_get_upset_when_he_doesnt_send_me_a_goodnight/,"Here's the background: I'm 19f, he's 17m. We're long distance, i don't get to see him every day, and he usually sends me a gnight text that says i love you and i do the same to him. 

We got into a fight yesterday and when i said gnight i love you he didn't respond, then we were texting today but then he just stopped responding and i said gnight but he just never responded. I was afraid to say i love you because i know how much it hurts when he doesn't say it back. That would be my key issue, getting extremely worried about something like texting and thinking there's a deeper meaning to things. I just tend to have a people pleaser kind of attitude, i've noticed it, i'll admit it on here. I look deeply into almost everything that people say, whether it's meant to be deep or not. I've had to go on medication recently and i feel like i've nearly ruined our relationship because of my mood swings and fears that he's cheating on  me. 

Now this is a rational fear, but the way that i felt the fear was irrational and scary because i would just start crying or pull all nighters just thinking about it and it tore me apart, ripped up my self esteem. It left practically none of me and i'm getting myself back piece by piece with this new medication and i'm trying to change my ways but it's so hard, it really is. I just want him to respond, because it's a terrible feeling to be left hanging when you say i love you.

I havent settled into college life the way i thought i would either so i feel as though i'm clinging to him and every person i left at home, and i know it's bad but its so hard not to. I want to be able to stay in the moment and not fret about him all the time, but i love him so much and i'm so new to relationships that just being in one seems to take over my life; whether i want it to or not. I'm practically scared of my own friends at school, i get very anxious, it's hard to tell from the outside but i'm always afraid i'm gonna say something that makes them think i'm fucked up and i sometimes worry tat theyre only friends with me out of pity and it's scary as shit to think about. It makes me want to hide in my room and talk to my best friend, who's in a different state, and my boyfriend. I just feel so different day by day that i don't know how to relate or get comfortable around new people. That's why i was hoping the meds would help and i would stop tearing myself apart every time he doesn't send an i love you text, or she doesn't ask me how my day was. I feel jealous of everyone that gets to be around people that they have known their whole lives because sometimes things just feel so unreal here and i keep getting so dumbfounded that i'm in college and have met so many new faces that it overwhelms me to the extreme. 

So i guess that this goes a little deeper than a text, but the main thing i'll just make short and sweet:
TL:DR: bf usually sends gnight text, didn't send any two nights in a row, i look for a deeper meaning in everything, it ruins my life.

UPDATE: It turned out his phone was just broken, go figure, but about two days after te phone started working he sent me a text that made me freak out and then he called me needy, so i decided that in order to prove to myself that i wasn't needy i would go without texting him for a week. We were supposed to see eachother that weekend so i thought it wouldn't be so bad, but then he said he got sick and he couldn't go so the third day in i broke down to my friend and then i decided no, i wasn't going to quit i had to do it.

 It turned out to be one of the happiest, scariest weeks ever for me because yes, i missed him like hell, but i was so much more in the moment when i knew that i just didn't have the ability to text him. It was a week before valentines day too, so when we finally did see each other it was like a glorious reunion in a way. They do say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it's definitely true. You see how well you can do without the person but you also see how important they are to you and realize that you really want them to be a part of your life. I say want because need sounds scary, though sometimes i really feel like i do need him i am still trying not to feel that way.

 I haven't been as happy for the last week because of other family things going on and i've started taking a medication and mixed it with alcohol, which is a horrible thing to do. Other than that i think i've been doing a lot better with enjoying my life even when he isn't here, but i still want to see him and miss him intensely sometimes. I think that because of how obsessive i was sin the beginning of the year i lost a few friends that i really liked, thought that i loved, and i'm really sorry for that.

 I wish that i adjusted to college life a little better, than i'd still be friends with those people and be more confident in myself and my body and possibly trust my boyfriend not to cheat on me which is still a constant fear i'm trying to feel better about. I'm not very happy with where i am right now because i know that i really fucked up earlier this year, but i'm also accepting that there isn't anything that i can do to change it and frankly i should be happy with where i am. I have a boyfriend. I have a passion for what i want to do with my life. I have a clue of what i want to do with my life. I have a family that supports me and my sister when we're struggling, even when i'm being horrible and bitchy and undeserving of their help. I have friends who i love and although sometimes i'm scared that they don't love me as much as i love them i'm still grateful that they let me hang out with them. I have pretty blue eyes. I have the ability to walk. 

Basically, i was in a horrible mood before so i'm writing things that make me happy so that i can pick myself up without having to cry on my friends' shoulders because i do that a lot. I do it so much that i've become self centered. All you need to know is, i'm getting better but it's slow. I'm independent but i still depend on people. I'm sad more often than others so when i depend it's intense and it drives them away, but i swear things are looking up and i'm less clingy.",,False,,t5_2s90u,1361934276.0,,,True,t3_17olkf,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/17olkf/i_get_upset_when_he_doesnt_send_me_a_goodnight/,

1366408807.0,18,self.ihaveissues,1cpbk5,This is a description of a super toxic relationship pattern I've caused and seen others in. Sharing to help others identify if its their or their SO's pattern. Mod pre-approved.,nothingbutme1221,18,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1cpbk5/this_is_a_description_of_a_super_toxic/,"I know the this isn't the usual format for a post to this sub. I got the post pre-approved by a moderator.

The following is relationship pattern I’ve been in and seen others in. Its super toxic for everyone involved. I feel awful thinking about it and just wanted to share my experience so that maybe someone else can identify what they’re doing/involved in.

I feel like I need to mention somewhat upfront for context is that a lot of my ex's had low self esteem and I can be very attentive and caring in the initial stages of a relationship. Also, I tend to develop strong feeling towards certain types of girls early, so as clinical as the analysis that follows is, I did care deeply about these girls. The previous three things are what I think enabled to the following pattern to occur.

Basically, I like things pleasant and have an extraordinarily hard time making demands of others. I don't like drama or arguments, So when something was wrong I would ignore it. I wouldn't get passive aggressive, just disengaged. When confronted I would insist that everything was fine and there was nothing wrong. They would try to pull closer to me to try and fix things, which was impossible because I refused to discuss what was wrong or bring myself to make demands on my SO.

This only made things worse because I tend to need a lot of personal space to recharge. Of course this is not something I mentioned to them. So I would become more detached, which in turn escalated my SO's neediness.

Enter fake or over dramatic crises. This too was in part my fault. I have some issues related to my conception of what being ""a man"" is. One of these is that it was my job to help and comfort a SO through rough times. So I would go all out on being there for them and emotionally present and connected. However after helping them through said crisis, I would feel burnt out and detach further. Enter another crisis to regain my attention. Repeat.

After awhile of this, I would become very detached because it felt like anytime I was around my SO's, I would be playing emotional clean up crew and I was burnt out. However, I wouldn't want to break up with them because it appeared to me (I was dumb and didn't see the situation for what it actually was) that they were going through all sorts of issues and needed me for support. Which, to a certain extent they did because the past 9-10 month of dealing with me drove them to a spectacularly bad place emotionally.

So now were dating, but I'm quiet trying to find exit options over the horizon when there in a better place emotionally. That horizon doesn't happen because the crisis's are either fake (1 ex) or more the result of the slow emotional breakdown I've set in motion than actually issues (2 exs). Things get ugly, but neither of us are break up with each other and we don't fight it out about the actually issues because I try to smooth things over and we both exist in a state of emotional exhaustion.

(Optional step) Cheating. Not on my part. However, as I've managed to create a black hole of neediness in the other person which I can no longer contain on my own, they turn outward for comfort. Next, they would either feel awful about themselves and what they were doing and confess or I would catch them. All the unsaid drama of the past 6 months explodes into a cataclysm of fighting and I break up with them. They want to get back together and act crazy about it.

If that step doesn't occur. Then Eventually I crumble under the stress of trying to ""help"" them and I break up with them. They want to get back together and act somewhat crazy about it.

This process played out three times in my life each time over a period of 12-16 months. The only thing I will say in my defense is that I had zero clue about how all of the interaction fit together and didn't see the patterns of my own actions.

Tl;dr Accidentally engaged in a pattern of behavior in relationships of mixed signals and poor communication combined whereby I slowly drove my partners off the deep end.

	If the people you date keep going crazy, you should to take a look at yourself.

",launchfailuremaximum,19,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/15eyuz/29mtired_of_parents_yelling_negativity_and/,"I'm visiting my parents in another state. Since I've been here, they, specifically my mother, has been yelling non-stop at my siblings. If something is out of place, she sees it as everyone else in the house being disrespectful to her, that sh'es the only person who has to do work around here, no one cares or thinks about her, and we're all just spoiled.

I mentioned that I gained some weight tonight, that I worked too hard to let this happen again, and that I've gone into eating poorly because I've felt stressed out pretty much since I got here. She immediately went into her signature victim mode, said I don't respect her, that I'm just looking for someoen to blame, and wouldn't hear a fucking word of what I had to say before she started screaming at me.

Nevermind the fact that I've done every fucking thing in my power to be helpful, worked incredibly hard to not get annoyed with how pathetic and victim-playing she is. I drive my siblings around, take them everywhere they need to go; appointments, school stuff, shopping, everything. I'm not here long, but I wanted to help, and I get zero recognition for this. 


I fucking snapped. I yelled, I ended up throwing broccoli everywhere (sort of unintentionally) and every time she yelled at me some form of her own victimhood in the situation, I kept saying fuck off, that's bullshit and I'm fucking tired of it. I went on to yell that I was sick of how constantly stressful and angry the house is, how the environment is so fucking toxic that no one is every happy for even a single fucking moment because of all the ridiculous nitpicking and pathetic victim shit that's going on. She was never like this ever before. 

I realize she is my mother, I realize how pathetic it is that a 29 year old is having a yelling match with his parents, and I know that I didn't handle it the right way, I just do not fucking care anymore.

Long as I can recall, I have been in some form of shit with this lady. I do not know what it's like to have a proud parent, and if I did, it was immediately overshadowed by some minuscule defiance that occurred weeks prior. She deploys a parenting model that I will never fucking use. I do not want my kids to ever feel this way about their family. 

This is a fuckign mess, but I'm fucking tired of her pathetic moaning and how she'll start on some task no normal person would ever think about fuckign doing at some stupid fuckign time (when everyone's eating) and start calling out how she has to do all the work around here. 

fuck off victim. Be a source of logic, intelligence, and proper ways to handle things lest this family become a bunch of pathetic victims. I don't care if this is my family, I can't associate a single fucking positive feeling with this trip, and I don't even care if I get told to fucking leave early.

",right-in-the-feels,18,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/12ypci/my_ex_boyfriend_is_getting_married_to_the_woman/,"Obviously I don't want to *stop* their wedding, and deep down at the root of it all I'd rather him be happy without me than miserable with me. I do love him in that way. I know I cannot give him what he needs and that is okay.  

I knew him since I was 13 and he was 18. His mom is one of my mom's clients (she's a divorce lawyer) and we met in the waiting room of her office. We were together from the time I was 17 til I was 19, and again from 22-24. Between 19 and 22, we were still emotionally involved, yet in an LDR so we technically were broken up yet neither of us dated anyone seriously. I'd visit him for 4 days every month while he was in California and I was home in Chicago. I moved out to be with him, but to also get away from home as I needed a change. 

It wasn't the best relationship, but it wasn't the worst either. We weren't emotionally or physically abusive. We were in love, but held on to these idealized versions of each other that we must've come up with when we were teenagers. The truth is, I am not my 13 year old self, and he is not his 18 year old self. I only wish it ended better.

I ended up moving back home after a year and a half. Los Angeles wasn't for me. I'd still visit monthly for those last 6 months. The last trip was a longer one, about 2 weeks. We went to a few events, and at all of them, this one woman who saw him around before was there. They talked, flirted, and ended up having these long deep conversations at each event, leaving me alone to mingle. The day I left, he called me upon my landing at home to end it over the phone. He couldn't even do it in person. Shortly after this, they packed up and moved to Chicago. That hurt me a lot, as he refused to do it for me but did it for her because she was sick of LA, as it was her home town. 

It's two and a half years later now. I have an awesome boyfriend who is everything my ex wasn't and beyond. It's not even a comparison. We are happy together. I didn't think I could love again, but it has only made me stronger. 

So why did I wake up sick to my stomach today? Why did I dream of them? My body physically hurts from it. I can't eat. I want them to be happy. All I could do last night was cry. It wasn't entirely about them, though, as my mom is really sick and my workplace is being sold so I don't know if I'll be out of work in the next month. I just feel like this has been a real shit week for me, and as an outsider all I can see is what my mind chooses to see. We are Facebook friends, so of course all the posts about ""OMG CONGRATS, SO EXCITED 4 WEDDING 2NITE"" from our mutual friends turn up. Even if I were to block him, I'd still be reminded of him as our lives were so intertwined. SO while I'm here dealing with my dying mother and the potential loss of income, he's out getting married to the woman who was so much better than me that she was the straw that broke the camels back. 

All of our friends are in town. Some are calling me to hang out. It hurts to much to even see them. I know why they are in town and I can't get excited about it. 

I have to leave for work now. It's my day off, but I'm gonna go into the office and make some work for myself to do so I don't sit here and wallow. Today is going to be hard. This is hurting so much that I can't even look my boyfriend in the eye. These feelings of hurt are shameful. I don't want to be with my ex. If he tried to leave her for me, or kiss me, or whatever, I'd feel disgusted. Fuck.

I have always been misanthropic. i hate people, I am very irritable. Antisocial. I only want friends so they can call to invite me out, I dont actually want to hang out with them. Everything is irritating. Layer 1.



I have not worked in 2 years. I was the BEST sales rep, by FAR. I put up SHOCKING numbers. My business closed down and my primadonna attitude got in the way at my new places of work. While my work was good, I was canned a few times. honestly, those jobs were awful and I was mirserable. I am now on unemployment going into accounting because of job security.



Heres where I break it down; I cheat through all my classes. I take them online and copy and paste. The ones I have to show up for, I ratemyprofessor my teachers and its a cakewalk. Im learning nothing. And Im becoming more antisocial. I used to really take new classes seriously to meet new people, girls etc. I could care less now. I just want to show up to class for attendance and gtfo. I havent really been meeting any new people. Although, when I am out, i am getting attention and very flirty and am well received. But i dont really want any numbers or relationshps. 5 out of 5 girlfirends turned out to be conniving whores who cheated on me/left me. Im sick of wondering if my chick is going to lose interest and fuck soemone else behind my back, its just bullshit. 



more bad stuff: i constantly steal. I steal everything. I used to justify it by saying its at certain stores who are ruining american economy. the truth is, I just dont have a lot of money on unemployment and need stuff.



I got a whore last week. And thats because I started a steroid cycle and my libido is absolutely out of control. I have slowed down on xanax, but did just snort a full one. Im actually not worried about that.



My car was stolen. My money was spent by the theives. Not that I had a whole lot. Ill get it back, but I have to figure out how to get a new one wtih zero money and a repo. and all im thinking is con/scam. 



Ive become very knowledgeable on how to do EVERYTHING that goes along with scams. I have put together the greatest scam of all time, took 8 months and i could literally tour the country making money riopping off a big corporation, would never get caught, and their insurance would cover the whole bill. victimless crime. I have many more scams. Many. I have literally figured out a way to stay on unemployment for my entire life. and I know, thats parasitic. But ya know what? this fucking world is bullshit to live through and I think if you can figure out a way to play the system that plays you like a fiddle, you deserve your reward. I honestly wouldnt mind doing somethng illegal for awhile (yes I do have the exact methods and numbers/profits in mind) and stashing the money.. going to jail for awhile and coming out and recovering it. i would not mind going to jail for awhile if it means I retire and dont have to worry about money anymore. 



I have been fighting alot lately. Not since the steroids, oddly, but before that. many fights. all my relatinoships are unleahtly. I dont like people and only do the bare minimum to keep the relatinship going. 




I look at myself and am floored.. I was perfect 2 years ago. My shit was together. i had several girlfriends, was making legitimate good money, was going strong in school etc. At some point, it was absoltuely killing me that all of that was crumbling and I think I wanted to figure out a way to be ahppy without being successful. I haev become increasingly reckless and am in a way happy about it. I dont listen to the rules. I am not weighed down by society and their opinion as to what is right and wrong. 


Problem is, i think that I am headed to jail or dying very soon the way i am going. and I like being alone, but not lonely. im good right now; getting female attention (especially since the roids) but that shtis all cyclical. No girl is going to want someone with my mindset as a long term relationsihp, although if Im in a long term relationship its only a matter of time before i get absoltely fucked over so its not really tearing me apart.

I'm a virgin, even though there have been plenty of beautiful women throughout my life who would have had sex with me.

For some reason I have my mind set that I would like to fall in love with someone, and THEN have sex with them, instead of have sex when we meet and then see if we love each other later, which is how 99% of relationships go these days it seems. Anyway, numerous times now I've met a girl who says she likes me lot and could see being in a relationship with me, only for her to go back to her ex after telling me how much she likes me non stop for a week(s). I'm usually very hopeful when I meet someone who I like (since I don't like everyone) and who likes me back, but it always seems to fall apart. 

Lately this has happened so many times that I'm starting to feel like all women are heartless liars and that I can't ever trust them again. I know this isn't true.

It was really hard and I almost dropped out, but I did get back on track, but the story still hasn’t changed.  I'm 22 now (male), in my fifth year of college, and I don't really understand what is so wrong with me...

I'm naturally an introvert, so perhaps it doesn't hit me as hard as it might some people, but it still pretty much ruins my life.  It's really disappointing...I've been so lucky in every other regard.  I have great parents who provide plenty of money for my college.  I might not be the most attractive guy but I don't think I'm ugly...although I used to when I had acne, although that seems to have mostly cleared up lately.  I'm very intelligent and breeze through high level engineering courses.  I live in a beautiful city, in a huge apartment, and have tons of free time.  I’m in the most competitive engineering program at my school and will be graduating with no debt if I stick with school.  It should be paradise, but I just can’t seem to figure out how to get it to work.

I’d like to think I’m a person who acts instead of talks, but maybe I’m just fooling myself.  I’ve been trying to fix this problem as long as I can remember, but none of the changes seem to do any good.  I’m socially awkward but I don’t think I’m THAT socially awkward.  I’ve done things like learn to look people in the eye (I realized a while back I never did this), and smile as much I can.  I try to dress alright, get frequent haircuts, and I’ve worked out for years and eat fairly healthy so I’m in decent shape.   I don’t think I’m a “nice” guy.  Those people seem to have the problems of making too many friends.  If anything I probably come across as a bit arrogant, but I really do my best to show interest in the few people I meet, and to try to find something in common.

I used to always think it would get better…especially if I could get to college; it sounded like it would be easy to make friends there.  I did my first two years in community college, and while I thought the teachers were actually great, there weren’t many opportunities to makes friends.  But I transferred to a large university around a year ago, and the story still hasn’t changed at all.  One of the unfortunate aspects of the major I chose is that I have every class with the same 50 or so kids in the same building every quarter.   These are engineering students who have mostly done their first two years together, and I have not had any luck getting to know any of them.  I’ve taken a couple general classes too though, when I could, and the story hasn’t been any different there.  Being a transfer student, I didn’t have priority on dorms, so I ended up getting an apartment by myself too.  

That old friend I lost in high school did get back in touch with me, and has invited me to a party about every other month…But it honestly just makes me feel like complete shit every time.  I hate sitting around on weekends hoping he will call and I’ll be able to do something other than sit in my apartment.  It makes me feel so helpless and pathetic.  And when he does call, it’s a small burst of hope, which is of course followed by disappointment.  
The one thing that has helped over the year has been marijuana.  I have no desire to become a stoner, or to be stoned every day, but looking forward to a weekend with some good food, a good movie, some good weed and a refuge from my problems helps keep me sane.

I know people are going to tell me to join a club or something, but I don’t think that is the solution.  I’m not a recluse voluntarily; I do not avoid social situations.  I still go to classes, do group projects and can even get in to an occasional party...but so far it’s done no good.  It actually makes me feel worse; it would be the one of the best days of my life if I could just find someone to play a game of basketball with, instead I find that in every situation I inevitably become an outcast.  I know most people don’t give a shit about me, but it really feels like the entire world hates me.

It’s not a self-esteem problem either, well maybe it is a little…I’ve very confident in my abilities as a person, and I believe I can achieve most things that I set my mind to, but I certainly have no confidence in my social abilities.  I don’t think this is unreasonable though, I’ve only associated social situations with pain.  I think this would change quickly if I had any evidence I could rely on to oppose it.  I also completely break down if anything sexual is involved, but again, I’ve had no practice here…

I really don’t have any desire to live anymore.  I’m so tired of boredom and loneliness.  It’s not enough to just be alive.  I feel like it is me against the world, and I’m tired of fighting.  

Some might point to depression or something similar, and I don’t think that is it either.  I think I certainly have the symptoms of depression, but I think they are caused by circumstance and not a chemical imbalance or something like that.   And even if it is cause by a chemical imbalance, I don’t think I could ever really be happy if it my social life is in shambles like it is.  I don’t think I have any more serious disorder like autism either, although I’ve considered it before.  I actually think, outside my social problems, I’m fairly grounded.  I have a lot of aspirations actually.  I’d like to travel, to try new food, to see a concert, to have a girlfriend, to play sports, go camping…but most of these things seem empty to do by myself (I’d certainly go traveling by myself but I don’t have the money right now).

I think I’ve pretty much come to the conclusion that I would rather not live any more years if they are going to be like the previous ones.  I’m not one to joke about things like this; I already have a plan in place.  It makes me feel better knowing that I could act on it at any time, and prevents me from using it as an excuse.  I don’t really see it as a tragedy either.  Mostly people will agree that someone with a painful illness has the right to die.  My pain may be merely emotional, but I don’t see it as being any different.

It seems so simple to fix too.  My life would probably improve greatly if I had just one close friend.  I can’t even imagine how nice it would be to have a girlfriend.  Not that I expect some girl to suddenly complete me or something, it would just be a huge weight off my shoulders.

Anyways, I don’t really know why I’m posting this; I was just bored and felt like writing it down.  I really doubt anyone can help me, but why not try right?

I really struggle with talking to people and I feel as though I am constantly being judged when in a social situation, very much so with strangers. Most of the time I am happy with my appearance, I am quite petite and have blonde hair, green eyes, but I hate my smile.

I have one female friend who tells me i'm her best friend but I feel as though she is embarrassed of me and finds me boring. Whenever we meet up it's always just the two of us and a movie. We don't hug or anything because she knows I'll act awkward. She has a descent social life, goes to a few partys. and she hugs all her other friends. We were best friends in secondary school and she had over 5 different relationships, none of which were too serious. She is stunning and outgoing.

I would love a relationship with someone who shares my interests and views, where I can act myself. Last year, a guy at my college who I thought to be pretty attractive started talking to me alot online, almost every night and quite often at college. He was very understanding of my awkwardness and became very comfortable around him. He didn't have a religion like me and we have very similar interests. Though I feel his main friends dislike me as they wont even look at me. He asked me out and I declined. I don't know why but I couldn't. I thought before that if I found someone so similar to me and I also found them attractive, then I would have no trouble starting a relationship with them but still I can’t.

I really want to be able to cuddle up and be close to someone but I can't imagine myself doing it. I am quite eager to lose my virginity too. But can't see it happening, ever. Apart from hugs from parents, I do not experience any physical contact and am beginning to feel increasingly lonely and I don't feel there is anything I can do. I also find that I talk to myself out loud alot more often. 

He's stopped talking with me online now, I really liked our conversations, they were fun and made me feel normal. He's going out with my best friend too now after I introduced them, and they meet up often. He invited her round his for a small party on a day me and her had planned to meet up and she asked me if I'd mind meeting up just the two of us another night and I said it was fine. She also said that I was also invited but at college he never told me anything though we were together most the day. (my best friend doesn't go to our college). I'm sure she asked him if I could go to and I know he'd rather I wasn't there as I guess it would be better just the two of them and his mates so I told my friend I couldn't go.

I know it sounds so selfish but part of me wishes I hadn't introduced them. It's really selfish I know, I am glad they're happy, just jealous too.
Not sure what's wrong with me but I feel pretty down most days at the moment.

TL;DR: Never been in a relationship or had a close friend due to anxiety, I’m worried I'll never be with anyone where I’d feel comfortable and not awkward. Haven't hugged anyone all this year apart from parents, not even a friend.

Allow me to explain: I spent a number of years semi-intentionally celibate. I say ""semi-intentionally"" because it started with a break-up, but after a few months I decided I preferred the single life for the time being. I still masturbated on a regular basis, and this provided all of the sexual satisfaction I needed over the course of 5 or 6 years.

Then, I had a one-night stand and everything changed. I craved sex more than ever, and over the course of about the past two years, I slept with well over a dozen guys - I lost count - some multiple times, some only once (and always protected!). I enjoyed the thrill, and would even talk to men online, exchange risqué pictures/messages, then ostensibly meet for a date (that was simply an excuse to have sex). I'm not going to lie - it was fun, it felt great, and I don't regret it. I am, however, ready for it to end.

Unfortunately, I've found that I have no clue how to communicate with men in a way that doesn't cry out ""I WANT TO FUCK YOU RIGHT NOW,"" because even though I'd like to have an actual relationship, I still want to fuck right now. I'm intelligent and witty with lots of interests, a stable job/life, and reasonably high self-confidence. How do I move out of this rut and into a place that is less sex-centric and more conducive to developing lasting relationships?

TL;DR: Spent some time sowing wild oats, now I don't know how to build a normal relationship. Discuss.

I am now 23 and married, my husband is 22. I couldn't think of a better place to post this.* **There may also be triggers about sexual abuse in this post.**

Well, here we go. I was in a really emotionally abusive and controlling relationship when I was 14. It was my first relationship and it was with a man that was 21. My parents did not know about it until the end - they ended it, but not before the damage was done. It lasted until I was 16 and he was 23.


It's hard for me to get into the details. I could probably write a novel about it. I was young, naive, stupid, insecure, and desperate to feel loved. The usual. At first, he was perfect. Kind, considerate, loving. We talked all night and all day, and I felt loved, wanted, beautiful. I was a virgin and he said he would wait as long as it took. I wanted to wait until I was out of high school to have sex and he was okay with that.

But, eventually everything went really bad. About 6 months in, he decided he couldn't wait any longer for sex and started pressuring me heavily. I still resisted, wasn't willing to bend on that. And then that is when he became emotionally abusive and controlling.

*You're stupid. You're ugly. You're fat. No one wants you. You're worthless. You're pathetic. You have no good qualities, you stupid, worthless, miserable bitch.*

I would cry. And then he would make me feel better.... kind of. 

*Looks don't matter. I don't care that you're not smart - you're still okay. You can lose weight. It doesn't matter what other people think of you, I love you.* 

Basically, he never said those negative things weren't true... just that they didn't matter to him.

It got worse from there. Looking back, I don't know how I put up with it. But what can I say. Young and dumb.

It got to the point where he started sleeping around. He told me that these women were just for sex, and it was me that he loved. He just couldn't abstain so he had to have sex with other people. And I fell for it. So, so, so stupid..

During the week, we would talk on AIM a lot. This was his opportunity to show me pictures of the women he had been sleeping with and viciously compare me to them.

*See her body? That's why I want you to work out. Her figure is so much sexier than yours.
See her eyeliner? I want you to do your makeup like that. I prefer that.
See how she wears her hair? You need to start doing your hair that way.*

I think he was just actively trying to turn me into someone else. I don't know.

At one point, he had convinced me to let him take a few pictures of my breasts. His reasoning was so that he could keep them to masturbate to, so that he wouldn't have to put so much pressure on me. AAAAAAAAAND, then emailed them to all of his buddies and showed me the emails where they were making fun of how weird/odd/ugly my breasts were. One picture even showed some stretch marks on my ribs, and they attacked that as well.

**This is the portion that may be a trigger** I had even confided in him that I had been molested when I was a child. I told him how terrible I still felt about it, etc. He eventually started using that as a weapon against me. He would just throw it in my face and be completely vile. He would tell me that I was weak for being upset about it. And that I probably enjoyed it and fantasized about it. That one mind fucked me pretty good..

He got really controlling around the time I got my first cell phone. He would call me at 3am and tell me he was killing myself, that he would get on his webcam so I could watch and gain some sort of solace. He would call during my lunch break at school. If I didn't answer, I could generally expect several voicemails just completely degrading me. Accusing me of being a whore or a slut. Sometimes they were even voicemail messages about how he was picking up razors to slit his wrists and would most likely be dead by the time I got out of school.

And I'm not even the one that ended it. I was up one night, around 4 am, bawling my eyes out. My mom had happened to be up for some reason and heard me. I told her everything. She told my dad. My dad gets his house number and calls. His mom answers and my dad says ""Your adult son has been fucking with my teenage daughter. First I'm going to come beat his ass. And then I'm going to report him as a sexual predator."" (Heh... leave it to a good ole' protective dad to be rational in these cases....)

This terrified him. My 6'5, 275lb muscular father terrified him and he skipped town. It was just let go.

Since I had turned 18, he has attempted to contact me several times. Not since I've been with my husband. Last time I heard from him was 3 months before I met my husband, which was April 2009. 

Now I live in the same town as him. I would be lying if I said that I wasn't shrouded in this stupid gut wrenching fear every time I leave the house, because there is always a fucking chance I will run into him.

The relationship fucked me up a lot. Afterwards, I went into a severe depression. I didn't trust people, especially men. Any man that gave me attention, I was mean to.

My husband changed that. Instantly loved him. Instantly felt safe. It was instantly like, ""I don't need Christ, You saved me."" The love for him, and our children, is my religion. I love him deeply. So much. He truly did save me in so many ways. I lost my  virginity to my husband, he is the father of my children.

But the problem is that every time I look in the mirror I still see stupid. fat. ugly. worthless. disgusting. stupid, stupid, stupid. fat, fat, fat, ugly, ugly, ugly. **worthless.**

And I don't know how to stop. And I know I take it out on my husband and it's not fair to him.

It's not fair to him, that intimacy sometimes makes me physically ill.

I feel like I'm married to him... but still controlled by my ex. The only other person I ever dated.

I never feel good enough. I never feel up to par. Every ounce of feeling I have towards myself is just complete hatred and I just don't know how to stop. I can't help but feel like the word ""beautiful"" or ""Sexy"" in reference to me is just a joke.

This guy fucked my head up so bad. I still feel stupid. I haven't even told my husband all of the details. I haven't told anyone all of the details. I don't know how to.


I don't know what I'm asking for. I'm just asking.

I feel SO stupid for feeling insecure. For letting it get to me. Have you heard that Eleanor Roosevelt quote, ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent""? Well, I love that quote, and find it to be 100% true. And that's why I feel stupid, really, 'cause I consent to being made feel inferior time and time again.

First, with my ex, he would make comments about big boobs, and also commented that my boobs were small right after sex (!), until one day I asked him if he preferred big boobs and he said yes, but that he loved me for me (get a clue guys, while that line is very sweet, it does nothing for the insecurity part, it simply isn't enough, always lie if necessary, you'll do less harm in such a case, it'd be just a little white lie anyway, nothing major).

Then anytime he ignored them I felt insecure. Anytime we'd watch a movie with big boobs in it, or when we'd watch porn together, I felt inferior. Then my male friends also love to talk about how hot big boobs are and sometimes make fun of small ones (and they're past their 20s, guess they'll never mature!). And my female friends and sister all have big boobs that they lvoe flaunting, and they get more attention and compliments for them, also more free drinks when we go out dancing and such.

Then there's the media of course. The constant message that small boobs are less desirable, or that at least someone ""won't mind them"" is always there. It's never like ""small breasts are really desirable BECAUSE they're small"". 

Now a woman who posts great workout videos has gone through surgery to have hers enlarged. I looked up to her 'cause she was fit, hot and rocked small breasts. And she just went under the knife... it may sound stupid, but I feel like I lost an idol. 

I also read an article the other day where guys were going on and on about how big breasts are superior and that no one likes small boobs, and those who say they do are lying, that some guys don't mind small ones, but no one actively LIKES them. That women with small breasts better have something else to compesate for that...

I have consented to feeling inferior... and it's so ingrained in my brain! Ugh! I'm so angry with myself for allowing myself to believe all these messages... they may be true, but they shouldn't be true FOR ME. And now I feel unattractive each time I look down at my breasts.

**Insights**

In summary, I was locking up my emotions and projected a strong image, because this was how I avoided negative attention and gained positive attention from my parents and my peers. Today, I am starting to accept my feelings and letting go of the strong image to be myself all the way, including love, happiness and trust, as well as doubts, weaknesses and mistakes.

Showing emotions has always been hard for me. This is rooted in parenting and how I was treated in grades 1-6 (age 7-13). Being strong and not showing emotions was my only way of avoiding negative reactions and gaining some desperately needed positive attention.

In high school and at university, I started working like a maniac for social and academic status. This gave me some validation to start with, but I slowly realized something was fishy. Working harder and harder and still feeling like I was not good enough was part of what initiated the crisis.

I can see how my parents had no clue how to meet my emotional needs as a kid. They are very loving people and always wanted the best for me, so there was no ill intent. However, knowing my grandparents, they probably didn't give my parents the best emotional confirmation either, so I honestly feel that they did their best. A split second after realizing their role in my problems, I forgave them. They might have been weak, but certainly not evil. Forgiveness can heal anything.

Locking up emotions made me dysfunctional in many areas of life. Socially, I was able to compensate very well, but I had severe trust issues. Denying my real emotions led to problems at work and made romantic love outright impossible to handle. My random break-ups, relationship freak-outs and exes that wanted me to go into therapy make perfect sense now.

I experienced the crisis as a sign that my life was falling apart. Actually, it was exactly the opposite - a new me was tearing down the walls that I had built.

Aside from r/ihaveissues, I got help from a psychotherapist (the Freudian psychoanalyst kind, not a medical doctor), a few good friends and a professional coach at work. Today, it feels like everything is mixed up into a single process, where everything helped in a different way.  I didn't try cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it may work well for someone else. Get all the help you can think of.

I used to project a very strong and successful image. This was my coping strategy - my way of gaining acceptance when I was a kid. I have started showing my feelings to friends and family. I am no longer strong in every situation, which is liberating.

My grandmother is very ill and may not survive the summer. She is very old and weak and wants to die, which is tearing me up inside. She will leave a huge hole in my heart. I allow myself to show this deep, deep sadness to others now.

I thought that I was a very analytical person, but today I would say that emotions are what matter most to me. Being analytic was a coping strategy.

Being strong also meant that I was very unforgiving towards myself. Nothing but perfection was acceptable. I am starting to accept my humanity and to forgive my own mistakes, just like I forgive everyone else. I'll even skip yoga and cleaning the apartment today.

TL;DR: I used to avoid feelings, now I accept and embrace them. **THANK YOU EVERYONE.** There is hope.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_r2cv2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/r2cv2/thank_you_healing_through_acceptance_forgiveness/,

Is there any hope for me ?",SamNotsoWise,17,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/jdc5p/29_year_old_male_virgin_never_been_with_a_woman/,"(Sorry if this seemed like a rant. I just wanted to vent it all out in one go!)

I am a 29 year old male, virgin. I have never been with another woman. I have never been kissed. I have never been in a romantic relationship. I get extremely jealous when I see other couples exhibiting PDA, kissing or cuddling. The very possibility that they might be having sex afterwards just makes me extremely mad at myself, at them and the world in general. All my friends have 'scored' and being left out is another reason why I dislike them. As a kid while growing up, my parents never said ""I love you"" or nice things to me. (Though I am sure my parents are proud of me, since I finished college, and now pursuing a masters in electronics and communication at one of the top 10 universities in the US). 

I have very few friends whom I consider close. Outside, I appear very happy and contended. I crack jokes, I hang out occasionally with them, I go to movies. But on in the inside, my loneliness is eating away my soul. I also have a slight weight problem, due to which I think I will never get a girl. When preparing for grad school, I met a girl in the tutoring center. She was the **one** girl, I truly believed I would be happy with, in my life. It was as if by sheer magic that our thoughts matched with each other. I have never been with **anyone** so compatible before. Never. 

We quickly became friends and I helped her a lot in her applications and essays. She also got great admits, as did I. One day, I gather the courage to ask her if she was single (not ask her out). She says, she is single. A little while later, she has this big crisis in life and she called me up at the middle of the night, she cried inconsolably on the phone. We talked until the sun rose that morning. My feelings for this girl were getting stronger by the day and when I finally told her about my feelings, she said she was already seeing someone, from even before we met. She said she lied to me because she was not comfortable confiding in me about her relationship status. WTF!! If she was seeing someone else, why the fuck did she call me in the middle of the night to talk to me for the whole fucking night. Where was her fucking boyfriend then ?? I felt like I was used. I almost lost my faith in the female sex that day when I was rejected by her. The last I heard about her, she was engaged to that 'other' guy and who knows they might be already married by now. I am not in touch with her (should I even be???).

So now almost 7 months later, I go to this dance class where I have met a very warm hearted, kind, sweet girl and I am dying to ask her out. Maybe she won't be as nasty as the previous girl. But I am 100000% sure she won't go out with me. She is gorgeous, I am gawky and socially awkward. She is a hurricane, I am a drizzle. Why should she, after all ?

Yes, I have been suicidal before, but not anymore (though I frankly don't know how far I can go without a relapse). 

I just want to know what's wrong with me. I am a caring, considerate, understanding person and I go out of my way to help others. I can empathize with others really well (though I might not be able to express it in the best way). Despite all of the above qualities, I seem to never make a lasting impression on anyone. People seem to like me, but no one ever loves me the way I want to be loved. For once in life, I want to be loved, to be wanted. Is that too much to ask ? 

I think no matter what one says about beauty, if you are not attractive on the outside, it does not matter. True, inner beauty is all that is left in the end while outer beauty fades, but fact is, it is outer beauty which attracts people at the first place. Without outer physical beauty, I am no one. No one would ever date me or love me. This feeling is building up inside of me ever since I can remember. Sometimes I feel if I should just pay for sex and get over with it. But then, I believe in emotional love making with the person you love the most, not in just paying money for sex. And yeah, ethnically, I am Asian Indian and chicks in the US may not prefer that, I guess.

Is there any hope for me at all ? Is there any reason to believe that one day I too would be loved by someone who won't care about my looks but only about how good I am as a person ?

We were living together, talking about marriage, and our futures together. My niece who is 6 months younger than me (18F at the time) had also always been my best friend. She had been living in another state for a few years and had recently moved home. Her and I hung out all the time, she was always coming to my boyfriend and I's apartment and staying over.


Well it turned out that for 6 months my boyfriend and my niece/best friend had been sleeping together and having a full on affair. This was obviously completely devastating information to learn. I lost my best friend / family member, and boyfriend all at once. Two people I trusted the most.


Well after all of this happened she stopped all contact with my entire family. Which I was happy about because I wanted nothing to do with her. They ended up staying together and getting married in December 2011. 


Now I 23F have been living abroad for the past 10 months. During this time my niece 22F has decided to make her move back into the family. I go home in 3 weeks and have no idea what to do about this situation. My ex 24M her now husband and I had a serious talk about a year after this all went down and are ok now. (as ok as we could be after something like this...) However, she has never once tried to contact me or apologize for her actions. 


When I return home in 3 weeks what am I supposed to do at family functions now that she is coming around?

From little things like not doing all of the dishes, to big things like forgetting to complete assignments at work.

I don't really have any friends.  The only people I see in real life are my wife's family and friends.  I will rarely (read: every year or so) see some old friends from college.

I don't have any hobbies aside from playing video games and listening to odd genres of music (though mostly video game music).  My life revolves around games for the most part.

I feel like I will one day snap and cut myself off from everyone, and just do nothing except go to work, come home, and play video games until I die.  What scares me is that I WOULD BE FINE IN THE SHORT-TERM IF THIS WAS THE CASE.  If I had the balls to just completely sever contact from everyone, I would, to satisfy that urge.  But I know that this would destroy me in the long run so I refrain from it.

Here are some examples of things I just did TODAY that call my maturity into question.

Today we got lunch with my in-laws.  When the check came, her brother and father immediately got their wallets out - I was content to hang back and let them cover it.  I wasn't called out or prompted about it until later when my wife mentioned it in private.  When my sister-in-law asked what we were doing later, I froze up and couldn't answer her, instead of giving the simple (and truthful) answer of ""Oh, we were planning to spend the night at home relaxing.""

I pretty much ruined my wife's birthday.  She just turned 30 today.  For a couple months, she's been mentioning that she doesn't feel like I'm treating her like a wife.  For her birthday, I got her... a Zelda art book.  And that's it.  Didn't follow through on anything else I had planned.  She cried her eyes out in the bathroom a couple times and I didn't even think anything was wrong until she finally called me out on it.  Even when I looked RIGHT AT HER FACE, as she left the bathroom, I thought she was okay.

Even just typing all of this out, I was tempted several times to just give up.  My body started reacting POSITIVELY to this, like ""go ahead and quit, you won't have to do this work anymore, it'll feel great!""  I don't know if this is normal.  I don't want to just blame this on a chemical imbalance and try to get on pills - I simply want to know if anyone else has experienced this feeling of ""giving up makes you feel good in a perverted, addictive way"".

And even now, thought it's still my wife's birthday, it's all I can think about to try to figure out what's wrong with ME right now, because if I don't, she will probably leave me.

I understand this probably isn't much to work with, I really want to just start a discussion right now because I have a lot of problems and I want to fix them and be a functional adult for once in my life.  I'll gladly answer any questions.  Thank you.

I know that makes me look like an asshole. Maybe I am. I really try hard not to be, though. I'm not apathetic. Toward the end of these relationships--when I started falling out of love--I still care about my SOs dearly. I'm just not in love with them anymore. I know the ""spark"" doesn't last forever, but spending time with them at all starts to feel like a chore. On the surface, nothing is really wrong with the relationship. I might even be able to list dozens of things I like about them. But it doesn't seem to help.

Looking at that line graph, objectively, I feel like the ""Her"" line great is the more healthy one. I mean, it makes sense. Why get enthralled with someone you've only just met? Shouldn't love be something that is built over time? The beginning of the relationship--the courting/chasing period--gives me so many butterflies. It consumes my every waking thought. But once I get comfortable and she starts showering me with endless affection, I get bored. Yeah, I know. I'm an asshole. But I really don't want to be. I just want them to be happy, and it sickens me that I can't find it within me to keep it going.

I'm currently in a relationship that's on a ""downward trend"" for my interest. I don't know if it's possible to save at this point. I don't want to lead her on. So, should I just break up with her? Or should I figure out what the hell is wrong with my head so that I can keep it going, and try to have a lasting relationship with someone who might actually be pretty good for me?

Just a little background, I don't jump from relationship to relationship. I actually have a pretty long buffer time between girlfriends. The last time I was single (a period that lasted over a year) I made a list of things I was looking for a girl with the hopes that it would lead my next relationship to be healthier and longer lasting. I'd say my current girlfriend meets most of that criteria. We get along great -- good conversations, sex. I told her that I need space in a relationship, and she doesn't mind that. She needs some space, too. We spend the night together only 2-3 times a week. But even that's starting to feel like too much. But back when we first started dating... hell, I would have seen her every day of the week if I could.

The issue is that I have zero relationship experience.  I have a few first dates under my belt and once at a party a girl sat on my lap.  I haven't even been kissed.  

It is awkward since all three of my roommates have girlfriends and I made up a lie about how my summer fling ended.  (Kinda true I went on a date with a girl over the summer and tried numerous times over the summer for a 2nd date to no avail. ) 

Well the sex conversation came up and I had nothing to add, just nodded my head and pretended that I ""been there, done that"".  

I was once honest about my virginity when it was revealed through a game of ""never-have-I-ever"".  When I went outside to smoke a cigarette (now a nonsmoker) I could hear one of the girls in my social group cackling with laughter and talking to someone on her cellphone and I heard her say my name.  I filled in the blanks about what the conversation was about.  

Fast forward to last weekend.  I went bar hopping with some of my new found friends.  Among them was a girl who was into me.  We had talked and hung out previously and while I found her attractive, I felt like there was next to zero relationship potential.  

Well she ended up back at my dorm room that night.  She layed down on my bed and I did something stupid.  I sat down and turned on the TV.  Within a few minutes she is saying she is tired, puts her heels back on and gives me a hug goodbye.  

Deep down I felt like I did this because I wanted to lose my virginity to someone I was in love with, which feels so sappy and girly.  I also feel like I didn't know how to initiate foreplay and sex.  I have not even kissed a girl before.  

Even still, I can't help beating myself up over whether I made the right decision.  I feel if I lost my virginity the whole pressure of it would subside and I can go on with my life.

My partner died some five years ago, cancer, it was slow and unpleasant.  She asked me to look after her mother, which I did.  However she died about a year ago.  I gave up work to look after my partner and I haven't worked since, I had lots of money so I didn't need to, and I didn't want to.

After her mum died there was a sense of relief that I was free from the sense of responsibility, but I also became extremely angry.  Sudden rages would come from nowhere, it was quite scary at times.  During all that time I haven't really dated.  I haven't had sex, or even kissed anyone, for more than five years.  I suspect this is part of my anger.

We moved to where she was born when she found out she was terminal and I'm still there, and there seems to be nobody for me here.  Or perhaps I just don't meet them.  I'm fairly attractive, I never used to have much trouble getting dates.  I work now, I look after myself, I eat well, exercise, don't drink much.  I used to socialise a lot more, but since I got angry I can't spend time around people.

The thing is, I have spent the last five years dealing with grief, its been hard.  Nobody wanted to support me in all that time, nobody cared enough, and yet I see couples all around me.  So it's seems to me that I'm not going to meet anybody else.  Despite all the good things about me, whatever qualifies people to be in a couple, I don't have that now.  I will never feel intimacy or physical affection again.

But I don't want to be this way.  I don't like it, its hard work and I don't think its helping me.  I do want a relationship and affection, I think I deserve that as much as anyone.

I've always lurked r/relationships and admired the help you all give each other. I'm hoping you can help me this time.
Since the age of 15, sophomore year of high school, I've never been single. One long term relationship, I get bored, I end it (with much difficulty). Rinse and repeat. The longest period I've had of singleness dates about 2 weeks. I feel pathetic when I think about it, but the truth is: I try. I really try. I finally break up with a guy who I've been leading on for years...then cue all these men gunning for me...combined with my deep-rooted psychological need for attention and assurance, as well as my complete and total lack of experience in how to live without an SO, I end up with one of them. Right away. It's horrible.
I seriously have NEVER lived alone, been alone, been without someone who loves me that I can call when I'm in deep need, to be there for me, pick me up when I need, understand me, let me cry, etc. Seems like what everyone would ever want, right? And all of these guys were incredible, amazing people. Every single one of them, outstanding boyfriends. If love was a mathematical equation, I'd say I got it right each time. Alas, I have always had to play the ""bad person"" card and end each of these relationships. Often with overlap with the next person. Often months and months after I began really wishing it was over. The amount of times I've dragged these amazing guys along...:(
So yes, I know, that all sounded horrible. But I seriously want to change this. I want to — nay — I NEED to understand the importance of being independent (I am without a doubt one of the most dependent people on this planet). I want to know how to go home, alone, and be content. With who I am, without the context of a man. It's sad yet important to mention that with all of my boyfriends (I've, at this point, gone through about 6 of them incredibly seriously — the whole ""I'm gonna marry him"" deal. Each and every time. Ugh) I've more or less ""molded"" to the kind of person that would be ideal for them. I mean, honestly, my personality CHANGED. Every time, in accordance to each guy. I'm going to make up names here for sake of anonymity, and pretend my name is Liz: For 3 years, I was 'John's Liz.' Next 2 years: 'Ben's Liz.' Next 6 months: 'Frank's Liz'. 9 months, 1 year, 1 year. I've literally molded to all of these people. It's fucking insanity. I have absolutely NO IDEA what kind of person I would be if I had been single all this time. I have no idea who I am, independent of a boyfriend.
I've always been that girl with a boyfriend. That girl who gets invited places by friends (potential great friends) but doesn't want to go because she'd rather spend another night doing the same old-same old with my boyfriend. I've been ridiculed (in a mostly joking manner) by my family...they've turned predicting my love life and relationship status into a running joke/game they play. ""How long will XXX last before she dumps him and brings home the next one!? LOL!"" They've decided that ""Maneater"" is my theme song and sing it to me almost every time we're together. Even in front of my boyfriends. Needless to say, I don't like that.
I can talk about how much all of the above is a problem for me forever, really. If the point hasn't been communicated yet, I'm willing to elaborate — just ask.
ANYWAYS. Fast forward to now: here I am. I was in a serious relationship (about 1 year), I graduated. Got a full time job in a new city. Moved here, alone. I knew NOBODY. I'm an ""official"" member of ""real life."" It was very hard for me to come home to nobody, and fall asleep alone every night. (I have a serious dependency on the presence of someone in my bed at night to sleep next to --- sleeping alone scares the shit out of me.) The long distance relationship: skyping, texting, you know the drill — just wasn't cutting it. A few months into being here by myself, I met a new guy through friends at work. We are still dating. It's been about 11 months. He's extremely good to me, protects me, loves me unconditionally, and has stuck by my side through EXTREME amounts of shit. Plus he makes me laugh.
I should mention that I'm a serious hopeless romantic. I'm one of those sappy ass fellas who believes that an honest-to-zeus fairy tale of love is out there waiting for me. Soul mates and shit. I'm still waiting for it, and needless to say - I haven't found it. I've been in very confident, ""this will last forever"" love a handful of times, but it never lasts. And now this current relationship. I don't see it lasting into the long distance future, in otherwords: I'm positive I won't marry him. I feel in my gut that I shouldn't be with him, that I'm hurting him. That I'm on the precipice of disaster to his heart. That he'll end up going like all the rest of the guys in my life. The ones I break up with every damn time with the same ass ""excuse:"" (it's honestly not an excuse) ""I need to develop the ability to be independent, I've never been single, I don't know who I am.""
So I feel like all that was really long. I'm sorry. I need you reddit. To first not think I'm some evil man-eating creature with an insatiable lust for hearts. But mostly, WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK DO I DO?!? I'm hoping I can get some reassurance that breaking up is the right thing to do...and also...how do I even go about doing that? (I'm always a giant pussy who just sits on a relationship way past when I should because I'm too damn scared to break someones heart.) And if and after I do, how the serious fuck does one go about being independent? How can I stop myself from just falling for the next guy trying to get in my pants? How can I find myself??
TL;DR: From one long term relationship to the next, I've never been single...I don't know who I am, I don't know how to break up with guys I don't like, I feel like I'm lost as a person without a boyfriend but don't want to be!

I'm generally a pretty socially aware guy and have no problem making friends, but there's always been something that really freaks me out and puts me into crazy-mode automatically and I always have to hide it.

If I'm talking to a close friend and they joke about not liking me or leaving me out of something, even if they're just teasing me in a friendly way, or if they start ignoring me, I get really scared. I logically know that we're good friends and they're joking, but something inside me gets really, really scared and it makes me want to cry. I don't cry hardly ever, not that I'm afraid to, I just don't. I'm 18 and male.

I think I have a really severe fear of losing attachment with close friends and I don't know how to deal with it. It's like, when people joke like this when we're having fun all day, it feels in my mind like ""woah, that went too far"" but it really doesn't seem that way to anyone else.

My girlfriend does this to me sometimes without realizing it. She likes to joke when we're talking and say that she wants to find another future husband (it's obviously a joke, we both know it is) but for some reason that really fucking scares me and it makes me get really quiet and tearful but I don't show it. It's not just her that elicits this response from me.

The first time I remember feeling this phobia is when I was a toddler. I remember being left in a day care by myself without my twin brother, and my mom and my brother left without me and I had to stay at the daycare by myself. It was really scary for me. My mom and brother both say this never happened, which makes me think it was a dream. There isn't any abuse or anything in the family, so I really do think it was just a dream.

What I’m looking for with this post are people who have been or are in the same situation as I am and share ideas and thoughts. So here is my story, I’ll try to be as brief as possible.

I’ve been in a relationship for almost 9.5 years. My ex ended it about 2 years ago and she is now a happy mother and soon to be married. I feel happy for her and I’m still in contact with her. But although I don’t have a problem with my ex (or want her back or whatever) this relationship left me damaged and I think I recently realized in what way.

I’m not a very outgoing person but (as I have been told numerous times) a rather attractive guy. So in those 2 years as single I never went to a bar/club/whatever to chat up girls and when I’m around new people I’m usually rather quiet. When I get to know people I usually warm up and start talking. I have lots of friends, get invited to parties and so on, so I don’t think I’m totally socially inapt. I dated 5 girls in those 2 years. How? They chatted me up, got interested and everything, we had fun together, had sex, … and in the end I would always get “friendzoned”. All this happens in a time frame of roughly 2-3 months. And afterwards I would always be heartbroken and depressed.

Of course it could be absolutely possible that there never was a chance for a relationship, that these girls just wanted to have fun and I just didn’t get it. I was thinking about that and I think it’s not true. I don’t mean that they were looking for a relationship, either. I just think that it was something in between. I also thought about what I might have “done wrong”... and I saw a pattern. It seems that whenever I meet a girl who I feel remotely interested in my heart goes all in. I can’t stop thinking about her, I totally go out of my way to meet her, spend time with her, treat her like princess, cancel plans I had with other people, even plan my free time around the possibility(!) that she might(!) want to do something with me. Now assuming all those girls where all well adjusted people I think it’s not surprising they bailed out. Why? Because it is just too much! I think that treating someone like this puts a huge pressure on the other person to “give back”... but how can you give back so much without giving up your own live to a degree that is just unhealthy? The strange thing is, I wouldn’t want that, either. I want someone who is capable of living her own live and doesn’t depend on me to “fix her” in some way or the other. And I don’t want to be a doormat. So where does this behaviour come from? I think living in a relationship for 9.5 years just left me in a state where I am so used to it that in the back of my head or bottom of my heart or whatever I feel I need someone to fill the void. And whenever there is just a remote chance of that happening I just loose it and transform into a doormat, thereby ruining my chance of finding a well-adjusted, stable, confident, nice, smart girl. I guess I’m kind of lucky that all the girls I met where like that and that I didn’t meet an emotional vampire who would have loved sucking away my energy and then leaving me.

Don’t get me wrong! I don’t want to learn how to be a douche bag. I am and always will be a “nice guy”. I don’t have a problem with that and I’m not looking for the kind of girl who wants a guy who treats her like a piece of furniture. I want a confident, self-reliant, smart girl in my life. But why would a girl like that want a doormat as bf?

The thing that just drives me nuts is that whenever I am in a situation like this I seem to loose any capability of being able to judge where I should draw the line. I start thinking about everything I do, questioning everything I say or think, I just can’t act naturally anymore, I’m just not myself anymore. I have no problems of saying “no” to a friend when I don’t want to do something. I have no problems to chose what I want to do when asked by a friend. I just do what I want to do, make compromises when I want to or I really don’t care one way or the other and I never had any problems with any of my friends in any way. But whenever I am around “that special person of the time” it seems like “my self” shuts down and I have to remote control someone through a video game I don’t know the rules or goals of. Seriously, who would want to be with someone like that?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you get over it? Did it happend by the realisation alone or did you do something specific? Are you in a similar situation and disagree with what I think? Any ideas, thoughts, comments are welcome! :)

I've had this problem my whole life. I'd talk to a girl and if we connect and she seems to give off signals of interest I start crushing on her and it grows into more than just a crush. It grows into full blown limerence where I can't stop thinking about her 24/7 and I don't want to eat or sleep or do any of the things that I used to enjoy, I just want to think about her.
I work with her so trying to ask her out or something is not an option. I estimate I have like a 70% chance of rejection and her giving me the ""we're just friends"" speech and then things will be awkward and I can't avoid her.

The problem is she's so flirty and playful with me so even though I keep telling myself that that's just her personality and she acts like that towards everyone, a part of me keeps saying that she's attracted to me.
Ughh I hate it, I told myself I'd rather really hate and despise her than be totally infatuated with her so yesterday I laid in bed for 4 hours just thinking as many nasty things about her as possible and then the next day I saw her and she smiled at me and I just can't help but smile back and laugh with her and talk about things with her even though I really should be avoiding her.

This feels worse than any drug addiction. Quitting heroin cold turkey would be easier than quitting her right now. I've had this problem my whole life where I'd get limerant over a girl and the ONLY times I ever got over them was after not being in contact with them for at least a year. This isn't possible in this situation because I work with her.
How the fuck do I stop feeling this way? I want to just rip my heart out I'm so desperate to feel nothing. It feels sooo good thinking about her and then it feels sooo bad thinking she doesn't feel the same way.

I think I may have intimacy issues…",Iprobablyhaveissues1,14,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1a6k4e/im_nearly_30_m_and_have_never_had_a_serious/,"Hey Reddit; I’m depressed with life and need to unload.

I’ve dated a few girls over the years, but it’s never lasted for more then a few weeks, or a few months tops. I spent most of college crushing on this one girl, although it was fairly obvious she didn’t reciprocate. I ended college without managing to make a fool out of myself by hitting on her, but it took me a while to get over it. I went through the classic ‘white knight’ phase with regards to my understanding of relationships with women.

By this point I was still essentially a virgin. At 22 I had a brief summer romance with a girl around the same age, but she had come from a relationship with a much older man, and was a bit messed up. I was hesitant to sleep with her due to my religious beliefs, but she eventually persuaded me. Unfortunately being my first time we didn’t really get past third base, and the relationship didn’t last long enough to make many attempts at changing that. She spent a lot of it crying, and when she finally broke it off with me I found it a relief.

A few years later I’d been dating another girl for a few weeks; things seemed to be going well, but she complained about her ex a lot, and eventually revealed to me that she was on anti-depressants. I got to third base with her too, but when she called to break it off I tried to be understanding. I was less so when I met her at a friends wedding a few months later, to find her engaged to her ex. I chalked it up to experience.

I’ve known a few girls in the years since, but nothing went much beyond fooling around on the dance floor. Then I met the younger cousin of a friend while she was visiting the country, and after a night of embarrassing drunkenly hitting on every girl at the party, hit it off with her. 

Things went well; we moved from club to club, but then one of the other guys in the group, a friend of a friend, decided he wanted her instead. I warned him off several times, but I…don’t do confrontation well. Eventually I left the club rather then start a fight with him, and somehow ended up in my car trying to calm down. She found me later, and after a lot of talking, things moved to the back seat. She initiated…but somehow I couldn’t go through with it, and stopped her before the point of no return. I don’t know if it was religious conviction, or if I’d sobered up enough to realise I was about to have a one night stand with a friends relative who I didn’t have any feelings for. Regardless; I was proud of the decision at the time.

A few months ago I met a very attractive girl, and things moved very quickly. Too quickly. Second base on the first date, third base on the next. She made it clear I would stay over at hers at the next one.

…which is when I panicked. I knew we weren’t going to work out from the time we’d spent together; despite the attraction our backgrounds were way too different (e.g; Christian vs. spiritualist). I broke it off rather then risk sleeping with her (and then breaking it off after). I told myself it was the noble thing to do, but looking back I wonder if I was just terrified of having a real relationship.

So here I am; 29-and-going-on-30, living alone, spending too much time on Reddit and thinking about getting a cat. To my shame I trawled the local church to see if I might find a prospective partner, but Christians tend to marry young. I’m nearly a decade older then most of the single women there. A part of me is terrified that I’ve been left behind, that I’m broken in some way. Nearly all of my friends are married or in long-term relationships.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve given online dating a whirl, but found the pool rather shallow in my small town. A part of me wants to just book a hooker and try to overcome my issues that way. Another part of me wonders that, should I go down that route, if I’d ever be able to respect myself again.

Any advice appreciated.

I like a girl who's a little bigger, nothing wrong with that at all, but after 3 years she has gained probably 50+ lbs. I am not exactly sure of her weight (not that stupid to ask lol) but I've heard her mention she weighs as much as I do. I am 6' and 225 no looker by any means but im average I guess. She is about 5'5 or 5'6 and I guess 225 now. When we first meet she was probably around 170ish?

My best guess is the fact she switched jobs to one where all she does is sit in a cubical and answer a phone or type up reports. Her old job atleast had her walking around most of the day. I would never ask her to go to a gym and work out since I dont. I on the other hand work a physical job. I am constantly required to move 25+ lb boxes about 70% of the day and am on my feet 100% of the day. A year and a half ago we did buy a house (well I bought a house) and move in together but I dont feel that should have caused that to change?

I cannot for the life of me think of a way to tell her the real reason we havent had sex in about 6 months. It would crush her if I did and I love this woman too much to do that. Not having sex on the other hand is hurting both of us. She feels unwanted, I feel unsatisfied and guilty for the fact I dont find her as attractive as I used to.

One is free, independent, wild and permanently craves strong sensations; the other is loving, caring, devoted and craves closeness and intimacy.

(I'll specify now before someone misunderstands: this is not a split-personality type disorder; both aspects of my personality strictly belong to myself and I have no problems with identifying myself.)

I have found no way to satisfactorily merge them. If I'm single, I eventually start craving emotional feelings and a relationship; but if I get into one, I eventually start craving singledom and independence. This **always**, inescapably, happens, independently of what I might feel for the partner in question. It never takes very long and I only have a limited ability to resist it - I can only delay it for a while, not avoid it.

I am not, however, a bad person; I'm not OK with causing suffering to others in order to appease my variable feelings - the breakup of my one long-term relationship was the worst period of my life, and it took me two years of constant guilt over breaking the heart of my then-girlfriend before I could begin to see some light. I'm not looking forward to repeating this.

After some more trouble with other women (none anywhere close to that level) a friend of mine had an insightful comment - she said that my good-natured, caring personality gives an impression of myself that is at odds with my constant craving for independence and mindless pleasure; the result, from the point of view of anyone interested in me, is an unexpectedly lethal mix that makes me a ticking time bomb for anyone who would get sentimentally involved with me. 

Realizing that this is in fact true, I've forcibly stayed single ever since, not looking for relationships and limiting myself to sentimentally uninvolved friendships with benefits at most. I'm not happy, but at least I'm keeping my heart-breaking tendencies in check - it's better to be relatively unhappy by yourself than to have brief moments of happiness followed by devastating misery for all involved.

I'd still prefer it if I could find some way to stop this continuous emotional seesaw, either by merging everything or by finding some way of sticking to one end of my character, regardless of which it is. I'm more rational than most and this gives me a degree of control over my feelings; while this makes it easier to avoid falling for anyone I'm not sure I can keep it up forever, and I'd very much like to fix things before something happens that would cause me to break another heart.

Now I'm worried that it might be a turn-off.",MrToolguy55,15,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/w7aum/im_a_26_year_old_male_virgin_and_i_think_i_got/,"So, I don't actually know for sure that I got rejected for being a virgin, but I'm pretty sure it's one of the main reasons. The whole story is actually pretty long, so I've shortened it down to just this one side of the issue that I'm dealing with.

I was making out with a girl who I had been having a crush on for over a year. I told her I liked her, she said she liked me too, and SHE initiated it. It was my first time ever doing anything like this. She asked if I had ever slept with anyone, and I said that I hadn't. She asked why, and I said that I had never had any one night stands or anything like that (sounds like a stupid response, but it made sense because she already knew I had never dated or been in a relationship). I asked her why she was breaking up with her boyfriend, and she said it was because of me AND she wanted to see what it would be like to just be by herself (sounds messed up, doesn't it?). After talking a little more, she randomly said, “I can't believe you've never had sex...” I just said again that it was because I had never been with another woman, and she just said “okay.”

In a nutshell, we went back to being “just friends” after that, even though I noticed she was significantly less interested in our “friendship” than she was before. I asked her if she was thinking of going back to the boyfriend she was trying to break up with, and she said “I don't know, maybe...” I was petrified when she said that, but I kept my cool because I didn't want to ruin anything between us. I told her how much I liked her, and that it was going to be hard to be just friends with her. She said, “yeah, I really fucked everything up, didn't I?” 

Now I don't want people to get the impression that she's a total bitch; she's one of the sweetest most awesome girls I've ever met and would never do anything to intentionally hurt me. She's a great person and a great friend. But yes, her decision making obviously wasn't the best in this case, and now I feel hurt.

I have never been so self-conscious of my virginity until after this happened. I'm starting to realize now that pretty much everyone around me has turned in their V card at some point in time. Old people, young people, boys who are 10 years younger than me, awesome girls like her, friends within my age group, they've all most likely done it already. I always just figured I would do it with someone who I really liked and who liked me back. It took me a while to realize that, but that's basically it. So this is what “being patient” has done for me. Now the way I see it is that the older I get, the more of a curse my virginity is going to be.

I know that I probably could stand to have a little more confidence and just start asking girls out. But I don't really want to just do that in order to have sex. Or should I? I don't know, I fantasize about doing it all the time with a lot of women I see, but ideally I'd like to do it with someone I actually have feelings for. And I REALLY liked what was going on between me and this girl. There was some serious interest and attraction between us that went on for a long time. I don't really want to risk complicating things or hurting anyone by just doing it with someone who I don't have serious feelings for. But I'm 26 now, and I'm really worried that the next woman I get close to might get turned off by me being a relatively old virgin. And apparently, the first time isn't that great, so that scares me too. This all feels like something I wish I had taken care of as a teenager, so I feel really behind.

Any comments, advice, input, etc. would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

Edit: I should probably mention that this incident happened quite a while ago. It's pretty clear now that she's not interested in anything more than friendship, and we don't talk nearly as much as we used to. So I've had to accept that. I've just been mulling over this virgin thing in my head a lot since it happened. I'd like to be able to just forget about it and treat it like it's not a big deal, but I haven't been able to.

TL;DR – I think I probably got rejected for being a 26 year old virgin, and it has had a huge negative impact on my confidence and self esteem. I'm worried about what will happen next.

Instead, he started blowing off my requests to see him, and would only talk to me in very short, emotionless sentences. During this time, we only communicated through IM as he didn't have time (apparently) to see me in person. I tried to talk to him about it but he acted annoyed whenever I brought it up, so in the end, I just gave him some space. I thought he would need it, because he was busy with work. He took that space and ran with it. Didn't speak to me for two months, despite hanging out with his other friends and playing video games in his spare time. Usually, I would've been his first priority whenever free time was had. But at this stage, I didn't even register on his list. So I initiated no contact because I was tired of being hurt. He started being distant 5 months ago, and it's been 3 months since I initiated the no contact.

My problem is that he was, in my opinion, the perfect person. I didn't realize it until I met him, but he is everything I ever wanted to be. Brilliant, motivated, successful, independent...everything. Knowing him made me realize that I am none of these things, but that I must still be worth something, because he wanted to be around me. He told me that I was the most important thing to him. But then he got bored with me and let me go. If he was just a friend, I wouldn't have minded his distance. But I loved him, so it was too hard to cope with.

I can't be bothered doing anything anymore, because I know he'll be out there doing it better. He is a real up-and-comer in his field, and even professionals turn to him for advice. I will never have that kind of brain. I wish I did, but I don't. I'm so average, and I can't stand it. I try really really hard, but I just don't seem to succeed. I can't help but think that this is why he became bored of me. If this is the case, then nobody that interesting or amazing will ever love me...because I'll just bore them.

Everything I ever thought I was good at means nothing to me anymore, because I know that he can do these things better. I see no point in building up skill sets. I am not passionate about or dedicated to anything, because I don't believe I am good enough. I want to be as independent as he is. I want to be able to get by with nobody's company but my own. However, since he left, I've felt so unloved. I joined a dating site, but I've always believed that romance should happen naturally and that you shouldn't seek it out, so the dating site makes me feel cheap. Like I'm forcing myself into having somebody because I can't hack it alone. Which might be true. I've never sought out dates before, and I really don't like it. However, I keep thinking that if I don't do this, I'll never be loved again. I don't want to feel disgusted at myself for using the dating site, and I know that it shouldn't BE a reason to feel bad, but it just goes against everything I've ever thought about the natural development of a relationship. Yet still I can't stop.

I'm sorry, I've rambled, and I haven't gotten out half of what I want to say. I just want to know how to get my self-worth back. I don't want to feel second-rate to this person. He's no longer even a person in my mind. He's this concept. The manifestation of my perfect partner, as well as a perfect me. And he left. I feel that nobody will ever love me again. And that scares me. I want to be so much better than I am, but I don't know how.

**TL;DR** A mess of crap from my brain. Essentially, a person who encompassed everything I admire in somebody left me because (I assume) he became bored of me. This has crippled me, emotionally and mentally. I feel worthless and like nobody will ever love or respect me. I need to stop feeling this way but don't know how.

Backstory - I've never had many friends. When I was in elementary-high school, I made friends with guys, but not many girls. I was often teased for being a lesbian (I had short hair!!!) and ridiculed for my brains. Once I stopped being the person that they could go to for homework help or rely on to carry a study group, people decided I wasn't worth hanging around. Yes, I am shy. Perhaps awkward as well, although I think I have a good sense of humor and quick wit, as well as many interests.

I met my ex-husband at the age of 18. We married at 20. He was very, very controlling - so much so that I wasn't really allowed to leave the house without checking in every 10 minutes. He also didn't want friends. So, for 11 years while I stayed married, I had none.

Now I'm 33. Divorced, with a great bf, but he too is not the ""friend"" type, although he has no issue at all with me having friends. But... I don't think I know how to make them! Even online. It seems like if I approach someone they aren't interested, or stop replying to emails, etc after a short time. I don't currently work outside the home, so this is another obstacle (work from home).

Does anyone know how people make friends at this age?

UK.

Context: I was with a girl whom I considered to be the love of my life for three years, we'd been through a shitload together. She was raped on foreign soil and relapsed into crippling anorexia, and I helped her out of it, I drove her to her counselling meetings every week, I took her to her blood tests, I took her for meals at her favourite restaurants, and basically was a large part of making her healthy again. Her parents didn't help at all, they tried to force feed her (physically), they would shout at her if she didn't eat, they would refuse to drive her to her counselling / tests if she hadn't eaten (as if that was some form of punishment?) and I would come and do it instead. They hated me for 'undermining' them, and her direct family (mother, father, sister) now have criminal records for inciting violence, threats of violence, and threats against my family.

We broke up because she cheated on me, and I found out on my birthday. She was, initially, remorseful, but only because she'd been found out, soon after, she started dating the lad who has gone after every ex of mine for the past 3 years, even after she said she would never go for someone like that - he's shorter than her and wears make up for fucks sake!

When things were good with her and I they were fucking awesome, the sex was amazing, the laughs and smiles were unforgettable, we'd travel, we'd just go and do things on an impulse because that's who we were. But she threw that all away for cheating on me and then going out with this short, make up wearing arsehole. I even had an engagement ring, the one she'd fallen in love with. I still have it because I refuse to sell it for much less than what I paid for it. I even proposed to her, and she said 'yes' then, a few minutes later, 'not right now... ask me some other time' - which I then found out was because she was cheating on me and didn't want to have to make our relationship public (she had it set on Facebook so that only my friends and I could see that she was in a relationship with me, everyone else thought she was single).

Since her, I have had *some* attention from girls, but not much. I'm not exactly the ugliest duckling, but the attention I have got, I've shunned. I don't want a mediocre, rebound relationship, even if it has been seven months. I don't want to settle. I want that adventure again, the impulsiveness, but with the faithfulness. There was one girl I got with, drunk, a few times, she's stunningly beautiful and right up my street on the impulsiveness, and she's also really kind, but she has trust issues - like me. Like me, she was with a lad for a long time, who then cheated on her, and, like me, she finds it hard to be close to anyone. So I don't want a relationship with her because I know it'll be toxic.

But I can't help but feel really fucking lonely, like, no one really wants me. I'm 23, I have good looks, I'm a kind, fun, caring, impulsive, somewhat nuts kind-of person, I have great friends, a great family, I'm in a band that is starting to get prime time radio airplay and bigger performances, why do I feel like I'm inadequate for so many people? Or, more appropriately, why do I feel so many people are inadequate for me? I feel like I'd be toxic in a relationship simply because of having so much trust ruined, I actively stop relationships happening (granted I've had only two chances in 7 months) because I don't want to hurt someone like I was hurt, and I don't know how I'd be in a relationship, I'd probably cut and run. I don't know. I can't even be friendly with many women.

What is wrong with me?,xEndgame,13,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/qgk90/confused_about_girls_and_life_in_general_what_is/,"20/m I try to be a happy person, but I have literally no source of affection in my life. I have many friends and am popular and we have fun all the time, but when it comes down to it I don't feel like anyone really cares about me, and I know none of them would really be there for me if I needed it. At the core I know I'm an extremely angry person, but rather than taking it out on other people or hurting someone, I just bottle it all up, because there is no constructive way for me to deal with this level of darkness. I've learned in life that I cant really trust anyone, because everyone ultimately is in it for their own self interest and preservation. People have betrayed me, talked shit about me behind my back, and abandoned me my whole life. I'm hollow inside, but I don't want to be.

Because I have no current sources of affection or companionship(as has been the case throughout most of my life), I am very focused on getting a relationship. The times in my life when I have been truly happy have been when I am in relationships, and have girls I care about tell me they love me. Its what I long for, but at the same time I have been crushed and hurt countless times by all of the women I have ever been with, and all the women who have ever looked me in the eyes and told me they loved me. I don't trust myself, and every woman I am attracted to I avoid, because I know I am just setting myself up to be broken again. 

I don't open up to people because to me opening up and trying to find someone who will love me is not worth the risk of being hurt again. I have attempted suicide in the past after break ups(flying across the country and standing in the snow for 6 hours before having the first girl I ever loved break up with me after a year-long distance relationship), or just due to profound loneliness due to being unable to connect to other people fundamentally. I have gone through therapy and psychiatry, but nothing has changed. Half of the time I don't even feel like its worth it to keep living because of the utter hatred I have for humanity. The other half the time I am so happy to be alive and to share my brief existence with other people. Half of me wants to crush and murder everyone, and the other half wants the best for everyone, even for the people who may hate me.

Today the girl I have liked and been friend-zoned by for 15 years told me a story about one of her past sexual experiences, and just the thought of her being with someone other than me made me boil with rage, partly because I'm a virgin, and will likely continue to be for many years to come, if not for the rest of my life, and partly because subconsciously I probably feel that I own her. She sends me nude pictures and then tells me she isn't interested in being with me or having sex. People tell me I shouldn't care or get attached, and should just move on, but I'm not that kind of person. I'm active on Seddit (so don't think about linking me there, because I have already watched all the videos, read all the articles, and tried out these tactics in real life with great success), and am popular with girls in general. But I am too disgusted with the thought of getting close to someone for it to matter, even though that is the one thing I have ever wanted out of life.

I don't hate myself. Many people automatically go to this assumption. I love myself more than anyone else ever will. I think I'm a wonderful person with a lot of great talents, and its very easy to like me (probably because no one knows whats going on in my head). But despite all of that, there still is nothing inside of me keeping me attached to this world. If my life were to end today it wouldn't change the world in any way. 

I don't care about being rich, smart, popular, or handsome. If I had something to live for or someone to care about/to care about me I would try my hardest to have a better life, both for me and for them. 

But right now I don't care whether I succeed or fail, live or die, because what does it matter if no one loves me.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_qgk90,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/qgk90/confused_about_girls_and_life_in_general_what_is/,

While I'm happy for them, it does bum me out a bit from time to time. Especially when I really think about it, I've only been on two dates - ever - and very rarely attract guys.

My first reaction is ""Maybe I'm ugly?"" Personally, I think I'm cute, but I have been called ugly before. Once while out running, which was pretty unfair, to be honest. Average height, average weight. I work out when I can. At home, I dress comfortably, but when I go out, I dress well for the occasion. I might not dress like a trendy super model but I don't dress like a slob. I don't put on a lot of make up, if any, and jewelry. My girlfriends tell me that I look pretty or beautiful, but guys haven't. But I tend to flaunt what I've got without looking like a slut, to put it in simpler terms.

Then I think about myself. I am a nerd, a geek, a casual gamer since the NES, I love sci-fi and fantasy stories (Doctor Who and LotR... big fan), but I don't flaunt it to the heavens. I'll openly admit it but it's not like my world revolves around it. But I also like a few guy stuff like ice hockey, Top Gear (I'm slowly learning about cars), a bit of football... like I'm not fully knowledgeable about it, but if a guy is a fan of these topics, he'll undoubtedly still know more. And there there's the ""girly"" stuff, like shopping, clothing, interior decorating, crafts, etc. Finally, there's the rest of me that include, but is not limited to skiing, hiking, art, photography, naps, food, animals... so I'm a pretty well-rounded individual in terms of interests. 

I'm fairly confident in myself. Like I'll easily flaunt a bikini even though I know I don't have a perfect body or I'll readily jump at the chance to karaoke even though I know I'll make a fool out of myself. Usually, I laugh at myself when I do something ridiculous or dorky. I'm fairly goal oriented in a creative field. I'm earning a Masters, but I'm not an egghead. And I usually don't have problems talking to people. But I have been called intimidating, not sure why, but I guess it's because if I need to stand up for myself or get something done, I do it... unless if it's a situation where a guy can open this damn pickle jar quicker than I have the patience to open it! Har, har. In my defense, I'm not going to wait for someone to rescue me like some damsel in distress. Which leads me to this point: I'm not an easy girl. Although, my close friends do exhibit these traits, hooking up with randoms and whatnot. They deny it. But it's not like guys come up to me so that I can deny their drunken advances... possibly due to the fact that there's a supply of girls around me that ""put out"" usually.

And there's probably a few questions about the overwhelming number of the 2 dates I've been on... Apparently, I don't quite remember what went on with the first one because it was soooo long ago in high school. Obviously it wasn't spectacular in high school standards that I remember anything from it besides the fact that it happened. The second one was some time last year and I couldn't get an word in edgewise due to the guy being extremely talkative about himself, about movies, and about politics (that's a no-no topic with me). A bit awkward all around.

So I don't know if I should remain patient or fix something/everything... Any insight, big or small, is appreciated. Thanks!

We met about 2 years ago. Basically, this girl and I hit it off great and I was very excited because I grew up introverted so I was happy when a girl told me she liked me since it's never happened before. We got really close together at the time. But I never asked her out and she lost interest in me. But I was persistent and I kept going until one day she pointed out that ""we aren't going out and we won't be"" when a mutual friend thought we were dating. Her words. This was about 6 months ago.

I wish I could say I moved on after that but I haven't. Because I know at some point she liked me, I'm still clinging onto that in hopes that she might fall for me again even though I know in my head that it's almost a one in a million chance that she will. Everything I do is based around her, one way or another. I tried hitting the gym and all I could think of was how working out would impress her and better improve my chance of her getting interested in me again. I've had a few other girls show interest in me after this but at this point, I'm too obsessed because she is what I pretty much define my taste in woman now. Totally unfair for other girls, I know. Are you shaking your head yet? Because I am. I **hate** being in the state that I am now. 

Note: Not to sound like a creep, she was, and still is, one of my closest female companions (for better or worse). I just wanted to clarify that I'm not a stalker/creeper who kept persistent touch with a girl who didn't want anything to do with me. Our friendship is strictly platonic though, no emotional intimacy involved and obviously no sexual intimacy that you would find in a typical relationship.

I remember it clearly starting at around age 7 or so, related to a girl I was friends with.  This ""friend"", who was only a year older than me, would passive aggressively put me down, or compare us.  She was a smart, pretty, accomplished girl, and while I also had some of those traits to certain degree, I never felt I compared to her.

I don't blame her for my issues, we were only children, and I take responsibility for my state of mind.  Just a little background on how it all began.  Anyways, I've always compared myself to other girls (and now, women), since then.  

Age 12, I was envious of the girl with the long, uber-skinny bodies typical of that age, whereas I had boobs and curvy hips/thighs (not fat at all, and I'd kill for that body *now*, but then? I looked different than my peers).  Then it was the clear skin envy (me with my then-cystic acne, now at least a couple breakouts, but better than before at least).

I always seemed to want what I couldn't have. Be in the advanced dance classes? Nope, could never get quite good enough. Be advanced to pointe in ballet? Nope! Flat feet and the wrong body type. Have a boyfriend? Please! Feel like a normal teen? Yeah right. I couldn't relate to my peers, and I suspect it was partly because I was so bitter towards them.

Fast forward to today, and I'm happy that I've made some progress.  While I'm just now going back to college to finally get a ""real"" job someday, and I have no issues making friends now, I still find myself comparing.  It's summer and crazy hot outside, but I can't get myself to wear shorts, sleeveless shirts, or sandals (oh yeah, this nail fungus is totally attractive, especially since it's not gonna cure if I cover it with polish).  I wish I was in a cute sundress, and sandals, looking... Well, *normal*. 

But instead I'm continuing on my weightloss journey. I have another 20 lbs until my BMI says I'm ""normal.""  And then I presume another 15-20 on top of that to look ""good.""  I wasted 6 months (January-June) counting calories and working out, and when I didn't lose a damn thing, I went onto keto.  So far it seems to be working, but we'll see.  But I envy all those skinny, pretty girls who sit their eating their burgers, and cake, and tell me I should ""stop worrying"" about losing weight, and just moderate.  Because hey, if it works for them, why not me?

I see the pretty girls on my FB post photos of other fit girls, with captions like ""MOTIVATION"", and I'm sitting here like, ""Oh that must be nice, to need motivation to lose *maybe* 5 fucking lbs.""  Even the girls posting on reddit ""Finally got the courage to wear a two-piece, no fucks given!"" and what do I see? Beautiful, normal, healthy girls.  I just want to screams ""SHUT THE FUUUUCCCK UP!""

My wannabe go-to phrase as of late (meaning, I never actually say it out loud) is ""Must be nice."" I hear it in my head all the time.  ""*eye roll* Must be nice...."" I'm becoming bitter towards everyone, mad at the world. Logically, I know everyone has their problems.  Someone with health issues might look at me and think ""Must be nice"".  Or someone waiting at the bus stop in 100 degree heat while I drive by in my (admittedly beater) car with AC might be thinking ""Well, bully for her!""

But these internal hateful thoughts are consuming me, and I'm drowning.

I posted here many months ago, about having a really bad history with relationships. I've had two which were abusive, or borderline abusive. I always needed to be in a relationship, or I felt absolutely worthless. In some ways, I'm still battling the worthless feeling, though I've come a long way in that regard.

So, in the past few months, I've had no serious relationships. I'm taking a long time to be alone and figure myself out, and learn how to be independent. The goal is 2 years single, and right now I'm one year in. 

I think I won't really be healthy emotionally until I'm comfortable with the idea of single-ness long term- as in, the rest of my life long term.

The thing is, I'm happy and single now. I'm thinking more about when I'm 40-50-60 ish. I just feel like if I go back into dating, feeling like I need to be partnered up by a certain age, then I'll always have this weird thing tinging my thoughts and my decision making. What troubles me most about the idea of being single forever is the social stigma. Women who are single past 40 are really pitied- I've seen it. (although older single men are too, to be fair.) I don't want to be pitied. 

It's not the being alone that bothers me, because I have a really good support system, or boredom, because I've got a job I like and a passion (travelling). I just care too much about what people think. And I'm scared that will drag me back into my old habits of allowing myself to get with people who don't respect me. How do I fix that? 

TL;DR I'm on a quest for self improvement. I won't improve until I'm happy being single for the rest of my life. How do I do this? I really, really don't want to return to an abusive relationship. Thanks.

But she is really driving me bat shit crazy. Long story short, I am a 22 yr old female US citizen with immigrant parents who moved back to the motherland after 16 years in the US. I am the eldest and only girl between my siblings. 

When I graduated HS I convinced my parents to go back to college in the US. So I left 10,000 cash in hand.  I got a little culture shock (god we Americans drink so much) but it was all good. I got a car, rented an apartment, got a job, went to college, filed my own taxes. It was all good.

Then I fell in love. I fell so deeply in love with this guy who was my boss at the time. He is 36, from a different country, but oh my god I love him so much I am crazy about him and he loves me. So things got really serious between us, he proposed, I said yes. So I spend a year and half in the US and with this guy. My brother comes along and tells my parents everything (super conservative, religious parents would kill daughter over premarital sex ).

I came back to the Motherland to explain to parents what was going on and that I want to marry the love of my life and they decide otherwise...She took all my money, my passport my driver's license and locked them up in a safe and said to me your are never going to marry this man as long as I live. She thinks he just wants to marry me for ""papers""  and that he is too old for me and because he is from a different country. WTF!
Other that me loving this guy I had high academic ambitions, I wanted to become a doctor.

It has been 2 years now. I call him once in a while but he said he is sick and tired of waiting. He loves me but it can't go on like this. I feel like I am holding him up from a better life. I too am exhausted, I have done everything anyone could possibly imagine. My mother once convinced my father that I am under an evil magic love spell. He has beaten me twice for trying to run away. I have tried to flee the country twice.  

The sad part is I have never actually confronted my mother, I have never actually tried to convince her like what normal people do ""talk it out"". I HATE CONFRONTATIONS, every time I get the urge to talk to her it's like I get this lump in my throat and just end up crying alone in my room. What the fuck is wrong with me.

I feel like I am letting my life slip through my fingers. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I cry all the time, I have lost 10 lbs, I look like shit.  I think about killing myself but I don't want to. 

My brother is out there in the US living out my dream and is applying to medical school this year.

I want to live and be happy and be in love with the man I want to marry. I don't like being the fucking victim.


I love him so much. I can't stop crying when I think about him. I haven't seen him in almost 2 years. I am so tired of crying and sobbing.
I fucking hate it when she says that I don't know what is good for me. 
Why can't they just let me be? 

How can I just talk to her without crying and getting all snot and tears running down my face? Why does my mom make people feel so small?

I've never crossed the line physically but I'm starting to worry I'll never be happy in a monogamous relationship.,emotionaloverflow,15,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/14lc7u/i_23f_am_a_serial_emotional_cheater_ive_never/,"(This is my first time admitting this, even to myself, so apologies in advance if it gets long)

As I said, I have NEVER  physically cheated on a guy I was with. That has always been a very clear line for me.

But emotionally... things start to get blurry. 

I should also mention that I've recently accepted that I'm probably a serial dater too. I haven't had many boyfriends... but since I was 16 I've pretty much always had a boyfriend. There were two pretty long-term (2 and 3.5 years) relationships in there, so I don't feel too terrible. I love companionship. I would never give up my dreams for someone I was with... but I thrive when I'm in relationships. I do alright single, but when I'm single I feel like something is missing, when I'm in a relationship I feel like I am fearless... I'm happier. And I'm not entirely sure that's a bad thing. I love myself. And I love to love other people. And I love when other people love myself too. I'm not a dependent person by any means, but I am very symbiotic. **I'm okay with this.** 

Also, I'm not really a ""relationship jumper"". There was only one time when I left a relationship because I had feelings for someone else. In every other situation the next guy I dated was someone I met or became close to very shortly after...


But in every single serious relationship, at some point or another, I've gotten feelings for someone else. Sometimes just a little crush other times, full-blown ""I could potentially love this person"" feelings. The tricky part is, these feelings never diminished the feelings I had for the guy I was with. I felt like I cared about, wanted to be close to, cuddle with, etc. both of them. I have no idea how to turn it off. It really blows my mind that people can have feelings for one person and one person only.

Which brings me to my current situation. I am in a relationship with a guy I care very much about. It's long-distance at the moment but that's only temporary and I can't wait to go be with him in a few weeks. We text, talk, and have phonesexytimes. Then there's this other guy, who I met very briefly. We exchanged numbers because we had a few things in common and his roommate is a mutual friend. He is also several states away. But we text, a lot. Nothing inappropriate or sexual... just getting to know you conversation. And I really, really like him. I miss him even though I hardly know him. I want to cuddle with him and hold his hand. And I can't wait too feel my boyfriends lips. My heart picks up whenever I get a text from either one of them.

I know the ""right"" thing to do is to cut off contact with the ""other"" guy. Or break-up with my boyfriend. But I absolutely hate both of those options. It's like I wish I could be split into two people. Why is it an either-or choice?

This isn't the first time I've felt this way. And, whatever happens, I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. I feel terrible and guilty but I really can't turn it off.

Has anyone else ever felt this? What did you do? What should I do? 

(Also: Please, try to refrain from telling my I'm a terrible person unless it comes with constructive advice on how to not be that way. )

**TL;DR**: *I have lots of emotions. Often for more than one person at a time. I don't know how to shut it off.*

The simplest way I can explain my issue is that I am extremely uncomfortable female sexuality, but more specifically it's the idea of girls being with someone else, even if the girl is not a romantic interested and is just a friend or even acquaintance. Hearing about women's sexuality (especially casual sex) brings up incredibly intense emotions that can throw me into an almost clinically depressive state.

At this point, I don't think I could be at all comfortable being in a relationship with someone who has any kind of sexual history. If I'm close friends with a girl and hear about how she hooked up with someone, it might end the friendship. I even have a hard time being friends with girls who aren't single. 

Obviously this is a problem, and it's been getting steadily worse since I was about 16. Something happened this week that brought up a very extreme emotional reaction to me, when it should have been barely a though it my mind. It has gotten to the point where it is even interfering with sleep, my appetite, and just general functionality. I honestly have no idea what to do about it, and the idea of having therapy for it is actually pretty frightening because of how unpleasant these emotions are, and I feel like it would be easier to simply try and bury them.

 I have no idea what they see in me, I usually get way too drunk and just sing Meatloaf or play pong all night.  I don't see them during classes, and the few dates I've been on, I usually just point out how awkward it is and suggest we dine and dash.

Is there one?,I_fall_easily,13,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/szizm/i_fall_into_infatuation_easily_im_sure_there_are/,"Obvious throwaway account here.

I'm 26/m. Been involved in only one serious relationship for two years, from 23-25 years old. Was good at first, halfway through, my ex went through some serious insecurity issues and cheating issues with her ex. By this I mean she slept with her ex while dating me.

Tried to break up, had problems detaching due to her ""needy"" nature and the whole ""I'll kill myself if you leave me"" mentality from her.
Finally distangled myself, life couldn't be better. I've reclaimed my social life, I am working out, losing weight, soaring really high in my new job (flying a lot, handling regional level duties).

One thing bothers me though. From young, puberty, until even now, after my break up, I have always been infatuated very easily.

Meeting a new girl for a short 2-3 hours and having a good time with them easily makes me feel infatuated. I often feel ""happy"" or ""satisfied"" if I have a ""target"" girl that I like. If I don't have a ""target"" girl, I feel like something is missing in my life. I feel like there's an objective in my life when there is a ""target"" girl that I like. When I go out, at the back of my mind, I will remember that girl when I see cute things or knick knacks that she may like, little things remind me of ""her"", etc.

I am aware that this sounds very juvenile and high-school, and this is why I am using a throwaway. I'm rather ashamed of this - That it seems my mentality has never mature, and I'm ""desperate"", as some people would call it.

Now I understand the issues I am facing. Initially I thought that coming out of a break up, after a two year relationship, would have cured my ""desperate-ness"" problem, but apparently it hasn't.

I know how to fight this issue - In the case of right now, I actively do my best not to think of the girl that I like at the moment. I actively stop myself from visiting her Facebook page, I do not text or call her unless she does it first.

However, it's something that never ceases to cause me to look at myself in wonderment and a little bit of disgust.

Am I that desperate? Am I that sad?

And yet, the answer is: My self-esteem is frankly not lacking. My friends often describe me as being the life of the party, and not that I'm praising myself, but I know my strong points. I know that I am good with words, I can think on my feet. I know how to make people laugh, and I'm not afraid to compliment people, guys or girls, when appropriate.

If you trust my own judgement of myself, it is that I am self-confident (mostly), not afraid to speak up, not afraid to meet new people and have fun.

However it's what's inside, this ""easy-to-fall-into-infatuation"" thing, that disgusts me about myself.

**Now, my question is: I know the SYMPTOMS of this issue, and how to curb it. But what is the ROOT, what is the CAUSE of this issue? How do I CONTROL my heart? I would gladly take a sabbatical from dating and even romantic thoughts about girls for a year or two, if it would solve things, but I've tried that before, and it didn't work.**

(Backstory: I took a 2 year commitment to myself to stop dating, to stop all forms of romantic thoughts, basically to become a ""monk"" for two years. This meant I actively prevented all romantic thoughts, and tried my best to treat every single girl I knew as a guy.)

Note: When I say I look at myself with disgust or shame, I know a lot of people will say ""That's low self-esteem right there"". You may be right, but I'm not sure about that. Thing is, I used to suffer from low self-esteem. Now I'm successful in my career, I'm losing weight and working out, I have an active social life, and I know that several girls have expressed an interest in me.

Still possible to have a low self-esteem, I agree, but I would say that generally I feel good about myself. I know my worth. It's just that this little part of me makes me feel disgusted, in the sense that I wonder whether I have not grown up fully? Or whether I am lacking something in my life, something in my childhood that is affecting me so?

LAST NOTE: I grew up in an ordinary family, closer than most though. My family has always been close, never had anything like abusive parents, family break ups, divorce, etc. Nothing. We're all close, and still are. Never been abused when I was growing up, sexually, physically, emotionally, or anything. Been bullied a bit in school when I was younger, but it was nothing much, nowhere near getting beaten up or having my stuff stolen/broken, etc.

My ex had a lot of emotional baggage from events in his life that happened prior to us meeting that were never resolved, but I had always been a romantic/expressive/loving partner in relationships - so we clashed.

Long story short, I found myself looking back at 5 years of being with someone, in a situation where I had brought myself down to a level of emotional disconnectedness just to be able to survive in the relationship with him (lack of communication, no displays of affection, no sex life, relationship of convenience etc.), which left me feeling pretty cold by the time I decided to break it off with him. Understanding that I was half of the problem for letting it slide, I promised myself that if I ever met someone special, that I would do my darnedest to go back to being a loving and affectionate partner, and to not go down that road again.

Fast forward through my rebound phase, dating phase, short term relationship phase. I'm feeling really good about things, super confidant, ready to move forward, no drama baggage that hasn't been dealt with. I meet a wonderful man - kind, affectionate, heart of gold who I care a lot about and who I know I want to have a relationship with. I'm running into a snag though, I feel like I can't get past the emotional walls that I had built in my last relationship. It might sound kinda weird, but I feel like I've forgotten how to love someone? I'm not really sure how to get over this and be able to fully embrace whats going on with the man I'm now with.

TL;DR: Last relationship was void of connection/love/emotion, new relationship is/has possibility, but I've forgotten how to let myself be happy/love someone. How to I learn to do this again?

He is also very manipulative and cunning with his words. His biggest pride is his honesty and integrity. That as a salesman (that's his profession), he can make a sale without having to lie. He is now out out my life and I rarely speak with him.

What I have come to realize is that when I was younger, it was a survival mechanism. I learned to watch what I did, how I acted, down to the slightest movements (even breathing and eye rolling), and to watch what/how/when I spoke to avoid run ins with my dad. And at times I manipulated him or my mom to get out of trouble, being more successful as I got older. I no longer need these 'skills' for survival, but they remain. 


I also can craft a lie (or web of lies) on the spot without any planning or forethought (again, I feel this was learned for survival when growing up). My lies were flawless. Near impossible to know if it was a lie. In school I got away with so much shit because of this 'skill'. For about 5-7 years my parents and siblings never knew the truth about many many things. I grew to hate that I was a (pathological?) liar so I successfully cold turkey'd it. I eventually came clean to my parents and siblings, and they were shocked to find out what were truths and what were lies. Now, if there's something shady going on I will be the first to come clean, even if it makes me the jerk. I'd rather know that I was truthful. On rare times when I am confronted I always have a flash of believable lies/stories that will get me in the clear, but I have to push them aside to tell the truth.


I think that from acting/talking my way out of trouble with my parents is how I subconsciously began employing these tactics in everyday life. All day, every day I find myself taking advantage of other people using all three types of persuasion (logos, ethos, and pathos). I don't actively plan out what I will say to get what I want, it just happens. Many times I am half aware of what I'm doing, and just go with it, with the thought of ""if you cant beat 'em, the join 'em"" mentality. Sometimes I am able to catch myself crafting my every word and movement to get what I want, and I feel gross and helpless and go into depression and lock myself away. 

So, now that that is said, these 'skills' are natural to me; they come second nature. All that I do and say are calculated for some sort of gain. My friends are always blown away at how I can almost always get what I want. They ask me how I do it, and I tell them that all they have to do is ask. What my friends don't realize is that there's more. I can't explain it. I just do it. And my friends don't realize that I do it to them. I try not to, but it happens.

**The next part is the purpose behind my post, and why I'm seeking your advice/help:**

A few months ago I lost the love of my life because I made the terrible choice of choosing to lie rather than tell the truth (this was the first time since I cold turkey'd it). It was a harmless happening where I wouldn't have been in the dog house or anything for giving her the truth. I was tired, and without me thinking, the web of lies came out of my mouth. After I lied, I figured 'there was nothing to hide so I'll just stick with this story because at the core it doesn't matter'. Of course I felt like shit and I came clean a few days later. Her position was why lie over something so insignificant, there must be something more that you're not telling me. I have to agree that she maked sense. Anyways, thats when our relationship made a turn for the worse. A month later we broke up and I found myself (mostly unconsciously, sometimes consciously) manipulating, controlling, and plotting to win her back. I even found myself triggering tears at opportune moments. When to blow my nose. When to stop talking for delayed silence (phone or in person). What questions to ask, and how to word them, when to ask for a hug, when to give a hug. When to overload her with thoughts and emotions. And when to leave her with subtly loaded questions to think about. etc... Of course, she knows me, and she eventually realized what I was doing. She knows about my shit childhood, knows that I hate when I do it. I try so hard to not manipulate, but I still do it. I am a shithole. I feel like I don't deserve to be a part of every day society.



**TL;DR**

* I learned to craft master lies, and manipulate for survival (abuse home).

* I now manipulate/control everyone to get what I want.

* I lost the love of my life because of it.

* Losing her, I realized that I have bigger issues than I once thought.

In fact, I am currently the only person over the age of nine in my very large family that does not have some type of significant other.  Why?

I'm sure that this is some kind of reflection upon me, but I cannot subjectively look at my situation and discern what's wrong with me.  I'm 26, and currently pursuing my undergrad in biology, with every intention of attending med school.  Previously I was a chef, for six years, but I was laid off and during the jobless time, I decided that cooking on a professional level doesn't make me happy.  I am currently living at home (auuugh, I know), but my room is basically the size of an efficiency, and separate from the rest of the house.  I cook, I am intelligent, I am well laid back, I like to game, I'm not ugly (just maybe a little fat, which I am working on), and I have goals in life.  

Okay, enough background.  

I have a small circle of men that flit in and out of my life, for whom I am essentially 'any port in a storm'.  Their main relationships fail or falter, and they come to me.  I get reattached, and as soon as I do they have found some other girl that they're moving in with, tooootally in love with, what have you.  I am second best!

Also, for some reason, men do not approach me.  I don't know if I am intimidating, or just unappealing, but in new relationships I am -always- the one pursuing.

Before I start, maybe I'll let you know about myself a bit... I'm 18F, currently attending University. I am pursuing a career in Engineering. I have a boyfriend (of 3 years and we are both each other's first). I come from a traditional (Sri Lankan) family of 4 (mom, dad, little sister and I) and we are your average joe, middle class folks, nothing special. I'm 5'2"" and 125lbs (so my weight is average). My family immigrated from Sri Lanka when I was 5 years old and I did all of my schooling in North America. When I was little, I was enthusiastic and playful, I looked ""normal"" and everyone was my friend. However, by first grade, I started to gain weight and by 2nd grade, I was the ""fatty"" of my school. Yes, school. No one played with me anymore, I had little or ""temporary"" friends (ones who only stuck with me for homework). I was bright throughout it all though, got good grades, mostly because my parents wouldn't settle for anything else (they are very strict). I was the ""fatty"" for many years until about the end of 5th grade when my mom finally saw that the bullying I had experienced because of my weight had finally gotten to me. I did cry often those years, but my mom always tried to keep me strong and told me that everyone else was just jealous of how smart/talented I was and that I shouldn't let people's jokes bring me down. I guess after 4 years, I just couldn't do it anymore. My grades dipped a bit. I got my first B in Math (sorry if that sounds stuck up... it's just that my family prides itself on being good at math and I had always exceeded my teachers' expectations in that subject) and that's when my mom finally decided to take some drastic steps. She took me to a dietitian who told me that I was very much overweight and so, with her help and my mom's motivation, I worked really hard that summer to burn off as many pounds as I could and I did just that. When I came back to school for 6th grade, I made heads turn. No one could believe it was me. Girls started talking to me, *asking* me to come over to their houses and parties. *BOYS* started talking to me, called me by my first name (as opposed to ""hey fatass""); I even got asked out a few times. My mom told me that this kind of thing would happen and that I should politely decline. She said it was because these kinds of people only ""like"" me because I look/act in a certain way; they aren't ""true friends"". So I did, I minded my own business, stuck to the 1 or 2 friend(s) I had and picked up my schoolwork and was ok again. I moved after 6th grade, and went to a new elementary school. Once again, it was an unusual experience for me because at the new school, people actually talked to me and treated me with respect... I don't think I was quite used to it but I tried to fit in best I could and things were alright still. After 7th grade, I was accepted into a ""higher learning"" program at a secondary school in a different part of town and so we moved once again. In that program, I met a number of people who I felt shared my interests and goals and so I made some really good friends who I still have to date. I graduated from high school with these friends and was accepting into Engineering at my university of choice right away. My parents were so proud and so was I. Around that time, I met my current boyfriend, too. So I guess you could say that life was good.

After starting university, my weight fluctuated. Sometime I'd look a bit chubby and some days I'd look slim. It was ok with me though because it never went back to how bad it was in elementary school; I promised myself that I would never let that happen to me again. As for ""looks""... I never really cared about it. I care now a bit, mostly because of my boyfriend, but I don't do as much ""personal care"" as I probably should be doing. I'm pretty darn average... there is literally nothing extraordinary about me.

Anyways, right now, my main problem is that I feel ""out of place"". My highschool friends are all scattered and busy with their own lives; none of them did Engineering so I'm on my own here. I have my boyfriend though, in Engineering with me, so it's not too bad I guess. About him though... we used to be like two peas in a pod. Now, I can't even imagine what he saw in me that made him think that we were ""alike"" ... in fact, I don't think that he even thinks so anymore. After almost two years of feeling like a misfit, I'm asking for help now. I want to be normal. My boyfriend prides himself on being a ""normal guy"" so I want to be a ""normal girl"" because I think thats what he wants me to be. I think that's what everyone wants me to be if I'm going to form any kind of relationship with them (i.e. friendships). My problems are these though, to name a few:

* I don't laugh at sexual jokes as much as my boyfriend does/normal people do (like on reddit)
* I don't like porn (never seen it, I was a very sheltered child growing up, still kind of am), I don't fap (or schlick, in my case...) *but* I do fantasize about doing romantic things with my bf (and I *do* enjoy it when we do things like that irl)
* I like video games (and my boyfriend does too, this was one of the main reasons he even talked to me) *but* I recently stopped playing them because 1) they were making me stressed out and 2) I wasn't concentrating on school too well / I was wasting precious study time playing games, yielding in poor grades (which I hope now not to ever get again)
* I don't find ""normal"" movies funny (like ""Get Him To The Greek"" and other stuff)
* I don't ""check other guys out"" or even acknowledge their existence
* I don't talk to many guys, period.
* I feel like I am the definition of a SAP (Socially Awkward Penguin... see [/r/AdviceAnimals](/r/AdviceAnimals) )
* I feel like I am also a Paranoid Parrot ( see [/r/AdviceAnimals](/r/AdviceAnimals)  again)
* I don't have the money for designer clothing/makeup 
* I am not very ""girly""... to this day, I still can't teach myself to braid my hair (I wonder how I am even in Engineering because of it...) 
* I'm not fashionable/pretty (I'm serious, not insecure; I am literally nothing special)
* I am not allowed to have social networking (my parents feel that it is bad for me, and I have to respect them so yea) *but* I do keep Facebook and email(s) secretly to avoid the awkwardness of ""uhh I don't have an email but you can use this: /gives my mom's email""
* I am a great believer in God but everyone I know seems to think that it's a stupid thing to do so I keep quiet and try to assimilate (but I usually fail because I just can't talk poorly of my religion... I have too much respect for it)
* I am a great believer in my culture/traditions but again, I feel attacked whenever I try to speak about it so I keep quiet and pretend like I'm not
* I don't believe in modern relationship views (like being 100% independent) but my boyfriends seems to want this from me very much so I try (but often fail because of how happy I get when I act like my true self)
* I'm ""derpy"" and my boyfriend finds me embarrassing 90% of the time after we started seeing each other in real life (we were in a long distance relationship for 1 year; at the moment, we have been together for 2 years in real life) and I try to fix myself for him but it's hard when I'm naturally retarded and kind of like being that way... 
* I'm socially stupid and I'm constantly wishing that I was able to fit in, ideally to the point where I can have a good conversation with a totally random stranger on the bus for about an hour... my boyfriend says that he isn't social but he just did that and I was there too, trying to figure out something I could add to the conversation (but inevitably ended up just laughing a bit and smiling like a retard for 90% of the conversation)
* I'm not funny (or at least, the things I find funny, no one else really does... and similarly, the things that everyone else finds funny (including my bf), I usually don't find funny but I don't want to be a bad sport so I fake it and laugh along anyway)

Just... things like that. I want to be normal. I want my boyfriend to not be embarrassed by me. I want to be approachable, not a freak. I want to be accepted, by my boyfriend, if no one else because he's the one I love the most, no matter how many bad things happen to me while I'm with him... 

Do you have any advice on how I can be (or at least, *appear to be*) a normal person? I'm sick of being a loser who, when she finally does speak up, gets told that she's embarrassing, annoying or weird in some way when she didn't mean to be any of those things at all. I apologize so much to my boyfriend, too. I feel that I have to. I even make a list of ""things that are ok to do"" and ""things that are not ok to do"" so I can remember (these are all based on experiences I've had; they are things my boyfriend likes/dislikes about me and the way I behave). 

Please, please, please don't tell me to ""just be myself,"" Reddit. I am sick of being me. I hate me. Everyone hates me and you know what, I DON'T BLAME THEM. My boyfriend's made it clear to me how much of a loser I am and I am just grateful that he is still with me. I just want to, at least, make his life a little better by being a normal girl/girlfriend/person to him. I just don't know how. Even a few insights... maybe ones related to the points above (and how to fix those problems) would be so very much appreciated. I just want to be accepted by the one I love the most, at least. I don't want to be an outcast anymore. I want my boyfriend to appreciate me, not take my behavior as embarrassing/annoying/retarded...

This is frustrating. Obviously there is nothing wrong with the world, but something wrong with me. I reach out, and I am rejected. When I talk to someone on Facebook, eventually they stop responding. When I try to converse with people in class, it doesn’t go anywhere. In real life you just can’t ignore people, so that doesn’t happen to me, but I can see they don’t want to keep talking, so I stop.

What drives me crazy is that I am not a repugnant person. Strangers have no problem talking or trusting me, and they usually smile. Every relationship seems to get off to a good start, but it always seems to fizzle after about a day or two.

I almost succeeded a few times in the last few years, but both also fizzled out by a few months  The first time, it seemed like we were on our way to being friends, but we had nothing in common. The second, we were definitely on our way to being friends, but we had nothing in common.

When I get along with people, I tend to have nothing in common with them. When I have something in common with someone, I tend to not get along with them. Mind you, I don’t have any enemies. No one seems to HATE me, they just don’t have any affection for me.

But adolescence was awful! Sure, they let me go out, they let me drink sometimes, even smoke... but I had strict curfews, they never let me go camping with my friends on summer, and in general had a more restrictive adolescence compared to my friends.

Anyway, I went to college in our town. They hardly forbid me from doing things, but instead they used guilt to steer me off some stuff. They frowned upon many things I wanted to do, effectively discouraging me from doing them. They used the whole ""as long as you live under my roof"" speech.

I brushed it off and said that I chose the major that worked for me (My family is AG based, so I figured I would go into the family business). Since that day, he has been insulting me.

He said ""You only have a box of mini wheats on your shelf Ben "". I didn't pay attention until I heard my name at the end of the sentence. I then asked him to repeat what he said. Then proceeded to tell me that I am ""so fucking deaf"". He went into his room and I asked him why he's being this way for the past month. I was extremely angry because I have been building up my anger over the past 4 weeks. I told him that he's been a fucking douche and I've had it with his bullshit. He said that I am ""bipolar as fuck"" and told me to get out of his room. Ironically, I went into my room and just cried (I have never changed emotions as quickly as I did today). I have been in my room questioning if I should try to repair the relationship or just cut all ties.

He has lotion to put on it but he just doesn't. He also doesn't shower as much as he should, and he just doesn't give a shit about his appearance (some days he wears his Dad's hand-me-downs!)

Hi. First, a little background.

I'm a 21-year-old heterosexual male currently working through college and being quite successful at it. By and large, I have been very lucky for my entire life: Born into an upper-middle class family, no parent or sibling issues then or now, dealt with a bout of depression in late high-school (~ age 17) but not really anything beyond typical teenage angst. I consider myself a good communicator, a good speaker, and a smart guy and, depending on my mood and the state of my acne, I'd put myself in the top 50-30% on physical attractiveness. My third year of college is now winding down and it looks like I'll maintain my 3.9 GPA without much of a sweat. I have frequently been very happy because I'm an introvert and so can entertain myself. But other times I’m not so happy. 

Part of my hesitation from asking for help or advice with the problems I'm about to lay out is that I really feel like I shouldn't complain-- like all my problems are ""first world problems"" and that I ought to suck it up and count my blessings. I know what I ought to do and I know I can do it, yet at the same time I really feel lost and trapped in a situation beyond my control.

Now on to the meat of the matter. 

I am a creature of habit. And I have been for years. A lot of people talk about college as a time of transition and social learning. While I have changed a lot in some ways in my 3 years at university, I really don’t feel like I’ve changed much at all socially. I’m still kind of a child. I make friends by proximity and luck and rather than on purpose. While I have friends, I have no close friends - no one I would call up on a Friday night and say “watchya doing?” and no one in which I would confide the sort of things I’m saying here. I was thinking the other day, “Who is my best friend?” Although I could easily think of a few candidates, they were really just really good acquaintances or “playmates” (in the nonsexual, 6-year-old child sense of the word). Then I had sort of a revelation: I am no one’s best friend. I don’t think anyone would count me as their number one friend and I might be lucky to even make the top three.  

Hold that thought. We’ll come back to it. 

In related news, I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve never kissed a girl let alone anything…. else. I am good enough at reading social behavior that I know I’ve been pursued by a couple of girls before, but they all fell short of my attractiveness standards (and, in an attempt to avoid sounding shallow, most of them had other incompatibility issues keeping me from returning their affection). I really think I’m pretty good at handling social situations as they come at me, but not very good at the proactive part-- that is, getting the ball rolling. 

This ties in to my situation with my non-romantic relationships. I have this bizarre since of propriety -the same sense that keeps me from asking for help- that tells me the most polite and proper thing to do is maintain the status quo, not to burden others with my feelings, and be as non-offensive as possible. This is not to say I’m a pushover. I make a clear distinction between being non-offensive and being submissive; I love to argue and will hop on an opportunity for a friendly debate whenever I get the chance. 

The respectful distance I maintain with other people has served me excellently in my academic career, and I imagine it will do me well in the work world too, but it results in a very predictable very routine lifestyle. I also suspect that it makes it very hard for other people to read my feelings for them. Suppose that pretty girl who asked me a question about the homework was trying to signal interest. How would she know I’m interested too if the only conversation I have with her is polite but emotionless? Suppose my good friend would like to share his troubles with me, but I have never shown any strong emotion towards him. Why should he open up first? 

So, here I am. Stuck in a rut feeling unable to make deep connections with people. For any sort of long-term romantic relationship, I’m going to need to bridge that gap. I’d settle for a short term fling. Honestly, I’d really like to have a “friend with benefits.” I think that’d be fantastic because I don’t really need other people to feel fulfilled. But I know that that deeper connection must feel great. I know what it’s like to be loved and to love someone else (My parents). It is really great. But I haven’t felt that feeling in a long time. 

I sort of expect people to say “She asked you about homework? Just ask her out!” I don’t even know what “ask out” really means. I mean, I’ve seen movies where the 9-out-of-10-hot-guy says “Hey, we should catch lunch sometime. I know a place…” But I don’t know a place, I’m not 9-out-of-10, and the person I’m talking to isn’t batting her eyelashes and tugging her hair obviously interested. 


**TL;DR: I feel like it's inappropriate to express emotion, to complain, or to step in to another person's life without permission. This makes it hard for me to pursue deeper friendships and romantic relationships.**",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_1cr02a,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1cr02a/21_m_failure_to_launch_i_feel_like_im_stuck/,

How might I fix this?,Red_Gyarados,14,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1ckgzb/24m_i_can_no_longer_ignore_the_fact_that_ive/,"I've been in a long-distance relationship with my current girlfriend since November. We get to see each other once or twice a month, but we mitigate this by hanging out on Skype most nights. I value her presence in my life and genuinely look forward to having her closer. The current plan is for her to move to my town in December; she'll have her own place, but we hope to live together next year.

But there's the other girl, my coworker. When I first met her I was absolutely *floored* by her attitude and personality - I knew almost from the beginning that we had some serious chemistry and I endeavored to date her. We have so much fun together at work that I can (and often do) imagine what we might be capable of as a couple.

But before I could make a move, my girlfriend intercepted me and more or less swept me off my feet... and yet those feelings I had for my coworker did not fade, but in fact grew in intensity.

Now I feel as if I can't stand to lose either one of them. My coworker's last days are at the end of May, and my heart is reeling with each day that passes. I can't make a move while I'm committed to my girlfriend, but so much of me feels like I can't *not* make a move.

Please tell me you've been where I am, and that you worked things out somehow. I'm out of ideas.

1366046654.0,11,self.ihaveissues,1cef1g,[29/m] I'm developing an irrational fear of death that is slowly effecting my ability to function,EtTuPizza,13,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1cef1g/29m_im_developing_an_irrational_fear_of_death/,"Using a throwaway here.  I'm a 29 year old male.  I have a significant other that I'm in a good relationship with and I have a good job that I enjoy, but that can be stressful.  As part of my job, I often have to deal with people (or their families) that have been seriously injured or killed.  Typically, the injuries and deaths are rather violent in nature, although this can vary.

In the past three weeks or so, I've started thinking a lot about my own death.  Not planning it or anything, but being extremely fearful of it happening unexpectedly.  For example, before I get in my car to drive somewhere, I have to have a mental conversation where I convince myself that I'm not going to get into an accident that will kill or paralyze me.  Lately, if I get on an elevator, I become extremely fearful that it will fall with me inside and kill me, but I internalize this feeling and I doubt anyone else on the elevator could tell by looking at me that I'm silently panicking.  However, if I find myself on the elevator alone, I've found that I grip (phone, keys, anything within reach) something really hard until the end of the ride.  When I'm walking in public to my car, I wonder if someone is going to pop out from a dark corner and shoot me.  At night, every little bump and noise freaks me out and I have to triple check that all the doors and windows are locked.  I leave lots of lights on when I go to bed in a ridiculous effort to deter home invasions while I sleep.  Worst of all, I'm having a lot of trouble getting myself to close my eyes to go to sleep because I'm afraid of not waking up.

Some other background information might be helpful.  About seven years ago, my father passed away unexpectedly from a heart attack.  The circumstances of his death were somewhat traumatic for me, as I was asleep and was awoken by my mom yelling for help.  Yesterday, my roommate was watching something on TV in another room while I was napping.  Someone on TV screamed really loudly, waking me up, and mentally taking me immediately back to when my Dad passed, putting me in a panic for a time.  I literally hopped up from where I had been napping and ran across my place in a daze to where the noise came from expecting to see something horrible.

I've heard before that a preoccupation with your own death is a sign of depression, but I don't feel particularly depressed.  Obviously, the anxiety and stress stemming from my mental hangup with death is causing me to have some bad feelings, but I was feeling fine mentally before these feelings started to onset.

I'm kind of at a loss about what to do.  I haven't made any efforts to start seeing a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health professional yet, but am starting to think that I need to.  I was hoping that I could just get myself to think rationally about life and death, but I'm not sure I can.  Any thoughts on my situation would be appreciated.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_1cef1g,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1cef1g/29m_im_developing_an_irrational_fear_of_death/,

After being someone's rebound for a month and a half, our relationship ended. I'd like to think that it was actually a good relationship while it lasted, but it was a one-sided. I've never been in a relationship before so I have nothing to compare it to however. We only ever hung out when she wanted to. Still, towards the end of the relationship we opened up to each other in a way neither of us had with anyone else, and I ended up fooling myself into thinking I was in love with this girl. We spent many nights at each others' places and many hours talking to each other on the phone. There was a deep connection there. Her reasons for breaking up with me were because I was graduating college and she was not. At one point she said that further down the line we could try again. She still wanted to keep me around as a friend though, and because I had never been so open about myself to anyone, I naively thought it could work. After a month of me debasing myself in order to spend time with her in naive attempts at winning her back, she got back with her ex.

Looking back on things, I've debased myself so much to this girl. I let myself be manipulated and strung along as a self-esteem boost for her until she got bored of me. I know people say that you should never make your partner the center of your entire life, and while we were dating I feel like I followed that pretty well. I worked as a teacher, went to the gym, took photos, and went out with my friends. But after the break up she kept calling me to hang out, and because I was so lonely I would concede. I couldn't stand the idea that for her I was absolutely nothing, just one of many relationships she had started and ended, where for me this was the biggest event of my entire life up until this point. No one had ever cared, or pretended to care, about me beforehand. Not even my parents. Eventually, I had debased myself to the point where she doesn't even care about me now.  

I find that this cycle of friendship/almost relationship/debased friendship is something that I have fallen into time and time again in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I'm 22 and should have learned by now. In many ways I feel as though I was conditioned this way by my emotionally abusive mother. I have no idea how to stop this cycle from repeating itself.

He was my best friend and i trusted him with everything I had. He was everything I wanted and more, but I was only interested in a friendship at the time. We did everything together anyway, we drank A LOT on the weekends and pushed each other around and sang and wrong music and genuinely enjoyed each others company. He asked me more than once to be with him and I said no every time...
 One early morning after a long night of drinking, I decided to take a shower at his place because I had to go to work the next morning. 

I got in the shower and suddenly the light turned off. I opened the shower curtain in time to see his silhouette against the hallway light before he closed the door behind him. I thought he was joking until I felt his hands probe around in the shower and suddenly grab my wrists. 
He yanked me out and I fell onto him as i tripped over the bath tub. He grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled me to the ground. I was so confused, i started laughing. I was scrambling around on the linoleum floor, naked and soaking wet, trying to get traction to stand. He then pulled my head around to where the back of my neck was pressed against the bathtub and my face was getting splashed by the water. His forearm was pushed against my throat. He started penetrating me with his fingers and biting my shoulders. I remember crying. I remember tasting my tears. I remember his panting and thinking ""What am I doing?"" I thought I was letting it happen. 

I started kicking in a wild panic, which was met with a punch to the gut. It made me physically sick, and i felt as though i was going to vomit. I started coughing and he shoved his fingers in my mouth. I bit him hard and was punched in the mouth. He said ""Bite me again, and i swear to God.."" He continued. 
Eventually, my face was against the floor inches away from the base of the toilet. He had his hand against my skull pushing into the ground, grabbing hair anytime i started to move. He was working his way between my legs, but I started screaming and crying. He monkey pounded his fists against my back and slapped my face from behind until i stopped. I started pretending I was into it (which makes me sick now) thinking that he would stop hurting me. He got his way anyways....
When he was finished I was literally shoved from the bathroom. I ran to the living room and grabbed the first pair of jeans i found which were his. I ran topless to my car parked in the apartment complex parking lot. The first thing I could think was to call my manager at work. He told me to come in immediately and sat me down. He called police and had them pick me up. 
I remember the cop. He said ""You know, I can smell the alcohol on your breath. I believe everything you're saying but this is going to hurt your case"" 
He drove me to that station where I made my statement, they clipped my nails, and took pictures of my face, my back, neck and thighs. The officer then drove me home and i'll never forget the look on my dads face when he saw me that morning. 

As all of this was happening, cops went to L's apartment. I was told later that he was covered in scratches from face to legs. That was enough for them to arrest him. They said he was really scared.
I cannot seem to get over this. I got floods of text messages from his friends saying that I cried wolf and that i ruined his life. His dad was a big time lawyer in town which intimidated me. I got texts asking for me to run away or commit suicide. I dropped the case and moved two states away. Ever since then I have been heavy with guilt. I feel like I betrayed a friend. As if I brought this on myself, and that i lead him on to the breaking point. I still think about contacting him and apologizing. I have a hard time trusting men now because of how much I utterly trusted L. He was my best friend.

The first time it happened was with my first girlfriend in high school. That's no big deal, shit like that is typical of high school level relationships. After 2 years of dating, we graduated and began to make plans regarding possible marriage ( ha ha ha yeah right at 18). It was later I found that she had been sleeping with my best friend at the time on and off throughout our entire relationship.

It happened again after we broke up and I went to college and met a new girlfriend who I fell in love with. We were together for about 6 months, but she was always pretty flaky, so I guess it shouldn't have come as a surprise when I found out she had been sleeping with some guy from her church.

Well, you know what they say: the first time, it's an accident, second time is a coincidence, no big deal. I tried not to let it get to me much and moved on. I eventually met another girl, with whom I shared a relationship of about 8 months. At that point, she got introduced to (who I now refer to as) my scumbag cousin, and began an affair. Shortly after I found out, she broke up with me and they ran off together. They're still together to this day. (First time is an accident, second is coincidence, third time is enemy action. Sadly, too true in this case.)

Finally, I met my (now ex) wife. We were together for 3 years, and moved in together. At that point, she began dropping hints about marriage, so I asked her to marry me and she accepted. The marriage lasted less than a year, as it came to light that she had been cheating on me with multiple men, including her coworkers, and some of my now ex friends. Since the divorce, I have not pursued any new relationships, as I feel like this will just happen again. As such, I feel as though all women are cheaters, which I know cannot possibly be true. 

Is it me? Is there something fundamentally wrong with me specifically that everyone I'm with needs more? I have never cheated on a significant other before, so I kind of feel like maybe I'm just less likeable than they are.

1) ""Girls might not trust you, especially in relation to their men.""

2) ""You don't take much of an active interest in others. Girls tend to  really hate that kind of things, while guys don't mind it hugely, especially when the person in question is a potential sex partner. Girls that aren't good at getting along with others can be selfish. Since guys value sex appeal over everything else, it's easy for such a girl to have lots of guy friends.""

I meet them and within two weeks I feel like I am in love with them. Around this time is when I start to ignore all of my friends and family and do everything I can to spend every second of my day with her. I feel so much for them and usually would not hesitate to marry them right then and there. I start to become extremely possessive of the girl and her time and become very jealous of any guy she talks to, regardless of their intentions. 


Inevitably, there ends up being a disparity between how we feel about each other and I'm usually completely devastated by this and go into what I would best describe as a ""freak out"" mode, causing the relationship to implode because I basically smother the girl with affection and attention thinking at the time it will somehow make it better. After we break up, I tend to really get crazy and do everything from show up randomly to making threats (taking gifts I gave back, hurting myself, general stupid things, never physical threats towards her or anything though) in order to see her again and involve her in the same ""Do you like me?? Why not?!"" conversation that we've had several times already. After all of this any hope that I would have had of dating this person is completely off the table and my credibility and standing with her and her friends is at absolute zero.

With all of that being said, I have had longer relationships, some being as long as two years, where this hasn't been a problem right away, (i'm assuming they liked all of the initial attention and just played along with it) but eventually becomes an issue and causing a break up. 

Sometimes I will say out loud to myself ""what you're doing is wrong, this is fucked up and you're being a creep"" and I still feel compelled to act in this totally unacceptable way. 

I legitimately want to fix this issue, but I don't have the slightest idea on where to start and I'm becoming TERRIFIED that I don't know how to be a part of a healthy relationship. In addition to that, its putting a massive strain on my family and friends who have become tired of watching my mistakes on repeat.  

Is this something I can fix within myself? Do I need professional help? Do I just need to wait for someone that's willing to put up with my personality?

1348163142.0,11,self.ihaveissues,107aor,(25M) I’ve come to despise myself sexually and I’m not sure why.,yourderek,11,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/107aor/25m_ive_come_to_despise_myself_sexually_and_im/,"  I believe when we look back on the events of our teenage years and adolescence, we tend to assign a tremendous significance to the trials we endured, however facile they may have been. I say this almost to disqualify this entire ordeal as “white people problems.” I’m not happy with myself and my life but to any outside observer and even to my friends, it would seem unbelievable. But then again, perhaps that feeling is only a defense mechanism against expressing dissatisfaction and want? I’ve come to second guess everything I say or think or feel, at least I try to.

  Like so many people before me, I was involved in a passionate relationship in high school, beginning when I was 17. It continued on through college and ended after nearly seven years. It was my first relationship, my first everything – kiss, sex, everything. I had to endure watching her crush on other guys for the first few months of our friendship before we decided to go out. It was a situation I can look at now and realize I had no leverage. She knew I wanted to be with her since I had asked her so many times before, but after several guys she went out with and asked out didn’t carry on with her, she came to me. Eventually we agreed to call one another boyfriend and girlfriend and that was that.

  Now I weighed about 240 lbs when I was in high school, I was certainly an overweight kid (though at 6’2” and with my broad, heavy build, it’s certainly not obesity). It got worse as I went on through college and after I transferred out to follow her home. I got up to 290 lbs before it was decided I needed to make a change. She was patient and loving with me through all this and for that I can’t really imagine why. I deserved much less respect than I received from her.

  Eventually, we had discussions and, having been together for four years, she told me she wanted me to lose weight and I agreed. I have a low self esteem, I certainly won’t dispute that. I thought I would feel better about myself and she couldn’t wait to see “how sexy I would get.” I started counting points on weight watchers and eating healthier, avoiding fast food and after six months I’d lost 40 lbs, but I didn’t feel better. It eventually became clear to me that I didn’t just need to lose weight to feel better; I needed to lose weight to become the person that my girlfriend wanted to be with.

  We would go shopping and she would help me pick out clothes that looked good on me. To this day I appreciate what she gave me in the way of fashion sense. But she had a tendency to prefer tight clothing on me. Not that I don’t appreciate it aesthetically, but as an overweight person, it makes you self conscious of your weight and more or less draws attention to it. She would tell me that I would look great in this that or the other after I lost 5-10 more pounds. It became incentive to buy something slightly too small and then to lose weight into it.

  Unfortunately, I reached a plateau at 40 lbs and I couldn’t find out how to lose more weight. I became depressed and self conscious about it all the time. I began to panic in the back of my mind that if I didn’t lose weight I wouldn’t be acceptable in any way. I had clothing that was too small and I began to feel that I was gaining weight. My girlfriend would periodically ask me if I was counting points and would criticize me if I wasn’t.

  I should mention at this point that she had a fascination with pimples and black heads; her own, but also those on the face and bodies of other people. She confessed to me early on in our relationship that she often wanted to pop the pimples of people who remained in sufficient proximity to her. Eventually she would climb on top of me and pop my own pimples. As a young kid with a new girlfriend, I certainly wasn’t going to dispute her climbing on top of me. Eventually this became a routine and she would pop pimples and blackheads on my face, shoulders, stomach, back, etc and request of me to pop pimples on her own body inaccessible to her.

  Eventually it came that I would visit her or she would come to me and sit on my lap and lay with me in some intimate location and her first act would be to pop black heads on my face. I don’t mean to suggest I’m an acne-ridden goldmine to her. I actually have pretty good skin, but her obsession is with black heads. She scans my skin with her fingers like a person reading Braille, before squeezing innocuous patches between her fingernails, creating redness and swelling that wasn’t there before. This was a compulsion of hers that I endured and indulged despite the painfulness of it and despite our crumbling physical connection I could feel escaping from every one of my pores.

  This escalated eventually to her applying make-up to my face before we would go out. She was evidently distracted by red patches or swelling and despite my passive protests she would apply it (even once reapplying it while at a dinner table in a restaurant). She would often criticize the way I kissed (it was too wet, too sloppy) and I wasn’t sure what to do to please her. She was my only kiss, not just my first. This led eventually to kissing more or less disappearing from our relationship. Even in our years together we never made out. That is to say: we never lay down and kissed one another for the purposes of kissing one another. Kissing was a byproduct of other behavior.

  Our sex life really wasn’t that satisfying for me towards the end. I’m sure it was never satisfying for her and I still feel bad for forcing her to endure those years with me. I understand she felt affection for me and wanted to be with me for some period of time, but I was never really what she wanted. She tried to motivate me to lose weight because she wanted a skinny boyfriend, not because she wanted me to feel good about myself.

  I don’t blame her for this and I’m happy for her now that she’s in a relationship and has what she wants. I’ve internalized most of my frustration and anger and I don’t see much of a reason to blame anyone but myself. We eventually agreed to have an open relationship after she left for graduate school. She lived in a city a couple hours away but I would continue to visit her, wondering in the back of my head when she would replace me with someone she wanted more. I didn’t put any value or significance into the fact that we’d been together for so many years. I had been psychologically preparing myself for the news that she’d slept with someone else for three years at this point.

  I continued to visit her and we slept together every time, but one day she called to tell me the man she’d been sleeping with didn’t want to see her again. She was in tears and wanted my sympathy, though the news came as a shock to me, I put the pain I felt in the back of my mind and visited her to offer my sympathy and support. She wanted me to sleep with her, even as she cried about her insecurities and desire to be wanted. It was the end of the relationship, basically. We formally broke up a couple days before Christmas, though we continued to sleep together.

  This period of time was the most psychologically damaging for me. I vowed the day she told me about her other boyfriend that I was going to become a pescatarian (Vegetarian + Fish/Shellfish) and lose the weight I thought I couldn’t. Over the next six months I lost another 40 lbs and ultimately weighed in at the lowest weight of my adult life, but still I wasn’t happy with myself. My ex-girlfriend (at this point) would relate to me the sexual experiences she’d had with her former other boyfriend and other men in sometimes visceral detail. Things I never asked to hear and to this point in my life I have never forgiven her for revealing to me. One night I slept with her and observed her writing in a journal in silence. I was upset and self conscious and the lack of talk before going to sleep made me worry. Against my better judgment I read the contents of her recent entry.

  She described in disparaging language what it was like to sleep with me versus her former other boyfriend. I disgusted her not just in my physical appearance but in my body language, attitude and how I touched her and communicated my desires. I was in an emotional state of shock that I can’t properly exaggerate. The entire foundation of my relationship was gone. I felt like the subject of an experiment, the plaything of a sociopath that told me she loved me only to feel wanted herself. I’d never experienced in my life, before or since, what I felt in that moment: total and complete abandonment.

  I’m certainly not void of blame myself. I could have read the tea leaves and removed myself from what was becoming a toxic situation. Particularly after learning she kept secret from me at least a couple relationships. But still, we had six years together and I was hoping if not to remain her boyfriend, then to remain her friend. We spoke on the phone for hours every single day we were together (this is not an exaggeration, there was only 1 day that we didn’t talk to one another in our years together). I couldn’t imagine a life without her considering we essentially graduated adolescence together.

  After this moment our relationship dissolved entirely and eventually she just had another boyfriend. It’s hurt me in incredible ways that I’m still coming to understand. I don’t blame her for it, I’m a victim of the circumstances we found ourselves in and she wasn’t spared her share of emotional torment. Her compulsions and insecurities are not insignificant and I wish I could have done more.

  Eventually, though, she asked too much of me. I had given my support, being there for her and helping her feel loved and wanted during the months she vented about other men’s sexual exploitation of her. But the problem became clear to me when I couldn’t take it any more. I was supporting her, but I was unable to ask support from her. I felt betrayed intrinsically. I couldn’t trust her with my emotions and I didn’t feel any longer that she cared for me or loved me. Eventually I broke down and begged her to stop talking about her boyfriend or sexual behavior with other men. I put on an emotional display of which I didn’t think I was capable; but when it went ignored and she sought me again for consolation and went into more detail than I needed to hear over sex with another man. I just had to accept that she wasn’t going to listen or change and I just stopped communicating with her.

  It hasn’t helped me, however, in trying to get past my absolute hatred for myself. I weigh 210 lbs now and I don’t feel any more adequate than before. Even my ex-girlfriend would ask me how much weight I’d lost in a week or month, as though all the weight before it (80 lbs total) didn’t matter unless I lost another 20. We used to have a fairly difficult sexual relationship. Like so many other men before me, I really enjoy getting a blowjob. Unlike (it seems) so many other men… I don’t feel I ever deserve one. In fact, I don’t think I deserve any kind of sexual gratification or satisfaction.

  My ex-girlfriend would not volunteer to go down on me (can you blame her? At one point I was 290 lbs! I was despicable), though I was a fan of going down on her. It was necessary for me to ask her to go down on me and though often she would oblige, the few times she didn’t seemed more upsetting and critical of me than maybe they should have. On top of that, she never actually got me off with her hand or mouth, though I will take the blame for this, I was too disgusting to go down on for long enough and didn’t deserve it anyway. Eventually, she would describe to me how other men she was with would tell her (either vocally or physically) to go down on them and told me I had to be more aggressive.

  She had also told me an anecdote about a guy who secretly ejaculated in her mouth and how she was upset about it. Whenever I would sleep with her I would visualize these other people with her, the visceral descriptions gained all the more life when I was with her physically. I was terrified of asking her to go down on me because all I could imagine was how the scenario was playing out with her and another man. I’d lost my identity. I felt as though I was an actor playing out her sex with others.

  Eventually, after reading her description of me sexually and learning how she really felt about me, this combined with the prior insecurities and I felt completely disgusting. I felt like a pig whose desires never deserved to be fulfilled for my very physical identity. I began comparing myself to other men, wishing I had a smaller frame, wishing I didn’t have gynecomastia, wishing I had fewer blackheads and pimples (I continue to pop these to this day, insecure that other people notice them as well as my ex did). I don’t feel satisfied with what I am, I can only see the deficit, I can only see where I’m falling short or where I don’t measure up. I’m not saying I have blinders on, but I have this critical perspective on myself where any mistake is inexcusable. I feel the need to be perfect and funny and charming at all times or else people will understand how truly awful and disgusting I am. I feel this need to hide myself, or to constantly hide my faults.

  Interestingly, I have never dwelt on how others think of me. I simply don’t consider it. I honestly do not think anyone talks about me when I’m not there. I don’t worry about it or feel insecure about it. I also don’t think people talk about my positive qualities or achievements. I described this once to a friend and they said to me: “It’s like you don’t believe you exist.”

  It’s certainly something I’ve thought about since I realized it was so consistent. I wouldn’t characterize myself as a loner. In fact, I think I can entertain a group of people well enough, I’ve given lectures and I’ve had a radio show, I’ve written for free newspapers and contributed to literary magazines. I don’t hide and I’m not a recluse, I love being around people and in crowds. Going to concerts and house parties are some of my favorite things in the world to do but I really don’t care if anyone knows I’m there or knows I exist. I can enjoy being in a crowd without talking to a single person. I enjoy the atmosphere and the energy. I enjoy being in the middle of it all.

  At the same time, I deliberately avoided getting my picture taken in high school. For my senior year I never got a portrait done and I didn’t show up for any of the group photos for the several clubs I was in. I made a conscious effort, more or less, to recede. I didn’t want other people to know I existed or to know my name. When I was upset and depressed for about a year, I often fantasized about suicide and wished I could just disappear and everyone would forget I existed and no one would be bothered or upset about it. I don’t want my ex-girlfriend to live a life of misery. I want her to find happiness and satisfaction and I want her to move on and away from me.

  Even regarding sex, I would rather not exist. If I could just make a wish and I would never want a blowjob again, I would do it. I just despise myself for having desires at all. I wish I could be a different person and so I might deserve some of what I want, but it’s impossible. I want to work on my issues and become a person who’s comfortable with himself and his needs and wants, but it’s been so long since I felt comfortable asking for anything I don’t even know what I’d ask for.

Compared to fame, wealth, success... anything really; Love takes precedent in my life. 

I love everything about being in a relationship. The attention, the sex, the cuddling, just knowing everything about someone, being important to someone... I love being in a relationship. 

I won't be in a relationship with just anyone though... I'm so ridiculously picky when it comes to women. Which probably explains why I'm single for so long and find decent relationships when I do. (In one of my single spells as of March)

I don't get to date much. I'm shy, and not the most sought after guy by women (Gay men **love** me ironically enough)

And here is where my story takes a sudden twist. I've recently had a girl pretty much fall in my lap. Someone I dated years ago. She knows everything about me. What makes me tick, she accepts me for who I am. We ended up sleeping with each other this past weekend. And it's obvious she really likes me. 

Yet I'm hesitant. Aside from the glaring fact that she does have a  three year old son and an ex-husband. I don't know how I'd feel if those things weren't a factor. 

She can give me everything I want. She cares about me. She's sexually active, she's honest, yet I don't want her in a romantic sense. I believe this would be the case even if she didn't have a son. 

For someone who complains about being lonely all the time this baffles me. I want something more than her. And I feel like a huge jerk for feeling this way. 

I want her to stay around. The sex was phenomenal. She remembers all of my little buttons. Even buttons I had completely forgotten about. I enjoy her company, the cuddling, the bickering, but I don't see anything long term that I would be happy with...

Now I have to tell her that I feel this way because I don't want to lead her on. And I don't know how she's going to react. Best case scenario - She's cool with just keeping things light. Worst being she flips out on me and never speaks to me again. 

All I know is I'm in trouble. I'm starting to like her, but I know me. I'm not going to want what she has to offer a few months down the road.

I'm F/23 and for the purposes of this post, I live alone in an old converted loft with my cat. 

When I was 19, I acquired a stalker. I had met this person once previously while working for campus police, and we interacted for a maximum of two hours in a professional-only capacity. After this period, he managed to acquire my cell phone number and class schedule, and stalked me for several months. Although I had a restraining order, it culminated in a home invasion while I was in class one day. The individual responsible had communicated to me several times that he was bipolar and unmedicated, and suicidal ""because you won't let yourself love me back."" He was arrested, convicted on multiple counts and as of a year and some ago was residing in a psychiatric hospital. 

I have since moved 2200 miles away. While I feel I am generally a pretty balanced person with no serious lingering issues, I have a hard-and-fast rule in regards to my home. While people know the neighbourhood I live in, only 4 people have the full address and have ever been inside. **I simply do not feel comfortable allowing acquaintances in my home.** I love to go out and meet in parks or for beers/lunch, I am not agoraphobic whatsoever, I just do not want people I don't know well to have my exact home address. In the time I have lived here, other than family members I have had four close friends over (who knew the score and respected my wishes) -- I just needed to know them better before inviting them over for wine and movie night. All of them are now welcome happily in my home. 

However, through volunteer work I have made a new acquaintance. He's a nice enough person, although he seems to be very interested in forming a...physical relationship, no matter how many times I explicitly decline. He has been repeatedly asking if he can come over, trying to guilt trip me into letting him stay over because he doesn't drive and lives outside of the public transit routes. I have repeatedly and explicitly told him that I do not let people come into my house because I am uncomfortable with it, and I have personal reasons that have nothing to do with him. I'd rather not have to explain that I was stalked, because honestly it's none of his damn business and he needs to respect my wishes without being given a reason here.

(UPDATE)",thr00000w4w4y,11,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/xzyqc/longgone_abusive_so_still_controls_me_update/,"[Original Post.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/vcgm0/longegone_abusive_so_still_controls_me/)

I figured I would post an update since posting here was the first tine I had shared what happened, and it motivated me to talk to my husband.


Some of the things that I had left out in the original post were details about the depression. As much as I hate to admit it, I had been injuring myself. Razor blades, burning myself, scratching myself. I had also just let myself go pretty massively. Most days I had no will to even brush my hair. I would even go out in public wearing bleach stained t-shirts, house shoes, and Pajama pants. I didn't really care because what was the point? I was just an ugly girl and any attempt otherwise was just like putting lipstick on a pig. 


As soon as I spilled the details to my husband, he became very supportive and affectionate. He was very sincere each time he complimented me. Even when I would disagree he made a point to say that I was just viewing myself through a very skewed glass.


He encouraged me to do things that made me feel better about myself. I started taking the time to do my hair or make up, get a pedicure. It hasn't really been in a superficial tone... just in a way that I feel better acting as if I love myself. Even if I don't completely love myself yet, I would say I'm off to a good start.


There have been days where I even roll out of bed, no makeup and bedhead.. but I still feel okay and can recognize good things in my reflection. I still have days in which I accidentally catch my reflection and feel disgusted... but not as frequently. 


My mom has also been encouraging me. She encouraged me to buy lingerie and dress up. I bought the lingerie and pumps for my husband's benefit. I nearly had a panic attack before I revealed myself to him. But it was worth it. His physical and verbal response was just... amazing. It was weird to so quickly go from absolutely hating myself to actually feeling sexy.

And all of these things have been a great boost to my confidence in every aspect. For the first time iin a long time, I have felt intelligent and just really capable of everything.

I'm not quite there yet but I really feel like I'm in the right direction.


My fears were met, though. Just this past Sunday I ran into the ex at a grocery store. 

A lot of emotions caused by that. With trying to improve my confidence I've been dressing nicely and getting dolled up before I go anywhere. I think that caught his attention and I almost feel like I won. Because he didn't see the shell of a person he intended to leave behind. He saw a woman that appeared to by fine, unscathed by his bullshit, and happily spending a Sunday afternoon with her family.

He tried to talk (we were on our way out) but I completely ignored him and kept walking to our car. My heart was pounding, I was shaking and I felt physically ill. My husband asked what was wrong but I asked if we could just talk about it in the car.

My husband wanted to get out and just obliterate the guy but I insisted jail time was not worth this miserable excuse of a man. My husband said things like ""at least now I know what that piece of shit looks like for future reference"" but I don't believe he would do anything. 

The aftermath of that is that I am somewhat scared that he will try to find me. I know he gets a thrill from fuckin people's lives up and if he thought he could fuck mine up again, he would.

So then I realized that he cannot ruin my life. He cannot put a wedge between my husband and I. He cannot undo the beautiful children we have - or even the one I am currently pregnant with.

He may have created a lot of pain.. but he **cannot** erase the happiness and satisfaction I have since gained.


And I think that finally liberated me. I think that finally made me stop believing that he controls me and I cannot explain how amazing that is. He is nothing. He is finally nothing.


I didn't even hate myself after seeing him. If he does try to contact me, I will immediately do what I can to make sure it never happens again.


So, in **tl;dr - I am actively improving the way I feel about myself. Its going to take more work, probably for a long time, but that doesn't overwhelm me. I feel okay.. I'm more affectionate and sexual now and that is only improving my already wonderful marriage. Ran into the ex and realized he can't harm me aanymore. **

1343989486.0,11,self.ihaveissues,xm4q3,I just had a major personal breakthrough and want to share. Deals with losing passion in life.,godlesspaladin,13,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/xm4q3/i_just_had_a_major_personal_breakthrough_and_want/,"Hey everybody. I just had a (hopefully) life changing epiphany and I wanted to share it with you here in case there is someone else having similar issues. Just something to think about. It seems obvious now, but it's taken me two years to figure this out.

Two years ago I lost my passion. The subjects of my passion are ultimately irrelevant and not the focus of this post, but I provide them for context. 

I used to be passionate about history. How did I know I was passionate about this subject? I realized that my thoughts would always drift back to it. If I was talking to someone, or trying to get a task completed I could focus, but left alone and my thoughts went right back to history.

I loved history. I got excited about it. I went to college to study it. I wanted to be an archaeologist and interact with history. **The point is my passion was a positive one, it was built on the love of something.**

Well roughly two years ago my passion started to die. I didn't know why. Suddenly I wasn't happy anymore. Meanwhile my personal life was collapsing around me. Three year relationship in shambles, beloved family member with cancer, graduating into a recession with no job prospects, moving to a new state and losing all my friends/connections, shit sucked. I was (not surprisingly) deeply depressed.

It was during this time that my passion started to shift. I thought it was vanishing, but what was actually happening was that it was changing forms.

My new passion turned into religion and politics. I had always been interested in these topics, yet they consistently took a back seat to my love of history.

**These new topics made me furious.** I was filled with rage and a lot of other negative emotions whenever I thought about these two topics. (Specifically the injustices and atrocities committed under their umbrellas) They became my passions, or rather anti-passions, in the sense that my idle thoughts would always drift back to them. Naturally I would become upset and angry whenever my thoughts led me to contemplate these topics, and since they became my default, I was angry all the time.

**My new ""passion"" was a very negative one, built on rage, whereas my previous passion was built on love.**

I believe this was a reflection of what I was experiencing at the time in my personal life. During this period I felt very listless and adrift. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I no longer had a passion and thus no direction.

This was because my anit-passions had no productive ends. When I loved history, I had a goal, something I wanted to achieve. I had direction. With my new passion all I had was rage and negativity, nothing to strive for and accomplish.

What I have to do now is find something that I love and somehow make that my new passion. I'm not sure how to do that yet, but I take comfort in the fact that I have at least finally identified the problem.

We have only been officially going out for a few weeks however we have been on multiple dates and I have known him for about 6 months.

So i'll try and keep this short and to the point.

I didn't want to have sex with him because I felt he should know how messed up I am before making that leap and commitment in our relationship.

However I ran out of excuses and I couldn't find it in myself to say ""No"" so I let it happen anyway and now I am racked with guilt.

I have been in several abusive relationships and I have also been raped.

I also have Autism (my bf knows I am Autistic)

Due to an emotionally abusive relationship at a young age and I believe partially due to the Autism I lost a lot of my self worth and felt like I was only good for sex - despite being a virgin.

This led to me developing an extremely unhealthy view of myself and allowing myself to get into stupid situations, dangerous situations and bad relationships.

As a consequence I have let myself suffer through a lot of shit and I really don't feel like I am worth anything at all.

I constantly feel dirty and disgusting after sex, even though I enjoy it at the time I just feel like a whore afterwards and I don't know why. But I don't want to tell him any of this because I don't want him to think it has anything to do with him at all, because it doesn't.

My boyfriend is so kind, he's the most wonderful person to have in my life, but he is constantly buying me things and complimenting me which I find incredibly and deeply uncomfortable.

I do not think I am worth the gifts, or the dinners he cooks for me and I certainly don't think I am worth all the labels he places on me with his compliments.

I had to fight tooth and nail to be able to pay for Macdonalds which so far is the only thing he has let me pay for.

I hate seeing him go short to try and please me when I don't even want the things he gets me, I'm just happy that he's here.

I feel guilty that he buys me things and I feel guilty and disgusted with myself for letting him do that and for letting him touch me in any sort of intimate way.

I have told him I don't like him buying me things and that he doesn't need to compliment me but he just says he is treating me the way I deserve to be treated.

I feel like shit also because he is totally open and honest with me about his past and things he has been through whereas I have put a 10ft thick brick wall.

I recognised that I have a tendency to act up in order to push people a way so I have purposefully been keeping myself in check so as to not let this happen.

Instead though it seems like I am just avoiding talking to him so as to avoid pushing him away.

Now I feel like the relationship has reached a point where I have to tell him this stuff about me otherwise i'll just push him away and I really don't want to do either of those things.

So: **tl;dr How do I tell my bf I let him stick his dick in a crazy?**

Side note: I fully understand that my behaviour and feelings about myself stem from my own faults and that if i'd just said ""No"" to start with things wouldn't have gotten this far this fast and there wouldn't be a problem.

I do understand that and I know I did the wrong thing for this situation.

Need some help.,givemeallofyourfeels,13,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/vowk2/im_afraid_i_may_have_some_deep_personality_issues/,"Male, 22. I've had a little success with dating, but never had a relationship that has lasted more than 2-3 months. Most of them have just turned into short flings. I think I have some personality issues that have been the root cause of most of these short-lived relationships. I started seeing a girl (23) a few weeks ago and things seem to be going well, but my mind races about certain things and I'm afraid they will manifest in a way that will ruin yet another relationship. For example, crippling jealousy at most of her interactions and mentions of other guys. Also jealousy towards her great career and more active social life. Constantly thinking that she isn't really interested in me and is just playing me along, despite every indication that she is. Over-analyzing every detail of our interactions together, from sex to phone conversations. Making sure I did things right, making sure I was ""cool."" Irrational obsession with everything about her. Thinking about her constantly, in general.


The thing about all of these issues is that I generally keep them suppressed and hidden well. I don't come across as clingy, I'm not questioning her about other guys she comes into contact with, I don't show that I'm madly obsessed with her and concerned about what she thinks of me, etc. Instead, I keep my torturing deep within. The ruining of relationships seems to come from my mind trying to turn me against her in some way. My mind starts assuming that the relationship is not going well and finds something negative about her so that I can assume that it will end soon and I won't be heartbroken. Or I start thinking that I'm simply not good enough for her. Once my mind turns this way, I start seeing the girl differently and my attitude towards her changes for the worst and my interest wanes. All in all, I'm getting the indication that I'm hopelessly insecure and feel inadequate.


But I wonder, how much of this simply comes from lack of experience and naivety? Anyone else have similar issues that were worked out with time and experience? Or is this something that I need to get addressed by a therapist? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

It's, as far as I can see, the only thing holding me back from a lovely, healthy life of relationships and sex. In all other areas, I'm self-confident, proud of what I've done, and am doing, in life, have some good friends and some good hobbies, have a fitness routine, and all of that. That's all fine. (I'm 20, almost 21 and male, by the way)

But, for the life of me, I am utterly averse to saying anything flirty to girls. It's not an attraction issue - I really have a romantic interest. There's a couple of sub-issues:

1) I don't know when, after meeting a girl, I start being flirty
2) I have a general idea of what flirting entails, but I have no idea about how to steer a conversation that way.

The core problem, though, is that I have a perception that if I even as much hinted at a girl that I liked her 'in that way', which I clearly do, it's almost *illegal*, weird or seen as really, really creepy for me to do so. For example, I met a girl I liked the other day, added her on Facebook and was just chatting along. I wanted to be flirty, and say something like 'you're really cute, by the way'. It's not that I'm scared of rejection; of her saying 'aww thanks but I don't see you in that way', etc. It's that I'm scared she'd delete me and tell her friends that this 'weird guy' expressed an interest in her. I suppose the other fear is that, if she's actually like 'I think you're cute too :)', I'd think I'd mess it up.

I've asked out plenty of girls before, and it's really only just occurred to me why they all seemed a bit neutral/odd towards me. They were wondering why I was talking to them but not being at all flirty or interested romantically. So when they saw that I wanted to hang out with them, they'd be conflicted - here was this guy who was talking as if entirely platonic - 'how was your day' sort of thing, and he wants to hang out. 

So yeah, [[/r/ihaveissues](/r/ihaveissues), what's the way out of this mire?

1331135435.0,10,self.ihaveissues,qltyt,Feelings of rejection intensify as I get closer to others,,12,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/qltyt/feelings_of_rejection_intensify_as_i_get_closer/,"(This is x-posted from /r/relationship_advice as I was hoping to get more response.)

Hi all,

It's been a long time for me to realize this (M26) and it pertains to my relationship (F24) but also many other aspects of my life, importantly my friendships. I have been told often that I seem to have very many close acquaintances but very few close friends. I wondered for a long time why that is and I think it's because I have attachment issues.

**The conditions**

I realized that as I grow close to people, I don't deal with rejection very well. At first, closeness gives me this intense desire to be even closer with them and, when they ultimately ask for a little space (flake out, fail to reciprocate, don't return calls/txts, etc.), I wind up feeling completely rejected and kicked-to-the-curb. Cancelled plans are probably the worst but even other things like getting skipped over on invitations causes great envy in me. I internalize my rejection to a great deal, to the point that I'm *absolutely certain* that people hate me, they're repulsed by me, and think I'm annoying, dumb, or choleric. That turns in to feelings of bitterness towards myself and them.

People generally perceive me (at first) as friendly, attentive, considerate, and outgoing. I always walk away from time with friends feeling recharged and with a positive outlook. After long enough, though, things seem to slip. As instances crop up where they can't make it out or otherwise, I find myself feeling cast aside in their lives, as if they've used my time and now they're sick of me... or perhaps they were sick of me all along and were just keeping face. I feel like I do a LARGE majority of initiation, like 70-80% of the time, when folks ""make plans"" (e.g. ""We should grab a beer sometime!""), I'm the one who later says, ""Hey, wanna meet me at the &lt;X bar&gt; tonight around 9?"" to no response.

Another funny --possibly relevant-- thing is that gift giving does not build relationships for me at all. Whereas others like giving and receiving gifts, I hate that process because I feel very self conscious in picking gifts. I often wind up getting nothing for others and feeling guilty about it and I feel even *more* guilty accepting gifts from others. It feels like it's such a vain thing to me. I get especially weirded out when folks give me things as an apology, especially when they blow off some plans to hang out repeatedly and want to make up for being a flake.

I also ""reject myself"" and feel great hurt. Even little things, like getting lost, lead to me cussing at myself and hurling insults about how dumb I am, how I'm worthless, and (for whatever reason) selfish.

The last thing is that I tend to stay in relationships too long. My tendency to ""stick-it-out"" in romantic relationships leads to months of staying with a partner who makes me feel shitty and depressed. All my dating history has been LTRs (average of probably 1 year each). I don't even try to resolve issues in the relationship, because I tend to view it as a compromise and put my needs on the very lowest rung of the ladder. It's like, ""Well, &lt;A girl&gt; does this, but it's okay because I don't earn much money (or) I don't have a car (or) I don't have an excellent body.""

**The history**

For a long time I wondered if it's me or them, but this feeling has gone on since I was very young. One significant circumstance which I suspect may be related is my mom's separation. My parents are separated, I'm estranged from my birth father since age 3, and my step-father who raised me is also separated from my mom. The only other possibly traumatic experience I can mention is that one of my best friends took his life in high school. It was a hard experience for me, hardly eating or sleeping for weeks and crying every day. However, I felt like it was a time of closeness and I felt good that many of my friends were there to support each other. 

I've wondered if these experiences could, in some way, make me feel as though relationships are very volatile and need to be confined in close quarters, lest they could vanish in a moment's notice. This would explain why I expect my friendships to sublimate from the occasional happy hour to spending days together on end. As if my strategy is to either immediately get close or prevent myself from getting close.

Argh... Reddit, help! I think this is the biggest barrier in my personal life and I can't seem to cross it. I want to feel content with my relationships and ""meet people on the level"" so to speak. And yet, I find I'm totally stagnant. Has anyone dealt with this before and can you recommend resources or tips or mantras... whatever helps you to keep sane, happy relationships.

- I over analyse people that I'm anxious about interacting with, leading me to see all the bad aspects of people and lose attraction.

- Quite successful with girls in the early stages.

- When I feel like things might be going somewhere with a girl, I end up over analysing the situation and losing attraction, which kills my motivation to continue to pursue things. (A lot of the time this happens with friendships too but this is less of an issue imo).

I've always been and felt socially inept, even when it comes to socializing with my own gender.

It is somewhat due to my social ineptitude that I haven't finished college yet; when, at the same time, all of my high school friends have graduated and have moved on with their lives. So add little self-confidence to that growing list.


Anyhow, to continue, what brought me to this sub-reddit is to finally ask for help with my issue of trusting people, especially guys.

It takes me a lot of time and nerves to even get up the courage I need to ask a guy out. And when I flirt, I don't know if he knows I'm flirting; and I can't tell if he's flirting back or if I'm just seeing things I want to see but aren't really there. (**main problem**)


I guess what brought all these insecurities to the surface is the most recent object of my fancy, a 24 year old male who is in all 3 of my classes this semester.  He and I are majoring in the same subject, anthropology, and have 2 anthro classes together, with a random ""Introduction to Public Speaking"" class thrown in.

*(As an aside:  It's uncanny, really, that there would be 2 anthro majors in the same speech class, because hundreds of speech classes are taught every semester and there are only roughly ~100 students in this major.  Our department is so small that we share it with Sociology.)*

Back to the topic at hand, this guy I'll call 'K' is ex-Army (Airborne). He joined up right out of high school and is now out and going to college.  He told me he served in Iraq for a significant time period.

**My point is this**: I've never liked a guy of this background before. My previous boyfriends have been geeky technophiles or nerds of the highest order (Intelligence is attractive). I know how to read geeks but this guy just confuses me.  I really want to get to know him, but other ex-military guys I know just don't want to talk about their time ""over there"" and I understand.  I just don't know how to start conversations with K.

We've actually had conversations about stuff unrelated to anything at school, which I take as a good sign.

What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. Me.

**TL;DR**: I denied myself sex with the girl of my dreams, found I couldn't cry, and started laughing in some horrific manner until I couldn't breath. Please, read it, and please, I need objective advice, so I find I can't turn to family and friends. Please. Give me help. I need it.

I'm nearly 21, I'm alone, and getting more and more lonely every day.

I have definitely been in love before. I can count the people I have ever cared deeply about on one hand.

Each case follows a predictable pattern: We meet and get to know each other, I fall for her, let my feelings build up inside until I'm fit to burst, blurt it out to her, then get heartbroken when she doesn't feel the same. This generally causes the platonic element of the friendship ending.

The last time this happened, it affected me really badly. It took me the best part of two years to get over her, and it's only now that I'm starting to notice other women. But now that I'm noticing other women, I'm terrified that I'm about to fall into the same pattern, all the while aware that I'm not getting any younger.

I really, *really* want a relationship. I want to be with someone who's as deeply attached to me as I am to them. I want someone I can hold and touch and adore and so on. The fact that I'm still a virgin makes me feel even more insecure and depressed. I know people who've had healthy sex lives since their late teens, and it really upsets me that I haven't been able to experience that level of intimacy.

I haven't even kissed a girl before. Lately I've been seeing a girl I'm interested in, and the closest I've gotten to kissing her is a pathetic peck on the cheek. Meanwhile, time is passing, and she's slowly becoming yet another female friend that I'm hopelessly attracted to.

I'm quite academic, and since the start of college I've spent the vast bulk of my time studying. This has gotten me good grades, but at the same time prevented me from getting out and meeting people.

What the hell am I doing wrong? I've read all sorts of bullshit advice about 'being self-confident' and 'hitting the gym' and 'going for it', and so far none of it is helping.

How can I get over the fear that all that men want is sex?,downthewell,13,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/k4cb2/shutting_guys_out_how_can_i_get_over_the_fear/,"I understand that this is partially insecurity on my part, and that it arose from specific recent experiences.

I was a ""serial monogamist"" in the past, going from one LTR to the next throughout my high school and college years.  I ended my most recent one after I had cheated multiple times (after becoming a LDR and generally struggling on all levels) and decided I needed to seriously sort my shit out before I could be in a relationship.  I didn't disclose this to my then-partner because by the time I had admitted it to myself, I had made up my mind to end it and didn't see the value in causing them any more pain.

However, more than a catalyst for break-up, those incidents seem to have had a great impact on me.  Perhaps it was the ""loss of innocence"" (I had never cheated before) and the resulting disappointment in myself (manifested as intense guilt over the betrayal of my internal morals).  I still am fairly unforgiving about cheating, if anything I'm now harsher about it because I've been through it and have absolutely no sympathy for any party who engages in cheating.  That is to say, I have absolutely no sympathy for myself, although I think the other parties involved should have tried not to be.

My current problem with guys is based on the primary observation that most guys I considered friends, immediately tried to make moves on me after my break-up.  And if I turned them down, they would stop talking to me or wanting to hang out.  The first several times I was pretty upset about it, I had lost some people I considered good friends (although later I realize they probably weren't that good of friends).  As I tried to start dating again, the overt desire to eventually sleep with me before even knowing me just pushed me further away.  And the guys I met through friends (usually at a party) seemed to be out for the same thing, if anything at least they were more upfront about wanting that threesome right away.

I started to feel that men were only interested in me as a sexual object, which was further validated by the continued experience of men approaching me for sex and friends trying to solicit me for sex.  The feeling of objectification started to make the sexual attention feel predatory (in combination with some actual sexual harassment I experinced) and I could no longer trust any ""innocent conversation"" from guys.  To deal with it, I started ignoring all the guys who I felt were overtly hitting on me or just trying to meet up with me.  I distrusted all new approaches, and the guy friends I once had dwindled to pretty much nothing due to having retreated after rejection.  I think I now have a full-blown self-perpetuating paranoia that I think is entirely unhealthy and not helping me move forward.

So... okay.  Guys do want sex.  Humans want sex.  No surprise.  But I don't.  Not right now.  Especially not from any of the guys who I feel are ""after"" me.  Maybe my experience of external sexuality differs too much from my own.  It *feels* like I have no power over my own sexuality because it doesn't matter what I think, I will continue to be sexualized against my will and in ways that I do not consent to.  There couldn't be a bigger turn-off in the world, feeling objectified.

I really wish I felt similarly, that I was able to reciprocate this attention... instead of feeling dehumanized and disrepected.  What is this?  Why is this happening?  I wasn't raised to feel this way about sex.  Nor did I in the past.  How do I get over it?  I want to have real relationships with men again.

Throwaway account here. Always lurked reddit, but never bothered to register.

Long story short, I'm turning 27 in a month, and aside from a girl I was in a relationship with for about a year awhile back and a girl I dated semi-seriously last year, I've never really had much luck with girls. I've got the rest of my life in order - I've got a master's degree, a proper career and a plan for it, a decent new car, work out and train regularly, have a quick mind and a reasonably sharp sense of humour, and have been expanding my network of friends over the past few years. For all the work I've put into getting my life in order, I've still never even been close to tearing up the V-card, never making it past first. The issue started weighing on me around the time I finished university, and it's just been getting worse since then. I feel I can't talk to anybody in real life about this, so I figure this is my best bet to get some advice.

If it makes any difference at all, I'm also Chinese-Canadian, and still live with my parents even though I own a home, with an aim to speed up dealing with the mortgage. It's as much a financial thing as it is a cultural thing. I have no religious beliefs that keep me away from sex, though I don't believe in casual sex, a stance which is sort of wavering because of the lifelong drought. Getting professional help with it is out of the question, since I know I wouldn't be able to live with the thought that I'm so unwanted that the only way I'll ever get any is if I pay for it. I've been reading up on dating materials (not PUA stuff), and trying to apply the stuff on flirting and being romantic, albeit without much luck so far.

To sum it all up, it's starting to feel like a Catch-22 - I want to find a relationship, but I haven't been successful with that to date, which affects me even more in a vicious cycle. Now, I have friends who are getting married, and some even have kids, while I haven't even had my first time yet. So my question, reddit, is this: What can I do to get enough momentum going with dating to get a girlfriend?

I've always had trouble interacting with other people. I hate to say that I only have new friends (and am not too close with the notable exception). In pretty much every social circle I've ever been in things would 'end' eventually, either awkwardly or dramatically. I graduated high school with zero friends to hang out with that summer and I signed up for a year at community college just so I could learn how to make friends. While I figured a few things out nothing really 'stuck' and I didn't make any real connections (though to be fair it was a shithole).

I’m 19 male and feel I’ve wasted my childhood on video games and anime instead of doing the ‘exciting’ things kids typically do. Not because I avoided it but because my social skills and attitude were so bad that almost nobody liked me. I hardly went to any parties in high school and these days when I go out to drink I feel myself resisting the urge to spew depressing thoughts and almost always fail. And that’s probably the main problem.

I almost always have a bad feeling about something. When I take away all the self affirmations and pick-me-ups and happy mental routines I organized in my head there’s self pity through the roof. My default facial expression looks angry so whenever I just need somebody to talk to I give the impression that I want to kill everything in sight.

I tried stifling these negative thoughts with sheer mental force because I don’t want people to think of me as a downer, but what happened instead was that I ended up resorting to a fake smile, and while some people are good at pretending, I’m not, and I’m familiar enough with others who behave like that to see why it was so off putting.

It’s been a year since I finished high school and that day I made it a personal goal to “fix” myself and put my life where I really wanted it. I hit the gym, looked for a therapist, googled advice on how to make friends and practiced things like body language and building confidence and the rest, and a year later I can observe my situation between two extremes, depending on the mood I’m in.

When I’m feeling good, I congratulate myself on the progress I’ve made and am assured that I already have what I want and it’s just a matter of time. When I’m feeling bad, all my accomplishments are illusions and I’m just a rat running in a maze. I’m fundamentally “broken”, I’m hardwired to my destructive patterns and I’ve already seen the full extent of where my life can go in those moments of humiliation and exclusion.

I’m going away for a month in less than two weeks and will be meeting a ton of new people, but I’m scared I’ll fuck this up again because of my defective nature. Finding a therapist covered by Canada’s nifty health insurance plan is extremely difficult and I don’t know what will happen if this trip ends the same as everything before. I wanted to make this post for a really long time now but I couldn't articulate everything till I actually sat down and ironed it out of my head.

So… yeah. Advice?

I'm a 23 yr old, Female - virgin, never dated or kissed anyone.


I'd rather be in a romantic relationship with a guy. The problem is I'm barely physically attracted to men (only &lt;&lt; 1% of guys). Now I know this sounds extremely shallow, but appearance is *not* the only attribute I care about. Personality matters as well; I cannot tolerate jerks. Also, I don't really experience sexual attraction to anyone (men or women), regardless if I find them attractive or not.


My close male friends believe I have high standards and I should lower them. And I'm repressing my feelings about sex/intimacy. I have tried giving the only 5 guys who showed interest in me a chance and I did not like leading them on (although they were very nice). And I am not afraid of sex, I just do not desire it at all. Would I compromise? Possibly, if I eventually met the right person. But I'd also be quite okay if I never did have sex at all. Am I looking for someone perfect? Maybe to other people. But nobody is perfect, and I wouldn't describe those guys as perfect.


Honestly, the whole psychology behind attraction is pretty complex and I cannot even explain why I have strict preferences. I do not have a racial, height, hair/eye color,etc preference. I don't believe the media has influenced who I find attractive, because often times I disagree - I do not find most actors or models attractive. I am not afraid of relationships. It's pretty frustrating.

I am not seeing anyone (I have another other recent post about very, very rarely feeling attracted to anyone - once in my life really) right now so I guess this is more of a question on how to improve my relationships with friends and how to not be like this in a future romantic relationship, though the bit where I discover my issues begins with a romantic relationship.

""Family issues"" background context: I suspect I put so much weight on romantic and friend-relationships because I can no longer rely on my family for unconditional love and support. We have some drama related to homophobia and cultural expectations of success and responsibility and what a good daughter should be. I've signed legally binding, impossible to break (unless I win a massive lottery) contracts negating my dreams because of my parents, resulting in a lot of resentment, and that's about all I have to say about my family. I do not want to go home (alas I must) and am dreading living at home this summer with a family that only loves and accepts me under certain conditions that require me to pretend to be someone I am not, both in terms of orientation and life goals/dreams.

Back when I was in a LDR, I excessively needed constant affirmations of love and importance, and wanted to be shown that I was a #1 priority in my ex's life constantly. Because my ex was the entire universe to unemployed, out-of-school me - near the end I sort of had a gut feeling that I was losing myself in the relationship [like this other redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tcgy8/ive_completely_lost_myself_in_my_relationship/). I wanted to be shown a lot of affection but - here's the thing: I was! Shortly before we broke up I went through logs of messages we'd exchanged and they were affectionate, reassuring and loving and you could tell that my ex was really trying hard to make me feel better in response to me saying that I felt unloved, I felt like a bad girlfriend etc. 

But all that just bounced, bounces, off me - I was reading the words, but I didn't believe them. I'd print out nice messages and cute drawings with hearts from my ex, and paste them in my diary, and reread them often. But I just couldn't believe that I was being loved and cherished, and I don't know why. This still happens now. We talk as friends now, but I get really insecure that they  (used as gender neutral singular) don't care about me, that I'm just a disposable friend who'll be set aside, because they only get enthusiastic when I'm talking about intellectual/academic things or shared fandom interests. And it feels very much like an out of sight, out of mind situation. I follow their blog daily, and also get jealous when they're having fun with or talking to other people, because it seems like they're enjoying it and they never want to have fun with me, only with others.

I have been planning to talk to them about this for several months now, but I don't really know how to approach the issue, or if I'm being too needy. I'm trying to understand that this is their personality - to be passive and asocial; they're like this with their other friends too. 

Now, **I know rationally that they care about me more than they do for most people**. I know that they must like talking to me, because *they have told me before*. Several times, at various points, usually when I express inscurity but once of their own volition. They tell me that they think I'm a great and interesting person, and that they appreciate me being their friend and that they're sorry if it doesn't always seem that way. Most recently yesterday, when in a bout of sleepiness I apologized for always being boring and just talking about inane things, there was a ""You're not boring."" - but these just bounce off; it doesn't even feel like I've heard them; they don't touch anywhere deeper than somewhere around my ribcage. Loving words do not touch my heart. 

Fast forward about a year to now, the end of my first year in college abroad in the US. I never really cared much about friendship in the past - I had a small core set of friends whom I'd see at school and sometimes hang out with, but we didn't really talk outside of school and I was fine with that. But since coming to college and aforementioned family rejection of my identity and dreams, having friends has become a lot more important to me. I don't have many. There's only one girl here whom I really feel close and connected to, and then there are people who are a bit more distant than that, but still people I consider friends. But yeah - the same thing as with my ex is starting to happen. People here are busy, and no one initiates things with me unless they're paid to do so and to keep tabs on me (my RA asks me out to ice cream or lunch a few times a semester, for instance). I think that's the main way in which I feel loved, but I also understand that I can't just sit around and expect people to initiate things.

Again, I know rationally that people here care about me. I know this because sometimes when I'm having a public crying fit they accompany me and pat my back until their arms are sore and then they switch arms and continue to pat my back. I know that they like me because they talk to me instead of going off to play games or work on papers or something. One of my friends calls me affectionate names (but then she does for everybody) and several others have said things to the effect of ""you're really sweet"", ""you are great"" etc. to me. But once again those just bounce off, and it still feels like the people I care a lot and want to be closer to about just don't care about me.

I have been working on the neediness seriously for about five months (before that I kept trying too, but I had not enough willpower) through a cold-turkey approach where I am trying to train myself out of the instinct to freak out and get upset when I'm ignored or overlooked. It's been tough, especially at the beginning, but I'm constantly trying to remind myself that it's ok, that it doesn't mean that other people aren't interested in me. When I notice myself being upset, I try to identify the cognitive distortion and supply an interpretation that doesn't involve me being unwanted, or when I can't come up with that, I just try to tell myself that everyone needs space to be with their other friends too.

But that's still ignoring the root of the problem: I am so needy - and then why can't I accept it when people make attempts to satisfy that need? Why can't believe that people like me? Why do I need this sort of constant reassurance, and then when they *do* show it, I can't believe any of it? And ... I guess...I often feel like I am lying to myself and grasping at straws when I tell reassure myself with the 'evidence' that people like me. Why don't people want to spend time with me and have fun with me? Maybe why is not important, but what can I do about it?

I saw a school counsellor/therapist for about five sessions for crying all the time (related to feeling unloved), but school insurance is ending in a week and I only have one session left. We never really discussed anything important. The most useful thing that therapy uncovered was that I am quite out of touch with my emotions. Being a scientist and too intellectually-inclined has also made me try to work through my feelings rationally, even though I don't really know how and it's (as described elsewhere on reddit) ""like moving water with a shovel"". As a result, when feelings do hit strongly (e.g. when I feel unloved - although I KNOW rationally that it's not the case) I don't know how to deal with them and end up crying and crippled/unable to do anything and *I don't know why I'm crying*. It's just static in my head.

On the advice of my therapist, I now try to meditate for a few moments every day (not sure if I'm doing it right) and focus on the physical sensations I am feeling so that I can start associating sensations with various emotions. I also started using www.moodscope.com to provide a daily point for me to check in with regards to how I am feeling. But even if I'm more aware of my emotions, how do I deal with them? I now know that when I feel a weird pressure in the mask of my face and heaviness in my chest that means that I'm upset and it's usually linked to feelings of being unwanted, but then what do I do with those feelings of being unwanted?

I feel like I've taken one small step on the road to becoming more emotionally mature, but I don't know where to put my other foot.

TL;DR'd questions:

1.  I am so needy - and then why can't I accept it when people make attempts to satisfy that need? What can I do to improve this?

2. I often feel like I am lying to myself and grasping at straws when I tell reassure myself with the 'evidence' that people like me. Why don't people want to spend time with me and have fun with me? Maybe why is not important, but what can I do about it or how can I convince myself that I am NOT just pretending that everything is ok and that people like me, and that everything really is ok?

Thanks for all the great comments everyone. I needed every one of them. It finally made me look at the situation in a more objective way, and realize my mistakes. I got emotionally attached to an incredibly impulsive, restless girl too soon, and I had to pay.

We went on a trip last weekend, and Friday we had a walk and had a discussion. Basically, I told her that I simply wouldn't survive in the relationship when if she would remain so restless. To which she countered that she didn't think our relationship would actually survive at all. And I agreed. And that was that.

The irony of it all? She has decided not to go on her year-long-trip after all, since she realized being a nanny for a year would actually be extremely stupid. 

We had a great weekend, and for the first time in weeks we had genuine fun together again, without all the emotional baggage.

I guess I should start at the beginning. I was in a relationship with a girl who I had known since I was in 6th grade about 2 months ago. She was recently separated from her husband and a divorce was pending. Her and I hadn't spoken much the entire time she was with her ex, 7 years(we're both 26). We got together and she really rushed the relationship, staying over my place just about every night, buying shit for my apartment, having sex just about every day. It was easy for me to fall for her I guess, since I had always had a crush on her and this was almost a dream come true. 

Anyway, things started to get rocky when she realized a relationship was not what she wanted, at least with me. We came to a consensus( a rather dumb one, mind you) that we would see each other for sexual needs only, etc. that lasted roughly two weeks. Wednesday of last week she came over and I had to work that night, I work overnight, but my roommates were off and they were going out to a local bar and she came with. 

Literally the next day, she said she wanted to have the freedom to sleep with whoever she wanted, but still wanted to see me. I said no, and she got her shit and left. Not going to lie, I spent the whole day fairly depressed, working on getting over things and trying to move on.

She called me later that night, talking about how she was upset because of her ex and this and that, and she wanted some sympathy and it played into my vulnerability. I talked to her and consoled her(I should have just told her to go cry to someone else). She made mention of wanting to come over sometime and talk things out. I said yes.

She came over the next day, presumably to see me. I had just got back from the gym with my roommates, aparantly she texted One of my roommates and said she was going to make lasagna. News to me. 

She comes over and brings her kid(who I adore, a 2 year old) and says she needed to get pasta for the lasagna, she asks me to watch the kid while she goes. She's gone for a while and I had to work that night and get some sleep, so when she got back I pretty much went to sleep. 

I woke up, came outta my room and noticed her and my one roommate, who well call Steve, were talking on the couch. It was an awkward vibe like maybe I was interrupting something. I went back in and took a shower, and after I left they were both outside the apartment taking. Again, there was this awkward vibe and tension and I left to go to work.

I text her when I'm at work to tell her how I felt awkward and asked if there was anything going on with her and Steve. She didn't respond. So the whole night I'm feeling anxious and paranoid. I left work early and came home. Her car was still in the parking lot(3am) and I rushed up Stairs to find her naked in his bed. 

As you can imagine, yelling and screaming commenced. I called her some names, flipped chairs over and walked out.

Eventually I found out that when my roommates and her went out last week, the other roommate, who we'll call Jay, encouraged her to break things off with me completely and sleep with Steve. For what reasons I can only assume is because he is a giant gaping asshole. 

It should be noted, I helped these two get really good jobs at we're i work. Steve was on my staff and was promoted because I pushed for it heavily. Jay works at nother location. I don't really feel like they owe me anything, but I would have expected this not to happen. At least right?

So my situation is I live with two awful human beings. One of which works with me. I have to see these people all the time. I don't have the means to really move right now. But I don't know what to do.

I feel like I'm going crazy. And I'm incredibly angry all the time. I don't know what to do about work, but a transfer would be near impossible right now too.

Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I don't know if I would call it ""molestation"" per say. I don't really know what it is and I pushed it to the back of my head until I was about 16. I started having sex and I ended up telling my SO who did it and what happened.


I can't pin point what age this was but I must have been about 7 or 8 at the oldest although I remember multiple occasions of this happening. 

I would sleep in her room like a mini sleepover and she would touch me and get me to touch her. I finally asked my mom one day in the car ""what happens when two girls have sex""

I obviously knew it was wrong but I didn't understand what exactly was going on. My mom asked me why and I told her I had sex with a girl. She finally got it out of me that it was my sister. When we got home me, my mom, my dad and my sister all sat down and I had to repeat what I said. My sister denied everything. They kept asking me if it was a dream. It wasn't. I still remember things to this day and that it happened on multiple occasions. They pushed it off as a dream.

You have no idea what it feels like to have no one believe you. They stopped after that and I tried to push it back in my mind and forget about it. But like I said, issues have risen with sex. I have major depression, anxiety and OCD I have scars from cutting so badly. I feel like this could be one of the reasons why I suffer from so many disorders. 

My sister and I have a perfectly normal sister realtionship to this day and I have not brought it up to anyone minus a close, close friend who knows I was molested but not by who and my ex SO whom I was with for 3 years.


I don't really know what to do. I am completely and utterly ashamed and embarrassed by this. I don't want to bring it up to anyone. I am so afraid. Can someone offer me advice or maybe help me figure out if this was molestation or maybe just child experimentation? I don't know. Was I molested or was this something else? Please help reddit.

Since I was five I felt there was something wrong, even repellent that others feel when they're around me. I've worked hard to overcome it, and I now have lots of friends and people who look forward to seeing me but romantic relationships have always been elusive. 

I have dated, but the time I have been involved in a relationship is infrequent. I've had 3 ltrs, and all have averaged less than 1.5 years. Each had one foot out the door the entire time. I've stopped having casual sexual relationships 5 years ago, hoping that would help. It hasn't. Guys will express interest in fucking me but don't want to get to know me beyond that. 

My friends tell be I'm attractive and would be great as a lover/parent (&amp; they are male &amp; female, gay and straight). However my entire life experience has kept reaffirming that I am not wanted. I can't recall the last person who wanted more than just a fuck from me. I'm tired of the pain this causes me, constantly getting my hopes up, and the constant rejection.

Then I decided it was a good idea to meet up with him.

Met up, made out, had an insane connection and he never left my mind.  Decided I wanted to see him again. Made out again and the connection and my feelings for him grew.  I told my bf about him and my feelings (conveniently omitting the making-out part) and said I had to pursue this guy basically whether my bf liked it or not. I said I just wanted to have sex with the guy and then I could continue to give our relationship my full attention. 

Miraculously, after the hardest week my bf and I have ever went through, he agreed to let me see the guy one last time and do what i need to do.  So I did. And it was incredible.

It's been four years since I have had really any sort of feelings for a girl and it's starting to worry me a little.

I'm quite comfortable in my own skin these days, which didn't used to be the case in my younger years (but who was, back then?). I don't feel any overwhelming need to be in a relationship or anything, but sometimes I do find myself thinking about it and that it would be nice.
I regularly go on dates but though I've met a lot of really nice girls, I haven't felt even so much as a little chemistry with any of them romantically. It's no fault of theirs most of the time, and I can't really say that there's any one good reason or red flag as to why I shouldn't feel anything for them; but it just doesn't happen. I feel bad about it too sometimes because there's been a few that I can tell/they've told me that they're really into me and I have to back out. I haven't always handled it the right way either which is something I'm not proud to admit.

I guess really what I'm trying to figure out is if this is normal or common. It doesn't kill me that I'm not in a relationship and I figure there's not a whole hell of a lot I can do if I just don't meet a woman who I feel fondly about, for a very long time. But I can't help but let it bother me a little bit, particularly since I'm closing in on 30 and typically my age seems to be where people begin to engage in truly meaningful, substantive relationships that have longevity. I certainly don't want to force anything or jump into something merely because the option is there, that isn't doing me or the girl any favors by being in a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship.
But I'm to the point where I can't even conjure the memory of feeling ""butterflies"" and that worries me a bit.

I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text. Even if I don't get any response to this, I just needed to get this out on a page.
Hi. I'm a 22F who is experiencing heartbreak due to another self-sabotaged relationship. It was going so well - he [27M] treated me so well, we had a wonderful connection, and things could have been perfect if I hadn't ruined it... again.

I have casually dated many guys since I was 18, and I have always been the one dumping these boys for the same reason - I didn't want to be tied down; they wanted something more serious; I didn't feel 'ready' for a relationship. The idea of having a boyfriend made me feel uncomfortable and insecure. As though it would limit me in some way or bring me down. Usually a couple months later I was 'sorta' dating someone else again, and soon I was repeating my pattern.

The last two times I've done this, I've completely broken my own heart, twice, along with theirs. And I can't seem to learn from it, which makes me wonder if I'm insane. I'm going to see a counselor about this, but I could really use some objective (and harsh) advice from you as well, because you people seem to offer pragmatic, objective, and often insightful advice.
My pattern is rather uncanny because it has happened in the same timeline 3 times: meet the guy in the spring/summer, dump him in November, and by January desperately want him back again. And my heart is always broken by the end of all my crazy antics, and the guy I so desperately want to fix things with is just trying to get away from me.

I meet a guy who sparks interest in me, but at the beginning I'm generally indifferent and let him do the chasing. I usually express to him at the very beginning (and then keep telling him this as the relationship goes on) that I'm not looking for anything serious (the reasons have been: I'm graduating college and could be moving abroad; I plan to move abroad; or I'd like to focus on me).

Around month 5 or 6 into the relationship, things reach a high point. The guy is really into me, and willing to do anything for me. We've developed trust and attachment for each other. I'm quite happy, in spite of myself...
Then, I fall into my pattern: my doubts about myself, which I've kept at bay throughout the relationship, come spilling out due to a trigger. Sometimes the trigger is stress, or sometimes I feel completely annoyed by a minor thing the guy says. Sometimes it's an article I read, or something my brother says. Like ""That girl is too awesome to be caught up with a boyfriend."" In my mind: ""Am I not awesome? What am I doing wrong? What is wrong with me? THIS is why I've never reached my potential.. The only answer is to break up with so-and-so. Then maybe I can become awesome?""

I have never referred to any of these guys as ""boyfriend."" It makes me uncomfortable to have us ""In a relationship"" on facebook, so I never do it, often causing some insecurity in the guy. I usually never tell my family or friends that I have a boyfriend as it makes me feel... strange. Like I shouldn't be dating someone. Or that I have to hide it. For two reasons: 1) because I seem to be a serial 'casual dater' and this embarrasses me. Makes me feel fake, shallow, or flakey. and 2) because having a boyfriend is just distracting from focusing on me, and thus it is something 'bad'.
Family background: my mother has always been controlling, demanding, and overbearing. Throughout college, when I was home for the summers working, she would take my laptop and phone in order to force me to cut contact with the particular guy I was seeing. She would tell me I should focus on myself, that these guys were wrong for me (either they were ugly, or weird, or something else - there was always something bad about them), and scream at me if she found me talking to them. I eventually began to hate myself for dating a guy. Yet I kept doing it... and kept hating myself while I did it.

(Note: I'm not trying to blame my mom for my problems. I'm just throwing this in here so you can get a bigger picture of who I am. Ever since I was probably 10, I've always had this weird dichotomy of longing for companionship, yet having a natural fierce independence. So I've had many, many crushes growing up yet have never had a real serious relationship because I always break things off. And then start casually dating someone else. I had my first real ""love"" when I was 17. It was the same pattern - he was into me, I was disinterested, by November I'd detached myself. By late December/ January, I desperately wanted to be with him again. We got together but eventually he kept breaking up with me, on-and-off, and I was in love with him for 3+ years after that... Ever since, I've always been the one doing the breaking up.

When I was 18 and a freshman in college, I sorta had a brief, month-long romance with a long-haired, goofy-looking musician I'd met in my science lecture. I kept talking to him for the first few weeks of summer after I was back at home, working. My parents knew about him and tried to force me to stop skyping him or talking to him. This guy wasn't exactly the most handsome guy, but he was incredibly sweet and very talented, and we got along and liked each other. At one point my dad told me, ""You better not ever end up marrying an ugly fuck like [musician] and making fucking ugly babies."" I eventually detached myself from him and felt myself moving on.

From when I was 14, until I was about 20 or 21, my mother had access to and read through all my recorded internet conversations - gmail, gchat, facebook, everything - so she knew about who I was seeing and how I felt about them. She's seen most or all of my private conversations with friends and guys I've been seeing. I have only been able to begin disengaging myself from her emotional and psychological influence since I graduated college and have become financially independent.

My mother was also very demanding in other aspects of my life. I was never working enough or doing well enough. I had a total 17 different jobs throughout college but she was never satisfied. I worked in restaurants, freelanced, wrote for the school paper, had many internships, and usually worked 2 jobs at a time while being in school. Over the summers I typically worked 3 jobs (2 paying jobs + an unpaid internship). I worked many, many, many double shifts. It was never enough.

I could never be good enough, for myself or for my family. My brother is a highly successful computer programmer who shares my mother's mentality. Although I graduated from a well-known school with a high GPA, two majors, plenty of solid internships on my resume, good portfolios, and 2 full-time job offers, and am now financially independent, I still felt (and feel) far behind. That I never fully pursued my talents to their potential. That I could have done more with what I was given, had I not wasted my time on petty things like boys or Facebook, or sometimes giving into my depressive tendencies.

So these things come up and haunt me in any relationship I enter. During my senior year of college (last year), I entered a relationship again with the same symptoms (I had been single for about a year before this, and I had been very happy while single. I was scared and unwilling to give up that happiness of being single, yet I let myself date this guy with the same doubts and insecurities beginning to pop up more and more): I wasn't doing enough to focus on me. I didn't have time for a boyfriend, what was I doing. He was making me feel insecure and jealous, and I didn't like that. I wanted to be single for my senior year of college because I was in a transitional period and I saw no reason to be attached or in a relationship. We might move to different cities in 6 months and what would happen then? Why should we be so serious?

By November, finals were approaching and I just lost it and broke up with him. My stress level from taking 6 classes, working 2 jobs, and impending graduation took itself out in my usual pattern. I told him I didn't want a relationship. I was careless. He was heart-broken.

A month and a half later, I wanted him back. In January I asked him to meet with me and I explained to him: ""Hey D, I've thought about this and I realized being single doesn't make me any more happier than I was when I was with you. And you never distracted me from school like I automatically thought. My biggest distractions were my roommates and myself... I really like you and I'd like to enjoy the rest of our time in this city together, and we'll see what happens in May."" He agreed but unfortunately by then he'd mentally disconnected from me. How could he trust me again? How would he know if I'd just leave him again at the turn of a hat? Things were never the same. He ended up slowly detaching himself from me in the next 2 months. He cheated on me for a month, lied, and then we went through a messy break-up. I was rock-bottom, and blaming myself for it all...

Then bring in 27M. I met him during my time of heartbreak. I was graduating in a month then moving to Europe to work for the summer, with the possibility of staying there for the job. We had an instant connection, the first day we met. I told him I had just gotten out of a relationship; on top of that, I was just graduating; I had things to figure out; I was moving to Europe and possibly not coming back; I wasn't ready for a relationship... We just hung out and hooked up a few times. Then I left for the summer.

We kept in contact. He was naturally a very committed guy and he wanted something more, so he was waiting for me to return to the city. I was doing my own thing abroad, traveling alone, thinking of my career, and making new friends. But I still thought of him, never hooked up with another guy because I didn't want to jeopardize the potential I had with 27M, and knew I had to make a decision. Either I enter a period of independence after my heartbreak and focus on me; or I give it a shot with 27M because he was just such a gem. I chose to give it a shot with him. I told myself I wouldn't repeat my pattern of self-sabotage. That I would open up to him and trust him. That I wouldn't break things off when I felt that stress or my self-hatred/ self-doubt creep in again. That everything would be okay.

I returned to the States in the fall, to the city, and began working full-time. 5-6 months after meeting him, and things were flowing wonderfully. I was happy and so was he. He reduced my level of stress. We cooked together, treated one another with respect and care, and talked through any misunderstandings and conflicts. We were compatible.

When my fears that I wasn't doing well enough began sinking in again... I told myself that 27M didn't hold me back from pursuing my dreams. I shouldn't worry about that... When I spoke of pursuing an international career, he got excited and began thinking of ways to get a job overseas, too. He said he would travel with me and would support me in anything I did. He was ambitious, smart, and hard-working... albeit a homebody and a committed 'relationship guy.'

I was so stupid to throw it away.

But the fears and the doubts kept creeping back in. I began to feel like I was in a box: I didn't have as much freedom as I would if I were single... I couldn't just leave the city and travel the world without putting him into the equation. I was young, he would be 30 in 3 years. He wanted marriage and kids eventually (though not right now). I was finding it hard to see that in my future (it might change in 10 years).

On top of that: Why did I keep jumping from relationship to relationship? I hadn't been single in more than a year, and that was making me uncomfortable. Why did I have this pattern of dating so many guys? Was I really just insecure and unable to face myself, so I hid behind the comfort of a stable relationship and a stable guy like 27M? Was I just setting us both up for heartbreak? Didn't I really envy my friends who were 22 and 23, single and lighthearted, who weren't emotionally-exhausted or tied down like I was? Who were free to do what they pleased, without worrying about a boyfriend?

So then, one day (in November! surprise surprise), my stress got to a high point (I had been working 7 days a week for 2 months. A full-time job, and a weekend restaurant job). I said it: ""I see myself being single at some point in my 20's as I travel again... I'd like to focus on myself and figure things out.""

27M freaked out... he was of course hurt and upset. I e-mailed him a few days later hoping to clarify and reconcile things. ""I don't want to break up,"" I told him. ""I'm sorry for making a big deal out of that... I'm unhappy with myself and so I blame the relationship for it, but things are good between us and I'm happy with you... Let's try to keep it that way.""

A week later he broke up with me because he ""couldn't be in a relationship that he knows will end."" But we saw each other several more times in December, said ""I love you"" to each other, and cuddled in bed. I wanted to find a compromise. I wanted to find a way to have my independence within the context of a relationship, while learning how to make him feel more secure and not place an expiration date on the relationship. I wanted to tell him that he never limited me from pursuing my dreams, that it was an automatic pattern for me to say ""I want independence over a boyfriend,"" but I'd never truly thought it through. That I didn't want to repeat that pattern.

It was too late and by the time I'd finally had time to sort through what I wanted, he decided we should do No Contact. He never gave me a chance to talk to him.

There it was, I sabotaged things again... and I repeat my exhausting pattern yet again. I lost something wonderful. It's sinking in now... I have dreams about losing things I cherish, but the dreams are always about him. Why couldn't I make up my mind when I had the chance? Why was I always pouring my drink in the sink? Why did I throw away good things, sabotage my own happiness? Why couldn't I learn to take care of the things that deep down, I truly did cherish in spite of everything... I blew it, and broke both of our hearts.

Why do I do this and why do I never learn? What can I do to stop this? Please help.

TL;DR: I have a horrible and exhausting pattern of dating many guys, but always breaking things off because I want independence, or because I'm afraid of relationships, or because of my own self-doubt and self-hatred; then I want them back when it's too late. I've broken my own heart twice, and I can't seem to learn from my mistakes.

She says she’s happy with me, but seems bored with sex and uses a vibrator almost every time I leave the house.",Throw_Away0001,14,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/16deuu/my_30m_sex_life_with_my_girlfriend_28f_of_16/,"**This will be long, as I’m desperate and want to include enough information to get some real advice. There’s a TL;DR at the end.**

My girlfriend and I have been having issues (sex related and not) for a while now. As you’ve probably guessed, everything was fantastic when our relationship started. We both had admitted to having pretty high sex drives, and had several (3-4) months of fantastic sex a few times a day (roughly 10-20 times a week). We connected on a lot of things, and had wonderful conversations. She’s beautiful. Honestly, she seemed perfect.

I knew since we started dating that she had some issues she was working through with a therapist, namely depression and an eating disorder that she had received treatment for. She was amazingly honest with me about what she was dealing with, and though I could see the ways it affected her, I respected her a lot for getting help, working through it, and being honest with me. I tried not to underestimate how those issues might affect her, and their potential for causing problems between us, and I was willing to truly accept them as part of her and her struggle.

In Jan. of last year, she had a falling out with some friends and suffered some depression. We started having real arguments around this time, and sex quickly dropped off as well. I did my best to take it in stride and be supportive, understand where the arguments and lack of sex were coming from. I won’t say that I handled it perfectly, but I did the best I knew how. She (and her therapist) even thought I was dealing with it well.

Not long after this (early Feb.), a couple of boxes showed up at the door. I knew she’d ordered makeup, and was trying to be interested and excited with her. She was hesitant to open one of the boxes, and I tried to push her to open it (honestly, I’ve been that way since I was a kid; a box can’t arrive at the house without me needing to open it. I get excited). She finally gave in, saying something like, “Oh, I know what this is, I ordered it for us,” as she pulled a vibrator out of the box. Something in her voice seemed disingenuous, and it was clear it was something she ordered for herself and didn't want me to know about. I felt weird about it, but I tried to move on; I didn’t want to get too weird about a vibrator, but it was hard to be comfortable when our sex life had already taken a dive (down to 2-4 times a month). I tried. Hard.

Over the next few months, I tried to work on our relationship. I did all I could to talk about our issues, ask if there’s anything I could do, and let her know that, if she’s unhappy with us or our sex life, I’m willing to talk and try new things. She’s always attributed our problems to other things, and still says she’s completely happy with me, in and out of bed. At one point she even said that her sex drive just isn't that high, contradicting what she’d said before.

We started living together in June.

A few months later (Sept.) it came out that she had lied to me about a few things. Things that seemed potentially big, but turned out to be smaller (hiding that she had gone some places, and leaving out details). I got the truth out, and those things actually ended up being small, and mostly to do with things she's self conscious about (dropping a class, missing an appointment). She told me about the vibrator, and said she rarely used it. This was hard for me because she lied about it for so long. I also learned how much she’ll deny any lie, to the point of almost needing photographic evidence before she’ll come clean.

Fast forward to now, and things are still in a rough patch. We're having sex more often now (2-3 times a week), and I’m glad that has improved, but it’s awkward. Ever since last Jan., sex has always seemed force, like it’s a chore for her, or worse, a favor for me. She tries to seem mostly interested, but there’s always a hesitation to it, and I can tell she’s less than interested. She’s never interested in much more than a quickie. Beyond this, the romance just seems gone for her. A lot of days go by without a kiss. I have tried to talk several times, ask what I can do (everything from “is there something you want in bed that I’m not giving you?” to “what chores can I take around the house to help you out more?”), and it just doesn’t help. She’s distant almost all of the time, but swears she’s really happy with me. I don’t actually know how often she uses the vibrator, but I know it happens more than she says. She says once a week-ish, but I know when it’s moved and she forgets to turn off private browsing. I don’t have a problem with the vibrator (quite the opposite), but I want to know why she seems to go straight for it when I leave, but has little interest in me.

I’d love any help I can get. I love her, but I’m desperate.

**TL;DR:** A year ago, after months of great sex, my girlfriend stopped being interested in sex or romance, and hid ordering and using a vibrator from me a few weeks after. I’ve tried to work on our relationship and offer to do anything I could, and give her anything she needs. She says she loves me and she’s happy, but is distant from me (even during sex) and runs for the vibrator whenever I leave the house.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_16deuu,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/16deuu/my_30m_sex_life_with_my_girlfriend_28f_of_16/,

Basically, I worry I won't ever be able to have a proper relationship because for some reason the idea of my girlfriend eating until she is stuffed makes me extremely anxious...like extremely. I don't even know why. For example, I am dating a girl currently and she just texted me saying she had a nice three course meal for lunch and is now ""so stuffed"" and for some reason that makes my stomach churn with nerves. 

Okay, so I have some sort of eating disorder I may or may not project onto other people, right? I mean I fear feeling full myself. I mean, I am still a healthy weight, so it doesn't really matter. 

But the thing is...girls stuffing themselves turns me on. So what the fuck? When it's someone I care about it scares the shit out of me, and yet when it's a stranger on the internet it turns me on? On top of that, I've always been more partial to curvy girls...so even if any girl I was with actually gained weight, it wouldn't bother me at all, it'd actually probably please me. And yet, it still scares me. It's not even just that though, when I went on a date with this girl, the other day, I sort of wanted her to stuff herself...it turned me on. So, it seems that it's only when it's a person I care about and I am not actually there that it scares me. 

The only conclusion I can come to is it's a control thing I have, I like to be able to control my girlfriend's actions and thus when she is away from me and stuffs herself it scares me, because I am not in control. But that's just a hunch. It'd be great if someone could either A.) explain to me what the fuck is wrong with me or, even better B.) give me some sort of solution, or nudge in the right direction because it's sort of starting to damage the relationships I am in.

More than 8 years ago, my girlfriend was the woman of my dreams and she was just as in love with me. Right around the 1 year mark, we started having the conversations that you naturally have - do you want marriage, do you want kids?  My answer is maybe to the first and definitely no to the second. I'm open to adoption, but I have severe moral dilemmas with bringing new life into this world.  She disagreed, so despite being madly in love we part ways. That sucked. 

I've kept in touch with her, met up with her in the spring of 2011. It was the first time we'd both been single, we hooked up, she still loves me, I still love her, same issue still stands. She shared with me how tough it had been dating knowing that she had to eventually inform some poor schmuck that she was still in love with me, but she'd been figuring that out and navigating. The same way I had. It sucks. 

I met my most recent girlfriend shortly after that. We fall in love, she understands, and I am clear from the first f***ing date that I don't want kids. Marriage, for me is a formality of an already intact arrangement - not off the table, but doesn't carry the same weight with it as it does for some.  For me that commitment comes earlier. 

We celebrated our one year anniversary on Oct. 15. She turned 29 soon after, and went from hating kids to *knowing* she wanted them in her future. She grew distant, reserved, and we broke up last week. Because she wants kids, and a wedding.

In talking this through with friends I keep hitting a brick wall. That it doesn't matter that we spent a year with the same expectations. She has an inviolate right to change her mind on a whim about these major life things, and there is nothing to be done about that. I, mostly, agree with that. I mean, you can't be a controlling jerk about these things, but seriously? WTF? Look at it from my perspective. I got burned this way once. I communicated it clearly from early on, re-affirmed it many times, and suddenly BAM! Same thing. 

Now, two does not make a huge sample size, I've dated a lot more, just haven't gotten as serious with others. You obviously can't guarantee people won't change their minds, and I know I'll find someone eventually. But in the meantime, do I really need to keep burning more than a year at a pop just to, I don't know?, help someone through a process of self discovery just to wind up getting dumped? Is there a way I could be going about this better?

Why is adoption anathema to some people unless there is no other option?

Is there any way to make this process easier? I little safer for me? 

And, seriously, is there just a universally accepted notion that if I'm the one not wanting the traditional relationship progression, that I'm in the wrong? My friends who, dammit, should be supporting *me*, are largely taking up her case and trying to convince me to change my mind about kids. What's up with that? 

**tl;dr** How can you avoid getting deeply involved with someone before finding out they want kids if telling them upfront doesn't work?  

edit: After some reflection, I'm probably over-exaggerating the friends not being supportive thing. They aren't really taking up her side, more just throwing up their hands and saying, 'what can you do', and my general emotional state is taking that further than it is intended. Mea culpa.

The first instance was this summer. I'd just heard about gonewild and the idea really appealed to me - I'm a closet exhibitionist and the idea of hundreds of strangers jerking off to me just turns me on really quite a lot. One night I'm drunk, and he's been having long hours at work and has to keep turning me down in bed. I have a high libido to say the least, and I was finding it so frustrating I would literally end up crying, I just hated the rejection. I know it's pathetic, but that's how it is.

Anyway I find myself on gonewild, and before I know it I've posted something. And I'm hooked. I upload an album next, and the high I get off it is insane. I can't stop refreshing to see how many upvotes and comments I get. Once I finally come back down to earth at about 5 in the morning, I realise what I've done and feel disgusting and pathetic.

He is the loveliest human being but he would just take this so so badly, so I decide to just put it in the back of my mind, I won't do it again. But after summer I go back to college. One night I'm randy and up for Skype sex, but he's tired so I'm left sad and frustrated. In spite of myself, I find I'm on gonewild posting, and then all of a sudden I'm on the gonewild chatroom masturbating in front of strangers and loving it. I orgasm, but even as it happens I can feel its cheap and shallow and not that pleasurable and not worth it and feel loathsome. I promise myself again I will never ever do this. 

A month later, I do it again and promise myself the same thing. 

Two months passed. I didn't think about it, it had faded from my mind, things are still going great with my man.

Then, for absolutely no fucking reason at all, last night I just find myself wandering onto to gonewild page for a peek and before I know it I'm flashing my tits in front of total strangers. 

I just want to get this out, because maybe if I say it out loud like this it will finally hit me what a disgusting human being I'm being and will actually never do it again.

I was 13, trying to find my place in a dog eat dog middle school world. I tried track and was horrendous at it. I tried a gaming club and didn't fit in. Finally, I reluctantly tried out for the middle school play. I'd never sang or danced before the tryouts, but much to my surprise, I got a callback anyways. So, there I was, sitting in the middle school auditorium... alone, awaiting my turn to sing 12 bars of a highly edited kidified version of Luck Be A Lady from Guys and Dolls, when suddenly, a girl sat down next to me. My heart rate immediately quickened as she started a conversation with me. We immediately hit it off. Up to that time, I'd never had a fruitful conversation with a cute girl before. Not one. We soon became great friends, and talked close to every day. I had a serious crush on her, obviously, and likewise for her. However, these crushes would come and go, and we'd never seem to be into each other like that at the same time. It was horribly frustrating. We'd end up having our own relationships away from each other, and our own heartbreaks. We'd counsel each other, further strengthening our friendship.


Come senior year of high school, I was very big into theater, and as was Morgan. We began hanging out a lot more that fall, because we were in a show together with a very small cast, which was much more intimate than the huge musicals that we did in the spring. We eventually ended up hooking up (for the first time in our 5 year friendship, mind you), and started talking about a relationship. After we finally got into it, I was absolutely ecstatic. This was a girl who I had loved for 5 years, who I would jump out of bed to go to school for, literally just to see her for 15 seconds. And our relationship was absolutely perfect... Until I fucked up. This fuck up will be wholly described in Part II, but I should probably get into the 'death' thing that I mentioned in my sensational title.


When I was 14, after suffering from 2 mild heart attacks over the course of a year, I was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, which is a rapid and sometimes irregular heartbeat originating in the ventricles of the heart. The heart attacks degraded the muscle tissue in my ventricles leading to the disease.
The events come practically every day. I'll be sitting, studying, playing guitar, or whatever, then suddenly my heart will pound out of my chest. The palpitations are often so intense that they can be clearly seen through my shirt.
My cardiologist said that my case was one of the worst he's ever seen, not even considering my age. And, because of the delicate scar tissue in my ventricles, each time one of these events happen, my condition worsens.
My cardiologist said this past summer that the odds of me having another heart attack within the next year is ""near 100%"". He also began to delicately tell my parents and I that heart failure is practically almost guaranteed, and with the condition of my ventricles worsening practically every day, he expects it within the next 5-10 years. The Only possible solution to my problem is to get ventricular reconstructive surgery, which will lead to improvement of my symptoms; however, it is not the end all, and will probably just end up delaying the inevitable.


**PART II**


I made out with another girl in May, and she found out in August. She was most hurt that I lied to her for 3 months about it. I lied because I was disgusted with myself after the incident, and I swore to myself that it would never happen again. Ignorance (so I thought) was bliss. She broke it off the day that I went away on a two week vacation, which I was going to come back from, and be home for 3 days before going off to college. I fought for her, because she is the love of my life. It took a few months of ups and downs, and me trying to earn her trust back before, finally, this past weekend on her birthday, I put everything that I had into trying to win her back. I went out, and bought 5 presents that were wholly inside jokes about our relationship, and wrote on each of the presents one word of the sentence ""Will You Be My Girlfriend?"". We sat in her living room as she unwrapped the presents and read the card, and when she was all done, she leaned over and kissed me and said ""I thought that we already were."" I was ecstatic. However, the next few days she was being horribly distant. I called her, to no answer. Finally, last night, she called back, and told me that she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted nothing to do with me. I didn't think it was serious, but after I asked around, I knew that this was the way that things were going.


I go home for break Thursday. I was going to sit her down and tell her about my probably deadly condition. Should I still do this? I don't want it to seem like I want her to pity me... But hearing the odds of my heart failure within the next 5-10 years really made me look at my life, and I decided to keep only the things that make me truly happy in it. And she makes me happier than anything, and, as morbid as this next statement may be, I want to spend as much time with her as possible before I go.


**TL;DR, have a potentially deadly illness, not sure whether or not to tell my ex-girlfriend and the love of my life because it will seem like all I want is pity from her. I want to spend every possible moment with her. I really dislike pity, which is why I haven't told any of my friends.**

This has been a problem in the two relationships that i've been in so far. I got into those relationships because I felt an initial attraction for that person and I decide to act on those feelings. The relationship continues normally, going through the honeymoon phase to the comfortable phase where my feelings start to die down and I start to take them for granted, etc. It is around this time that my muted feelings become a problem because my SO doesn't feel like I care about them or don't put any effort into the relationship and they become unhappy. Eventually things get so bad that we end up breaking up, at which point, my feelings come to surface and I begin to miss them and start to feel bad for taking them for granted and not putting enough effort into the relationship. If we do end up getting back together, I just end up feeling the same way I did during the comfortable phase.

I don't doubt she's got pain or anything else-but-if I get sick, she will have the same thing but worse.

 She doesn't have to go to hospital all the time like me, though. She says that she cannot stand the pain but goes to the mall for 4 hours and walks around at least twice a week and every weekend, not to mention her 2 hour jaunts to Target every other day (no exaggeration). What I would give to be able to do that; but I can't-I'm not able. 

She has never visited me in the hospital; her excuse is she cannot be around all the germs. She will call and cry to me about her husband not helping her and I will listen and tell her that I am so sorry that she has to go through all that she does and her usual reply is ""you have no idea about the pain"". She never asks how I'm feeling, ever. 

I found out that I broke a piece of my shoulder off and it has to be replaced and I tried to tell her because I was pretty upset and in a shitload of pain; she told me she had to go because her mom and dad (who I know as well) were there and she would call me back. She didn't call until the next day to see if she could borrow one of my dresses for a formal dinner for her husbands job. She did not even mention my call the day before. Am I being petty? Why do I feel as though she thinks we are in a competition as to who is sicker. I'm to the point that I don't think this friendship is good for me any longer. I just feel worse when I talk to her. 

She had a baby a few years ago and said that is the 'worst pain any human can live through'. It sort of seemed like a back-handed remark but I ignored it as my own nerosis. Bone death is pretty fucking painful, though. 

I feel like she hates me sometimes. I've never had to break a friendship before and I wouldn't even know what to do or say. If anyone reads this, please tell me if I'm being the asshole by thinking of ending the friendship.

We were acquaintances for about 18 months. Any time spent together was usually with friends or just while studying. She was beautiful, funny, smart, and had an awesome personality. It didn't take long for me to end up with a huge crush on her. Everyday, I looked forward to seeing her at school. It felt so great to be around her. We had a couple classes together so I had a chance to talk to her everyday and between classes. She didn't have a boyfriend and didn't seem interested in most of the guys that tried to flirt with her. She always greeted me with a smile when I saw her. During the first summer after we met, we exchanged just little pen-pal style letters (I was out of town) and was greeted with a big hug when we met up at school following the break. That fall, her and I took a short drive after school to a school sporting event. On the way back, we got on the conversation of relationships and the rumors that she ""doesn't date."" Thats when I jokingly bought 'it' up and asked her ""well, would you date me if I asked??"" and she laughed and said ""I dont know, probably.""  
  
The rest of the ride home was pretty quiet and awkward. I dont know what was wrong with me. Im more of the introverted quiet type and I guess I had opened a door that I was too nervous to walk through. After that evening, things were pretty much back to normal between us but a week later, she just vanished from school. No nothing. No contact, no reason. The best I had heard was that it was something having to do with her parents and her having to move schools all the sudden, but that was it. I tried calling a few weeks later to make some small talk, but it felt really awkward and I didnt call again. (stupid teen brain).. That first week she was gone, I cried myself to sleep every night. People who know me as I am now would never believe I would shed a tear over anything.
  
That was 14 years ago now, and still hardly a week goes by that she doesn't cross my mind while im driving, or just day dreaming, or reflecting on my life. Sometimes it depresses me. We've exchanged maybe ten sentences in all this time. Mostly over myspace or facebook, but its all been superficial comments or 'just saying hi'  
  
How do I deal with this? Maybe having a love interest severed so abruptly from me at a young age fucked me up? I dont think Heidi knows anything at all about how she made me feel, and ive been married now for some time, so I feel like contacting her or getting any kind of closure would be opening a can of worms with my S.O. Im just stuck, and have been for a long time. Heidi still isnt married, has no children, and has not been in a solid relationship that I know of in quite a while.

As the title says, I was sexually/physically abused by my brother growing up. I try not to see or speak to him now, but my family doesn't know, and only a few of my friends do know. 

I've known this guy, M, since we were 12. We met at sleep away camp and he was the boy that had a huge crush on me at the time and I was cruelly oblivious. We reconnected through Facebook towards the end of high school, and we've kept in touch off and on since then. With feelings on both ends revolving back and forth. We're now both relatively recent college graduates, connected again and this time something just clicked and we're seeing where things could go. Unfortunately we still live in different cities, but are hopefully trying to develop something since this has been the longest time coming ever it seems. 11 years to be exact.

The big BUT: I've had this sinking feeling for the past few weeks because he has the same name as the brother who abused me. I realize a name shouldn't matter that much, but I'm worried I'll never be able to be intimate with him without thinking about the abuse. I feel like it's something I have to share with him before we have sex, and I would really love to be able to in order to feel more secure, but I'm scared that if I do I'll ruin our sex life before it even begins. 

I realize that this is something I should probably bring to a therapist, but due to insurance/financial issues right now I can't afford one. 

I guess my question is has anyone been in a similar situation with their abuse and dating someone with same name? Should I just stop pursuing this guy knowing that his name will bother me?? Any advice at all would be helpful.

Basically I just don't feel anything about other people. I don't have friends that I hang out with. Not because I am nervous about social situations... Maintaining friendships just isn't worth the effort to me. I receive the same level of stimulation from chatting with a cashier as I would hanging out with some guy I was ""friends"" with, so I don't bother.

From self-analysis I feel like I'm somewhere between autism and sociopathy. But the ""classic symptoms"" of each doesn't fit me. 

I have no trouble reading others' emotions, fitting into social situations, or attracting and keeping women as romantic partners (which is generally said to be difficult for an autistic). I have no history of violence, although I've committed other crimes I was never suspected of. I'm not an obsessive liar like most sociopaths are said to be... lying requires more effort because you have to remember everything you say. When I do lie, no one catches me, and I have no trouble keeping up a facade.

My only moral sentiment is a general contempt for weakness, both in myself and others. I feel contempt for muggers and wife-beaters because the truly masterful should not need violence to control another person... reliance on force is a sign of an inferior mind or weak impulse control. 

I don't want advice about seeing a psychiatrist, because I'd either lie to them and gain nothing or perhaps end up in trouble if I were perfectly honest. So that's out.

I wanted to be in a proper relationship with him but didn't raise the issue as his girlfriend of a year had broken up with him right before he started a friendship with me. At the time I didn't think anything of it, because I barely knew him and was just excited to meet somebody I had so much in common with (this doesn't happen often). However, after I developed feelings for him, I worred that he initiated our friendship as a way of getting over his ex, since I am quite like her. I didn't want to be 'the rebound' so figured that if he wanted to be in a relationship with me, he would ask me. 

After being close for all those months, he started telling me that he was too busy to see me, and completely withdrew. I asked him about it and he just kept feeding me the 'I'm busy' line, and I realized that I couldn't go on like this - waiting for scraps of his attention - so cut contact with him and tried to move on. I realize now that I probably was a rebound, or at least an emotional crutch, and that when he got over her, he no longer needed me. This has been a bitter pill to swallow, as I had real and deep feelings for him, but I'm glad I didn't pursue him as it would have just lead to more hurt. 

Now, the problem. This guy is objectively amazing. He is everything I aspire to be. He is motivated, incredibly intelligent, exceeding the usual expectations of a 22 year old in his particular field, and shows no sign of slowing down. He will be great one day. He has plans to change the world - detailed plans that I wouldn't be able to conjure up in a million years. His brain is amazing. But he's also very funny, nerdy in the most lovely of ways, and adorably derpy for somebody so smart. He was, in essence, my perfect guy. And he got bored with me. 

My self-esteem has taken a massive hit. He encapsulated everything my 'type' is, and he became bored with me in a matter of months. I'm scared I'll never find anybody as good as he was, and the fact that he rejected me has made be believe that I'll never be good enough. I'll never achieve what I want to achieve, because I aspire to be like him, and he rejected me. This may sound terrible, but if he was some sort of loser going nowhere with his life, this wouldn't make me anywhere near as upset. I need to gain my confidence back as I am currently undertaking the year that could make-or-break my future career. My field is so small and so competitive I can't afford to produce anything less than perfection this entire year. Yet I am struggling.

From October 2006 to November 2008 I was in a relationship with a girl whom I loved dearly, she was sweet and kind, beautiful and charming - and not in the conventional way that girls are meant to be good looking these days - i.e. all skin and bones - no she was curvy/normal and... just... I've never met anyone like her before or since. She was so cute and charming and lovely, I just felt so calm and at peace around her, I'm a very intense passionate guy and being with her was like a calm washed over me and I felt 'at peace'.

I didn't used to be 'good with girls', but after our relationship ended (due to long distance, she was at University 200 miles away and the pressures broke us) I stopped caring and lo and behold I couldn't stop finding girls... at first this was a great ego massage but then after a while I felt worse and worse, the girls weren't making me happy, they weren't helping me get over her, they were illustrating to me perfectly that she was someone truly special.

When me and A first split up we spent a few months apart, I got my life sorted, got my own place, got in to the best shape I've ever been in, and I thought I'd won her back, but she came back to tell me that she wasnt attracted to me any more and that she was thinking of seeing someone else - this transpires to be her best friend at Uni...

Years have gone by, I've had more girls then I can count, some have been lovely and fantastic to me and tried to win my heart - but I wake up in the middle of the night dreaming of A, realising that X is there instead and feel sick and I start getting anxious and before I know it I'm being a horrible person.

I'm not a horrible person, I am someone who believes in true love, I am someone who is so hurt and jaded that I have been losing my grip.

It was her birthday last Monday, I wanted to text her (how I've longed to contact her for the whole 3 years, Xmas is the worse because I know she's likely to be in town...) and I didn't because I convinced myself to wait until I get to London and then I can contact her....

I've been telling myself that me and A will get back together, that we were meant to be, that I will move to London and that we'll be together again - but this weekend I found out that A has been with her new guy, the best friend, for 3 years.

Their anniversay date is before the date she last came to visit me 3 years ago - she lied to me - and all the time I've been hurt and upset, all the times my heart hasn't allowed me to feel anything for anyone else - let alone say those three little words - she's probably told him she loves him hundreds if not thousands of times.

Words cannot describe how stupid, empty and invalidated I feel right now.

I am a strong person but today I feel weak.

Today I feel like I'll never be happy, I'll never replace her, and she replaced me without skipping a beat.

And so many girls have told me I am uncaring, that I don't  have feelings, that I am a horrible person.

Maybe I am, I don't know any more.

I feel so numb inside...

I can't tell anyone about this, my friends laugh at me because they can't understand how somoene who seemingly 'has any girl he wants' can be hung up over one 'mediocre' girl he loved once upon a time.

But I'm lost, I've been lost for years and my behaviour is getting more and more erratic, I just don't care any more, I just want to feel my heart again.

In the meantime, I'll get told by countless other girls that I'm not relationship material because I'm cold hearted and mean - if only they knew the hidden depths.

I can't let them know, I'm nearly dead inside as it is, another hammer blow will kill me.

Point of this?
I'm not a terrible person, I'm a hopeless romantic, just a hopeless romantic who has no confidence issues or problems with women at all... i don't even make sense :(

Why trust somene and open urself up when its so easy to be cold and get everything you want?

I don't know what to do any more - how long is it meant to take to get over someone?

How can I stop hurting other people? Even the girls who say they don't want anything serious end up getting hurt!

Should I just stop dating entirely until I meet someone who makes my heart skip a beat? I just don't know if I believe in that any more - the only girl whos made my heart skip a beat is a girl who is the exact spitting image of A... that can't be healthy?

And I can already tell you that I might not do the best job at describing all of this just for the simple fact that it's the single strangest thing that's ever happened to me. And even after dealing with it for so long, I'm still not much closer to figuring out what's wrong with me. But it's already been long enough as it is and I need as much help as I can from anywhere now, because I know this is no way for anyone to live.

I'm 21, and I'm a guy. It all started around the beginning of November 2010. I remember it was basically just a normal day like any other, and there wasn't a single problem in my life. About half-way through the day though something happened. (As stupid as it seems, I'm not going to say what it was, just for the fact that it was basically nothing at all, and would probably cause an entirely different discussion in itself. But please believe me when I say it was nothing personal, nothing traumatic, and  nothing with the slightest bit of importance at all. I doubt anyone else would have given it a second though, if they even thought about it at all) And when it happened, at that very *instant* and ever since then, it's like the ""me"" center of my brain has just shut down completely. It wasn't a slow downward spiral that lasted a few days, it wasn't even a fast downward spiral that lasted a few hours or minutes. If you snap your fingers right now, that's exactly how fast it happened. 

Once that happened, I lost what feels like everything to me. My interests, my own ideas and beliefs, my ambitions, and most importantly, all of my emotions. Everything that made me exactly who I was is now just... gone. There's no other way to describe it. I've tried my best almost everyday to somehow get it all back. Tried to force myself to *feel* this way, or to *want* to do this, or to *think* this way about something. But never has there ever been even the slightest sign of success. I had to stop trying so much after a while because after an hour or two, I got really bad headaches in the front of my head.

This is all terrible for many reasons. Since I don't find anything interesting, it's like I can't have fun anymore. The day before all this happened, I remember playing one of my favorite games. And like any other person, I was having a great time with it. Fast forward to the next day after this happened.  Nope. There's suddenly nothing fun about that game. It wasn't boring, and it didn't suck, but it sure as hell wasn't fun anymore. This same thing goes along with any interest I had in music, movies, tv shows, or almost any sort of activity at all. I always had the easiest time making myself feel immersed into something I really enjoyed watching, listening to, or playing, but not anymore. It's not that any of it's boring or stupid. It's just not fun, interesting, or good anymore. The one sole exception, and to be honest the one thing that I consider a beacon of hope that things might get better for me, is [this song right here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH2efAcmBQM&amp;ob=av2e) I heard the whole thing for the first time about 2 weeks ago, and I immediately became addicted to it. It was the first time I've ever been addicted to anything this bad for about a year and a half. It was a very old feeling that I almost forgot about, and realize now that I miss it. But where I've listened to it so much, I'm not as into it as I was just a week or so ago. This song is seriously the closest I've felt to being myself again but it was only while I was listening to it. I know it's not much, but it's the only thing I've had since all this started, and it feels like a lot compared to nothing.

Another thing is how I can't seem to think in the same way that I use to. In a way it's almost like I've lost my common sense too. And it's not that I don't want to, it's just like my brain *won't even allow me to.* This causes me to just make a bunch of really simple mistakes that make me look like an idiot if anyone's around, and I've become unbelievably forgetful on just about anything now. When talking with people most of the time, it's like I can't think of something I, or any other normal person, would say during certain conversations. I might be able to hold a good conversation for maybe about 30 seconds on average, but after that, it's like my brain refuses to think of anything to continue it after that time, and it becomes just a dead conversation after that.

The most terrible about this though is that I haven't felt one single emotion that felt like a ""pure"" emotion if that makes any sense. An emotion that just *happens* and gives off a sense of what makes you you. Not happiness, not sadness, not anger, hatred, joy, excitement, anticipation, loneliness, or even love. I may have felt some of these emotions in one way or another, but never in the way they should be felt. I either tried to make myself feel it, and only felt it a little (which means it's fake and shouldn't even count really), or it just didn't feel that meaningful to me, and lasted for a very short while. And since I haven't felt any true emotions since then, I've felt no meaning with anyone, or anything, which basically means I feel no meaning in life itself. And because of all this, nothing seems to be memorable to me either. It's not that I don't remember anything at *all*, it just simply doesn't seem worth remembering.

And the worst part about having no emotion is I feel absolutely *no* connection with anyone at all about anything. My mom has a pretty tough time at work 90% of the time, and when I see her for the first time during the day, she has to tell me about it. There are times when I think she takes things too close to heart, but then there are those times where I know something she went through is bad, I know I should feel some sort of compassion for her, I know I should be either sad, or mad with her. But I don't. I just don't. No matter how badly I want to, no matter how badly I try, it's never there. And because of that, I always end up clueless as to what I should say, because how can I possibly have any idea when I feel nothing at all? Back before all this happened, I know I would've felt all that, and I would've known exactly what to say,and what to do. 

It's not just compassion either. It's literally any type of connection. Hanging out with friends has become a huge challenge now. When you hang out with someone, you always do something fun. And back before, I never had a hard time having fun, even if it was something I never found particularly interesting to begin with. Half the time it was just *being* with someone else that made the day great. But now? Nope. None of that. Some of us we'll be telling stories of something that happened recently, and I can't find it to be funny, happy, sad, or whatever it's suppose to be. And because nothing seems memorable to me anymore, I usually never have any stories for anyone anymore. The few times I have had something to tell, I had to put an unbelievable amount of effort into remembering it. Now place this on top of the fact that I don't find anything fun or interesting anymore, then you basically have a really boring person to hang out with. Part of me thinks I may lose friends sometime over this.

The part that scares me the most about this is I'm afraid I won't be able to fall in love with anyone anymore. One of the main things, if not *the* main thing I've wanted in life is to just find that one person I'll fall in love with, and who will fall in love with me. To want and need someone, and to feel wanted and needed back. I was in love once and it was the most incredible experience I've had in my whole life. And I just couldn't wait for it to happen again. But if this keeps going on, it most certainly won't *ever* happen again. I may have just ruined a chance like that with someone just a few days ago. It's a long story that I won't talk about here, but I can't help but feel it was my fault things ended up the way they did, and I'm having a hard time ever seeing even a friendship happening between us now too. And I can't help but blame a lot of it on this.

This all ended up being much longer than I expected and I'm sorry if it's too long. The only thing I'm asking for is what is this? Have any of you experienced this, or heard about it, or anything? And if you have what can I possibly do to help it, if anything at all? The one thing I think of when reading all this is depression, but there's one reason I don't think it's that: I don't feel sadness. I went through a pretty bad depression for a few years that I was able to get myself out of, and I know what that feels like. And at least then I still felt other emotions too. But with this the only thing I feel is apathy. A very pessimistic apathy. So unless there's a type of depression where you don't feel anything at all, I really don't think it's that.

Any type of information you can give me will be more than appreciated. I'm feeling desperate at this point to just feel like a real person again.

Why am I a virgin? I was always a shy computer nerd type kid. I didn't really have many friends in school and I've never really known how to talk to girls. After I moved out of my parents' house I ballooned up to 400 pounds playing MMOs. Being that heavy did not help my self-confidence, let me tell you. Recently I told myself that enough was enough, and I'm currently under 300 and working my way down in the weight department.

That's all well and good but it feels like it is way too late to learn the dating game. I still have trouble talking to women, although I'm forcing myself to do it. Women don't drape themselves all over me when I go out. Let's be honest, I'm still fat and unattractive.

I don't know how to kiss. When I do find someone who is interested in me, what is she gonna think when I try to kiss her?

I've tried the dating online thing. That's actually where I've gotten all my dates because I am too much of a wuss to ask someone out in person. All the girls I met on dating websites were about twice as heavy as their profile pictures made them look. I'm not attracted to fat women (pot, kettle, yes, I'm losing weight though). Sure, curvy is fine, fat is not.

I'm not going to hire a prostitute. Why risk getting caught or getting the clap?  I also hate bars and nightclubs and the type of women who are in them.

Lest you think it's all gloom and doom for me, here are a few of my positives.  Professionally, I'm fairly successful with a stable job in the IT field, and can comfortably support myself financially.  I can talk to women professionally, in the context of work.  I have a large number of male friends now, so I am not completely socially inept.  I like to think I'm a smart guy and I'm continuously losing weight.

Years of feeling that something is not quite right in my life, and this is it.

**Breaking down**

I was sitting in a cab with a friend, on our way home from a huge celebration by a common social group at our university. He asked me if it wasn't time for me to find someone. I felt a sting in my heart, and said something about not having met any suitable girls yet. He told me that there are thousands of suitable girls. I said ""Yeah, I guess..."" and I was quiet. On the outside, I was calm. Inside, my heart and my brain were turned inside out.

When I closed the door to my apartment, I cried. And I cried yesterday, and I am crying today. That friday night, I knew the truth: I want to feel loved, but deep down inside I don't believe that it is possible. And since I don't believe in it, it won't ever happen.

Every time anybody asks me about my love life I feel like crying right on the spot. I don't, of course. I cry when I'm alone.

I get depressed at weddings, because I won't ever have one. My grandmothers ask my parents when I'm going to meet somebody. Female friends and colleagues tell me I'm a great guy. They tell me that it's a big mystery that I don't have a girlfriend. They tell me that I'm smart, funny and good-looking.

**The facade**

Some people think I'm a player, and others think I'm gay. I put up a player facade to stop the painful questions.

I have a highly respected job. My colleagues appreciate my skills and my character. I have gone from being afraid of other people to being an accomplished public speaker. I can inspire and motivate a room of students, and respected professors compliment my presentations. I have a large social circle and several very close friends.

But no matter how successful I am, there is a constant feeling that I'm not good enough. And nothing I have tried has shaken the feeling that I will be alone forever. After turning 28 a few weeks ago, I feel like I'm running out of time.

**Trying to heal**

After a spiritual awakening about a year ago, I started practicing yoga and meditation regularly. I have become aware of a constant lump in my throat, as if I'm about to cry at any given moment.

I have a therapist, and we're making some progress. I also have a professional coach at work, but I'm considering putting that on hold until I sort this out. Two very close friends know that I'm feeling like this, and a few others know parts of it.

There have been women in my life. I have been in love, but I have never been able to make a relationship work for more than a few weeks. Right now, a girl is actively pursuing me. But I can't feel *anything*. It is as if I'm blocking all feelings, afraid that they will destroy me, or her.

**Thank you for reading this.**
There is so much more to say, but this is a start. I just don't know where to go, or what to do.

In my experiences, I've only had one boyfriend and I don't prefer to count that because he had some issues (double depression) that I probably should've considered before I even got in the relationship. I'm pretty sure I went with the relationship because I didn't want to be alone.

Every other guy I've been ""involved"" with has only lasted around a month and it seems like I can only consider them flings (they were mostly fuck buddies). I also have a habit of falling into these flings with guys that I don't really consider ideal. But when I find someone I actually like (the last guy I was involved with, I actually liked), things seem like they're going well for awhile and all of a sudden, they just kind of up and go and get into a relationship with the next girl they date.

For some reason, as of late I've been feeling guilty about my gaming and the amount of time playing video games. I guess this all began when:
I was starting one of my college math classes and my teacher went on a rant to tell about how bad video games are and what a ""waste of time"" they are. She thought the idea of pro gaming to be a weird thing and was demonizing it. The next day however, she would go on and show a class where I can illegally watch movies and TV shows for free. So she hates video games but watching movies and TV shows are completely ok with her? Throughout the year she would go on YouTube to show us popular you've videos that are on at the time. However, this made me think a lot about my gaming lifestyle.

I have lately been doing research on this topic and would go to /r/NoFap and /r/StopGaming and people there seem to complain how gaming has ruined their life. They would also go on to say how much their social life has improved once they quit and got tons of friends. To me this is very difficult and I feel like I'm socializing while I'm online. I now feel like I have to be a workaholic 100% of the time and always be doing something constructive. I've lately been picking up Dungeons and Dragons and seeing if that interest me.

I always thought that I would live the same life as my mother, who never had to worry about working and who always had someone who took care of her.

I have always been a bit antisocial, nerdy and weird, so when I was younger I did not care much about my appearance and having a boyfriend since I felt that men did not like me very much and I also resented men because male relatives bullied me and I saw bad relationships in my social circles. Notwithstanding all this, I always thought that my ""future husband"" would show up somehow naturally in the right time.

So I carried on with my life, I went to college, graduate school and then I got a good job in my field. I live on my own and people would say that I am doing fine, but this is not the life I sincerely thought I would live.

A few years ago I realized that my dream life was not happening and that I was growing old, and that I had to be more proactive. So I lost some weight, improved my appearance and attitude and I tried to meet new people both in real life and in online dating sites, in order to foster a relationship, but I was very unsuccessful. I felt like I was an expired product in a meat market and I felt so worthless because none of the guys I liked would reciprocate.

Just to clarify, I never went for the alpha guys that were way out of my league, but I rather went for guys that were similar to me in age, academics, etc, and even then I was not able to sustain a meaningful relationship.

Some guys showed interest in me, but I did not really liked them, so I talked myself into liking them, so that I would not be alone, but I just felt very unhappy, so I let them go.

I know I should be more proactive, but I really think that it would be counterproductive as I would come off even more desperate than what I am right now.

What worries me beside than dying alone, is that I am becoming very resentful of married women with husbands that love them and take care of them, even though many of these women are manipulative and treat their husbands poorly.

I resent that if I were cunning I would have a husband by now, but because I do not to manipulate men, I ended up alone. I feel that I am becoming more cynical about life in general and more inclined to chronic depression.

I am not perfect, but I think that I am a decent human being and that I would make a good partner. I try not to hurt other people and I think that I am somewhat attractive, since I had received compliments on my appearance, and I even posted on r/amiugly and most people said that I was pretty.

I talked to a therapist about these issues and I have realized at a conscious level that life does not owe me a husband, and I am trying to be more positive in life, but it is hard when my efforts do not yield good results.

I would appreciate your help. Thanks.

(long read)",TotallySam,11,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1gmgwj/my_23m_parents_have_taught_me_to_be_an_overly/,"My father [49], because of the way *his* father raised him (oldest of 9 so he was constantly getting the brunt of his father's anger. He was worked days and nights and his father would drink and beat him and my uncles), has been putting me down my entire life. Nothing I ever did was good enough and all my accomplishments could have been better. When he wasn't drinking himself asleep, he was taking his stress out of me verbally, emotionally, and physically. Now, I'm overly cautious and I stress out about what other people think of me. I don't ever want to hurt, upset, or anger anyone (out of fear of feeling guilt, blame, or shame) so I just remove myself from the equation. This, in turn, has left me with a lot of regret and missed opportunities. He never took an interest into what I was doing, except for to tell me it wasn't good enough.

My mother [49], as a result of *her* upbringing (youngest of 11 so she was pampered, spoiled, and looked after), has been overprotective and sheltering me my entire life. I couldn't even go down the street to play with my friends. Both her parents dying really made it worse. Anytime I leave the house sends her into a whirl of stress and worry. If I had plans to drive out a few hours with my friends, she'd try to persuade me to either back out of the plans or suggest something closer to home. This has left me terrified of ""what's out there"" and trying new things. 

My parents have never really been financially secure with me, let alone with me and my 3 younger siblings (18M, 18M, 14F) so it was never really that easy to get the things we needed. Now, if I have it, I'm spending every dollar of money I get into contact with. My saving abilities are virtually non-existent.

I want to make music. I want to write music, I want to compose, I want to perform, I want to sing. I want to make a difference...but it's a new thing...and it's scary...and despite going to school for composing, despite taking years of classical vocal classes, and despite knowing my way around a piano...something stops me from putting anything out there....this fear....this adversity to change juxtaposed with this fear of not being good enough.

To counteract this stress and angst inside of me, I've turned my social persona into the goofball. I'm incredibly funny, I'm witty, and I'm smart as fuck. It's taken me a long time to even acknowledge those as my strengths. When I make my friends laugh, it makes me feel good about myself. It's that validation I've been seeking my entire life...but I don't want to be dependent on others for my validation.

In relationships, I've only ever accepted my Anima (The female archetype of the unconscious mind). When my dad would be at work or drinking, I would be taken care of by my mother, my aunts, my cousins, my mom's coworkers, family friends. In school, whenever I was away from my family, from Kindergarten to 6th grade, all my teachers were female. Even in high school, and college, a good 90% of my teachers were female. Anyway, that's led me to develop this identity of ""All men are assholes, and all women are amazing"" mentality. I can't approach women because WHAT IF I COME OFF AS A CREEP. I SHOULDN'T. K BYE PRETTY LADY. and in relationships, I become I MUST BE THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND. TELL ME HOW TO BE THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND ALL THE TIME WAIT WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

Out of relationships, I become very dependent on all things sexual. I become a flirt, I sext, I swap pics, I go on all the NSFW subreddits, pics and text...and it's all for that brief release and feel of being wanted.

I'm just fresh out a break-up that's left me really shaken and jarred, emotionally and mentally, which led me to seek professional advice from a therapist, so I could make sense of what I was feeling and healthily go through this grieving process. Today, in therapy, I addressed these issues very vocally and my therapist gave me some really good tools. 

Change is scary but I want it. No one's given me the tools to go about changing for the better. All I know is what *not* to be, and who *not* to become.

Details inside.,throwaway743265792,11,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1f87r7/please_help_i_m22_am_super_unreasonably_jealous/,"Hi guys. I have issues that I know are not okay. I am very aware they are not okay and I haven't voiced them to anybody but I'm just looking for some help/advice.

I am a 22 year old male who just recently got into a relationship with a 22 year old female.  The girl and I have been friends for very long (6 years) and have been walking the line between friendship and more than that for just as long. Only two months ago have we decided to start dating officially (BF/GF).

The problem here is, I am an overly jealous person. I'm not sure where this problem stems from, but I haven't told anybody about it. My girlfriend doesn't know I'm jealous of her because I haven't told her because I know this type of jealousy isn't okay.

She recently traveled far away (tropical Asia) for a long time with her girlfriends.  I know deep down inside that she would do nothing to hurt me. I am positive of that because I've known her for so long and have seen what she's like in relationships. That's not what I'm worried about. For some reason, I am just jealous of her. I am jealous that she's having tons of fun with her girlfriends without me. I am jealous that she's going on all these adventures in a foreign country that I wish I could go on with her. I am jealous that she went skinny dipping with (only) her girlfriends at 3:30 AM her time so there wasn't anybody around to see (although she probably was spotted, which also makes me jealous).  The bottom line is, I'm just jealous that she's having fun while I'm cooped up at home with nothing to do except work and go to the gym and occasionally hang out with friends. What I do pales in comparison with what she's doing right now and I can't stand it.

I know this type of jealousy isn't okay, but I can't help it. When she texts me and tells me she loves me and she would do nothing to hurt me, I believe it. And she texts me all these photos of all the fun things she does and I love that she does that because it shows that she wants to share her life with me. She tells me she doesn't talk to the local guys there because she only wants me and she misses me and I believe her.  But every time she tells me she's having all this fun, I get so jealous and resentful that it gives me a headache and a tight chest. 

I have never expressed any of this jealousy though. This is the first time she's traveling long distance and long term away from me (even during our friendship), and I have supported her the whole way. Every time she texts me photos of her at the beach and at the pool and drinking with her girlfriends, I reply wholeheartedly and tell her I'm so happy that she's having the time of her life. And I am happy that she's happy. But I still can't escape this feeling of jealousy and resentment.

Help :( I really need help :( I know it's wrong to feel like this. You should be happy that your SO is happy. And I am. But I shouldn't feel jealous and resentful also.

Lately I have felt some strong signs that he might like me back and now I'm starting to ask myself ""do I really like him?""

This is pretty usual to me and has happened the last few times that I've liked someone. It's like I'm afraid that he doesn't like the real me and as soon as he shows a sign that he's interested It's like I get scared or something. My stomach hurts, my heart starts pumping really fast and I start thinking of what things that can go wrong. Usually I never find anything particular with that person that makes me that anxious but everything just seems… wrong. yet, I really want it to feel good. I really try to. Because I know that I actually like this guy.

I'm pretty mature and feel more comfortable with people who are older than me in comparison with people my own age. I've never had a boyfriend and I've never kissed anyone. ANYONE. Not in a party, nor a game, nor when I was little and all that ""cute"" stuff you were supposed to do back then. And that is something I often refer to when I'm sitting there all alone and thinking of what to do with myself. That ""maybe I'm a bad kisser"" or ""maybe my crush is a bad kisser and my first kiss will suck ass...
It's not that I don't want to or something like that, it's just that I haven't.

So the thing I'm wondering about is, is this a thing? Like, can you call this kind of behavior something or is it not that serious. I just want to kind of know if someone else has felt like this and if you were able to get out of it. And also dating tips in general that can make me feel more comfortable and also a bit more prepared if something happens (anything).

I'm 29 and never had a relationship. Was kissed by a girl once almost 9 years ago. That was the only time anyone showed any attraction towards me.

I would love to have someone to share my life with but I don't have the faintest idea about how to get into or be in a relationship. I lack the courage to approach women, but if we're somehow introduced I can usually talk to them. I can even flirt a little. I just have no idea how to take it further. I guess there's a certain intuition for when to touch or go in for the kiss that I just completely lack. I'm so afraid to do something that she'll find uncomfortable that I won't do anything until I get written permission, and probably not even then.

That might be okay if you're half my age, but I'm afraid that now women will just expect more. And even if we do kiss, or it eventually leads to sex, or even a relationship? Obviously I'm going to completely suck at these things due to inexperience. I'm afraid she'll just take a bad kiss/sex as a sign that there is no chemistry and bolt. Or maybe if she knew the cause, she would take it as a massive red flag: ""What's more likely? That I'm wrong about being attracted to him, or literally every other woman he has ever met? There must be something wrong with him...""

And that's just one problem. I feel uncomfortable around people I don't know, lack the courage to approach them, couldn't really drive a conversation if I did and deal with rejection badly. I greatly prefer being friends first, but secretly hoping for more is a terrible basis for a friendship and will lead to catastrophe when the inevitable rejection comes. But even friends need to be met first and that's unlikely to happen because I hate going out, don't really have any hobbies and there are virtually no women in Physics where I work.

I just don't know what to do. I don't even know what you guys could say to help. Maybe some advice? I just don't want to spend my life alone and I feel it's getting more likely every day due to the age thing.

For a great many reasons. I've tried to make a list of those. I hope it's alright.

I : 
- Greatly lack empathy ;
- Am self-centered ;
- Am very shy and anxious around strangers ;
- Am weird ;
- Am always scared of investing emotions anywhere, and thus I ;
- Have repressed emotions that make me look almost completely emotionless ;
- Live in my own little world that is hard for people to penetrate ;
- Look very cold and haughty and judgmental and harsch ;
- Keep failing at creating and maintaining (normal) relationships with people ; 
- Create, half-unwillingly, a distance between me and others ; 
- Am very spammy, and so can annoy people because of my verbosity ;
- Likewise, I can be very clingy ;
- Linked to my clinginess is my feelings of insecurity and lack of self-confidence ;
- Am bad at having normal conversations ;
- Want to discover others, but don't feel any natural curiosity towards them (but I wish I did)  ; 
- Haven't cried in years, I keep repressing it ; 
- Have a hard time just saying what I want / feel / need to people ;
- Hardly dare to have any sort of casual interactions with people ;
- Am very introverted in general ;
- Am extremely vulnerable to being made fun of.

That's all the things I can list off the top of my head. Now, I'll give an example of my issues, and that example is my most bitter failure to date.

Last year I met, on the internet, a young lady just barely older than I, who lived in Durand, Michigan. She was a lively, quirky artist girl who was very compassionate, had many friends that she always supported, was adorable in every way, and was very geeky. 

We got along immediately, and very well so. She was my ally, the one person who would always say I was great when I felt rotten, who would see value in me like nobody else ever had, who was funny and interesting and cheerful, who liked me honestly, and all that. 

I think I had managed to be in a fair friendship where nobody was overbearing, and where nobody was unfairly treated. I think that I really was good with her and her with me. 

Then she started popping up much less often. Then she stopped popping up entirely on Skype, so I signed up on Facebook to try to reach her. When I finally did, she told me she was busy, and all sorts of things, said reassuring words to me, and all seemed well. Then I confessed. Then I would often send messages, that weren't obsessional yet...And she wouldn't answer. Then I started sending a lot more. Still no answer. Then, I guess I went crazy from missing the person most precious to me ever. So I sent hundreds of messages that run along the whole spectrum of human emotions, with fury, grief, normalcy, happiness, insanity, etc etc. 

After 700+ messages, most of which were insane and desperate blabbering, the only answer I had gotten was ""Talk to her"". That was literally all I got. Then she disappeared from Facebook. Then she unfriended me on Skype. All of this with not a word written to me. Not one explanation, or one order to stop. Just nothing. That's what had driven me mad in the first place. 

I guess I were wrong. But I think, so was she, who turned my back on me without even confronting the one person she had treated like a real friend. 

I guess I've missed a lot of details, but the essential is here. To this day, I feel much duller and darker than I was before she started ignoring me completely.

Also, it's not the first time I'm thus ignored. 

I'm really sorry for this wall of text, but I had lots of things to say and I haven't even said half of the whole. If I did anything wrong, by all means correct me.

We don't own anything except computers and a car. We rent. We pay monthly and we have no troubles paying it off. But this is where it stops. Our savings are very slim, simply because we earn enough money to live comfortably month-to-month.

My salary is ok, nothing spectacular, but if I compare it to some of my friends' salary, I'm broke. The fact that I know a lot of friends who managed to situate themselves one way or another, by inheriting a place to live (hence no paying for the damn rent) I find myself in a pretty sad situation. 

I can tap myself on the back about ""not being in debt"" all I want, but the fact that I'm not involved in any kind of debt only sounds good, the reality tells me I'm broke.

Sometimes I feel that I'm trying to hard to go against the grain, and the voices of ""give it up and do like others do"" are louder and louder in my head. I should get my girlfriend prego and I should get a loan of some kind and rot away my life running in place.

Some people around me keep telling me how families will definitely chip in with some ""good luck"" money if we get married. Her part of the family is constantly putting pressure on our marriage question. I can't stand it. I felt strong resentment to the idea of marriage, now I feel I'm breaking down, almost feeling totally indifferent about it and I just want to go through with it to get it over with.

The part about getting some startup ""here ya go kids"" money from families after we get married is also stupid, almost seems like a damn ransom.

Hey you two schmucks, you live on your own? You have a hard time getting by? Well - get married and we'll give you some money!

Things were set, and then a few months before we were supposed to go, he panicked, and decided not to come. Instead of staying in the town we grew up in, he moved to the other side of the States. Not only did I have no say in this, he made his decision without even talking about it with me.

We didn't want to break up, so we've been doing long distance for about 8 months now. 

Everytime he says he misses me, I just have a hard time believing him. I always think, if you miss me so much, why aren't you with me? If you love me so much, why aren't you with me?

My dad is a party animal that's been divorced twice and has had a date with a different woman for every night of the week since I've known him as an adult (basically since I started dating at 20). My mother, who raised me, was a nervous wreck and was basically single throughout my entire upbringing. She really treated me like a black sheep because I reacted poorly as a teenager (crime) - I was shipped to another continent when I was 16 to live with relatives because my life was in shambles.

I dated fairly frequently between the ages of 20-24 after slowly working my way back into life from my solitude. I dated all kinds of women from crazy 30 year old playboy models to athletic butch types to dainty short fat girls to confident BBW with 4 kids while they were still living with their husbands to nerdy MMO girls to circus performers that speak klingon to you name it.  I honestly have no idea how I got to this point in my life or how my experiences have shaped me, but I met my current girlfriend after screwing up with a very nice woman(probably the closest thing to a match that I had found yet) through my own stupidity and ignorance. We broke up once, during which time I slept with my ex (the one who I screwed over), then got back together. To be honest, that was the reason we broke up even though I knew that it wasn't going to be a permanent thing.

I've never told her about my encounter, and I've been faithful to her since we've been together. Although I have created an online dating profile and looked to see what was out there a few times. But now she wants to get married. We have a house together, and we're thinking of kids. Problem is, I don't know. I have feelings of guilt, ignorance, and I question whether we're meant for each other. I sometimes wonder if I stay with her because I literally have no idea. But since we've been together, I've generally been unhappy. She is great, and sometimes she really surprises me - and after so long, the feeling of not having her hurts.. But there has never been but a dimlit candle between us. No spark, just a small flame. I love her as a person but she doesn't stimulate me on a high level and I've got a sexual preference that others have willingly and happily catered to, yet after 5 years I have moved her 5 meters closer to when she's been 100 meters away.

My biggest fear is being a bad person and treating others badly. But I've been a bad person and I feel like I'm lost. Over time, it seems like the reasons that I could just pick up and leave my current girlfriend have shrank. I don't know if I feel trapped or if I feel like I'm just thinking the grass is always greener on the other side. But I'm at a point now where I feel like even if she or I cheated on each other, we'd probably work it out. I also feel like I need to marry her and have kids if that's what I'm gonna do, we're both 30 and it's time. But I honestly have very few memories that stick out in our time together. I have more memories of the age of 23 than I do in the 5-6 years we've been together. We don't do much, she's a homebody. I've become accustomed to a sedentary lifestyle and barely have any friends anymore. I feel like I've given up on life, but I'm keeping her happy. I'm kinda happy sometimes but I don't have any excitement in my life and I feel like I'm just kinda stuck. There's a lot going on for me.. My job (after going to college for it) isn't turning out to be something I'm actually good at. I feel like I need to go work at some brain-dead job and just start back at square 1.

We live together, she cooks for me every day and sex is awesome.  

When we first started dating, our first big fight was because she found pics of my exes in my phone and camera, and she got **extremely** upset about it.  I told her that if it meant so much to her, I would delete it because I didn't even know those pics were still there and would not care if I can't see them again anyway.  So they're gone.

When we go out, she would notice me glancing at other women and get really mad.  I told her I would stop, but it's more difficult than I thought it would be, since all my life I've been taking peeks at the hot women around me.  Sometimes a girl walks in with cleavage showing or have really nice legs, I can't help but take a peek!  I don't talk to them, and have no interest in them because honestly my girlfriend is more attractive than most of these random women.  I tried denying it, but she is absolutely sure that I was checking out other women... and it's true.  

Also when we're watching TV or movies, she always talks badly about the actresses and points out all their flaws.  I am pretty much forced to agree with her or else we would get into another argument.  Whenever the topic of celebrities comes up, she would mention how much make-up or plastic surgery was involved in creating the illusion of their beauty. 

I also sometimes look at porn and masturbate to it.  She doesn't really know about this because I do it secretly.  

What should I do?

I don't know if this has anything to do with my issue at all, but I thought I should mention it anyway.

The thing is that I'm a girl that's always around members of the opposite sex. Pretty much all my friends are male, there are only a few girls I associate with from time to time. It's not like I dislike my fellow females, I just always seem to end up with male friends. They often turn out to like me romantically, but I rarely ever feel the same way about them.

So what's the deal? I always feel like every guy I get close to has to like me romantically. I tell myself that they do, and most of the time they... well, they do just that. The last three years there has been no guy I was slightly interested in (or really interested in) that I didn't win over in one way or another. Also the guys that I would never consider dating- I want them to like me. As soon as they tell me they like me, I feel like I've won or earned something. I'm not heartless or anything, I do also like them as people, but just not romantically. That's why I feel like I'm being a real b*tch for actually wanting them to have feelings for me.

For example, there's this classmate of mine I'm kind of close with (we text each other, hang out occasionally). It's not like I have any romantic feelings towards him, but I feel jealous/pissed off when I see him talk to other girls or hear other people talk about girls he might like. He sometimes flirts with me and bothered to go shopping with me today, and I feel like I have to win him over or I won't be satisfied. I can't deal with any type of rejection and I don't know why. I feel bad when I have to reject people, but I feel terrible when they seem to reject me. As long as I barely know them, I don't give a damn, but when I do... I just can't swallow it.

The reason I'm asking this question is because I wanted to know if any of you experience the same thing, or if it's really just me. If so, what can I do about it?

I have had a diagnoses of ADHD (hyperactivity/impulsiveness/sensory issues/attention issues/emotional sensitivity) before I developed any anxiety/depression. I have gone to a few hospitals after breaking down and had been given diagnoses of major depression. Those doctors briefly saw me and just asked me a basic checklist of questions, but I do not disagree with having depression.
     
I obviously have anxiety issues which are so severe that I isolate myself because I feel uncomfortable /emotionally unavailable around people. In social situations with trusted friends I am much more 'in the present'. I feel like I float off to space whenever I am in public for too long or around people I do not know well. Being around groups of people is painful because I cannot follow the conversations, I withdraw, and I feel quite tired. It is painful to make eye contact with strangers whenever I am stressed, however, it's not usually a problem on good days, or if I am with friends

The following are negative experiences that recall having made dramatic impacts on me:

**Age 5 or 6**
 I had 4 cousins and an aunt that I spent almost every day with. My mother sought out her birth father and was ostracized by her mother's side of the family, leaving us on our own.

**Ages 1-10**
 I was very hyperactive/impulsive which made finding friends who could tolerate me very difficult . I had made close friends here and there, but I moved around quite a bit frequently losing touch.
I was not medicated until middle school which caused my ability to make friends, win the approval of teachers, or thrive virtually impossible. I was in trouble quite a bit, and I felt bullied by not only my classmates, but my teachers as well.

I was in the scouts which I hated since isn't exactly geared towards individuality. My achievements were dismissed, my peers either ignored or ridiculed me for my idiosyncrasies, and the adults were just as bad as their children.

My mother was a single parent who struggled with depression, going to college, and was generally scatterbrained. I felt really neglected even though her heart was there. I resent pretty much everything about my childhood and avoid speaking to my mother because I associate her with the shit I have been though. She is also kind of dumb.

**Age 6 or7**
Thrown into pool by my mothers boyfriend, ""so I could learn how to swim."" I sank instead of swimming.

**Age 8ish**
 While I was in a different boyscout troop, some kid blew me. I am sure that didn't fuck me up one bit (sarcasm). I don't think it really affected my sexual orientation since I was somewhat attracted to boys, but not sexually at that point.

**Age 9 or 10**
 Anger issues/oppositional defiance - Everyone and every experience really broke me. No one really understood me, but I really did not understand the extent of my issues. I was sent to a therapists, however, I had major trust issues; therapy went nowhere constructive.

**Ages 9 - 12**
My mother started dating my school counselor. I feel like it was messed up that he and my mother even dated, but things got emotionally heated as their relationship progressed. My mother eventually got pregnant, they fought, we moved in together, and shouting matches were frequent between everyone. My stepfather force fed me his paxil during this period.

**Ages 9 - 15**
Parents fought relationship was complete shit. The disregard he had for us was mind-boggling. He saw us as objects (and often as obstacles), he used like he would cheap shoes. He treated us badly while thinking he was a good provider. He abused us emotionally yet was too cunning to do so in front of witnesses. He was only nice to other people or did things for them for the self-aggrandizement. And he was convinced he was a paragon of virtue and an upstanding father. He was an ex-con, ex-alcoholic, chain smoking, neglectful dick with anger issues. He hit me once during a roadtrip to see his trashy family in Amarillo, and I hit back. He took me to the sheriff of Bumfuck, Texas who preceded to tell me I had no right to hit back, and that he beats his own son whenever he is 'out of line'.

My mother slept often because she was constantly depressed and unhappy. My stepfather was a selfish bully. I took care of my sister because they obviously could not.

**Ages 11 - 13**
 Life fucking sucked because puberty, my untreated issues, friends that I lost when I moved again, and the lack of stability in my life. I constantly planned to runaway, fantasized about destroying my stepfathers car and house, wished that my stepfather would die, believed I must have been adopted by my mother, had no one I felt I could talk to about my life, and was unable to really put into words what I was going through. I turned into a depressed, reclusive zombie for years because I felt isolated for so long.

Had friends from church that weren't really interested in being friends.

**Age 14**
 My grandfather died in hospice. I regretted that I had not been able to talk to him more or express how much I appreciated him. I had totally irrational thoughts that it was my fault that he died/if I would have been better he would still be around. The guy died of ALS which is a degenerative disease; it was painful to see such a proud man die a slow and dignified death.

**Age 16 - 17**
 Became a foreign exchange student and predictably floundered due to immaturity, my inability to focus, impulsiveness, lack of communication, social failings, social anxieties, lack of money to support myself (my parents were supposed to send me money each month), and eventual decline into depression. I had friends that I spent a ton of time with. I think a lot of my idiosyncrasies were written off as being from a different culture. I became an alcoholic to cope with the stress. It was shitty, so I stopped using it as a form of escapism once I came back to the states. Oh towards the end of my foreign exchange I learned that my parents were getting a divorce, and our house would be lost.

**Age 17**
 My mother struggled to get by, and I decided to get my GED and fuck off. I considered it an adventure, so I invited a friend from Minnesota to travel with me. Davey was a punk who hitchhiked with me. He eventually got into heroin once I left for California. The last time I spoke to him he told me he did heroin 14 times in the course of a month. I lost touch with him and assume that he died. I blame myself since he only started doing drugs after I left him to his own devices.

**Age 17-19**
 This time period is a blur. I have done sex work, was kind of sexually assaulted and I feared for my life, I was in a really unstable relationship with someone who supposedly has borderline personality disorder, I dated a few people who were terrible influences, got dragged into a lot of drama, and I struggled to get by. I dropped out of college because I felt a massive amount of anxiety around other people.

I pretty much got dragged along with crazy friends while they followed their schemes, addictions, and petty desires.

Cut and abused myself. Frequently tried to overdose on pills. Have never received proper treatment from a single hospital or psycheward no matter how much I pleaded for therapy. Anti-psychotics gave me shakes, anti-depressants (zoloft, prozac, trazadone, wellbutrin, celexa) had been ineffective; one caused muscle spasms and giddiness . I was prescribed xanax, however, I don't think it was appropriate for long term use.

**Age 18**
Jokingly offered a homeless meth addict $100 to jump off the Santa Monica pier. I originally offered him $50, which he though over, then $100. He declined the extra $50, stripped, climbed over the wooden fencing, and before letting go said, ""I am prone to hypothermia, keep an eye on my stuff."" My friends and I ran before he hit the water.
I feel disgusted with myself, sad, and in need of closure for this.

**Age 19**
Was feeling lonely, so I went to an Occupy camp to find like minded people. I found some 'rainbow kids' and was invited to travel with them. I was uncomfortable once we left my city and isolated myself. Since I was not eating or sleeping enough, my cognitive functions suffered. I was constantly dehydrated, felt horribly alone, and a social outcast while at an informal camp of hundreds of travelers.

**Age 19-20** 
Currently isolating myself from the world because I am scared of socializing with people. I have no idea how to be comfortable in social situations unless I am in a comfortable environment with people I trust.

It's incredibly hard to fake being anything but a neurotic mess. I'm deadpan, sad looking, anxious, and constantly looking around even if I need to focus. Getting a job seems impossible since everything is customer service oriented and requires cheerful, energetic, extroverts.
I have a shell that is impossible to break out of unless I have spent a considerable amount of time with someone.

I believe the issues I have with ANXIETY and DEPRESSION developed as byproducts of my ADHD. These issues exasperate symptoms of my ADHD, but that does not mean it should go untreated. I have spent countless sessions with psychiatrists that refuse to consider I have anything other than depression because ADHD isn't a real disorder or it's all due to depression. I have had ADHD issues for life (diagnosed as a child and reevaluated around 10) where as everything else developed over time.
 
**TL;DR**

 I am lonely and want to be around people, but social situations are usually too painful.  I feel bored and tired most of the time, however, if I am making an effort in an uncomfortable situation I feel horribly anxious.


 I am obviously inferior and I am ashamed. I can't be who I want to become because I am unable to string a coherent original thought together that anyone would want to hear. I have somehow muzzled myself, but it is probably for the best. I have maybe 5 fully functional days a month.


 I know that being unable to work on something that I don't find absolutely fascinating for more than 5 minutes is not a normal mode of operation. I multitask (ineffectively) ruthlessly while not taking any ADHD meds.


 I was a hyperactive child and was diagnosed with ADHD w/ hyperactivity , but as I have grown I think I have muzzled my hyperactive tendencies for the most part.


 I dwell on failed social interactions, which HAS caused me to anticipate failure from future attempts. By avoiding socialization, I seem shy or introverted. It's like I've been conditioned to anticipate ridicule for expressing myself (regardless of how irrational I know I'm being). I guess a ton of these growing up can create a Pavlovian response. My impulsiveness made me unpopular which resulted in bullying to a damaging degree. My social phobia prevents me from being myself around people I don't trust.

Some of my Random Traits

	* I'm impatient when I cross roads.
	* I spend impulsively.
	* I say impulsive often hurtful things. Many friendships are put on the edge because of it.
	* I argue and get stuck in my own thinking. I think everyone would just agree with me. I can't empathise as well I'm usually capable of.
	* My many thoughts at once, layered over each other can feel painful.
	* I become anxious and depressed.
	* I forget things.
	* I hyper focus for hours.
	* I can barely settle down to read, watch TV or listen to a conversation.
	* I become bored with anything within minutes, move on and become bored again.
	* I do reckless impulsive things, that can put me in danger.
	* I get easily angry, have outbursts.  Blame everyone/thing that isn't me.
	* I get frustrated when people don't seem to understand me.
	* My speech is jumbled.
	* I bang, burn, cut myself for acting too quickly.
	* People give me that look as if what I said was stupid.
	* I CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE I'M THINKING, ALWAYS THINKING.

I am currently living with my mum who is very clingy and quite frankly driving me insane. Nothing I ever do is good enough for her it seems and anything that goes wrong with her day gets taken out on me. I am a good student, very involved in sports, enjoy gaming in my down time and don't have many friends. I get told to ""Get a life"" in a hateful tone on a regular basis (once a fortnight or so it slips in).

So basically I've had enough and want to move in with my dad who lives about 5 minutes away. He's fine with it and the arrangements have been made. But my mum tries to guilt me into staying by bringing things up like ""Well I might have to get rid of the dog if you leave"", ""I might have to sell the house if you leave"", I don't know if my relationship can work if you leave"" etc.

But I can't take it here anymore and I am starting University this year (in a few weeks) and I know that staying here will affect my study time and just my general sanity.

I just can't get past that worthless feeling- I don't even know if therapy is helping. 

So, in the past few months I realized I have major problems. History of suicidal thoughts, a bunch of abusive relationships, blah blah blah.

I've been going to therapy, and maybe it's helping. I don't know. I've seen two therapists now, and both say the same thing: I need to be alone and happy before I can be happy in a relationship. So I've been single for a long time, some months. It kind of worked, I was happy for a bit. But now I'm in that place again where I have that desperate need for a boyfriend coming out. It's weird. A boyfriend never made me happy either.  

Anyway, supposedly I'm all damaged and shit because my dad was a serial cheater who left us a bunch of times and my mom is fairly fucked up in a bunch of ways. I didn't buy the whole family affects your relationships thing, but I'm starting to see it now. I've only ever fallen for guys who are serial cheaters anyway, so it's the whole dad connection thing. 

With the most recent guy, I knew he was a serial cheater, he's cheated on a bunch of his girlfriends and thinks it's ok because they didn't find out. I thought that was shitty of him. And at the same time, it's what drew me in, because I wanted to be the girl who changed him. And I feel worthless because I wasn't that girl. What I really hate. There are no words to describe how useless I feel because he didn't want me. And now I think he has some girlfriend (?) and I feel like he won't cheat on her. And why wasn't I the girl who got through to him. Why wasn't I enough, you know. I'm never enough. And it feels awful. And I said that to the therapists: I just want to know that it wasn't me. I want to know that no one could change him, that it's his problem and not mine. And they can't tell me that, because sometimes love does change people. Just not mine. 

Because I'm doing all that stuff someone is supposed to do. I have a great job. How many 23 year olds can say they make 30 bucks an hour, and enjoy what they do. I've travelled the world. I'm learning another language. I exercise. I eat right. I have a great group of friends. And knowing this guy got with someone else, that just took it all away. I just feel like the same useless piece of shit I always was. I even did that whole write a list of things you like about yourself. But what does list matter when he doesn't see anything good in me. 

And I've tried so hard with this therapy and all that. I just want to know that I'm fighting for something and I'll win. Eventually. Some how. Because right now it all just feels awful. 

Has anyone been in a place like this and come out ok. Because I'm not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel right now. It'd just be so much easier to just go back to the way I was. I asked when I'd be ok to have a relationship again, they said when I don't need one. I asked if I'd be able to kick the attraction to douchebags, they said maybe, but I'd probably be attracted to them for a long time.

Everybody has their own room, but everyone is paired up in a living space sharing a bathroom and kitchenette.  

This morning, my next door neighbor came pounding on my door exclaiming that his roommate is dead.  He found him face down in the bathtub, full of water.  He was super drunk last night, absolutely tore up, and my neighbor isn't sure if it was a suicide, or if he was just so drunk he didn't know what was going on.  People who know him have never seen any suicidal tendencies.  

I helped my neighbor get a hold of an ambulance and the police.  Everything has been taken care of by this point, cops, ambulance, firetrucks, the whole 9 yards.  I've already given my statement, all that jazz.  But none of this is why I am posting on here.

**You see, none of it really bothers me.**  The kid killed himself.  Sucks to be him, he should have made better decisions.  I'll be honest with you though, right now, I'm not perfect.  I'm not going about my day as if nothing happened.  I'm a little shook up about it.  But, I'm not shook up because the guy died.  I'm shook up, because I feel like I'm supposed to be shook up.  Like, everyone else around me is freaking out, I guess I should put on some sort of act like I feel remorse.

Is that really a problem, that I don't find death of an acquaintance very shaking?  Everyone keeps asking me if I'm alright.  Like, my neighbor, who actually found his roommate dead in the bathroom, yeah, I can see him being shook up, all the right to him.  But I mean, me?  All I partook in this is calling the proper authorities.  One person died at an early age.  Not the first, wont be the last.  Its just nature.  And I feel like I have to tell people that yeah, its real fucked up, but I'll be alright, but in all reality, I don't even care.

I know logically that the guys I encounter in my life now have nothing to do with the guys that made fun of me.

I figured out what it was. These people had been friends since they were young. most of them when they started high school, some before that. i was ""the new guy"" i had no history with these people, but that just made it harder for me to fit in with them, soon i became kinda detached towards them, stopped caring about what they did as i tried to be their friends earlier, and somehow it went nowhere. 

This year has been my final year, i've made a few really good *friends*  but nothing compared to oen fo those close friends that know the world about you, just people i get along with.
I've heard form people that people tend to find me weird, or annoying, i get that, i talk a lot, but i dont mean to annoy, i just enjoy conversing.

I've never had a girlfriend either, i've come pretty close, but not quite. 
A friend that i met online was there for me through most of 2011, they soon became one fo the only people i really talked to, we got along like a match made in heaven, but, soon she fell for a guy who lived int he same city as her, i met her for one day when she was on a holiday and i traveled to that city to meet her. it was pretty emotional, and then i saw her again when i decided that i would come and see her and i soon caught a plane to her city and stayed with her for 8 days, he boyfriend hated me for being close with her and he actually just went to japan while i was with her, *Japan*, just on a whim, that how much this guy hated me. anyway, so, in order to get their relationship back on track we agreed that i wouldn't talk to her for a month, fair deal, make it through the month, we'll tak after February. figured it would be all okay. first day of mach. nothing. no phone call. no friend requests on anything. nothing. havent heard from her since. 

THat was a pretty emotional blow to me, i had lost the only person who ever really new me and one of the only people i would have ever considered myself to ever be in a relationship with. so for a long time i really didin't have anyone to talk to about anything. i started to regress more, looking for someone to fill that space, someone to just be there. a friend. anything.

As this year progressed, i felt myself being pushed out of the friend groups that i once felt comfortable with being around. there was the organisation for schools (the two weke party that happens after exams) where not a single person asked me if i wanted to join them, there was a massive group of about 14 people that i hand out with, who rented two houses to stay in. they went around and asked for payments, and who they would be staying with and they just skipped me, didn't even consider me to be a possibility. even my only proper guy friend is going. he hardly even hangs out with them.

Then the 18'th started happening, every weekend someone was turning 18, there would be groups made on facebook (i never saw them as i never got invites) and then the pictures would flood the next morning and then the week would be filled with stories. i was invited to one though. i went. it was okay, there was a lot of emotional people there. wasn't a great experience. and since then i still havent received a single invitation to anything.

When my birthday came around. it was just me and by best guy friend getting drunk and playing videogames (a pretty big passion of mine, i fell i shoudl have mentioned that somewhere but here is fine)

At this point i felt like i was catching on, i got it, they didn't like me around. i still dont know if i've done anything massively wrong, but most people dismiss anything i say in classes now, my opinion doesn't count for jack in that environment so i dont even talk anymore. 

as i said earlier, i've been trying to find someone to fill in the space, and i thought i finally had. a had a girl over last night, and i genuinely enjoy her company, i've never even had a female in my bed up to this point, so theres another great leap happening. i thought that, maybe if i had someone, the lack of other people in my life would be less significant. i would be content if i had someone love me. and actually care about my existence. so last night i tell her that i liked her. We're still friends. i'm okay with that i guess, it wasn't awkward and she's still a closer friend than i've had in a long while. but it feels as if (from my perspective) she's just regressed into another friend that wont stick out of the crowd. there if i need them but ultimately i'm not on their priority list of people. 

I only have two weeks of actual classes before exams. then it's a month to go, after that truly mortifies me. the thought of having no one want to catch up with me, no one to force me out of my house aside from a job that i'll hopefully have. a best guy friend that is so busy that he hardly has time to even talk to me as it is and no one that really put being around me as an option on their to do list. i'm scared that when i leave school, i'm just going to regress into a lonely forgotten person. i'm scared i'm going to lose contact with the outside world. 

I think i just needed to vent that. i'm not sure what i should do, or what my next steps are. any advice form anyone would just be that much more helpful. sorry for the 6000 word essay.

Tl;Dr i'm scared that after school i'm going to lose all social aspects of my life due to previous experiences with people due to being outcasted by peers and being disliked.

She seems to really enjoy my company in particular and invites me along to a lot of events and nights out, and I'm confounded as to why.

Next to her lively and fun-loving personality, I can't help but see myself as boring/no fun/uninteresting.

I ask very seriously, what the hell is going on? I don't see how I can command so much attention and appreciation from someone so fun and lively by simply being there.

Isn't it better to be *fun* to be around? To be appealing instead of just bland/agreeable and socially malleable? I rarely do more than blend in, so what is it about me she's so drawn to?

I don't think there's a right way to present all of this to you, so I'm just going to go off and write what comes to mind as I feel it.  This is going to be very long, but I really have no idea how else to really give incite into my mind.  My only hope is that I can make some kind of sense so that perhaps someone out there can relate or at the very least offer some sort of guidance.  That and I hope my TL;DR is an accurate summation.

First, the obligatory information.  I'm a 24 year old male living in Florida.  I'm currently in law school and, after having spent the last decade not having a clue what I want to do when I grow up, I think I finally have an idea.

But I won't bore you with those details.  My issue is this:  I don't think I can get over my ex girlfriend and I have no fucking idea why.

**The Backstory**

The infamous woman was my first serious girlfriend (let's call her Erin).  She moved in down the street from me back in the 7th Grade and, for some fucked up family reasons, her cousin also lived with her.  Her cousin (let's call him Mike) and I became best friends and hung out basically every day until he moved away right before freshman year started.  In those short years with Mike, we did everything typical preteen guys would do, including terrorizing Erin and her friends.  Oddly enough, Erin and I developed an attraction to each other over those years and, after Mike moved away and we both conveniently found ourselves single, we started dating.  This was the end of freshman year.

High school went by pretty unremarkably, with me being the stereotypical All-American boy, getting a football scholarship while my girlfriend cheered from the bleachers.  We were the beautiful couple that had developed out of a childhood friendship.  We were voted class couple.  Then graduation came.

Now up until this point, Erin and I had not had sex.  Hell, we only just engaged in oral play that senior year.  So we were both very much virgins.  But, we had one of those agreements where we dreamed of the day where we would both take each others innocence in some amazing session of love making (oh yea, we said we loved each other since 6 months into the relationship).  But with the looming transition to college where we would be a mere 2 hours apart from each other, unbeknownst to me, Erin started to freak out.

The night of graduation, Erin told me that she was going to a different grad party and that she didn't want me to come with her.  Fine, we hung out a lot the past week so the time apart would be good for us.  I didn't think anything of it.  And then the following night when I smoked for the first time and, coupled in with the alcohol I just drank for the first time, I was wasted.  On my trek home I stumble upon Erin having a sleepover with her best friend in a tent (totally legit, they've done it before), but with the addition of two dudes.  Whatever, I trust my woman.  I get my fucked up ass to bed and then I wake up 2 hours later to a crying Erin calling me saying she just made out with one of the bastards in the tent.

Now that's all she did was make out, but let me tell you.  It fucking destroyed me.  I'm not one to cry, I mean I was as stereotypical as it comes in regards to being a football player without emotions and whatnot, but Reddit, damn did I bawl my eyes out at this.  After the 3 years of what felt like complete and utter love for each other, she did that shit.  And then, we ""took a break"" where she would basically go out and hang out with this guy or whatever and then call me when she got home.  ""You're the guy I come home to,"" she said.  I went along with it for a month because I had invested so much emotionally in her even to the extent of alienating my friends, so I really didn't have a choice.  Eventually, however, I got sick of it and basically told her to burn in hell.  She cried, I felt good, until we got back together 2 weeks before I went off to college.

Then we had sex and took each other's virginities.  And then we fucked again.  A lot.  Then I went off to training camp and she came and visited me.  And we had more sex.

Then the tables turned and I cheated on her.  It was orientation weekend and Erin was being what I perceived as bitchy in my drunken state, so I ended up nailing a woman (out of spite) like everyone else on the team wanted to do.  To this day I am horrified at my behavior that night.  And then the next morning I called Erin and told her about it.  We broke up for a week.

We then dated tumultuously until the end of sophomore year, having sex at least 3 times a day whenever we got a day together and recklessly throwing the love word around.

And then, I got sick of the fighting, so I ended it the day sophomore year ended.

**The Problem Emerges**

The upcoming junior year and subsequent senior year were ones wrought with an early 21st birthday and lots of drunken hookups.  The problem?  I couldn't fucking get hard for any of them.

I tried being sober.  I tried taking pills.  Hell I tried doing the anti-solution and ripping shots of whiskey.  But to no avail.  I couldn't stay hard long enough to have any sort of meaningful intercourse.  And from what I can recall, I wasn't nervous at all.

On the bright side, I got damn good at oral sex let me tell you.

But the problem goes beyond sexual dysfunction.  I couldn't let anyone get close.  There are three chances that stick out in my mind as completely blown opportunities where I'm 99.7% sure I would have been incredibly happy with any of those women.  But, for whatever reason, I avoided trying to get close to them, even to the extent I turned down what amounted to free sex.

I couldn't get Erin out of my mind.  I only wanted to fuck Erin.  When I masturbated, all I could think about was experiences with Erin.  I'd watch porn and then jerk off to Erin.  ERIN ERIN ERIN ERIN ERIN ERIN ERIN.

**How this is still fucking me**

I'm currently in a relationship that is going on 6 months.  My girlfriend is absolutely brilliant and she makes a conscious effort every day to be the best girlfriend she can be.  I'm truly the luckiest guy around.

Is it because Erin took my V-Card years ago?  Or is there something else going on here?

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, let me know if it is and I'll move it.

So anyway, about a year ago I was depressed and had some issues with myself. I was in a relationship where I just wasn't happy and I started cutting as a way to get attention from my (now) ex boyfriend. I thought the cuts were superficial but I was wrong. I now have scars on my wrists, and a LOT of scars on my right leg. That relationship ended with both of us attempting suicide and ending up in the hospital (it was a toxic situation).

Since then, I have gone to therapy, cut ties with the ex, and am now completely happy and content. There is 0% chance that I will ever cut again or attempt an overdose. Honestly, I was using those two things to get attention, and I realize how messed up that is now.

Okay, so the point is: about a month ago I started dating someone new. He is amazing, and adorable, and overall very ""normal."" (His personality is completely geeky/quirky, but what I mean is, I don't think he has ever felt depression or had severe drama/issues in his life). We are long-distance, and he has not seen my scars. I am also working on getting rid of them with fade creams and such but it has not completely worked...

My question is, how much should I tell my boyfriend, and when? How honest should I be about my past? I did tell him once that my ex and I broke up in a traumatic way, but didn't say details. I don't want to push him away or make him think he's ""sticking his dick in crazy,"" because I would never do those things to myself again.

TL;DR: I cut my legs/wrists two or three times about a year ago for attention from my ex, and also overdosed on sleeping pills at the end of the relationship. I realize now (and for the past 8 or so months) that I was being crazy. Would never do anything again. Not sure how to deal with my baggage in my new relationship.

MILD UPDATE: Not that anyone is still looking at this (probably) but I just wanted to let y'all know I decided to wait awhile before telling him until I feel more comfortable about the whole thing.

Not physical attack and I don't have the feeling that everyone in the world is purposely out to get me.

The best way I can think to describe how I'm feeling is to liken it to being a small child on a crowded sidewalk in NYC during rush hour. People are pushing and shoving me out of their way, giving me disapproving looks and shouting at me. I feel trapped. Everything I do is wrong. I am wrong. I shouldn't be here. It just makes me want to evaporate out of existence.

That's how my world feels sometimes. As I've grown up I've come to realize how scary and hostile the world can be. I'm all alone in an existential sense. I don't have a support group. Every relationship/friendship I've clung to in the past has eventually turned into sand, casting me back adrift into the current. I've come to not put much stock in relationships for this reason.

I feel that everywhere I go people are telling me that I'm wrong, that my ideas are wrong, that what I'm doing is wrong. This constant siege mentality makes me angry and defensive. It's emotionally exhausting to have to have your guard up constantly. I'm a kind person and I want to help people, but I'm thin skinned and don't take criticism well. I wish I could give no fucks and ignore what people say, but I can't. Everything is personal.

I wish I could assert myself more. If I could do that, then I would no longer be the child in the crowd; I would be able to shove back. I could make my own space in this world.

But I can't do that because of my crushing self-confidence issues. (The inability to assert myself and my self-confidence are related and feed into each other like a vicious cycle.) 

I feel like if only I were really good at something, then I could cling to that ability and it would give me confidence. From that confidence I could become assertive, knowing that I have it in me. But there's no one thing that I'm really good at. I'm just meh across the board with no passions to pursue. I feel unemployable, unloveable, and not worth the space.

I recently went in for a job interview. It's a technical type job, and I've got some experience and certifications, but having no confidence in my abilities I choked. I panicked and blanked out. I didn't get the job.

I wish I could become a more solid person, strong enough and confident enough to be my own foundation. Maybe then I wouldn't mind being constantly under attack. Maybe then I could carve out a spot for me. 

**tl;dr**: I feel like everywhere I go people are taking issue with who I am/what I'm doing/what I believe. I have no self confidence and thus can't assert myself.

I am a 24 year old female, I live in the UK.

Throughout school I was unpopular, I was not bullied as such but I was ostracised by the other children. I met my first boyfriend when I was 16 and in my first year at a 6th form separate to my school. He was the first guy who ever paid me any notice at all, let's call him Jim. Jim was controlling, but due to the issues I'd had at school I wasn't even really aware of how a friendship was supposed to work let alone a relationship so it didn't set off alarm bells when he wouldn't let me go out without him. Jim was fairly awful to me, though he told me over and over again that he loved me. When I was 17 we had sex, I didn't want to but he just told me over and over again ""It's okay, I love you, you love me too, right?"" And I wasn't strong enough emotionally or physically to stop him. I didn't even think of it as rape although looking back now it probably was. I'd like to say I left Jim not long after that, but I didn't. I stayed with him until I left for university when I was 18.

When I arrived in the city I was going to be studying in suddenly all the things that had made me a freak in school were desirable to people. My hobbies, my quirks. I was instantly popular in the circles I moved in and it was overwhelming. I entered into a new relationship far too soon with a guy who seemed very sweet, I'll call him Leo. Leo and I had a lot in common, I thought I loved him, I let him sleep with me because I was pretty sure that was what love -was- thanks to Jim. I'm apparently amazing at attracting the worst types because before long Leo was putting all kinds of pressure on me. Deciding who I could be friends with, moving in with me, making me feel like an utter shit if I ever wasn't 'in the mood.' I never told Leo about Jim, I did try to tell him I was unhappy but he more or less didn't care. Fast forward to three years ago, I was rushed into hospital with severe abdominal pain. I was in intensive care for several days and had two sets of reasonably major surgery. I was sent home three weeks later hopped up on narcotics and had to go back in for more minor surgeries as an outpatient for the next month. Leo didn't visit me very much whilst I was in hospital, but pretty much as soon as I was out the pressure started up again. One of the side effects of one of the medications I was on was to knock out my birth control, but I was basically too high on painkillers to really know what I was doing. 

You can probably see where this is going, I got pregnant, Leo did not want me to be pregnant, we argued a lot but in the end decided to try and work it out for the kid. Bad idea I know but it seemed like the best option at the time. After a great many ups and downs we seperated for good when the kid was less than a year old. I've been much happier since then but I find in increasingly hard to trust anyone at all, not friends, family and definitely not men. I don't want to bring my child up that way, especially with the various other 'side-effects' of my life to date including an absolute and total inability to talk about anything related to intimacy. I figure I've got a few years to get over that before I end up scarring the kid for life but I don't even know where to start as far as fixing it goes.

&lt;b&gt;TL;DR: I went from one abusive relationship straight into another one, now I have a kid and I want to learn how to be able to depend on other people.&lt;/b&gt;",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_uqsnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/uqsnc/i_dont_know_how_to_trust/,

I’ve only been on a couple of dates since then and they were with the same guy. Nothing worth writing about happened between us. So I’m in a bit of a dry spell when it comes to dating for awhile now.

The only problem I have with this is that I’m jealous of all my friends’ relationships. Almost all of my close female friends are in relationships. My roommate, other people in my social circle at school, friends from home ect.

I’m really happy for all of them. Their guys treat them right and are generally good people and we all get along well. They are all amazing friends and I couldn’t be happier for them.

I just can’t stop these feelings of jealousy though. A couple of weeks ago my roommates’ boyfriend surprised her by taking her and a couple of friends to Cedar Point (a big roller coaster park) for her birthday. While I went and I had an amazing time I couldn’t help but feel jealous. I’ve never dated a guy that treated me as well as he treats her and I would over joyed if a boyfriend of mine was even around on my birthday, let alone taking me on a trip.

I have another friend whose’ boyfriend is alway buys her the best gifts for birthdays, Christmas, valentine’s day ect. I know material objects don’t matter but it’s really annoying to have to listen to her tell/show me all her new Vera Bradley purses when I’m working a minimum wage job and trying to save up for one.

And I’m sick of 75% of my facebook newsfeed being about some ones boyfriend. It’s annoying. You love your boyfriend and he loves you. Cool. I don’t need to read about it every night.

What bothers me most though is that every time I’m in a group social situation I’m usually the only single person there. It’s really starting to bother me more lately and I’ve been avoiding those types of situations which means that I’m usually home alone instead of out with my friends. I’ve hinted several times about “OMG girls night! We should do that! So much fun!” but it’s yet to happen.

Four years ago, I fell head over heels for this girl. I did everything absolutely wrong--I got waaaaaayyy too attached, put her on a pedestal, told everyone but her how I felt--literally, on the checklist ""how to not get a girl,"" I must have done all of them. 

We were in the same section in band. One night at a competition after we performed, we happened to be alone together. I don't remember what followed after that, but it was pathetic and embarrassing. I remember the word ""no"" being said quite a bit. I took it real hard, I was so crushed, I started smoking weed not too long after. It took my mind off of her.

After that, for the next two years we were distant and only talked to each other when we had to. 

I eventually realized that she will never have any interest in me and her and I would never be together because I royally fucked up everything with her.

I don't know why, but I still think about her. She still appears in my dreams. I still see her when I pick up my brother at school, and I get a rush of shitty/amazing feelings and thoughts every time.

I want to stop thinking about her. When I try to, I'm reminded of her somehow (her and I have mutual friends on Facebook), and she keeps coming back around on my carousel of thoughts.

Quick background: I'm a 19 y/o college student. I've never been in a real relationship; never even had my first kiss yet. I would definitely say I'm weird, but not unattractive. I'm quite petite, which my guy friends find 'cute' or something, and I've been asked out multiple times.  

But I always turn guys down because idk, I'm a bitch I guess (not sarcastic; just self-inquisitive)? I'll always find some sort of reason why I don't think it'll work. Sometimes I'm shallow and just straight up think ""I'm not physically attracted to this guy; it isn't going to work."" Other times I find other reasons, like ""He's so awkward"" or ""He isn't athletic enough"" or ""He's too tall"" (which seems like a legitimate reason to someone less than 5' tall). Those were the past 4 excuses I made. **This itself is a problem.** But this newest excuse is scaring me a bit: ""He's too innocent for me.""   

Now I know I appear super ultra innocent to everyone else on the outside (coz tiny and quiet and nerdy), and experience-speaking I have none so I'm pretty much the epitome of innocent. But the reason this is a throwaway account (lul) is because I'm really not. I feel like my sex drive is more on the level of a dude's than a chick's. I'm a horny mo'fucka. I don't watch porn, but I do read pornographic material (coz nerdy), and the more I do the more I'm realizing a vanilla sex life is probably not what I want o____o.  

But that's far down the line. Baby steps. Haven't even been kissed yet. So I don't know why this popped into my mind when one of my close guy friends made an advance on me (while both intoxicated a bit), but all I could think was ""Stop him now. He could never satisfy me."" Because being the quiet shy girl, of course my friends are equally those kind of quiet types.  

But then I get to thinking I'll never find a guy who would go along with some of the fantasies I have in my mind, which I figure is kinda equivalent to how guys get sex all hyped up in their mind from watching porn? And is something I shouldn't expect out of a future relationship? Which kinda gets me feeling bummed. And then also gets me worried because apparently I'm more lust-driven than LTR/love-driven.  

So what do I do? Or, more specifically:  
1) How do I stop running away from potential relationships? Am I being too picky? Should I at least give guys a chance before immediately turning it down? I sometimes feel like I have to say no (rather than 'lets give it a try') to avoid leading guys on since, 4/5 times, the guy who asks me out is a close friend.  
2) What do I do to calm this libido? I used to be morally against one night stands, but I'm becoming more open to the idea since I don't think it'll emotionally hurt me or anything--I'm not necessarily looking for love. What I am against though is ruining all my 'first's' (first kiss, losing virginity, etc) to people I don't care about; but this is gradually losing its importance to me, especially when alcohol is involved (how I've managed to avoid losing my first kiss while intoxicated is beyond me). Regardless, societal pressure makes me feel like a loser being this old and having had done nothing.  
3) What do I do about my expectations for actual relationships? Drop them like it's hot? Realistically speaking it's not likely I'll find a guy who meets all my ideal critereon given the social circles I keep. But I don't want to 'settle' either? I don't know &gt;_&lt;. 

**TL;DR** -- I'm a relationship noob who's just making more problems for myself, and I know little to nothing of what to do. I come from an extremely conservative (and religious) home where all of this is taboo to even talk about, so any perspective (positive or negative) of anything at all would be helpful.

I don't know why. Maybe it goes back to having overbearing parents who tried to suppress my emotions growing up. I've been to therapy, and I'm a little better now.

It seems like no matter what I do, my brain won't recognize that I'm doing something good. I was an honors student all through college, got accolades from my advisors saying I would go far and contribute a lot to the field... But there's a voice inside me constantly telling me my work is shit and that they're just delusional to think it's any good. I know that I'm intelligent, but I keep thinking that maybe I'm a fake. That I just write what people want to hear and it's devoid of actual thought. I know rationally this is not true, because I think about things intensely all the time, but I just can't shake the feeling. I feel briefly better after receiving positive feedback from someone, but I still feel like I've accomplished nothing in life.

I used to be overweight. I started dieting and got myself healthy. I think objectively speaking my body is fine, and even desirable, but part of me just feels weak and fat. I think this is really common. I just wish I could get rid of it because it feels like such a dumb thing to be depressed about.

I used to feel socially awkward and lonely. I finally found the right person to date, and they're amazing. We've never had any doubts about each other and honestly I've never believed it was possible to love someone so much. But again, my scumbag brain keeps trying to sabotage things. Saying shit like ""you're going to ruin this in the long-run because you're too immature,"" or even ""you're just doing this because it's easy and you're too lazy and scared to date around."" Again, rationally I know these things aren't true, but it still hurts. I never have these thoughts when we're together, mostly after I talk with my parents... It affects other relationships too. Like I sometimes worry I have no real friends and they're just humoring me by hanging out with me, even though in reality they have expressed affection and told me I'm ""cool"" and good to hang out with. A lot of times I think that I'm actually a horrible selfish person, and maybe I don't actually care about anyone but only use them for my own satisfaction. This makes no sense. I'll go out of my way to help a friend any time.

So, it's good to get that shit off my chest. I'm not sure what I should do. I keep trying to stay positive, hoping these thoughts will go away, but I always have relapses when I'm under extreme stress. *sigh*

He has lots of friends with whom he hangs out, while I’m utterly alone. As he’s put it, “Who is your confidant? Who do you have to call and grab a beer with when something’s bothering you?”

I just seem to completely lack the ability to make friends, and it isn’t for lack of trying my hardest. I’m not an antisocial shut-in at all. It just seems no matter how nice I am, how sociable I am, nobody wants to spend time with me of their own accord on a casual basis. Every time I extend an invitation to hang out, I get ignored or shut down.

For example, I was at a party last weekend with my boyfriend. We split up and spent the party circulating on our own—and I had a great time meeting new people and getting to know them. So what happened? Nobody was interested in exchanging info with me or hanging out at a future date. This happens every time: I’ve done the Meetup.com thing, I’ve been to Reddit meetups. It’s the same story repeated ad nauseum.

Even though I know I'm a nice, smart, interesting person, I feel like I’m just too late; everyone’s social circles are already well-established and there’s no room left for me.

Why don’t I have friends already? Life circumstances always seem to work against me. All through high school and college I was a competitive equestrian and spent most of my time crisscrossing the country going to shows. In grad school, I worked full-time—unlike most of my classmates—and so couldn’t make it to school events or social meetups because they always fell during my work hours.

I guess before I even engage into the issue I should provide a little background information.

My parents divorced when I was in Kindergarten (5 years old I guess?). I don't know what happened but I ended up living in another country (I was born in the US), with my grandparents (fathers side) in Asia for roughly two years. Then I come back to the US.

Fast forward through a bunch of BS, I move to a new neighborhood.

At this point in the story I'm 9 or 10 years old, fourth grader in Elementary school. I get into a ""relationship"", - as you would expect it didn't really work out. That's cool and all, but I didn't take it too well.

I get really emotional over this, cry in school/class - start getting depressed, at one point even said I'll kill myself. This goes on for around a year or two (being a downer).

Over Jr. High I just blocked the memory - acted like it never happened - went okay I guess.

Now comes high school. Unfortunately I live in the same house since i came to the US. A couple of faces I saw in Elementary school are in my High School, including the girl I was in a ""relationship"" with in 4th grade..

My fear is that they know what happened in 4th grade - I don't talk to anyone from my Elementary school because I know they know what happened.

I believe this issue affects my relationships (the three I had after 4th grade, last one being over 2-3 years ago) and friendships.. I'm afraid of making friends in fear that this story gets into circulation.

How do I get over this? Maybe I should just continue being embarrassed and once I get out of high school go to a out of state college..

I find that whenever I engage socially I sublimate my own personality in order to please other people, when people try to treat me on an equal level and inquire about me I have a really hard time coming up with what to say. In the past I've been more comfortable around older people, where I can take a role of subservience I guess. I don't like being in a position of authority or where people rely on me, but I also don't like the role I normally assume. I actually feel bitter with a lot of my friends, I always sympathize with the back stabbing villain in stories. I do this sort of behavior so much it feels like I don't even know who I am. It's like I wear so many different masks that I no longer know what my face looks like, like I'm the chameleon who doesn't know what his true color is. How do I work on this? What is wrong with me?

I've had only 3 girlfriends in my life and all of them have left me for little to no reason. Only one did it for another guy and another one keeps popping up to torment me. I've also noticed that these girls leave me for lesser people. I've been smarter, more athletic, more courteous than all the people they've left me for. 

Lets start with the most recent. She was the one that I loved the most and the one that hurt me the worst. I moved across the country for her and attended a college that I didn't really like. I lost all of my past for her. After a year, she told me that she wanted to take a break because I was too old (I am 5 years older than her). She lied to me about her age. She told me she was 17 but she was only 16. During the this break I didn't take any other girlfriends. But she was with another guy and he was very abusive to her. She came back to me and professed her love and all that and I accepted her back.

A year after that, she was cheating on me with a girl. I was devastated. So, yesterday she texts me and tells me about how how I was the only person who ever treated her right and how she's cutting herself and how that girl cheats on her. I tried to resist but I fell back into her traps and she said today that she never wanted me back and that she was only wanting me as a friend and I said I didn't want that and she started yelling at me about how I treat her like shit. This got me mad and for the first time ever I yelled at her and I literally told her all that I was holding in about how I loved her with all my heart and she's the one who ruined her life.

She said she was lying about everything and that she never wanted to see me again. I feel kind of bad for yelling at her but she was accusing me of the stuff I hated that those others did and it really got to me.

The one before that. She had just broken up with her previous boyfriend and she told me that she wanted to be with me. I was excited. I had gotten sick that day though and I didn't see her again for 3 days. We had been sending emails back and forth though. When I got better I went to go meet her at her hang out spot and she was there making out with another girl. I asked her about it and she said that she changed her mind and she didn't want to be with guys anymore. I know that she is married to a guy right now. She also got mad at me for reacting with sadness to the lesbian news.

The first girl I met in high school and she basically had a ""real"" boyfriend behind my back and only used me to buy her stuff and make her feel better.

I put all my effort into making things work out but it seems like it is never enough. Everybody around me has somebody and I am just forever alone. I feel like there must be something fundamentally wrong with me or I'm the butt of a giant cosmic joke.

I am not sexually or romantically attracted to men or women, I have never been. I don't know if my abuse has anything to do with it because I was too young to know if I had any sexual feelings before it happened. So there's no way for me to know if I would still be asexual if I was not abused, but I know that I definitely am. 

My friend and I were talking about sex today. She's encouraging me to try it because I'm still a virgin, I've never even kissed someone. When I first started masturbating(like at 17), I was not able to separate what I was doing vs. what my abuser did to me for years. My hand was his and after I'd do it I'd feel like shit and want to kill myself. It's not like that now, though, sometimes it is but not anywhere near as intense. I know masturbating is ok, I know sex is ok, but I don't want to have sex, I don't feel anywhere near ready and I don't know who I'd try it with since I'm not attracted to anyone. I don't really see a purpose for it, but I guess my friend makes some sense in wanting me to try it, I mean, why not? I like orgasms, if sex will be another way of getting that, it might be worth a try(or a few, according to my friend the first time is never good). I'll probably try sex when I'm older, a few years. I'm worried that I'll deeply regret it and feel very violated and traumatized by it because I'm still connecting sex with some awful thing that happened when I was a kid. I'm stuck and I can't get over it because my abuser is dead and I can't get closure. I'm still working on that, but I need help separating what happened with what's normal. I have a therapist, but he's a guy, I don't know if I'd be comfortable talking about this stuff the way I did to my friend, but I guess I need to because my friend isn't able to help me the way my therapist probably can.

What should I do besides ask my therapist's advice? What advice would you guys give me? 

Also, i know some people are going to say I am not asexual because I like masturbating, but I am. I don't feel anything at all towards anyone sexually or romantically, but my body likes orgasms, so that's just what that is.

From 14-22 I was a serial monogamist. I went a year when I was 20 without a boyfriend and it kinda sucked but I still felt pretty hopeful, still felt like I'd surely find a new guy any second. Sure enough, eventually I did, had an awesome 1 year relationship that ended terribly. Spent 23 just kind paralyzed in my depression. Spent 24 doing everything I could to get out of it including going on 25+ first dates (internet dating) and starting therapy.

I just don't get it. I have a good job, I do good volunteer work, I'm athletic... I'm not ugly... I'm not a model but I'm not ugly either-- I mean I've got clear skin, I smell OK, I'm not overweight, I keep my nails done and my hair reasonable looking. I put on mascara and earrings everyday. I have excellent teeth.

I think I'm pretty fun too. I mean I like going out, I'm adventurous, I'm not shy... 

I think sadly my standards might be too high. I say 'sadly' when I say this because I think my standards are pretty low. I mean I don't need a guy who's super athletic-looking (although that would be nice) but someone who takes care of themselves and puts just a little effort (shaving/shower ~ once a day, hit the gym or play a sport once a week, does not always wear kahki pants) is important to me. A guy who has some friends of their own so they don't cling to me. Major mental health problems are OK-- *as long as* they're getting treatment and functioning relatively normally. I'd like a guy who has a job but I'd settle for one who has a general life plan. Someone who wants to be in a relationship? Idk. I even like the idea of swinging and would not dump a guy for cheating under most circumstances. I'm ggg. I read Dan Savage every week and agree with 90% of what he says. I think porn is awesome.

I'm a 21 year old female who no longer knows how to be happy. In the past I have always had a very high level of self confidence. I never compared myself to anybody and was happy with myself and how I lived my life. I dated a girl and we broke up because she cheated on me, but even then, I didn't lose confidence in myself. 

At the beginning of 2011, I met a girl and a guy through a class we all shared. I became friends with the girl first. I can't say too much about about her because she is an avid redditor, but trust me when I say that she was amazing. She was a talented musician, artist, comedian, scientist, and an incredibly likable person. I'm pretty sure she's amazing at everything she tries. Through her, I became friends with this guy. He is also an avid redditor and was equally amazing, although in different ways. I found him to be passionate, driven, incredibly intelligent, and his mind worked in a way I've never known - very 'thinking outside the box'. Because of this, he is incredibly sought-after in his field, despite being so young. 

After a few months of knowing these people casually, the guy started reaching out to me (it turns out that he was dating the girl and she'd broken up with him, but I didn't know this at the time) and I was thrilled because we had very similar personalities and interests. We became closer and entered what can only be described as a relationship. We talked constantly and saw each other every day. He acted like a boyfriend, and treated me like his girlfriend (to the point that we would kiss when we felt extra-close to each other). To this day I don't know what went wrong. We haven't talked now for the past month and a half, and I've deleted him from all social media as I became sick of watching him actively ignore me. Before I deleted him, I watched him become closer to his ex again on facebook. This made me feel terrible, as it seemed that he was going back to his ex (for attention, not for a relationship: she's been happily dating somebody else for months) because she was so amazing and I couldn't live up to the expectations she'd set for him.

My problem is this. Ever since meeting these people, I have been unhappy within myself. I feel as though I wasn't good enough for either of them, especially him (for obvious reasons). I used to be content just happily living my life, but now I feel I should be doing something more worthwhile with my time. My hobbies no longer make me happy, and I've been frantically trying to find new ones in a desperate attempt to make myself feel worthy. I feel that I am not interesting enough, smart enough, funny enough or talented enough...for anybody. It has been a crushing blow. I have never had this little confidence in myself, and I don't know how to get it back. I wish I'd never met these people, as knowing them has made me realize everything I am not.

**TL;DR** Ever since meeting two particularly amazing people, I have had crippling self-confidence issues and have been incredibly unhappy. I feel I'm wasting my life and should be doing something more worthwhile, however even when I do try new things, it does not ease this pain. Has anybody else gone through this or anything remotely like it? How did you overcome it and find peace within yourself? I want to get to a point where I can feel equal to these people, as right now I feel so terribly inferior. Hell, I want to reach a point where I don't bother comparing myself to others. I always knew I was never special, but now I truly feel it, and it hurts. I'm sick of feeling useless.

You go into college with certain expectations.  Now, I didn't expect to live Animal House or anything, but there are perceptions of college in the zeitgeist that really made me look forward to it.  In High school, I was kind of an introvert.  People liked me well enough, and I got along with my classmates, but I hardly ever hung out with people outside of school.  I was hoping that things would change in college.

I was expecting drinking, maybe a little trees.  I was looking for that quintessential group of close-knit friends with dating and sex and videogame parties.  Nothing too hardcore, but close-knit and comfortable.

I make a friend, I meet my roommate, we meet the two girls in the room one floor down.  We have a night of boozing (my first experience with alcohol) and laughing.  Everything is perfect.  Literally perfect.

The two girls both had boyfriends left over from highschool, but before too long, 'L' breaks up with hers, and starts dating my friend.  'D' was my dream girl.  She was smarter than me, she was geekier than me, she was more adventurous and more experienced than me.  After that first night, the two of us pass out on her bed.  We didn't have sex, still clothed, and didn't even kiss.

I fell for her, hard.  When we were hanging out, I would do affectionate little things like put my arm around her or play with her hair a little.  I didn't know how to say to her that I liked her, but she knew.  There were more than a few occasions that I tried to replicate that first perfect night.

The thing is, I never got any response.  No positive reinforcement, no negative reinforcement.  I would put my arm around her and she wouldn't lean into me, nor would she tell me to fuck off.  I later learned from L that she just didn't want to hurt my feelings.  She never broke up with her boyfriend, who was at another college in the city.  He was studying the same thing as me, he looked a lot like me, and he even had the same name as me.

After our freshman year, my grades were slipping.  She transferred to another school.  I didn't last another semester, and dropped out halfway through my sophomore year.

I decided not to be 'that guy' and move back in with my parents after dropping out.  I got an apartment with the money I had saved from my HS job.  For nearly 6 months, I didn't leave the apartment.  I watched hours of TV and only left to get groceries.  I was extremely depressed.  Finally I ran out of money and had to get a job.  I started work, but didn't really make any friends there.  It was like High school again, I got along but didn't really see anyone outside of work.  After a few months a new girl started working there that I thought was pretty alright, but I didn't really have the courage to ask her out.

I eventually started up classes at another school, which is where I am now, part-time.  I've met some people, but haven't made any friends outside of classes.  as a night school student, there isn't really the social group thing going on that I missed out on the first go-round.

I started working at this other place, which is where I work now, and I got into a serious relationship with someone I met who also worked there.  It lasted a year, and about 6 months in I had pretty much moved in with her.  The thing was, I wasn't ready to get that serious yet.  I feel like I've missed out on all the fun stuff that never happened in college.  I've never dated casually, I've never hooked up with a friend randomly (I don't have any to do that with), I haven't really been out clubbing or to wild parties. She tried to help me with that, but she told me on multiple occasions that when she was wild at college (she was 25, I was 24) and out barhopping and getting drunk had hooking up with guys, she felt bad about herself.  So that kind of experience that she was tired of, she didn't help me to get.

Since breaking up with her, I've tried to be more extroverted, I've tried making new friends.  I've made it a policy to say yes to everything I can.  I met some undergrads at my new school, but I felt that the age gap made things awkward.  I got on well enough with people, and there was one girl that I hit it off with.  The problem is, once the project we were working on ended (I volunteered to build sets for a play), we haven't really talked.  I've messaged her a few times on FB and had conversations.

I've kind of reached the point where I'll try anything.  I even started a profile on a dating site.

**//TL:DR** If you skipped the rest of it, start reading here.  it's not a summary, it's the important bit.  the rest was all background.

Every time I meet a girl I want to have a go at, I feel so horrifically anxious and awkward.  I try to start a conversation and maybe it goes well and maybe it doesn't, but I can't really try to initiate anything.  I feel like I'm not worth it to them, that I have nothing to offer them, or that they already have something better going on.  I am constantly thinking that if they wanted to have a relationship with me, they would let me know (&lt;that was the most important sentence on this entire page). The thing is - they don't.  The one I met while working on the play, I tried a little test.  I noticed that every time we spoke, I was the one to initiate.  So I stopped messaging her on facebook.  If she really wanted to talk to me, and if my conversations were actually enjoyed and not merely tolerated, surely she would message me sometime, right?  I haven't spoken to her in three months.

It's been like that with every girl I meet now.  I need them to let me know that they want me.  I need them to hit on me.  If I'm the only one talking, I feel like it's D all over again, like i'm creeping all over someone who can't stand me but is too nice to tell me off.

I'm seeing a therapist now, but I wanted some input.

Actually, I really just wanted to get all this out there, it felt good typing it.

I just don't know what it is with me. I'm a 21 year old cute girl as everyone says. 
A lot of guys have a crush on me, as I seem to be different than most girls they've met. And I'm able to gain other people's trust within a short time. I'm the person anyone can go to and talk to about their problems and I'll comfort them as much as possible. 

I play all of the modern games, I make my own music, I play 5 instruments. I read a lot, I love physics, maths, chemistry, biology and so on. I'm open-minded, understand a lot of people's problems, I can relate to them. I also have a weird sense of humor that people seem to love.

In real life most people don't care much for me. I don't have any friends in real life anymore. The only people interested in me are guys who are looking for a one time thing. I have a chronically sickness and can't go out, can't have a job or go to school. 


My problem is, I have met so many nice guys, even if it was just online. I just felt nothing for them, I wasn't even slightly interested in them. I can't tell if this is because I feel like I am not good enough for anyone or if it is that I can tell they wouldn't be able to deal with me and how I am. There was one guy I loved a lot and still do, he doesn't talk to me anymore.

I feel lonely. I want to feel loved and have someone who cares about me. There's a lot of people who love me, close friends, it just doesn't make me feel less lonely. Why? It's been this way my whole life and the only person that made me feel not alone was him.

I've just started college and, as the title says, I'm worried about  making friends. My problem isn't that I'm too afraid to talk to people, or things like that - although I am a little shy, I've been trying very hard to work on that over the past few months and I've been able to strike up conversations with complete strangers in college really well in the 4 weeks since I started. I've gotten on quite well with a few people and have gone to lunch, society meetings, etc with them.

My problem is now, that I seem to over-think things once I get to this stage of being casually friendly with someone. I worry that I'm too awkward, or boring, or clingy, or annoying, that they don't really want me around. I feel like this with my friends from home as well; although there are one or two that I feel confident around, with the rest I can never quite shake the feeling that they only like the other people in my group of friends, and just put up with me for the sake of being nice. I don't know if this is actually true, or if I'm just not confident enough in myself :/

I know I'm not good enough friends with the people from college I've been talking to to get worried about all this stuff yet, but I'm scared that if I don't somehow become better friends with them soon they'll all have formed better friendships and I'll be even more left out. (just in case I'm coming across wrongly here, I do genuinely like these people, and my friends from home, I'm not just trying to to be friends with them for the sake of it). 

So... tl;dr: I get anxious about my friendships and I want to stop. How do I do this? And how do I let people know I want to get to know them better/hang out more/that I like them and want to be friends without coming across as pathetic or needy?

I am still a little drunk and on reddit and I do not want to screw this up, because I really do love her. I was hoping you could help lend some advice or personal experience to this because I do not know what to do. I apologize in advance for all of the text but your help is so appreciated. 

Some back story to help bring you up to speed in this complicated relationship. I am 24M and she is 23F. We met in high school and while we never ""officially dated"" we were incredibly close. She is the closest relationship I have had and I think I am the closet one she has had. 

She ""friend zoned"" me but I still loved her. I never told her how I truly felt. I told myself it was because I did not want to mess up what we had. Though really, I am a pussy who was too afraid of risking what we shared because I really did enjoy what we had. 

We would do things like talk on the phone constantly, hang out every chance we got, and talk about everything. We even made that promise that we would get married at 35 if neither of us found anyone by then.

After a great year long relationship, we had a falling out over some argument and she was the one that ultimately that ended the relationship. I do not remember the exact details but it was probably similar to what dissolves a lot of high school relationships. A lot of stuff was said in the moment on both sides that helped make things worse. Instead of taking a stand and fighting for the relationship I believed in, I let my thick headed pride get in the way.

Eventually we did reconnect towards the end of high school. We had lunch a couple of times and still remained friendly on a superficial level. After high school she went to college on the other side of the country and I stayed close to home. We would correspond through Facebook every couple of months but nothing more than ""hey how's school/life?"". Mainly she would be the one asking. 

Flash forward to a year ago or so ago. She reached out to me out of the blue and our relationship started going from simple superficial Facebook interactions, to texting every now and then, to talking on the phone for a couple of hours at a time. While it is not as intense as it was back in high school, it has been great reconnecting with her.

I recently took a job about 8 hours from where she is going to school, and she came down to visit this weekend. We had been talking about this for awhile now. She and I got obliterated at a bar and reminisced about the old days. After a long pause and awkward kiss we started making out in the bar and then went back to my place. There we had sex, and it was more than some empty drunk hookup. I really didn't get the chance to say anything to her before she she passed out and here I am now. 
 
Throughout the past seven year I have still loved her. She has always been on my mind and no matter what I would do or the women I saw, I never stopped thinking about her. No one has been able to match to what she and I had.

However, I have not told her how I feel because I have been too afraid.

What do I do now? What should I say? Up until tonight I never even kissed her. I do want to tell her how I feel, but I don't want to look like a naive jackass saying I love her after one drunken night, if you get what I am saying. I really do not want to ruin the relationship we have been rebuilding over the past year because I think there may be potential for this relationship to be something more.

When I was about 11 and my sister was about 5, I was a sexually curious kid. We had an anatomy textbook on one of our family bookshelves that I read in secret many times, fascinated at the female parts. I got really curious, though. Unhealthily so.

I started abusing my sister, long story short. It went from taking our clothes off and looking to me actually attempting to put my penis in her vagina. I can't look back on it without shaking and feeling nauseous, now. I'm certainly not pedophilic - I just didn't understand that what I was doing was wrong. 

My parents found out about it after a few months. They were both livid and scared, with good reason. We didn't seek any professional help because they were both afraid that I would end up in some sort of legal trouble. We handled it ourselves, as it were, and life went on. 

Now, I'm 18 and my sister is 12. She's started to hit puberty. Recently, she's been flashing back to those months seven years ago when I abused her. She's getting scared and depressed and doesn't want to talk to me. Obviously, I feel terrible. This was something I didn't understand then, and now I'm forced to see the cost. It breaks my heart to know that I've hurt her so badly.

What can I do now, though? Clearly, some closure is needed. I feel like we swept it under the rug years ago and now that's come back to bite us. What can I say to her? What can we do, as a family? My parents are both reluctant to go seek professional help for the aforementioned reason: they don't want me getting in legal trouble.

TL;DR I abused my sister seven years  ago; she's now hit puberty and is flashing back; what can I do or say to alleviate her trauma?

EDIT: If it helps, she still talks to me and we play Minecraft together on a regular basis. My mom only told me today that my sister feels uncomfortable sometimes.

and here it is cut and pasted...

&gt;Any tips? Specifically?

    .

I don't have a tv, nor do I subscribe to any magazines. Honestly, comments about women on reddit have affected my self confidence more than any digitally enhanced celebrity I've seen idolized. Obviously, my ""real-life"" experiences of rejection and feeling over-looked have contributed a lot, but comments on reddit, by a man I will never meet, who is probably a 500+ lb basement dweller who is as addicted to porn as WOW have left me in tears. Actually shaking with rage and despair. I KNOW it isn't healthy. I've read The Beauty Myth. I've done a lot of ""work"" with my therapist.

    .

I was raped when I was a teenager and during it, the guy lost his erection and said ""Look, you're so fat I can't even keep it up"" and proceed to do something even worse. It is true that I was never a skinny girl growing up, but MOST adult women today would kill for the body I had (I know I would to get it back!). I already had pretty low self esteem because being a teenager is rough, and not having the body type currently in fashion just compounds your feeling of worthlessness. Those words, at that time in my life, affected me A LOT more than the rape and violence. I've been in therapy. I worked it out. I understand what was going on there and for the most part, I ""got over that"".

    .

A few years later I married a saint of a man who loved me like crazy and was very patient with my body issues. Insane crash diets + heroic exercise regimens followed by binging slip-ups followed by a discouraged and depressed period caused my weight and fitness to fluctuate wildly, but he loved me the same no matter what. The only problem was that sex was physically painful for me for the first several years of our marriage, and that stressed him out (being a nice, wonderful guy) and made him not enjoy it. He couldn't have an orgasm with me, and every time we ""gave up"" and finished ourselves off, my belief that my disgusting body was unable to satisfy any man (even one that I knew loved me) was cemented further. (Unfortunately, this was pre-internet, so I had never even HEARD of a man not being able to orgasm - I was CONVINCED for years that there was NOTHING wrong with HIM, and it was entirely MY FAULT for being unattractive - we didn't make the ""pain/stress connection"" for several years.)

    .

After our divorce I was in a bit of a crisis-induced manic episode. We now had the internet and I had ""worked out"" a lot of my self-image issues. I went into an impressive slut-phase (we had the internet now!) and gave casual sex a go. I met men that were completely unsatisfying lovers, but they were so happy to be getting some that they seemed oblivious to my body flaws. That was nice and helpful in a way, but for me (as with a lot of women) casual sex turned out to be a soul-crushing endeavor and so I had to stop for my heart and my sanity.

    .

Enter my first rebound relationship: A pretty good guy who was eerily like my ex-husband in a lot of ways. On one weekend at his place he showed me some pictures on his computer and oops! a picture of him with a breathtakingly beautiful ex-girlfriend was in the mix. He quickly and sheepishly forwarded past it, but I played it cool and asked if that was ""Sally"" (names changed for privacy) he said it wasn't, that it was ""Mary"" but that he probably had a picture of Sally in there somewhere if I wanted to put a face with the stories... I played it cool, and while I KNEW it was a bad idea, I just ""had"" to see it, you know? One thing leads to another and I am acting completely nonplussed as my rebound guy shows me concrete proof that I am, in fact, the least attractive woman he has ever been with. I didn't bitch, or cry, or act jealous... I KNOW how unattractive and pathetic that is... Besides, he was an honest person, and I am not capable of suspending disbelief enough to believe the sweet lies I would need to hear to feel better about the situation so I didn't let on my discomfort.

    .

UNTIL that night. We started getting undressed and I was trembling. He noticed and asked what was wrong and I started to cry. I explained how embarrassed I was and how silly I knew I was being, but that I wasn't prepared to see the type of women he was used to being with. I apologized and tried to salvage the mood but it was gone. Great. Now HE can't get it up, which exacerbates my insecurity... We cuddle. He sweetly says while stroking my hair ""my name, it IS true that most of the women before you have been unusually attractive, but I'm with you now, and I don't mind this (indicating my body) and NONE of them have been as sweet or as intelligent as you are, and that (indicating my brain) is what makes you beautiful to me.""

    .

A very sweet thing to hear, but the only part that really seared itself into my insecure brain was him gesturing at my midsection and saying ""I don't mind this"".

    .

We broke up months later for unrelated reasons and a while later I meet the next one I was trying to fill the husband-size-hole left in my life with. The only thing HE had in common with the other two is his career choice. Other than that, he was the complete opposite. I realize now that it was a terrible match from the very beginning, and it only shows what a bad emotional place I was in when we hooked up, but at the time, I was REALLY trying to make it work.

    .

Then we had the ""where is this relationship going"" talk. He said that he didn't know, because even though everything had been great and fun, and I was really easy to get along with, he had never really envisioned himself ending up with ""someone like me""... I am capable of remaining cool and collected when I need to be, so I asked him to elaborate. He hemmed and hawed and then said ""Well, I've never been attracted to your body type before, but I DO enjoy having sex with you anyway"" I said ""OK, what else did you mean by ""someone like me""""? He had nothing. NOTHING else.

    .

I clarified that he WAS saying that I was a perfect girlfriend in EVERY WAY except for his lack of sexual attraction. He said ""yes, but I don't think it is worth breaking up over!"" I was so beaten down emotionally that I accepted that and our relationship dragged out for several more months.

    .

I haven't been with a man in almost two years, even though I ""know"" that I am what A LOT of men are looking for. I see uglier women than me out in public with their happy boyfriends and spouses all the time.

    .

I understand where I'm getting all these messages of inadequacy and I do my best to tune them out. I understand what was REALLY going on in my failed relationships now. I am smart, and often funny. I am a bitch on the internet but irl I am one of the most generous and empathetic women you will ever meet.

    .

Please believe me when I tell you that I am not ""obsessed with beauty"" as most women are. I don't have a large shoe collection. I don't cake on makeup. I don't struggle with my aging face and hair and body as so many women my age do. I am ""aging gracefully"" in that I've accepted it and I make an effort to stay physically active only for health reasons. I have other things that I value about myself, and if you were to meet me, you probably would be surprised to discover my true self-loathing.

    .

My little sister is HOT. She dates celebrities. She has a well managed eating disorder (in that she is incredibly thin and goes to insane lengths to keep herself that way, but she doesn't allow herself to cross over into the sickly side of the scale) SHE has ALWAYS based a lot of her sense of self worth on her body and style. It is obvious upon meeting her that she is very caught up in the fashion world. (It is also her career). I love her, but I've always thought it was more than a little pathetic, and that she was in for a rude awakening when age catches up to her... But when I am honest with myself, I realize that my body image shapes my life more than hers does for hers.

    .

What else can I do? I ""get it"" intellectually, I know what is going on with me, yet I am absolutely crippled by it.

    .

TL;DR I am smart enough to realize how stupid these hangups are and where they come from, but I've done everything to get over them but nothing has worked. Do you have any advice?

Edit: Holy shit. I had NO IDEA this comment was going to be so long as I was typing it. I guess I really needed to get some of this off my chest!

TL:DR for male redditors: STOP BEING SO MEAN AND CRITICAL OF WOMEN'S BODIES ON THE INTERNET! EVEN IN THESE ANONYMOUS FORUMS THEY ARE MORE HURTFUL THAN YOU REALIZE!

I was so scared and freaked out that I had peed myself, but I found that it didn't smell like anything. And I didn't have an 'urge to pee' before or after this orgasm.

I think I squirted, I'm almost certain but still I can't help wondering what happened. :S What do you think? Can I celebrate my first time squirting, or did I just nearly wet the bed? lol u_u

I'm the oldest of 4 kids, 2 to my mom and stepdad, 1 to my dad and stepmom. My mom's two are 4 and 12 years younger than I, and my dad's is 15 years younger. 

I have a really hard time feeling connected to my youngest brother. My other one I grew up with in the same house until I was 14. My sister, though 12 years younger, is my only sister and I absolutely adore her. But my youngest brother was born just after I moved into my dad's house. I was just turning into a teenager, going through changes. and moved out of there when I was 18. I now live 2 hours away in a different city with my gf and her daughter, and work back home 3 days a week. It's almost like I forget he is my brother sometimes. Not intentionally, and I feel so low when I do. But it's always this feeling of ""wow, i DO have another sibling"". He looks up to me and admires me so much and so obviously. Yet I have such a hard time connect with him. I have some issues with his parents that I don't think will ever be resolved, and therefore don't spend a lot of time visiting them so i know that is a factor. But he is my brother, I should be able to have the connection I have with my other one regardless of my issues with my parents. and I just don't know why I can't.

My first date over time also ended up being my first kiss and fuck (I was the same for him). Over time though he just didn't like me the same way anymore that I was beginning to feel more of a sister and he was sorry.
After feeling shitty for a few months I wanted to see new people and have a new partner in crime to be with. I don't get to meet a lot of people my age so I tried online. I got some attention, mostly men that were either too old for me or not my type so I look for guys rather than just sitting around and hoping.
When I find a guy I'm interested in I make some small talk and ask to go out on a date to meet. It usually seems to turn out just fine, nothing magical or anything but the guys seem to enjoy talking to me, laugh when I kid around, and they say the had a fun time, hell most of them ended up saying I'm pretty or something nice too which feels awesome.

So far though none of them never wanted wanted to go out with me again dispite what the might of said eailier. They don't feel something a on the lines of a 'spark' or a 'click'. I didn't think i should expect that on the first date and I honestly i just like hanging out and getting close to someone but it seems people don't want the same for me.

Could be wrong with me? What should I do? I know nobody can control their feels but this seems to be all the guys I have interest in.

Every girl that has dumped me since High School has said it was because I was too controlling.  The most recent one added uncompromising.  I feel like every relationship I have improved this behavior a little bit, hoping maybe I've done so enough, but obviously not.  

I like to plan things.  Plan out my day, and I do not react well when something doesn't go according to plan. I've been this way as long as I can remember.  I remember birthday parties in elementary school that if things didn't go the way I wanted them to I would freak out.  It has gotten better with every subsequent relationship, however its still killing them.  

The most recent girl I was with (22F) was afraid to disappoint me so much she wouldn't tell me if she didn't like something I did.  If she were to tell me she was leaving work at 5PM, then meeting me at x place at 6:30PM and I found out she actually left work at 5:15 or 5:30 I would get pissed.  I'm not really sure how to reign in this behavior.  I'm honestly not sure where the line of reason is.

My controlling aspects do not extend to a gf's friends anymore.  Earlier in HS and college I would try to control that, but that is one of the behaviors I managed to get under control.  However I still find that girls I date do not spend a lot of time with their friends, even if I encourage them to do so. I think maybe I'm still putting out controlling vibes.

Another related problem is I have a hard time accepting a person as they are.  Every serious relationship I've had, I've attempted to change the person to suit me.  I've tried forcing my interests on them.  I've tried to control where the dates are, what we do, etc.  I've noticed I do this while being unwilling to change anything about myself to suit them, i.e. trying their interests, going to where they want to go, etc.. Another example is I insist we stay that night at my place.  I hate sleeping at their place. I guess that is where I'm uncompromising.  

Now all of this could be explained by the fact I'm an only child.  I want to have a successful relationship, and I think I have happiness of offer a girl, but I can't seem to reign in these destructive behaviors completely. I understand that to some degree I am who I am, but every girl has cited these behaviors as a reason they've left me.  Please help, how can I work on this?

I was in an incredible 5 year relationship and my boyfriend left me for another girl completely out of no where. We talked about getting married and children so I was completely caught off guard by all of this. I honestly didn't have a very hard time getting over him because I know I deserve better than that and I would say I'm a pretty tough person (not manly, just not very emotional). 

Now 5 years later, I'm still single and can't manage to find/stay in a relationship. 
Every guy I meet I think they are going to leave me (even when things are great). And every relationship I'm in starts off really good and strong then completely crashes... I try everything in my power to keep the relationship going even when it isn't working. 

Currently, I've been seeing a guy (28) for 3 months. Technically we are FWB but we don't sleep with other people... We went from seeing each other 3 times a week and now I only see him once every 2 weeks (he's very busy) and I'm not cool with it, but I'm still stuck to him. The prior relationship, we were FWB for 10 month and I was crazy about him... Didn't work out because I moved out of the country temporarily, but we are still friends and I'm still crazy about him. What do I put up with this?

When I'm not in the presence of the person I'm dating I crave attention from other guys (not physical just talking and acknowledgment). I feel like I've developed a small attention whore persona in a way, I'm not loud and obnoxious in anyway, I just want the attention on me. I hate that I'm like this and I can't stop.

I (28m) broke up with my ex (24f) of 3 1/2 years because of many valid issues that many friends pointed out over and over again. I initiated the breakup because I felt and still feel that I deserver better, and that it would improve my life.

Unfortunately, I am confronted now with the status of permanent bachelor. I can't seem to meet women, and those that I do meet don't seem interested. I've been trying online dating, and I feel like it's been a waste of time, money, and heart so far. 

It really stings to see my ex have no problems at all getting guys interested in her. She's been on a bunch of dates and now is seeing someone. I've been on a single date, and my attempts to use OkCupid to find someone have been nothing short of a failure. For the record, I've been on there for about 2 months so far.

You need to love yourself before others can love you, or so the saying goes. It's kinda hard to feel good about myself when my mental image of myself is that of a social leper. I am not socially inept, I can have conversations with people at parties and enjoy the hell out of this.

My issue is with taking it to the next level. Now that I'm single, the idea of talking to a bunch of different girls all at once is extremely intimidating. What if more than one of them express intrest at the same time?  How do I decide?

The reality is that **none of them ever show any intrest.** This negative defeatist attitude is beginning to impact my ability to perform at work. I'm just so down and dejected that it's hard to for me to focus... I end up here on reddit or on OkCupid (which I am starting to think hurts more than it helps) or just aimlessly browsing the web.

I am not sure how to be ok with being single/alone. I don't miss the dependency and financial drain of my ex, but I do miss the companionship and camaraderie. I'm having trouble turning myself into someone that people would want to be with me, because I am so depressed that nobody wants to be with me.

His wife(Becca 5 months pregnant) and I got along great. She called one night, we met up for coffee and everything us was fine. We came together to get him back for what happened. I soon realized that she wasn't going to stop making snide comments about me and the situation. ""What makes you so special?"" and ""I don't do half the things you do, I'm a good girl."" Were some of the ones that got to me. After a while these started to mess with me and even now I still believe it was my fault. I know I was the one who got lied to, but I still can't shake this feeling. 
Becca kept asking why I didn't see different things in the house of hers. I saw plenty of female items throughout the house. Alan also had two roomates. One female and her boyfriend. Naturally there were female products everywhere. 
I told Alan from the beginning that I don't do the serious dating thing so of course I didn't go through his files and private things. I wasn't exactly too interested in his private things because he wasn't interested in mine. 
All too quickly feelings got involved (Becca was out of town for a few months visiting family) and the ""L"" word came into play. He tried to keep me around after his wife and I were plotting against him. She got pissed. Of course when I told him off and stopped talking to him he wanted to fix things with Becca.
I tried to be a good friend and help this girl out but no matter what I say, she keeps throwing it in my face that I slept with her husband. As time kept on she realized he told me more of the truth about his life than her. 
I just don't know how to stop myself from feeling like this is my fault for being stupid and trusting. It's not like I'm anyones idea of the perfect housewife.

I live in a great city but I'm too poor to fully enjoy all it has to offer and that frustrates me SO MUCH. I also can't seem to act like a fucking adult and keep my apartment clean. It's actually dirty, and the only times it gets properly cleaned is when my boyfriend and I team up and do it on our days off - which we rarely have together in the first place because of our jobs being complete opposite shifts. UGH.

Then there's the whole school issue. I've already got a diploma from the most useless school on earth. I was second-best in the class and took an internship that took me nowhere, then I was unemployed for almost a year while joining activist hippie groups and generally hating my life. I wasted my time, took up smoking pot and hating ""the man"", was angry and bitter that my education somehow failed me. When I looked into the competition for my field I was blown away at how little I had been taught, how little education I felt I had received. And in $32K of student debt that I am still pushing aside because I'm living paycheck to paycheck. No way in hell I can afford monthly payments and probably won't be able to for awhile. Part of me wants a refresher course or a do-over but that costs money and right now I'm working full-time, minimum wage at a job that I like but is not related to my field whatsoever - I can't quit or even lessen my hours to go to school because then I can't make rent. I don't want to move back home with my parents because that's a full moving process which also costs money that I don't have.

I lost my driver's license while visiting family for Christmas (my parents scraped up some money to fly me out) - have no idea where the card is, but now I can't exchange my license for a new one in the province in which I currently reside. I have no idea what to do. I don't have a car (thank God because I would not be able to afford it) but I don't want to lose my license because it's nifty to have and I paid all that money for it back in the day. I have no valid form of government-issued photo ID (unless you can count an expired passport) so no bars for me. I try to avoid situations where I will get I.D'd because I don't have any. This rules out a lot of ways to start over socially with new people (bars &amp; nightlife are huge here).

Meanwhile my dog is snoring beside me (she is one of my only distractions from feeling shitty) and my boyfriend is at his lovely salaried job at a great place with great benefits and a gym and an on-site doctor and here I am feeling sorry for myself. I'm just... at the end of my rope... wishing I had some sort of direction. I have a huge problem with procrastination and also not knowing where to look for resources.

She is looking to spend many many months in the hospital recovering and going to rehab. The hospital where she is at is about two hours away from where I currently live. I plan on visiting her *at least* once a week.

For the past year my long term boyfriend and I have been discussing moving to Chicago when our lease expires at the end of June. Moving to Chicago has been a life long dream of mine, and finally everything seems to be falling into place. We've been applying for jobs and looking at apartments. The problem is that Chicago is farther away from the hospital, about 5-6 hours by car.

My entire family thinks I'm being selfish by continuing on with my plans to move to Chicago while my mom is in the hospital. My father suggested I move home to help take care of my mother when she gets out of the hospital, and my brother won't hardly talk to me because he thinks the same thing. My father said if I can't move home, I could at least move closer instead of moving father away. I know my mother, and I know she wouldn't want me to put my entire life on pause because of her injury. I assured my family I will be there as much as possible to visit and assist as much as I can. Right now my mom is unable to speak because she has a trach, otherwise I would love to talk to her about everything, to get her real feelings on the matter.

I feel awful because I obviously love my mom so much. She is literally, my best friend. We hung out a lot, went shopping, and did everything together. It devastated me when I heard she will probably be confined to a wheel chair for the rest of her life. But I'm trying to remain very optimistic. She still has good use of her upper body, she still is cognitive, and most importantly she's alive. And she's STRONG. When she get's out of the hospital I know she's going to want to be as independent as possible.

So is there something wrong with me??? Am I being selfish? Should I consider my father's request to move home or move closer? Chicago will always be there, but maybe my mom needs me right now? I know my family needs me, but I plan on visiting a lot. I'm not sure what else I should do. I'm so conflicted.

My past relashionships have all failed mostly because of my lack of desire in them and I sincerely don't want it to happen again. I love my boyfriend and I want to make him happy but this part of me is hard on him and I would hate myself forever if I loose him over sex.

What's wrong with me? Nothing turns me on. Unless he touches me then I'll get in the mood slowly but he want to feel desired too, I can understand that. I feel like he deserves better. Am I asexual or do I only have a very low libido? Again, what's wrong with me? He is hot, as an awesome body, he is gentle and always makes sure I get off too. He is just an awesome boyfriend and I feel like I am not giving him what he deserves and wants. I makes efforts but it's not enough and I'm afraid that my, what ever it is that makes me less sexualized, could drive him away like it did to my past relashionships.

We had a long-distance relashionship for a year before I moved with him, and I mean, across the country long-distance. We would skype and have regular intimate sessions online and I visited him for a couple of weeks before moving to him nine months later. In all, we have been together for almost two years. The firsts months here were amazing and sex was a regular thing where both sides openly showed desire but it has faded away to a once a month thing if I feel like it. We talked about it and I ended up in tears, he was so gentle, saying it could affect our relashionship and he told me how he felt, while always remaining calm. And I feel like such a jerk, here he was, explaining to me his feelings, so sweet and handsome and I couldn't even give him an answer. Should I just ignore that my body isn't turned on and initiate sex even if I don't feel like it? It would seem fake but it may make him feel desired. I would like to give him an answer as to why I am like this but I can't. Also, I use hormonal birth control and I have read that it can affect and considerably lower my libido.

I'm 26, soon to be 27 and I feel like my life is a complete waste. No worse than that, a burden to everyone around me, a betrayal of everything I ever believed in...


Until about a year ago I was completely unemployed, now I work only part-time at a dead end job I hate waking up at 4am to unload trucks. Before that I dropped out of college. I had a 4.0 before I just stopped doing the work completely. I honestly don't know why I did this.


I don't even make enough to pay rent and food. My parents still support me at this age. It's fucking beyond shameful. In spite of their admittedly gracious and voluntary support, I have huge issues with my entire family.


I hate how pathetically weak and absent my father was during my entire childhood, although I fully sympathize as to why he divorced my mother. His fatherly instruction was largely one of fake zen pacifism and moody pseudo-intellectual narcissism. Instead of teaching me to throw a punch or a football he told me that only brutes had to resort to such things. Every time I do something manly, sporting or even social, I feel like it's a learned skill I had to create solely through observing normal people. If I were to emulate my father, I'd play piano all day in a dark apartment with no friends while brooding over a bottle of gin on how superior I am to the rest of the human race.


My mother is honestly worse. She's a school principal and a PHD in psychology, and I've never met a more hurtful or meanspirited person in my entire life. We can be driving along and she will make fun of a complete stranger on the sidewalk, picking apart every trait they possess in an attempt to belittle and destroy them behind their back. If I say anything in response she will slam on the brakes and hold out her fist so that I accelerate into it. 


My entire childhood was dealing with this kind of abuse, usually with the dissection of psyche being my own for her amusement, but because she is such a figurehead of the community, outwardly fake-nice person and because she actually (in a sick hypocritical twist) reports other parents to Social Services she made sure to let me know that I ""would never be believed"" and that she knew ""exactly where the line of proof was"". I short, I feel like I have Hannibal Lector for a Mom. She can take any little piece of information and use it to damage you on the inside.


This is also why I have huge reservations about seeing a psychologist, I've had psychology applied to me in order to break me as human being. There's nothing quite like having the ""latest study"" quoted to you as proof of how worthless you are while you are freezing outside naked in the snow or having the phrases ""you don't deserve anything"" and ""you are selfish beyond belief"" repeated to you like a broken record for over a week without any other response when in private. She also had a habit for leaving me in places with no form of return transportation as punishment. I became afraid to go anywhere for fear of being left there for hours. I once spent a day in the company of a kind old janitor who let me watch his TV and drink pop, he saw through her bullshit when she came back at 10pm to get me and threatened to call the police on her. Ever since, I've learned to befriend the person with the most keys first. I guess I have learned some things in my life.


I hate being dependent on my family for all these reasons and more, yet feel helpless. Helpless to change myself. Helpless to relate to other people my age. Helpless to take control. I feel like it's a trained helplessness, like they get off on having me under their thumb. I know that I'm too old to feel like this and should have the resources at 26 to be independent and effect change, yet this poison has seeped into every facet of my existence.


My ""friends"" and women my age either walk all over me, or insist that I'm ""weird"". I know that in many respects I am. Yet have really tried to fit in, even taking extreme measures to do so.


I managed to get sent to boarding school for supposedly ""gifted"" kids. I fit in terribly there, but I knew that I had to get away from home after I tried to hang myself at age 13. The rope broke. My mother found me, but was mostly concerned with the humiliation it would have caused her at her job. I threatened that next time I would succeed unless I was sent away. I spent all my summers from then on either at the school or at Boy Scout camp. I actually ended up making Eagle Scout, but so far have only added that to the list of things in my life that I have reneged on or betrayed in principle.


I have terrible trust issues. Especially with women. The first girlfiend I ever had was in college. She ended up urinating on my clothing and leaving them outside in the snow to freeze. I guess I can pick them just as good as dear old dad. She was also a wiccan who believed in cursing people. I guess witchcraft wasn't enough, because she then submitted my phone number to a local sex shop so that gay men would call me looking for sex. I don't blame them. They felt terrible when they realized it was a prank. 


My major was in film and video, but so far every profesional partner I've had has taken advantage of me. Hell, my former best friend ended up keeping all the money and credit while referring angry clients to me and breaking my computer. I guess he knew he could get away with it.


I have met good people along the way. My scoutmaster was probably the closest thing to a father I can think of. He would be very disappointed in me however and the direction my life has taken. I also met a nice girl who was very religious on behalf of her nutjob parents. I stayed with her for three years, yet left in part because of frustration over lack of sex. We tried a couple of times, but it was always too painful for her. I later found out that she had vaginismus brought on by religious conditioning and anorexia. Now I feel like an absolute shitheel for having left her. She is however married now and happy I hope.


After splitting with her, I was was so sick of being a virgin that I ended up betraying every idea of decency, feminism and scout oath that I ever believed in and paid for sex with an escort. I tried to find one that didn't hate her job, but if I was being honest I'd say that I wasn't truly caring about another persons wellbeing. Now if anything I feel more shallow, like I lost something. I can't say that I'm a virgin, because I've had sex, but I still have no idea how to relate to women sexually. I'm just an asshole without principles.


Right now I'm sitting in an appartment covered with filth, addicted to World of Warcraft which might as well be World of Methcraft in the speed and dilligence it has in fucking up my life even more. Sometimes I wonder if it would have been preferable if my addiction was a physical drug. People might take me seriously and I could get rehab. 


I know that I just wrote a fucking epic cry post on the internet. I don't know what else to do. I thought that I would have died by now in so many ways, I was counting on it you could say.


I recently came to that realization, that life doesn't end when it's conveient, when we've given up. It continues anyhow. that knowledge terrifies me more than the prospect of death, but I'm not suicidal. I've already been on the end of that rope. I'm scared of continuing on like this.

Hello reddit. Throwaway since my friend is a redditor.

I have a friend who has had a rough life. One of the worst situations I have ever heard of which I can't get into details about. We've been friends for about 12 years.

His parents bailed on him and since high school he has basically just been couch surfing with our old high school friends and then living with the mom of one of our friends up until about a year ago.

He has no money, can't drive, has health issues, is depressed, and hasn't been able to catch a break. My wife and I decided that maybe we had the ability to be a lucky break for him. So we invited him to live with us at no cost and he wouldn't have to pay us back provided he try and find a job and do whatever he could to improve his situation.

We bought him a bed, clothes, food, provided him with his own room, his own bathroom, a laptop, an internet connection, a prepaid phone, and we hooked him up with a social worker in our county after he could be considered a resident of our state.

We also set him up with health insurance for the first time and he also was able to start seeing a counselor/therapist.

We had hoped all of this would give him the opportunity to finally break out of his situation. This is where it gets bad.

In a year he hasn't so much as gotten an interview. He received one phone call regarding something that didn't turn out to even be a real job offer. He spends most of his days playing League of Legends, watching Netflix, or talking to his gamer buddies that he met online.

Now my wife and I would like to buy a house but we can't save enough for a down payment and closing costs because we've sunk about $11k into providing for our friend.

Now our lease is coming up and we would like to move out to a 1 bedroom that is much cheaper than it is in our current apartment so that we can save for our house. But what happens to him? He has no where to go. We can't talk to him because he just shuts down, hides in his room, or gets mad. I don't want to just bail on him because he's still a very good friend.

I feel like I've done everything I can but I can't even get feedback from him because he refuses to talk about anything serious. What do I do reddit?

TLDR: Took care of every need and then some for a friend for 12 months, we want to move, he hasn't done a single thing to take care of himself, and he has no where to go. What do I do?

1364827421.0,8,self.ihaveissues,1bfa7x,my [30m] relationship is likely over [30f] and i cant deal with it,throwaway20130401,8,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1bfa7x/my_30m_relationship_is_likely_over_30f_and_i_cant/,"i don't know what else to do with myself right now...

i've been in a relationship for a couple of years now.. we were friends first for a couple of years before that, and the best friend thing boiled over into a fully fledged relationship. I always wanted this to happen, and i guess i got what i wanted in the end.

The past couple of years have had their ups and downs.. the ups have been amazing. i've never opened myself up to someone as i have with her, and well, i can honestly say i lover her with all my heart and i actually am confident that she feels the same. I've never had this before. this isn't puppy love crap, i'm a grown adult and my twenties are in my past.

The downs.. well there's been a few of them but they've been recurring themes.

when I met her, i wasn't in the best place. like career wise, financially etc. and this is something that's always been important to her, as she wants to settle down, have kids, all that stuff that i want too. she's done great for herself with very little help to say the least, and i guess the least she could expect is someone to at least have done what she's done so the marriage i set up from both sides..

problem is i wasn't quite there.

I sorta messed up through high school and took the long route to uni, so didn't start uni til i was about 21 (instead of the normal 18) and didnt finish til i was about 25 (instead of the normal 21). so i was always 3-4 years behind other acheivers my age as a result of this.. but.. low and behold, i went to uni, and i pretty much met her about a year after i finished. i was on a grad wage back then, so needless to say this position wasn't hugely impressive when shes the same age as me but had been working for 4-5 years.

to add fuel to the fire, my family isn't really in a position to help.. though they've done what they can in some ways financially, in other ways, non financial, they've been a huge burden.

anyways in the time that ive known her, i've improved my situation a lot. my salary has more than doubled, i now own a home (well the bank does anyway), albeit with pretty much 0 equity. That's all well and good, except we aren't really in a position to marry.

culturally, there's a lot of pressure on her from her family, so waiting around isn't really an option. doing the whole bf/gf thing doesn't work, as her family now know about us.

i don't even know how to sum up everything into where i'm at now, but basically, throughout the journey, ive taken out some loans. we're talking a sizable some, to the point where the bank won't give me any more loans. i haven't blown it at the casino or on booze or anything like that. most of it has gone to constructive things. ie. work that needed to be done on the house, furnishings, etc.

only problem is now there's pretty much nothing left, and on top of that i built a bit of a credit card debt. im in a pickle basically. if it is up to me to manage by myself, i'll be able to keep the ship afloat, but when we start talking about marriage, wedding, honeymoon, kids etc - well it ain't looking great.
i've asked my parents for help, probably one too many times, as they've been stretched.. and well.. they came to the party though not in the way i would have liked, which i can totally understand.. they helped me out with my credit card debt but i have to repay them monthly (nowhere near what i'd have to pay normally to work the credit card debt).

that solves that problem, but i'm still in the position where i can't really make things happen.

i have some stocks that i can sell, but then we'll be in a position where we've scraped together enough funds to get married, and maybe have a honeymoon, but then we're starting our life in massive debt. this stresses her out in a big way.. and fuck - you cant blame her.

the main part of the debt problem is a period of about 3-4 months when i took out the money. we sort of discussed it, and what it was for etc. and i guess somewhere along the lines communication channels got broken, as we were dealing with some issues on her behalf that i was supporting her through. but this was happening at the same time as a house settlement, furnishings, etc.. there were a shit load of outgoings and i lost track of it all.. i fucked up.
to add fuel to the fire, she had a previous relationship break down, and that guy has been a serial pest in trying to get her back. it hasn't stopped in the time i've known her (both before the r/s and after). I've respected the situation and tried to stay out of it, as it involved her family etc.. for a while she had cut all ties, but i know in the past few weeks they've spoken briefly a couple of times and it's driving me insane. i feel like becoming one of those crazy bf's that keeps tabs on her, but know that'd just be fucked up.

so now, im basically at the point where my finances are pretty much at the point where it is what it is, and not much can be done apart from working my way out of this mess. but i think she's had enough. i think she's gone - and i cant handle it. my life has been about her for the past 4 years - even before we were in a relationship - and shes my best friend and i've been hers and nowshe might be gone. i dont know what to do with myself. shes the only person i ever speak to - i have mates but i don't keep in touch with them that much... they all know about her and know about us and know how i feel about her and i wouldnt even be able to face them as i know i'll be getting their sympathy, which i don't really want.. i actually have trouble imagining life without her - i'll have to rebuild myself, both financially but also mentally, emotionally, socially, and i just don't have the energy for that. i dont have the energy to even think about finding someone else, yet i can't stand the thought of being alone. i really dont know what to do with myself, the void that her absence will leave behind simply won't be filled. i feel that, whilst i know everyone says this after a relationship, that i will never find someone like this. i might end up one day settling for someone that i half love, but it will never be like what i have now and that depresses the fuck out of me. whilst im not suicidal or anything like that, i feel im going to have this whole ""what's the fucken point"" attitude to life, and yeah, i will probably be depressed.

i dont know what the question is here.. i guess i just need advice.. maybe someone to reassure me that all is not doomed.... i just dont know what i want from here really..
TL;DR: i think my relationships pretty much over - breaking down how it fell apart, mostly financial issues - am having trouble coping and dont know how i will ever be able to move on.

Here: have a story",I_Use_Throwaways,8,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1av6go/after_quantico_shootings_ex_texts_me_20m_here/,"Hi, I'm an asshole. On a separate note, I appologize in advance for changing tenses.


There's a long version of the story and a significantly longer version. This is the (less) long version. Don't worry, the story isn't as interesting as the title may make it seem.




At the time I was graduating high school, (FL Tampa Bay area in 2011) I worked 60 hours a week. I would go to school, have 2 hours of free time (an hour of which was driving) that I'd spend with my girlfriend (lets call her H) at the time, then go to work, get off at midnight or so, and get 6 hours of sleep. 



H was perfect. My dream come true. We had classes together throughout highschool, and dated almost all of Senior year. H was from a well off family with no siblings, never had a real boyfriend before me, beautiful, sweet, Christmas birthday, graduated valedictorian, and went off to UF for BioChemical Engineering.



We had a great relationship. We rarely argued and never yelled at each other. I loved {I paused far too long before typing that ""d""} her, she loved me. In school I had multiple classes with her, and while I was working we'd text often. She wanted to wait until marriage for sex, and I tried not to push it on her. I'd do anything for her. {More happens in this time, that is omitable}



I proposed to H and she said she wanted to wait.



I had a thing about lying and wouldn't even tell a tiny white lie. I lied to everyone I knew and said I didn't get into any college. I enlisted in the Marine Corps for a 5 year active duty contract a month before graduating high school, and shipped for Parris Island in the middle of July. {More happens in this time, that is omitable}



Three months of bootcamp, I got exactly one letter a week from H. It was unlined paper, filled exactly to the end of the page with the same size handwritten font, trimmed on the outside with random drawings. Each one had the same basic questions and random things that happened. Towards the end of bootcamp I get a letter saying she wasn't coming to my graduation (Oct 14th) because she had an exam.



A U.S. Marine now, back in Florida on leave for 10 days, I drive up to see her in college nearly every day, but it felt like she didn't care anymore. Like something changed and I couldn't figure it out. On my 8th day of leave I find out my recruiter got me two weeks of Recruiter's Assistance (RA) so I could stay in the area for a bit longer before I leave for Marine Combat Training (MCT). Just about every day I worked 10 hours in the recuiting office and drove up to see her. Did I say this was over a 2 hour drive? Still seemed like something was bothering her.



Three days before I leave for MCT I give up, convinced she is going to break up with me. I decided to go on a date with the attractive female Marine who was on RA with me and had been trying to get with me since before I left for bootcamp. We go out, end up making out in my car, a little touching, and I stop. I drop her back off at her house. I can't go through with cheating on H, even if she was about to break up with me.



Next day I go up to see her, we hang out as usual. Still something off. Getting late, I get a hotel room to stay the night before I leave the next day for a month. H wants to stay with me (we'd never slept with eachother before). Fast forward a couple hours and we are both naked in bed together making out, progressing further and further. I didn't bring a condom because I wasn't expecting any of this. No sex because of that alone. We wake up the next day, get dressed, eat breakfast, and I tell her I went out with that other girl the night before last. She tells me to leave after, and I beg for forgiveness. I leave and she breaks up with me via text.



At MCT, and just to see if I could, I convinced three of the females in my platoon that they loved me. I promised that I would be with them after MCT, which was a bullshit lie. {More happens in this time, that is omitable}



I graduate from MCT Dec 6th and get orders to Pensacola, FL (still 5 hours from H and 7 from home) for 5 months. I decide to drive home for the Christmas weekend, and post it on Facebook. I get home Dec 23rd and get a text at around midnight from H. I drive through the middle of the night so see her, and we spend the night together. We get back together. I made a point to drive and see her every chance I got.



Fast forward to MLK day weekend when I was in Gainesville (the place where UF is) with H. We spend the night together and we end up having sex in the middle of the night. Morning after pill. {More happens in this time, that is omitable}



I drive back to Pensacola and begin feeling extremely guilty for the entire situation of the weekend before. I felt like I raped her, though I really didn't. I just kept thinking about it and stressing myself out. I broke up with H that Friday. I just wanted the thoughts to go away. They didn't.



After a month we got back together again, followed shortly by us breaking up, back together, broke up again, back together. {A shit ton more happened here, but for legal purposes I'm omitting}



At the beginning of May 2012 I decided to take 10 days of leave between Pensacola and my next orders to Quantico. I spend every day with H. All is well for the first time in months. Now, Quantico (just south of Washington, D.C.) is a bit more than a couple hours drive from Gainesville, FL, so I couldn't see H any time I wanted. I could afford to fly H up to visit once a month. H supported this idea at first, but after a couple weeks didn't want to fly up anymore. This eventually caused us to break up again, though I still wanted to be with her.



I took leave again in August to have lunch with H on, what would have been, our aniversery. So, I flew home, borrowed a car, drove a couple hours, and had lunch with H. Then we went back to her dorm and watched some shitty horror movie, and talked for hours. She said something to the affect of ""you can't just come back here and act like everything is how it used to be."" The last thing I said to her was ""happy anniversery H.""



I finally resolved it would never work out between us. I don't even remember what happened the other four days of that leave. I don't remember the trip back to Quantico. I got extremely depressed until November.



I was sitting in the barracks one night and I decided I needed to go out, so I did. Between then and January '13 I ended up sleeping with a dozen women from Virginia to Maryland (including D.C.) most of which were one night stands. I blew all of my money, baught a new car, new computer, etc. Still every day I think about H. 



I got better about thinking about H every day. It got to about every other, then eventually only when something reminded me of her. I still can't go in bookstores, jewelry stores, malls, or listen to piano. I couldn't talk to anyone on Christmas.



So two nights ago there were 3 active duty Marines killed (well, 2 murders and a suicide). When I woke up this morning I saw H texted me last night while I was sleeping asking if I was alright. I responded ""yes, I'm alright. Thank you."" ""I wasn't expecting to hear from you again"" then I headed into work five hours ago because I had to. I still don't know if she has messaged me again. I can't have my phone in the building. I get off shift in another seven hours.

So I think at least some of my issues come from my parents. they have been married for a long time, but they can't stand each other, and told me since I was little that they are only together for financial reasons.

I think about my past (in general) a LOT. I always consider alternative universes where if I had done something differently, life would be like _____. This isn't a one-time thing, but an ongoing problem I have. This story is just a recent example I want to share.

This ex-boyfriend in particular has an interesting story. He and I started dating (junior year in high school) and then he broke up with me to go out with my best friend. They dated for a few months over the summer and then classes started again. He and I had 3 out of 4 classes together all year. They broke up, we reconnected, and he confessed his love to me (great story, but for another time). Happily ever after, right? The problem was, I had started dating someone else. We weren't serious, but I couldn't justify breaking up with new-boyfriend just for ex-boyfriend. So I silently made my (in)decision, and ex-boyfriend basically iced me for the rest of the school year. Eventually, he started dating another girl and we drifted apart even further.

Fast forward 6 years later, I haven't talked to him since high school, and he's still dating the same girl. I log onto Facebook and see a mutual friend posted an exciting status like, ""OMG Finally!"" and tagged the couple. I knew it could only mean one thing... I went on the girl's profile and yes. They got engaged. Commence breakdown. I am not in contact with him and I have since blocked her from Facebook so I am not tempted / do not have to see the gag reflex-inducing updates about their nuptials. 

I look at my life and I'm pretty happy. I have a great job living in a decent place and a wonderful puppy and boyfriend. I can't imagine myself giving up what I have... except for maybe 'him'. But now I'll never have that opportunity. It feels like the ultimate failure on my part and I am so upset. I always think about how if I had just broken up with the 'new-boyfriend' from high school that I could still be with ex-boyfriend, living my dream life (he's in the state I want to live, he's gorgeous, shares many of my same interests and values, etc.) but NOOO... it gets to be HER. Not me, her. And I HATE it.

It's stupid, I know it is, but I just don't know how to stop feeling this way. 

TL;DR: I have a hard time letting go of things, and it means spending a lot of my idle time dwelling in the past... including reminiscing about ex-boyfriends and ""what if"". It's stupid.

[24f, 25m]",littleshoes,9,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/19b166/give_me_a_reality_check_am_i_being_taken_for/,"I (24f) have been dating my bf (25m) for about 4.5 years. We've had some rough times in the past including infidelity on my part and general asshole behavior on his. We've broken up three times but have always kept talking. We communicate well with each other for the most part but I can't shake this feeling that we should have never gotten back together. I have been struggling with severe depression for the last 14 years. It's hard for me to figure out my real feelings about the relationship when I'm depressed because every feeling is so intense. When I talk to my bf about it, he says that I am pitying myself and stressing about things that are out of my control (i.e. the future). 

The main issue for me right now is that I feel taken for granted. A few months ago I asked him for one date per week (very loose definition of date, basically just spend time with me without the TV on). He never outright agreed. He talks about feeling social pressure from friends and coworkers to spend time with them and he makes a genuine effort to see them. I feel that because we live together he doesn't feel the need to make this effort to see me. I don't have many friends and my closest friends recently moved to South America so I'm always at home after work.

At the moment, his job is taking a lot of his time. I understand the importance of his job at this point in his life, but after his late hours at the office he spends the rest of the evening with his coworkers, drinking in swanky downtown bars (he spent the night at his downtown office on Friday because he was too drunk to drive home). On Saturday I was very close to committing suicide by overdosing. He wasn't around that night because he was spending the night at his friend's house. My almost suicide was not because he wasn't home but due to my own inability to overcome depressive feelings for the past 14 years. I told him about my almost OD while we were in bed on Sunday night. His reaction caught me off guard. I expected him to be supportive and reassuring, to tell me that he loves me and that I deserve better than suicide. Instead his reaction was defensive and angry. We were cuddling and he separated from me while he started talking about my self pity and allowing myself to spiral down to that degree. I corrected him and told him that I did not have a ""pity party"" as he said but instead reached out to reddit for help and distraction. I told him about the other things that I've been doing to help myself fight the depression. His response was a simple ""Well that's good."" 

I tried talking to him about my feelings regarding the relationship. I told him it feels like the relationship has an expiration date and that maybe if we treated it as such we could have a better time for now. He said that he always treats it as such because he doesn't know where our futures will take us. He reminded me that we had previously agreed to focus on the present in our relationship without stressing about the future. I told him I felt that he doesn't focus on the present with our relationship and that I feel he takes me for granted when he chooses to spend all of his available time with his friends without making an effort to do something outside of the house with me. He didn't really respond to this. I told him that part of my trying to fight my depression is when I ask him to do things with me, whether on our own or with friends, but that he always says no. Again, no real response. He said he doesn't want me to be co-dependent.

On Sunday my mom sent me a coupon for a fancy downtown restaurant and said I should use her credit card to go on a date with my bf. I talked to him about it and we mentioned doing it tonight, Tuesday, but didn't make any permanent plans. When I was driving home from work I called him and again we talked about doing the dinner tonight. When I got home 30 min later I texted him to see if it was really going to happen. He said that his friend/coworker is going through something right now and is ""opening up"" to him tonight. He said he'd rather set a night just for the two of us just like he did for him and his friend tonight (which he had done just 30 min before - also this is the same friend he partied with all night on Friday). I asked him when that will be and he said he'll have to look at his schedule when he gets home tonight (whenever that is). I thought that he would remember that I almost killed myself this weekend and think that maybe I want to ""open up"" to him, too. 

[Also, he owes me $1500 in rent/house bills and that's just since I started keeping an ""invoice"" in August. I previously paid all of our bills while he was unemployed (and got money from his mom for pot).]

So, I'm looking for a reality check. I talked to my friends about it but I think my close relationship with them may have biased their advice for me to leave my bf. Am I being taken advantage of? Taken for granted? Is there anything to this relationship other than history?

**tl;dr** I'm a depressive person and can't figure out what's really going on in my relationship.

Basically, I had some issues with my girlfriend sending inappropriate texts/pictures to her ex after she had broken up with him, but before we were ""officially"" together.  We had been dating for a couple of months when this happened, and I suppose I foolishly assumed she wasn't in contact with her ex during this time.  I was wrong, however, and she was still sending her ex nude pictures while we were dating.  

I found out about this months later, once we were already living together.  She told me she was very confused during that time, that she didn't consider our relationship ""official,"" and that she felt really bad for her ex after breaking up with him and didn't want him to be lonely (he's in the military).  

I felt betrayed because I had considered our relationship ""official"" when she sent those pictures.  Still, I understood that these feelings were the result of my own foolish assumption and proceeded to move on and start fresh.  

But it's been over a year now since that happened, and I still can't seem to get over this.  If you read my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1916m2/so_26f_getting_romantic_texts_from_her_platonic/) in r/relationships, you'll see that I'm still very paranoid about guys texting her or her deleting her sent messages.

Without sounding conceited, I guess I'm pretty and a lot of people are attracted to me off the bat. I feel like at best though, I can make small-to-medium talk with a lot of people. The more I see someone the less I feel I can talk about. I feel like when it comes to talking really intimately with people, I can't talk intimately about anything but myself, or that person.

For instance, I've been dating someone [M22] for almost a month, and when we talk, it's like we're just exchanging cool stories and nothing more than that. Last night we went to a large party with a bunch of our mutual and separate friends, and while I had no problem talking with strangers and with my friends, any time my current boyfriend and I were alone together, I couldn't think of anything to say, no cool stories, and we would just stand there really awkwardly. One of his friends thought we were fighting...

When I did speak up, it was always really private, introspective stuff that I probably shouldn't have shared at that time.

Like, when you see two people talking quietly together, what are they talking about?? I feel like they're not talking about Superjail or the most recent scientific discovery, I feel like it's more intimate than that, but I also doubt that they're divulging their most private anxieties.

It doesn't help that often when someone makes an interesting remark, instead of responding my mind does this: thinks about the thing mentioned for a second, and then from that subject races on to other things related to it, or starts to think about the subject in hypothetical situations. When that happens rather than just making some kind of coherent response about the subject, I'm privately racing away thinking about it to myself, and then never really responding, or just going ""Hmm"" and leaving it at that.

TL;DR: I feel like I can't get really close to anyone. Beyond a superficial level, I get stuck in my head and can't properly communicate. My mind is usually racing from one thing to the next during a conversation, or else just goes blank. I don't know if I'm introverted or extroverted. I feel like I'll never have a functional, normal romantic relationship. I feel like I'm really deficient somewhere. I'm seriously doubting my interpersonal skills. I have been for like 3 years now.

I'm 35 and a guy. I spend all day lamenting my lack of sex. I feel completely unwanted and socially inept, contrary to the evidence. I got my first gf (and first sex) when I was 27. That lasted 7 years and was largely sexless, though not completely so. I broke up with her after I started getting expensive erotic massages and it made me feel like I've been denying myself a satisfying sex life. In the year and a half since then I've had sex with 3 women (a six month dating, a NSA from craigslist, and a two-dater from okcupid), so obviously I'm not completely hideous but I feel completely the opposite.

Addendum: I remembered a 4th woman sex partner. An escort. Lah-di-dah.

I'm on antidepressants (initially for ocd) and I see a psychologist. He said something about how I talk about wanting sex but that if that's really what I wanted I could just hire escorts, so I must want something more. This is true. I want someone to snuggle with in bed and all that shit. But that's nothing a pro couldn't do if I paid her. 

I have only ever had success with women I've online. That is not true. When I was 19 I met a girl that was obviously (looking back, at least) trying to seduce me but I was oblivious (um, head on my lap sucking on my fingers? hello!). A more recent example is someone I met here on r4r. We had lunch one day, then the next day she took an hour-long bus ride to meet me for dinner. More subtle than sucking on my fingers, but obviously (looking back) a sign of interest to which I was oblivious. Or perhaps afraid to advance on.

Since breaking up with my first gf I have vastly increased my social life. I made a bunch of new friends on meetup.com and go out often for karaoke, boardgames, and improv. In december I went to a couple christmas parties and a couple new years parties by myself, met people and had a lot of fun, but nothing came of it. I tried to stay in touch with some women that I danced with and shit, but get nothing in return. That's not true. One girl responded to my text messages, but I was really only texting her out of desperation. I know she's not for me. I had tried to kiss her, got denied, she pointed at her cross necklace. Also she laughed at me when I told her I live with my mom. Why did I even stick around? Desperation.

I've given oral to a man twice since the gf, and enjoyed it (via craigslist and grindr). I have no doubt that I prefer women, but I accept that I may be bi (but not homo-romantic). Several times I have posted (using alts) on /r/randomactsofblowjob looking to give, and got numbers and made plans, only to back out at the last second. I tell myself it's because I'm paranoid of disease. Perhaps I am too paranoid? I also tell myself that if I had a friend that was interested I'd be more likely to follow through. I also tell myself that if I was seduced or whatever, I'd be down. I have this desire to be a worthless cum target for a group of men. I think there's something here about feeling so desperate, and knowing that generally men are easier to get than women, and would be an easier path toward sexual gratification of any kind.

Like I said, I'm not a virgin, but at 35 I feel very inexperienced for my age. The sex with my gf was rare, and the sex with my more recent 6 month friend was just crap. She was way more experienced than me, and knew exactly how she wanted it. Also she seemed to have this strong idea of gender roles and foreplay progression that I wasn't able to fulfill, and since I was so concentrated on that I couldn't maintain an erection. So I feel like a virgin or something. I don't know what that means. Scared? Incompetent?

I have issues.  i have alot of health problems. They're fixed now, but... i've had alot of things wrong with me. I've barely escaped death 3 times.

When i was a freshmen, my best friend isolated me from everyone else. She abused me, sexually, physically, and mentally. She'd give me the silent treatment for days, and treat me like crap. She made me do things i didn't want to do. I never noticed because it was put in increments. When i look back now, i feel stupid for not realizing it. It just happened... And Soon she got a boyfriend, but continued to make me do sexual things with her. when i began to start saying no to things i didn't want to do, or i knew weren't right, she decided we weren't friends. But it didn't stop. She still had me isolated, by spreading rumors to keep people from talking to me. She and some other people tortured and bullied me. They'd beat me up, and threaten to kill me.I developed an eating disorder, even though i was already skinny to begin with. I would get too scared of them and wouldn't be able to eat. I became very ill, ended up in the hospital, and had to go to therapy to eat. Even now, when i'm upset i can't eat. 

My boyfriend after that cheated on me for our entire relationship with his ex. He made me hate myself for thinking he was, and made me feel bad, when he really was. It drove me mad for an entire year.

Two guys used me and lead me on, just to get over their ex or get revenge on someone else. One raped me. 
 
My next boyfriend (just dumped a few days ago) lied that he was seeing other women, and when we got together, he cheated and left me for his ex. We got back together, and then shortly left me for his ex's best friend. we got back together, and he cheated on me with a different ex. We got back together, (in the process i got an STI, that i had to treat and its gone now) and he just recently left me for his ex girlfriend again. Yippee.  I realize now, he was just using me to replace his ex until she wanted him back. (in which she was just using him when she didn't have someone else.) 13 months, and i was used. 

I'm really fucked up. I'm barely 18. 

I feel like no matter how hard i try, or how hard i work to be the best i can, i always get treated the same...I always get left for the ex girlfriend, and they always fuck up my relationships. I realize i can't always blame the third party, but i'm SERIOUS! we're fine, then the ex just RANDOMLY decides to come along because she suddenly becomes single...I have zero confidence now, and the only thing keeping me from committing suicide is the fact that it'd hurt my family, and i know it's not the right thing to do. 

I no longer find myself attractive, no matter how much makeup i put on, or how expensive my clothes are. I feel like that's where i lose. I'm rich, i'm smart, i attend a good university, i'm skinny, i'm talented in music and art, and I've been told i have a golden heart. I've never purposely hurt anyone, unless i'm hurt myself, and then i just blow up and start saying painful things. Nothing like lies or insulting, but just saying how much it hurts, and how mean they are for treating me like this. I've never actually gone and betrayed a friend, or cheating on anyone, or bullied someone. I've been through it all, and i know how much pain that is...

I'm depressed. I hate myself. I had everyone. I tell my mom, and she believes if she buys me whatever I want, it'll fix it. But it doesn't help. It makes me happy for a few hours, then i'm sad again. Then she thinks i'm so selfish because i'm not happy with the things i have. I am! i swear. But having all these things doesn't make me happy. I want to be happy, love myself, and be surrounded by wonderful people who care. And find someone who loves me for me. But my insecurities are eating me up, and i guess that attracts the wrong type of guys who only care to use me for a small bit of satisfaction.

Also I had problems with being bullied and two of my best friends died by the time I graduated high school, which just made me feel more alone and depressed.

I am neither drunk not raged while I write this. Just trying to get some fresh perspective as I feel I may be too biased about myself.I apologize in advance for the long thread and though it is nowhere near my entire life history, I feel I need to give you some context. So, grab a beer, or popcorn, and let's begin....

So here' the tl; part of it
28 yr old Indian male. I come from a fairly liberal family and even though my father came from an impoverished background, he made sure that my sibling and I got the best education possible. By the best-education possible, I mean I studied in arguably one of the nation's best schools and the few years I spent there have shaped to a large extent of what I am today and I am proud of it.

Though I was never a brilliant student, a few months out of college, I managed to land a job in a company which is a world leader in its field with a salary that most of my friends would enviable of. Three years later, I quit my job to pursue my grad studies in the US. I have been in the US since 2008 and although I have had my share of disappointments, I am mostly a content person. I have never had to worry about money as I earn quite well or atleast well enough to keep me happy and do sometimes hear from my friends that I am reckless in my spending.

I realize that as with any other ethnicity/gender/nationality there are pre-conceived notions/prejudices/stereotypes and I try my best to clear any such misconceptions. I am not trying to act 'American', but in all the years I've been in the US, I've had very few Indian friends. I mix freely with people of all nationality, ethnicity and gender so there my background has never held me back from being friendly to anyone.

The things that has been a bit more disappointing, and is the main subject of this post is my love-life, or lack thereof. Now, considering the perception about people who work in the technology field; being too geeky, socially ackward, etc. irrespective of gender, I am a fairly outgoing person. I may be a bit laconic at time, but I am no miser with words. In-fact I'm a sales consultant so I am definitely not a person stuck to his computer screen in some corner cubicle all day or living in my mom's basement. As Humpty Dumpty says in 'Alice in Wonderland', ""When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.""

Now, before I see suggestions along the lines of 1. Going to a meetup, getting to know people 2. Joining a sports league 3. Pursuing a hobby 4. Dating sites
let me give you some more information.

Though I'd spend 6-8 hrs in a weekend playing games on my Xbox, these long session are far in-between and although I am not a party animal, I do enjoy going to parties once in a while and enjoy meeting people. I bike fairly regularly, read daily and play in two sports leagues. I help organize and take-part in charity events and in August, me any my friends raised $2500 for the school district I live in. I help organize several meetups every month and meet people from different countries and backgrounds.

I consider myself to have good tastes, in movies, books, music, fashion and even though I'm a skinny guy weighing 130lbs, I do pay attention to my grooming, not too much, but I'm presentable and care how I dress.

So, considering all that I've told so far, I really shouldn't have much trouble meeting a girl I could connect with, right? Now, that you see ladies and gentlemen, is the problem. I am not choosy, but I am not too liberal either. I don't strike up a conversation with a woman with an intention of sleeping with her, I've tried that in my early 20s and know better now. I am not that guy who gets friend-zoned always, though I've been friend-zoned a couple of times. I have quite a few lady-friends and I've always treated them with respect.

I am also not that guy who pretends to be a girl's friend waiting to chance upon an opportunity, I just dislike it. I know darn well when to keep my fly zipped. I've had female roommates so there is definitely no awkwardness in interacting with women. I have never hurt a woman, the only time was when I slapped one of my closest freind who was trying to cut herself with a knife because some guy tried to sexually assualt her. I have helped my friends mend their relationships but somehow have always ended up being single.

Normally, as per the adivise of my friends, who know my situation, I have always felt that there will be a time and moment when I will find that special person but the past couple of weeks have been a bit concerning of and a time of bit of self-doubt. First, one of my closest friends who had abhorred being in a relationship got hitched. He is madly in love and plans to get married next year. Second, as I was speaking to my other friend, he asked me if I was ok. I don't have the faintest clue on why he got that impression, but I did not sound nowhere near being depressed or sad when I was talking about my friend who got hitched.
Before I become overwhelmed my cynicism, of maybe I am already being sucked into it, I should do some course-correction.

I've been on dating sites with almost no success, especially OKC. I take the effort to read through a person's profile and striking up a thoughful conversation with a girl I find genuinely interesting but never get a response. The few dates that I've been on makes me feel as if almost everyone lies. I know, you could say that same about me, maybe it's true but my friends who have read my profile and who wouldn't mind throwing in an honest opinion haven't found anything deceiving about it. Yet, irrespective of no-preference for race, colour, ethnicity, I've never managed to find a girl I could be in a relationship with.

Clearly, I am missing something.

As an example, about a year ago, I fell head-over-heels for this girl I worked with. At the end of the summer, I found out she had a crush on me too, but then she went back to school before we could really do anything. After she was back at school, we messaged back and forth a few times, but even though I wanted nothing more than to keep in touch with her and try to make something work, I never responded to the last message she sent me (which was asking if I wanted to skype). A week or so went by, and then two weeks. The whole time I kept feeling worse and worse that I never responded and I didn't know why I was letting it go so long. Well we never talked again. Part of me got some kind of sick thrill from this though. Just seeing myself be so destructively passive by never responding somehow fed some twisted desire. With every day that passed, I felt worse, but that desire was also fed a little more. I honestly don't know what my motivation was for this, but it was a very strong emotional thing and it felt very dark. And I was devastated because I was really into her. And I missed her. I remember wanting so badly to just type ""I'm so sorry I didn't respond sooner, but I really miss you"", but I just couldn't even do it. I became depressed and withdrawn for about 8 months after this, and I still really miss her every now and then.

I've done the same type of thing in so many different areas of my life. Usually they don't involve romance, but are just with random people. For instance, I'll get cards and gifts from relatives for christmas, and then I'll keep putting off thanking them. A few weeks go by and I start thinking ""oh no, I'm letting it happen again. why??"" and then a few MONTHS go by. The whole while, I'm feeling guilty as hell for not thanking them (sometimes these are pretty expensive gifts), but at the same time I'm getting some weird thrill from it. I don't understand it. I usually do end up just forcing myself to thank them eventually, but it's always weird because it's been like 4 months at that point.


Another example - about two months ago, I sat down with a friend of the family who helps people with their careers (I'm currently jobless). He was really eager to help me, all for free. In the meeting, I was all gung-ho about our plan, and left saying I would definitely follow-up on the minimal amount of homework he gave me. Well I never did. He emailed me twice asking me how things were going and I never responded. And it's not like I just saw the email and said ""delete"" and moved on. Oh no, that email lingered on my mind for weeks. Every morning I would wake up and think ""ok, just email him today. it's been a ridiculous amount of time, but you can still just apologize and get back on track"" And then I would spend most of the day procrastinating. I would go to bed and my eyes would shoot open just before I fell alseep and I would think ""what the FUCK? why would I let two weeks go by and not email him back? besides sabotaging myself, it's just rude. what is wrong with me?""

Actually come to think of it, the very fact that I'm jobless is due to this exact same destructive passiveness as well. I've been out of school for 6 months and I haven't put an application in ANYWHERE. I'm just sitting at home. And I'm getting the same kind of twisted feelings from this as I get from all the other examples I've listed. I want a job, but part of me feels almost hypnotized by how enthralling it is to push the passiveness as far as I can.

I just see no way it's going to happen anytime soon and I only have 1-2 more years here.  Math major here and it's slim pickings for girls.

I just feel like I'm going through the motions of college when everyone says it's the best time of your life.  I wake up, go to class, go to the gym, and go home.  On weekends I do hang out with friends but it's not satisfying.  I played intramural volleyball but nothing came of it.

Why is it that the only girls who like me are ones I would rather not date?  Three of these girls and counting.  


Yeah I can try online dating when I'm 30 and meet a single mom with 2 kids and try to be happy, but does that sound fun?  It just sounds depressing.

My roommate has a nice girl and sometimes I get pretty jealous, and it really comes between us.  I close my door and go for weeks without talking to him (because when she's over, I just get so jealous).  I should probably mention that she was the first girl I really liked in my life and I was pretty sad when my roommate started going out with her.  But I think I'm over it.  Not sure.

I pride myself on being a logical person.  I'm really confused if this is logic or emotion speaking to me.  I know I just need to find things that make me happy and love myself first, but it's so hard when there's this constant pressure of finding young, innocent, sweet love.

I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I'm going through at the hands of this jerk. My friends have been very supportive. Thanks for the support, y'all.

I was raped twice in my lifetime before this, neither of which I reported, but this time is different.

I thought I was just drunk, but I had eaten before I drank and I hadn't drank very much. Normally I drink hard liquor for hours at a time, and don't get drunk or lose control of myself. I should've known something was up when my first beer made me feel funny.

I don't remember how I got into bed. I had slept next to him before--I know this guy, my friends know this guy, I thought it was safe. I kept my clothes on. In the morning I felt too sick to move, and I hadn't even drank enough to get a hangover. Then he pulled off my clothes and did what he did.

I felt sick the rest of the day, like no hangover I had ever had before. My blood was humming in my ears all day. My heart was racing, but my blood pressure felt really low. I took my anxiety medication and it did nothing for my racing heart. I did my deep-breathing exercises. I drank water. Nothing helped how sick I felt. I just drifted in and out of sleeping and crying. I called my mother because I was so scared and sick. That feeling lasted off and on into the next evening. 

The next day at my internship, someone brought up the name of the place where the guy works, and I almost started crying. I broke down and told her about it so she'd at least understand why I was so upset at the mention of this place.

For the next couple of weeks I kept having flashbacks. I couldn't even touch myself without feeling the onset of a panic attack. I told my doctor, who gave me more medication, and I started feeling a little better, even if therapy was only getting more difficult to go through. 

Friends keep encouraging me to report to the police. I'm so scared that if I report him, he'll come after me. And if he doesn't come after me, I'll face social consequences. 

I ran into him last night when I was with my friends and my date, and he sent me a nasty text message about ignoring him. I want him to leave me alone, for good. I feel like I have to do this so he doesn't do this to anyone else, but I am just so scared of what will happen to me.

I was the same age as all these girls when these events transpired. Also, I dated many other girls before/between/after these girls, but I'm specifically picking the ones that I felt were serious relationships and lasted the longest. Also, I'll try to describe the three relationships in brief detail.

When this first happened, I shrugged it off. I didn't think much about it, and I learned from other aspects of the failed relationship I was involved with. (Honestly, I'd call it a successful relationship, because I learned from it and moved on with optimism.)

The second time it happened, it kind of hit me sideways, because until that moment, I didn't think the girl I was with was anything less than what I wanted.

The third time, it hit me as an undeniable pattern. There's something wrong with either who I'm finding or what I'm expecting.

What all the girls have in common is a lack of communication. I'm a very blunt, forward person. I approach them all with issues I find and anything that makes me upset.

How I communicate and what I communicate has changed over time. With Girl #1, I got upset and told her whenever I was. Every time. Nothing was ever too trivial to mention because I thought communication meant 200% openness. Girl #2 kept things from me and when I sought answers, she'd feel guilty and horrible and never really resolve the issue. Girl #3 is timid and shy and reserved and has a hard time opening up as it is.

Over time, I've learned to get upset less, show that I'm upset less, and ease into the situation much better and much more fairly. Girl #3 has taught me a lot about patience.

When it comes to clinginess and possessiveness and jealous, I tend to only be the healthy parts of all those things. If I had to pick one of those three things I was worse with, it would be clinginess. I understand jealousy comes with trust. I have no jealousy issues with Girl #3 for example but had tons with Girl #1. As for possessiveness, I lost that a long time ago. If I'm clingy, it's only because I'm showing I want them, and I think I learned to play it cool and relax with things a while ago--to not overwhelm them off the bat.

I can't figure out what it is. I find girls that can't communicate and they've all said the same thing. I don't know what to look for inside myself that will help me find the answer.

I deal with my own anxiety and depression, and then his just gets piled on top of that. I suppose I should start seeing a therapist again, even though I'm dubious of therapy's efficacy after my last few go arounds with therapists.

However, I have no clue how I’ll be in bed and I’m incredibly anxious about not performing (particularly premature ejaculation). 

This has made me avoid opportunities to have sex with girls that I’m close to for fear of being awful in bed. Even if they were really sweet about it when they realised I was a total novice, I know I would probably weird-out and worry what they were thinking/if they were telling our mutual friends etc.

 I thought the best way to get around this would be to find a random girl and have a one night stand. But after a while now that hasn’t happened.

There’s this girl who’s liked me for about a year now (although she’s dated other guys) and I’ve slowly fallen in love with her. But I’ve never done anything about it because my anxiety about performing remains. Like last Friday, when a group of us went out together, I probably could have taken her home, but I just sneaked off and went home alone.

I can tell she’s getting really frustrated with me and will likely give up/find someone else soon. 

**Questions:** Should I try to quickly hand in my V-card to a random (even craigslist or some shit) and hope to cure my anxiety (at least I’ll have some idea of what to expect)? Or should I go for it with her this weekend (or asap) and risk it being a total sexual disaster and losing her because of my insecurities?

Any help would be hugely appreciated – I feel like if I don’t slay this demon now I’ll be stuck here forever. Especially if you also didn’t lose your virginity until late, was your first time with someone you cared about? Or just a one night stand/fling? How did sex with someone who is much more experienced than you go?

BTW I can’t just tell her that I’m a virgin and hope that it won’t matter because I’ve previously made out that I’ve had girlfriends in the past etc.

I can't make a person stop being them. I can't also make myself like this person. By allowing them to ruin my day, I'm now pretty much aware how much control I pretty much gave them over my emotions and thoughts and just thinking and knowing that sickens me. I don't want to dislike them, because that just means that I still care. This is a person that I have a long (about 4 years), but bad history with, and they are going to be part of my life (it's a family member) for god knows how long. Just the thought of them showing up at a family Christmas dinner or a family get together should not ruin it for me, it shouldn't make me not want to go. But I don't know how to do that. I've been avoiding dealing with this for so long because I thought that maybe I'll just 'make' the resentment go away or I'll 'make' it stop.

Without a doubt, this person will always be there for family get togethers, holidays, etc. I tried getting along after the initial problem, but most attempts (a nice gift during appropriate times, trying to talk) were met with this.. fake, plastic attitude and I only found out about it when I was apparently being talked about behind me back. Hearing that didn't help the resentment already there, of course. I felt like I'm the weaker person for trying to be nice. My husband says to just ignore it, but how? He's the perfect example of not giving a fuck because as much as he dislikes them, it never bothers him or appears to. I want to be THAT. I want to stop letting the sound of their name piss me off. Being this angry about a person is really tiring and it's ridiculous how much time I've dedicated to straight out avoiding this person. I need help and I don't know where to start. 

I would like.. to just, I don't know... be neutral. If we're in a get together, I would like to continue on and not let their very being piss me off. I don't know how to address this problem within myself much less correct it. I know the past is the past and, while there are some things said and done that are unforgivable, being angry does not make me better.

Few friends; very introverted; dislike going out; perpetually awkward and nervous; never been in a relationship or close to anyone (even family); the whole shebang.

I just got home from this year's PAX (I've been going for a few years now) and I developed a crush on one of the cosplayers there. I *never* take pictures of anything, but I felt compelled to grab a picture of this individual (the costume was well-made, said person was attractive, and I had fun playing the game that was chosen). It was also the only cosplay picture I've ever taken. For better or for worse, the picture didn't come out well - I guess that that's what I get for not bringing a real camera.

Anyway, it basically led to me doing a quick search to try to find more information. I was kind of shocked as to how quickly I was able to pin down some information: I have this individual's email, city of residence, date of birth, and education level. I stopped looking for more.

At this point I was seriously contacting this person out of the blue to try to initiate contact. I'd never felt like doing anything like this before. I haven't made any moves yet *because I realise how incredibly creepy I'm being*. I don't even know what I'd say.

I was brought up in a family filled with strife, drug abuse, and parents who usually left me to my own devices because they were too busy with work, dealing with stupid, emotionally abusive relatives. I have problems with making friends and talking with the average person as a result I tend to be extremely clingy and dependent on the very few people I feel comfortable with, which is usually one person.

Because I only have one high quality friend, I am terrified that he will get tired of me and leave me and I'll be all alone again. I have to please and be perfect for him because if I'm not then he will get a new best friend and I'll be alone and when I'm alone I tend to do a lot of self-destructive things. I'm scared that if he gets better emotionally, physically, etc then he'll leave me and who will I go to? I secretly feel this way, at differing degrees, with most people I interact with. I need to be extremely nice/kind/loving/motherly because they probably wouldn't like me otherwise. If I'm really nice to people, they'll love me back? If I do everything right, listen to them always, be a nice, passive person then I'll never be alone right?

But it's not like that. People walk over me. They don't even pay attention to how much I bend over backwards and suppress my needs for them. I can't help but to feel angry, depressed, and cynical. They don't act the way I want them to. They don't say the things that fill my heart with joy. I feel like my body is being crushed whenever people don't act or say things that make me feel loved and worthy. I just want someone to love me unconditionally. I want someone to hold my hand in life and tell me that it's going to be okay. Why can't I find someone like that? Why can't I find someone that loves me? 

My family's love for me never seems to be enough. I don't take their love seriously. Their love feels fake even though I know that my mom truly loves me. 

Most of my issues are probably rooted in my low self-esteem. I feel ambivalent about myself. I don't value myself at all. Whenever my parents tell me that I should take care of myself more, bathe more,        be more presentable, I feel disgusted. Like why should I take care of myself? I feel more of a ""rush"" when I take care of others. When I have to comb my hair or apply makeup, I feel bad. I would rather hurt or hinder myself in order to make someone else happy, it could be someone that I just met, if I hurt myself just to hear them say ""thank you so much"" then it's well worth the pain. If I had the courage, I would have killed myself a long time ago, someone around the world truly deserves food/water/air/etc more than me.


I have a serious emotional hole inside my soul and I don't know how to fix it. Being wanted, feeling like I'm loved, etc fills it partially but then I want more, more, more. It's never enough. The only time it feels like it's enough is when I take hydrocodone or oxycodone. 

I don't abuse them a lot but I'm starting to greatly preferred ""high me"" over the ""regular me"". When I take drugs, I feel like I'm emotionally and physically satisfied; I don't need love, attention, kindness, etc. I'm starting to get mild opiate withdrawals and I'm scared of getting addicted (I've already seen the full extent that addiction brings on families) but the feeling of apathy and satisfaction is extremely alluring. 

I feel so pathetic. It's like that duck on Tom and Jerry, that goes around asking animals if they're his mother. I simply want love and validation, why is it so hard for someone to give me that?

What am I missing out on?,Deebo33,8,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/xwqn8/never_been_in_a_relationship_what_am_i_missing/,"Hello r/ihaveissues. I have a question that has bugged me for a while. Hopefully you ladies and gentlemen can help.

I am a 21yr old M, and I have been rejected by every woman that I have had a romantic interest in. 

More recently, I became really fond of a girl in a way that I havent in a while. After really spending time with her I was sure that we were mutually interested in one another. When I asked her out, she said no. A few months later she told me that she had a huge crush on a close friend of mine whom I would talk to about her for the last few months. Needless to say this wouldn't be too much of an issue, the problem is that I work with these people. I felt like I had been played in so many ways that I wanted to throat punch everyone.

This isn't the first time that I had experienced something like this. EVERY time that I have had a romantic interest in someone, they always confide in me as a friend, to let me know that they like one of my close friends. That is because I always come off as the friend. You know the nice type listens to you carefully, looks out for you a lot, buys you everything you want, wants you to be happy even if that means I am miserable, all that nonsense. I know that this is a problem when interacting with girls I like because these are things that they are not instinctively attracted to, they actually are probably more turned off by it then anything. I have however also decided that I am not going to change something so ingrained and positive (for me anyway) just to appeal to women. So I have to suck it up I guess. 

That experience however left me with the most bitter feelings toward pursuing a relationship then the previous girls that shut me down, especially because I like her so much. I am currently done pursuing girls, not sure how long it will last, but its been a few months and my mentality hasn't changed. 

I am still very curious though as to what I am missing out on. People complain about their relationships all the time, but it seems like everyone is in one, and they pursue them all of the time. What are the perks of being in one, what are the cons? What is the experience like? Does it help or hinder in your personal life? I would really like to know. Thank you guys in advance for reading.

X-post from r/ relationships,LykingIt,12,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/wqwai/my_best_friend_of_10_years_died_suddenly_about_a/,"I was told by /r relationships that I should post this here. Hopefully you can help. 

My friend Victoria (28) and I (26) met when we were 18 and 16, respectively, on a people to people student ambassador trip to Australia. From day 1 we hit it off and have been inseparable ever since. Even when I moved away to college in Boston and then to NY to do my adult thing. We spoke literally every day for ten years and on the 8th she passed suddenly of meningitis. 
I was lucky enough to see her 3 weeks prior during our yearly ""friend-cation"" as we call it. She was perfectly fine and in good spirits. All smiles and good humor as usual. 
Three days before she died she started having flu like symptoms and just got NyQuil and tried to tough it out. Next thing I know I get a phone call on my way to work that she's fucking dead. 
Naturally, I drop everything, fly back to my hometown to make sure I can attend the funeral, all the while only half believing it was reality. 
Everyday that the funeral got closer it became more and more real. I found myself slowly falling apart. When i saw her in that casket i lost my shit. That wasn't her in there. Since then I've been experiencing deep depression, fear that I can't explain, terrible insomnia, bouts of crying fits that leave me hyperventilating, complete lack of appetite (I haven't had a single morsel of food in 3 days now), and loneliness even though I have had an overwhelming amount of support and love pouring in from friends, coworkers, and family. Nothing seems to be helping. Everyone says just remember the good times but even the best memories break me down because I start thinking how we'll never get to make new ones. We'll never be each others brides maids, we'll never get to raise our future children together. I feel like I lost a part of myself. Like I have a hole in me that can't be filled. I feel crippled. Like I should just walk in front of a bus right now to make this feeling stop. 
I'm already trying to bury myself in my work, stay surrounded by people as to try to not be alone, I have a therapist, but of course she's on vacation until August 2nd. I just feel like despite the fact that I have all these people surrounding me and offering their support, they couldn't possibly understand. I get angry when I see people who are happy. I call her phone just to hear her voice on her voice mail. I tweet her because I feel like some how that's the only way I can talk to her. And I feel like all of that makes me crazy. Does it? Is this normal? I feel guilty that my last words to her couldn't have been more profound. Guilty that I didn't tell her enough how much I loved her and how much knowing her molded me into the person I am. A person I can be proud of. I'm afraid she never knew that. 
I guess what I'm asking is, is there anyone else out there who has been through this? How long does it take to feel like you're a whole person again? Am I normal or have I really lost my marbles?

I had already lost contact with my few female high school friends, so I agreed. No one could steal my sweetheart away right? Its not like I was going to talk to anyone really anyway, I was going to a community college. Things got worse from that point on. Now all of a sudden I can't go to the pool alone. One time I say ""Hi!"" to one of HER friends at school. Absolute rage ensued. She put me down, said she hated me, called me an asshole. Ignored me for hours, or sometimes days. This becomes a normal part of her behavior when shes mad. I try to communicate. I stay calm when a slurry of hateful words are thrown at me, and only say that I love her. 
 I recently found out shes been close to a guy behind my back. I question her fidelity. A week later, she apologizes. Tells me ""Things are different throwaway. I realized your the one and I want to marry you"".  She has been saying that for at least a year. That I'm the ""one"". I used to believe her too. ""Things are different now"", is another catch phrase of hers.

Usually what happens is I'll see a girl I find interesting or think I like a lot, I'll talk to her, get her number, everything will go smoothly, and somewhere between asking her out and the first date I just don't feel strongly about them, or I'll feel like I like them as a person but I don't have any strong feeling about them. 

I'm still not sure if it's a lack of an emotional connection i feel with most girls, or a physical thing, or a spark...or maybe because most girls don't even try when dating. Usually I'll go on a date, be awesome, and by this time I would win the girl over, she feels like we click, she'd indicate wanting to sleep with me and be emotionally connected but I feel whatever about it. Most guys would jump at this chance, getting offered sex..but I turn it down. usually this all happens AFTER the first date.

At this point I start to reflect to myself and I start realize I don't feel particularly strongly about the girl at all, neither physically or emotionally but I WANT to. I also never sleep with them because I don't feel like we click. But the whole lack of feelings towards all the girls I date makes me really lonely. I start feeling bad about it because I was so warm towards her and now I'm not....and it feels bad for her and me. And the fact that due to this I've never really been with any girl. I never feel like I like them enough, I'm starting to think that I should just push myself to like them and maybe i'll start liking them.

I just have never met any girl that I've felt strongly about it, and I'm starting to think there's something wrong here.....or are most people here like this? Sometimes it feels hopeless, I'll get a number and ask myself what's the point? I don't feel anything for this random girl. Might as well not waste my time. 

I REALLY want to click with a girl, I want that spark, I want to feel attachment of affection or something towards the girl...but I find it all goes away and disappears. I don't know why or what happens.

note: I'd like to point out that I do feel affection, attachment, etc ..it's just this...I'm not some robot or anything. I don't have any unrealistic expectations, or some ideal picture of what a girl should be or act like, and I'm not a hopeless romantic.

Here is the reason why I have issues. I realized I do not care about finishing school, at the point when I am almost really finished with it. And I feel guilty, spoiled, lost and confused. And angry.

I post and lurk around, but this is a throwaway, as you can see...

I am 25y old female. Ever since I was a kid I was guided by my family to prepare to enter a University, study hard, get my degree, make a career for myself, marry a good man, and lead a happy consumerist life.

My family comes from a country where economic stability has been a huge issue for decades. My parents moved out of there into a new, more stable country, when I was starting to hit puberty.

My father never finished his studies when he was young. His own mother (my grand mother) pushed him into University, and he quickly gave up, started a family (much to her displeasure), and moved on with his life. However I grew up influenced by his ""dream"": the big corporate management life, nice house with a yard, car, etc.

Of course, he also always wished me all of luck in my personal life, and is a very caring father.

My mom finished her degree, and went to a University that she chose on her own, continuing an artistic tradition running in her family.  
When they got married she devoted herself to the family, and her own art suffered due to the lack of time, and money. She worked in multiple jobs since then, helping our father feed us. Sometimes she had time for her art, usually not.

When I was applying for a high school, I knew I love to read, and to write. I had good grades, and I liked literature... However I did not feel specially talented for anything except sitting and reading science fiction and fantasy. I applied for two high schools.  One was more generally oriented - and I failed to enter there. The second one was sort of a business school, and I spent my next 4 years there, preparing to actually apply to University, which was always some sort of huge GOAL that my life was running towards to.

When I was applying for a University, however, I still had no idea what interests me, or what I was good at. I was scared to enter any University where there would be lots of thesis and writing - the language I study in is not my native language, and I have not managed to achieve the level of writing style in it that I would love to. 

I knew that there are Gender studies, and this idea seemed really interesting... however I did not think at that moment even WHY it seemed interesting. I brushed it off, as a thing that simply would not bring me money or social status that seemed to be... my destiny? I was scared I will end up with low-level income. I went to a mall and looked around, and realized that I love all that stuff in the stores and just want money... 

So I applied to business University, where I have spent my last 6 years studying all the ways how international companies work.

Those years were good, and I got a low-level degree after 3 years, and now I should finally get my final degree.

My path seemed sort of straight, leading to some far away misty future.

On a side note, all my life I was trying to be this really nice daughter and not argue with my parents or do anything really against their will. I had my fun, but I never confronted them directly, or had any sense for ""rebellion"". If there was an argument with them, I would break down and cry, and try to think of a solution with them, because I always valued their opinion, and I think of them very highly.  I have a younger sister, and she was always the ""artistic rebel"". I was supposed to be the ""normal"" one. 

Oh how I want to laugh now at this.

When I turned 25 years old, something broke in me. And then everything changed.

I started taking anti depressants, and this helped me pull myself together and start thinking about life, and what do I really want from it.

Two months before I was supposed to finish University, I broke up with a very young perspective and nice man, to enter a complicated new relationship that I love every single minute of, even when I want to pull out my hair and yell (for being happy, or for being scared). I never loved like this.

How and why this happened is a different story - but I entered a whole new world of information while I was finding my new identity (sexual, in this case - but this can be connected to any kind of personal discovery since the introduction of internet). And I realized how much the topic of gender issues and sexuality is a taboo in the country where I live in. And these emotions stirred in me something that was always there - need to share, need to educate, need to help people love themselves, need to protect. And need to learn, of course. Otherwise I would never even get to this point in my academic life.

I got intoxicated with the freshness of it all, and when my parents noticed that their good girl is not stressed enough about the final exam, they tried to make me study more...

The trouble was, I have a job... I had where to move out... there was actually nothing holding me to stay with them. I discussed with them my need for my personal freedom, but emotions were running high, and they were confused and scared, and I was feeling oppressed and angry that they do not trust me.

I packed bags and moved out. They were so stressed about my studies they even had no time to worry about me being a lesbian. It was a shock for them - that I absolutely defied them. 

I felt like I was hitting puberty at 25. Better late then never?

I wanted to pass that final exam, and I studied, but not enough. Absolutely NOT enough. My motivation was gone. I was starting to feel so detached from my University and from the whole idea of degree. It became just a way to prove a point, that I am still a valuable ""normal"" person that I was when I lived with parents. That I am still ""great"".

Of course, the little part in me that realized that this is not what ""great"" is about sabotaged the whole thing. 

After the first try, I had 3 moths to get ready for the second try.

It is soon. Very soon. In a few days.

And... I am not ready for it, once more. This time I will definitely ""fail better"" - but I should have prepared twice the more, and gave it twice the more time than now. To be fully prepared for it I would need more determination and wish than I can possibly summon up at this point in my life. 

My parents will be so disappointed. And the last chance would be after summer, and then - no degree for me. I wish the last chance was now. That way everyone could stop asking me how is it going and when will I finish it and am I studying and am I nervous and OOhhhh what will I do.

I just do not care... I do not care about it anymore. Is it possible that one can change so much in half a year? Is it possible that now, at 25, I am slowly starting to realize that I can really do whatever I want to - and have my own dreams, and try them out?

I have issues. I do not know if I feel more sad that I will disappoint my parents, or maybe I feel more like a spoiled brat for not living up to the ""dream"", while my parents tried to support my education for so long. But I have a feeling all these years I am the guilty one - I let them indulge in their dream about me, and I felt comfortable in this pleasant zone.

And why cannot I just make my silly brain remember all that stuff from books so I can at least say to my parents ""OK I have the degree, thank you for support, now I will try to see what I really want to do"".
Instead of that I sit here writing this huge post.

Thank you if you read this huge wall of text, and... I think I just need a hug. I have been valued for so long only for my academic accomplishments. I am so tired of that. So... tired.

I guess I would like to know if anyone was in a similar situation and how you have dealt with it.

TL;DR After years of studying I realized I do not care about finishing my University. I feel guilty and sad that I will disappoint my parents.

Am I being pathetic?,notliketheothers,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/tmmlx/struggling_with_school_and_boyfriend_is_making_me/,"I am a 19 year old girl. I have been with my boyfriend for 6 months. Our relationship has been going well. A few bumps here and there, but nothing terrible.

To give you some sort of background, if it helps. I have been diagnosed with PDD-NOS, an autistic disorder. I have also been kinda depressed for most of my life (although I don't think I should call it a real depression) I was abused by my father as a child, heavily bullied and beaten by kids at school until I was 13, and I've had two previous relationships, both of which ended because the guys cheated on me a lot. Because of these things, I have very little self confidence, and all in all I am a weak person. I'm bad at handling stress and difficult situations, especially when it comes to school (school has always been one of my biggest struggles). Eventually, things turn out fine, but not without a lot of tears, miserable moods and the occasional urge to self harm.


While the past few years have been going pretty well for me, I'm currently struggling very much at school. My classmates have all turned against me and were pretty much 'bullying' me for two months - until they started completely ignoring me. I don't really have anyone else at school, so this makes me feel very bad. I have been trying to figure out why they suddenly started disliking me so much, but I'm at a loss. This has been making me feel very unwanted and stressed out, and I am having trouble keeping up with school work. I am supposed to graduate before this summer, but I'm not sure if I can make it, especially if I keep feeling like this. I'm doing my very best and my teachers have been very understanding and supportive, so that's good. But it's still affecting me a lot. I don't eat or sleep well and sometimes I will be in a decent mood, but then suddenly it will just go down the drain. I also have moments where I just get upset and cry, and sometimes I will talk to my boyfriend or one of my closest friends. 


But now I have another problem, because my boyfriend says he doesn't like my negative thoughts. He thinks I am too sad too often and I guess he thinks I depend on him too much. I try very hard to distract myself and keep myself busy, without needing anyone else's help, but sometimes I will get in a bad mood. My boyfriend notices that, so he will ask me what's wrong, and I'll explain. I don't make a big dramatic scene, I just tell him I'm feeling a bit down because of the things that have been going on. Sometimes he will cheer me up, sometimes I'll cheer myself up, I'll usually feel better either way. Rarely, I will get very upset, and I will come to him because I need to be comforted, or held, or just... need help being calmed down. When that happens he always seems understanding and patient, and he always makes me feel better. But then, a while afterwards, he'll be very distant and grumpy, and tells me that it's because my negative thoughts are dragging him down. This makes me feel very guilty...


I basically just want to hear your thoughts. I am not sure what I'm asking for, but I need to figure out how to cope. Do I need to suck it up and go on, and shut up about it when I feel sad?

I was 8 years old. My mother was very quirky, and my dad worked all the time. I was raised by my disorganized mother, a TV, and family pets (I still trust animals more than people). When my parents split up, they shared custody.

My mother is manic depressive and bipolar, and is prescribed dextro amphetamine for some reason. Following their separation, my mother became delusional. First, she told me and my siblings (I'm the youngest) that my father had let one of our cats outside so it would die, because he hated cats (she still believes he tortures animals for fun in some sort of dungeon in his new house...yeah).

Then, this delusion escalated, she started believing that my father had been molested by his grandfather, and that's why my father was ""mean"" to her. In this case, she thought he was mean because he got upset that he'd work all day and come home to a disgusting house and he'd have to clean up.

This is about when my dad moved out.

Then, she went all out, she started believing that my father had raped (not even going to use the term molested anymore because it lacks the severity that my mother intended) me and my siblings since we were babies, that we had been repressing all of those memories, and that my father doesn't remember doing it because he has multiple personalities.

I was the youngest, and my parents still had split custody, so I spent half of my time with my mother, who at this point I trusted more than my dad, being convinced that her horrible delusions were somehow true. I spent half my life being psychologically tortured by the only person I truly trusted.

When I would be trying to go to bed at my mom's house, she would sit down on my bed and basically rant at me about how I had been raped by my father, in grotesque detail, until I would break down crying and just tell her she was right so she would stop. She convinced me I was in danger every time I would go live with my father.

At my dad's house he would read me Harry Potter before bed.

I lived two separate lives.

I've been coerced to lie to police officers on several occasions, and she even went as far as to have me examined for signs of sexual abuse at a child welfare place (there were none, but she was delusional, she gave no fucks).

This went on for months, and my mother began figuring out ways to violate custody. Under threat of arrest for kidnapping, she dropped me off at the divorce therapists office (I hated this therapist). I walked in alone, and my family, therapist, and lawyer were all standing there. I was terrified.

I took out a phone my mother gave me to call her on, and the therapist and lawyer tried to convince me to give them the phone (they were enforcing a court order that I have no unsupervised contact with my mother.

I ignored them, and as I placed the call, my lawyer pinned me down to try to take away the phone. My sister yelled ""don't touch my brother"" and threw him off of me.

At this point I had already broken down. I became dissociated from reality and started crying, and I didn't stop for days. All of my memories from this period of my life are fractured and incomplete. I basically realized in a split second that my mother had been lying to me all this time, if my father had actually been molesting me, she wouldn't have dropped me off there under threat of arrest, she was just a manipulative cunt, and the shock was too intense for me.

After that, we only had supervised visits with my mother, which I hated. She would try to occasionally tell us things about my father, but we ignored her, it still hurt to be constantly reminded of the fact that the mother I love is gone.

I don't talk to my mother anymore. I have huge trust issues and I can't deal with any level of dishonesty. I can't handle being yelled at or someone even raising their voice to me, it triggers a fight-or-flight response in me.

I don't really have a question, I just feel like if I want to have a loving relationship with someone again, I need to take all that effort to make sure they know that I'm still dealing with trauma, and that I have a lot of boundaries that can't be crossed.

I go to therapy and I'm making good headway, and I have the support of my family and friends, it just really, really sucks sometimes to know how bad things can get, even with one of the people you are supposed to be able to rely on and trust no matter what.

So yeah, that's me, I guess I have a few issues. Thanks for reading.

I'm not sure how much of this is related to my wife and her ongoing problems.

I've been together with my wife for around 10 years, but we only married a couple of years ago. She is kind and good looking, but unfortunately suffers from rather unfortunate destructive behaviour.

My understanding is that she is essentially punishing herself. She hates being helpless, but she does not like to try things, because she has to do it perfect the first time, or she will see it as a huge failure (and not try it again). Because she cannot do things, she wants people to help her so she can achieve what she wants, but at the same time she resents them for making her feel worthless and that she can't do things on her own.

She forgets positive things but latches onto any possible negative things and nuture them. When misunderstanding or mishearing something to be negative, she cannot let go of the anger she feels, even after realizing she misunderstood.

I've been trying for so very long to help her work through this, buth initially I did not know how her problems really worked.

Since she can't do much, I have to work, and she resents me for it. Both the time it takes away from me helping her, and the fact that she isn't making her own money. (People have suggested various jobs that could suit her, but she has shown no interest)

We have children, and I have to jump in and take care of them when she feels too tired. She considers my work, which I now do from home, more or less something that steals time I could spend taking care of the kids and relieving her of some work.

I am also taking care of our economy, shopping and repairs on the house. My stress is affecting my stomach and my eye vision, giving me ticks aside from psychological issues.

My wife can't take criticism - any detailed ""this particular thing is bad"" she hears as just saying ""you are bad"". This just makes her angry/depressed, which simply means I need to spend time calming her down.

For very long now I've felt no particular ""drive"" to keep on living. I simply do it out of obligation and responsibility. I don't do anything for myself except try to control my stress levels somewhat, to be able to get through another day. I feel no passion for anything, there is nothing left.

My family moved around the world when I was 14-16.  Since then, we've never been in the same place for more than a year or two.  I've never had girlfriend, mainly because I've never been in one place for long enough to start a relationship.  Also, because I've never had a solid job to support a relationship.

A little about my personality:  I'm a VERY rational person.  I don't show much emotion (I do get angry sometimes, but rarely exhibit sadness or the like), and am quite unsympathetic.  I've tried to adjust who I am a few times, but I feel very out of place when I do.  I tend to listen a lot, and don't mind carrying on conversations that have value (no conversations about useless stuff).

I'm a junior at university now and still don't have a girlfriend.  I have a few friends who are single, and I've asked a couple of them out, but I've been rejected by each.  Of course, even though they reject me, I'm still used as their ""listening"" puppet.  I put up with this mainly because they are my friends, but at the same time, I feel like I'm being drained.  

Anyways, I realize I'm not the best looking person in the world.  I'm a brain, so my physical ability is very limited.  Recently, I've put on a fair amount of weight, even though I eat healthy and have a physically strenuous job.  Plus, I have a small back problem that has caused me to develop a slouching posture (I wish we had the money to fix it when I was younger, alas...).  

But I don't understand why I get rejected? I think I'm a nice guy, I listen, I have money, I have time to spend with her, but even with that, I still don't have a girlfriend.  I've been teased in my department that I'm gay (definitely not; 100% straight) because everyone there has a girlfriend.  Maybe I haven't met the right person, or am not ""desirable"" enough?

EDIT: Something I just thought of. I'll be graduating in a year or so and be off to grad school.  Would it be worth it to pursue any type of relationship given such a short time frame?  I've heard that long distance relationships don't work.

This is probably gonna be a long post as I have a few things on my chest so grab some popcorn and enjoy the schadenfreude. 

I have a few problems with my life to fully explain why I need to go back a few years. Four years ago I was on top of the world there really wasn't anything I couldn't do (or it felt like it anyhow). I lived my childhood dream of being a magician, not maybe the coolest of all childhood dreams but I loved every minute of it. I was working all the time and had lot of ""friends"" around me and the lack of sleep didn't bother me at all.
All this changed in the spring of 2008 as I was bitten by a tick which didn't even notice at the time. My body crashed on the bus a few days later and after a few very painful weeks of test the doctors discovered that I had attracted Tick-borne encephalitis [TBE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_encephalitis) which easily put is a brain disease.
This disease left me in a hospital bed for six months and bedridden for another one and half years. Not only that (it is now all of the depressing stuff starts) I had also lost the sense of hunger or the opposite the sense of replete after a meal. Not only that so had my nervous system also taken a good beating. I lost feeling in my hands aswell as daft aching in my body.  

I wish this was the end of my problems but no. During the time I was sick I got two phone calls from two friends and that's it. I was home alone sick and nobody cared enough to check how it was with me. So when was feeling a better after two years I contacted a few friends that I known for the longest time and tried to pick up the pieces of my former life. I was presented with a choice either I stay for the rest of my life living on early retirement or try to do something with my life. 

The choice was clear as water to me, I won't be able to sit at home for the rest of my life so after a bit of consideration I decided to become a teacher in math and social studies. So I packed up my stuff and moved to university. The first semester went okay although I noticed that my body couldn't handle to studie and be social, so my social life was pretty much dead except the normal ""Oh hi how are you?"" conversations you have during the breaks. My days consisted of me going to the class coming home, sleep for three hours, read whatever I needed to read, make food and going to bed around 21.00 (09.00pm) otherwise I couldn't function at all in school. 

The semester ended and I got back to my hometown to meet some of my old friends.
Here did things go very wrong. If you haven't noticed it already I have issues with staying completely serious all the time and I make bad puns all the time, hell I made a living out of it once. Which apparently bugged one of ""friends"" so much so he infront of everyone told me to shut up, quit jokeing around and face reality. And then he proceeded to tell me why nobody in that room cared if I was there or not. I'm so embarrassing to be around and the only reason it was okey before was that I was a magician.
Everyone else in the room just sat there silent and didn't say a word so took the hint, grabbed my jacket and said goodbye and walked out away. This was people I grown up with and if they didn't want even be with me, that shook me up pretty badly I never been cut so deep by anything. I was questioning my whole existence, why am I here, what the hell am I doing, do I even belong here anymore.

So I took the train back to the university and my student apartment and spent the rest of the summer in a empty town by myself. So I deiced to change to restart my life yet again so started to force myself into meeting new people. Nothing haven't really came out of this yet (still doing it I'm stubborn as fricking donkey) but I think I found the problem. I gotten huge trust issues with other people, I try to not be so cynical but its hard when you body automatically goes all paint it black^tm mode (man that was a bad joke).
With that said I haven't stopped trying since as I see it if I stop trying I might aswell try to be superman and try to fly of a cliff.

(Friendly note: Go and get more popcorn or a drink)

Right now four years after everything went to hell for me I'm still in school but my body can't really keep up with the pace anymore. It aches more then ever before and I have started to get a bit of twitches in my hands and according to my doctor it is stress related and I need to slow down in my life which I barley have, and that feels like a slap in the face from lady fate (Never piss off lady fate free advice from me to you). 

(Soon done I promise just 5 more hours...why are you looking at me like that?)

But lately I stated to want more I want meet someone and to be with someone. I never been in relationship in my life before I got sick and my body broke down I always said there is time for that later (oh the irony). And now I'm broken down husk of a man I used to be and I can't for justify bringing my own problems to someone that could and will find someone better then me. 
Even though I can see it being better this way with my head it is hard to kill off the feeling of it though. Which puts me in this very weird situation that I really don't enjoy a bit and to make it worse there is this girl that sometimes but not always pops into my head which just makes it even harder to accept the facts. Sometimes I wish my body could handle alcohol (I'm pretty sure a 5 year old girl is a better drinker then me).

(You still awake? Why am I asking if you are awake if you don't you won't read this...)

Anyhow that's my life so far and I have no idea what to do in the future. I'm trying to keep positive about it and soon not even my own personal bullshit won't be enough which is probably why I feel the need to write this here. Everyone has a breaking point and I'm getting close to mine.
So in the end I'm wondering if the struggle I'm going through is worth it and am I doing the right thing even? Questions I don't have the answer for right now. I don't feel I'm going anywhere and the problems and issues just keep coming and coming and I still remember when I lived my own dream like a bitter sweet treat.

About 4-5 months ago my ex broke up with me. It was clean, no hard feelings, but I essentially told her I didn't want to see her again, because it would be too hard seeing her without being with her- we haven't spoken since. I've been working on myself, and I think I've been doing generally well dealing with it and moving on. A lot of things have happened since then.

Before we broke up, I had an apartment with her in 2010, and shared a house with her, my best friend and our cat in 2009. Every time I think of 2009, see my cat (which is staying with a friend until I get back from military training for awhile), talk to my best friend (who moved to Guam and is in the Navy) or anything associated with it though, I get nostalgic, although that word doesn't seem to fit these circumstances.

I keep feeling like these ""good times"" of my life are gone, and I won't be able to get them back.. Or rather, when it might happen is so far down the road in life, I'm unhappy it's not happening right now. I was very happy then: I had everything I needed under my own roof. We were all kinda like a family. All of that has come and passed, and I don't feel as happy as I used to be. I'm working on myself and trying to improve what I can, and being single and separated from some of these things has made me come to some powerful realizations, but I still don't feel what I had during 2009 and a little of 2010. Even little things can set off this sort of ""nostalgia,"" from going to Wal-Mart (we all used to go there a lot), hearing certain songs, or even watching certain movies or playing certain games. It's beginning to wear on me and I wish I could just erase parts of my memories and wipe it clean.

This all sounds ridiculous, I know, but what is happening? How can I fix it? Does anyone else do this?

I still think that he broke up with me because I was not good enough for him (not skinny enough, not pretty enough) especially because he met a new lady friend at work who he texted with a lot.

I posted a thread a while back asking women what their sex partner number is. Recently I've become very insecure about my number. Yes, I like sex. But at the same time, I feel that my number is too high in the amount of time since I lost my virginity. I was raised in a sexually conservative family. My total is now 6, in the past one and a half years. First was with my ex, who pressured me into it. Second was with a rebound. I wasn't sure then that I wanted to have sex, but he was very convincing. Third was with another ex- who after became a FWB. Fourth was with an ex, who I cared about a lot. Fifth was with a FWB-type relationship. That one too I wasn't sure that I wanted to sleep with him. The last one was just oral, he was more persistent that we wait. He is now a FWB. So, I guess the ones I cared about I was fine with, but for those I didn't, I just felt cheap and bad about the situation. I'm seeing now how better it is when you really care about the person. On the one hand, I can't wrap my head around people that have slept with over 20 people, but on the other, I think it's great that they have the sexual freedom to do so. I guess I'm trying to reconcile with myself about the number. Again, I like sex, but I don't like feeling like a slut. Any suggestions?

I don't know how to describe it exactly. But I try:

I'm 21/M. While I'm working thousands of thoughts go through my head. It can be that I'm happy in the morning and suddenly 2 hours later I'm sad, angry or even pissed off. Well I think it has to do with the following facts:

* I never had a serious girlfriend and am still a virgin

* I got rejected so many times I can't count it anymore

* (Former) Best Friend *probably* fucked the girl I was dating while I was on vacation. Probably because I don't have a proof, but I'm not buttstupid and they're both obviously lying. This gave me the hardest emotional scar. I could never imagine people can be that shitty until then. It took me a lot to not lose my temper and beat the shit out of him. But I'm glad I didn't use violence

* I've fallen in love with a girl I met a month later after this incident. But 'til today it's complicated and I don't know where we stand exactly. Somedays I could tell she's into me the other not and I still hadn't the chance to meet her alone without mutual friends and talk about my feelings

* Made out with another girl at a party recently. Mean yeah sounds awesome right? But it just didn't feel right. And when I found out she only turned 17 it made sense I couldn't connect with her emotionally. I always thought I would be so glad if a girl is totally into me, but I had to realize if you're not that into her it's just annoying.

* Somedays I feel awesome, somedays I feel like a worthless piece of shit

* This incident with the former best friend still comes up sometimes in my mind even when I don't want to. Can something fucked up like this ever go away *completely* out of my mind?

What do you think reddit? I somehow think the rejection thing is killing me. Yeah I tried several times to move on, but on somedays the loneliness and feeling of being worthless just kicks in.

Any tips/suggestions how I can control my emotions better? :(

As a bit of background, I was abused as a child and had a pretty shitty life. Turned to drugs at one point but I'm clean now, except for the anti-depressants. My last (and first) relationship was unhealthy, he used me and ended up cheating on me, so I have trust issues with guys now along with trust issues with everyone else.

Several months ago, I started dating a very nice guy who is a shy kissless virgin and not at all the type to use someone. This makes me feel a lot safer with him, since he won't pressure me into doing anything, but sometimes I still find it hard to do anything sexual with him for fear of him just using me to get off or gain exp.

But the main problem I have is the damn emotional deadness I get. I really like and have feelings for him, but am so used to shutting off my emotions that I find myself sitting next to him and just...feeling dead inside, and hating him for being close to me, and wanting to be anywhere else, alone. And of course it's impossible to show any type of affection towards him at this point, so I act cold and distant. It's terrible and completely not his fault, I just get that way due to my past. But if this goes on I will only get more angry and frustrated, mostly at myself, and will have to leave him. 

Not sure what to do. Probably should talk to him about it, but...how would someone go about doing that? Also, does anyone else have experience with this, and if so, how did you deal?

**BACKSTORY:**

So when I got to college, one of the first people I met was this girl (we'll call her M). She was a year older than me, but as we both played the same club sport, we saw a lot of each other and became really good friends; we also have a whole bunch of friends in common. 

Fast forward to the summer between freshman and sophomore year: She visits me in my hometown (several times) cause her family has a summer house there. It was during this summer that I realized that I didn't just think this girl was cute, but that I really had feelings for her. Well, when school starts again, she begins a yearlong study abroad program.  Don't get me wrong, sophomore year for me was fun, but it did feel like something (someone, really) was missing. And it wasn't for lack of contact; we skyped and talked on facebook quite a bit. But it just felt like something was missing. 

Fast forward to last September. I see her for the first time in about a year, and my stomach gets all butterfly-ish, and for a little while, I'm the happiest person in the world because I get to see M again.  So we spend a whole bunch of time together over the course of the semester, and my feelings start to get really strong for this girl. So one night, we're both at a party, and she talks to this other guy all night, and goddamn maybe it's selfish and jealous of me, but it hurt to watch. It made me feel physically sick. i texted my sister (I'm really close with both my sisters), ""M has been flirting with this guy all night and it is literally crushing me."" 

The next day I call M and ask her if we can talk. I go over to her place and we have a really long conversation that essentially boils down to me confessing my feelings for her and her telling me she's not going to date me. I left and went back to my place, and as soon as I closed the door, I was sobbing. A grown-ass 20 year old man bawling his eyes out in his bathroom. So I decide that I need some time away from M, and to give myself some space and try and get over her.  I do this for several weeks and she got the memo. So a couple weeks later I call her up and we begin to hang out again. Well, it turns out that I wasn't over my feelings for her. 

We're now pretty close to today chronologically. I talk to my sister and realize that I need more space/time away from M. So last night, we're both at the same party and I just kind of avoid her all night. She notices and when I decide to leave she stops me at the door and demands to know what's going on. So we step outside and and she asks me what's going on and I explain why I've been avoiding her all night. She keeps apologizing even though nothing's really her fault. Anyhow, I tell her that I need to just not see her for a while, and this visibly upsets her, but she understands and gives me one last hug. 

**ISSUE:**

So I woke up about an hour and a half ago, and realized that I just told my best friend of 3 years and the girl I'm in love with that I couldn't see/talk/communicate with her for a long time.

I am a new Redditor, but I am already loving the community. So I figured I throw this out there and see if anyone has any advice for a girl like me. First off, I am am a 25 year old Female, and I have never been in a serious relationship. I am panromatic, and until recently, thought I might be asexual. I am beginning to think that might have just been a defensive state of mind, but let me elaborate.

I am still a virgin, but am currently seeing a great guy who seems to like me back. He is the first guy I have 'dated'. Things are going great with him, except for one thing. 

My self esteem issues. I have have been overweight all my life. Like, morbidly obese. My highest weight was 315lbs, and I had gastric bypass when I was 20 to help me lose it. I am down to 180lbs now, and fairly happy and stable with my weight. What I am not happy with is my self esteem. After I lost the weight, I underwent several surgeries, including a double brachioplasty, an anchor incision tummy tuck, and a breast lift to take off the extra skin the fat left. It is a vast improvement over being a whale, but I still can't help but feel like Frankenstein's monster. 

I of course have stretchmarks everywhere from being overweight, and now I have very very large scars everywhere. Under my arms, on both breasts, from my cleavage down to about two inches above my ladybits, and from hip to hip. 

On top of this, I have eczema, and eczema scars on my legs, from where I itch like crazy every winter, and am missing half of the big toe on my left foot from a law-mowing accident when I was 12. 

I don't feel sexy, or attractive, and never have. I've dealt with years of people calling me ugly cow and other terrible hurtful things. When I was younger, I told my father I wanted to be an actress, and he told me straight to my face, ""Honey, you need to think about other jobs, you're not pretty enough to be an actress.""  My self esteem is in the ditch.  The few times anyone has ever called me beautiful or pretty, or cute, I get incredibly defensive and assume that it's sarcastic.  

The guy I am seeing knows about all this, and insists that he thinks my scars are cool, but I get physically nauseous at the thought of ever undressing in front of him, even if I have the desire to. I want to be able to be open with him, and I appreciate the things he says to me, but there is always a part of me that says, ""he's just being nice,"" or ""You're going to get your heart broken once he sees what you've done to yourself."" 

So Reddit, I ask you, how in the world do I start to try and get over these feelings when they are so deeply ingrained? I don't want to be that girl that is always hiding in the corner in the hoodie.

I am a 23 year old woman, my brother is 8 years older than me.

Basically the story with my parents and I, is when my brother and I were younger my dad was verbally and physically abusive, he would beat us, throw television sets at us, tear down ceiling lights and say we clean it up in front of him. It was over small stuff, such as not having a pitcher of tea in the fridge, or watching The Simpsons at night. Well my mom allowed the abuse to happen, and my father ended up cheating on my mom with another woman so they got a divorce.

Well my mom got custody of my brother and I and we moved into a small 2 bedroom apartment, my mother started hoarding to the fact where we didn't have a kitchen table because it was covered 3 feet high in news papers and you couldn't see the floor. Well my mother started looking for love and started dating one of my brothers friends. Yes a 45 year old woman dating a 18 year old, I was 10 at this time. He of course was just dating her so he didn't have to live at home. Well my brother moved out and moved in with his girl friend at the time (now his current wonderful wife) so it was just myself and my mother and her boyfriend and his friends. Well they ended up breaking up, so she met some man online named Kevin, talked to him about 2 months, and he lived in a different state so she paid his bus trip up here, and let him stay in the apartment! He ended up being crazy and schizophrenic and thought there were cameras in every vent and I was talking to her ex boyfriend.

I ended up getting taken away by social services when I called the police on him when they were fighting and they saw the hoarding and the extreme unclean conditions and took me to my dads house.

Moved in with my dad and his wife, (the woman he cheated on my mother with), I truly believe I was just there so he wouldn't have to pay child support. The dogs in the house were put on a higher pedestal than I was. If I said how my day was I was screamed at so until I moved out at 18 I said 5 words a day. Not exaggerating, just 5. I even tried telling my dad when he spoke to me and treated me as such I wanted to kill myself. He was unphased and said well there is a gun out in the shed so you might as well just take care of it.

I moved in with my grandmother once I turned 18 and until I could find a job. Got a job, met a wonderful man, moved in to our own apartment. I am in school for nursing and about to start my clinicals, I have paid for everything and have pushed myself every step of the way. I love my life how it is, but I feel guilty because I have completely cut my father out of my life. The only time I see my mother is if I go over to my grandparents house (she moved in with her because she couldn't pay her bills. Is it wrong that I feel my life is so much better without them?

All my life I've been a very shy and awkward person. One of the consequences of this is that I have always had problems relating to women. I wasn't well liked in grade school (I went to a private Catholic school, if that helps contextualize the setting) and all the girls thought I was weird, as did most of my schoolmates in general, actually. Growing up, my sister acted mean and judgmental toward me at home, and my ""best friend"" acted the same way when I wasn't. This slowly took a toll on me over the years, and I grew to feel as though I was being scrutinized by everyone around me. I became a very emotionally guarded person and I feel like I've spent a lot of my life retreating inside my mind, cutting myself off from what I've always viewed as a hostile humanity. I never had a functional social life that involved actually opening up to people until I was well into my high school years, which is when I started making what I consider to be true friends for the first time.

I got my first kiss at 16 with my first girlfriend, which lasted two months. I met my next girlfriend at 17, who was, looking back, a very prudish and emotionally distant person. She didn't talk much and intercourse was completely out of the question. We lasted 10 months and had very little sexual contact in that time. I lost my virginity in college at the age of 20 after eight months of dating my then-girlfriend (she would later go on to perform in an S&amp;M-style bondage show behind my back, an event that started the unraveling of my trust in her which eventually led to our breakup.) The pattern you should be noticing here is that my relationships have been relatively few and far between, and sex has always been distant and intimidating for me, even in the context of all of my serious relationships. I had a number of opportunities for casual sex late in high school and early college, but I was always too uncomfortable with the idea to ever go through with it. Maybe if I was strong enough  back then to step out of my comfort zone, I wouldn't be having problems now.

Fast forward to present day: I've been out of college for six months and have been dating my current girlfriend (age 20) for about a month and a half. She is the first person I've had sex with since my ex and I broke up, with about a year in-between relationships, and the second person total that I've slept with.

Her history is far different than mine, and her attitude toward sex and interpersonal relationships is much more healthy, shameless, and open. She has been sexually active since she was 14 and by her count I'm her 48th partner. Additionally, unlike my strictly monogamous history with the opposite sex, she has a history of maintaining a polygamous lifestyle. This in itself does not bother me, since all of those encounters happened before we ever got together. What bothers me is that the way in which her experience and outlook informs her behavior brings out my insecurities. I still put up my emotional guard often and maintain a strong personal bubble, but she is very flirty and physically friendly with those that she knows, including male friends, of which she has many. Like any other college-age adult, she also likes to go out and get drunk with said friends. Sometimes I go with her, sometimes I do not (due to my nightshift work schedule.) Again, this in itself does not bother me, but she is accustomed to environments and social settings where flirting, teasing, stripping, and casual sex are part of the norm. To me, this lifestyle is foreign and uncomfortable, and when she is out I find myself worrying that she is doing something that would hurt me if I ever found out. Not overwhelmingly or enough to induce a panic attack or anything like that, it's just a nagging in the back of my mind that I wish would shut the fuck up but I have such a hard time suppressing it.

We have discussed this and she understands my position and my boundaries. I'm also being exceedingly careful to remember that my attitude is just as foreign to her as hers is to mine, so we're both trying to be patient with each other while we learn how to, as she puts it, ""play by one another's rules."" On a logical level I know that I have no real reason to worry or believe that she is being unfaithful, or to think that she doesn't care about me enough to take my sensitivities to heart when she is spending time with her other circles. The reality is that she is a passionate and genuine human being, but I'm just so vastly unaccustomed to her idea of what is normal that I have a hard time separating my emotions from my knowledge that I'm blowing things out of proportion. I know that I'm being overly worrisome and paranoid but I can't seem to shake it completely. I'm afraid that I'm putting her off by acting too possessive, effectively punishing her even though she has been nothing if not patient and understanding toward me.

She has helped me to get better but I'm afraid that it won't be enough. I've been trying to take a proactive role in acquiring a more healthy and realistic attitude but I'm afraid that my efforts will be too little too late. I really dig this woman and I don't want to fuck it up. I don't want to be like this anymore.

I usually fall hard and fast, and I usually am the first to bail out on a relationship. I'm separated from my husband of 3 years, we will be getting divorced early spring. We have a three year old son. He was addicted to World of Warcraft and we had intimacy issues.


My boyfriend's last relationship was 4 years, he thought he was going to spend the rest of his life with her. She cheated on him, then formed a relationship with HIS FATHER. He was devastated. They shared custody of a dog. He recently gained full custody and no longer has to talk to her. Which is a huge relief. He would bring her up a lot, and it was really hurting me. We talked about it and resolved the issue. I think a lot of my pain was from before we were dating when he told me he could never love anyone like that again.


My problem is I love him. And I'm horrified that ""karma"" is going to catch up to me. I've always been the first to give up on a relationship and this time I'm determined to stick it out. I'm miserable and scared that he can never love me like I love him. We've been taking things slow, I haven't told him I love him and he refuses to talk about the future since he planned on spending his life with his ex and she royally screwed him.


TL;DR My boyfriend doesn't know I love him, we both have emotional problems. I'm terrified ""karma"" from my previous relationships means he will hurt me. AND I'M SCARED!

We met Freshman year of high school and quickly became a solid couple that felt more like an incomparable friendship with hormonal expression than two kids dating. We ended up going to the same college and have been steady the entire time.

As far as intimacy goes, we had a run of passionate more-often-than-not sex for about 2 years towards the beginning of college, but that eventually degraded to a situation where she was going in and out of yeast infections and UTI's. At it's lowest, she endured cringe-worthy pain every time I was in her. 

It took me a while to catch on. I think she was under the impression that if she didn't have sex with me all the time, I'd leave her right away. When I finally did notice that something was up, I explained to her that I wasn't going to up and leave her, that I valued her as a companion more than as a sex partner, and I encouraged her to see medical professionals about it.

Roughly 3 years and several treatments later, no definitive cure has been found. She would try a treatment, and we'd test it in bed. Sometimes we would have a good night and nobody gets hurt (yay!), but it usually ends with her cringing and me pulling out right away. 

Now she's become so conditioned to think that sex hurts that she avoids any form of intimacy. I've told her that I'd be happy and content if we reverted to our pre-sex days that consisted of snogging, heavy petting, and fellatio, but apparently my fingers are like sandpaper and she gets jealous when I get all the fun and she gets none. At this point, I have to beg for most of my kisses.

I still love her very much, but I feel like this relationship is missing something serious. My mind wanders toward thoughts of cheating and breaking up, and I hate myself for it. What can I do?

1314082500.0,7,self.ihaveissues,jrgms,"Lonely 29 year old male virgin, addicted to porn and masturbation - averaging 4 times a day spread out over 3-4 hours of watching porn. Daily.",crustacean81,8,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/jrgms/lonely_29_year_old_male_virgin_addicted_to_porn/,"Very long post, so please bear with me.

***Before I describe my problem in detail, first my background:***

I am a 29 year old male virgin. I have never been with a woman, never been touched by a woman in a sexual way, never been kissed on the cheek or lips or anywhere else for that matter, never been loved or never been wanted by anyone (except for parents, maybe). They never hugged me as a kid and never said, ""I love you"" to me when growing up. I felt as if I grew up in a loveless family. Add to that, constant physical and verbal abuse that I endured as a kid from my dad. The relationship with dad while growing up was more fear based rather than love based. Though my dad is not an evil person inherently, he used to believe in the adage of 'spare the rod, spoil the child'. As an adult, I don't have much respect for him for that very reason. I am good with my mom though, and respect her tremendously for putting up with my dad. My dad also happens to have several backward notions (like women should not work, etc.) while at the same time he is a highly educated person. Talk about ironies. Worst part is, he still verbally abuses my mother and I am not able to do anything about it, though he does not do it in front of me.

I was also addicted to internet sex chat rooms, but now more or less I am not into those. Though occasionally, I do visit them, but for some reason, now a days, I get bored with cybersex very soon. So internet sex chat rooms are not a major issue right now. I tried to substitute internet sex chat for real intimacy, because real intimacy, I could never get or experience. And that is my problem which is that I lack intimacy in life, I have no confidante to share things, I am a socially awkward nerdy sort of guy, who does not know how it feels to have someone special in life who loves you for what you are, despite everything else. Other than that, I have several self-esteem issues as well. I have very few close friends. By close I mean friends with whom I can share anything and everything about my life. On the outside, I appear cheerful and friendly. But on the inside my loneliness is driving me crazy. I am also slightly overweight, but I don't have motivation to lose any weight as I think I have lost all zest for life. I was also bullied as a child in school and the emotional scars are present until today. Even now I can't handle confrontational 'bad people' and would rather capitulate than try to fight for my beliefs. In short, I am a total mess.

Right now, the only two things I am proud of myself are:

1. I am reasonably smarter than most people (am studying for a masters degree in computer science in a reputed US university right now). 

2. I can empathize with others, and will usually go out my way to help them. I am not sure if I do this to get their approval or to feel good about myself. I am not sure I do it because I know how it feels to have no one care about you or love you. I am not sure I do it because I don't want the others too to feel the same way. All I know is that it makes me happy to see others happy.

**Now my problem:**

I am a porn addict. I am a virgin, maybe that is what is causing this fascination/addiction. I watch porn for as much as 3-4 hours every day and masturbate for 4 times on average. Sometimes as much as 7 times. I *honestly* don't remember when was the last time when I did not masturbate. Several times, I have tried to curb this addiction, but without any success. It has increased to the point that it has started to interfere with my studies and work now. I used to joke that earlier masturbation acted as a stress buster in times of duress, but now I have realized that though it releases pressure in the short term, the long term psychological effects of it are going to scar me for life. How do I end this addiction? Should I go and have paid sex with a prostitute? I know I can't have any girlfriend who will love me in this life. So what do I do? I am not suicidal. At least yet. But not sure what the future holds for me.

Please don't give any religious advice as I am an atheist. Also thanks a lot if you have read until this far.

**TL;DR - Lonely 29 year old male virgin, addicted to porn and masturbation - averaging 4 times a day spread out over 3-4 hours of watching porn. Want to end this addiction as it is hampering day to day activities. Had a pretty loveless and lousy childhood.**

I've tried to get help from my friends, and they can't help me, either because they're puzzled and aren't sure how to approach, or are busy with their own romantic lives. There's been a time where I was with a group of friends, yet all of them were couples, and at one point I felt absolutely awkward because I felt so out of place and that I couldn't relate to them on a level. Dating sites have been absolutely worthless, the free ones generate traffic but no interest from anyone, and I don't have the money to use the paid ones.

Everyone tells me that ""there's someone for everyone"", but it feels like an empty statement since no one has given me a chance. As every day goes by, it feels like another chance has walked away.

I have no idea how to break the vicious cycle, and actually get the chance to make an impression. I know it's possible for me, yet I'm out of ideas. The only thing I can think of is someone ""coaching"" me, although that shows how clueless I am about this.

EDIT: I should've also pointed this out earlier, but I have Asperger's Syndrome, which may also play a contributing factor to my issues.

EDIT2: Another problem that I'll put out here is that I can't drink, due to a medical condition (seizures). Normally this would be a QQ moment when it comes to the topic, but in my case, it's proven to be quite a hassle. I went in a bar one time, went to meet some classmates and got early, and sat down and ordered some water. I got some of the weirdest looks, and even after explaining my situation, it felt like I was shunned by everyone. I tried it two more times, and each time, the same thing happened. Which also meant that my pickup chances imploded on me in all three cases.

I'm a six teen year old male, and I believe I have social anxiety disorder.

Growing up, I did not have a sibling, and I am usually very shy. I rarely speak in a public environment.

Some situations (that have happened):
Sitting on the bus stop, waiting for the bus. If a girl sits down (three seats, and say I'm sitting on the first seat) on the third seat , I can't (wont?) look at her, - just act like she doesn't exist. I also seem to ""behave"" awkwardly. 

I have tried marijuana before (and went out in public) - I honestly believe it does help me with calming me down.

I'm aware smoking is bad, I know it is illegal, etc. However I have that attitude of ""don't care what you think"".  

Another situation, 
My mother introduced me to a girl (we were close friends when we were young apparently. I don't remember). We had dinner with her and her mother. I don't know why but it was really awkward. Then we went to her house and watched some TV. She started speaking to me but I (intentionally) killed the conversation with sarcastic remarks. 

I have little to no friends (handful) - Facebook is pretty useless for me (200+ of 'friends' I barley speak too).

I like computers, electronics, etc.
But I avoid those subjects in real life conversations. 
When someone mentions anything about computers, I try my best to act like a dumb ass - who has little to no knowledge of computers.

When I was in the fourth/fifth grade, I had a ""relationship"". Obviously not serious (and I understand that) - but I don't know. I looked for attention (kind of) after the relationship ""ended"". I said I was going to commit suicide.

Now that I speak about it it's still pretty embarrassing. 
I think that 'mistake' I've made pretty much lowered my self esteem to the lowest possible.

Because 7 years 'later', everyone who heard that, including the girl goes to the same school I go to. I live in a pretty small community..

I just feel like every single girl that went to the the same school as me in the fifth grade told the other girls, and word just spread on. And now I feel like it's impossible to approach other people.

I do/did pretty bad in school - but I started to improve. Since I have no social life, I guess I can at least work on school right?

I follow/believe no religion.
When I have an issue with something, I try to find what's wrong (without depending on others)

I am considering joining a military branch.

edit:
I guess I should also add (if it matters) my parents were divorced when I was really young. 
I'm pretty sure I was in kindergarten.

Things got really physical and I can still remember what exactly happened. 
Because of this, for 2 years or so I lived in another country (lived with fathers parents, aka my grandparents).",,False,,t5_2s90u,True,,,True,t3_iyd2a,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/iyd2a/social_anxiety/,

In school, I was the ultimate teacher's pet because nothing made me happier than being told how smart and wonderful and special I was by the adults around me. Looking back, I now realize that so many activities I picked up I did so solely to impress people.

That has now caught up to me and kicked me in the ass, and I now wonder if I'm broken and incapable of making my own happiness.

I lost my job a little over a month ago. I only had the job for 10 months, during which I worked under an abusive manager whom I could never please no matter how hard I tried. Even when I gave 110%, she would always find a way to nitpick and criticize me. I would cry myself to sleep almost every night because I was so miserable to not be told I was valuable. And then, when I got fired, it seemed that everything that made people think I was special came crumbling down. When I had to move back in with my parents, off I went on a rollercoaster of emotions that I can't stop.

I just feel worthless because I no longer have any accomplishments worth praising, and I'm convinced everyone thinks I'm a loser and therefore not worth anything. I have no idea how to mentally reassure myself or, in less eloquent terms, stop giving a fuck about what others think of me.

My parents and my boyfriend keep telling me to stop caring and just focus on me and what makes me happy to make the job-hunting period easier, but that's my problem: to be happy, I need other people's approval, and without a job or school, I don't have a place from which to draw that. I mean, I'm stooping so low that I'm looking for it in the dumbest places, like a League of Legends match with my boyfriend and his friends where I complained to him that I wasn't having fun because his friends weren't commenting on how well I was playing. He had to explain to me the seemingly obvious fact that a game should be played for fun, not to prove myself to others to siphon off their praise. But I can't separate the two, because part of the reason I play the game is because I want him to be proud of me and his friends to think I'm cool, and if they're not voicing that, it must not be true.  

I'm terrified that this will wreck my relationships with my boyfriend and my family, all of whose patience is wearing thin with my constant demands for comfort and reassurance of my worth. Except that when they tell me to stop caring what others think, it just makes me care even more.

Help--how do I learn to make my own happiness instead of constantly relying on the praise of others to feel worthy?

And I'm scared out of my mind.

A bit of background... I've never been rewarded for planning anything. Everyone always tells me I need to plan better for my future, for my meals over the next week, for exams and projects that are coming up... but whenever I plan, whether it's just a plan A or if plans B and C are made as well, nothing goes the way I expect. So I've gotten used to thinking on my toes. It makes me terrible at chess, but it makes me fantastic at putting out fires as they come up.

The problem is that whenever things are looking up in my life, I start making vague plans for the future. Inevitably, these plans do not work out. Breakups get in the way, huge drama comes up, family obligations take precedence, betrayals happen, I might have to move or I might get fired from a job... one way or another, my plans become moot. I've gotten so used to it at this point that I barely notice anymore. But I have now unwittingly convinced myself that I must be doing something wrong personally - that I don't DESERVE for my plans to ever come to fruition, either because I'm not preparing myself enough, I'm not working hard enough towards my goals (everyone I know insists that I am, however), or I've done something terribly wrong and karma is biting me in the ass.

Well now what's biting me in the ass is my fear of losing everything. I have a ridiculously fantastic boyfriend now (28 yo) - we've been official for three months, but have known each other much longer. We first met in elementary school, and were inseparable as kids. When my family moved across the country, just before he was gonna do the adorable childhood thing of passing me a ""do you like me?"" note at school, I lost him for more than fifteen years. We found each other online a year and a half ago, and we were immediately just as attached at the hip as we were when our ages were in the single digits. He makes me happier than any man ever has, our interests have remained similar even with a decade and a half of separation, he's handsome, he's intelligent, has similar beliefs and politics to me, he's honest, and he thinks I'm the most amazing creature ever put on Earth. It's the kind of boyfriend every girl dreams of having, and I am beyond lucky to have found him again.

Naturally, the vague plans for the future that we're creating and throwing around together - 'cause let's face it, I'm an idiot if I don't marry this guy - are scaring me. I'm so afraid I'm going to lose him one way or another. He'll die in a car accident, or he'll cheat on me, or he'll go to prison, or he'll have to move to another country without me for some reason, or he'll betray me somehow... I keep imagining these scenarios interfering with us eventually getting married, having a nice house, having kids together, and having the most epic game room ever created for a basement. We would have the most perfect life together, I know it, and he knows it. But I'm completely convinced that one way or another it's not going to happen.

EDIT: This has started to manifest itself in thoughts of sabotaging the relationship by cheating. I've cheated on past boyfriends before, so part of my brain is like ""eh, this isn't unusual for you, just sleep with some other guy, who cares?"" but obviously I don't want to do this. Rationally I know it's not in my best interest to, so I've resisted, but I worry I'll let some guy sweep me off my feet with the promise of only temporary happiness and no future at all.

How do I get over this? How do I let myself be optimistic? How do I get past my fears and allow myself to plan for a future that I want?

tl;dr - Nothing I ever plan for works out in the end, and now I'm planning for a future with my amazing boyfriend, and I'm scared I'm going to lose him just because that's always what happens to me.

* if I get in a relationship, then it's not just her I let in, but her friends, her family, her acquaintances etc. If I'm not even sure if I can handle one person, it pre-emptively scares me to have to please this many people. I might spend the rest of lifetime trying to figure out her likes and dislikes, and now there's exponentially more to keep track of. How do the others do it?
* if I'm already quite close to these women, that we cut through any small talk and just discuss *deeper* things, and I'm not *that* into sex, then how would a relationship be fundamentally different from what I'm doing now? I'm still close to all of them, we go out, lots of moral support. What else is there? (*honest question*)
* it scares me that people can commit to one person that you've met among the hundreds you know at any one time, from the possible millions walking the earth. How are you sure that's the right person, or you're the right person for her?

I always feel burdened by the fact that I COULD be doing this or that, could be excelling in something else that I'm good at, instead of whatever I'm currently working on. This mindset causes me to panic and switch gears constantly and is extremely counterproductive. 

I'm 19, I know I have a loong time to decide what I want to do with my life, but it seems like while everyone else has chosen some direction as to what they want to focus on, I'm all over the place. 

One thing I'm really into and naturally gifted at is art, but because I feel like I can't make a practical career out of traditional art, I guess my goal as of right now is to go the digital route. Because I'm trying to transfer to a techincal college to do this, I'm having to take several computer science/programming classes, upper level math classes, and even lab sciences; in other words, a lot of subjects that I can't stand and really have no interest in. At this point I'm so miserable in my current curriculum, and so unsure that I'll get into my school of choice, and SO ready to move on to doing something that I actually enjoy, that I just want to drop everything I've been working on and switch to something else entirely, to finally start doing something that I love. 

Sometimes I feel very panicked and anxious and almost depressed over making the ""right"" choice. I think, what if I'd been focusing on another one of my passions instead this whole time? Music, film, writing, whatever it might be. Sometimes I'm absolutely sure I'd be much happier with a different focus. But I know I'd also end up asking myself the same thing: what if I were doing something else instead? 

Anyway, my point is that I cannot decide what I want, and I'll always feel burdened by choice, no matter what I do. This shows in my hobbies too, random sporadic switching between different things. For a couple of weeks I'm a painter, then suddenly I'm a singer or flute player or pianist in my spare time, then a jewelry-maker, then a poet, then whatever else comes next. Never focusing on anything long enough to actually make any progress or build on my skills. 

This probably all just seems like the typical indecisiveness of someone who's just beginning a college career and isn't sure what they want, but I seriously get worked up over it sometimes and it's always in the back of my mind. I feel like I'll never be what I want to be because I'll never know what exactly it is that I want to be, and then I'll settle for something mediocre because I'll never focus on one thing long enough to be great. 

tl;dr: constantly worrying that I should be spending my time differently and focusing on a different skill/hobby/career, and because of this I never make progress on anything and I'm always unsure about what to do with my future.

Anyway last October we hired him to fix a pipe in our bathroom. Fast forward to this year when we needed him again for a leaky pipe last month. My mom, my aunt and I were all home when he came to fix the pipe.

- When I answered the door for him, he reached out his hand to shake mine, but I didn't notice so he dropped his hand. Feeling stupid and rude, I quickly stuck my hand out to shake. He put both his hands over mine to shake it.

- He commented on my hair and how it looked different than last time, and how much he liked it. He mentioned it twice.

My mom told me to go talk to him while he worked - to keep him company. So I went and he ended up talking my ear off, and asking me questions as well. It turns out he's pretty nice, really into business, spirituality (something I've gotten into lately too) and he also has Crone's Disease which he was hospitalized for and had surgery. :( I run a small business with my sister, a shop that caters to subcultures like anime and videogames. We're moving to a bigger location in a week. I told him about it and and he offered to help us out in any way. After he left my mom told me to keep in touch with him. As opposed to just contacting him when we need him to do stuff for us. She started calling him my 'friend' a lot too.

Anyway, I listened and sent him friendly texts, asking how he was, and discussing business too. We text almost daily. Just things like 'how are you? Will you be available ________ day to help us with __________. Have a good day. etc.'

*Today* he helped us out again by carrying some products to our new store. (He has a truck and offered to help us transport our large store fixtures from our old store to our new one) At the end of it I offered him gas money but he declined and left quickly. My mom told me that my sister and I should go for a drink/dinner with him. So I called him, but he already had plans with his daughter tonight. He said next time though.

*We've known each other for 8 months now, but only started talking (texting) this month.

p.s. I'm 23, female, and socially anxious. I don't have much experience with interacting with guys my own age (never dated) never mind older men. (He's in his late 20's, plus he has a 6 year old daughter which is a turn off. :s) Anyway, would you say he's interested in me or just a friendly/kind person?

p.p.s I think I started developing feelings for him, like I think about him when I shouldn't. &gt;.&lt; Unfortunately, I'm so self-conscious and anxiety-ridden that I find myself subconsciously convincing myself that longer like him (and that he wouldn't really like me) because I'm afraid of something coming of this.

Part II: the situation

My friends are pretty wild, they are the party hardy kids who are all pretty wealthy. lets call them

Jake (kid who dad is a renown architect and who has been given a pretty sick apartment, a brand new tahoe with lift kit, and a job working for one of his dad's friends that pays SUBURBLY, pretty much being a phone jocky)

Craig (Dad runs the top dog precious metal distributor, has been given top spot in his dad company and has access to huge stretches of party land alonge a major party river, any vehical he wants, and a pretty sick boat)

Craig and Jake are i guess youd say the top dogs here. Ive been friends with them for many years but lately our relationships have been strained. I have been getting chewed for not partying as much cause im so over loaded, and i get shit for what i own and my folks situation, and i mostly let is slide but its been building up annoying me. Well, last week I brought a girl whome ive became pretty close too our to craigs party land along the river for her birthday. I spent several hundred setting it up and inviting people and got a pretty good showing over about 80-100 people out there. Bought 1 am i was so plastered and worn from waking up for work at 5am I went to the girl and told her i was going to pass out in the truck, and to wake me when she is ready to go to sleep in the tent. Well, i pass out as planned and 5am rolls around and i awake to find im still in my truck, and my girl is no where to be found. So i wander over to my tent in the now mostly empty camp ground (except for one other car and craig's tent) and check. my girl was not in there so i begin to wander back to my truck. But i stopped and went to check on craig. To my horror i found him with her half naked on top of him passed out.

My natrual reaction was to of course snap and beat the tar out of him but  by the time i had got into the tent the both had woke up and i held back and just asked them if either had an F'ing explanation. Got my girls stuff, threw it in the tent with her and him and promptly loaded up and left the love bird together and headed home.

I proceeded to text craig to tell him he deserved an ass whopping and should be ashamed of himself. I then in anger posted a post on facebook saying ""Nothing like waking up at 5am to find your girl tangle legged with another dude""

I was called about 7am by jake whome ive known longer than craig and have been best friends with for years till he went on this recent money &gt; old friends tangent and he defended craig saying it wasent his fault and i have no right to threaten him nor be angry at either of them. That i should essentially just deal with it. My promp respond was to tell him he is just as much of a low life and hang up.

later that day i see both of them at the gym and jake cracks a joke in my direction, i responded by telling both of them if they have a problem with my opinion they can step outside with me right then and there (i wont fight in front of children at the gym). Both declined and walked away.

PART III: Situation now

I have NOTHING compared to these kids, and due to this whole weekend I have been put up as the bad guy, and in turn even my most trusted friends, people whome ive spent much of my time and money to help, bring up, and given nothing but honesty have left me high and dry to continue the party with the others. Ive pulled the closest strings i have and even offered a mellow olive branch to the culprits but to no avail. Even my soon to be room mate has ditched me. I litreally have nobody O.o

On one hand it feels good cause i feel free from the judgement due to my birth fortune, but on the other im now 23 and nearly 15 years of friendships and social building has evaporated.

What should I do? And was I in the wrong for being angery? If it was either of them i know for a fact my whole damn investment would be threatened?

Aside from being perfectly happy single (more money, I can do what I want etc, not beholden to somebody else, don't have to worry about picking up the slack in a relationship, I can focus on myself/studies/hobbies etc.) and being averagely successful casually with girls (I wouldn't call myself a 'player' but i'm certainly not a washout with girls) - I get my emotional support from my friends, as over the years I lost that typical macho guytittude of holding all of your emotional pain inside and never sharing it, I have a support network of very close friends, a close bond with my family (me and my brother are extremely close now), I consider myself well rounded - I don't need someone to ""complete me"".

I just don't get why I need to look for all of this in a girlfriend. What's the point? I'm wayy too young to get married. Of my friends who are in relationships, I'd say about half of them complain about their bf/gf a LOT, and i'd feel they'd be much happier kicking them to the curb. When me and a friend called a group of guys to meet up and go to town one of my friend's said he cleared it with his gf to have a ""guys night out"". That was really surreal to me like he had to hand in a notice of ""fun"".

But what is it that makes people want to be in a relationship so much? What do people get out of it? I suppose marriage being the end goal, but seeing as marriages aren't working out, relationships break down and what not, I do sometimes think that the whole arranged marriage thing might make more sense. I suppose that sense of having regular sex and someone who you can share intimite thoughts with about your dreams/goals whatnot, but I don't see that as any particular draw. I share my hopes and dreams with my friends - both boys and girls, and I have sex with girls who are (hopefully) not my friends. Mixing those two worlds seems a bit messy.

Don't get me wrong, I believe love exists, just not the hollywood romcom bs that we've all bought into (i think that shit is as damaging as hardcore porn).

I guess I could leave the question at that. Whenever I'm in a relationship, I want to be out of it; when I have a girl I wanted, I want others. To an extent, I can relate to Woody Allen's character in *Annie Hall*: 
&gt;The... the other important joke, for me, is one that's usually &gt;attributed to Groucho Marx; but, I think it appears originally in Freud's &gt;""Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious,"" and it goes like this - I'm &gt;paraphrasing - um, ""I would never want to belong to any club that &gt;would have someone like me for a member."" That's the key joke of &gt;my adult life, in terms of my relationships with women.

Is this inevitable, after the ""honeymoon period"" ends? Is it a symptom of youth - will I get over this when I'm older? Is it evolutionary - as a male, is it my biology pressuring me to ""spread my seed""? 

I've always been a serial monogamist; I've gone from one long-term relationship to another.

I am a 23 y/o male who has trouble making friends, meeting people, and creating relationships. I would have trouble with this anyways due to my shy/introverted nature, but find the issue to be exaggerated due to my physical appearance. 

Whenever I enter a room I can see every female in the room meet my eyes. When I try to approach new people and introduce myself (other males) I am often rejected or ignored. As you understand being a decent looking man is not the same as being a woman and people will generally not approach you or be friendly. When I find someone being friendly too me, this will generally change when women notice that I am being social; as they will begin to flock to me like butterflies. I can instantly see looks of disgust and hatred on my newly found potential friends face and find myself now being rejected. 

Often times the only people who will talk to me are women and when I am speaking with women, guys will come up to me yelling at me to leave or start shoving me, demanding that I stop being drunk and belligerent (which is ridiculous since I have to be one of the most loquacious people on the planet) etc. Often times I will get kicked out of bars just to appease the mass of d-bags that I find hating on me. 

I even find the few people I do know siding against me in similar situations, being passive aggressive etc. As you may well know physical attractiveness in a man doesn't amount to much. Most of what women find attractive is social aptitude and I often find myself isolate and rejected. Any advice you might have for me would be appreciated.

1368914033.0,8,self.ihaveissues,1eljd2,I (F 23) am finding it more and more difficult to be with my boyfriend (M 24) after his brother (M 20)passed away (X-post from r/relationships),i-am-a-throwaway,8,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1eljd2/i_f_23_am_finding_it_more_and_more_difficult_to/,"I’ll try and keep this as brief as possible. I have been with my boyfriend for 16 months. In November, his brother died but since it has happened I’ve been so proud of my boyfriend for coping with it. In the last month he got himself a very good job and moved out of his parents’ home. I got a job two weeks ago, but now we’re 3 and a half hours apart. Since he moved we’ve seen each other every weekend.



Since his brother died, our relationship has been terrible (to me). I have been there for him as much as possible, and I've done everything I can to help. Aside from the first week, he has barely talked about his brother. He told me he has bad dreams often, but prefers to just talk about my day or play games or something. On New Year’s Day he told me some really awful things he’s forgotten about. At the funeral I had told my boyfriend I felt closer to him, trying to be supportive. But he told me I made his brother’s funeral ""about me"", and trying to ""score points"" with his family. I couldn't believe he thought so little of me and I tried my best to explain it. He now accepts I didn't mean it in a selfish way, but still maintains I chose ""terrible wording"". He’s also told me he’s not going to talk about his brother with me, because I barely knew him. And he told his little sister that I thought his brother was an ""annoying ass"". My boyfriend and his brother argued all the time, and my boyfriend complained about his brother often, so I just tended to agree with him and say ""Oh yeah, he is annoying"". Stuff like that really, but my boyfriend was so convinced I actually hated his brother that he told his sister I didn't like him. I've expressed I did like his brother, but it's natural other siblings can be a pain in the ass (my boyfriend doesn't like my sister much). Was my boyfriend within his rights to say these things to me? I understand he was/is grieving, and I've weathered his comments, but they hurt a lot. He also struggled to save “I love you” for two months after it happened, but I don’t blame him for this.



We barely talk during the week. We get along fine in person during the weekends, but now I’m lucky to even get a few texts in the day. He is always busy; he does a lot of things with people from work or he’s doing his maths degree (I don’t know why he’s still carrying on with it full time considering he has a good job and an excellent degree already). I now don’t even bother asking if he’s free to talk later on, I know he’s too busy for me. The rare times I do ask is met with ""I’m doing something tonight"" and I feel crushed.  I feel like a part time girlfriend.



My boyfriend is a very very practical person, and (rather unfortunately) I suffer from depression. I've been okay generally before his brother died, but I've been growing increasingly more depressed over my relationship. I was also jobless for 7 months, and this was adding to things. I didn't want to burden my boyfriend with my feelings, so I kept things to myself. Over the last few months I've been trying to explain how it feels, but he doesn't understand at all. I moved out of my house for my new job two weeks ago, and I want to move back home and commute from home. When I tried talking to him, he was arguing why I should stay, and not listening to me. My feelings are always made to be invalid or stupid. He needs justification for everything I'm doing, and lectures me a lot. I told him how depressed I feel, and he said ""What’s making you depressed?"" It’s too hard for him to understand that ""Sometimes people go through depression without a specific reason"". I told him I’m sad all the time, and he said ""Well that’s just you being sad. That’s not depression."" This made me really upset, I’ve suffered from it since I was 17, I've been on meds and been to counselling and it recurs often. Eventually I gave him a ""sufficient"" enough reason to him to believe I am depressed (that I hate where I’m living). I feel so exhausted by life that I often want to die, but he doesn't know that.



I hate how I feel all the time. He is the last person I turn to when I need to talk to someone. I talk to my best friends and family first, and talk to him only when HE has time. I am constantly having conversations in my head about breaking up with him, and I wish I could stop feeling so anxious about it. When we’re together in real life, I feel I've just been too dramatic and sad over nothing during the week, but the next week of neglect starts, and I feel shit all over again. The reasons I am holding on is because I feel the loss of his brother has affected him greatly, and I feel things could get better. 



I don’t know what to do anymore. Communicating that ""I want to feel like I matter to you"" doesn't do anything. He tells me he cares about me, and seems irritated by my feelings. Talking about depression only causes another argument. It doesn't feel like we’re best friends anymore. I just feel like an empty shell.

When it happens, trying to engage normal logic and thought processes feels like trying to navigate a very dimly lit room.  If anyone has experience with anything that feels remotely similar, I would really appreciate anecdotes or advice.


Background(Me): When I was little my parents were convinced I was autistic because I was borderline mute and obsessed with books.  This has basically been a recurring theme in my life -- barrages of tests, therapy sessions, school transfers, etc. with no clear diagnosis of any learning disability or mental disorder.  I buried myself in computers because they promised logic and order right up to today as a CS major.  In hindsight, I probably did this out of a fear of becoming schizophrenic (which I interpreted as someone with a disorganized brain) because my mom was convinced I would be once since I look somewhat like my schizophrenic aunt.

Background (Family): I have an entire textbook worth of mental illnesses within 1-2 generations on both sides of the family.  Compulsive hoarding, paranoid schizophrenia, alcoholism, manic depression, and probably a bunch more.  I have lots of stories that seem kind of funny to the rest of the world, but are kind of tragic when you realize they actually happened.  My grandpa never trusted a single sign on the highway because he thought that they were there to intentionally mislead you into taking the long way to your destination and therefore use more gas as part of some government conspiracy.  My grandma would lock me out of the house every time I went to get the mail and I would have to find an open window to get back in.  My dad is so insanely gullible that if you tell him ""Go to the store and buy x brand"" but a salesperson tells him that y brand is better, well he might come home not only with someone you didn't ask for but will recite the sales pitch to you verbatim as if it was an original thought.

Today: I've moved out and this has only made dealing with my family a lot more frightening since I get to see their craziness from a whole different perspective.  This on top of the difficulty of my course load has really weakened my self-confidence in my own sanity and intellectual ability.  I've seen how it affects me firsthand - after a day with my family, simple coding problems become impossible.  After being told that the problems are easy, I'm suddenly able to fly through them.  It's gotten to the point that I can't confront my own weaknesses in the material because it sends me into the self-doubt spiral.  I avoid talking to classmates because I'm morbidly afraid of saying something stupid or incorrect.

I am a terrible people person, I don't try/want to be, I just have the inability to create something even friendly with anybody. This keeps me in a static state of inexperience on every subject. And the thing that is bothering me the most about getting close to this girl, or any girl, is the simple fact the she has had a normal social life. 

She has dated, she has ex-boyfriends, she has had sex, she has experimented with drinking/smoking, she spends all her time with friends and traveling, and experiencing new things like any normal person. I have always wanted this, I have always worked to have a social life like this. I have traveled, I do spend time with friends, I have done stuff that she hasn't, but I still know for a fact that I am woefully less experienced than her when it comes to the important things: being a normal well-adjusted person.

Besides the fact that I have never had a girlfriend or experienced any real intimacy/emotion with another human being, I know my lack of basic experiences means I WILL be bad at them when I do try them, and this terrifies me. So much to make me avoid getting close to those people that understand those experiences, and hoping to find someone like me or more inexperienced. Which I continually learn is a waste of time because as I get older (20 now) the less that is likely to happen. Hell, every 15 year year old I know has experienced those same things that I have yet to, or that I didn't experience until ""adulthood""/after 18.

Now the thing that might be bothering me the most with this specific girl, is the fact the we were both sheltered kids, but her inherent reaction growing up was to fight that and break out to experience the normal things both our parents kept from us. This shows something fundamentally wrong with me, I did not/do not actively live my life. Shit just happens and I just react to it. Don't get me wrong I am good, even great, at some things, and I'm luckily enough to be really good at what I love doing, but again that is all meaningless without people to share it with. 

People tell me I am really mature for my age and strangers always think I'm older than I am. This makes it even harder to find people that are my level of experience and really embarrassing when they learn how little I know about life/the world. And for whatever reason, I'm afraid to live and will only watch my life create a journey for me, while I sit back away from people I care about but can't possibly match up to.

My parents got divorced when I was 4 and my dad moved across the country to live with the woman he cheated on my mom with. He has no idea how to show love or affection so I grew up not only physically distant from him, but emotionally as well. Fast forward 10 years and I enter a 3-year relationship with a total douchebag when I'm 14. He cheated on me all the time and blatantly lied about it. We had a very mentally abusive and controlling relationship. It was horrible.

Now, I've been with my current boyfriend for 3-and-a-half years and although he is an extremely trustworthy person and has never hurt me (other than little things), I still get paranoid when he wants to go out to bars or pretty much do anything without me. I've been working on my issues a lot lately but he just said there's an EDM show on a day that I can't go, leaving him to go with some of his friends. Just the idea of him going to a rave without me makes me immediately spiral into paranoid thoughts of him cheating or just behaving with girls in a way that I wouldn't find acceptable.

I don't want to control him and I really want to be okay with him going out and doing things without me. I'm currently seeing a therapist, meditating and exercising regularly, and trying my absolute best to rid myself of my fears of abandonment. My SO expects a quick fix even though I told him it's going to take patience and time. He feels like I'm controlling him and that I won't let him live his life fully. He is starting to resent me for it.

I'd like to be okay enough to let him go to the show without me (it's in about 3 weeks). I'm in desperate need of some calming words, advice, or stories right now because I don't know what to do anymore and I don't want my worst fears to come true due to a self-fulfilling prophecy because I keep pushing him away.

1365700644.0,9,self.ihaveissues,1c59nf,I (m36) want to find my wife (f35) attractive,spartandudehsld,9,0,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1c59nf/i_m36_want_to_find_my_wife_f35_attractive/,"I have been mostly happily married for 10 years with 2 years engagement and 1 year dating prior. She is my first and only love, first kiss, first sex and I do not want to hear anyone's comments if you suggest separating.

Here is the situation: I started jacking off to images starting at age 12 and progressing to mild porn before I met my wife (at age 23). After marriage I didn't quit and escalated to online porn videos and occasionally going to strip clubs when out of town on work. I hurt her badly with this; both with actually doing this stuff and with lying to cover it up. Last summer she found my internet history and confronted me on it and I really decided to change based on how much it hurt her. I managed 2 weeks before I was back at it. In December of last year she found me out again and said unless I got help she would have to leave me. Thus began a massive journey for me of cold turkey quitting porn (on /r/pornfree/ and I've made it over 120 days), nofap/no masturbation, journaling, going to group therapy for sexual addictions, adding constructive hobbies as replacements for porn, playing music for her to sooth her to sleep and doing stress/tension neck releases on her every night. 

I was hoping that stopping this deluge of erotic images would allow me to appreciate my wife's physical appearance better. It didn't. I noticed that I now think I look damn good in the mirror (a first for me) and that her appearance does not bother me anymore (a slight improvement), but I continued to lie to her that I found her beautiful. I had prior made a promise to myself that I would never let that secret out. 

Last night she was reading a self help book on healing relationships after sexual addictions and the main point stressed by the authors was honesty. Well after discussing that honesty was critical to an intimate relationship and getting me to promise that I would answer her questions no matter if I hurt her feelings she asked me if I find her physically/visually attractive. I said no. There are many aspects of her body that I love; her sensitive nipples, her beautifully formed nose, her beautiful soft lips, her long flowing wavy dark hair, her delicately arched feet, her beautiful brown eyes, etc. but I have a problem with her weight. I know this is shallow, I know that I should find her whole body beautiful, I would love it if I did. This revelation, of course, devastated her emotionally. She said that if I truly loved her I would find everything physically about her as beautiful, that my not doing so was hurtful as not even her husband could find her beautiful and that no one else on earth would either. I'm depressed she's depressed and doesn't want me looking at her, touching her, kissing her, holding her, because how could I want that if I don't think her body is beautiful. I've told myself in the past that finding her visually attractive was not important compared with the physical, emotional and intellectual love that I bear her. I'm rambling....

I will be contacting a counselor and a few trusted people who also had/have overweight wives on how they address this, but what I was wondering from you is whether there is any way to remove the societal brainwashing that thin is beautiful from my scumbag brain.

I haven't the slightest clue, but I had to make this random account and write something, somewhere. It's this rage that I can't control. It's actually not just rage, it's emotions in general. I've always succumbed to my feelings and it hasn't taken me very far. I'd like to say to myself 'follow the path of the heart', but at times this is just a simple excuse to be pathetic. Which is not even my intention, it is simply the final result. During the last year I've had serious trouble drinking and conversing, because whenever I get excited I almost instantly burst into tears. I don't know why. It just happens. It's either that or the rage. I can't CONTROL IT. And it only happens around the people I love and consider to be my closest. So now I just try to conceal it all, to suffocate it, but that's a shitty strategy. Where will it take me? Probably to a place much worse than this one.

I want to quit smoking (cigs and grass together), I want to get back into a decent physical shape, I want to go out there and LIVE, but I can't do jack without my will. I seem to have lost that, which is inexcusable for a person at the age of 23. Or at least this is how the elderly see it. Sometimes it feels like I've grown into the body and mind of an old man. Withering in the shades of my room, embracing my PC and 'all it has to offer'. Playing games, one after another, going back to my fat days of laziness and nothing. I fell in love a few years ago and it ended badly, which I am sure most of you have experienced. But I didn't expect this to change me so much. I used to be a pretty calm guy, mostly laughing and making others laugh. Now... I'm pretty much the same guy, only the good sides of me don't emerge so often. My rage has closed the doors, and it appears far too often. I've started blaming others too much, and for things that derive from my own mind. It's like being the architect of my own demise. I watch behind my back, don't trust people that much and don't go out so much. Ironically, it feels like I've given up on my youth. The most priceless of all things. I fail to appreciate it and thus I am waiting for my free run to expire. Yes, I don't even have a job and still depend on my folks to support me. I am no virgin, but I rather be one that is in love with something. Or do I? Do I really want to go trough all those feelings again? I am not sure anymore. Well, frankly I do, but I am fucking scared of it. The tides have turned and my humble personality has devolved into a hater who accepts no foreign ideas, no strangers, no arguments. Even my best friends have noticed this darkness and they are slowly becoming alienated. This is all because of me. Even if I got burned - I can't treat people like they don't matter, but I still do it. I know how pathetic it is, so why? What must I do to re-ignite my will and start doing something with this life? The life I have is a gift I seldom acknowledge. At times I just waste it on senseless thoughts, lack of action, and degradation. I get the most excitement of knowing I've got some cash to buy weed, which I'd later smoke into oblivion and just 'feel normal' again. Needless to mention how many times I've said to myself 'don't do it this time, just do something else instead' and then went on to buy it again, slightly hating myself after. I don't like this whiny bitch, I want to have the power of INTENT. The power of will and desire to accomplish great things. How do I even begin to unleash that? What kind of thoughts would get me through the process? Because thinking about how others develop and blossom isn't having the greatest effect on me. When playing games it makes me competitive, but in life it makes me depressed. I promised myself to not compare others with me, but I can't help it.

Part of this is venting so I apologize for my language, or attitude.

This happens so many times to me, I am finally over a girl, who I find out does not like me, after a couple weeks of getting depressed and closing my shell to the world I begin to open up again, form new connections, get confident, have fun and truly enjoy myself. In school, or wherever I am. Then as I start talking more and more to girls, who I didn't really care for, I begin to notice one who has a amazing personality, is funny, smart, etc. and I am struck with emotion, and then I start doing this shit again. I begin thinking about this girl all the time, in anything I am doing, and when I go home I start to miss talking or seeing her. I get all worried and depressed and caught up in my thoughts, telling myself to not try to overthink the situation, but I can't! I always end up overthinking it and begin wanting to have a relationship. And the cycle starts.

But why am I mad? Well because I met a girl, we started talking, a little. But then after a while, we started talking A LOT. She started getting closer to me, laughing at my jokes, and joking back with me. She would tease me, punch my arm etc. She started also taking my hat, wearing it, and just giggling at me when I look at her across the room. My heart was out of this world, because I am a lonely fucking virgin who hasn't had a single relationship with a girl, and I finally start thinking that someone is interested. I wait a week to make sure she is not just being friendly, and she only steals my heat, and teases me, but not other guys. So I assume she is flirting, and as soon as I try to flirt back, by trying to let her wear my hat, she rejects my attempt to flirt, and gets all quite. I try to talk to her, but she seems weirded out, so I just go and sit down. I fucking hate this, honestly some days I realize that I have no chance with girls, and I wish I would go to sleep and not wake up. This always happens to me, my emotions take over and then I am devastated. I wish I didn't need to fall in love, I hate emotions, I really wish that I could just be alone, but not feel this shit.

1362001558.0,7,self.ihaveissues,19cq9w,[23F] Intimidated by dating guys better off than me,piledhigherndeeper,7,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/19cq9w/23f_intimidated_by_dating_guys_better_off_than_me/,"(Sorry in advance for the wall of text! If you actually read all of this, I love you for it.)

In all my past relationships, I've dated men who were from a similar background, particularly socioeconomic. Not intentional, I guess like attracts like. Looking back, it was nice to have that in common because there was a mutual understanding, and I was comfortable being totally open about my background.

Lately I've been trying to meet people, and I'm noticing a pattern. The guys I come across who are of a similar background tend to be on a lower intellectual level from me. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's like two different wavelengths, communication sucks. On the flip side, the guys I meet who are on the same wavelength are usually from much more comfortable backgrounds, if not affluent. It's common sense, I know, and I understand why I see this pattern.

My problem is that I'm intimidated by these guys who are better off--not to be mistaken for being bitter or resentful of their status. It's just that we come from really different worlds, and though I'm proud of the struggles my family and I have (and are still trying to) overcome, I feel this inexplicable shame. While we may be intellectual equals, they tend to be more worldly, having travelled to different countries and had all sorts of experiences. That ends up making me feel inferior, and intimidated. While I know I have my own redeeming qualities, I feel like I'm not ""good enough"" to date someone on that tier.

Add to that the fact that I'm not at all used to attractive guys being interested in me [more than casually]. The guys I've dated in the past have been physically ""below my league"" according to everyone (I didn't care, I was attracted and that's what mattered), so when I come across a guy who's smart, funny, all-around great, from a ""nice"" background, AND attractive, I'm left wondering, ""Why are you even talking to me?"" I'm beginning to think maybe I've settled in the past so I wouldn't have to feel inferior.

I'm fairly confident and happy in my own skin most of the time, but I feel like when I enter a relationship, that goes to shit. In my last relationship, even with someone with whom I felt comfortable, insecurities slowly crept up on me and had a pretty negative impact. So if I'm this intimidated just *meeting* a guy, how can I possibly date someone like this without getting totally engulfed by my insecurities?

I had a crush on this girl when I was 12/13. We would both talk for day and night whenever both of us got time and this carried on for years. We studied in same school but our talking in school was limited and mainly relied on internet communication. 

She was the only girl I was interested in and then fast forward 4 years. When I was 16, she started dating some other guy. Fast forward few months she told me she did breakup with her ex and she really liked me. We again started talking and very soon I realized she was using me only as a rebound guy to get her ex back. My estimate was right and exactly same happened. She broke up with me within a month and get back to her ex. I immediately cut off all communication with her and just told her to carry on with her life and wished her good luck for that.

It's been 2 years since ( we are 18 now) this incident and I have barely spoken to her. The only two messages I had hers were on my birthday and the only two I sent her was on her birthday.

I don't think i should include the name.

Anyways, for almost a year now, I have been dealing with the repercussions of having a breakdown.  I had dropped everything in desperation.  Luckily i found help, and to summarize it, i have slowly been making progress to re-enter my life.  

One way i started branching out was through the internet.  It seemed easier than going out and meeting my old friends, yet still getting the experience of being social.  It was a step in the right direction.  I would like to think that in some way i have made a difference and acquired friends in the process, but i guess that would be a bit of an exaggeration. Nevertheless i am proud of the progress i made.  In some instances, i have actively seeked out friendships/contact with specific people that i have met, and many of them reciprocated. 

So i thought as another step into the direction of facing my anxieties, I would approach this minor celebrity, in a small way, and consider it a victory if they just responded.  I had known about him for awhile, but only started trying to contact them this month.  I have tried numerous ways of talking to them, of contributing to the fandom, ultimately just to get his attention.  I see him respond to many people that i would say are exhibiting similar desperate habits, but never did he answer me.  It's gotten worse the last couple weeks; I have been messaging them more, sometimes anonymously to see if he would answer me but he did not.  I have started stalking his various social feeds, in order to find the right time where i could send him a message that he would most likely see.  I feel like all of this would stop if he just replied once!  I have so much in common with him, if he just gave me a chance he would know that!  Then again, that is also part of the problem, that i am over-identifying myself in him.

Some of my worse symptoms include: that he takes up my focus for most of the day, I fantasize about him, i have actually dreamt about him, and tonight i have not been able to fall asleep as i have been thinking of ways of how i can finally send the perfect message that he would respond to.  I have started imagining the worse as well: that he may have gotten the wrong idea about me, or read into my desperation and black-listed me.  That he thinks i am some sort of predator and he black-listed me.  I have been more mad at them than at myself, which in some way is progress since much of my initial problems have stemmed from self-blame. 

The tl;dr is basically the title, but please read the details as i think they are very important for you to know about before you respond.  Thank you.

EDIT: I just wanted to add something i forgot to mention, I have also developed a crush on him.  I think he is so cute.  I want him to be my friend.

We spoke on the phone last night and everything feels so much better. We're not hastily leaping into a relationship, but we're continuing our patterns like we have been (ie, talking every few days, writing snailmail to each other... we do that... and just slowly continuing to get to know each other and build a foundation of trust and friendship with no unrealistic expectations)

He's just as skeptical of relationships as I am, but we reassured each other of our strong feelings and needs for careful, casual and delicate approaches to this considering the distance, my busy life, and his.

Everything was going fine until her husband left on vacation and she started hooking up with a mutual friend who also works here and who also happens to be engaged to a very lovely women, although she doesn't work here.

I found out through another friend who works here and it seems very likely.

He waits for her after work, I see them together all the time and they have become unabashedly flirty, all signs point to it being true.

Since I found out I've felt very conflicted, jealous, angry, sad, ashamed and embarrassed. 

Before I would admire her and wish the best for her and her husband (he seemed like a decent guy, even though she openly complained about him constantly).  Now I'm just bitter and disappointed. 

Most of all I've been very quiet, distant and just don't have the wherewithal to be the outgoing fun office comedian anymore which she has noticed the most.

Since she is my boss, it's her job to make sure that I'm okay and she keeps badgering me everyday wanting to know why I'm acting differently and not cracking jokes or being myself, esp around her.

She still acts as if we are all cool and friendly and it's driving me crazy.

I don't know if my fiance reads this subreddit or not and I would rather him not know about me letting our laundry out for everyone to see it.

To give a little background, my fiance(m19) and I have been together for a little over four years. For me, it was kind of love at first sight, as cliche as that is. We dated a few other people before finally getting together in my sophomore year of high school. He is my best friend, he's stood by my through everything from my father fighting cancer, my many panic attacks and other little drama to my last step walking across the stage at graduation.

May of my senior year, he proposed to me (without a ring. I mean, we were high school students, who has the money for an engagement ring in their Junior year?) and I said yes. He promised that the day he graduated (June 2012) we would tell his parents about us and by my birthday, I would have a ring.

I understood about wanting to wait to tell his family, but we agreed to tell my own. While happy for us, they were apprehensive to really believe in the proposal. Now, almost two years later, I understand why. After graduation, things fell through and he had to move an hour or so away to live with his grandparents. 

I thought it was no big deal. We survived a year with minimum face to face time, we can do it again for a few months until things settle down. It's been 8 months since he moved away, but we still see one another about once a month.

I've asked him multiple times about when he was going to tell his family. I keep getting the same answer: it's not the right time/I will next month when things settle down. Well, things have settled down. He has a job, he's going to school and if his grandparents settle down any more, they'll be dead. (No offense to his grandparents, I really do love them.) 

Again, I understand him not telling his parents right now while things are still very heated between them, but he should be able to tell his grandparents! Nothing has changed between us, he still acts the same way with me as he did before we got engaged. I still love him with all my heart and soul.

Please, be honest, is there something I'm totally missing here? Is there a way I can finally convince him to tell his parents? Because as much as I don't want it to come down to this, if he can't tell his family that I'm his fiance, I won't claim him as my husband.

I’m 18 year old, male immigrant who moved to the US about 9 years ago. It was a new experience to me and it took time for me to understand the new culture and society. But soon my life turned from okay to horrible. My father started lying about everything, and emotional manipulated me by telling me that my mom as cheating on him, even though she wasn't. He manipulated me into hating her and her side of the family. But it all blew over when my mom found out that he was manipulating me. There were huge fights, and it angered me that my father had treated me like that. I felt used, and horrible. At one point anger took over me so much that I pushed him out of house, and he ended up living in the car for the whole day. (He came back home the next day.) We all still live together, but my mother and father don’t get along. They don’t even sleep in the same bedroom. I hate the fact that it’s always awkward at home. I hate the fact that we can’t even eat dinner together. My mother has crazy anger problems, and whenever she gets mad, she acts like the whole world should apologize to her. I hate the fact that I have to live like this. It’s been making me depressed for the last 3 years. I feel like I didn’t deserve any of this. I hate the fact that my father has showed me no affection, or ever helped me in my life. Nobody has ever encouraged me for anything. I essentially only started studying harder because I wanted to disappear from this hellhole of a life as soon as possible. Therefore for a while my only motivation in life was my education.
I have no place and no one to express my emotion to. Now whenever my emotion gets the best of me. I just wait until night and hug my pillow and play out scenarios like it’s a real person or some shit, and talk to it (not literally loudly, more like in my brain). I’ve also cried multiple nights for some unknown, depressing reason. I’m also slightly OCD (not professional diagnosis, self diagnosed)

I’m losing all closeness with God, and am disinterested in going to church anymore. I hate going to our little Asian (I’m Asian) church because they’re all a bunch of gossiping showoffs. I’m also embarrassed to go there, mostly because my father told them all lies about my family. But today I went to an English church. It wasn’t enlightening or anything. But I cried a lot when the priest started talking about how this year was a test, and that next year it would be better for all of us. I’m pretty emotional anyways. I usually cry when in anger rather than fight.

But this winter break (which started a week ago), I’ve felt really depressed, and have been crying a lot. I’ve been thinking about things and realized a couple of things. I’ve felt like I’ve barely made any friends. I’ve had friends, but I’ve never felt any real connection with them. I have no social life, and no hobbies. But I’ve always wanted to give a hand at acting, or singing. I’m too scared to try though, and don’t know of any opportunities to try my “skill” at so that I can receive feedback.
Christmas was supposed to be spent with family and was supposed to enrich everyone with happiness. (Those Christmas/Disney commercials about having a jolly Christmas didn’t help.) But instead it just depressed me because we just sat at home without any of my extended family, because my family somehow has the ability to almost not get along with anyone. My self-esteem was never high. I’m overweight, and cross-eyed. I’ve felt like I can never trust anyone, because of my father’s emotional manipulating ways. I know it’s kind of sounds stupid that I can’t trust anyone because every individual is different, but when it comes to trusting anyone with anything, I always hold back. I also had a short (4-5 month) relationship with a girl about 3 years ago, but we broke up after she used me to get to someone else that she found better to date. I also stopped dating because I’m just no longer interested in dating. I’m not an asexual though. I’ve became overweight, but I’ve started working on losing it by running every day. I’ve come to realize that I hate my life, and hate every aspect of it. I’ve been severally depressed over the past few days because of the winter break, with nothing to do, and noone to do anything with.

I’m going to college by September of 2013. Hopefully it’s somewhere far away from home, where I can start a new life. I LITERALLY dream of a day where I can finally have someone who cares about me. Every time I try to reach out to my cousins, they all deny that everything in my life is abnormal, and tell me to deal with it.

So I’m wondering: Am I crazy? Am I just viewing all the events in my life as a big deal? What should I do? How do I also prevent this from affecting me in the future? I don’t want to grow up being depressed or being weird as shit. I’ve always wanted to be normal, and live a normal childhood. Also I cannot afford a therapist/counselor yet, hence the reason I'm asking for advice online.

So right now, I'm on my college break. I have two jobs, one hosting karaoke and trivia nights at random bars, and the other is working in an independently owned game store. I live in an apartment with a roommate. My parents pay for my share of rent, my car, and schooling thought loans while I pay for the rest of my necessities. Mid-way through the year I started dating a girl(f19) who's pretty great. I mean, she's not my usual choice in women but hey, she treats me better than any other girl I've ever had.

Well, even with all of these positives in my life, I feel like shit all the time. I'm severely depressed and suicidal. I have no plans to end my life because I know that would make people sad but every day I wish I could take a gun to my head. I've always been depressed but it was the beginning of this year that really got me into the hell hole I'm in.

Jan. 23 around 11pm I called my other girlfriend(f19) (We'll call here ""M"") to see how she was doing. This girl was the woman of my dreams, I'd fallen in love with her two years prior to dating but it was only when I found out she actually like me that I made an attempt at her. I'm by no means unattractive. I'd like to believe I'm a 7.5 or 8, but she was a goddess to me. (I have a think for red-heads) Anyway, when I called her that day, she told me that she had cheated on me the previous night. I was devastated. I drank and got drunk every night for 3 and a half months. I packed her shit out of my place and told her to never talk to me again. That lasted a week. I then asked for her back. She said she need time to think about it and need space. My dumb ass couldn't take that so I'd text her every few days to see how she was and she would just get pissed. Also at some point during all this I attempted suicide and was in a hospital metal ward for a week. I don't remember at what point. It was a very hazy 3.5 months. Anyway. After a month of waiting for her to respond she told me she didn't want to be with me. I broke down and cried. I also slept with one of my friends that night. (The beginning of me becoming a man whore)

So, after losing her, I went out every night. Got wasted while completely ignoring school. I lost all my savings because of this and I'm still recovering from it. I'd pick up random girls and go have sex with them. It was fun for me. It filled a void that she left. Over time I cooled it with the drinking to about 4 times a week but still whored myself out. My friends were worried but I would just laugh and tell them I'm just enjoying myself. No worries, right? Secretly, I was still a mess and 4 months in, I still missed the girl of my dreams.

After 5 months, ""M"" contacted me. She wanted to see how I was doing. We talked. I told her I loved and missed her. She became distant again for obvious reasons. I went back to the drinking.

I made attempts to date other women, but most of the time wreaked it in one way or another. My friend who I was sleeping with at the time  sort of hates me now because of my absolute moronic handling of our ""relationship.""

At some point ""M"" contacted me again. I don't know why, but I agreed to it. I knew it wouldn't be healthy to talk to her, but I did. We met for coffee and our talk went great. It felt like I was with the girl I loved again, but...I knew we weren't. That ate at me. When we talked, she mentioned how she slept with various other guys after me. I was her first. That somehow really hurt me. I cried once I got home. After feel like I was gonna lose my mind, I had her come over to my place one last time to talk about us. I told her I can't take being just her friend. It hurts to much to know she's happy with other guys. She said she still loved me and I told her I loved her. However, she wanted something different than to feel attached to me. I told her I don't want her to feel like she's committed to me, but she couldn't see that. I held her in my arms for what felt like years. I didn't want to let go of the person I loved so much. She wanted badly for us to still be friends or something. She didn't care how fucked up it was, as long as I was still somewhat in her life. I told her I was in a fucked up relationship with a woman I loved before. It didn't work. Finally she gave up. I told her I'd do everything to forget her from this point on and that she should forget me. She said she would never forget me. We hug one last time. I told her she meant nothing to me after that and she left. I didn't even look at her go. I cried for about an hour, left, got drunk, and fucked a different friend.

2 months passed and I did nothing. I didn't go to work. I didn't go to school. I just drank and fucked. I felt like the biggest piece of shit, but on the outside I tried to show everyone that I was really just the greatest person in the world.

Things calmed down after I stated dating uh...let's call her ""N."" She's caring and loving to me. I think I love her...but idk. I don't feel about her like I did ""M."" I still have dreams/nightmares about ""M"" almost every day. I long to have her back...but know it's foolish. She cheated on me. She doesn't deserve me, but yet...I don't care. I want to believe things will be great between me and ""N,"" but idk. I'm afraid one day I'll leave her and hurt her. I just want to not be the piece of shit I am anymore and start big idk...whole?

Thing is, this came as news to me - I told my ex a funny story from my childhood, about my parents pretending to abandon me in the woods! Apparently that's not as funny as I thought, and she was quite upset - I don't remember much of my childhood, just little bits and pieces - my parents telling us they were getting divorced, the time my mum threw me into a wall, making me late for school (and how, when I explained the situation to my teacher, I got in trouble for being late *and* telling lies), the last time my mum tried to slap me - when I blocked her, and was then forced to call my dad and tell him that I'd hit her.

...Sorry, I kind of digressed from my point there - but it's not something I can talk to actual people about (no offense, but I have to think of you all as fake people before I can manage to talk about myself) so there's some venting to be done!


Anyway, the main point I was going to make is - courtesy of this, I have incredibly shitty self-esteem. I can't stand my face, or my body, I'm all but incapable of initiating conversations because I don't like to intrude or interrupt, I'm flat-out incapable of recognising (and believing) when/if women are attracted to me, and most of all I can't let anyone see how miserable I am - I've been faking functionality so long that pretty much no-one even knows I have problems, they just think I'm quiet.


Now that I'm starting to see how fucked bits of my past are, I'm realising how screwed up my self-image is - but how the hell am I supposed to go about fixing it? Since breaking up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago (Well, someone else's girlfriend, which didn't help with the inability to trust!) pretty much my entire emotional support structure is my step-cousin who A: is nine years my junior and B: has a crush on me that was cute when she was a kid, but is worrying now that she's a teenager - I feel like a massive creep whenever I hit her up for support, like I'm taking advantage of her feelings, but sometimes I just need to talk to someone that I know I can trust, y'know?

If they hadn't been the aggressor like that, we would've never become friends. I don't know why exactly I've always been so passive, but my best guess is that I needed that confirmation that someone likes me, and until I get it I will feel like I would be overstepping my bounds (even though I know this isn't true, it still feels like it) if I were to be the first one to make a move. I also just realized that this applies to even facebook. I've probably only actively friended less than 10 people on facebook, and they were all people I was really close friends with. All the others have friended me. 

Also, I've never tried to pursue a romantic relationship. I've never once hit on a girl. I know it sounds like I must just have low self esteem, but I really don't feel I do. I feel that this hold-up when it comes to initiating things is its own separate issue. Maybe it was born out of my insecurities and low self esteem in the past, but at this point it seems that it's just become such an ingrained habit that it's just carrying on by its own momentum. 

Over the years, I have had a few girls that I had feelings for be the aggressor and tell me that they liked me before I told them. But even in these situations, nothing has really ever come of it because for whatever reason I was still passive about it and didn't do much to further anything along. I waited for them to, which never happened and I knew it wouldn't happen. This might even be a separate issue, but on some sick level I think I enjoy withholding success from myself. There was a girl I was really into and she told me that she liked me too and at that point I never initiated anything. I always let her text me, let her call me, and eventually she just stopped. I'm not confused as to why, and I don't blame her. But part of me enjoyed watching something that I wanted so much (and truly felt I deserved) slip out of my grasp. It's like a sick thrill. Knowing that I could be doing so much and that I'm not. I think part of it at least is that I enjoy feeling sorry for myself. It's weird to admit that but it's true. I've burned many bridges by not being active and I actually enjoy it, although of course I hate it at the same time. Kind of like how a junkie might love their drug even though they hate what it's doing to their life.

I was raped this past May by a friend. Long story short, I haven't dated or gone out with any guys since. However, all I can think about is kissing my most recent ex. We dated before the incident and he doesn't know it happened. 

This may sound strange, but I'd really just like to feel like not all guys want sex from me. I don't want the last memory of someone kissing me to be my rape. My ex is the only one I've thought about this with and I think it's because I know he doesn't want me-- and I don't want him. There's no threat.

 I'm terrified to date again, though I've tried, but being in college, I'm scared that I'd be asking too much from any guy remotely interested in me. No 20 something college guy wants to hear after a few weeks of dating, ""Sorry, I'm going to need you to jump through hoops so I can trust you as well as wait an indefinite amount of time before I'll even consider sex again.""

I'm at a roadblock-- I've coped enough with the incident on my own that I'm obviously functioning and doing well for myself. However, I'm lonely and I can't get over the incident any further because I'm too scared to take a chance on anyone.

I met John in university when I was dating his friend. John and I had an immediate connection and it very quickly took over what I felt for his friend. We would talk for hours about any and everything. The mental and physical connection we have is indescribeable. Emotionally, however, there was never much there. We both realized soon enough that we had a thing for watching each other get off and we shared a mutual love for all things Tantra. I'll make this simple: With all of our other partners, we had to learn how to have an orgasm, ie: actively think about and focus until we came. With each other, it was the opposite. We had to fight to not orgasm a minute or so in. We are two sides of the same coin it seemed, our energy was parallel... even intertwined.

Sadly, we lost contact. Fast forward 6 years and we meet up for coffee. Its like not a day went by since we last saw each other. He is now married, and I've been seeing someone for a few months. We know we want each other, there is not getting around this fact. He asks me if I believe there are certain people who are meant to be in your life... I do believe that. He asks me what I would do to keep those people in my life. I can see where he is going with this, we never want to stop being in each others lives. We don't want the conversations to end, the advice to stop, and the incredible moments of ecstacy to be lost. 

I know I should feel like this is wrong. He's married to a wonderful, beautiful woman. I'm seeing someone really hot (there's not much else to say for him TBH). He loves her, I know this... But I feel like a sociopath in that I cannot see whats so wrong with getting off with someone you feel so connected to and leaving it there. I've never felt any desire to date him or bring him to parties, dinner, etc... In spite of (and considering) all I've said, Reddit, should I stop?

Have a field day, r/ihaveissues.",alquimista77,9,0,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/132rca/23f_abusive_relationship_after_abusive/,"Ok. So I'm trying to figure my shit out, and hopefully someone here can put me on the right track.

August 2 years ago, I met this guy, Jake,who I fell insanely in love with. We were together until May, in a relationship that involved repeated cheating, and even blackmail and me getting hit once. It's difficult to explain how truly fucked up it was that I loved him and thought I couldn't live without him- but, that's what happened. I was on off with him until August, during which time I was dating this other guy- honestly to help me deal with the pain of leaving Jake. I haven't felt as strongly for anyone in the 2 years and a few months since we met.

Then I left the country. I managed to be single for a few months- you'll laugh, but it was a major achievement for me. I'd always felt worthless unless I was in a relationship with a guy. Being single for a few months in a new place was a huge deal for me. It's very hard for me to go without sex for a long period of time (a month or more), and masturbation just isn't enough, so I often have hook ups when I'm single.  I was hooking up with one guy for a few months in my single-ness though, Mustafa. Mustafa had a rough sex fetish, I used to come home with half my body blue and black. Never my face though, except for once on my lip. I really enjoyed that, which also feels fucked up. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I'm putting it in here because it feels important. Anyway, Mustafa did some things which were pretty damn disrespectful. I am actually too embarrassed to write them down here.

Then I met this new guy Joaquin, and we dated for a few months. I think it's a stretch to call Joaquin abusive, though other people have told me he was. Basically he called me fat and insulted my appearance and kept trying to change me (I'm 5""6 105-110ish). There is one other thing, my best friend has a big problem with it. Once we were in bed, and I told him I really didn't want sex without a condom. He kept asking. Then he just put it in anyway. When I yelled at him he took it out. 

Then I went backpacking, hooked up with a few guys, one who I fell for hardcore who was also pretty damn mean to me. Said I looked young ""for a 34 year old."" and that kind of thing. Called me like a dog at one point, which pissed me off. Obviously that's over. 

So I came home, managed to be single for a month or so, and I've been hooking up with someone who's 35 (he looks 24, it's unbelievable.) We've been hooking up for a month and I was debating whether or not to make it serious. He's a nice person, as far as I can tell. Me and some friends ran into him at a bar a few nights ago, and he was beyond trashed, and it was kind of embarrassing. I now feel like I want to keep him for sure as only a hook up. I guess I don't think someone who's 35 should be acting the way he usually does, at least not the kind of person I'd want a relationship with. 


So. If someone could tell me what's wrong with me, or what steps to take..I just feel like there's something there that's super wrong with me, and I have no idea what it is. It's like all the wires in me are tangled and knotted up. And if I was straightened out, I wouldn't always find the men that I do AND STAY WITH THEM. I'd like to have a long term relationship with someone kind, and that I love and he loves me and all. It will sound so simple to all of you. ""If you find a guy that's a douchebag, leave him."" But I can't. I get this feeling like I can't live without them, and the pain is overwhelming. There is something seriously wrong, and I don't know how to fix it. 

TL;DR I always wind up with terrible men (with the exception of the most recent one), tell me what I'm doing wrong.

Same thing every time [M21],whatiswrongdude,8,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/130hz4/why_cant_i_maintain_a_relationship_same_thing/,"So here is my story. I [M21] seem to have little issues starting a relationship and developing initial attraction.  A little background info about me:  I am definitely attractive, have lots of friends, have goals and hobbies, and go to school.  I am not a deadbeat.

Anyways, I always seem to start a relationship and develop initial attraction with a girl.  This will usually start with a hookup, and I will usually not know her very well, or at all, before we initially hookup and begin ""seeing eachother"".  Then we will talk/text a lot and usually hangout very frequently, anywhere from twice a week to every day.  Everything will seem to be going fine, and sometimes at the beginning I will try my best to not ""like"" her very much in fear of getting attached.  (I seem to always be over attached).  Initially she may even contact me a lot more than I contact her, and she will appear to like me a lot more.  

The fucking second I decide beyond reasonable doubt that I do like her, shit goes wrong.  I do not know what the fuck I do.  I cannot sense that I act any differently towards her other than beginning to contact her more often and initiate a convo more than before.  When this happens she usually begins to lose interest and I start fucking worrying a lot.  Once they know I like them, they stop liking me! If they like me too much, I start reconsidering if I can do better!

After this happens, I will begin texting them more and they will blow me off, causing me to become very sad and worrisome, constantly thinking about her.  It will eventually dwindle down and they will completely stop talking to me, or I will fucking EXPLODE and pour my feelings out to them like an emotional bitch and this will push them away further.

In the last relationship I developed which seems to have nearly come to an end I met her [F24] at a bar.  Hooked up the first night. I made sure to not be overly conversive the first entire month but she would always contact me and text me everyday! over this period i went back and forth deciding whether i actually like her or not.  After a little over a month I decided that I indeed, did like her and want to be her BF.  Then she started to gradually begin to lose interest! why?

At the beginning she showed all signs of wanting to be with me.  She would be all over me in public, and around my friends, and would text me multiple times if i did not reply.  Now it is the other way around, and the other day after 2 months i bring up dating for the first time (in person) ans she is suddenly ""too busy"".  What am i doing wrong every time?  Why do they lose interest once i show commitment?  Am i picking the wrong girls?  The last girl had just got ut of a 3 year relationship 2 months before i met her? please help.

TL; DR:  history is repeating itself. cannot ever get past 2 month mark in a relationship.  I suppress feelings at beginning and the girl will be all over me.  Once i show interest they lose feelings for me.  I have always felt overly clingy in relationships and driven girls away but in my most recent one I MADE SURE not to do this.

Our relationship has been very open, as we both have told each other a lot about our lives.  For me though, there's one part of my life that I feel would change how our relationship will go and how he'd feel about me afterwards.

Years ago into our relationship I had told him about one thing in my life that I regretted, and he said that he wouldn't have thought I was the kind of person to do that sort of thing. After telling him that he had wondered if there were any other secrets, and at the time I didn't say there was any when in fact there still is one secret.  Our relationship didn't change much after that, but I feel like a horrible person for not telling him about this secret.  I've been worried ever since then that if I tell him the last secret that he'll think of me as someone unlike the person he's been with for the past 4 years.

We've had some discussions about how there really isn't more to know about the other. However whenever they come up I struggle with either wanting to tell him and to keep my mouth closed and not really answer.  I know it's basically lying in that regard, and I feel awful for not telling him the full truth.

TL;DR Afraid of the idea of losing bf from some shit I did in the past.  This has been eating me up for too long and I just want to let it go without losing him too.


**Edit**
Since it was wondered about what the secret is I'll tell it here.  It happened when I was about 17 going to 18 I think.  I'm sorry if this is vague, but I can't honestly remember timelines near the end and right after high school.  What happened was that my older brother, on more than one occasion, touched my breasts.  I think it was more experimental than anything, but the thing is I allowed it to happen.  It went for a long while until I had enough of it, and refused to even do it anymore.

I essentially ignored my brother for anything other than what he found was funny on the internet or something.  If it was anything else I'd just move myself out and not interact again.  There had been times in between then and a little before I met my boyfriend where I think he tried to get at it again.  But I was done, and just didn't want anymore of it or even think about it because it left me feeling wrong on too many levels.

In recent times I've tried to reconnect with my siblings (due to other things going on and me barely connecting with them other wise).  With reconnecting other siblings, it also involves my older brother.  It hasn't been said between either of us about that part of the past, but all I can think is that maybe my brother has also regretted that time too.  At some point in life I wish to discuss it with him, at least to acknowledge it as stupid shit and try to be done with that.",,False,,t5_2s90u,1351869324.0,,,True,t3_12i8o9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/12i8o9/23yo_f_ive_been_struggling_with_deciding_whether/,

 i was just so afraid of making myself look like some sort of creep, afraid of rejection, afraid of everything, i don't really know. but i never really got a chance to actually *be* with her. she knew i had feelings for her, and i knew she had feelings for me, but because she was fickle and indirect and i was self-conscious and paranoid, it never turned into anything from there. at all. we were just sort of in this grey area with each other. 

eventually she found another guy, dated him for a long time, went off to college and turned into a completely different person. drinking and partying all the time, hanging out with total douchebags constantly, just completely changed. i haven't seen her in a while, but the last time i did, she just told me she missed being my friend.

I asked her one thing and that was to keep out friendship the same way that it was. Our Friendship was kind of unique we hung out 2-4 hours per day and yesterday we spent 7 hours together at the mall and watching movies. our friendship also consists of lots of talking and sometimes hugs. This is all fun and games and okay to her but for me its okay as well except for the fact that how I know she doesn't like me. and its like my heart is controlling my emotions, because its telling me that she likes me but in my mind i know this will never happen. like when we have some eye contact. Or just spending a lot of time together talking about everything.

although my mind knows nothing is going to happen, my heart gives me unrealistic answers to everything. for one example yesterday we watched a movie and she offered me if I wanted to see another one, I politely denied because I had to go home, so after she left and I'm on the bus ride home I start feeling like shit. and my mind is telling me ""oh what if you saw another movie something could of happened"".

And these thoughts raid me of my life and honestly I feel like they are consuming my state of mind. I feel like I'm going insane because of how much time I spend thinking about her, some other things I feel are pushing this over the limit are; when I go to sleep I pretend my blanket is (fake name here) and sometimes i even act our scenarios with it or kiss it imagining it is her just to get that feeling again. (the same feeling i feel when I'm around her) I really need your guy's help with this.

Tl:DR

I spent too much time thinking about this girl that I most likely will never have a chance with, we are very close and spend maybe 20 hours a week together (including school). I do a lot of weird things to compensate my emotions when I'm not around her for example I would envision scenarios about us going to the movies think about kissing her and just spending ""love"" time with her. Another thing I would do is pretend my blanket is the girl (fake name here), and I would cuddle with it and watch movies pretending its her. (so pathetic I know) and when i don't do these things i go crazy... like my mind is flooded with unrealistic thoughts about her. I really need help to get control of my life.

Now that I'm looking at things a bit more rationally, I think it belongs here instead.

In June of this year, my girlfriend left me. We'd been best friends since we were 12. We'd dated seriously throughout high school and into our first year of college. In June, she went to some convention with a guy friend she'd just met. I was very iffy about it, and my suspicions were confirmed when she got back; she'd slept with him and did not hesitate to leave me for him.

I'm an idiot so we kept in contact. This guy went off to boot camp a few weeks after they got together, and while he was gone she would come to me crying every time she began to miss him, and would mention how glad she was that we were still friends. Of course as soon as he got back (having failed boot camp), she dropped all contact with me. I doubt he even knows we spoke.

The few times we discussed it, she blamed her cheating on me, calling me a loser and telling me that I'd been a bad boyfriend. I don't really know what I did wrong, but it's seriously haunting me. The depression was awful for the first month, to the point that I lost quite a bit of weight due to the fact that every time I ate food I'd just vomit it back up. That's become more manageable since then, but in the last few weeks (i.e. since she dropped all contact with me) I've developed insomnia and I absolutely despise it.

This was my first serious relationship, and I kind of feel like I'm crazy for taking the breakup so hard. I guess I should mention that I've always had Social Anxiety Disorder and a bad home life so she was there to help me, and now she's not. For a while it was extremely easy to talk to people, but since June it's just been awful. I go to school, I work out, then I come home and do absolutely nothing for hours. I have no motivation to do anything. My friends have stopped hanging out with me outside of school because I've ""changed,"" whatever that means.

Seriously, how the hell do I get past this? I had therapy in high school for suicidal thoughts due to unrelated issues (see: ""bad home life"") and it just made me feel worthless. I'm afraid I'm going to have to get therapy again but I really don't want to. It's embarrassing.

I want to get over this, but every time I start to approach someone new I have terrible anxiety attacks. I just don't understand why someone that I loved so much and had spent so much time with would go out of her way to hurt me when I was happy for the first time. It's like she wanted to fuck me up.

I really know no one here and I'm really having a lot of trouble getting out there and making friends. I'm living out of my step-dad's house which is convenient because I'm not making much money but it's isolated. 

I found a job, well two of them, writing/editing gigs at a magazine and newspaper respectively, but the catch is that I'm working from home. This isn't what I want at all. I want to write/edit and these are jobs in the right field but I don't want to work from home. I need more structure than that. 

It occurred to me that I think I'm getting depressed. I haven't had much of an appetite for the past month or so, haven't eaten anything except a banana today. I just don't want to eat. On top of that, I don't want to work on my work stuff (I do it anyway) and I don't do any of the creative writing I was doing for myself. 

I'm paying more and more attention to stupid games like Magic The Gathering and Kerbal Space Program. I really need to get out there and meet people but I just don't know what to fucking do. 

I don't know where I'd find places to go even if I were to go somewhere. And when I do find somewhere to go, I don't want to do it alone even though there isn't another option. I don't want to leave my house and all I want to do is leave my house.

I know that if I don't want to do anything, I should definitely go do something but I don't know. I don't know where I'd go. Actually that's just the excuse I have. My real excuse is that I don't know how to move this concrete wall in front of me.

It's driving me crazy, and I just want to talk to him about it, but because he's so distant he hates conversations like that. If I bring up feelings, he gets a ""deer in headlights"" look and doesn't talk or answer questions. He just changes the subject as fast as he can. 

A little background, I have a history of being insecure in relationships. In my last relationship (4 years), I was constantly questioning his intentions. I broke up with him because I couldn't handle it anymore, and found out later that he was planning on proposing the next month. I felt terribly about second-guessing what we had, until I found out that he had cheated on me three times during our relationship, once with my best friend. So I was at least a little right to be suspicious. 

I'm afraid that this pattern of constantly questioning things is going to continue to ruin relationships for me until I figure out what's going on (either with myself or with the relationship). I don't want to drive him away with pestering him about feelings, but right now I feel like I could be anyone. I feel like I'm just a warm body to cuddle with at night with no strings attached. If we broke up, I feel like he'd be fine within the hour. 

Does anyone have any perspective on this? How should I go about talking about this (if I should bring it up at all)? Do I need to get help on trust issues and my various neuroses left over from being cheated on and not cared about in the past?

None of those dates ended in a solid relationship. A couple I ended up in their beds, but that's not, ultimately, what I'm going after. I'm afraid though that it seems to women that IS the only thing I'm looking for. I've only had one sexual partner and it was a 2 night stand back in college, before any of these dates. When I say I ended up in beds, we were just fooling around, never any sex. Due to the fact that my sex drive is very high, I think that it clouds my judgement and I find that I can't handle a first couple of dates without pushing for physical contact.

That's just what I feel though, is that if I can find physical, sexual contact from someone that I will be less horny all the time and able to focus on building a meaningful foundation with someone that we can build from.

I also find it incredibly difficult to open up emotionally to people. There's a nagging barrier deep within my ""feelings matrix"" (located roughly in my solar plexus - just a silly name to describe those ""gut feelings"" that you get when you're sad, happy, joyful, etc.) that I imagine is some form of anxiety. I don't know where it came from, but it's there.

The last thing that bugs me is that I don't feel like I could comfortably be physically close to a woman until i'm down to a ""normal"" size. I guess the easiest way to hash that is that I'm very self conscious of my weight. When I've been physically intimate with women, my instinct takes over and I'm no longer self-conscious, but I often feel shameful after fantasizing while masturbating or after fooling around with a woman (damn you puritanical roots!).

Simply, I want to share part of my life with another individual that I am romantically involved with, I want to have a regular sex life with them, and I'm afraid that I won't ever manage to get there.

Some important notes from my past and my current situation that may help with responses:

* Overweight, probably could be considered obese. I am working on this by adjusting my diet and becoming more active
* Father passed away when I was 11 which means I was raised exclusively by my mother. The closest good father figure I had in my life lived over 1000 miles away.
* Being raised Christian, I was taught that masturbation was bad (I did it anyway and still do) and that my body was something to be ashamed of.
* I often get chastised by friends saying that I'm very blunt and abrasive, and when I try not to be I just come off as insincere
* I don't know as that I've ever had someone that felt love toward except my parents and my siblings.
* I'm not particularly ugly, I'm hygienically sound and have a decent fashion sense (thank you /r/malefashionadvice) 
* Most of my friends have been verbally abusive, teased me about being overweight (middle school and high school) and more recently in professional life outside of college, all of my friends are very aggressive and dominant, and often call me fag, queerbait, dumbass, thick, dumb etc. ""Find new friends"" is the common solution, however I've only lived in this city for 1 year and have found it difficult to meet people outside of okcupid dates and work.
* I have a condition called [low latent inhibition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_inhibition#Low_latent_inhibition)

Any advice would be wonderful. If anyone is willing to PM me and become an online friend, it might be useful to have someone to chat with. Men and women both welcome, however women might be able to lend a better perspective in most cases to the issues I""m dealing with. Thanks in advance for your time.

EDIT: Edited to add that my roommate/housemate is very aggressive and is the one who mostly calls me names like queerbait and fag.

EDIT2: Hopefully last edit - forgot to mention that I've been told multiple times by reddit and by friends that I get clingy really fast. I don't know why this is, but if I like someone a lot or felt a great chemistry with them after the first date, I freak out over receiving contact from them. It is really unreasonable and I hate it about myself, but it just happens. This is all internal, by the way. I don't share that clinginess to the individual I feel attracted to or directly to my friends/coworkers, but friends and coworkers often notice it, and I can't imagine most women would miss it, though I don't have my face to face time with them after the first date.",,False,,t5_2s90u,1347317897.0,,,True,t3_zoctt,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/zoctt/23m_having_trouble_dating_sharing_my_emotions/,

Since we moved in together in January, I've had a really hard time coping with the huge change of merging your life with another person's. Our incredible, beautiful relationship started to slowly deteriorate as I became angry, paranoid, and lashed out in mood swings at my fiance.

I have [borderline personality disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) and it's debilitating in relationships to say the least.  I've been in abusive relationships, emotionally charged anger-oriented relationships, and a few good ones along the way too.  I strongly suspect that I may have been sexually abused as a child, with no real way to prove it, but it would explain my paranoia about my fiance leaving me despite the emotional hell I've put him through.

Three weeks will go by without a hitch, then an explosive emotional episode will follow--me flying into a rage about something as small as asking him to take the trash out, yelling and screaming at him, throwing personal insults, all in a disassociative stupor that sometimes leaves me grasping for a clearer memory of what I said.  It leaves us both extremely damaged and discouraged about the state of the relationship, but he is amazing enough to pick up and keep going.

I am in therapy and taking a mood stabilizer and things are getting better, but I am so afraid that I'm going to keep doing irreparable damage to myself and my relationship until it runs us both into the ground.

I'm not sure if it deals with trust/trying to push people away etc. but it's sucking the life out of me. 

Recently, I had a rough few weeks with my boyfriend where he was unsure of our relationship, needing to take time to sort out some of his issues before we could move forward. He did that, assured me that the issue had been dealt with and that we could move on in the relationship. Even though this was the outcome, he apologized for some of his actions (not cheating, just avoiding me and not communicating properly), I can't seem to get over it. He's a wonderful person and I have no other reason not to trust him when he tells me that everything is OK - but the last three occasions we've spent time together, I haven't been able to stop myself from re-hashing things and bringing up the past arguments, being repetitive etc. 

I feel like I'm not in control of my behaviour and I don't know how to stop micro-analysing everything that he does...looking for clues to see if he's going to break up with me, calling him on what would normally be run-of-the-mill situations. Making small scenarios into big stressful arguments because one little thing sets me off. It's so destructive, and he finally told me today that it's making him feel like he doesn't want to spend time with me and that it makes him feel less towards me, which makes me feel less secure and makes me act more irrationally - a vicious cycle. 

The above is just a general example, but it's a pattern in my head and my actions that has played out over all of my relationships and has made things really stressful. I feel an intense sense of loneliness and inability to move on at the same time. I'm not sure how to stop.

Female, age 20. My mother has extremely pale/white skin (to where people have a hard time believing she is filipino) while my dad has the typical tanned color. I'm a combo of both where people often believe that I'm mixed judging by the shade of my skin.

I have my own body insecurities like most people and most of them are pretty simple. I'm overweight (5'2"" at 166 lbs. being my highest), but I'm on the course to being 115 lbs. and have lost almost 20 lbs. That is something I feel like I have control over so, it really isn't that big of an issue. What I don't have control over is the pigmentation of my skin.

Logically, I know better. I know that there's nothing wrong with how my skin is. But deep down inside I feel as though the ultimate form of being pretty is someone who does have fair, pale skin. Something I'll never have. This has unfortunately even leaked into influencing my attraction towards guys who have pale skin. I can still be attracted to other skin colors, but my obvious preference is towards guys who have more of a white skin.

It's really stupid, but the thought that more guys would be attracted to me if I was paler makes me feel really insecure about myself. Even when I do lose the weight, make myself ""prettier"", and accomplish my future life goals I still don't think that I'm as good as I can be unless I have whiter skin. 

It's all really confusing because I don't think of other girls like this. If I see another filipino girl I don't think she should be more pale. It's all really just my opinion of how I should be compared to what I think is perfect appearance-wise. I don't believe I'm horribly ugly, just not good enough. That if there is a guy I'm attracted to and he likes me back then a part of me will feel like he's just settling instead of really appreciating me.

A lot of this sounds like typical low self-esteem issues so I apologize for that.

Change is something I'm not comfortable dealing with, although I've gotten better over the years. At the beginning of last year, I cut off contact with my best friend because I was in love with her and, while she had felt the same at some point, was now dating somebody else. It was too much for me to handle so I decided to move on. I was utterly miserable (as in, getting out of bed was a struggle every day and there was no purpose to my life kind of miserable) until I started getting close to this guy. He started trying to be friends with me after he and his girlfriend broke up, and we got super close really fast. For 5 months, we did everything together. We never dated, although I loved him quite deeply. I never asked him out as initially I was scared of being a rebound, and then later on university life got stressful. I figured I'd do it when the timing was better. I figured I'd have the time. I didn't ever think he would leave. He seemed to care for me as much as I cared for him. We were inseparable. But then one day he just tuned out. Stopped wanting to speak to or spend any time with me. He was never mean, just very very absent. I tried to talk to him about it but he just kept saying ""this is how I am"". In the end, I couldn't take it anymore, so I resolved to get over him like I got over that other girl. I cut him out of my life. 

I haven't spoken to him in 7 months now, and my thoughts are still completely consumed by him. Sometimes I miss him as a person and all the little things about him that made him so amazing, other times I miss that secure, warm feeling of being loved, and other times I miss his love specifically. He loved in the same way I did. When I love, I love completely and with everything I have. I find it really really hard to trust people, but I'm fiercely loyal to those few I do. And I can't get over it with time. Hell, the only reason I got over the girl is because I fell for the guy. And now that I have lost both of them, I've realised I'm not over either of them. I miss them both terribly. And I can't imagine I'll find anyone I love as much. I am really quite lonely. I need to get over both of them and learn to be happy on my own, but I don't know how to do this. I've never been good at moving on, but it's not really been a major issue until now. Because now, well, it's killing me. I've been really depressed for 7 months now. Not any closer to moving on than I was at day 1. Also, the fact that both of them emotionally tuned out just as I was comfortable trusting them completely has given me some baggage and landed me with issues I'd rather not have. I also feel that this is somehow my fault - that I should've been able to act like a rational adult and stay friends with these people and take whatever attention from them I could get while getting over the pain, rather than just cutting them out completely. Makes me feel pathetic. So reddit, if you have any wisdom, please share with me. I've already thrown myself into hobbies and work, and it's not helping. Other suggestions are very welcome.

I've been in a bit of a rut for about a year now and I can't seem to get myself out of it

- It all started when my ex boyfriend broke up with me. I put every ounce of myself into that relationship, he was my first boyfriend and I cared for him so deeply. My actions showed it, and his never did.

- He took advantage of me and would rarely ever recognize how much I cared for him. 

- This fucked me up emotionally. I haven't been able to get back to being the extremely sweet, caring person I used to be

- People still do consider me to be a very sweet girl, I feel as if this is just recently that I've turned into being a cold hearted bitch

- I did attempt to start dating again, but I never clicked with the 3 guys I dated throughout the past year.

- I always wound up in the same situation: they don't like me. I never truly was upset because I never had immense feelings for them either

- I also lost all my of friends due to a falling out between my best friend and my old group of friends. I rarely go out anymore and I currently gave up on dating

Basically, the feelings of loneliness are eating me alive. I have no one to confide in. I am extremely close with my family but they hate to see me upset. I have to put on a facade in front of them and pretend like everything is okay or else my mom will get worried sick about me. I don't want to see her that way, so I pretend like i'm fine to the best of my abilities.

I'm not fine. I cry myself to sleep probably every night. I've never been a jealous person; but now i've began to hate everyone who has what I want. I've become so selfish. I hate how I do good to everyone but I get shit in return. My best friend who cheated on her boyfriend over 10 times still manages to find a nice, caring new boyfriend that treats her with the utmost respect. 

I have nothing to be unhappy about. I have my health, a great family, food &amp; shelter, and the ability to get a great education at an awesome school. 

I feel like i'm never truly happy unless i'm dating someone. My happiness comes from making a significant person in my life happy. I love the feeling of being important to someone. 

I don't know if this is a phase or if I need to seek therapy. I never had luck with friendships and relationships. I tend to date and surround myself around people who are extremely selfish and no good for me. I always am the one who gets burned in the end. I know I need to put a stop to it.

I'm not sure where to post this, so hopefully I made the right choice. Thanks to you all in advance!


I’m not sure if I have an abnormal way of going about relationships, so I would like to ask for some advice.

**Background:**

My early childhood was pretty good, but throughout adolescence I was fighting depression and anxiety (family history is terrible for it). These problems started after I hit 12 and persisted till my diagnosis and treatment at 21. I’m 22 now, so I am just now coming off of medication after getting my life in order and being in remission for quite a while.
  
** **
**Problem:**

I have a hard time fully connecting to the girls that I meet. I met my first girlfriend when I was about 18 and it was a wonderful experience for me. I, however, broke it off after ~7 months as I knew she loved me, but I could not say the same back. I figured that it was not exactly fair for her and I needed to sort some problems out for myself…so I left her.

A year later I met my second girlfriend. We stayed together for 2 years and meeting her was one of the best things that ever happened to me. While going out with her, I gained more confidence, I learned a ton about myself and she helped me through my diagnosis and treatment when things got real bad for me. 

She later left me when she graduated. I changed my major so I had to stay for another few years, and it’s been a dream of mine to move away at to travel when I graduate (my degree will let me do this). She wanted to stay behind and have kids (which I did not want….hell, I was 21!) and I could not promise her that.

Another issue that she brought up when she was breaking up with me was that I never said “I Love You” to her. It made her feel like trash and that I never truly cared about her. I did deeply care about her, but I honestly could not say “I Love You” even after two years. I don’t know if I have commitment issues or something else…but that stuck with me til today.

** **
**Question**  
It’s been a few months since my second girlfriend. I've been going out more and I have slept with a few girls since.  
  
Now, I met this sweetheart of a girl and we have been dating off and on for about a month. I have been really slow-going and apprehensive with her as I REALLY don’t want to enter a relationship right now. I have been up front with her and she has been fine with it so far, though I don't know what she is really thinking. Something in me is still, hurting? I am at a loss for words to describe it.

I don’t know what I want from her, and I don’t really know what I am looking for anymore. It's a really frustrating feeling to have and I am wondering if anybody else has felt this way.  

I'm sorry that I cannot be more articulate on the subject or with my question. I just feel......lost.  
  
Not depressed, just lost.

I have always been a very shy and non-talkative person and I consider myself an introvert.

During my ""childhood""/teenage years I had some serious shyness issues, e.g. I was afraid of talking to people (especially girls) and stuff like that. However, I have been working on myself and (in my opinion) have overcome most of my shyness and fears.

The biggest issue I had was not being able to talk to a person at all. I was really quiet and couldn't hold a conversation for more than about five minutes. From my point of view I have improved a lot, I am now able to even talk to people I just met about random stuff for quite a bit. However, the well-known ""awkward silence"" still happens a lot.

I used to feel very uncomfortable when this happens, so I read a lot about being an introvert etc (especially on reddit). Instead of feeling uncomfortable with myself, I now accept myself a lot more than in the past. Thus, instead of trying to force myself to say something, I can just sit there and be silent without feeling uncomfortable at all.

I don't think I have ever been that comfortable with my personality than I am today. Most of my male friends are introverts too and we all get along very well (there are times when we are out for some beers and nobody has said anything for ten minutes; none of us is bothered by this). 

However, most females seem to be bothered with that. Usually I get away with letting them do most of the talking and women I'm just friends with are ok with it (they never even mentioned that I should talk more).

But as soon as I am interested in more than friendship, the non-talking seems to be a serious problem. I'm constantly turned down by women, because they don't feel like we are suited for each other based on the fact that I'm not constantly talking.

There were three women (during the last two years) who didn't turn me down initially and we got along very well, to a point where we were seeing each other every day. Until after about five to seven days, when each of them abruptly told me they don't want to see me anymore. For me this was a surprise every time, because I thought it was going very well. They all had several reasons, but the one they had in common was that I just wasn't talking enough. I am still friends with all of them, and they keep telling me (really, like every other day!) how quiet I am and that I should talk more.
****
Now I'm not really sure how to think about myself anymore. It's not that I have stopped working on myself, but I'm really happy that I finally managed to accept myself as an introvert.

I'd like to think it's because I have a lot of love to give, and that I'm generally a pretty caring, empathetic person.   But maybe that's overly optimistic and I'm actually just a clingy wanker.

I was always myself, and truly didn't care who liked me or not. 

In grade 10, I went to the Philippines and my parents 'talked' me into being circumcised. I was opposed to the idea because I didn't like change, and I've always decided independently. But they convinced me with arguments such as hygiene even though I didn't much care for that. And they probably pushed it because the Philippines is very cultural and stuff.

Unfortunately, the turn-out wasn't so great. (It's not going to be a tasteful read beyond this point, so be warned.) It was a regular procedure, and no infections or anything. But what ended up happening was an awkward amount of extra skin that'd hang at the bottom of the tip. I figure that what was suppose to be cut off, was left on, probably because the doctor thought it'd still be growing, as i continue to age (lol). 

So now, 3 years later, I remain a virgin. I've disconnected from all my close friends i once had in highschool. Got into smoking weed (a lot) with a close group. Got out of the phase and smoke occasionally because it wasn't a great foundation for building relationships, as well as other things. And now, I pretty much have no friends, maybe 1, hugely intimidated by women, and as much as I want to make close friends, and have an awesome relationship with a companion, I simply can't bring myself to take the steps to do so. 

I always feel the need to revert back to past habits, such as fading myself into the background as I enjoy my time to myself getting high, rather than practicing building up my confidence, learning how to socialize more fluently - as i was so natural at when i was younger - and even having someone as a companion which i feel I'm so ready for. 

I'm listing possible sources to make gradual change in personality, and so far I got: 1) insecurity coming from my botched circumcision. 2) during the large amount of time i set aside for myself, i subsequently introspected my life and got interested in philosophy. 3) if you dont use it, you lose it -- that includes building confidence. 

It can be all of the above, or mainly 1 that I need to honestly address, and figure out what to do. Bottom line, I need to improve myself, and I can make it happen if i work constructively.

See, I can express myself if I have time to think, whence before I could express myself through action. Now, I can't express myself through action, and am always overthinking things... It's like I lost something and I have to trace back my steps to find it.

But when it came down to actually having sex, I felt like I would turn into her, zone out and feel helpless. But without sex, I would be perfectly fine in either a dom or sub scene because I'm a switch.

Then she kept going on like a broken record that I didn't have a future with him or he was just going to hurt me. I tried to ignore her, but I snapped and ended things with him. Things started getting even more weird. She wanted to cut him out completely and started acting crazy and clingy because she knew that he would back off. He did and I tried to repair things, but whenever I spoke to him on the phone, I felt her pushing me to be crazy.

I think about going back to counselling, but I'm afraid of sounding even more crazy than I thought. Does anyone have this crazy impulsive child sitting in their minds?

As of late, I have become this horrible person to my boyfriend of six years. I am moody, clingy (even though he disagrees) and I've been quite conflicted over my feelings about the relationship. We have been having our ups and downs and I guess that's contributing a great deal to what's going on.

To show you the extent of what has happened, let me explain how I was before I was with him. I was going out drinking frequently, had my fair share of bisexual flings, got piercings in quite a few illegal places for my age/country, slept around with a friends with benefits and was happy to live life as a nudist. Yes, I do understand I was younger then and I must accept myself to change with age, but it's more than that.

When getting with my boyfriend he was very uncomfortable with nudity or with my open sexuality, disliked my piercings and my drinking habits. I agreed that it was a bit out of control, so I stopped going out as much, stayed truthful to him (not like I never believed in fidelity), and even removed my piercings. Slowly and eventually he started to challenge my beliefs in nudity, my spirituality and to make me feel bad every time I went out, even if it was for lunch with my sister. After a while I snapped and told him off about it, and he did stop acting that way, however, months later I found him flirting constantly online with other girls he knows. I got angry and confronted him about it, but ever since I have been jealous of him being around other girls. Not to mention that he acts like a dick in public (really flirty, cocky). This has made me start feeling insane about him going out alone because I wonder what he's doing, and honestly, it makes me feel like crap. 

I try to be supportive of him, but inside I feel like I am chewing myself from the inside out. And it makes me irritable. I even got in the habit of calling a bajillion times if he didn't answer my first 5 calls (separated by at least half an hour). It really bothers him and he finds it embarrassing. He sometimes does invite me out with him, but I can't because of other things in my life.

The groups that he joins also bother me in that they seem fanatical. Everyone else we know can see it besides him, and he gets angry at me for suggesting that it is almost cult-like. I asked him to leave and he obviously got upset for me trying to rip him away from the only place he feels he belongs. Ever since he joined them he has changed.

I have become almost mothering to him because of my irritability, I tell him what to do and wear and it's obviously bothering him. I always have some negative opinion on what he does and it bothers him.

I'm really smart, and I overcame a lot to get where I am today (troubled childhood in the third world + emotional, physical, and psychological abuse). Whenever I hang out with people I can't shake that horrible narcissistic feeling that they haven't had it as rough as me. I feel that if they went through a tenth of what I did, they would have broken long ago. What separates me from them is that I survived things they could never even imagine.

There's no way to test or verify my assumption though. At some level I know it doesn't really make any sense. There's no way I can know for sure what someone could or could not live through. I do think, though, this attitude of mine is one of the main reasons I don't connect with people around me. I come from a very different background and a very different context. Most of the people around me come from happy middle-to-upper class homes. They don't really know what it's like ""out there."" Or so I tell myself. 

I have an even harder time connecting with people from the school of hard knocks - mostly because they live in a world I've worked very hard to get away from. I respect them, but I leave them alone. 

At the root of it all I just think I don't connect very well to other people. I've tried bringing them into my world, showing them what I like and sharing what I like to do. I have weird taste in music; lots of world music and I like to draw. I even let people into my vulnerabilities and fears and doubts. 

None of this has helped me overcome the feeling that there's an impenetrable wall between me and other people. That I'll never understand them and they'll never understand me.

I always had this perception in the back of my mind that men didn't want serious relationships. They didn't want to get married. They didn't want girlfriends. 

I see men and women getting into relationships all the time, after just meeting, or after several years they finally confirm what everyone knew all along. I've been in relationships too including my last one--that went on for about five years....that was more or less out of convenience for my ex...it never was going to go anywhere. I guess I thought at some point I'd grow on him and he'd change his mind? I don't know what I was thinking.

It's only recently occurred to me after being single for some time, that there are men that do want relationships, marriages, families, those sort of things and maybe I've been looking at everything all wrong and men aren't all that stereotypical DB a girl has to lasso and hogtie to keep around. To be honest, I've always been quite lax in my relationships so I felt that this was the reason I hadn't settled down.

However, it seems with this new knowledge came the dreaded realization that it's not them. My attempts at seeing people since then have ended up disastrous. I find myself being fed that they don't want a relationship right now over and over again. 

One man who I've known for many years, but never known all that well enough for us to know any details about each other, confessed the same to me while trying to hook up. I shot him down, and a few weeks later, he changed the facebook status--yep--he was seeing someone. They broke up a few months later, and when he spoke to me again in a tone I felt familiar to prior, I felt comfortable confronting him by telling him that his actions hurt me and why. He was very nice and told me he just thought I was that kind of girl. I told him I wasn't and he promised he wouldn't try anything again. And that itself stung too.

I tried a more traditional girl route with my next date, as I would call it. At first he was just a friend. He and I talked for several months online--it was a friend of a friend and for some reason or another it just made sense. We talked a little about our past relationships and he was very sympathetic about what I had revealed about my previous long term relationship--stating that he felt bad and he didn't understand how anyone could not want to be with me. We started seeing each other and after a month of what was going along great, things were starting to get physical, and we were clicking well, he stopped speaking to me. When I finally decided there was a problem and he wasn't just busy, I asked him about it, he told me that he just didn't want a relationship right now and he felt I might be pushing one.

Go figure.

I am currently a 20 year old, male, college student. I suffered from moderate to severe depression in the recent past and there is still a threat that I could retreat back into a depressive state. I'm currently in therapy and I think it has truly put me a step forward to positive change in my life.

I blame my mother for the depression. She frequently yelled at me for seemingly insignificant things. Things like: forgetting to do a chore, not reminding her about someone who called, and not talking to her. At a young age I really couldn't help but submit to this verbal abuse; it showed negatively in my high school years. 

I was near socially inept. Talking to people gave me that fear of ""messing up"" and lead me to feel like this ""messing up"" would yield yelling...just as my mother had done throughout my childhood. I quickly had begun to feel very isolated, alone, and of course depressed. 

My teen-aged self sought to relieve these feelings by finding a significant other. Of course having a girl in my life was great for a while. A long while actually, two years to be semi-exact. I thought it helped but I was only in lust. I ended up breaking up with this girl only to have another year long rebound relationship. I started with the same hopes in mind as the first, only to be let down again.

It wasn't their fault that they didn't ""cure"" my depression. I was simply not realizing that I actually had a serious issue on my hands. Depression wasn't to be cured by a girlfriend, I needed serious help. I got that serious help last fall. Therapy is doing me very well as I just generally feel less and less depressed as the weeks go by. The social anxiety though, still lingers.

I've developed this terribly illogical fear that nobody likes me or wants to talk to me. Yes, people do and yes I have made a few new friends during my first two college years. But they've always been the ones to initiate this. This fear shows especially when I'm around a girl i possibly like.

My problem is that I immediately assume that I have to somehow prove myself to everyone I meet. I assume that I am somehow deficient of ""something"" and not really worthy to be friends/SO's with them/her/whoever. 

So, yes I have friends and sure I can socialize. But this fear has me believing that nobody really wants to be friends with me. As a result I don't even bother because I have that preconceived notion that I'm just not ""good enough"". Am I alone here? Anybody else feeling the same thing?

**tl;dr I can't talk to new people without the fear that they won't like me. It has led to me not even wanting to try and socialize. **

Then I panicked.  I started thinking about the expectations that were being set up because we seemed to be connecting so quickly over the phone.  I started wondering if I really want to  open myself up to that kind of vulnerability again.  I ended up talking myself into breaking things off.  

He was pretty hurt.  I wasn't mean about it or anything, I just told him that I really like him, but that I was feeling like getting into a relationship at this time is a bad idea.  He told me I've had my shot, and not to think that he'll ever give me another.

1328126081.0,8,self.ihaveissues,p6jru,How do I get past my insecurities?,stevyjohny,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/p6jru/how_do_i_get_past_my_insecurities/," I would like some advice on something I have been dealing with . I am 22 and used to be an above average acne sufferer. Thankfully, most of the acne is gone as in I do not get it anywhere close like i used to. I used to get it really bad on both my back and face. Fortunately, the deep cysts on my face never left any severe scarring. I have a few minor tear type scars on my chin. Ironically, I actually like the look of them. I doubt most people notice, but they kinda look like the harrison ford scar so in a weird way i like it. Unfortunately, my back suffered enumerably and are not cool scars. 

I went on accutane and it helped a lot overall with my face and back, but it was too late as my back had just too many. Up to that point, it had been a few years since it started. I started to get acne around 17. Did not get on accutane until 4-5 months before my 20th birthday. The reason why it took to long to get on accutane was because my mom and new doctor (both female no offense) were relucant. ANd then my mom quit her job which had inusrance for like a year in between so I could not get treatment. OUt of pocket accutane is like 500 a month. The most frustrating part is that my original doctor recommended it, but my mom shot it down becuase she ""heard"" bad things. She works in a pharmacy and remembers the bad experiences. However, only a small percentage of people ever suffer the negative side affects. Neverthelss, I got extremely unlucky missing out the first time and then again with the new (female) doctor. Yes, I went to two doctors and missed out. After my mom shot down accutane the first time, I got useless antibiotics. Then, after switching doctors, the new doctors prescribed more useless antibiotics. And then again with not having insurance for awhile. Finally, got on it when my dad got a new job (insurance). Went and saw a new doctor (female, you see im not sexist) who instantly prescribed me accutane.

However, like I was saying. The scars were left and they are bad. I have tried for the past 6 months to heal them using steroid injections at the derm. I have noticed a difference. They are less pink now and lowered, but still very much there. They look better to me, but the average person would think that I had got no treatment at all, if that gives you an idea.

My problem is this. I really feel like this is holding me back. I have given it a good shot to heal them best I can. The last option is some hideously expensive laser surgery which I doubt it will be able to fix what I have. For the most part, I have accepted my fate. I don't really go through life thinking about how bad it sucks to have these scars, but it does pop in my mind occasionally. However, it I believe it has kept me back because the fear of people seeing has kept from doing things that I had always done. I do not like swimming or anything where I have to take my shirt off. 

They may fade with time, who knows. But i need to be comfortable in my own skin. I also feels this holds me back with the ladies as I am afraid what they would say. Otherwise, i think most people say that I am a fairly decent looking guy. I have a profile on a dating site. I have had a few compliments from my pictures. I don't consider my looks anything special or handsome. I don't consider myself to be that way. I do not think I am ugly, but its just something I don't really think about. In other words, I am generally ok with my looks. In fact, I like my face and have become accustomed to my somewhat largish roman nose. I used to hate it, but I see it as unique now. I understand some girls might find me attractive (some won't) and I like it, but I never had smoke blown up my you know what during my childhood like most kids. So maybe this is why I think this way about myself. I dont hate myself. I have had a few compliments from older and younger woman, but I generally just shrug them off. 

But I am really self conscious about the scars because they are so noticeable. Is there any advice for me? Should I just rip my shirt off and pretend nothing is wrong and ignore my feelings? Do i tell just tell them before? I have learned a lot though through having this problem. I realized how shallow I can be with looks (other girls) and how potentially unnattractive I am. It feels like I a catch 22, if get a compliment from a girl or something. Its like, I wonder what they would think if they really knew what I looked like.....I have no doubt that some would be turned off by it. Should I just go with the flow and ignore any potentially mean comments? Is this a potential deal breaker?

May as well give some back story; I recently got a job after being a recluse for over 8 years, I'm a 26 year old male and still live with my Dad. I've struggled with my sexuality over the years, and am still not sure. I guess I'm a pretty good looking guy now, which is hard to acknowledge since I've hated myself for so many years.

I guess I'm worried that I'm only pursuing women because I think that's what I should be doing, and what everyone is trying to get me to do. To be normal. To not be asexual or gay. I think I'm scared to invest that much trust in people as well. Maybe I'm just afraid of the change.

I've been accused of being smart, pretty, responsible, goingsomewhereinlife and all that... but I don't see any of it. 

I think I am weak and naive, and this caused my sexual assault. I think if I had pushed him away/yelled/whatever as soon as I woke up (from being passed out drunk) and realized someone else was in bed with me. But I was so tired and so confused and at the time I thought I was at home, I thought the person next to me must have been a person I knew. Must have been, because, there is just no other plausible situation for why I wouldn't know there is a guy in bed with me. 

But, no excuses, doesn't matter because when I realized that I went to bed alone I still said nothing. And when he touched me, I said nothing. When his hand slid up my shirt/down my pants? NOTHING. I TOLD MYSELF HE WOULD STOP. The farther the went, the more I told myself he would just stop, just go back to sleep and pretend this is not happening. What even is that? That's crazy, I was being crazy and illogical. 

It took him trying to stick his finger inside me for I said anything. And, ofc, when I did this obviously didn't matter. Kept going, and I just sat there and softly repeated ""stop, don't, go away, please just go away.."" I pushed away, but not hard enough. Eventually, though, he did stop and he didn't go through with like raping me or anything.. still feelsbadman. 

Feels worse, sometimes, I think, because it makes it so confusing. It wasn't rape so why am I so fucked up? Why am I tearing myself apart to put myself back together? 

There are so many more details that go into this. This happened in June, so it's been awhile now and I should really be over it. These last few months, though, have been this blur of numbness and drug use and inappropriate sex. This all can't be because of this, right? There's no way that something so minimal could make somebody so.. crazy. I'm crazy now. 

Yes, I've tried therapy. Yes, I have ""people I could talk to."" But not really, because they don't get it. I don't even get it. And, truthfully, I'm ashamed it happened. I do blame me, I think more than I blame him, and this shame is just becoming more deeply rooted into the person I feel I am.

Also, I'm not really sure this is the best subreddit for this, but I can't really find anywhere better.

I'll start off with a little about me, and then just generally talk about my issues.  I'm a 17 year old girl (Highschooler in the United States). I am also a lesbian.  I've always been introverted, and had very few friends.

But, recently, I've gotten a girlfriend :D (And damn is it difficult, considering most girls don't swing that way).

My girlfriend is beautiful, imho.  She has beautiful, flowing, long hair; also, her eyes are simply amazing.  The main defining physical feature about her, though is that she's albino.  Her hair is completely white, and her eyes are an interesting shade of red (Very pretty, though).  Personality wise, she's also wonderful.  She's kind, and very understanding; A good friend.

There is but one problem with all of this, though.  She isn't real.  What I mean by that is that she only exists in my mind (I visually hallucinate her or anything).  I know very well that she's only a part of my mind, but I can't help loving her.  I don't think I'm narcissistic or anything (I don't exactly love myself in this situation, even though she is in my mind).  She's always there for me, and so happy to be around me (Well, part of me, technically).

I don't know anything about why this may be happening with me, and I really want to know if something is wrong with me, even though my 'girlfriend' seems to be making me a happier person.  If the information helps at all, my LGBT status is pretty much openly known, and people around me aren't very accepting of it.  My friends don't mind at all, but the rest of the world around me is extremely judgemental, and prone to make me feel really terrible about my life (About life in general. NOT about being LGBT.), which wears down havily on me.  I'm very afraid that I'll end up leaving school with some kind of mental trauma.

Can anyone help me better understand my 'condition' (I guess you could call it that?), and maybe give me any advice you can offer?

I tried to get her back and we went on a few dates, but she ended up turning me down for another guy. It has been 3+ years since all this happened, however over the past year or so, strange things have happened and I have learned some information.

1. She sent me a text randomly asking about food, but since I did not have her phone number, I didn't know it was her. I responded saying she had the wrong number, and asking who it was. We went back and forth, and I guessed that she was a different ex of mine. She got mad that I didn't recognize her number. 

2. When I was trying to get her back, she had already been seeing the guy she eventually said no to me for. They are married now, and he will be at the wedding as well. 

3. While I was in a different, terrible relationship we had gotten together to catch up. We talked for a good while, I complained about the current girlfriend, etc. Long story short; she invited me to her place so we could have sex. I obliged. 

4. While we were dating I was going through a very difficult time in my life and I became extremely depressed. After we had broken up I found out she was saying how crazy I had become to one of her friends.

5. I found out she had been talking to my best friend, and among the topics was how I had lied to her about being in a relationship and coaxed her to sleeping with me (see #3), that my family is very fucked up, that our relationship was an utter disaster and it was my fault, that her current husband is nervous about meeting me at the wedding, etc.

6. I am starting to get the feeling that my friends feel I am still not over her, and that when I see her at the wedding I will do something foolish or crazy. I assume this is because of the things she has said since I haven't brought her up to them for more than a year.

After we had broken up, I was sad for a long while, but I got over it and moved on as most do. I had no ill will for her, in fact I held her very highly. But as these things kept happening, my opinion of her went south quickly. I now feel a great deal of resentment and anger towards her. Not because of anything to do with our romantic relationship, but because of the way she has acted and the things she has done since then.

What I am asking is, what do I do when I see her? I mean, I know that the right and mature thing to do is to acknowledge her and keep it civil. What is the point in bringing up any of this stuff and starting a fight with someone I haven't talked to in years? But at the same time, this crap is very inappropriate and I can't sit back and let her say these things about me to my friends.

I've been in love twice. When I was 18, I fell in love with a girl I met through an online forum. We were friends for a few years before I fell in love with her. She was in love with me also. She told me that she loved me and I said I loved her too, but wasn't sure if we should start a relationship since we lived on opposite sides of the world. We then planned that I could move to her country at the end of the year and we could start up a relationship. During this time, she met somebody else, hid her relationship with this other girl from me for a few months, and strung me along for a few more, before I ended things.

The second time was with a boy I met mid-2011. It took us a while to get past the acquaintances stage, but once we did, we became really close really quickly. He told me I was all he wanted in a partner and that he'd never met somebody he got along with this well. I thought, given how close we were, he was preparing to ask me out. I would have asked him out except that he told me right from the beginning (when we were still getting to know each other) that he found those kind of situations uncomfortable and didn't like being put on the spot. He said that he liked making the first move. I was sure he was just testing to see if I were up for taking this one step further. After 5 months, he suddenly became very cold and distant. He gave me vague answers when I asked why, and stopped initiating contact with me. I was sick of chasing him and asking 'why' and thought I was sounding clingy, so I stopped talking and waited for him to come to me. We haven't spoken in two and a half months.

This is a pathetic problem, and I feel pathetic asking it, but I would like to know - is there anything wrong with me? Have I handled these situations badly?

I'm just going to give you the cut throat short story of my dilemma. 

Basically I have fallen in love with my step mums neice, she's every girl I dream of yet I cant seem to gather whether she knows how I feel about her or not. 

I mean when I'm at the beach house with her she always jokes around with me and she shares stuff with me that nobody else knows but deep down I really have fallen for her.. 

I'm 19 and she's 21, I can't stop thinking about her and I'm sick of her getting hurt by these douche bag boyfriends.. I really just want to grab her and say I'm here and I'll never let you go.. (queue love music) 

Is their anyway I can hint that I actually have deeper feelings for her rather then her thinking of me as a friend? 

I'm actually semi-depressed that I can't be with her because she makes me happy, she has a smile that shines and makes me feel good no matter how shit a week I've had. Yet the desire to be with her is killing me emotionally.. 

TBH I see her as my soul mate, whether she feels the same way is another question, girls are so dam complicated and I can get the wrong impression/signs very easily.. 

I mean about a year ago she was telling me her secrets and flirting with me and even sent me a shot of her in lingerie asking if I thought she looked good. 

WTF do I do, I feel heart broken and fucking stupid as the same time.

What do I do?",Lindlaar,7,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/nuk3e/at_some_point_along_the_road_i_got_pretty/,"These are some things that I've never told anyone.  I'd like to know how screwed up I am and what I can do about it.

Me as a young boy:  Living in a pretty standard neighborhood, a fair number of boys my own age to make friends with.  I remember that at first I was pretty normal.  I got along with the other boys, could call them friends, would go out and play sports, bike, etc.  Normal.

At some point, I developed a 'best friend' relationship with a boy named Randy.  Randy was a few years older than me, I looked up to him, and we got along dandy.  At some point, and I'm not sure how it began, we started 'experimenting' with one another.  Showing each other what we had, touching (nothing 'sexual', as we didn't know enough about what to do), maybe getting a little under dressed and wrestling.  We definitely knew it was 'not right' according to what our parents would think, but we seemed to enjoy it, would get horny, etc.  

Eventually, Randy stopped coming over to my house.  I think he began to feel that what we were doing was wrong personally, but I didn't.  When he did come over, I would still pursue these actions, and he would be uninterested.  Our relationship trailed off, we stopped talking.

After that happened, I repeated the same thing with another boy.  We started to become friends, would visit each others houses, eventually began 'experimenting'.  Eventually the other boy became uninterested, stopped responding to my continued interest.  A repeat of the first case.

The same thing happened with another boy.  This time, however, my parents caught onto it.  They contacted the boy's parents and told them, my father took me aside and had a 'birds and the bees' talk, chalking up my actions with another boy to be 'curiosity'.

After this, I found that I was no longer 'normal' according to the other children.  It seemed that I was shunned.  The other boys who I had been experimenting with made it clear to the rest of the children that I was not normal, and I found that I had few friends left in the neighborhood. 

End neighborhood relationships, begin school relationships.

Beginning elementary school, I was pretty normal.  I made friends easily, was accepted, all that good stuff.  
Around grade 3 I developed a 'best friend' relationship with another boy.  This boy was popular, good looking, athletic basketball player. We would visit each others houses, do lots of things together, etc.  At one point we had a sleepover.  During this, I made advances similar to what I did at a slightly younger age.  The boy was uninterested, was disgusted, and we stopped being friends.  For whatever reason, after this, I stopped making friends easily.  Whether it was because the popular boy shared stories about me, or because my personality changed.  I became quiet, shy, introverted, had no friends.

The sort of personality stayed with my throughout the rest of grade school.  I was withdrawn and quiet, and really just had no interest in even trying to make friends with others.

Flash forward to today.  I am a 23 y/o male, recently graduated from college, pursuing medicine, very interested in science.  I have not been in a relationship or had sex in 2+ years (and that was with a girl).  One of my few friends is a 19 y/o male. 

I have been attracted to this 19 y/o male for several years (while we were attending the same university).  After I graduated, I stopped thinking about him, but I recently went on a ski trip with him, and I found that my feelings for him are just as strong, if not stronger.

It is not just a sexual interest.  He is smart and funny.  I enjoy being around him, converse easily, find the same things funny, have the same thoughts as he has them (at which point we look at each other and crack up, while no one else seems to get the joke).  I also find him sexually attractive.  Slim athletic build, pretty facial features.  You get the idea.  

Despite my truly powerful desire to confess my feelings and hope so hard that he is either interested or not so disgusted that he shuns me henceforth, I can't help but notice the pattern my relationships have followed before.

Alone-&gt; Found a friend-&gt;Became attracted to him-&gt;Showed sign of feelings-&gt;Friend does not share feelings, rebukes me, and makes distance-&gt;Alone

You see, I wonder if I am truly gay.  I wonder if my feelings for him are not some artifact of developing an abnormal sense of friendship that must progress to being sexual.
I wonder if this is not some self-destructive habit destined to leave me alone and miserable. 
I wonder if I am not just very horny because I have not had sex in so long. 
I'd like answers.  I'd settle for opinions.

Oh btw, did I mention that I watch pedophilia?  Yep.  I'd never do anything to harm a child, but I am sexually attracted to images of underage girls and boys.

I've dated a few people and have known a lot more and never have I felt this way with anyone. except theres this one guy that it feels like all he has to do is look me in the eye and I'm safe, I guess you'd say. It feels so magnetic, and its far beyond the infatuation/sex appeal phase because that's not all I think about, and I've felt this way the entire time I've known him. Every conversation is stimulating and so outstanding and all I can think about is wanting to spend every second just talking to him and being with him. Neither of us have made a move yet and thats not really my question, but I have no doubts in my mind that it would be an incredible/passionate relationship if it ever became one.

But do you think everyone is capable of finding passionate, crazy, outstanding, electrifying, gravity-defying love? I know it's hard to come by, but it's not impossible. I know it takes time but is it really that crazy to want that, and does it last? I don't see the point in settling for anything less than that, does anyone else agree?

Like every girl, I have had years of thinking of my perfect proposal. This might not be what you would want but for me and in my head it went a little something like this. (insert fuzzy edged dream sequence) It would be around Christmas since it's my favorite time of year (all the lights and shiny things make me happy) and we would be on a vacation at the happiest place on earth, you know Disney World. We would have a wonderful time going on all the rides and seeing all the sites. I would get to meet Mickey and Minnie and walk through Cinderella's Castle. Maybe get to meet some princesses too. (If you haven't noticed I'm a pretty big Disney fan; I know it's lame but I don't care...I freakin' love Disney!) Then we would go to the fireworks in the Magic Kingdom at night and right before the finale he would get down on one knee and hold out a ring for me. Then when I say yes the mother load of all fireworks begins behind us.

I know tons of you will be laughing at this and saying ""like that will ever happen"" but that was somehow what has always been in my head as the perfect proposal.

So here's the problem I am super jealous of my bf's brother and gf (well, fiance as of yesterday) and I don't want to be. So my bf and his family went down to Orlando this holiday season for a little vacation. They are hitting up some of the major attractions (Disney, Universal, Sea World, etc.). They invited me to go with them but I declined because I knew my dad was really looking forward to me being home and he's had such a crappy year and it would probably crush him if I decided to not spend the time with him. So yesterday, they all went to the Magic Kingdom at Disney and guess what?!?! My bf's brother proposed to his gf in the exact way as my perfect proposal. And as if that wasn't enough, the ring he got her is the same setting as my favorite.

So now here I am when all I should be is happy for them I'm thinking about myself and how I can never have my perfect proposal. And it makes me feel like such a horrible person. How do I get past this so that I will be happy with whatever proposal I get and so that I can just be happy for my bf's brother? 

**TL/DR**: My bf's brother just proposed to his gf in the exact way that I have always dreamed of with my favorite ring and I'm super jealous. How do I stop being such a selfish bitch?

**Background Info**: Bf and I have been dating for a little over 6 years now. Bf knows all of these things that I like so it would actually be possible for him to think of this proposal on his own. He also knows how much I have thought about what the perfect proposal would be for me and he knew that I had some high expectations (thankfully that didn't scare him away).

I've tried looking through meetup.com for ideas but there is nothing interesting after I filter out business network, religious meet ups or groups that exclude single white straight men.

My friends (before they moved away) used to joke that I'm like a piece of furniture because I'm so quiet. They would honestly forget that I'm present.  

I tried therapy for several months and that helped with my feeling of worthlessness but we got stuck on what to do next (where to go, what to do). My therapist moved away a few months ago and I've made no progress since. The last 2 months of therapy were pointless anyways because I was stuck trying to find a social activities to pursue. 

Has anyone here overcome a similar situation? What can I do to make friends, enjoy life and then later maybe start dating.

It's been two years since my last relationship, and I've never been in a mutually happy, satisfying one. That's a whole 'nother story. The only sex I've had since then is with one guy. We briefly had a casual relationship (no commitment, but dates, cuddling, pillow talk, that kind of stuff) then he stopped calling me. Months later, we reconciled for a few weeks until he moved out of state. I see him a few times year, where we spend a wonderful, intimate weekend together and then he leaves, not to heard from again until 6 months later or whatever. 

While we have a lot of fun and the chemistry is insane, even if circumstances made it possible, he has a lot personal issues that would make him a terrible boyfriend. As an FWB though, he's perfect. I like where we are. The problem is, I'm so lonely and sexually frustrated, that I sort of project all of these feelings onto him. I think about him all the time. When the possibility of seeing him comes up, I get way too excited (and often disappointed, when it doesn't end up happening). It's not him I'm obsessed with per say, but the idea of intimacy that he represents. He's the only guy that I've ever really felt comfortable and enjoyed sex with, so he's the only guy I can picture in my fantasies, etc. I've built up this idea of him in my head that isn't what he really is. This probably has a lot to do with my anxiety disorder. I obsess and over analyze every little thing in my life. 

My friends think I'm torturing myself and I should cut him off. It's the obvious answer- when one person feels more strongly than the other in a FWB situation, that's what you're supposed to do. But its complicated because I know its all an illusion- when I'm being logical, I know how things are I have very healthy feelings towards him, but they just get extremely cloudy and distorted when I feel lonely and want a man around (which is more often than not). The hardest part is that nothing will change if I stop seeing him, I'll still think about him all the time, I'll just be kicking myself for not sleeping with him when I had the chance. And of course, let's be honest, when you haven't had sex in 4 months and there's no other prospects on the horizon, its pretty damn hard to turn it down. He's coming back into town soon for the holidays and while I want to see him, I feel conflicted. I'm so lost in my own head, I have no idea what to do.

I feel that I put in more effort on some things than others do. I'm tired of worrying about people and making sure things are alright when the favor can't be returned. 

In my wildest fantasy, I live in a cabin in the woods somewhere where everything is self-sustained. No one messes with me. I don't mess with them. I don't have the burden of trying to help others who are more than capable of helping themselves. I look out for myself and don't have to worry about anything else. 

I feel the urge to just up and go sometimes. I have friends and family in other states. I have one wonderful friend who is very supportive on days when I feel squirrelly. She hasn't lied to me. She doesn't sugar coat anything. She's even offered to let me come and stay for a few days. If it were up to her I would come to Cali and be her roommate tomorrow. 

I keep my distance from her. She reminds me too much of someone from the past. Someone who burnt me bad when I needed her the most, but this friend isn't that girl. She knows the best and worst about me, but she's still happy to hear from me every day. She's been like a sister and I've never even met her.

I'm 25 and I'm just tired of bullshit. No, I'm not suicidal. I'm not going to go postal or anything. I'm just worn out. 

How does one get a new outlook on life when they feel like this? How do you stop seeing the monsters in people and learn to look for the good?

So I'm gonna start this with the following statement: I'm a sleepwalker. My parents noticed it when I was young, and it sort of carried through adolescence into teens, and in high-school it was fairly manageable. Then came college, and my sleep schedule got totally thrown out of whack and I start to really sleep walk again, which has sort of ruled out late-night excursions and follow-up walk of shames for fear that I injure myself or somebody else (I've actually attempted to go to parties while asleep).

As part 2 of the background, I fairly recently got dumped by my ex (about 2-3 months ago, I actually posted about this fairly recently), but now I'm pretty well over her and I've gotten serious with the girl that was one of the ""rebounders,"" but I made a mistake. After some fun one night I fell asleep with her at her room, and apparently she had sex with me while I was asleep (which because I'm a sleep walker is apparently very possible... it's called sexsomnia).

Normally I'd be fine with this sort of thing, I'm fairly open minded when it comes to kinky so I let her have her fun (hoping I didn't do something bad while asleep), but it's gotten out of hand. She pretty much ONLY wants to have sex with me while I'm asleep. I can't really recall the specifics about an event when it happens, and I've tried talking to her about it but she's very evasive. I care about this girl a lot, and I really don't want to break it just because she likes things to be kinky (and is kind of leaving me out... it actually feels remarkably like she's cheating on me, she refers to me being asleep as ""dream-you"").

So what should I do? I can't seem to talk to her, but I don't want to call it off for (what I consider to be) a weak reason.

**tl;dr** I'm a sleepwalker. My new gf LOVES having sex with asleep-me (""dream-you"" she calls him/me), but she doesn't really want to have sex with me while I'm awake. I've tried talking about it, she doesn't really want to, and I don't want to break it off for a silly reason.",,False,,t5_2s90u,True,,,True,t3_n0viv,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/n0viv/22m_so_guysgals_i_got_a_weird_one_for_you/,

(20/f),ludo180,8,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/mtf2z/how_important_is_sex_in_a_relationship_20f/,"We first dated when 14 which we don't really count being so young, we broke up did our own thing dated other people. Started being friends with benefits (not exclusive) when 16 for a year and a bit (went at it like rabbits like any young teens).. started dating exclusively when 18.. we played the field for a while and realized how awesome being with your best friend was. Here we are 3 years on, every other aspect of our relationship is perfect. About two years ago the sex slowed down.. around the time he got his current job, its pretty stressful and has resulted in him gaining a bit of weight. It was 4-5 times a week.. to 2-3.. to once... to once a month.. now we've only had sex once this year. We've spoken about it and he says its because he is tired after work and with his current fitness  he gets too tired during. He says he will get fit again and try and do it more but he just wont. I even learned to cook so he had healthier options but then he would secretly eat junk food. Its been 6 months since our last 'talk' and nothing has changed. Its gotten to the point where i cant sleep and cant lay next to him when he's sleeping because i just get pissed off with him for sleeping. I have a stressful job as well ( we have the same job but at different companies) and understand where he is coming from and support him where i can. But the lack of sex is just .. well sexually frustrating. When fantasizing, its generally about him and I'm not really attracted to others aside from the normal crush you get here and there. I have never considered finding sex elsewhere. What if it turns out he just has a low sex drive now? When every other aspect of your relationship is perfect? Hes a great guy, we have the same interests, get along really well. I should mention he is still affectionate with hugging and kissing and stuff which is great. 

Anyone else been in this situation?

**Female, 37. I’ve always considered myself to be a kind, caring, giving, loving, optimistic and compassionate person with a lot to give. I'm strong, determined, confident and independent (most of the time :-p). I'm curious, intelligent, love to learn new things and can be somewhat adventurous. I’m very passionate about many aspects of life, can be funny (apparently), fun to be with, a little quirky at times, and a little cheeky.** 




I welcome a challenge and I’m willing to push my own boundaries to overcome fears and achieve things that perhaps once seemed overwhelming to me. I consider myself to be open-minded, though since the side-effects of an illness a few years ago (below) it sometimes takes time for new perspectives to make sense to me, to gain clarity and understand. I'm creative and artistic; I published a positive media magazine a few years ago (hoping to re-launch soon), I sketch nudes and I write. I like to help others whenever possible, to organise/promote/run community and fundraising events, volunteer where I can, take in stray/wild animals that need help, and I foster babies in need of love. I have two teen boys of my own (14 &amp; 19) and at the moment I’m fostering a beautiful 6 month old baby boy (born 7 weeks premature, drug addicted). I have a wonderful group of friends and I’m always there for any of them if they need anything, as they are for me.




**I grew up with an emotionally and physically abusive brother, a clinically depressed mother, and a father that was always working away. At 14 I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and was in and out of hospital frequently. I had my first child when I was 17, second when I was 23 in a marriage that fell apart 2 years later, after post natal depression. As a single mum I found my strength again, found new passions and perspectives, and homeschooled my boys for a few years; my youngest had speech and learning challenges (he is now 14 and flying aeroplanes in a high school Aviation program and at Air Force Cadets). At 29 my kidneys began to fail. I went on dialysis and at 32 with only weeks left I received a double transplant (kidney &amp; pancreas). So I’ve dealt with a few things in my life thus far, all of which I believe have made me a stronger woman.**




February 2010 I fell in love with a wonderful man (both 35 at that time). What we felt for each other neither of us had felt for anyone else before. We made a commitment to each other, made promises, made future plans to grow old together. The passion, the chemistry, the depths we went to together, the love – it was extraordinary.




**But it wasn’t so simple; I lost his baby (miscarriage) early in our relationship (we didn’t even know we were pregnant), we moved in together (normal adjustments, plus our kids), after a botched birth control implement I bled for almost 3 months straight, in regular pain, taking hormone treatments on top of my transplant meds (steroids etc), became severely anaemic, had blood transfusions that threatened my transplant, all ending in a hysterectomy. My ex wanted more children; I felt like I had failed him in a HUGE way. I already felt insecure about my transplant going into the relationship; could anyone love me, accept me and commit to a future with me when my life holds so much uncertainty (my transplant could fail anytime), but now there were added insecurities and failures to deal with. He assured me he loved me, he would never stop loving me, and he would always be there for me, no matter what. So I threw caution to the wind, and trusted him.**




Through all the health concerns and stresses I was not able to do the things I was passionate about in life, the things that make me who I am, the things about me that my ex fell in love with. Although I managed to still find the energy to do special things for him, to acknowledge him, to give to our relationship, I lost myself...completely it now appears. I became insecure, somewhat needy, and quite sensitive/emotional (crying lots). Neither my ex nor I knew how to deal with this. Other things happened in that time that I feel exacerbated my fears and my ex admitted to not being the reassuring type. Things spiralled out of control from there. A year after we met he ended our relationship.




**We kept seeing each other casually until around 5 weeks ago. Although I’ve been getting some professional help for my insecurities etc for some time now, I’ve worked hard on myself, and learnt a lot about him and our relationship, the ‘casual’ aspect drove me a tad crazy in the end. We did everything a couple would do, minus the commitment on his behalf.** 




Although I fully accept my ex for who he is, and I still love him unconditionally, there were personality traits that challenged me on different levels; his love of porn, his fascination with sex/other people’s sex life, his need for 2-3 hours alone time a day (quite introvert), the type of interactions he has with other women (seems to need a certain amount of attention from other women), his defensive behaviours. Not one to stray away from a challenge, and REALLY wanting to understand him so completely, I tried to learn all I could about him, about these parts of his personality (read books, blogs, article, went on forums etc), and face my deeper fears that they triggered so that such things would not affect our relationship long term. Happily I came to understand, appreciate and even enjoy all these quirks about him and his personality needs. 




**During our ‘casual’ time he was on a dating site that progressed to him flirting with and pursuing dates with other women. Due partly to the lack of commitment between us now, and despite being very open sexually, willing to try anything once, not shy in expressing myself, keen to please...I regrettably began to feel sexually inadequate as time went on.**




We would often fantasise about threesomes together. On April Fool’s Day (still in casual time) I told him I had slept with two women the night before. He became very aroused so I kept the story going for the morning. We laughed about it after and he told me to feel free to spin such stories in future, pretending they were real, as it was incredibly hot. He told me I needn’t tell him if they were a story or not, to leave him guessing as that was even more of a turn on.




**A few weeks later, in a feeling-sexually-inadequate moment again, I started another story about having a lesbian sex experience. He got SO turned on!! We both did. The next time we were together, he couldn’t get enough of me. He was all over me, SO attentive sexually – I LOVED it. It was what I had been craving from him. Suddenly I became more interesting to him sexually again. He was curious about ME again, and so passionate. I kept the story going for a few months as it felt so amazing to have his sexual attention the way he was giving it to me. Then he started feeling uncomfortable with it; we had spoken about him joining in, but of course he couldn’t, it was a ‘story’...though it had even begun to feel real to me. I eased off and wanted to tell him that none of it was real, but it had bought us so close; he was telling me he loved me again, we were spending so much more time together, we were opening about our sexual fantasies and desires in so much more depth, we were connecting on all other levels more also. Then, the dating site...the closer we became I took my profile offline. I told him this and he agreed it was a good idea for me to do so. I wrongly thought he may have taken his offline too, but when doing some work on his laptop one night I went to the internet history to find a site I had been working off 20 mins before. I found his OKC account was still active. I felt uncomfortable. He explained that he was on there just casually chatting with women most nights. I asked why it was set to single not ‘seeing someone’. He didn’t consider we were even ‘seeing each other’ ,just FWB. I was hurt and felt confused.** 




That night I went home and created an account on OKC pretending to be someone else to see what his profile/activity was. I contacted him (I know, silly), ended up pretending to be my fake lesbian lover and took my hurt out on him through that guise. It was awful. I’m not a nasty person, I rarely ever get angry or express my anger if I am, but I got nasty with him through this fake profile. Over the following days, he knew something was wrong. He knew I wasn’t being honest. I was a wreck by this time, so far beneath the woman I knew myself to be. I confessed it ALL to him in the end. 




**Four days after the confession he again professed his love for me, said he didn’t understand how something so beautiful and deep (the connection and love between us) could feel so bad sometimes, but that if we stayed in that space of love and acceptance we’d be fine. He said he knew he made it hard for me to accept him and his behaviour sometimes, but by the fact that I did he knew he wanted to be with me. I told him I couldn’t do casual with him anymore as it was driving me crazy. He said he didn’t want to; he wanted to be in a committed relationship with me again. That changed a week later after a misunderstanding and me reminding him I couldn't do casual, regrettably via an ultimatum. We were on-again-off-again like this for some time.**




One of the attributes I didn’t include in my description above of who I am as a person was honest. My ex once said I was the most honest and open person he had ever met. My friends know me to be that person. I prided myself on being that person. But now, I had lied, I had spun a huge story that ended in a mess. In another ‘off’ stage of ours I once again stretched the truth about two sexual acts to keep his sexual attention (at this stage he was having dates with a girl off OKC). And most recently I initially denied having two throwaway accounts on Reddit; one which I posted about how I was feeling sexually now, which I didn’t feel he needed to know. The other I used to comment on one of his comments to a post, pretending to be someone else in the hope he would understand my feelings and perspective on a situation.  




**I’ve messed up! I’ve become a dishonest person :-(**




I went to a wedding recently. Apart from the bride; a beautiful friend of mine, and her groom I knew only one other person at the wedding. Unbeknown to me, both the bride and groom had spoken to many of their friends/family about me. When introducing myself people would respond by saying they were so pleased to meet me as they had heard what an amazing person I was; what I’ve been through (transplant etc), what I have achieved despite my challenges, my community work, fostering, how I’ve raised my gorgeous boys, and the kind of friend I had been to the bride. I was astonished at how many times I was greeted that way by wonderful people; kind, generous people that all held respectful and admirable roles in the community. EVERY time they complimented me I felt like I was going to vomit; all I could think was how I had lied to the man I love, how because of this I no longer felt like the great person they were referring to me being. I accepted everyone’s compliments graciously, not wanting anymore attention, yet I was churning inside. Then the groom himself, when introducing me to a friend of his, said that next to his beautiful wife I was one of the most extraordinary women he had ever had the privilege to meet. That was it; all too much. I smiled, gave him a hug then soon after exited the reception with a bottle of wine. Sitting beside the nearby water, I was a sobbing mess. 




TL;DR: **My ex and I had something incredibly beautiful, full of promise. I know I have many good qualities, I know I did bring a lot of positive things to our relationship and I gave to him in many positive ways also...but none of that seems to matter anymore, to him or to me. Due to circumstances and insecurities that arose I strayed from who I know myself to be. I lied. Furthermore, I became weak; I cried on my ex’s doorstep begging him to talk to me, to understand me, for months I chased him and tried to fix everything – except myself, it seems. All of this seems to overshadow any good there was, any beauty inside I do have; he can’t see it anymore, and I’m struggling to now.**





**He hates me for who I have become and won't forgive me, which I understand. That aside, and more importantly, I hate myself for who I’ve become, for what I allowed myself to be reduced to, and I don’t know how to forgive myself. I feel flawed in the deepest sense.** 





**I thought I was a good person. What now? Do I ever get to be that person again?**

I've been in a relationship with a 20 year old male for the last 2 months. Before this I was in a 5 year relationship that ended a year ago today (so I waited 8 months to start dating again). 

I can't help but notice that during my last, and current, relationship, as soon as we move from friends to ""dating"" I become an entirely different person. It's like once I get a taste of being with someone I become insecure and dependent. I'm constantly over-analyzing wordings and looking to confront him about silly things even though I'm not a confrontational person normally. 

I generally don't like drama or extra attention and I absolutely hate crying, but it feels like I'm going crazy and always second guessing when I'm with someone.

While I'm single I feel so confident and happy. I love having free time and hanging out with my friends (who are mostly guys), but while in a relationship I just feel bored when I'm alone and then I feel guilty because I realize I'm not the mature woman I should be. 

Why do my hormones go so crazy? Sometimes I feel like I have no control over my emotions. I tell myself to snap out of it, but my motivation to stay rational never seems to work. 

To clarify- I'm not dependent on my SO to do things for me- I just want to be around them constantly. I don't control how much or how long they can have alone time or hang with friends and what not- but I get lonely when I'm on my own and then I get cranky.

I've been fat all my life and that has destroyed my self-confidence with the ladies.  I was also a shy boy all the way up through high school.  I'm currently losing weight but I'm afraid that I'm starting the dating game too late.  I'm afraid that after I lose the weight I'll still lack the self-confidence to impress a girl.  

I've been out with a few girls using online dating sites, but none of these have lasted more than two dates.  Either I find her to be a turn-off, or fat (yes, the pot calling the kettle black, I know - this is another reason I'm losing weight), or if I do like her I have no idea what to do besides act awkward and turn her off.  

I don't have much luck meeting girls in real life, as I'm not really the bar type of person, and my field of work and hobbies are mostly male-dominated.  If I do see a pretty lady I freeze up.  I sometimes wish it was socially acceptable for a girl to ask a guy out.  That would save a lot of headaches for me.

I guess my question is, how can I learn to be confident around women?  Am I doomed, being this old and having never kissed a girl before?

Im currently in a rebound relationship with a 27 [m] for most 1 year and we live together.  I only started dating my current bf bc he was azn and reminded me of the other guy :(

Here is the story: Me and my obsessed lover..

The weeks we spent together were hot/heavy and blissful, we went to concerts, hung w celebs back stage and did drugs, lots of unprotected sex, traveled to XX for more fun. Thats when I told him i wanted more, he respectfully told me he wasnt ready, and then distanced himself.

 I went psycho, fucked one of his friends and tried to screw another out of spite.He found out about both.  I stalked him in a club
, ended up making out with a guy, he saw that too. 

Thats when I cursed him out in an email for being a jerk, and sent that MSTRKRAFT Heartbreaker song on his twitter via DM. That was over a year ago...Ever since, ive been poping up at his job..or clubs i know he frequents , trying to get him to talk to me and he has completely iced me out. When I talk to him he is polite..but just nothing on his end at all. 

Sigh..but i still carry this torch for this man. Idk whats wrong with me. My current bf loves me to pieces..way more educated, more interesting, not as cute,  but totally down for me, and we live together. I just cant stop thinking about the one that got a way.   

Reddit..Please talk some harsh truth into my head. I have fucking issues :(

This is an email he sent me exactly one year ago today: 

Wow! What did I do to have you react the way you did via your recent text? First of all, I crashed when I got home; I didn't read your texts until just now. Even if I had known about your drunken status there's nothing I could have done because XXX drove me back. But seriously though, what is going through your mind? I thought I made my thoughts and intentions pretty clear @ XXXXX a cpl of weeks back but I guess it's apparent that I did not. I will now though. 

We dated for about a month and a half (two weeks of which where I wasn't even in town) and you're reacting like I just ended a serious relationship or something. I enjoyed hanging out with you but things did move faster than it should have and we're BOTH guilty of that. When you expressed your feelings and expectations to me in XX I backed off and distanced myself when we got back and told you then that I wasn't looking for anything serious. But even in spite of that, I felt pressured to be forced into something I wasn't ready for.  And the way you reacted when I wanted to go home the last time we hung out probably didn't help either. I'm sorry for cutting off communication with you afterward, but you un-friending me on FB again and calling me a ""heart-breaker"" made it really difficult for me to talk to you. I really wanted to be friends and have everything be cool between you and me and I thought maybe it could work out that way. It's looking like that may not be possible. For instance, when you hit me up on your way back from XXXX last week my intention was to hang out as friends. I didn't get the same impression from you, as you were implying that we ""sleep together."" Am I a horrible person and a coward because I declined and avoided your recent late night calls? I hope you didn't mean to say what you said earlier in your text, but regardless...if it means anything at all, I'm sorry for hurting you. I hope we can be friends, but if it's going to be like this, I'd rather not be. Take care.

I look at everyone equally when it comes to relationships and attraction.  There are times though, when I just don't get it.


The situation:

This guy I know was in a serious relationship with this girl for a very long time.  A few months ago he decides he's done with it and wants to be free to fuck whomever he wants (I can understand why someone would want to do this, but his reasons were shitty and he's kind of a hipster douche anyways).  My issue was that the way he decided this was not by talking to her, but by waiting for when he was out with the guys alone and then starts intensely macking on another girl.  Terrible.  


This is also not an unusual thing for him to do.....he was constantly doing stuff like this while they were together (checking out and commenting on girl while she hanging out, flirting with bimbos, etc.).


Also, he's not the only guy I know who maintains a steady relationship while acting like that.  I know a bunch of guys who do it.



I need to understand.....why are you attracted to people like this?  If it was only a few of you, I'd get it, but it's not.  It's beyond being attracted to someone confident and charming and straight up into being attracted to scumbags.  Why?



Before anyone gets the wrong idea, I'm not talking about the 'nice guy' thing here.  It's not about being rejected by anyone or angry because girls aren't flocking to me.  It's about constantly seeing girls being with guys that have no business being in a relationship.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_l0xcb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/l0xcb/ladies_please_help_me_understand_27m/,

As my throwaway username suggests, I have recently started to realise how insecure I still am and how much that affects everything I do on a daily basis. I'm a female in my early 30s and I've worked through a lot of issues about my self-worth etc, but I've just realised that I still have an ego to deal with.  

Basically my situation is that I want every person I date to fall in love with me. And so far I've pretty much succeeded. The other aspect about this is that I've never been in love myself. I want to fall in love so badly.  

Through my insecure persona (because I've worried so much about what people think of me), I've learnt how to please people to the extent that I'm a master manipulator. I know when to give attention and I know when to pull away. I always know what to say and how to say it. And men fall for that. So far I haven't met anyone who can see through my bullshit. I hate being this person, but then I love the attention.  

I do realise I have some sort of an attachment disorder, but I don't know how to help myself. I genuinely don't want to hurt anyone, but it just always seems to happen. I don't know how to stop myself. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking ""oh gosh, they're going to think I'm a total bitch"" and ""how can I make this all sounds less fucked up than it is, because I don't want them to think I'm a bitch"". This is how my mind works...  

I don't want any pity-points, I want someone to tell me how to cut all this bullshit out of my life. I'm tired of it.  

I used to be insecure, I still am, but in such a different way. Before I didn't think I was lovable, hated the way I look, thought everything I said was stupid etc... Once I worked through those issues, I actually know my worth now and all that has somehow turned into a bloated ego that needs to be rubbed.  

I want a genuine mutually loving relationship. But the way I am now it's not going to happen. What do I need to do to change? I'm at a loss.

Well I am 21m and for the past five-ish years I have pretty much been in a relationship the entire time. Not with the same girl or anything, but basically dating somebody pretty much the entire time.

I've been in two separate relationships over the fast few years. In the relationships, i would find myself wanting to be out of them after a few months. I wasn't happy and wasn't going to stay in a relationship that just wasn't any fun anymore. Between all the fighting and other stupid problems, it just became not worth it.

Every relationship got to this point (not at specifically a few months, but you get the idea).

Now to my dilemma. Whenever I finally figure out a way to break off the relationship, I feel absolutely amazing. I feel relieved. Like all pressure is gone and I don't have anything else to worry about. And this is consistent for a few weeks... Then I hit the lonely stage. I start missing having somebody around that I know cares about me (and i also care about). So I'll start to look back on the past relationship and I'll compare the good and the bad. And in this instance, the good ALWAYS out the bad. I'll find myself saying ""Welll it wasn't really all that bad"", even though it was absolutely, 100%, that bad.

So I'll decide to call up the ex girlfriend and tell her i miss her, blah blah blah. They'd agree and we'd start dating again. It's an idiotic vicious circle.

I didn't even realize this until a few days, but I literally don't know how to be single anymore. I'm so used to having somebody around that I don't even know how to be content with being by myself.
I don't have a hard life. I have a great job. Great friends. Great family. I should be able to love and enjoy my single life, but everytime I end a relationship, I relapse into the same phase.

Me and my now ex-girlfriend just broke up yesterday. It was the same situation. Fighting, no trust, stupid problems, etc. The same stuff i've been surrounded by for years. I finally told her I just couldn't do it anymore and I knew we were better off not together.

Right now i feel great. Relieved and whatnot. But i know I'll hit that stage again that I always do, so i'm asking for any advice.

Something happened when I was younger and I don't know what to think or make of it. I've never told anyone about this because I'm not sure how people would react. They may think I'm crazy. I think I'm crazy. I change my mind all the time. I don't know what to think.

I'm shaking even thinking about posting this. It's like my big moment of truth, and though probably nobody will even read it, I just feel like one opinion will help a lot. I just want to know the truth. I need to know.

Warning; some graphic description. May make some readers uncomfortable.

I'm a 19 year old female who grew up in a stable family; mum and dad, nice house, no family/personal/financial issues that I know of. During school holidays/vacation, my siblings and I would visit with family members, sometimes staying up to two or three nights in different houses. It was fun to visit and be treated. This lasted throughout our childhood, until we were around 12/13.

When I was 11, my siblings and I stayed with a relative who lives alone. We were getting ready for bed in the lounge when he called me in to say good night. I thought it a little strange that he didn't ask my younger siblings to come in also, but I tucked them into bed and went into his room. He was facing away from me, in bed, and asked me to, ""Come and give him a cuddle."" I walked around to face him and he lifted the blankets, motioning for me to get in. I did, facing him, and he hugged me for a while. He then started to tickle me, which he does often with all the kids, and I squirmed and told him to stop. I hated being tickled, but he was laughing and relaxed and it was a normal thing for him to do. After a little while more of lying in bed, he began to rub my back. I was still wide awake, but his breathing was slow and heavy. His hand slid under my shirt and he kept rubbing my back, under my shirt, until I heard him say, ""Oops!"" and I realised that somehow, my bra had become unhooked. I tried to re-hook it for a bit, but couldn't manage it lying on my side, so I slid it off under my shirt and threw it on the floor. I remember feeling anxious. He said something like, ""Don't worry, we're just cuddling. I love my cuddles."" And continued to rub my back under my shirt. I felt like I was probably shaking and I could hear my heart beating extremely fast. I could feel it in my chest. He continued to rub and suddenly slid his hand up the front of my shirt and rubbed between my breasts. I just remember being terrified. I lay there and let him continue to rub and stroke me, shaking, until I finally came up with a way to leave. I wasn't sure that it would work, as he had me in a tight grip so I couldn't move. But I told him I needed to go to the toilet and he let me go. I picked up my bra and sat on the toilet seat for several minutes. I didn't know whether I should go back to him and give him what I thought he wanted. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do. When I came out, I told him good night and went to the lounge and got into bed with my siblings. I lay away all night and in the morning, everything was like normal. For days after, I didn't really know what to think because I had a very sheltered childhood and couldn't understand what had happened.

I still don't know what to think. Technically, nothing happened. I feel dirty for creating a horrible scenario in my head about someone I love and who loves me, when really he is just a lonely man who wanted a cuddle. And then I think, he can't of accidently unhooked my bra.

He would ask often for me, not my siblings, to come and stay again. I always made up excuses not to go. Five or so years on, I went to stay with him alone for a long weekend to help him clean his house. I decided that I had blown what had happened out of proportion and needed to get over it. By this time I was 15/16. One night as we were getting up to go to bed, he pressed me against a wall and tickled my neck by nuzzling me. I couldn't get away because he had my wrists pinned to the wall next to my face and I could feel his crotch pushed up against mine. He was laughing and I was nervously laughing too. I was terrified but he seemed as though it was a joke. I didn't want to let him know I was scared if he didn't think anything was wrong. He whispered good night and kissed my neck, let me go, and went to bed. I lay awake all night again. I haven't stayed with him since.

I feel dirty and horrible and like the worst person alive for even having these thoughts about this person. I think that he really thinks there's nothing wrong and that it's all in my head. I'm sick. I'm sick to think this about a family member. I feel like I created something out of nothing. I think about these events every day. They have affected how I am around people. I am very closed up and don't form close bonds. I've never had a boyfriend up until recently. He knows that something happened, though I couldn't go further with the details. I feel like if he really knew everything, he'd think I was crazy and sick for even thinking anything of it. I feel like I made it all up in my head and made it worse than what it was. This man is just lonely. I was just company. But I'm scared of him. And I sometimes have intimacy issues with my boyfriend, because I think about this man breathing down my neck, or his smell, or his sweat from that night when I was 11 years old. I'm messed up. This has bothered me for eight long years. It may bother me forever.

Recently, I have just become useless. Other issues, on top of this one, have caused me to lose interest in life completely. I'm not suicidal - I would never kill myself. I just don't see a point to anything. Nothing gives me pleasure, there's nothing to look forward to. I don't see anything in the future. I sit at home all day, I don't have the drive to get a job, I cry every night and just feel sad all the time. I think that dying would be better than being alive. I know this sounds suicidal but I don't want to kill myself, I just want to be dead... if that makes sense? My boyfriend asked if I am depressed and to me, that just sounds ridiculous and selfish. I really have no reason to be depressed. I feel like it's my fault that I'm this way and if I had depression, that would be unfair. There are people far worse off than me, I have no real reason to be depressed. I just... don't want to do anything. I just want to sleep... forever. That's the only way I can describe it.

So yes, I have issues. I can't see a way out of whatever I'm in. And I feel like it all stems from what happened to me when I was eleven years old. And what botheres me the most is that I don't even know if what happened, HAPPENED. Did I just create something horrible out of nothing? Am I just a sick, horrible human with nasty thoughts? Or did something really happen?

I wish I could do a TL;DR, but I feel that all of the details are necessary to determine if something's not right or if I'm just sick in the head. Sorry that this is so long. I have so many thoughts in my head and barely got any out. I hope I didn't ramble too much.

It revolves around making the other person a priority in my life.  Perhaps I am stupid and naive, but when any of my closest friends have ever called with an issue, I have answered the phone promptly, whether it be at 5 am or 11 pm at night, and if I didn't answer the phone, I'd send them a text arranging for a time to talk with them and to make sure that they are alright.  It's very important for me for my friends to feel that they are important to me.  I'll mold my schedule around them, modify my schedule so that if they need me to help them out with something, I am there.  

There are two women in my life that are really trying my patience.  I've been woken up by 5 am phone calls with them crying on the other end, or calls at 4:40 while I am at work telling me how their boyfriend did this this and this, and I talk them through it and try to make them feel better about themselves.  This is all well and good, until I ask for them to make me a priority in their life, not directly, but through other means.

For instance, with girl #1, we've been doing a long distance friendship for almost 18 months (we became best friends in college while she was a senior, and I was a junior.  She has many emotional issues, and I was there for every moment I could possibly be there for, and when those issues followed her home, I continued to be there for her, even if it was simply over the phone or via text.  I would stay on the phone for hours on end trying to make her situation better, and did everything I could for her.  Drove the 6 hrs it took to get there, hung out with her, met her family, etc.  She constantly promised to make the drive and visit me, but through countless excuses (most of which are valid, I believe), she hasn't visited me at my home (I'm now out of college), and I'm afraid that she simply doesn't want to, or rather, I'm not a priority in her life, but simply a lifeline to use when things get bad.

The other situation is similar, although this girl lives 20 minutes down the road.  I've been there for her for the last 4 years, but I simply ask her to meet me for lunch, she says yes, but then ""sleeps through her alarm"" and woke up too late for lunch.  Yet, it seems that if she really wants to do something, she makes it a priority.

* medication (wrecks sex drive, that probably didn't help things, no great improvement in mood either)
* Dating sites (this always ends up being a depressing failure, maybe i'm doing it wrong)

I've always known I had issues with self confidence and maybe self worth, and I've always seen that these relate back to my father. This has never really hindered me until the past couple of years. 

I don't have a lot of experience with guys. I didn't have my first kiss or first boyfriend until I was 19, just about a year ago. That relationship only lasted about two months, and since then I haven't had anything except a very casual FWB. I've had a few guys show their interest in me, and I frankly don't believe them. 

That's what it usually comes back to - I don't genuinely believe that guys want me, like me, are interested in me, or could ever REALLY care about me. Therefore I have very high walls around myself that most guys aren't willing to (and probably shouldn't have to) jump. 

What I'm here for is to hear maybe from other people who have felt this way? I'm guessing this is probably a lot more common than I realize, so how do you get past it? I feel like it's really interfering with some great opportunities for me, and pushing me towards not so great opportunities. Is it just a matter of time and maturity? 

TL;DR I don't really believe guys have any interest in me, and I'd like to change my perception.

Also, I SUCK at just ""putting myself out there"" (but it's something else I am working on) so suggestions beyond that would be appreciated :)

A bit about me first:  I've been in one relationship that lasted all of two months a few years ago and that was the most 'successful' relationship I've been in.  I used to be really fat and unattractive.  I also battled with depression throughout my teenage years.  I got into cycling a few years ago, dieted, and lost a lot of weight.  I worked hard revamped my fashion sense, i exercise regularly now, and eat healthy for the most part.  I also grew up a lot since then.  I have seriously self esteem issues though, as I don't feel like I'm worthy of dating most of the time.  Probably due to my lack of success, prior body image issues, and being raised without a father figure in an asian home (my family was not very affectionate). 
These days I feel a lot better about myself but it's hard for me to see any positive aspect when I look at myself.  

Flashforward to the past few months.  Met a girl online on a dating site, chatted for a while, went to meet her and had a great time. We really hit it off.  Cut to tonight and her online dating profile is back up (she took it down a few weeks back) and I just had a huge flood of emotions and negative feelings about myself.

We've only hung out for a weekend and I know I shouldn't be this irrational about a stupid dating profile being reactivated.  My logical brain is telling me that I should not be emotional about this, that I'm being desperate and needy, but my illogical brain is flooding me with negative thoughts like ""she isn't into me"", ""this relationship isn't going anywhere"", ""you're useless"" etc.  

I feel like I put a lot of stock in being in a relationship, probably because I haven't had a real one ever and I'm already 25.  Really unhealthy, I know.  Ideally I should be busy with my own life and taking care of my own things, which I do, but right now I'm out of school for the summer, working part time, and have a lot of free time.

I've been really depressed lately, to the point of fantasizing about leaving my family or committing suicide.
I was 14 or 15 and went to the house of a friend of a friend to jam out with some of his friends that I hadn't met. One of his buddies brought his little sister along, let's call her Amy. She was 13 i think, I was a freshman, she was in 8th grade. I immediately was drawn to her. She was adorable and very friendly. I couldn't wait to see her again after that night. I would get butterflies and get nervous anytime I would hear that her brother was going to be around in hopes that she would be there. Her brother and I became really good friends and were in several bands together over the next few years. I fell in love with her quickly, my mutual buddy knew it and he always talked me up around her. Word got around and her brother knew as well, and we would joke about it. I never had the balls to tell her even though I would bring her flowers occasionally, and would go ot of my way for her. She was a small time model. She was gorgeous. Me, an overweight not even close model. Bad self esteem. Her older bro left for college and I would still see her around. Always greeted with excitement and a huge hug. She always made me feel better about myself. She fronted a band and I was asked to fill in on occasion. We became good friends, because of how gorgeous she was AND she was in a band, she had guys all over her constantly. We made it to 20 or so and by then our relationship was playful. We would pinch each others butts in public, as a game. We would try to catch the other off guard. Go to the beach together and I would run the douche bags off who would annoy her. I would come to her and her roomates' place to be greeted by them both in their underwear jumping on me with a stradling hug they both seemed overjoyed to see me. Two smoking hot girls in their underwear, all over me, completely platonically. By then it was, me still madly in love. We hit a few years together at a community college. She always hugged me and kissed my cheek and sneek a pinch at my ass when i would look away. We would be in different relationships and be there for each other when they failed. By 21 I moved away. She stayed. I lost touch for yearswith both her brother and her, last I heard, she was having a baby. Now I'm 30 years old, married with a few kids and i had a dream about Amy. It was about the 1st time I met her. Both of us, kids. We were in a 14 and 15 year old embrce and she whispered for me not to go in my ear and kissed me. I got in touch with her brother, I really did miss him though, we were really good buds. And through social networking, I found her and we conversed and caught up a little. But the excitement of ""me"" she once always had to see or talk to me wasn't there. She's married, a few kids, a little heavier than I last saw her, but still the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. All the feelings came back in the dream and just about killed me when I saw her now. I shoud've said something when I had the chance. I didn't have the courage, even if I would have been friend zoned, I would've maybe got over it. Or even if she felt the same and it didn't work out, I still would've had a chance wit her. She looks happy now. I wouldn't dare say anything to her or my wife about it. But I am now more depressed because of it, to the point where my wife keeps asking if I am asleep or not. I was already battling the depression, now it feels like heartache stacked on top. I know it'll pass and I'll move on.

I have also become far more socially anxious since my start of freshmen year of college (I am going to be a senior), which I don't know how that is even possible.





I keep thinking back to my freshmen year. How I was so open to everybody and not thinking about what people think about me or how I can try to please people or appease them into enjoying my company. I was just myself. If that worked and I made friends, great, if that didn't work and people didn't want to be around me, also great.



I keep thinking back to my first summer after college, when I worked with my best friend and how amazing that was. How I worked with a bunch of other amazing people and I wasn't dwelling on the past, I wasn't thinking about the future (except maybe getting to go back to school, which was fun).



But nowadays I keep dwelling on those times. Everyone I meet I am suddenly thinking a million different things about ""Do I want to be friends with this person? ""Does this person like me?"" ""Can I form a personal or intimate relationship with this person?"" ""Why does this person not talk to me as much as x?"" ""How can I act to make this person like me more?"" 



Questions I NEVER contemplated just a few years ago, at least not to the extent I am now. I am currently doing a potentially AMAZING thing for the summer, but all I can think about is the past. And before the summer, I couldn't look forward to this thing. I am never truly happy in the ""now"" - and it has not always been that way. 



I WANT to stop dwelling on the past, but the past makes me happy...in a very sad way. I LIKE to dwell on it, but I know that is incredibly unhealthy. 


Maybe it's because I haven't met anybody I truly like at the place I'm in now compared to the place I was a few years ago, or maybe it's because I am ""lost"" without that rock of a best friend. Or maybe it's because my social anxiety has skyrocketed, and I cannot feel like I can be myself around people anymore. But I don't know what is causing this. I can't enjoy going out with the friends I made here because when I do, I just think about how much BETTER going out with the friends I made a few years ago was - even if going out with friends now is a perfectly fun experience. I am constantly feeling like I want the past because the past was better. And when I try to quit thinking about the past I get even more sad because that means all I have is the now, which is not so great.

I don't see any common symptoms present in me that are often associated with being interested in someone , however I can't get her out of my head. She just pops into my mind from time to time, also, I find it vary easy to spot her in the crowd.

Fortunately this girl is a friend of a friend of mine, so, I also often find her at parties, which I attend fore sole reason to get to know her better, but sadly results have been insignificant due to my social inadequacy and lack of communication skills.

Although direct stalking is unacceptable on my part, I do find myself eavesdropping on conversations regarding her to find out more information, and with limited success and indecisive accuracy I determined that she has a lot of characteristics in her personality that I find attractive.

I figure my biggest problem is that I'm a vary cynical person and don't believe in ""unconditional love"", and obviously never experienced it.

I understand that my chances of entering in a relationship with this girl are virtually impossible. Its just something I'd like to figure out for myself and decide my next course of actions.

Ohhh man I fucked up bad this time. Sorry if this turns into a rant, I'm feeling pretty distressed at the moment.

OK, so. Me (20f) and my boyfriend (25m) have been together for almost two years now, and living together for almost as long. We've had our bumps, but overall I think we have a good relationship, and I love him lots.

Recently he's been feeling depressed, as he kind of has for years, but I thought t was work-related (he was taking a teacher training course and it was killing him). But the other day he came home feeling particularly sad, and ended up telling me that he doesn't trust me anymore, and that he feels he can't talk to me about anything, especially not his problems, because he doesn't think I care about him at all, and that I just want to use him.
 He has helped me heaps with my problems in the past  and now thinks I am just with him so he can solve my problems.

His arguments are this. I used to get jealous when he spoke to this one girl, because he spoke to her ALL the time, all night long, he would always take an almost hour long bus back with her to walk her home when we went out in groups (and he'd tell me not to bother going with them), he'd basically just do so much for her. So yes, I admit, I got jealous. But I got to realise that that is how he speaks to girls, and he'd do it for anyone. But now he thinks I will get like this with any girl he talks to and so tells me he feels depressed when he talks to girls because he thinks I will get angry.

On that note, he always thinks I am angry at him. He constantly apologises for nothing, as soon as that new girl he talks to (who btw is about to move in with us) is around, he spends his time telling me sorry. Even though I give no indication of being angry... because I'm not!

I did try to get him to open up to me, to share his problems with me, to let me help him feel better, but he never would. And now I'm afraid it's too late, he doesn't trust me and our relationship is doomed to fail. Oh and we also just signed a one year lease on a flat, so I'm afraid he's feeling that pressure too...

I don't understand, not two weeks ago he mentioned that he'd like to eventually marry me. I'm not a marriage freak, he knows I don't put any importance in getting married, so he didn't have to say that at all. Why would you want to marry someone you don't trust?

I need help. How can I show him that I care about him, that I love him, that I am happy for him to talk to people, if he won't talk to me?

One last thing. The thing that sparked this if recently is this. Tuesday was the last day teaching the class he's been following for years and has grown to really like. I knew that was soon, but I forgot it was  that specific day. He then thought that this was because I didn't care about him enough to remember. Problem is... he didn't actually ever tell me to was Tuesday. His answer to this, and t when I told him I wasn't a mind reader and needed him to talk to me and communicate, was: ""yes but I am a mind reader, I know when you are sad and when stuff happens to you, so I expect everyone to be the same"". 

 I realise I have been quite selfish recently, and we've done more things I wanted than he wanted... but I also feel that that is because  I was ""filling in the gap"" of him not talking to me and not sharing his problems with me. This has been a one sided relationship, and most of it is my fault, but not all.

Sorry for the uber long text... I need help. I have no one to talk to that is not a ""shared"" friend with my boyfriend.

It all started because he had offered to be in a domestic partnership, in light of my recent breakup, as a way to secure my envious return to the country, and to validate the effort i had put into accumulating a new language and culture.  A sexual relationship evolved and he enjoys being with me in other ways as well, but is consumed by guilt at the wedge he has created in the group.  I have made my case about staying together multiple times now, but I am tired of serious conversations.  He is currently thinking it over in the countryside.  I don’t know whether to keep fighting anymore.

I have tried and failed to make a long story short.

I was with my ex boyfriend for 3 years, most of it long distance, and this last year we subsequently broke up after living together.  All this taking place in a foreign country to me.  To have moved here, I took language classes, created an income from tutoring english and maintaining it by living minimally, made new friends...I invested time, effort, and emotion.  

We broke up after he had admitted to cheating on me during a trip to Cuba.  This happened two months ago, and he confessed a few days after he returned.  He wrote it in a letter and said he didn’t feel bad or sorry about it, he thought it was a good thing actually.  Oh boy.  

I disappeared for two days but came back after deep reflection and tried to understand his point of view and why he had cheated.  I forgave him (though he wasn’t sorry).  We made a list of things we could do to build the relationship, slept together in the same bed, shared a few laughs.

Mine and my ex’s plan for a long time had been to register as a domestic partnership, ensuring a future return option to the happy-go-lucky lifestyle I have here.  See, tutoring is nice and i’m my own boss, but isn't my passion, so I’ll be going home to pursue an internship and get a few job hookups...see my family and friends...speak english.  But all with the hopes that I can learn some skills in the States and come back over the pond for some applicaton.

We had solidified this plan a week before we broke up.  I asked him, ‘Do you still want to be my domestic partner?”  and he said, “Yes” and kissed me.

We broke up a week later, after I go in for a kiss, and he dancingly backs off, singing “distance!”

I can’t believe I was ever with this clown.

I move to the couch downstairs and we frustratedly ignored each other for a week until one day, he enters my den and sits down.  He asked me if I had thought about what I was going to do with my future?...this insecurity was one of his reasons he cheated.  I was just shocked by his approach.  I moved here to be with him, excuse me if I have just graduated from college and didn’t find a career plan in a foreign country.

I told him that we both know we don’t want to be with the other.  He deceived me in regards to the domestic partnership.  I will leave in very poor form this country which I had come to love. 

Despite my frustration with him, we had a bit of a post mortem conversation, played backgammon and smoked a joint.  Things were genial.  

And luckily, just a week before we broke up, my oldest friend/twice ex-boyfriend had moved into the house.  Therefore I had gotten over the breakup quickly enough, sexually speaking...and also he was a good support system emotionally, telling me that he respected me for having a good head on my shoulders throughout this debacle.  

Nonetheless, I was still moping about the fact I had no way of coming back.  And things were not long term with me and my oldest friend.  He proposed to his girlfriend a week later.

The next weekend, I go out with my (F) roommate one weekend.  We meet up with some people she knows through my other (M) roommate and his buddy (read: my ex's buddy as well.  They all know each other through the same group of university friends), who she was occasionally having sex with.  We partied a bit hard and the three of us, me, my (F) roommate, and buddy ended up back at his apartment.  I don't remember the specifics of the conversation there, but in my drunken ramblings I was complaining about being squeezed out of a domestic partnership and how betrayed I felt.  The buddy apparently offered up his little brother to me.  That ngiht we slept like sardines on the bed.

The next morning I woke up and left them to have some alone time, trying to make up for the cock blocking I had done the night before.

A week later my ex upsets me for shitting all over an idea I had about my next move in life, after he asked me again of my future plans.  I was vulnerable and feeling down, so I went upstairs and cried, and reemerged, heavy hearted and confiding in my (F) roommate about my state of my affairs.  She holds me and tries to cheer me up by jokingly reminding me that buddy had offered up his little brother.  In the heat of desperation I said something along the lines of, ""Oh, yeah, I should really get his number"".

Apparently sometime after this meeting, (F) roommate shoots off a text to buddy saying that I might really want to meet his little brother, or that I seem pretty desperate, somewhere in that genre of pity.

A week or two later, we threw a party at our house.  In preparation, myself and (F) roommate stocked the bar, cleaned, etc, though we had invited no one.  The insignificant 5th roommate in the house, who invited 50 people, twiddles his thumbs and watches us work.  My ex, who invited plenty of people, eventually shows up after midnight.  People are being stupid, belligerent drunks.  It was a fucking mess, and I was hating every second of it.  The music was shitty, and the DJ nearly had a meltdown when I asked him to lower the music.  It was ridiculous.  

In the middle of this bordelique shitfest, buddy asks me if we can speak outside for two minutes.  We go on the balcony which is filled with loud, wasted people (our poor neighbors) and he starts on about how much time and effort I invested into being in this country.  That getting a domestic partnership is just a matter of paperwork, and worth it so that I can stay.  I can barely hear him, and he's fairly soft-spoken, so I say, ""Yeah, I should look up your little brother""

He looks at me confused and says, ""No, I'm talking about me.  I won't be married for another 2 years at least, I'm not looking anyway, and it's just a matter of paperwork.  I can help you out.""

My eyes lit up and it was like I was really looking at him for the first time.  It is such a kind gesture and in that moment I realized what an incredibly nice man he is.  But I ask him anyway, ""You're not doing this to fuck me, right?""

He assures me that it has nothing to do with that.  And I believe him.  I ask if he's any longer with my (F) roommate and he says, ""I prefer her as a friend"".  He told me that he asked my ex if having a domestic partnership with me bothers him.  My ex told buddy that he didn’t care, so there we go.  Buddy texts me his email in case I ever need anything.  We go back inside.

The incompetent party continues but I am running around, cleaning up everyone's mess with a spring in my step.  I am sweeping broken glass off the floor when the buddy swoops me up and carries me outside and tells me that I should be having fun, not cleaning.  He holds me and smiles with his eyes.  I wriggle out and go back to cleaning so that we weren't sued in the morning.

Everybody finally passes out.  The sun is up.  Buddy gets next to me in bed and gently puts his hand on my hip.  The next morning we wake up and he takes my arm and puts it under his head and cuddles me.  As this is happening, (F) roommate walks in and sees us.  I think, from her lack of reaction, that things indeed must have cooled between them.

Fast forward a few days later.  I'm in the town and my oldest friend blows me off.  I sent off a text to the buddy asking if we can grab a beer and talk about this domestic partnership thing.

We meet up and he gets the first round, I get the second.  We’re halfway to losertown in a blind quiz when the pitcher appears.  I knew where it was headed, the signs were clear.  I kissed him outside the bar and at the end of the night he unneedingly asks, “Are we going to mine?”.  I sit on the handlebars of my bike as he pedals and sings in my ear.  

We make love, again and again.  He is an adonis, strong and gentle.  He is a cool person and a good conversationalist, he remembers what I say in conversation and quotes me.  We laugh a lot and have a great time.  He loves to be held, and his head is often on my bosom.  We both feel good.  

We’re in bed when he asks what should we say to the people around us about us?  We agree to say nothing.  We just want to give it a try, we said.  No need to put pressure on us.  I’m leaving in two months, so let’s just have some quiet fun.

That plan blows up pretty quickly due to the fact that I live with my (M) roommate and (F) roommate.  They put 2 and 2 together pretty quickly, when they saw me struggling to look good the next weekend before I went out.  They asked me who I was flirting with that night and I kind of hesitated in my response.  Some friend of my oldest friend.  And they called their buddy to see what he was up to, and he said he was with a friend.  They all speak one of those old gendered languages so they are like, “Oh...who’s the dame?”, and they became suspicious when he was tepid on the subject.

Being exposed in the way we were made us cringe; we hadn’t acted like adults and and we felt bad.  I really love my (F) roommate and never meant to hurt her.  She was upset that I had taken her for an idiot.  I apologized as best as I could.

With that dose of guilt sloppily resolved, the buddy and I have a sexy weekend.  But it was interrupted by a slew of angry texts we had both received from my ex.  My ex is not as tight with this buddy so he found our relationship out a week later.  He wrote that he wished he never met me.

I texted him back, saying we would speak that later that night.  We took a walk through the city streets, him toting him bike, and railing on about how there are so many men in this city, why did I have to sleep with his friend?  He then irrelevantly spiraled off and unearthed a whole recap of the failures in our relationship.  I asked him if I stopped seeing his buddy, would he go back to being friends with him?  He said he didn’t know and pedaled away to a party of his friends, the same group of college kids he knows his buddy through.  They didn’t talk much at the shindig, but the impression was clearly that my ex wanted some distance from him.  My ex then chugged a beer and left the party.  

The last functioning drunk at the party approaches the buddy and says something like, “Hey little husband” in reference to him partnering with me.  That much is apparently known among the members of the group.  But the buddy in his utter emotional dilemma confessed to this friend that we had had sex and that’s why my ex wasn’t there for long.

The next morning, my ex picks another fight with me.  He has now also found out that I slept with my oldest friend, and wants nothing to do with him, either.  Things escalate and he puts his hands on me, which I never in a million years thought he would do.  I saw him handle being ripped off by his old roommates with admirable grace, and I thought he was always so emotionally controlled.  Not this, he was really upset.

That night, I meet up with the buddy to discuss his feelings.  We talk, I try to convince him that I’m his friend’s ex for two months now, that my ex is perhaps mad about me having sex in general (as per his response to finding out I had slept with my oldest friend) and that if we stop seeing each other now then all this shit we stirred up will have been for nothing.  We’re kissing all the meanwhile but anyway he says, he needs some time to think about it.

The next day he sends me a text saying he thinks we shouldn’t see each other anymore.  It being a textual conversation, I was court with my disappointment but thankful for his continuing willingness to partner with me. 

The day after that, my ex and I get to talking again and we bury the hatchet.  We shake hands and he apologizes for the first time for having hurt me when he cheated on me.  Since then we have been very pleasant with each other.  He’s either one hell of an actor or he’s truly calmed down.

The day after I sent the buddy a text asking about some papers for the partnership, and also to tell him that my ex and I are on good terms.  We meet up in the park and we are stroking each other as he says his decision is non-negotiable.  I make my case again about validating what we went through, giving it a try, and also that all my ex is asking for is some distance, he doesn’t want to know or care what we do, and he’s much more at peace now.  In fact, that very night my ex had brought over a girl to the house to cook dinner for, and I was counting on buddy to hang out with me a little while so I didn’t have to go back early.  He happily obliged to play billiards with me so I don’t go home prematurely, and we make our way over to a hall.

On the way over, we’re talking but it’s fairly littered with innuendos, about him being a heartbreaker and whatnot.  He stops in the middle of the journey and says that I have him in my pocket and we kissed.  We got at the billiard hall, betted on a couple of sexual favors, and headed back to his place.

The next night, he has a drink with (M) roommate to talk things over.  (M) roommate thinks this whole thing is a bad idea.  He thinks it’s a violation of the bro-code.  Despite the fact that the girl my ex brought over the night before was once (M) roommate’s love interest.  (M) roommate is a real man of principle. 

I was worried so I sent a message to buddy, asking him that he keep me up to date with his feelings because they effect mine.  He asked if we could meet up over the weekend.  I was convinced that this would be the end because (M) roommate and buddy are tight.  I was all ready to say that I will be friends with him, for his mind’s sake.

Saturday comes and he approaches me in the park with a crisp “Hey lady” and kisses me on the mouth.  He tells me that he feels bad about what happened with my ex and his friends (he thinks his other friends have lost trust in him), but when he’s with me life is beautiful.  And he wants to spend time with me and if or until the guilt gets too overwhelming, we’ll be good friends otherwise.  I was happy with that, and we went back to his and made love.  We both had plans that night so we parted ways, with plans to see him play tennis with his little brother the day after.

Well, he had partied hard and wasn’t feeling very sportive the next day.  But the way he worded his texts, saying, ‘take care’ and signing his name...I knew something was off.  

I waited three days and then I called him.  I was in town and wanted to know if I could stop over.  He said yes.  I go over and he tells me he talked with another friend, and he feels bad about us again.  He thinks we shouldn’t be together, or even get a domestic partnership.  I am exhausted, tired of making the same argument, and basically just call him a loser.  He says, “Fuck you.”  I say, “Yeah, fuck me”.  He did.

We had a great time as usual, and in the morning he told me he was going to the countryside with his family to reflect.  I told him I wanted him to talk to someone, his family or a stranger, but someone not from his friend group who can shed some unbiased opinions.  I wanted him to hold on to the partnership agreement, because I already spent more money, more time, and more effort reloading the process.  Most importantly, it’s obvious that this partnership was the birth of our relationship, so if we broke that off then we really went through a whole bunch of social awkwardness, friendship straining bullshit for nothing.  

This is where he currently is: in the countryside, pondering over life.  I am currently at home, on a saturday night, writing this.  He told me don’t fret about it, that I should have a good weekend.  I can’t.  

I need some advice.  I don’t know if I’m in the right.  Things are resolved with him and my (F) roommate; in fact, her, my (M) roommate and him are looking to move into a house with another friend.  I have extinguished the tension at home, and I believe that my ex’s behavior towards me predicts that one day in the future my ex and his buddy will be able to put it behind them.

I would let him go, except that we get on so well with one another.  He makes me happy, and I make him happy, and I want to fight for that, and convince him if I can that it’s okay for us to see each other.  I hope this isn’t wishful thinking.  I know I can’t control the thoughts or actions of others but is there something I can do to help my desires be realized?

Thanks for tuning in.

Any advice for me?,DoorScreen,6,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1gd1fz/myf23_motherf48_is_dating_a_manm40_who_is_a_lying/,"Background info: my mom and dad are both alcoholics, and things hadn't gone well with them at all. Mom is depressed (on meds now) and dad badmouths her really bad, didn't even believe in her depression. Apparently when my dad was in a month-long work trip my mother started an affair with my father's friend/ex-co-worker (let's call him Mark). On Christmas, when me and my brother[M20] were visiting our parents they got REALLY drunk and started fighting worse than usually because dad found out about mom's affair with Mark (just word fight, never physical abuse I mind you), so me and my brother decided to leave, since for the first time we had the possibility to do so. Day after we left parents got drunk again, mother started to cut herself (""to see what your dad would do"", she later told me) and was taken to a hospital to calm down. She hasn't really been home after that.
 
So she's been now dating Mark for 6 months or so. Dad has gotten little better with his alcohol problem, so it's only mom who I have issues with. I don't mind my parent's divorcing (it's underway) and dating other people, but Mark is such a rotten apple I have trouble being in touch with my mother. Literally. Mark is really possessive of mom, and bad drunk since he gets violent. He lies to mom all the time and breaks her stuff and steals her car keys, driver's licence, what ever he feels like will keep mom around him. Mom has countless of times ""gotten sick with him"" and went to home for a sanctuary, only to be back at his place the next day. During her brief stays at home she and my dad get drunk again and start fighting, dad calling her a whore etc etc. She always promises she'll never go back to Mark, but she always breaks her promise (because she says she loves Mark). I have lost all faith in my mother and feel that I can't trust her anymore... I'm even thinking about uninviting her to my upcoming wedding to avoid the disappointment of not having her there (I doubt Mark would let her to come since my dad will be there).

I don't understand why mom decides to stay with Mark; he is clearly using her for her money (since Mark is unemployed - but mom only makes about 1,5k€/month) and using sweet talk to get what he wants. She has huge debt and buys all the booze/cigarettes they use. Mark has also threatened my father multiple times, and maybe even me and my brother (mom wouldn't tell everything when we ask, she just says ""I'll tell you when you're older""). I'm sad that I have lost my mother, she haven't listened to me and my brother when we have stated our concerns about her dating. 
  Is there anything me and my brother could do to make her realize that being with Mark is the biggest mistake of her life? Any advice from people who have been in the same kind of situation as my mom? What has made you to stop dating the wrong man that you have loved?

If there is something you need clarifications with, feel free to ask.

Looking back, it explains a lot of behavior on his side. When we started dating, I told him that if anything changes on his side, if his feelings change or he wants to see other people, just let me know. I'm grown and can handle it. So, the whole time we were together, I thought I was in a great relationship. I thought we were on the same page with a lot of important stuff like how we'd like to raise our children, we worked out together, we played board games together, pretty much enjoyed the same music. Most of the time, when we're together, we were really spending quality time and this is something very new to me. We were best friends... or so I thought because after 1.5 years I discovered that he has slept with multiple women a few months in a relationship and I'm not sure if it continued the whole time nor does that make any difference. But I felt so betrayed and disrespected. In the end, I guess I was wrong about being compatible. 

My question now is, coming from this sort of relationship where I thought everything was so great, etc. I can't really imagine myself trusting someone again. I can't imagine starting to date someone and not be wary when that person is out or whatever. Will I even be able to trust again?

I know I'm not supposed to judge the whole male population based on one bad apple but I've seen and heard stories from my co-workers and watched too many tv shows where someone is always cheating on someone else.

Background: She's been my friend for years now, and she's had issues for a long time... never quite this bad, though. She was begging me not to call her parents, but I was too worried for her - it felt like too much of a gamble with her life not to call them - I don't think she quite meant to cut as deeply as she did, and it was right into her upper thighs. There was quite a lot of blood. I forewarned her that I felt I needed to call her parents/wake them up to go check on her and take her to accident and emergency, but it still feels like a betrayal of her trust - and she's pretty pissed off with me for it.

Current shit: I felt I didn't have a choice, and it was too risky to just leave it be - in normal circumstances, I'd have just talked her down from cutting again, got her to clean herself up, and leave things be - but she hadn't stopped bleeding for a long time. I erred on the side of caution and told her parents to check on her. I feel like I've lost the trust of one of my best friends - but if I hadn't, I was gambling with her life.

He made me feel childish for wanting out of it, and claimed that there was no such thing as person that would be happy monogamous. (he has since lost his ability to pick up girls and tried drunk texting me- I politely asked him to stop and he has dulled it down to sending 'i miss you' texts every now and then)

A year later I got into a serious relationship with a guy of the same age that I went to highschool with. We've been dating for a little over nine months. Everything had been peachy, I had been really happy, until more recently when I've been acting completely crazy.

He mentioned that he wanted to get a blanket back to a girl he used to have a thing with, and that she was texting him asking him to hang out, and even though he said it was nothing to worry about I WORRIED SO MUCH.

Then a mutual friend came into town that he used to be close with and that I have been friends with since kindergarden.

Some background information:
I am 18(m)
I live in Australia, and culturally, hail from eastern Europe.
I am completing my final year of schooling before university, have plans to move onto engineering, and an Australian girlfriend (17) of slightly more than a year.


So, my parents decided that they would like to move back to their homeland. They talked about it a bit, but it wasn't serious until about one and half months ago when my father went to the homeland and bought a house there.
Now they have plans to move there, along with me,  in approximately one year.

The problem is I don't want to go. At all. I want to attend university here, I have a girlfriend here who I would hate to uproot, even though she said she would come. I have friends, and feel part of the culture here, and would rather identify as Australian as it means  I'm not bound to a set of actions, ideals, or beliefs due to where my parents were born.

My parents don't like this at all. Last night they told me to not invite her back here, to finish my exams, and they called me a traitor to my kind, giving up heritage and values for ""some stupid girl""

My relationship with my parents isn't very good. They're a bit controlling and untrusting. They use tracking software on my phone to trace me and often tell me how I wouldn't be able to survive here on my own.
They scare me, telling me that my girlfriend will leave me and I'll come crawling back to them anyway.

There are so many bad things I could also say about them, but I haven't the time or effort to give..
They can also be nice,
But only when they get their way.

What do I do?
I don't want to go with them, but what if they're right? What if I can't survive without them?
I would prefer to remain here with my girlfriend and my friends and where I feel like I belong.
I've been to the homeland a few times before and never really felt like I clicked with the people..
But I also love my little brother who's only twelve and is going to be dragged along as well, if he likes it or not.

On the way home, instead of re-living the sweet moments of the date and smiling happily to myself, I kept thinking whether I made the right choice in agreeing to go out with him. In fact, I also thought of doing what we did on our date with ANOTHER friend and that I might even be happier with him (although I'm quite sure I don't like the friend in that sense).
This is my first time dating anyone and I don't know whether I really like him as a boyfriend, or is this just me wanting to date for the sake of it and he just happened to ask me out at the right time. The date actually felt like 2 friends going out for a casual dinner, only difference is we were holding hands. When he hugged me quite intimately and held my hand tonight I didn't feel anything and to be honest I'm quite upset about that because I was so sure that the feelings are mutual. When we were saying goodbye, he was like ""i don't want you to leave"" and kept hugging me. I thought that was really cute but I wasn't sad about having to leave him at all. I am so confused right now and I feel quite burdened by the fact that I'm someone's 'girlfriend', rather than the 'free soul' that I was 3 days ago.
I tried figuring out my feelings about him by looking at his picture but frankly it just made me even more confused. One minute I feel like I don't mind going out with him because he treats me right and is really sweet. The next minute, everything seems wrong again. Also, it felt extremely awkward when he pulled me into a cuddle while we were seated on a bench chatting, I couldn't even bear to turn my head to look at him when I talked because he was so close to me.

I'll do the tl:dr first -  Have a great relationship with an amazing girl for past 17 months. I don't want to be in it anymore and no idea what to do about it.

So basically, I've been divorced for 2 years now, and started dating this girl who's awesome, sweet, caring, educated, pretty, etc. and it's just been amazing. We get along, we travel well together, sex is exciting and fun and as frequent as I can handle, but I know she wants marriage and children. I mean, it's like, the core of her being to want these things. I don't. I had marriage and I have a child (singular), so I've put a wall up between us because I believe it's a short term relationship on this basis. She tells me it's not important now and she's not ready for those things yet either and when she is, we can table it then - that just feels like delaying the inevitable so it's really preventing me to be wholly present in the relationship and really enjoy ""us"".

So I start nitpicking things I don't like about her in my head (never communicate this) to further turn me off from her. I'm ruining the relationship. I don't know how to get my head around not doing this because I really believe we want different things long term.

She's madly in love, always talking about soul mates, and how she can't believe how lucky she is, and how perfect we are, etc. and she's an extremely sensitive person prone to depression, so I feel like there is a lot of responsibility on my shoulders. How do you break up with someone when everything is great? So I stay in the relationship, but am not fully present, and that makes me feel like shit because I can't enjoy what I have and our time together.

Details inside.,chaoticadversary,7,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1dv6x7/i_never_want_to_hang_out_with_anyone_girlfriend/,"Hi everyone. I'm a 24 year old male. Last night my girlfriend and I had an argument about what she calls my ""anti-social attitude."" I looked up what this term actually means on the internet, and I am certainly not a psychopath who feels no remorse or consideration for others. I'm not violent or constantly angry. However, I do have a very hard time sympathizing with others, even my friends, or caring about what's going on with other people. In fact, I hardly ever think about others. I normally think about things that interest me, things I'm doing or want to do, etc. I rarely want to go out and spend time with friends. Pretty much any time I end up going out, it's because someone else asked me to. I never feel the need or desire to ask someone to hang out with me. I hardly ever feel lonely though. It's just not something that occurs to me. But when people do reach out and want to spend time with me, it's really difficult to motivate me to get out of the house and spend time with anyone. It's almost like there's this wall blocking even the vaguest interest or desire to do anything with others. I'm really content to just do whatever the hell I want and not worry about what others are doing. And it's difficult for me to engage in activities that other people want to do unless it's something that I truly would like to do. The problem is, most of the things people my age find interesting I think are extremely boring. Like parties, most concerts or festivals (I'm a fan of black metal and my favorite bands rarely tour in the U.S. if they tour at all), things like that. I really really hate parties. People play shitty music and dance and drink and talk about bullshit that I don't care about. I know, I know, I'm a very negative person. 

Anyway, I was thinking it might have something to do with my upbringing. I was born into a Navy family, and we moved around constantly. Until I was 19 or 20, I never stayed in one place for more than 3 or 4 years at a time. I was forced to change friends frequently because of this, and never became too attached to any place or any particular person. In this way, I was forced to rely on myself and my immediate family for comfort, things to do, or whatever. In high school and middle school, I was a loner even within my own family. My brother and sister had a lot more in common with each other than either did with me, so they got along better and I was forced to entertain myself most of the time. 

In college I was friends with the people who lived in my dorm, and it was a very clique-y group of people. But the problem I had with them was that they were extremely passive aggressive and judgmental. We were all part of a writing program within the dorm, and we were really isolated within our own group. But everyone seemed to be very judgmental and disapproving of everyone else. I didn't realize how much this affected me and how much I disliked those people until after I graduated and wasn't in such close quarters with them. I think I may not like being with large groups of people and wary of small groups in part because I'd rather just do my own thing, and not have to pretend or act a part to avoid ridicule. 

My girlfriend seems pretty fed up with this attitude I have about people and activities. She's extroverted and is always up for going out and spending time with people. But I rarely have any interest in doing that kind of thing. She's pretty sick of it, thinks I have my head up my ass, and doesn't understand why I hate people so much. I do feel some hatred for people, but not my friends. I just feel this crippling indifference. I know this is probably very alienating for my friends and they will eventually get tired of me and not even bother anymore. This happened with my college friend circle. Eventually they just stopped calling me. It's possible that will happen with this other circle of friends, and while I wouldn't like that to happen because I do like them, at the same time, I find it very difficult to motivate myself to spend time with them, especially since the activities they're interested in rarely interest me. 

I imagine people will suggest that I make an offer to my friends for an activity that I want to do. The problem with that is that many of the things I enjoy doing are things that are done alone, like reading, playing video games, listening to music, etc. So I'm not really sure what to do. On the one hand, I really have a hard time caring. But on the other hand, I realize this may hurt me in the future and it certainly pisses off my girlfriend. 

Is there something wrong with me? I guess that's my big question. Is this just the way that I am and there's nothing to be ashamed of? Am I terrible narcissistic loner? Is this some kind of psychological problem I should work on?

We started dating about 8 months ago, and it's been great. I mean by far the best relationship I've ever had. She's pretty attractive, and one of the nicest girls ever. A complete angel. So I have to say I'm pretty damn happy. 

That's the good, now the bad. I'm in rotc and the national guard. I know that when I graduate college (in 2 years) I'll be going active duty in the army, and I'm sure we'll be back to war by then. So I'm fairly certain that I'll get deployed. Just as a personal thing, I don't want to be married before that happens because I don't want to be worrying about my family (if something happens to me) more than those under my command. 

I think most people find their future spouse in college, and if I continue dating this girl she won't have that opportunity, unless she's willing to wait on me for another 4 years after college. 

So on the one hand I want to stay with her because I really like her, on the other it may be better for her in the long run if she wasn't with me... A piece of additional info: I've been her first everything, from first kiss to her first time.

Now a caveat. I kinda feel like this is all in my head. This has been my longest relationship to date and I'm starting to miss the single life a bit. I feel like I'm too young to enter a relationship that may end in marriage. I'm not ready for that type of commitment, but I think she is looking for that.

1366921941.0,5,self.ihaveissues,1d3uly,I (20F) am in a wonderful relationship with my 22 BF of 10 months. I think my family history has caused relationship anxiety in me. Need perspective.,Rose_iso,6,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1d3uly/i_20f_am_in_a_wonderful_relationship_with_my_22/,"I want to premise the story with some relevant details of my history. Sorry it's kinda long and complicated. My parents divorced when I was 6 and it wasn't until I started dating late in my life that I realized I had some fear of 'abandonment' issues. Not only was I incredibly fearful of rejection (didn't dare date until college) but once I found myself in relationships, *it was a constant pressure to be perfect so that there wouldn't be a reason for someone to leave me*. There's also the fact that because of circumstances I lost total communication with my family for five years in a matter of one day to the next, and have had only the extremely rocky relationship with my mother for most of my life.

Everywhere I turn, left and right I see relationships going in flames, my cousin a perfect example of this. She divorced a man who had seen me grow up since I was nine and whom she'd been together with for 7 years and had just managed to difficultly conceive their first child!! I was shocked truly and it only reinforced my fear that I would end up like my mother or cousin, single with a babe in hands trying to make ends meet in a dead end career. I think it's why I've always tried really hard to do well in school and am always worrying whether or not I'm doing enough to secure my future. It's been only recent that the idea of having kids has grown on me since I found my boyfriend, but even then I wouldn't DREAM of having kids unless I knew I could single-handedly support them without my partner's help. It's like in my mind when I think of kids I think of lost dreams and aspirations and more strain on a relationship but that's another issue together. Woowho that the country's divorce rate is at 50%

Where I see all this affecting me is that I freak out whenever I feel discord in the relationship. It's like I have no previous standard for what normal relationships are like so I worry if things are going well or if my moodiness will drive him away. It becomes a challenge to be as perfect as I think I could be which for me would be: being as sweet and positive towards my boyfriend 90% of the time, being funny, making him laugh, being indispensable to him. I like being needed because to me it means that I have purpose and can contribute to the relationship. However with my boyfriend I always seem to be the one that needs to cry on his shoulder or vent about my frustrations with my mother etc. 

That's another thing. I moved in with my boyfriend after 8 months because I was literally staying more at his house than mine, I was escaping the constant bickering and invalidation I had daily through conversations with my mother, I felt like I was being held back, couldn't become the person I wanted to be under my mother's house.

 So I cut the cord and moved in and became a lot more confident of myself. I learned I'm an awesome cook, have advanced in my career and have put into place the foundation for a good acceptance into grad school (letters of recommendation/volunteer work) and have become in overall more independent and self assured. My wonderful boyfriend has always held out his hand in case I ever needed it but trusted me to succeed. I do have one major stumbling block and that is that I don't drive. Never learned and never was taught. Yes I'm almost 21 and that really really puts a downer on me. Old enough to drink but don't worry about driving because I can't anyway -_- irony? 

My relationship with my BF has been an intense and extremely honest one. We talk about everything and do not let things fester. We always make sure we're on the same page, love the same things, share the same views on religion/life, have the same goals etc, have talked about how we would handle money, no issues on fidelity, we are really devoted etc. He says I make him whole and extremely happy. He tries to make me happy. We make each other laugh a lot, can spend tons of time together and not become tired. We have dreams of getting married in 3-4 years once our careers have stabilized. **Seems perfect and yet this feeling I have that something will happen and the other shoe will drop. Whether we will grow tired of each other or if we will grow apart and on and on. It seems impossible for me to relax into the relationship sometimes. I question my happiness**. Ugh. 

He's very understanding and knows that my heart is in the right place but my mind likes to torture me. Says not to worry or things could become a self-fulling prophecy and that from his side he will never let go of me, that he wants us to be together til the end. But my mind keeps saying that it's really rare that my relationship will be one of the few outliers to make it til old age and whatnot :/ help me reddit to get rid of this ridiculous thinking and that yes dreams sometimes do come true.

Walked her back to her dorm in the morning, shared an awkward hug, didn't exchange numbers or anything. Actually, I'm pretty sure we barely remembered each other's names--figured that it was a one night stand.

I ran into her at a restaurant some months later working the cash register. I tensed up like a bitch, ordered my food, nervously avoided eye contact, and pretended like I didn't know her at all. The embarrassment from that night just made me freeze up. Fuck. Asshole move I know.

I no longer live on campus, transferred to a different nearby school, and am now commuting from home and working part time, so I know that it is unlikely that I will randomly run into her again.

I cannot figure out why I suddenly want closure on this. I think it's because I recently found her on Facebook and now I feel like I should contact her out-of-the-blue and explain myself. Also, the horny side of me feels like she would be down to hook up again, since I KNOW we both had fun despite my embarrassment.

**Need some advice on why I feel like this and what I should do.

Every time I encounter some potential romantic interest I can't seem to get the words out of my fucking head. It's like there is this barrier in my mind that stops me from approaching any woman in a romantic way. I find I am surrounded by women in my university course and at my job.

I've met my girlfriend about 6 months ago through a mutual sport we share, and we're together since about 6 or 7 weeks. This is my third ""real"" relationship (previous ones lasted between 1 and 2 years), she has had many more relationships before, and, from what I understand, she has broken up most of them.

Now, we're both very sensitive, empathic people. If she is thinking about something that's bothering her, I immediately notice, and vice versa. We talk. A lot. I think it's about the only solution to this, because, for example, if I notice something is bothering her, I start guessing what it might be; the only way to solve this is to just talk about the problem.

I would consider myself a very stable person, except I have a pretty big fear of separation. She has fear of separation and fear of commitment combined: she isn't really stable, and frequently has ""bad"" moods. These bad moods can be pretty intense, in which she doubts everything, is angry at everything, often at me too. This can sometimes hurt me (depending on what's she's angry about), but she's extremely sorry afterwards. I try to brush it off.

She needs a lot of space. I give her that (I need my space too, so that's good.) I notice when she's feeling anxious, and realize she might want to be alone, I suggest for her to go home and she's thankful for that. I have no problem with all that, everyone has their own weird things, I probably am not one of the easiest persons to be with either.

But what's really hurting me is when she talks about her doubts, her fears of commitments, and what's causing that. For example, she went abroad a few times in the past (a few months each), she travels a lot, and she still wants to continue doing that. No problem. But she also was planning on leaving to new zealand for a year before september (she turns 30 then, and you cannot easily get a work permit after turning 30.) I personally drew the line with the freedom I can give her with leaving for a year, or half a year even: I would have problems with that. I don't think I could do that. She thinks our relationship could survive (""if we're meant to be and if it's really that good between us, we can pick up where we left when I return"".) But she also says that these plans are not *that* serious, it's just that she's still looking what's making her happy in her life. She's unhappy with work and under a lot of stress, and I suspect that these kind of plans kind of help her cope. She even says something along those lines too (that these plans are some weird idealistic way for her to finally find some rest in life, that she hopes she returns with a clear vision on what she wants in life, but that this will likely not be the case.) She also says she will probably be happy if she finds some less stressful work, and is always actively looking. 

Besides, she's sending extremely mixed signals (probably due to a combination of fear of commitment and fear of separation): she wanted to meet my family, she wanted me to meet her family, she was the one taking initiative updating facebook status, etc.

So she's still in search for what makes her happy in life, is afraid of commitment and giving things up for me because she has done that with boyfriends on the past and that didn't work out (so she gave up things for something that turned out shitty in the end.)

This is making me feel extremely shitty. I cried two times in the last 2 weeks, and I didn't cry for YEARS. I feel emotionally unstable at the moment. But I love her so much. And she tells me she loves me too, a lot. And has said that all these thoughts are just things that passes her mind, and the reason she tells me is because I immediately notice when she's thinking about these things.

I've said that it's likely because our relationship still needs to grow. That we both learn to trust each other's commitment. And I *do* would like to see where this relationship is going, and I would hate for it to end prematurely purely because we cannot trust each other's commitment (she's afraid I cannot deal with her ""bad moods"" and will break up because of it in the end anyway, so why bother.).

I don't know what to do anymore. This relationship is starting to feel like an addiction: I longue for the moments I'm with her, I have my highs and lows when I'm with her, but it might be destroying me if I don't find a way for myself to lose that fear of separation. 

I hope reddit has some thoughts. I want to make this work, I love her a lot, but I need a way for myself to feel less insecure about all this  (other than just sitting it out and let time find its way to convince us.)

I'm a 23 year old male, have been friends with my buddy I'll call him A (23 years old) since high school (~10 years).
He has had been with his girlfriend, I'll call her R (21 years old), for about 3 years now, and I've known her for about 2 years or so. 

At first I can't say I had any feelings for her and didn't really think of her as anything more than R, A's girlfriend. If I hung out with him I would see her from time to time, and it would be casual small talk, nothing serious. Last summer though (July '12) we went to A's cottage for a weekend, there was only a few of us, and I think it was here that R and I really got to know each other, spend time together, realized how much we had in common etc. After that weekend we started speaking a lot more, and it got to the point where we were texting each other every single day. So from roughly (July '12) to now we have been talking to each other alottt. We spoke about literally everything you can imagine, we would say good morning, talk all day (unless we had work/school) say goodnight, flirt a little, we even said we loved each other (not ""in love"" and jokingly I think). We hung out a couple times, just the 2 of us, we bought each other really nice birthday gifts, it was nice having a friendship with a girl like this, because I knew it would always be a platonic friendship and I didn't want more than that from her.

Then things started to get a little different. I knew I had been seeing her differently since that weekend, and it kept progressing. I would never ever dream of taking away my good friend's girlfriend, so I have never told either of them what I feel. For the past 5 months, I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not in love with her, that it's because I've been single for a little while and she's just an amazing girl and I'm in love with what she represents. I would never want to take away what they (R and A) have, not that she would ever throw that away, and I realistically see them getting married in the future, having kids and being with each other forever. 

Regardless, we continued talking, with her oblivious to my feelings (though I think she must have had some clue). Weird things would begin to happen though. I would get upset over stupid little things, if she took a while to respond to my messages, if she said anything regarding getting married and her future etc. I would be upset if it had been a little while since I hung out with her. I would constantly argue with her over things that didn't mean anything. All of this escalated to last Wednesday (march 13). I know she has school, and work and barely has time to see A as it is, yet I was arguing with her about not having hung out with me in a month. It kept going and going, to yesterday where she essentially told me that she wants to still be friends but she doesn't want to speak to me on a daily basis anymore, she wants me to treat her like one of my other guy friends (which wont ever happen), and I keep trying to talk to her but she's been ignoring my messages. I know my feelings and actions are the cause for all of this, and the only reason I ever argue with her, and she has made it clear that she doesn't want to ever argue with me, my last outburst was ""going too far"" and she ""can't deal with it anymore.""

Sorry for all this background, but now I'm just wondering what I do. I really like this girl, care about her, I always enjoyed talking to her on a daily basis, she's one of my best friends girlfriends and I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with him or her. I really just want things to go back to the way they used to be, I don't know if that will be possible though. Do I tell her about the feelings I had/have for her? Do I just respect her decision to not want to talk to me as much and not treat her any differently than my other friends? I don't know what to do, any help is appreciated.

**TL;DR  Have spent the last 9 months texting my friends girlfriend every single day, we have a really good friendship, got into a pointless argument, now she doesn't want me to speak to her as much anymore. I just want things to go back to the way they used to be. Trying to convince myself I'm not in love with her.

There's a lot in here, sorry if I leave out important details.

So when I was 19, my first serious girlfriend, I met on a 6 month mission trip dealing specifically with humanitarian work overseas.  It was an incredible bonding experience, and we went through some awesome situations together.  The both of us hit it  off immediately, we acted like we had been best friends for years.  Consequently, both of us fell for each other, and picked up on a relationship

After the trip, we left for our own separate countries.  She's Canadian, I'm American.  We pursued a long distance relationship, which lasted for about 8 months.  During that time, I found out that she had been hooking up with an old friend of hers in Canada, who I suppose had been in the ""friend-zone"" for a long time.  When she visited me in America, she informed me that he raped her, and when I became enraged, she completely defended him, claiming that her friend really did love and care about her.

Fast forward a couple of months, and the this girl tells me that she wants to try a relationship with her friend, because she realized that she was indeed in love with him.  They are getting married in a couple of months. 


Fast forward about a year, I meet this awesome girl that just moved into town.  She's fun, beautiful, goofy, and seems like she's really into me.  So I decided it was time to move on from my ex, and give the new girl a try.  We hit it off.  I can be myself around her, the sex is phenomenal, and her family adores me.

A couple of months down the road, I find out that she is still talking to an ex in her old hometown, who apparently wants her back now.  The girl says she doesn't love him anymore, that he doesn't understand her like I do, she loves me, blah blah blah.  And apparently this guy was verbally and emotionally abusive to her, which is why she left.  The next 6 months proceed to be an endless battle of tug of war, with her deciding which guy she wants to be with.

Who loses the fight?  You guessed it.  She packed up her bags and went back to her old town to be with this guy.  They got married 2 months ago.


Ok, so all of this being said, the last two relationships have completely wreaked havoc on me as a person and as a man.  I am absolutely terrified to meet new girls, and even the thought of having a serious relationship seems so far away for me.  I am bitter, pessimistic, and carry a misanthropic attitude with me almost all of the time.  The idea of marriage and intimacy makes me physically ill.

I am by no means perfect, I do not pretend that I deserve to have perfect things or relationships.  I understand that people make mistakes, and that they're broken and imperfect, just like me.  

But holy fuck, I have never, in my life, harmed or abused anyone I was close to.  So why do these girls leave me for guys who apparently hurt them so badly?  Is being in a healthy relationship with me really that much worse than being with a man who raped you?  I feel like a total waste, and a complete idiot.

I am so scared to invest my life into someone in a romantic way again.  Any advice or wisdom will not go unappreciated.

Also, sorry if this is in the wrong place, I wasn't quite sure where to put it.

First off, here are some background details. I'm a girl in high school and he's also in high school, but two grades above me (2.5 years of age difference). I've known him for about six years and we're really close friends now. We have a sibling-like relationship and I care about him a lot. However, I've also had a huge crush on him for about three years now. It used to be a lot worse than it is now and I currently think of him as more of an older brother than a romantic interest, BUT I still have some feelings for him that just don't seem to be going away.

On to the ""why it won't happen"" part and what I've already tried: He got a girlfriend a while back and I was pretty devastated. I had been planning on finally asking him out after a long time of crushing and I obviously waited too long. That was also when I realized that I really needed to stop crushing on him, otherwise it would just ""ruin my life"" even more. So I filled up my schedule and busied myself with other activities. I also made lists of all the things I ""hated"" about him and sort of exaggerated all of his faults to convince myself that I didn't really like him. It worked...a little bit. I don't feel the stabbing pain that I used to feel whenever he talked about his girlfriend (or whenever I talked to his girlfriend), but it still hurts every now and then.

He loves his girlfriend a lot and she feels the same way about him. I'd never do anything to break up their relationship as I care way too much about the friendship I have with him. I also generally try to not be a total asshole. I know that a common thing people say is ""avoid him/her"" but I'm looking for other solutions. We go to the same church and there are very few other high schoolers in our youth group. We're pretty much forced to talk and interact every Sunday and I value our friendship too much as well. 

TL;DR: I've had a crush on a close friend for three years now. He's a great person and pretty much like a brother to me, except for this little part of my brain that keeps treating him like a crush.

I grew up as a child with a German Shepherd, 2 Great Danes, and now currently, a Great Pyrenees.  Wrestling and playing with these dogs from a very early age (basically from when I could walk) was always highly physically interactive.  But I've always had a sort of cruel twist to the way that I play with animals, which seems to add to how funny I find it.  

The worst of it is my girlfriend's cat... the fact that her cat is irritable as all hell just makes it that much more enjoyable for me, it's like they always tell you to ignore bullies and that if you show them it bothers you they will keep doing it (don't fully understand that).  This cat's reaction to me is what I find _most_ enjoyable and funny about it... but I keep hearing that it's totally fucked up to do this...

I'll sneak up on it and grab it by the tail and pull it up about 2 feet in the air and drop it, I'll creep up on it super slowly while it watches me then flail my hands around it's head and watch it try to swipe them, if I ever do successfully pick it up in my arms I just bounce it around and listen to it growl.

My girlfriend think's it's highly sociopathic or something to be this way towards her and her roommates cat.  I actually cracked myself up many times while writing this post but I recognize that there is some sort of disconnect here, it's almost like I don't view them as living things but more as like toys or something...

I remember my dad visiting a lot when I was young. He got remarried when I was in the first grade. My stepmother then started deleting our emails and ""I'll tell him that you called"" turned into not hearing from him. 

The last time he called me on the phone, I was 15. I last saw him when I was 16. I called him for his birthday when I was 17. I got about 30 seconds of conversation in before he said that he had to go, because his kids were waiting for him.
When I turned 18 he didn't call me or anything, he just sent an email to my mom saying that child support would be stopped.

We didn't talk for the next 2 years. I still haven't seen him or spoken to him on the phone, but we've started email traffic again. 

Every time I get a message I get so happy, but I'm afraid the day he doesn't email back I'm going to be crushed again. I want to repair this relationship and not be so **angry**.

My dad is ex military (special forces for 20 years). He is shape, active, highly motivated and charismatic, and very proficient at anything he sets his mind to.  This creates a freud-esque problem when it comes to dating, because I live in a military community and I'm attracted to all of those things, so a few things happen constantly in my dating life:

* I find those qualities, and they're accompanied by the same emotional distance my Dad has.

* I find those qualities, and they're accompanied by alcoholism or past drug dependancy.

* The above two combined.

* Or, less serious, they have a raging man crush on my father for being such a BAMF, which bothers me a little.


I have never had any sort of emotional talk with my dad (ever), and wouldn't know how. In fact, last time I tried he stopped speaking to me at all, and the whole point is to keep him in my life.

I just felt that I need to talk about this.

So, last spring I realized that I had developed feelings for a girl (22) I had known for 1½-years at uni. We have been in same clubs etc., working together in a small-time 'zine, and we're both very shy. Work-related messaging starts to get a little bit more personal, I ask her if we can hang out sometime. She says yes, we go to museum etc., but she cuts it short - and I feel rejected. She nonetheless texts me saying she had great time. I text her that I did too - and we should do it again whenever she has time. She doesn't text me back, we see each other in some party before the summer and then she heads off to her birthplace for the summer. No communication during summer, I don't find any words to text her, and I decide to forget it and drown myself in work. 

After summer, we resume our work in the zine, and refreshingly I find that we seem to be able to continue as friends. Flashforward to beginning of december, when I realize, that nope, I still have feelings for her, maybe I should have just pushed harder/made my intentions clearer in the spring. So I openly flirt with her, going so far to suggest that she come over to study a topic about which she has been asking me a lot - she responds that she doesn't think it's a good idea. And I very soon find out that she's currently dating someone.

Okay, winter break, after which I thought I had finally gotten over her. And I thought that she would not want anything to do with me - which turns out to be not true, because she manages to make us do one story for the zine together. So I do my best to act professional, but nope, feelings come again. After one particularly nice party, in which she clings to me somewhat because she doesn't have that many more friends at that party, I (slightly drunk) decide to tell her that I think I'm still infatuated with her. 

She's way too nice about it, saying that ""maybe we are right people, wrong time"", and saying that she's currently in a relationship that she doesn't know if it will work out, but she is anyways invested in it. I tell her that I understand, and that I truly want our friendship to survive this - but also, because I'm drunk, I ask her whether she thinks we would have ever had a right time. She doesn't answer this really, rightly so...

So it's been a couple of weeks now. We've seen each other couple of times passing during this - she's been nice to me, not referencing my opening up in front of other people. And I really can't help but still think that what if she decides that her current relationship doesn't work out. I still fantasize about her, and I still don't really know what she's thinking or (more importantly) what she's feeling (and did she feel anything more than friendship for me ever).

I know that I should just probably get over this. But I find myself to still be slightly attached to her as an idea. As explained in the title, I've never had much luck with the womankind, and thus find myself maybe too clingy to even slightest crushes.

1360917453.0,8,self.ihaveissues,18kmwu,I [24F] always seem to have problems with friend groups/finding a friend group... advice please?,jumpedintotheriver,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/18kmwu/i_24f_always_seem_to_have_problems_with_friend/,"Hello, my first Reddit post, after reading some great advice thought I'd try it out.

I have recently graduated from University and feel like I have always struggled with having friends/a friend group and it really impacts on my enjoyment of life.

After leaving school, I stayed in the same home town and attended University there. I had previously had a really amazing group of friends (2 girls, 3 guys) who did so much fun stuff together, had sleepovers etc, but the group got torn to pieces when my best friend dumped one of the other guys and started going out with another... obviously it caused massive drama and the two guys do not speak anymore. During my first year of University, I realised I was not that close to my friend group from school anymore. Half of them had long-term relationships, and none of them were really that interested in socialising/partying/meeting new people. 

I decided to move cities, go to a different University and go to a hall of residence (a place where students live for their first years). I had an amazing year, met a great group of girls, and felt like all my grievances from the previous year had finally been resolved. The next year, when we all went flatting (a group of 3-6 share a house), it fell apart again. I assumed we'd all stay close after our experiences together, but one of our friends started disliking the rest of our group (for reasons I don't really understand, spread rumours about us) and another that we lived with started disliking my friend and I because she was quite conservative and we liked partying and having fun (not a ridiculous amount or anything). I remember crying at the time because I was so sad that there had to be so much conflict and we couldn't just all get along and have fun together.

The next year was much better and we started having a proper group. I moved into a different flat and introduced my friends to some others that I had met. They hit it off and for a while things were going really well. We went on a mini holiday together, did lots of things together. But yet again, more drama and problems. One of my best friends started dating one of my friends, and after they broke up, she started hating him and wanted everyone to reject him as a friend. As if this wasn't bad enough, a close friend I lived with got upset with me for a relatively silly reason (I was busy with exams so was never home. She went to hospital for a minor operation but I wasn't aware as I hadn't talked to her for a few weeks. When she got back, I said something flippant to her, not knowing she had had an operation and she went nuts at me. Although I apologised profusely the next day, she said she didn't want to be friends anymore and we haven't talked since). So our group completely fell apart. I had to leave the place I was living because she got her friend to verbally abuse me everytime I returned home (she had previously been a really sweet girl).

The next year, I lived with some girls I hadn't known before who were three years younger than me. Things went really well, and I was so envious of the fact that they had a HUGE group of friends from their times at the hall of residence. Everyone was friends with each other, everyone got along, and there was no cliques or bitchiness. 

After I graduated and moved back to my hometown, things really fell apart COMPLETELY. I was really positive about things working out for me, and thought everything would be ok. I tried reaching out to my old friends but they were EXACTLY the same as before, yet we were more different after I had spent so much time away. They all still had the same boyfriends since school (so since they were 15-16) and had never lived in a different city, never been out of their comfort zone etc. At work, I tried to reach out to people, but most had their own friends already, or were in intense relationships and didn't seem to really need anyone else.

I feel so alone and so sad that I don't really have any close friends. Everytime a holiday comes around I don't have plans, and there's always some reason why I can't spend it with the people I know who are dotted all over the place (they will be overseas, they will be spending it with their SO etc). All I have ever wanted was to have a small circle of friends, and I don't understand why I am the one who doesn't have one. EVERYONE I know is still close with either their group from school or University (or are so invested in their SO they don't really mind). Most of my friend groups from University have really strong bonds with their school friends (who have been through numerous breakups, live in different cities, been overseas etc... I seem to be the ONLY person with such a sheltered group of friends from school). Just the other day I saw on Facebook a group of people who I knew from University through an ex boyfriend planning a trip overseas together and I felt really down.

I don't really understand why this happens to me. I am a friendly, nice person. I like everyone I meet and am really careful not to offend people. I have never done anything really cruel to someone else eg/ slept with their boyfriend, disliked them for no particular reason. I know that people generally like me as I was voted on to our University Student Council in the face of intense competition, but sometimes I wonder whether that was accidental or something. 

I've noticed that the people I get to know personally who have lots of close friends tend to actually be quite rude and flippant at times to others, but generally bear no consequences for their actions. I've also noticed that other girls are quite cool/awkward with me. Some of the really 'popular' ones, I'll always smile and say hello to them, and they will barely say one word to me - I can't work out how they have so many friends when they don't seem friendly at all ?!?! I've also chatted to other girls who have had similar fights with friends/ fall outs with groups but 90% end up making up a few months later.

I feel so down about it, it has really affected my self-esteem and I have given up trying to make friends as I just think they are going to leave. Before, I used to have hope, but now I feel like I've been burnt so many times that I don't want to try. I'm too scared to do things I want to do (ie move overseas) as I don't want to wind up completely alone which I feel will inevitably happen. Other friends who moved overseas did so with close groups of friends. I feel so angry at the world that I keep on getting put in this situation.

I guess I'm starting to feel as though I'm the problem, and if so, what can I do about it? What am I meant to do when I don't really know what I'm doing that is causing it? Has anyone else been in a similar situation and managed to make a strong friend group later in life?

I have noticed these threads throughout my life:
1. I tend to warm quite quickly to guys and make friends with guys really easily. 
2. I have been treated really nastily by girls in the past. One of my best friends at school totally ripped off a speech I was doing to become prefect, I told her what I was doing it on and she and her friend copied it. She got made a prefect and I didn't. None of my friends said anything to her about it.
3. People have dropped me as friends over things that have nothing to do with them, and that I didn't talk to them about constantly (ie/ at one point I did something really silly and cheated on my boyfriend) yet when others do similar things, they don't get the same treatment from those people.
4. People tend to think I'm being nasty when I never am. They sometimes misconstrue what I'm saying as being mean when I'm careful to not say anything offensive. For example, if they are having a hard time and I say, ""Oh that sucks, that's horrible"" (over fb/text) they think I'm being sarcastic.
5. People tend to tease me for things (saying something silly, accidentally not doing something, the way I'm dressed) far more than they tease other people... most of the time I don't really mind though.

I got a new phone and phone plan and changed my phone number shortly after to make no contact easier for myself. He has since showed up at my home and place of work several times. He does not have my new phone number and has been showing up at my house and calling my roommate after midnight demanding either to talk to me or get my new phone number. I had tried to break it off several times in the past due to him harassing me when I needed space. None of the other times stuck. I did not give him a satisfying explanation for why I was ending things at first, but later explained that I needed to work on issues in my life and deal with them on my own, and the dramatic nature of our relationship was hindering my ability to work on problems independent from the relationship.

He seemed to agree with this at first but then tried to twist it around on me and leave things open for the future. I told him and was clear about it that I was not willing to ever give this another shot.

He has since dropped off a package full of sentimental stuff from our relationship on my doorstep at probably 3 in the morning and mailed me a postcard. I blocked him on Facebook because I didn't want him to know what events I'd be going to because he had showed up at my friend's DJ night knowing I would be there but pretending that it was a coincidence. I believed him but now it seems really fishy to me.

I left my email open to him because I have some of his stuff still and have had a hard time returning it because there is a lot of it and I do not have a car. He refuses to use email as an avenue for communication and is demanding I see him in person or talk on the phone. My roommate is seriously pissed off and wants me to get a restraining order. I do not want to be going through this and increase the level of bitterness by filing paperwork and having a hearing at court. It appears I have no choice. 


Anyone else had to file a restraining order over this kind of harassment? I know my situation is not unique and I put off ending the relationship just because I did not want to deal with a situation like this.

**UPDATE:** Many things happened since this post. Including more harassment on the part of former SO. Long story short, my request for a permanent restraining order was granted; however, I learned the weight of what this would mean for his life and I decided against it. If I would have gone through with this, he would have had this restraining order on his record while applying for future jobs *and* he would have had to do 52 weeks of domestic violence classes. He does not belong in domestic violence classes. I believe that would have been punishment as opposed to what I wanted which was him just leaving me alone. 

I asked for and was granted a temporary restraining order for one year, and my former boyfriend is required to do one year of therapy and give updates to the judge instead of attending domestic violence classes. My former boyfriend said in the past that he knew he needed to go back to therapy. He agreed to this but was practically in tears when he learned of possibly having to do domestic violence classes. If he bothers me during the duration of the TRO I can update the judge and go back to court. 

I feel that the judge was very understanding of me and my former SO- was not by any means lenient, though. This insane chapter of my life is officially over and I can move forward.

I haven't seen or heard from her in almost two years.,inthepastthrowaway,6,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/18d1jj/21m_i_miss_her_i_havent_seen_or_heard_from_her_in/,"Title pretty much explains the ""I have issues"" part. But there's some background as to why I have said issues. Here's the story:

Back in high school, when I was 17, my best friend (who, relevantly or not, is several years older; not a relationship thing at all) watched me go through a very bad relationship. She was there through a lot of tears and a lot of drama (girlfriend at the time said she was going to kill herself, etc). During this, I think she wanted me to see there was a lot better; I was afraid to end it because I was afraid there wasn't better and our stupid promises to get married stuck in my head despite the fact that deep down I knew it wasn't working. Anyway, she introduced me to her cousin (we'll call her Sidney), who is a couple years younger than me and a total sweetheart. She lived three hours away though; this was a problem because she and I found that we liked each other a lot. She came to town to visit my friend and we tried to spend time together but it didn't work too well. We continued to talk via Facebook/Skype for a while, but started to drift as we knew we couldn't be together. Her friends were also convinced that all I wanted her for was sex (not the case), so I think that put some stress on her as well. About a year or year and a half after we first met, she started dating a guy, we'll call him Jake.

Sidney and I stayed in contact every now and then for a while, and then my friend's SO was getting his master's so Sidney was coming to town for the huge surprise graduation party we threw (my friend, her SO, and some of their family are more of a family to me than my own). We were really excited to see each other as we hadn't in a couple of years at this point. When she got there and I saw her, my heart just started pounding. She has a way of making me melt. We talked and texted one another a LOT throughout the weekend, and ended up both a little tipsy and flirting very heavily with one another. She kept begging me to take her for a ride on my motorcycle (I wish I had now :( ), but we couldn't really get away for long enough due to the family. Fast forward, it's time for Sidney and her parents/siblings to go home three hours away and people are saying their goodbyes. We are still texting and tell one another we are sad we missed our chance to kiss; we had felt the tension all weekend but not acted (note: she was still dating Jake at this time). She texted me and asked me to meet her inside, and when I did we had a totally cliche moment where we stared into one another's eyes as we slowly moved in and brushed lips.

We stopped and looked at one another and moved to where we wouldn't be seen and shared a few more kisses. It should be noted that her touch and her kiss felt like nothing I had ever felt before with anyone (I had dated or hooked up with a fair number of girls since my crazy ex) and still have never experienced. I am a horribly hopeless romantic and stuff like that sticks to me; to me, that's the literal definition of a spark. Thinking about it makes my heart beat fast to this day. She also said that she felt exactly the same way about it.

We Skyped almost every night for hours for about a week afterward. We talked about what we needed to do; she wasn't particularly happy with her relationship at the time and we wanted each other. I also told her that I had been secretly sleeping with someone on and off for over a year (details aren't important as she didn't know them either; leave it at my high school relationship ended in a very fucked up manner and I made a lot of poor decisions following it that I didn't know how to get out of once I had started) We were at a point where we could have made the distance work and both wanted to. She told me, ""this scares the shit out of me, but I want it to work."" I told her I needed to kiss her again and she agreed; I drove the six-hour round trip to spend 45 minutes with her because I wanted to spend time with her so badly and be able to make her mine. We acted like a couple; held hands, kissed, and watched the sun set. It still set my skin on fire to touch her or to kiss her, so I didn't and don't see it as a fluke.

A few days later, out of nowhere, she called me. I was excited to hear her voice, but she told me, ""I don't think I can talk to you anymore. I can't risk losing Jake again."" I was in shock, and all I could say was ""o....ok...."" before she hung up the phone. I was rather heartbroken, too much so for something that had been a week, but I was. I removed her from Facebook, deleted her number (which didn't matter as I know it by heart), and removed her from Facebook. I explained to my best friend what happened some time after.

Six months ago, my friend comes to me and tells me that Sidney and Jake have broken up; he decided he couldn't see himself marrying her. I hadn't thought too much about her for a long time, but when she told me about this my thoughts came back and I wanted to call her. I decided I would give her several months and that I'd call her after my early November birthday. I was getting ready to do so when it came to my attention that they had gotten back together; they still are a couple.

Anyway, here's the thing. I miss her. It's ridiculous. I know. It's been two years and I havent seen or spoken to her, but I still miss her. I'd love to just have her friendship back. We were good friends at a point and I miss it. I think about her very often these days. How the hell do I either get over this and forget her existence or somehow talk to her and explain that I miss her friendship?

Sorry for the amount of irrelevant word vomit; I don't get to talk about this to people and it's been building up.

Addiction to infatuation, you say? The feeling you get when you're first getting to know a new person of interest. Butterflies in the stomach, if you will. Despite of being in a stable relationship, I cannot seem to be able to resist the Siren song of a new female. This happens about every month or so. I get to know a friend-of-a-friend, a stranger a the club or a new coworker and completely fall for them. For a time lasting from a few days to weeks they occupy my thoughts completely. I might even go out for coffee with them on a pretence of ""just as friends"" or just chat online. And the feelings this invokes are the best I know, beating any hobby, substance or other vice I have tried. I'm not mistaking this for pure sexual attraction. I might not escalate these crushes to the level of a sexual relationship even if I were single (although admittedly, I did in the case of my current SO).



**TL;DR and questions**

I keep having new crushes regularly despite being in a relationship (although being single probably wouldn't solve anything) and loving it.



DAE have experiences that resonate with mine? What have you done about them, if anything?

Is what I'm doing wrong? I've told my SO about this and she brushes them off as normal crushes/innocent flirting, saying that everyone gets them but I don't think she fully comprehends the importance that they play in my life… In addition, I feel bad for leading these girls on even though there's no chance of a relationship.

These are the things I'm the least concerned with right now, so I'll continue.

The roots of my issues go down to the fact that I've lost everything I have ever cared about, my digital life. It's as simple as a dumb mistake I made in the summer of 2011, when I accidentally disconnected the wrong harddrive and formatted what was left of my life from 2006 till then. I thought I could get past it, but I can't, no matter how hard I try. 

This will sound horribly pathetic to most, but for someone never having a social life, nor friends, this was my entire life. I'm a very tech savvy guy, and that probably just made me ignore the fact that I could do a mistake like this, so I never cared for frequent backups. What's even more silly, is that once I had transferred pictures from my phone to the computer, I deleted them off the phone immediately, not because of lack of storage, but because I was afraid someone else would see the pictures that weren't even personal in the first place. Yeah. 

I don't know how to express myself properly about all this, as it is just a mixture of my whole life already being bad, and then this was added, like a handful of salt in an open wound. To put it into perspective, I'd much rather have these files for one last day and then die peacefully, that's how much this has destroyed me.

I guess I'm just looking for someone that have any experience with, or know what actually works to get past things like this. It's just worsening my already horrible life, which is the last thing I need.


And a little about myself, if that's needed at this point: I'm a typical ISTP personality, which caused me to end up quitting two years of school because I couldn't deal with the social complications being thrown at me. I've always had great results in any academic matters (aside from quitting), but that hasn't helped my self-confidence or social skills the tiniest bit. I over-analyze absolutely everything around me, including myself, and I constantly 'talk' to myself (silently, of course) as a part of the analyzing thing.

I've tried seeing both doctors and psychiatrists, but once I sit in that chair, my brain decides to enable some sort of defense mechanism, so I completely block it all out, being unable to get to the actual problem of the whole situation - and it's like I can't even control it, while still being fully aware of what is happening.

1360440247.0,8,self.ihaveissues,187hca,Finding skeletons in the closets of my dysfunctional family that are really causing me to question how healthy it is to have them so involved in my life [25/f],polyintrouble,9,1,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/187hca/finding_skeletons_in_the_closets_of_my/,"Alright, this is kind of scattered and dis-jointed, so I'm sorry if it doesn't make much senses.  Please at least read the TL;DR. 

Just to put things into perspective, I have bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.  I've been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons (suicidal thoughts and gestures) 4 times since 2011.  

I've been living with my parents since November 2012 and have been in the hospital twice for issues that I've had with them.  This is more than just a pattern.  I know I’ve been enabling their behavior by not resisting but I’m scared of losing them for some reason.

I have been told by many people that my parents are extremely dysfunctional and that their behavior towards me has bordered on, if not officially classified as, emotionally and psychologically abusive.  

Since moving out of my parents' house after starting college in 2005, I've done my best to build a strong network of friends to call ""family"".  This has caused my parents to try to pull me in even harder while I push away.  My parents threatened to not pay for college if I switched my major (nursing and education were fine majors, but not psychology).  They’ve always felt the need to micro-manage everything, from my relationships with friends to where I was at every moment of every day.

They discouraged me from finishing graduate school when I was 15 credits shy of completing it (I was working FT and taking classes FT.  I was over-stressed during that semester and ended up having to drop an ""easy"" class early on.  Although they weren't paying for it, their lack of support was enough for me to never go back to classes after the semester ended. 

In high school, I was expected to have perfect grades (getting an A- brought up disappointment) but my younger brother was able to get by with C's and D's.  My parents didn't want me to hang out with friends and although I had friends in school, I wanted to see them outside of school.  They wouldn't agree to let me do extra-curricular activities during my senior year of high school because they thought it would get in the way of preparing for college.  My brother was allowed to be a three-season athlete whereas I was discouraged from playing sports.  They told me that they wouldn't help pay for college if I went out of state.  It didn’t matter where he went and he chose an in-state school anyway.

They've also been manipulative with my money (savings bonds in my name are being withheld right now because I'm unemployed).

They've refused to help me get treatment when I needed it most and it took a suicidal gesture with a plan to OD in order to get them to take me to the hospital.   My parents wouldn’t let me see my old psych nurse practitioner or therapist  because it would be out of pocket although I desperately needed help ASAP.

I was raped in college by a stranger.  My mother tried to accept guilt for not having been able to protect me from 2 hours away.  I think she still thinks that it somehow happened for a reason.

My dad [49] is explosive and extremely angry.  I've never seen him show much of anything else.  He doesn't have a drinking problem or anything but he can go from 0-60 in a heartbeat and then he can't be reasoned with.  Things always have to be done ""his way"".  There's no room for compromise.

My mother [57] is very meek and submissive.  She usually just goes along with whatever my father says.  She's intrusive and a ""helicopter"" parent.  She has this idea that she always knows what's best despite my resistance or differing ideas.  I feel like my mom's hovering is her way of trying to express love but she refuses to actually accept responsibility.  She feels it is her right to go rifling through my stuff and reading my journals.  While I was in the hospital, she tried to manipulate my treatment team.  She's also e-mailed therapists with information that she thinks I wouldn't tell or would lie about.

They tell me that they want me to be independent but they don't want to allow me out of their sight to fail at anything.  I don’t want to be coddled anymore.

I've been told over and over again that crying is unacceptable and a sign of weakness.  I feel like my feelings have always been stuffed and it’s never been encouraged for me to share what’s on my mind.

Let me also just say that my dad and brother are super-close.  I've never been close with him or either of my parents.  My parents deny this by saying that we've done superficial things like going to the zoo or out for dinner.

I recently talked with my aunt (my dad's sister) about how these issues have been affecting my life and she came out about the physical, emotional and psychologically abusive behavior my grandmother did to her.  I now know a little bit about why my dad might be the way that he is.  I do not know if my dad was abused but to my knowledge it was likely only his sisters that were abused (his sisters are all adopted).  He was out of the house by the time they were teenagers.

Since my diagnosis and hospitalizations, my grandmother has been very emotionally supportive of me.  I think, given this new knowledge, which she might be acting supportive out of guilt from what she did to her daughters.  I'm really scared by learning this new information.

I know this probably doesn't sound as bad as I'm making it out to be but it really hurts and I want out.  I know that I can't ""fix"" my parents and although they've been trying to be helpful and supportive, I can't help but remember all of the bad memories.  I feel especially undeserving of love from others.

TL;DR - I grew up with controlling parents.  My dad's mother was abusive at least to his sisters, if not him as well.  I feel damaged and broken.  My self-esteem is through the toilet.  I want out but am afraid they'll still find ways to control me even if I cut them off.

1360090550.0,6,self.ihaveissues,17y3ic,[20f] I am watching with growing horror as I mirror my parents' relationship patterns.,frideswide,7,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/17y3ic/20f_i_am_watching_with_growing_horror_as_i_mirror/,"So, I know I am only twenty. I know I need to wait, I know my time will come or whatever...but something feels wrong. And I wish somebody would just listen for once, because all those thirty-somethings out there who are still alone, were my age once, too. 

TL;DR: After several failed almost-relationships, I am beginning to notice patterns in those relationships that I end up engaging in. I am beginning to reflect on why these patterns might exist, and seeing a lot of answers in my parents, who shared a very unhappy marriage and STILL, eight years later, harbor enormous grudges against one another. I do not want to be the same as them. Some kids wanted to be doctors or actresses or cooks growing up. I wanted to be a mother. But I do not want to make my kids as miserable as my parents have made me or my brother, ever. I would like to start taking proactive steps, because this entire situation has, in the past three years, been getting decidedly WORSE, not better. I have no idea where to start. It is tough to make this into a TL;DR. You might just have to read it.

It's not that I am completely unexperienced when it comes to romantic relationships. I have endured SEVERAL almost-relationships. I say almost because it's stuff like, I have reached the point where I kiss him hello and goodbye, and held hands in public. I have reached the point where people who are acquainted with us ask me if we are in a relationship. I have reached the ""are we in a relationship or not?"" conversation on FIVE SEPARATE OCCASIONS and not a single time it has worked out. And I feel like every time that it doesn't work out, my anxiety over the issue gets worse, and I am more afraid of having these conversations, and I feel like I am becoming WORSE at them, not better, due to anxiety.

Another trend I have noticed: every one of these five times another girl has been involved, somehow, some way. Sometimes he is getting over her. Sometimes he has been seeing her on the side. Sometimes I know about her, sometimes I don't even know she even existed until months after the fact. I can't even call it two-timing because I've never been in a relationship, but I have had guys tell me that they are seeing ONLY me, and then go back on it without telling me. I'm asking people to go with me and believe that I'm not a crazy, overattatched bitch here. All five of these guys I am mentioning have led me on. 

I worry because I feel like there is something essentially wrong with me that I cannot identify. Nobody has ever given me a reason for WHY it won't work. I have asked, I have begged, I have yet to be given a specific reason for WHY it won't work. I am always left for the other girl. In 3/5 scenarios, that girl has become permanent. 

I worry because my parents' marriage was incredibly fucked up. They divorced eight years ago; they have not communicated in any way other than via email/text in about six years. Along with me, they have joint custody over my thirteen year old brother. The last time I heard them share a conversation was when they got into a screaming match. At my parent-teacher conference in eighth grade. They will not even communicate via phone.

My dad has been married three times; he cheated on my mom, and I am having growing suspicions that he cheated on my loving, wonderful, supportive, fantastic former stepmother as well. I love my dad to death, but I am slowly coming to realize that he is not the upstanding, moral individual I have always thought him to be. My former stepmom and I are INCREDIBLY similar people (when I met her, I actually balked at first and didn't like her for several months because she was TOO similar to me and I though it was creepy), now that I'm older and watching my dad date again, I can't help but notice that these women are all extremely similar to me in personality.

My dad has also always been very intent on relationships. It's tough to explain. He thinks there is something wrong with me; he finds his ladies through Match.com and has proposed that I get a Match account before. He has offered to pay for it. A common criticism to my fashion or even behavioral choices in high school was, ""This is why boys don't like you."" Verbatim. 

My mom has been married twice. Her second husband is incredibly wealthy and kind of a jerk (though very generous to my mom/brother/me); he is an alcoholic, and controlling as hell. Their house operates under the premise of maintaining his delicate comfort, which is shitty for my mom, and incredibly shitty and unfair for my brother.

Suffice to say, I have not seen very many healthy relationships in my life. I can't speak for my dad (my nana and grandpa always seemed very happy and loving; my dad's two older brothers are happily married to their high school sweethearts, so idk wtf happened to him), but my mom's father was emotionally abusive (interestingly and perhaps relevantly, I also know that my mom's maternal grandfather was, though an incredibly intelligent, talented individual, also not so good at relationships--he was married seven times). Most of what I know is that he was an asshole. My mother has done some decidedly crazy stuff (taking my door off my bedroom as punishment, for months, breaking into the house of her ex who's daughter was my classmate, getting caught by the house sitter and subsequently getting in a physical fight with that house sitter, hiring nigerians to hack my dad's email for her viewing pleasure). I love her just as much as I love my father, I mostly mention these things because da crazee does in fact run in my blood.

I worry that I am heading down a bad road. I don't want to be hurt again. I am becoming extremely afraid of guys who portray any attraction to me, because men who are attracted to me seem to be, invariably, assholes. I don't understand it, because I'm a nice, well-liked person. I was not well-liked in middle/high school, so I know what it feels like. People like me now. I'm friendly and ""known"" for always being bubbly and enthusiastic. 

As I said, I know I am only twenty. But everyone else who is still alone and wondering why, was once twenty as well. I don't know what I'm really asking for. Advice? What do I do to fix this? How can I learn to normalize my relationships? How can I learn what a healthy relationship looks like? How can I stop myself from falling into the same cycles that have been plaguing my family for, seemingly, generations? I want to have kids one day, I want them to have a father that is in their lives, and two parents that, even if divorced, can pull their shit together enough to NOT make their kids lives miserable. I have a feeling I am off track. Everyone keeps telling me to just stop worrying about it but FUCK at what point am I supposed to start worrying? When I'm pregnant and think my husband is cheating on me?

I freak out on him asking why and does he even love me or care about me. He says he loves me, he is just busy with pre deployment.

I have the nasty habit of getting involved with/falling for guys who are unavailable. Emotionally unavailable, in a relationship, in love with someone else,... I'm working on getting therapy through school and this is one of the things I want to work on, but that'll take at least another month, so I thought I'd give this a shot. Sorry for the wall of text, and for any errors, english isn't my native language.

**tl;dr: lovelife consists almost solely of unavailable manfolk. Also, cheating but not really but actually totally cheating.**

I was pretty socially awkward in highschool... There were some guys that I liked, but it didn't even get to talking, so, yeah. I was pretty inexperienced on that level.

I met my first serious crush when I was about 18 years old. He lead me on for about two years, then I just asked him what the deal was. He said he liked me, but that still wasn't over his ex (he had been single for 3 years). I'd really like to say that that was the end of it, but I didn't change my mind about him 'till he dated one of my friends, treated her like shit and dumped her for another girl. 

I can think of exactly one guy I liked that was available at the time, and it didn't work out. There was also someone that totally worshipped me, and I fucked that shit up so bad...

There have been others. Guys that were in love with somebody else, like my first boyfriend, or a fuckbudy*. Guys that were/are in a relationship. And in the ends, it's those guys that are a problem.

There've been a couple. One was a total dick, and I'm glad I realised that early on. Another one... 

He's a soulmate. We're really really close. And he has feelings for me. And he's engaged². 

So we get to the reason why I'm writing this now. 

This weekend, he came over, we drank a bit, and things escalated. Clothes stayed on, lips didn't touch, but you still can do a whole lot wrong without doing those things. Yesterday we went drinking, bar closed and we went to my place. Things almost escalated again, but I kicked him out.

I didn't kick him out because I didn't want stuff to happen. Even though I feel guilty as fuck about it, I liked what happened the time before. I kicked him out because he was saying how guilty it would make him feel. I didn't want him to go through that shit again. I can handle those feelings when I get them myself, but I don't want to make others feel that shitty. He thanked me afterwards for ""being stronger than him"". Right.

Being a good person is very important to me. It's something I take pride in. Messing with relationships is a big nono in my theoretical framework, no good can ever come of it. And I want to do the good thing, but in those moments... So now I'm also dealing with not having as much moral fiber as I thought I had³. Screw cognitive dissonance. 

So, yeah. Any advice/thoughts? On handling unavailable guys/engaged soulmate^ (I want to stay friends)? 

Thanks.
_______________________________________________________
*:I knew he had a crush on somebody else, and I wasn't that much in love with him either. For me, the most important part of the relationship was the fact that I could trust him, something I find really really difficult. We broke up after ~2 months, and it turned in a sort of FWB-thing.
The fuckbudy had a crush on a friend of mine. I wasn't in love - I don't mix casual sex and real feelings.

²: They've been together for approximately 4 years. I know him for about 3 years 11 months. He's been wining about dumping her and ""if I were single..."" for about two years.

But I need advice, because something has to change. And soon.

Here's a quick rundown of my situation:

I'm male, 23 years old. I'm single since about a year. I only had one Girlfriend in my life so far, and we were together for 4 years.

She is 22. We work together and know each other for 2 years now. She, another girl and me hang out together most of the time at work and went occasionally out, so I would say we're at least ""good friends"". And here's the most important part: She has a boyfriend since about 2 1/2 years. They broke up a few times during that time, but recently he engaged to her.

Which brings me to my dilemma. I feel terribly guilty for having those feelings for her. She seems happy with her soon-to-be husband and he's a nice guy. I don't want to hurt their relationship (and I don't think I could even if I wanted to). But I just can't keep living like I don't have those feelings for her. She's in my head way more often than I care to admit. Sometimes its so bad, I can't do anything productive all day. I've named this Phenomenon being ""Love-locked"". Pretty sure there is already another term for it, but it describes it pretty well.

I want her out of my head without losing her as a friend. I feel like I betray our friendship lately because I want more than just being friends, which just adds to my guilt. After reading some other cases, I decided today that I want to tell her very carefully and if possible in a way that does not burden her, or make it all weird to hang out afterwards. Or in short, in a way that doesn't cost us our friendship.

So...Is this even possible? Should I scrap my plan and find another way of dealing with this somehow? And if so, how? Have you ever had a friend confess his or her feelings for you? What happened afterwards? Please help me, I need to deal with this...cancerous situation before it eats me completely.

And just to be clear: I don't expect her to feel the same way, not one bit. I don't want to ruin what she has, I just want her to know what is up with me and want to stop to feel about her THAT way. I want our true friendship back. Brainsurgery maybe? X)

PS: She is a bit anti-social and doesn't have many friends due to a colorful past. I suspect that she won't know how to react if I were to confront her with my feelings. My top priority is to avoid hurting her.

So my issue now in my new relationship isn't that she has given me any reason not to trust her. I am just having a hard time dealing with breaking my bad habits of stewing over whats going on. We communicate a lot and if anything she has done a lot of reinforce my trust in her, but in certain situations I have a difficult time dealing.

Has anyone else felt this way before? Are there any constructive things I can do? I don't like to turn to my friends and bog them down with my insecurities. I am usually the glue that holds my circle of friends together and I do not show my weaknesses to them.

I've suffered from self-esteem/anxiety issues my entire life, and I'm at the point where I'm so afraid of going through the rest of my life being afraid. I want to be someone. I want to have a normal life. I want to be happy. But sometimes being happy is so damn hard for me. I've been taking antidepressants and attending therapy for a year and a half, and while they have helped immensely, there are still some ideas I have about myself I'm having a really hard time shaking. 

I have a surgical scar on my backside from when I was a baby. I had a benign tumor near my sciatic nerve, and without the surgery, I wouldn't be able to walk. The scar is a rather deep incision, and it's caused me grief about my body my entire life. I can't (or I suppose a more accurate word would be ""won't"") wear certain swimsuits, certain cuts of underwear, etc. I was teased in the locker room ALL THE TIME as a child about it. Part of me is afraid that, if I were to have a relationship with a man and he saw it, he'd get repulsed and leave. I dress very modestly, to the point where I've been called a prude, and I hate it, because I'm not at all. I'm just as much a sexual being as any other person. 

I feel guilty for wanting things. For instance, my family asked what I wanted for my birthday, and I asked them to give what they would have spent on me to charity. I feel like there are so many people who have nothing, and it just doesn't seem fair to me that I'd get some cool gadget when someone somewhere else doesn't know where their next meal is coming from. My parents said they'd give a bit to Make-A-Wish, but that I deserve something, and while the rational part of me would agree with them, I still feel guilty. I actually cried when my sister asked me what I wanted for Christmas. I just don't think about things I want. I KNOW it's supposed to be something fun, not something to stress out over, and I don't know why I do it. 

I'm a doormat. I've only recently grown something of a spine due to my ex (which I won't go into here), and I hate it. I don't ask for much. I try to treat everyone with respect, and all I ask is that people show me the same courtesy in return. But it rarely happens. I'd really like to think that that isn't too much to ask for, but apparently it is. I'm working with my therapist on being more assertive, but I always feel so pathetic. I'm a tiny woman. I'm very quiet. I feel like I'm not being taken seriously. 

I have a tendency of pushing people away. I'm just so afraid of being hurt, but in the end, I know I'm just hurting myself. I just don't know how to let go of the fear. 

My family and friends all think I'm too harsh on myself. I go to work and I go to school. My social life is severely limited (at least partially due to being an art student, which is a huge time suck). I obsess over everything until it's absolutely perfect. In critiques in school, I try not to take things personally, as they are meant to be helpful, but every once in a while, I just feel like I'm not good enough. I have this habit of apologizing for EVERYTHING. It's this compulsion I'm so scared I'll never be able to shake.

I was bullied a lot as a kid. In middle school, there was one incident in particular where someone created a fake Xanga account with my name (and I know who did it, but at the time had no proof), and wrote all of these horrible things about me - and people believed it. The school did NOTHING. I'm so tired of feeling helpless. 

I know this post doesn't really have a coherent chain of thoughts, but all of these things that I've struggled with for so long are just eating at me. I want to let go. I want to be able to love myself, to love others, to be loved, and to just be happy.

I've always just wrote it off, saying I have no time. I've been single for 6 or 7 years now, and I am not sure if I know how to be in a relationship, which may be why I keep writing it off. The last girlfriend I had was in high school, and it got really serious (for high school, anyway), and when it fell apart I was a little crushed. It took a long time for me to get over it, particularly because the falling out was a bit of my own fault. Since then, I've been pretty good at making up excuses or generally being terrible at interacting with girls with the intent of a romantic relationship, and thus able to 'cope' with being single. I'm happy, engaged, and enjoying my life but I can't help but get caught up once in a while with the fact that I've been single for so long. I usually get down about it for a day, then get better about it because I throw myself into work, school, or something else. I have no problems honestly being friends with girls, but I have no idea how to read signals with new people I meet, and so I usually just default to being friends. I'm also very vary of being aggressive because it just makes me uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it's because I'm actually afraid of getting into a relationship (did I mention I'm a virgin?), or if I have some principled feminist belief about this kind of stuff. I feel like I say the latter to justify or mask the former. Who knows.

So, anyway. I met this girl through work, and we've hung out a few times. I'm not sure how to handle this. I really like her. Like, a lot. She's smart, she's attractive, and we seem to get along. We've gotten wasted together a few times and just talked about so much stuff, including relationship histories and all that. I've admitted to her that I liked her, and she seems to still want to hang out, though I'm not sure if that in itself is an affirmative answer. I really like her, but I'm afraid of coming off as too desperate. We text, mostly, but only in the early mornings or late evenings because that's when we're both not working or doing something that requires our full attention. I'm afraid of texting her too often because we're both very busy and our schedules don't seem to mesh. I don't know how to overcome this with her so that we can hang out or communicate more often without, again, coming off as desperate. She recently suggested we do something together, but again scheduling seems to be an impediment.

Thanks for reading through this, this is probably my first reddit post ever, and would appreciate some help or words of wisdom.

Jane was swept away by Bill on the first night she was introduced to my friends. We would always hang out in threes but I had to work a normal job they didn't. Bill and Jane started spending a lot of time together so I figured they had begun dating / sleeping with each other. It wasn't a big deal to me, Bill was a virgin and I figured, if he finally found someone more power to him. But i'd ask him about it and he would always say ""I can't talk about it"" out of respect for Jane. and I asked Jane if they were dating and she would always reply with silence. 

Fast forward a year and a half later into our friendship and Jane is back with her ex-boyfriend ""Stan"". Stand used to date ""Amy"", she's a talker and can't hold a secret worth anything. But apparently she was trusted with the information regarding Bill and Jane that I wasn't.  

Whenever Amy is with the 4 of us who isn't over Stan by a long shot... Will do anything and everything to stick it to Stan. Often times referring to Bill getting laid and losing his virginity. What I don't understand is why are Bill and Jane not willing to let me know what happened between them? Why do I have to hear it from a loud mouthed third party in the most disrespectful way?

Alot of schools out there (mine included) are commuter universities. Derivably, this means that the bulk of the student body drives to and from school. The issues, however, don't result from the vehicles themselves, but rather arise when you navigate the walkways, and enter the classrooms. Everyone is walking by themselves, save a strong minority that is inherently attracted to body heat. 

Now I'm not saying they're losers; that they have no friends. That would be the epitome of empty-mindedness. And if I may derail, they always have their heads down (texting) so clearly they have some engagements, but I'll digress.

You enter the classroom and if it's not the first day you see that everyone sits seats apart. That's still no big deal because who doesn't like their space?

But then the class ends and the atmosphere of engagement is swept away as the breaths and colognes and body washes slowly fade, lagging behind the hurried feet of their owners.

You're slow to get up. Maybe you raise your eyebrows while having your eyelids closed so that it appears to others as if you are fatigued, and not destitute. But let's face it in the time it took you to stand up and exit the building your peers left in their cars, presumably to go be with the people they were texting. 

I know alot of other universities are different, but it seems that commuter schools such as mine have become the 'mcdonalds' of the postsecondary education world. Lacking. Relatively fast. Surprisingly high priced.

I used to believe in this big farce of adding everyone on facebook and myspace and I'll admit it was somewhat of a confidence boost having all those ""friends"" on paper. I also embraced the concept being able to engage multiple people with texting and messaging. 

But a while back I started deleting people on my facebook. I scaled back to just acquiantances. Then just people I knew. Then just people I had talked to on facebook. Then just friends. Then just good friends. I think I ended up somewhere around 26 people when I realized I didn't really care about any of them. 

So how does someone keep up with the times without social media and messaging?

Also, it's important to note that I don't believe in the flawed notion of a guy courting a woman and ""gaining her acceptance"" when there is a chance that she might not even be worthy of mine, thus having wasted my time.

[26M],yhsheepy,6,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/14pwyf/i_cant_seem_to_back_down_from_arguments_even/,"I would say usually I'm pretty calm and I can get into serious discussions without conflict. I am a PhD graduate student in a science program, so I've had my share of discussions where opinions are thrown around.


Usually I can back down on arguments with normal people before they get heated by just laughing it off and changing the subject. I try to avoid conflict in general.


However, when I am talking to some of my closer friends and my girlfriend, the situation becomes different. These people generally I actually walk to have longer discussions with, since I do genuinely care about their point of view. My two closest friends (both male) I've known them since forever, so they just acknowledge the fact that I'm ridiculously stubborn, and chances are I am just taking the devil's advocate side if I'm being ridiculously stubborn during an argument. I mean, I grew up with these guys - we call each other horrible things and we just laugh it off. Just to throw it out there, one of them jokes that I would probably defend Hitler if he was still around.


With my girlfriend (more sensitive person) though (also applicable rare cases with other people and my close buddies), when we get into more 'heated' arguments on some things - despite who is right and wrong, I still can't back down on my own argument. Generally things end up in one of three scenarios:


1) I am actually correct regarding the whatever was going on. This generally doesn't happen because when I'm right it seems like I don't argue, and things just kind of 'prove themselves', sort to speak. But if it was an argument at some point, I don't provoke them or say things along the lines of 'haha I was right'.


2) It's an opinion argument, I think I am right, the other person thinks they are right. Generally it ends in a silence, and the subject is changed. However, there's almost no chance I will give up my stance. I am stupidly stubborn, and I know it, but that's a different problem.


3) When the argument ends up where I am wrong. Hey, stuff happens, sometimes my initial stance on things are just bad, and my girlfriend and someone else can actually change my mind. Here is when the problem starts.


I have to say that this doesn't apply to things like if I said we don't have juice but we actually do, and I get corrected, but more for 'deeper' arguments. Usually it seems like we are talking about something I really never thought much about, so my stance on the matter was probably wrong to begin with. As the argument goes on I actually do think that I am in the wrong. However, there is this part of me that just refuses to 'give up the fight'. I know it sounds stupid, but suddenly the problem is personal, and I find myself trying to defend a side I don't actually believe in anymore.


To make myself sound even more dumb, I say things like:
""...I understand what you mean, but... &lt;insert dumb defense&gt;.""
and ""...I agree with you, but... ""


I seriously should just say something like ""yeah I'm I'm totally wrong, you convinced me"", but instead I find myself trying to be the bad lawyer. I feel horrible after these arguments because I know I just spent the last who knows how long arguing about something I don't actually believe in.


Google searches tell me basically I just need to learn to stop before I start taking the arguments 'personally'. I'm usually pretty good at avoiding conflict, but I can't always avoid opinion discussions, especially when the problem arises when I'm in the wrong. I learn things from these losing arguments, but I just want to change the way I handle 'losing'.

Since quite a few years ago, my friends have had their fair share of one night stands, sexual partners and girlfriends. As most young males will have in their lives. I'm not a weird guy. I'm not going to lie: I'm seen as outgoing, relatively good looking and a nice person. I have had two brief sexual relationships with girls that most would find very attractive, and while intoxicated I've got with a fair amount of girls as well as having had two one night stands. 

I'm also terrified of girls. This is one of the hardest things I can write about (it's hard to self-analyse myself coherently in my mind, let alone written down in text), but I'll try.

I'm not under-confident. Not every girl swoons at the look of me, but I've had more than one very attractive girl express some sort of interest in me. I'm not seen as a strange person; I can make emotional connections with girls easily and have many good friends who are girls. As stated earlier when my inhibitions are loosened through alcohol I have had good sex with girls I liked, that went well and only fizzled out due to separating circumstances (different universities at the end of school) or my own lack of drive.

It's so hard to put into words. I'm not sure what it is. I love spending time with girls; they fascinate me. I regularly fantasise about being in an intense, passionate, almost movie-like relationship with a girl. I have been strongly attached to - maybe even loved - girls in the past. But I can't make a move. I can't believe deep down that any girl would want to be with me in the long-term, even when I've heard mostly only positive things from the girls I've wanted. It seems like the world of relationships and sex is a world apart from mine; something I occasionally dip into, but never truly understand. I feel fear when I'm with a girl and things are getting potentially romantic - if things are going well I want to get 1000 miles away from her to know that things *could* have gone well and I can end things there to prevent myself from having to face whatever comes next.

This probably makes no sense. I can barely understand myself. None of my friends know I think this, not even my best friend. Whereas they are used to flirting with girls then following through, I have only once even come close to a relationship. Usually I inch towards romance but never let it continue, never push myself, never face the possibility of rejection, never take a leap. I feel like I'm wasting my life. I've been lucky in the past, but that's because in 19 years even the most limp, scared guys are occasionally going to have situations where girls literally ask them into bed (and then they comply, happily, but having made no move first). I have had sex with beautiful girls, but I still feel like a virgin. When do I become normal? How do I become normal?

She was my best friend and the person I loved (I hate using that term, but I cant deny it at this point), but she never appreciated me after she chose someone else over me, who ended up not being interested in her. And now since we stopped talking, she treats me like a bad ex when I see her in school (I have already graduated, but am doing a victory lap due to failing grades from a depression thanks to her). I've tried rebounding, but that only made things worse for me because it made me realize how little I cared about anybody else, and how strongly I felt about K. Now recently I met a girl who liked me, and while yes, I do like her, it just isnt the same as how I did with K. But she reminded me of me, back when I was around K. So I decided to do what K never did and give that person a chance. So when she asked me out a couple weeks ago, I decided to say yes. And she's been the best girlfriend I could have imagined, and my gf said that for the first time in her life she was happy with someone.

 The thing that is bothering me is, the feeling just doesn't seem the same. With my girlfriend, I'm happy when I'm around her, but the happiness just doesn't last when she's gone. But with K, even though she was just my friend, I always felt at least a bit happy, knowing she was there for me. I can't talk to my gf like I did with K, because my gf doesn't understand the issues I tend to have in life, and usually doesn't know the right thing to say, where K could calm me down from a panic attack no problem. When K was my friend I never felt alone, but now once my gf is gone away I end up feeling just as alone and empty as ever. So I have no idea what to do now, because K is out of my life and my gf is who I have and she is happy because of me, and I do care about her, but it just doesn't feel the same.

Also, some things that you should know about me before responding, When it comes to emotional issues, I have discovered that I am fairly fragile, I've been prone to depressions and have gone self-harming and suicidal in the past, usually when I am alone (such as the period between saying goodbye to K and meeting my gf). I tend to think far too much and usually end up hurting myself with my own thoughts, which just makes it worse. Plus I have extreme antisocial tendencies, which keeps me alone once I'm there. I do have a shrink.

So of course, whenever I actually like a guy, nothing ever happens because of my stupid issues. But this time, I really like this guy and I really want something greater to happen. I noticed him in class one day, and after a week of just saying hi, I noticed that he might have a crush on me too (this is important because we were never friends before). He's the kind of guy that is somewhat shy around girls he likes too, so a very hesitant initiator. After we had a mini 'date' one time just talking, I just suddenly started ignoring him, wishing that he would initiate, but of course, I know this is sending the wrong message. We also only have one class together, and no mutual friends. Should I tell him that I really want to get to know him better? What should I tell him so that he will know *for sure* that I like him, so that he won't feel awkward about initiating a hangout or just coming up to me and talking to me?

Dated a girl from 16-19, she was my first love, it was intense and perfect but she cheated on me after three years with my best friend so both those relationships had to end. They are still together. 

I went through a year of hell but I did the whole NC (obviously) and after a year of coping and sleeping around I finally felt over her. 

I then found a new girlfriend, at University, who I saw every day and had a great 6 months with. She started falling for me but got upset because I wasn't there yet, I explained that it was because of trust issues having been betrayed like I was. But, against everything I told myself to do, after a year I fell for her. We had a great 4 more months then she cheated on me with another friend. So we don't see each other anymore, not spoken to her since the day she told me and I left. 

Here's the thing, since these times I've not really been a recluse per se, I go out, I have work friends, I talk to people, but I'm just super apathetic about everyone. I literally don't have anyone in the world I care about anymore who aren't family (and most of them are dead). It's weird, I don't even really feel lonely, I just feel quite numb. I don't want to make friends because it feels like a waste of time and I can't even muster up enough energy to talk to women unless I'm trying to take them home. 

What should I do? Do I need counselling? 

EDIT:I should mention it's been nearly a year since I was cheated on for the second time.

tl;dr got cheated on, twice, don't really have the desire to form personal relationships anymore.

Hey all,

So something the therapist and I came across today was the fact that I seem to be driven entirely by a sense of responsibility to other people and not by a desire to have fun or to be happy. For some reason I seem to just really be turned off by the idea of having fun, such as going out to parties, clubs, or doing anything of recreational value that I don't see as immediately beneficial to others.

The problem is that this really screws up my relationships with others, and turns me into a complete workaholic. I avoid entering into romantic relationships with other people because I think about how I have a responsibility to the other person to make them happy and not to upset them etc. If I think there's any chance that I could upset them, then I immediately come to the conclusion that it isn't worth it.

I think this realization really came when I made a list of things to do this summer (I'm in Australia) and nowhere in the top-twenty was something that was purely for fun's sake.

We went through my past but I really have no idea where this comes from. I have depression that comes and goes, but I was looking for any ideas of whether or not anyone else has this and where it comes from. I quit my job for this reason because its just an escape into ""responsibility land"" where I don't have to think about having fun.

1351958954.0,6,self.ihaveissues,12kghj,I [24M] am fantastic at making myself miserable whenever I date people. Why do I do this and how can I stop? (Moved from r/relationships),thatoneguy88,7,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/12kghj/i_24m_am_fantastic_at_making_myself_miserable/,"Here's the scoop. I'm an outgoing, friendly, intelligent, and reasonably attractive person. I have good relationships with a lot of friends, am successful in my work, have numerous fulfilling hobbies (music collecting, playing guitar, photography) and I am a generally happy person.

Relationship-wise, I am relatively inexperienced. My longest relationship lasted 6 months, and ended roughly a year ago. Long story short, I was extremely attracted to her physically and intellectually, but her personality was abrasive to mine and made me unhappy. I lost my virginity to her, she thought she loved me. I wasn't sure how I felt. I stuck with it for a while because I kept wondering if I was just being too picky and maybe the problem was with my own outlook on things, but eventually I wised up and realized it just wasn't going to work and I didn't want to hurt her. I broke things off.

I am an only child. Most people I know were surprised to learn that, because I don't exhibit a lot of the stereotypical ""only child"" personality traits. However, I do think that being raised an only child has left me intensely introspective. I am constantly thinking about myself in the frame of reference of how others perceive me and how I feel about other people.

So this brings us to the basic problem that I'm dealing with now. Every time I start to get close to someone, I overanalyze too much and just end up making myself unhappy. Common themes in my head are ""she's not going to work for me in the long term because we don't have the same interests/her sense of humor is boring/insert reason"". I know that you shouldn't date someone who obviously doesn't fit the bill for you, but I also think that I am far too picky and am obsessing over traits that might not actually make or break a relationship if I was able to not focus on them so much. It's not fair to her, and it's not fair to me. It ends up making me feel trapped by my inability to be content with someone.

I also am serially non-casual. If I go out with a girl and we start to get physical (I'm talking intro stuff like holding hands or making out), it's pretty much impossible for me to not think about the relationship all the time. I'm not quick to jump in the sack or anything, I just tend to focus on a relationship even when I'm merely dating someone. Again, not fair to anyone.

So at the end of the day, I am lonely. But whenever I have an opportunity to date someone, my stupid brain immediately jumps all over the reasons why it ""won't work"" with [insert person I'm on a date with]. If I try to override those feelings and push them down, trying to say to myself ""you're being dumb. stop"" then that usually accompanies a mild feeling of dread associated with seeing someone. Dread basically stemming from the question of ""how long until I realize this doesn't really work.""

It's also probably relevant to note that I am very good at dating. I am a good conversationalist and make people feel at ease. I am generally the one not wanting a second date, not the other way around. I don't take pride in this. I just don't want to waste people's time if I don't think it'll work out. However, I'm finding that I NEVER think it'll work out with anyone, and I just make myself anxious.

I recently went on a date with someone I asked out that I met at a party. I'm attracted to them, we had interesting conversation, and I enjoyed the date. However, I also felt like we didn't really connect on humor or lifestyle. It's probably way too early to make those kinds of judgment calls, but my scumbag brain won't let it go. I always do this to myself. I'm seeing her again this week, but it's almost like I've already defeated this relationship before it even had a chance.

I think I may do this to myself because past relationships I've had have been only so/so (never felt like I was in love, never been with someone I could spend more than a day with before needing some alone time to recharge), and after the fact I always tell myself ""next time I decide to be in a relationship with someone, I'm not going to settle just because I have a crush on them at first. I need to actually really see it going somewhere.""

Last point - many of my friends are in serious relationships with girls they spend a ton of time with. I want that, but I also can't imagine someone who I wouldn't get sick of. I get sick of people really easily.
Reddit, should I change my outlook? If so, how can I do it? I'd love to be more open, but I get anxious about relationships so easily I just feel like it would leave me hopeless and bruised, more so than just sitting here feeling sorry for myself and waiting for the right girl (who I can't even really imagine) to materialize in front of me.

Also - please don't just tell me to ""chill out"". I'm pretty sure that's what I need to do, but I have no idea how to do it.

TL;DR: I'm way too serious for my age. I focus way too much on why things won't work and let those thoughts turn all possible relationships into this feeling of dread, fearing being stuck with someone I don't like. On one hand, I don't want to ""settle"" for someone I don't really think I have a chance with. On the other hand, I'm very concerned that I'm far too picky and am letting a lot of opportunities go just because the concept of dating someone I'm not head-over-heels for gives me a stomach ache.

Whaddya think?,GolderRuler,6,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/12jtve/m20_im_a_virgin_whos_afraid_of_women_whaddya_think/,"I’m a total virgin. I've never been kissed. I've had no meaningful physical contact with a woman.

I got moved around a lot as a kid, so I became relatively anti-social. In freshman year of high school, my parents divorced, so I became pretty depressed. My self-esteem was very low. Throughout high school, every girl I tried to have a relationship ended in a “no.” 

In college, I thought I finally found a girlfriend, but it turned out she was just stringing me along. That hurt me a lot. After that, I was basically like “Fuck this,” and I've tried my hardest to totally ignore women since. 

I don’t hate women; I’m afraid of women, and terrified of being hung out to dry again. At this point, I can’t even really handle talking to women around my age. I just shut down, avoid eye contact, and run on auto-pilot. Still, it’s been working. 

I might as well mention that I’m have Bipolar II Disorder and did not receive treatment for it (or know I had it) until the start of second semester, freshman year at college. [11/5 EDIT: I have been receiving treatment for it ever since I learned I had it, and have worked with counselors to help deal with it.]

I turned twenty a month ago. I've increasingly felt unsatisfied with my life. I’m skinny but unfit. I don't know how attractive I am, nor how to present myself. I can be talkative, but only about certain subjects. I have no clue how I would go about trying to attract a woman. Even if I did, I don’t have the confidence to pull anything off. I can’t read women, either. I absolutely hate parties. 

However, I've had plenty of experience with false starts to “change my life!” That’s in large part due to being bipolar, but it’s my fault as well. It doesn't work out. I've come to understand that I grow unhappy over time while trying to improve myself, to the point where I become unwilling to keep at it and simply stop. 

Yet I remain a romantic. I’m not overly interested in sex – in fact, it’s a bit scary. Instead, I just want intimacy, I guess: holding someone who wants you to hold them, and having them hold you, too. 

I don’t want any pity. I want recognition and to hear what people think of my situation. Whenever I reach out like this, I hardly get any answers. It’s difficult to talk about these things. I feel low and pathetic when I do. Lay it on me, though. Am I weak? Do you think I’m just whining?  Lay it on me. Say something.

tl;dr: Recently turned 20. I’m lonely and cannot into girls because issues. Also, Bipolar II. What do you think of me?

Also, is this too long?

During sex I thought I was doing a good job because she would be wet and she would alway initiate it. She told me the reason why she finally is telling me is because I ""pushed her over the edge."" That night I upset her and she was already was upset because she thought she was fired from work. She said she needs a break and so I am giving it to her but I don't know how this is going to work after so many painful things have been said. I care for her but after she told me all those things that made me feel like shit I don't know if I could continue. I seen people fight like this and get back together and I don't understand how they do it. How can you be with someone that hurt you so much with silmply using their words??

Older folk tell me I'll get over it, but hardly anything has changed since the day I decided that the feeling I had for that girl was some sort of mind fuckery at my martial arts dojo. I then went and lost my-then virginity to a close friend to try and prove it to myself. Unfortunately, the feelings Never. Went. Away. And lost the friend in the process.

What the fuck can I do? I don't think I can ever feel happy with another person, and the original girl in question is out of the question. Any advice?

TL;DR thought I was in love 9 years ago, can't get over it, can't feel it for anyone else, can't move on. Also I realize I am an idiot, I realize this is my fault, but do I deserve to suffer this the rest of my life?

I never took the time to think about what i want in a partner, honestly the first time it just happened so fast, it was like poetry in its paradoxical nature. The qualities and attributes a person has, or the interactions between---are so varied and indefinite, as well as highly determinate on your personal state, which is of course always changing---why a certain type of person may not be good for you now, but perhaps later.

Sorry I digress, slightly.  I guess it's good to think about it, but in what way?  the last relationship I was in was slightly toxic.  It's so funny, I'm still heartbroken over a girl 9 years ago---which felt like some sort of drug induced magic---and now I can't even feel a god damned thing after leaving a girl that I moved half way across the country for recently.

I play lots of video games, and love playing Dungeons and Dragons Paper and Pen RPG's(Dungeon-mastering preferably).
I'm a dancer.

 I've been doing The Melbourne Shuffle for about a year and half now and have gotten quite good (not as good as I'd like to be, but I'm working on it). I also do Liquid LED glove light shows, and have gotten fairly good at that as well (girls seem to really like this stuff). 

I'm a black belt in karate, and aside from being able to potentially kill someone(no joke) I have the utmost respect for any individual person alive, and tend to put others self beings ahead of my own if at all possible. I have great friendships, but have never been good with girls(the nerd in me is to blame for that).


I'm a hardworking professional. Recently I've discovered that I'm pretty good with people. I can handle myself well under stress and can tackle a good amount of things at once (hotel jobs can do that to you I suppose).


i know how to talk to girls. I know what they want to hear. I know how to make them feel good and I feel that i would make more than an exceptional boyfriend, but theres a twist: After a recent couple of ""trip out"" experiences on LSD and Shrooms, I question reality... a lot.
I'm not ""picky"" when it comes to girls but there are a few personality traits i look for. Please don't be a slut, and please try and take me seriously. I've had success with girls but none of them ever want to take it a step further with me. The catch 22 you ask? Well based on all of the above information, it would come off as though I'm a nice respectable guy with a good head on his shoulders, who secretly questions his sanity more often than not and may be on the verge of a mental breakdown. While I am not, I can never not think about it. What if this girl reacts poorly to this information? then I just got emotionally invested for nothing but hurt, which I hate.
To make matters worse, I'm still hopelessly in love with a grade school crush, who most likely doesn't have the same feelings for me, but nonetheless still feel the same way.
So reddit, what do you think?

TL;DR Nice respectable guy, who questions sanity based on freaky trips, who can't do anything with girls anymore because he's afraid they'll react poorly and piss off before anything can actually happen.

Granted, all our serious 'dating' was when we were in high school, I'm still feeling lost. Sorry if this is not making any sense right now, it just helps to type something and get this off my chest.

For the past year and a half to two years, I haven't been happy with the relationship. I haven't been able to be myself, I've been forced to morph into someone I don't even recognize anymore. But the worst part about this situation, is that I know he's had to change as well. 

I feel like I'm entering this new part of life (graduating from uni soon) and I want to be able to enjoy every single second of it. I don't want to have any kind of commitments with ANYONE. 

We've had a lot of problems, but we try to talk through them. I've felt like his mom, his caretaker, and his one and only friend throughout the relationship. I'm the breadwinner in this relationship, I have a job that pays for rent, electricity, water, dates, gas, etc. He lives with me. I feel like it's my responsibility to get him on his feet. As though I need to be his emotional crutch while he gets his shit together in life. In the past year I've felt like his parent more than his girlfriend. I know he cares about me, but I never get to see how much.

At the same time I don't want to lose this guy. He's been my best friend, we've gotten through everything together. He's always been there for me through thick and thin. I do love him, I'm just not as in love with him as I used to be. I think that's the problem...

~~I go through periods where I love him, then I hate him, then I love him again. I don't know how to get over it. I want to be done with him, I don't want him to leave me, I want him to move out, I want him to stay. Can you tell I'm indecisive??~~ I hate him.

Here's the kicker, I went out a few days ago and met this guy. I knew I wasn't 'supposed to' but, I gave him my number. We've been sending each other text messages. I'm set to go out to dinner with him this week. 

I'm scared, please help me.

So, my request of those reading this, could you provide any suggestions for me? Is there anyone out there that has been feeling this way? Feeling trapped/lost? 

TL;DR. LTR of 5 years, getting the urge to 'cheat', need advice or help.


Update: For those interested, I did break up with my boyfriend as soon as I could (before my date). He did however act like an immature asshole and took my dog while I was gone.

Then, he got more and more distant. I think it coincided with when I found out I was staying here for a long time (3 years). Or maybe it was something else, I honestly dont know. Then he got disrespectful, and just as I was actually considering finishing it, he ended it.

It just really bothers me that I started getting attached to someone after only a few weeks. What does that say about me and my personality, do you know what I mean? While it wasn`t love or anything serious, I do have an emotional attachment now, and actually feel sad its over. And, if in the future, should I try not to get attached to people so fast, and be more cold and distant in the beginning?

To be clear, at no point were we in a relationship, I made it really obvious I wanted both of us to see other people, so on. But what is a good level of distance to keep when hooking up and dating in the first month or so?

[31f]",auntcrazy,8,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/xp77e/im_afraid_of_becoming_my_loser_aunt_31f/,"Backstory: my dad's younger sister/youngest sibling never left the nest. She lived in her parents' home until both of my grandparents died. She never had a boyfriend or many friends at all. She had a job she didn't like and a dog, astronomical credit card debt and a hoarding problem. My entire family, though they loved her and would never admit this, definitely thought she was a loser. She died a few years back, pretty young, at 48. I was in a very remote area of the world at the time and couldn't get home for the funeral, but my brother said it was the saddest funeral he had ever been to. Most of the ""mourners"" there were friends of my parents and my dad's other siblings, as she had no one in her life.

When I was a little girl, my mother and my mother's mother would warn me not to turn out like my aunt. ""You should get some exercise, you don't want to be fat like Aunt."" ""You should see if your friends want to hang out; you don't want to be lonely like Aunt.""

I really internalized this admonition to not become like her. And from a logical point of view, I really haven't. I have a separate and full life apart from my family, plenty of friends and friendly acquaintances, I've had several romantic relationships and I've done a lot of traveling. I have lots of interests and hobbies, and I had a career I was passionate about, and left it to pursue something else I am passionate about.

Recently, I confessed to my mother these thoughts about ending up like my Aunt, and she gave me a long list of ways I was different from my aunt. My mom really couldn't believe I even had these thoughts, which pissed me off, *because she and her mother put them in my head starting when I was 4 or 5 years old.* 

Still, every time I have a set back, I feel like I am doomed to repeat my aunt's life. Recent setback: dumped. I'm 31 and single. I don't have a fantastic income (I make ends meet OK, but I'm not saving for retirement). I worry constantly about being Forever Alone and that worry has sabotaged more than one relationship by making me clingy.   I feel hopeless, like I am fighting my true destiny to be Just Like My Aunt. I also look like her, so it kind of sucks seeing her every time I look in the mirror.

I just am at a complete loss as to what to do about it. Sometimes the hopelessness is so overwhelming I just want to give in, move back home with my parents and work a shit job I hate and shop all of the time. Why fight against it if it's going to happen anyway?

So, basically, I am wondering what I can possibly do for this? What IS this? I have no idea why I even have these thoughts; they sound insane. And despite admonitions not to turn out like her, my family has always encouraged and praised me from the time I was a child until now for being independent and brave to try really different things. I would love to do some self-help to get past these feelings, but is this so unusual or pathological that I should seek professional help?

What do I do?,KuJdg,6,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/xk4j9/i_have_some_serious_issues_regarding_having_sex/,"I want a girl who has similar experience to me so we can experience things together for the first time. I keep dating women looking for this girl. Not necessarily the one, not a girl that's perfect for me..that I will marry or be in an LTR for years....but a girl.... A girl I have fun with when we're together. A playful girl down to earth girl that doesn't take herself too seriously. 

I'm 21 and I'm looking for a girl who shares my experience level that I actually like, a girl I connect with, who I could share my first experiences with I am having extreme difficulty finding a girl like this. Note though, I don't have any particular physical traits or list, I just want a girl I connect with. Chemistry is the most important thing for me. I just never feel like it's there.

I grew up with a really good attractive personality but was placed in a bad environment and picked on during my life, to compound this I was sheltered and grew up in a conservative family so it took me a while to learn the ropes. 

I grew up, I improved a lot and found that I was really good with women. I got several women offering casual hook ups but I turned them down simply because I didn't feel we really connected or had chemistry. it was casual sex for one but a memory I'll hold on forever. 

At the same time I'm not sure how much chemistry I have to have for me to finally go, ""Ok..I like her"". Like where is the line drawn. I have no problem with casual sex this but I am not at that level of experience yet. I'm looking for a girl that I have actual chemistry with, that shares my experience, and one I can connect with. Whether there's an LTR or not isn't an issue for me, I'm open to anything.

I also have some huge anxieties about my virginity, telling the girl, having to discuss it, or even her reaction. I always want to talk about sex, past relationships, etc but I'm never able to because I have no background so I avoid these topics altogether.

 I've read several thread about virginity and guys on /r/askwomen and some of the replies make me feel uncomfortable in several ways. They range from negative which is unfortunate and worries me to reactions that are positive but in a disturbing uncomfortable way of, ""oh great I can train him to my liking to do what i want"" or, ""I'll be the one to take his innocence and ruin his purity...he's like a little kid now"", or the whole, ""Aww it's adorable and cute"". All these reactions make me feel embarrassed, emasculated, and turned off. I am not pet to train. I am not a cute puppy. I don't want to be treated differently. I avoid sleeping with women because I am uncomfortable with these reactions, *not because I value a number.* The girl I got closest to sleeping with had an extensive history, she was everything I was looking for but she moved to europe. so please hold judgments.

This is an issue that many virgin women often have(Just switch the roles and imagine a guy saying the above about a girl..doesn't sound so nice does it?), I feel uncomfortable with the reaction. The fact that a woman would want to ""train"" me or find it sexy that she's ""taking"" something from me would make me somewhat less than enthused about doing anything with her. **I want a completely equal partner in the relationship.** I want someone who likes me for me, not because of something, and not because they're pitying me or offering me a prize that I've never had.

I'm also uncomfortable with the power dynamics in a situation like this, physically(she knows what to do, I'm blindly guessing), emotionally( she thinks I'll be attached or clingy), psychologically(she has all the power its not equal making me feel emasculated) sexually(I'm dominant but my first time I'll be in a very weak position that makes me turned off). I'm very turned off at the ""Oh my god, congratulations I am doing this for you"" sort of pity thing. Sex isn't a gift you give to someone, it's something you share with someone. *I just an EQUAL partner that doesn't treat me differently.* So I'm looking for someone with an equal experience. On top of this, due to my appearance women just naturally assume I'm experienced and want me to take the lead.

I don't have any expectations that I do not follow myself of course. I make sure to stay very clean, groomed, very well dressed, I exercise and I just love making friends. I'm very social with a really fun personality. 

I've become a serial dater, I date many women and find great success, often getting invitations to come home with them but I never find that one. I get numbers and become despondent at hopelessness of the pursuit. I've dated many women now but have avoided sex. I'm just not sure what to do. The pressure keeps mounting on me and the stigma grows..but I'm unwilling to bend...I'm not sure what to do here. I can't believe the difficulty.

I'm 22, male I moved to America from Iceland in 2004. The circumstances were horrible, something I wouldn't wish on my enemy. But because of that I've always had huge issues trusting people or letting myself get to indulged into a relationship.

I met a girl 19(we'll call her Athena) circa 2011, those circumstances were and are still weird today. I used to work at the college she was attending, as campus maintenance. At the time another girl (her friend) had discovered my POI and became overly-infatuated to the point of waiting for me after work and showing up at my residency, making up stories about us and such. Well after awhile and away from the prying eyes of the stalker me and Athena forged a relationship in secrecy. We dated for a few weeks before I broke it to the stalker girl after she pressed my boundaries a little to hard one time and she went off on me and attempted to sabotage the relationship. It put heavy strain on both of us but we pressed on regardless. We dated through the winter and onto Valentines, which is where I started faltering.

Never in my life had I ever celebrated the festivities, and I explained this to Athena. She stated she understood why I never celebrated it and we moved on. To my dismay I found out a few weeks letter via argument that she was indeed upset, I could even go as far to say devastated by the non-acknowledgement of the holiday. This on top of everything just added more strain, between the stalker, my previously damaged affections from 2004, losing my car, my job and living in an abusive home (more deets?) I took it upon myself to coerce her into a break.

Something I needed to try and get my shit together, but my presentation was all wrong (I did it over the phone...). All that did was set aflame the already combustible set of events transpiring. I tried to salvage the relationship from there, I tried to explain it wasn't intended to be the end. Her parents and younger sibling took over from there and stated she wanted nothing to do with me and I broke her heart, and after 3 days of crying and partaking of... some ill-advised decisions. Her friends talked her down to trying again and giving me a shot to explain, from there we dated a few more months before I realized I really couldn't be the man that I wanted to be for her, I couldn't be the adult and handle the situation without a job, a car or a stable environment.

So once again I took it upon myself (this time in person) to explain the situation, she agreed that this WAS the best solution and we went our separate ways as friends. A few weeks went by and some talking was done and we became a Campus Relationship (off campus just friends, but a couple while together on). We became closer this way and communicated far better then we had with the labels and pressures of the relationship appearance. Recently I had decided it was time to grow up and do something with my life, to be a better person for her...

So I enlisted with the American Army, a way to get into college, get my own place and keep a steady job with skill advancements I can't get in the civilian world. A few more months went by and I felt older feelings begin boiling to the surface, and no soon after we had a discussion about removing the intimacy both physical and non from out friendship. This was a direct blow to me, having begun falling in love again. I tried to shake the feeling but I can't, everything just hurts now. I've stopped going to my mandatory PT for pre-boot camp, telling my SSG I've been working when really I haven't had the strength to roll out of bed.

I expect to hear some nasty realizations and that's fine. I just need to know what I should do. (Sorry for such an extensive read).

In my late 20s, I  was dumped by a guy who very seriously broke my heart.  I decided that I couldn't take that sort of pain any longer, and that I would stay single for a very long time, if not forever.  I took that time to work on my own life, and to learn how to live for my own happiness.

At the beginning of this year I met and began dating a guy.  It was the first time in 3 years I was interested in someone beyond fooling around.  As the months went by, I really began to care about him a lot.  I let myself open up to him in ways I had never let myself open up to any of my previous boyfriends.  Dare I say I was falling in love with him.

A couple weeks ago, he dumped me.  Said he didn't feel the same way about me as I felt about him (even though he'd said and acted like he did).  I am mostly okay.  I am a grown-up, and I know I can be perfectly happy as a single woman.  My problem is that I really thought that for the first time in my life I'd chosen a good guy, and that I had a healthy relationship.  Now I know that for months he just let me believe that.

How can I ever trust anyone ever again?

26m and a loveless virgin (dramatic isn't it)

So, I feel guilty about finding women attractive and since guilt is a useless emotion to me right now, I need to do something about it.

I've pretty much felt this way for a while. In middle school I would pine for different girls but always felt like a weirdo about it. Then in high school I finally got my own internet connection and figured out masturbation, despite a few failed initial attempts (instead of feeling good it felt damn itchy, which is weird on reflection since my foreskin is intact).

Whenever I tried to draw on people I know or non-pornographic source for inspiration, I would feel guilty, like I'm doing some kind of wrong by them. This would destroy my attraction to any girl I was crushing on. It would feel good and when it's over, my first thought is I can never speak to that person again.

I used to masturbate at least twice a day until I met this girl, Karen. We got along incredibly well but I made sure to keep any unkeen thoughts away from her. We ended up becoming quite close, bonding over her sharing with me bits and pieces about her issues at home and cutting herself and a failed suicide attempt or two. She would constantly go back and forth between being my best friend and a delight to be around, to this girl barely clinging to life sharing all of her pain with me.

One innocent afternoon I started jabbing her in the butt with this giant medicine ball sized...ball, and it was getting me kind of worked up. Then she proposed we try making out on the couch, which was fun. Here I am making out with this girl I trust a lot and she's actually smiling about it. And some time after that, she brutally criticizes me out of nowhere, saying I should just be good enough at it to keep her from getting distracted by the TV and that it was offensive that she felt me get hard against her leg. So I didn't dare try anything like that again.

A few months later she sets me up with her unattractive friend that I went along with because I was desperate for a girlfriend, and Karen had started getting more than just emotionally abusive. I ended up kissing this girl after our first date, and made what we both thought was a witty and charming little quip. But Karen found out and ridiculed the shit out of me for it, saying when a girl gets her first kiss that it shouldn't be made fun of, it should be perfect and all this other Disney-esque bullshit. Any time I didn't treat this girl like a total princess, Karen would chew me out. All of my natural instincts were suddenly dead wrong.

I eventually got dumped, some six months and numerous awkward sexual misadventures later. I started up college the following fall and met a cute girl in my drawing class. We started dating which was great for about 2 weeks until Karen started joking that she was going to have sex with this girl before I did. She kept this up well past the point of my visible discomfort.

Then things get even weirder. My girlfriend receives a mysterious call at my house which leaves her really upset so I just held her instead of wondering how the fuck anyone knew to call her at my house instead of her cell. Then she suddenly can't see me as often. When we do see each other outside of class, we fool around though it's faster than I'm comfortable with. One night we're naked on the couch when she tries to mount me. We didn't have condoms so I diverted that. When we're all done she gets another phone call and explains to me how I'm the other guy, I asked her out when she was taking a week off from her year-long relationship with an abusive shithead whose legs I still want to break.

Apparently this control freak was snooping on the girl's AOL account when he finds a screen name he doesn't recognize: Karen's. So he starts talking to her and she basically told him what was up and gave him enough contact info to call my fucking house. Karen even pretty much told me all this and it didn't even occur to me to get furious at her, I just accepted it. She even laughed at me when I called her, upset and hurt as hell that this was all ending so quickly in such a nightmare scenario.

Not even a week later Karen announces that I should have a rebound girl and it would be one of her friends again. She was cuter this time but again my only real interest was not getting kicked in the balls again so hard that I throw up. We saw each other on weekends until we both decided nothing's going and broke it off amicably.

After that Karen would randomly get sexually aggressive with me out of nowhere, but always in situations where she had an easy out. Playing with me over my pants in the mall then asking if I want to have sex and ridiculing me for having the gall to say yes, flashing me in the car on the way to the movies then getting mad when I go to make good on my promise that I will want to touch her, coming over and announcing she wasn't wearing panties under her skirt then getting mad at me for playfully trying to call her out on it. It comprises the majority of my sexual experiences and it's all fucking shit.

This was all about 6-7 years ago. I've felt too horrible since to really pursue dating again. I had a few opportunities in college but I hated myself too much to take them up. Masturbation typically upsets my stomach even though I don't feel overwhelming guilt. I feel guilty for any eye contact I make with women. I feel some kind of awful pressure that my only 'girlfriend' in the last 7 years was a long distance thing with an asshole who kept me on the hook for 3 months because she can't get over her passion for abusive men.

I wish I could just drop all of this baggage because it's eating away at me, but I can't seem to let go and I don't know how to cope. I just want to treat someone well and be a good partner but I feel like all I deserve is someone who's going to treat me like shit. I don't know what to do, because sometimes I feel OK and I can be rational about all of it and next minute I'm a wreck and looking at my OKCupid profile is the most gut-wrenching experience.

I just want to relax and feel OK with finding women attractive to the point of keeping interest long enough to go on a date. I feel so broken and lonely and rotten.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_w6603,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/w6603/guilt_and_the_opposite_sex/,

I also had a crush on my closest male friend a while back and because of this we have since grown further apart.  In both cases i did not/have not acted on this impulse because of a fear of rejection.  My male friend (henceforward referred to as Kevin) does not know i have had anything more than platonic feelings towards him and is unaware of the true reason we are no longer anywhere near as close as we used to be.  My female friend (henceforward referred to as Anna) believes we are nothing more than platonic close friends to the best of my knowledge.  I also helped Anna initiate her most recent relationship which was with a friend of mine.  She lost her virginity with him and then I was the first person she called (crying) when he broke up with her.  Part of the reason i haven't made a move is because i don't want to ruin our friendship.

No one i know personally is aware of the above information.

I have always considered myself straight but am definitely bicurious, a fact which i have only confided in one person up until now.

I have never been in a relationship and the only physical intimacy i have ever had with anyone was 3 years ago i kissed a girl i really liked.  She was aware of my full feelings toward her and a few hours after the   (roughly 5 second) kiss she told me that she felt nothing and that we would not work as a couple.  After this my group of friends continued to hang out with both her and I, and along with the fact that theywould always taunt us for kissing she would act as if she had complete control over me due to my feelings for her. I later learned from her then best friend that she had never kissed anyone before and that she had been telling people who did not know we had kissed that i was a creep and that the only person she had kissed was a boy at camp.

Since that incident i have never let anyone i have had intimate feelings towards know that and i have an overwhelming fear of rejection and a disconnect from other people.

I have never told anyone all of this together but i needed to get it off my back.  Hopefully Reddit, you can help me resolve some of this.

I was pretty broken about this, because we were really good friends and me asking her out ruined our friendship.

So, let me start by saying that I'm a guy, who is not gay. That's something that I've experimented with, but it's not my cup of tea. I have a wonderful girlfriend, and am completely content with where I am in my relationship.

That being said, I have a friend problem. I have a few guy acquaintances/early friends who I just have trouble bonding with. I feel like I'm always looking for approval, and am less about being myself (something I do well around others) and more about trying to have them like me so we can be friends, trying to ""prove"" myself and act cool, instead of jovial and over the top, which is what I am. Aside from my male best friend, I'm pretty uncomfortable in 1v1 guy situations, or even all guy groups.

Friendships with girls are completely fine though, 1 on 1 or in groups. Which is part of the reason that I'm so distraught at my problems finding guy friends. As my relationship deepens, I don't want to have only girlfriends, because looking from the other side, I wouldn't want my SO having exclusively guy friends; it just breeds jealousy.

So I guess I'm just looking for advice, although I feel like ""just be yourself"" is going to be a large part of what I'll hear. I just needed to let this out and see if anyone had any advice for moving forward in these friendships.

    I suppose I will start by giving you all a bit of back story. I am 22(soon to be 23) and she is 22. We met in college at the end of her junior year. I, however, was only finishing up my freshmen year. 

   We spent the next year together and our relationship was put to the test by her needing to move out due to her graduating. I still had to remain in this current city to finish up school. We broke up for a few days because she didnt think long-distance would work, but she contacted soon after. She let me know that she was sorry and it was stupid of her to throw the relationship away when we were having no problems outside of this.

   Flash-foreword to now and we agree that we will see each other every weekend. Our plan is to take turns driving between cities and this would be possible due to the semi-short drive(2 hours). I visit her over this last weekend by taking a greyhound bus to her, and things seem a bit off. Her parents enforce a no touching policy and decide that I should sleep in a different room. This rule in itself isnt unusual, an their house, thier rules, but they pull this out of nowhere as they used to let us do the opposite of this. Still, I am fine with this. I spend the weekend with her and head back to my city after. 

   Later that night, we are talking on skype(as we do every night) and she is noticeably distressed. She is having a hard time finding a job after college and she begins to start questioning where I fit into her ""big picture"". Her goal is to move out of this state, but within a few years. ""ok,"" I think, ""I will be finished with school by then...no problem."" However, she then begins to start pointing out flaws within me and drops ""I just don't know if I could marry you,"" onto me. I am shocked because we hadnt really talked about marriage yet but its a bit demeaning to have your girlfriend place that upon you. I asked her question about why she thought that and I got her to admit that she liked the idea of us married but there was one gaping issue. She didn't want to say at first, because she felt terrible for thinking it, but I finally insisted that she at least let me know. She slowly informed me that she ""didnt want to feel like a giant."" 

   I was confused. Yes, I am 5'4"" and she is 5'7"" but she had never once mentioned the height difference as an issue. She went further with this with more conversation and told me that she would accept a marriage proposal right now, on the spot, if I were at least an inch taller than her. I begin to feel like shit because I have tried my hardest to treat her as best as I feel possible, and in the end, this is what matters most to her. She kicks around the idea that she isnt sure about ""us"" but decides that we are too important to each other and she will try her hardest to work on the height issue.

  This answer is bittersweet to me because she is acting like she is doing me a favor in ""looking past it,"" like I have some crippling disability.

  When I ask her about what specifically bothers her about the height difference, she says, "" I can't wear heels--which I love-- and I feel awkward when I am in public and I tower over you. You are in such good shape and I look so fat and huge next to you."" The problem seems to lie inwards, but I am still shaken up by this.  She goes on to tell me she is attracted to me sexually(we have fantastic sex), emotionally,and intellectually.Essentially, she understands that we work well together and her only reason for disliking me is both illogical and silly.

I do not know what I should do with this situation. I love this woman with every piece of me but a small(heh) part of me wonders if I should sever ties with her because I am beginning to feel like she wants a more ideal, tall, slender man. Should I continue pursuing this relationship or is she just stringing me along?

TL/DR: My girlfriend of 1 year suddenly tells me that her being 3"" taller than me is a big issue. She goes on to tell me that she would marry me on the spot if I were a bit taller. I don't know what to make of the situation as I can do nothing about my height. She, however tells me she wants us to stay together and she will try to work on her issue.

I've liked this girl (17) and I'm 17 male, and we go to school together. But I am trying to become a doctor and she is extremely into her school work as well and I don't have time to be her ""girlfriend"" but I like her to much to just leave it be. So for the past two weeks we spent five hours one night talking, 3-4 hours another night both times in person, and it seemed to be going perfectly. Then a couple days later we went to a movie and afterwards parked in a car park which was deserted and talked and stuff for over 4 hours. The first two hours was normal just friendly flirting, hugging, a little kissing. Then after talking a lot about it we came to the decision that it wouldn't work being in a relationship because of school also she's highly religious (or her parents are) and they wouldn't approve of someone outside the church. So the last half hour we kinda did a few things I'm not proud of, as in inappropriate touching and such. Then we went back to our houses. So I was in disbelief because firstly I didn't think that that would have happened then after that I didn't know what to do, so I left it for a few days to work it out in my head... 

Well lets just say that was a few days to many and she is EXTREMELY angry with me now because we didn't talk about it instantly and because she believes it is all my fault that we did those things in the car. I am going to be talking to her tomorrow and really need some advice on how to approach how sorry I am for being such a retard and dickhead....

Few other little things:
After we said we wouldn't date, I suggested (because we were already kissing and hugging and stuff) and sort of Friends with benifits sort of thing... I know stupid but well that's what I said.
And it escalated quickly from there.  

Any advice??

I'm young but I'm not naive enough to keep pursuing a social dead end beating a dead horse and hurting forever, just here to kinda vent and maybe reading this later will snap me back into a better state of mind.  But if you have any words to offer, have at it and I will appreciate it all.

In short, this woman is the very definition of my ideal woman, very much physically and even moreso personality-wise.  Think Jim and Pam from season one of The Office minus the whole engagement bullshit.  We've known each other and talked for quite a few years before we actually started hanging out one on one.  The more I think about it, I've always had a little crush on her.  Anyhow, I'd never been so content in my life with this woman actively wanting to come to my house, watching our favorite shows, chainsmoking on my balcony and some light drinking, talkin shit, listening to music, hangin out.  I was on cloud nine.

We went on a few dates and got a little closer every time, learning more and more about eachother.  I raised the stakes a little by asking what she thought about getting together ""officially"", and we both agreed that we should keep hanging out more and become legit best friends before we started ""officially"" dating.  One night she stayed over, one thing led to another and we had some incredible sex, just one night.  I think that's what fucked it all up, because from that point on, she turned back into a ""girl"" about it all, and the games started.  I devolved into a fucking simp and took her to Olive Garden, buying her shit, becoming everything I hate in men, the essential ""tryhard"".  A couple more ""just friends"" hangouts later with no sex and she revealed she didn't want a relationship with me. I asked her about when we got intimate and in so many words she said she was horny and in the right place at the right time.  I didn't blame her, I would've done the same thing.  I was hurt but I'm no stranger to rejection, shrugged it off and settled with just friends.  Yeah.. I can put that behind me, I thought.

There's no shortage of females around me, so in a haze of goddamnit I went and started dating another girl.  It was pretty casual but still meaningful.  I realize I am flawed in the way I handle shit so reactionary sometimes, but this other girl came to me, and I had to get my mind off of the woman I really wanted, so I took her up on it.  It was working out pretty nice and we were pretty great for eachother, until she said (on some unrelated shit) some really hurtful shit to me.  I ended up saying goodbye to her (because if there's one thing I don't tolerate from women I date, it's saying hurtful shit to me), and that's when I went straight back to square one.

Still having pretty strong feelings for my ideal, I was down and out having just gone through two big hits almost back-to-back.  I went right back to her, right back into the infamous ""friend zone.""  But now the more I think about it, the more we still text and talk, the more we continue flirting, the more I think about that one time we got intimate, the more we hang out either one on one or in groups with our friends, the more I know that I love this woman.

A relationship is not happening.  She is still a good friend of mine and I immensely value our friendship, as does she.  A friends with benefits situation might happen, it's what I'm currently shooting for and I could certainly settle for that until I can get my head out of the clouds (as a matter of fact, I think that blowing off that kind of steam could accelerate my ""healing"", so to speak. Thanks Marvin Gaye).  But a relationship is not happening and I accept that.  

I say I love her because I do. But I KNOW she's not my one and only.  Love takes TWO people who are in it together.  The fact that she doesn't love me back is proof enough for me that she is not the one.  I value myself far too much to keep this bullshit up for any extended amount of time and a woman who doesn't reciprocate my love is undeserving of it. It just sucks that she doesn't have the same feelings I have for her.  Does it make me weak for still feeling the way I do?  Probably.  I suppose that's why I'm writing this.  In all likelihood, I'll probably revisit this post in a month or two and laugh as I delete it.

On the plus side, this is all giving me some kick ass life experience that I can channel into my music.  Nothing produces good music more than pain.  So I take the bad with the good.  See, I feel a little better already.  Thanks for reading, if you did.

I don't even know where to start. The last year has been so intense. Well, I was in a relationship with this guy, let's call him David, but I'm leaving the country in 3 weeks. He told me he wants to break up early because ""what's the point"" and he doesn't feel stable if he has a girlfriend who is leaving soon. I feel really awful about it. And rejected. I said I wanted no contact for the next 3 weeks, which made him feel bad- but I feel even worse that he wants to stay ""friends"" or ""friends with benefits."" He said he wanted to see me, but ""not often."" What the hell. It would kill me to see him as a friend, and he doesn't even care. 

And I'm going home, and I have no idea what I'll do there. No job there. And he recently got accepted to his dream master's programme, and provided he passes an English test and gets a scholarship, he's in. Basically I feel like he's going to go on to have an awesome life and I'll just float along. 

So that's the first part. Also, I haven't been paid this month...the company I work for is going downhill, so after 25 days of no pay, we're on strike. So I feel depressed because I can't earn my own goddamn money, and at the age of 23, have to ask my parents for help- that's humiliating. And I also feel bad because I don't have a job to go to now- I really loved that job, and my coworkers, and it gave me somewhere to go for 8 hours everyday, and a purpose, and now I'm just going to be sitting at home thinking how I don't have a job or money or a boyfriend. And it feels like shit. 

My roommate, and good friend, told me yesterday, ""you seem so old. When I talk to you, I feel like you're 30. Why don't you smile more? Or laugh more?"" I pointed out that I'm 3 weeks away from leaving the country, haven't been paid, and have just broken up with my boyfriend, but I don't think she gets it. And that just makes me feel worse, because then she was like, ""well now I just feel sad."" Fuck you. I feel sad. 

So basically I just don't want to do anything. Like, I went to a movie with that my roomie and her girlfriend yesterday, and it was ok, but I still felt terrible. And today I'm going to meet a friend- again, just to get out and do something, but I just feel like shit and don't know how to stop. I don't want to do anything but sleep. I don't want to eat. And I have no idea how to make myself feel better. Therapy isn't an option, I don't have the money. I do exercise when I can- but now, there's torrential rain outside, so I can't exactly go jogging. I'm resigned to pushups and crunches in my room. 

Tell me something. Anything. I just need to feel better. ",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_u62q8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/u62q8/trying_to_hold_it_together_after_break_up_and/,

I realized today while reading another post that one of the many things that contributed to the breakup was some issues I had with my brother.

My brother is a few years older than me, and has a learning disorder because of a rare chromosomal disorder (XXXY).

I, being the younger, smarter, and generally meaner individual would spend my childhood and most of my teenage years making him feel like shit, a lot.

My mother psychologically abused me when I was about 8, and she got my brother a bit too, but I got the brunt of it. I was a bully in middle school, and I hated high school. I go to therapy now, and it helps a lot.

But the reality is, I didn't know how to deal with my brother, and I used a lot of my pent up anger and frustration to make him feel like shit. He had threatened suicide and I would tell him he didn't have the guts, or that nobody would miss him. I really was doing terrible things, and I didn't even really know it, because I was still so hurt inside.

Last year, he threatened to commit suicide for real, and named me as one of the main reasons he felt the way he did, even though I was at college most of the year. He was being neglected by my entire family, he is addicted/dependent on cigarettes and weed, and he had stolen money from some family members. His life was taking a downward spiral, partly because of the traumatic childhood, and partly because he was being held to a higher standard than he was capable, and partly because his own family turned their backs on him, even his little brother. Like me, he felt like he couldn't trust anyone, unlike me he doesn't have the capabilities to fix it himself.

I have since made every effort possible to make him feel better, and he is working now, has an aid, and is generally doing a lot better. Our relationship has improved greatly, I love my brother a lot and if anything happened to him I don't know what I'd do.

This transition affected my relationship with my girlfriend greatly. For one, instead of talking about my feelings, I started smoking more and being more withdrawn. I didn't know how to deal with the reality that I had hurt my brother, and i think this made me more aggressive, less forgiving, and generally a worse boyfriend than I had been before. I was dealing with the reality that my brother wasn't to blame for his issues, and all of a sudden I couldn't get over the idea that everyone who wasn't learning disabled, including my girlfriend, was fully to blame for all their problems. I was really, really critical of her, and started a lot of arguments, just like I used to with my brother.

My brother said to me the other day that when I used to yell at him, I had the same eyes as my mother.

I know what he meant now, it's because I am way too dependent on weed, and I needed to go to therapy, because I would act bipolar if I was under a lot of stress, and I didn't know how to handle it. This happened a few times with my girlfriend, and I scared her a lot.

Unfortunately, she didn't love me enough to want to fix our relationship and she broke up with me, and I don't blame her, she contributed to a lot of my stress also, and it was generally a dysfunctional relationship. I guess I just realized today that when my brother threatened suicide it turned my life upside down, and I didn't know how to deal with it, so I smoked more and argued with my girlfriend more.

Had we been more experienced or mature, I'm sure we could have dealt with it better. At least now I'm on the road to recovery, I go to a therapist a lot, and I've made huge steps to improve my life and help deal with stress.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_u3l43,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/u3l43/i_just_had_a_shocking_realization_today_and_i/,

I don't get it. Every girl I date (officially, unofficially, wtf, fling, etc) always ends with the same punchline: I'm the one who falls for them, for whatever reason, they don't feel the same way, and then things degrade to the point of hatred/pain/blame/anger until we stop talking.

I'm 20, male, and in college. To this point in my life, I've had two serious relationships, though I would consider myself to have fallen in love with three different girls. Let me explain a little.

The first time I fell in love, I was 16, and dating a girl a year younger than me. After a typical summer romance, school resumed with me joining our school's Senate, mostly to try to and get closer to her (she was already in it). I had spent the majority of high school career to that point shit-talking Senate, and my friends were disgusted with me when they found out I joined. After a long, violent, drawn out meltdown between them and I, they called me a sell out and exiled me from their group. At first I wasn't too upset because I figured I could trade old friends for new ones in Senate, but as time went on, I began to understand the pettiness that my new peers operated with, and was unable to connect with them. In the end, all I really had was the girl, and I became extremely dependent on her, too emotional, out of control, and just.....stupid. Things ended disastrously, but I DO understand why. I made a lot of mistakes.

That relationship was over long before it ended, because we were never able to escape each other. The summer after my junior year, she left for a Caribbean cruise, where she would be entirely out of contact with me for a few weeks. So I seized the chance to break away and did, immediately finding a new relationship in an old fling from middle school. I began dating this new girl very shortly into summer, and we stayed together all the way through the rest of high school and into the summer before college. We had a pretty good run, fights here and there, but overall it was wonderful. In the end, however, she became increasingly negative, self-conscious, and inconsolable, and we decided to part ways in the middle of the summer we graduated (this coming after I turned down several scholarships to go to a state school to be with her). Once I arrived at college, I sought her out to see if things could be rekindled, only to be met with disastrous results once again. To this day, we haven't spoken in nearly two years.

Most recently, I fell for yet another high school crush when we randomly began talking over facebook. I tried to use my mistakes from past relationships as a road map to success with this new girl, and most importantly, I knew going in to it that I'm prone to move at a fast pace and fall for someone quickly. And despite trying to pace myself, I still fell for her in a fairly rapid (3ish months?) frame of time, during which she didn't. When it all finally came out, we tried to continue things on a day-to-day basis to see if he would come around. She didn't, and upon hearing this, I explained that I couldn't be friends with someone I was in love with and didn't feel the same way about me. After yet another disastrous fight, we stopped talking.

And that's really it for my relationships, excluding flings that never developed for me and random hookups. I don't understand it. I go out of my way to treat whoever I'm chasing with the utmost sincerity, kindness, and all around genuine character. I'm not an asshole, I'm always myself, which is a sarcastic, gentlemanly, hopeless romantic. And I don't pressure the girl to feel anything for me. But they never do anyways.

TL;DR: I fall in love with girls and they never fall for me in return. I've made mistakes that I always avoid the next time around, yet despite how much I better myself each time, I always end up in the same situation. What is wrong with me?

Help?,toodamninsecure,6,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/tvwum/trust_issues_im_insecure_and_constantly_need/,"Reposted from /r/relationships. I have a problem. I'm a F dating M, mid-20's, together 3 years. Live together.

I am having trouble trusting my boyfriend. Today I almost snooped through his contacts. That was super shitty of me. I stopped myself before I did or saw anything. It's completely wrong of me and I feel awful for even trying, so here I am.

I wanted to look for evidence that he is talking to a female friend of his behind my back. He had phased out contact with her a few months ago, but I noticed just recently he still has her on one social network. I got really paranoid because he uses it to chat with people. I wanted to know if he was still talking to her. This was stupid, because even if she is in his contacts it doesn't mean they still talk. Why do I keep assuming the worst?

Some backstory about this ""friend"" of his: She has clearly always had feelings for him, but I have never met her. She hates me just because I am my boyfriend's girlfriend. My boyfriend phased out contact with her because I couldn't take him talking with her anymore and broke up with him over keeping this ""friend"" who hates me. He wanted me back, and I told him I cannot deal with this girl anymore and refuse to, so if he wants me back he has to cut off contact with her. I am just so tired of her being a constant stress in my life as she keeps trying to butt her way into his. He agreed to that and here we are.

**Here are the points I'm thinking about:**

* **1: I logically understand I should not have to snoop even if something is wrong.** Relationships need trust, but I do not even understand how to build trust in this situation.

* 2: We had a very rocky patch in our relationship two years ago. During this time, he messed around with another girl. This obviously feeds into my insecurities. After we got back together, he really showed me over a long stretch of time he does want to make this work, but **sometimes if he doesn't handle something the way I would, I think it means he doesn't care enough to consider my feelings or that he is hiding something even if he is not.**

* 3: I am insecure when it comes to feeling loved. I need a pretty constant amount of affection and assurance or I start to get really sad or paranoid. I have always been like this in relationships. **I am very high-maintenance and have always been this way. I've only recognized it to be a bad thing with my current boyfriend because the guys I dated in the past let me walk all over them.** My boyfriend does not which is a big part of why I am attracted to him, but it also leads me to feeling rejected at times.

* 4: **I grew up in a very stable and loving home, so I don't understand my insecurity.** My family is not physically affectionate, but we always spent a lot of time together and can talk about everything. My parents showed me love is stable. Their marriage is so strong and I hope to have that with my boyfriend one day. I know that it drives my boyfriend away when I get clingy or paranoid. I don't know how to talk to him about these things because it just feels like I'm beating a dead horse and digging up old issues. :\

**TL;DR: I am insecure and don't fully trust my boyfriend. Almost snooped to try and find evidence of him talking with a ""friend"" who likes him, but stopped myself. No actions from him to justify it, only my own bad thoughts. Grew up in a secure, loving home; don't know why I am so paranoid in relationships (not just this one) about whether or not my boyfriend loves me.**

At the time he was extremely anxious and almost accusatory towards me, thinking that I'd cheated on him, that I gave him this terrible STD and that he couldn't trust me. I was very reactive and did feel like he was accusing me, which he 'claimed' he wasn't. I explained to him I'd had an abnormal pelvic exam over 7 years ago after being sexually assaulted (that's a whole other story contributing to my depressive/anxious tendencies) and figured that my body had cleared the virus since then and didn't think he'd be vulnerable to the virus. 

I have no apparent symptoms of genital warts as well, so I suppose the HPV is just hanging around dormant but still transmissible. Anyways, he got the proper information about what HPV is and how common it is and he got the warts frozen off as well. To appease him, I went and got tested for everything and came out clean. The whole situation was really frustrating for both of us and I thought we'd gotten past it in the last month. But just today he texts me ""I'm at the doctor's again, getting stuff removed. I hate this."" 

I can't figure out if I'm just being reactive and letting my own anxiety get the best of me, but I *feel* like I'm being told ""I hate *you for doing this to me*"". 
Every time he has brought up this topic or his anxiety about cheating (his last few gfs all cheated on him), I consider just running away from the relationship because I don't know how to feel less at fault for this situation.

My past relationship was nightmarish. Of course there were beautiful aspects to it, but ultimately it made me unhappy and it took me a long time to realize (1.5 years) that I just wasn't satisfied emotionally. My boyfriend often treated me with little respect, referring to me as his ""bitch"" or ""woman"" in front of his family and friends. He would rarely talk to me about the elements of our relationship that upset him -- if I did something to anger him, he'd remain quiet about it and would often deal with his spousal frustrations by hitting up other women on facebook or shooting girls he was just ""friendly"" with flirty text messages. I was there for him unconditionally -- when he was sick, depressed, whatever -- but he could never return the favor. I often felt like I was a burden, like I was never really wanted by him, and this took a huge emotional toll on me. I disregarded, one might even say ignored, the hurtful things he did to me because I loved him so much.


Towards the end of our relationship, he couldn't decide whether he wanted to be with me or not. I was broken up with a first time and then after a month of reconciliation, he broke up with me again, claiming that he was still unsure of whether he wanted a part in our relationship. I allowed myself to be pulled back and forth by him -- he took me out to dinner on Valentine's Day (we weren't dating) and then a couple of days later threw it in my face that we weren't in a relationship and told me I should stop being so clingy and ""crazy."" After about of month of this, I somehow empowered myself to move on and began to distance myself emotionally from him and from our relationship. I am still incredibly resentful of the way he treated me.
Since then, I have seen a couple of people. I recently met someone with whom I have really hit it off. He's incredibly sweet and intelligent (almost unsettlingly so), and is so much the opposite of everything my ex-boyfriend was (and is). Everything about our interactions points to the fact that this new guy likes me (I mean, he even told me point blank that he did) -- we've been on dates, had great conversations, he wanted to hold my hand at breakfast the other morning.. But part of me is so emotionally damaged from my past relationship that I keep waiting for this new guy to turn on me, so to speak.


If I don't hear from him one day, or if our conversation is a little shorter than usual, I immediately think, ""Oh, he must have changed his mind about things."" I know that this is completely irrational. He's only ever been kind to me and has only ever indicated to me that he's interested in and respects me, but I still feel so much unwarranted anxiety about the situation. I constantly question his interest in me and, moreover, I constantly doubt that his actions are sincere (even though I'm sure they are). The point is.. I think my past relationship really fucked up my confidence and, more importantly, my ability to trust people. I gave my everything to someone and he completely crushed me. I'm scared of having this happen to me again.


Can anyone offer some advice on how to let go of this emotional baggage? Not just for the sake of this current situation I'm in with this great guy, but for all of my potential future relationships. I'm a great girl. I'm attractive, intelligent, super caring, and generous, but I'm worried that everything I've gone through will compromise any relationships I try to develop in the future. I have zero self-confidence. How can I start to get it back? How can I learn to trust others again?


Any advice is appreciated.

However, I go home every other weekend because I can't stand where I am (dislike the small, rural town environment compared to my large population center of a hometown). While there are a handful of (admittedly suitable) graduate school options in or close to my hometown, I know I need to expand my geographic horizons to find the best possible program. And since grad school is competitive in this day and age, I can't bank on getting into those close-by programs.


The other side of this issue is that I feel abnormal because I'm not willing to get up and go without a second thought as so many of my peers are. Perhaps this stems from the difficulty I have integrating and finding a place for myself in a social situation--especially a completely new one. It seems to get more difficult for me every year, even. I mean, I'm not totally a forever-alone, but I can't see the few friends that I have making an honest effort to keep in touch even if I hold up my end of the ""deal"". My SO won't follow me, which adds to my anxiety.


I also have a *very* wonderful family, and I really hate to be too far from them. I know not everyone is as lucky as I am, but I can't tell if my attachment is healthy or bordering on immaturity. 


I don't really know what I'm trying to gain from posting this. Has anyone else ever felt this way, and if so, were you able to overcome it even a bit? Are my feelings and unwillingness to leave my home and family even valid?

**1.** ***I'm still in love with somebody I shouldn't be*** 

Pretty much, I fell in love with a guy I'd been friends with for about 8 months. From the moment we met, there was chemistry. We would stay up until 5am having long conversations about nothing, would hang out every day (on days that weren't uni days, he'd drive to my place to see me), and we kept in constant contact and told each other everything. In terms of things we had in common/sense of humor/personality, we were soulmates. In the end, I fell in love with him, and it seemed he had feelings for me too. 

Suddenly, he gets busy, and I hear from him less often. I try talking to him about it, but he blows it off with 'I'm busy'. I keep pushing (as something about that answer seemed off to me - he'd never been 'too busy' before) and he then says ""I didn't expect to be able to talk to you as much as I have, but I have to focus on other things now, so please leave me alone"". I decided to give him space after that. During this time of giving him space, I noticed him talking to his ex more (on facebook) and also saw that he was playing a lot of video games in his free time. This wouldn't have bothered me at all normally (as I'm an avid gamer myself) except that he claimed he was too busy to even have a short conversation with me, yet apparently he had plenty of time for video games. I still thought ""yeah, ok, he probably just needs some downtime"" so I waited longer. For 1.5-2 months I gave him space. Saw him once during that time at his ex's party. He talked to me for about 5 minutes or so, and then left to speak to other people. This was a far cry from how he'd treated me before. I realized that his feelings for me must have changed, acknowledged that I had to get over him, and thought that the only way to do this was by cutting contact completely. I sent him a short message informing him of this, and proceeded. 

Every day, I regret this decision. I never talked to him outright about all this because neither of us like confrontation. I would try to bring up my concerns, he would gently state that he was busy, and I would think 'well, better not press the matter'. We never once fought. Never said a harsh word to each other. He would always end conversations by saying ""we should catch up some time"" but would never go beyond that. If I called him out on something, he would either ignore it or tell me that he was busy. He never tried to get to the root of any problem. And because of this, I thought he was still interested in and cared about me, even when he wasn't and didn't. This is also the reason I have found it so incredibly difficult to move on. Because we never really argued, I keep thinking ""I should have just waited it out! Maybe he would've come around and things would've been like they were"". Everyone I've spoken to has told me that this probably wouldn't happen - that his neglect and avoidance spoke for itself, but I have a hard time accepting it. I need help accepting it. I keep thinking that I overreacted and that I should've just waited it out. I mean, it's not like we made a commitment to each other. However, after 5 months of him treating me in a very caring and loving manner, I don't think it's crazy to expect him to continue to treat me in that way. I think I was right to assume that his sudden change of behavior indicated that something was wrong. However, I still blame myself constantly for 'letting him go'. Thoughts about this intrude my brain quite a bit. I live completely in my own head and mull this entire situation over constantly, even when I know I shouldn't/don't want to.

**2.** ***I fear that I will never have another chance at love.***

Yes, completely fucking dramatic and pathetic and unfounded. But it still scares me. I so rarely come across people I connect with. I've come across two in my lifetime. One is the individual I've described above, and the other was somebody from another country who broke up with me to be with somebody else *really* early in our relationship. I can't help but feel that I'm a person who is easily tossed aside. 

**3.** ***I have developed atrocious self-esteem***

The guy I have previously mentioned made me realize things I need to change about myself. He was absolutely wonderful, and good at everything he set his mind to. I'm not passionate and driven like that, and I wish I was. I am trying to force myself to be like that, but since it doesn't come naturally to me, I feel like I'm failing every day. I also can't help but think about that guy and what he is doing right now. I imagine him succeeding at things and being perfectly satisfied with his life (as I'm sure he is) and I get angry at myself for continuing to pine over him. All it does is upset me. The best revenge is living well, but I just can't seem to manage it.

Another issue is (again) dating. Back when I had self esteem, there were perfectly lovely people I said I couldn't date because I didn't feel that I 'connected' with them. These days, I think I'd take anybody I could get. I don't like this at all. I miss the days I was self-reliant and didn't need somebody to constantly validate me. I used to be all about the internal validation, and I seem to have lost that. I really need it back. 

**TL;DR** Met a guy who eventually removed himself from my life.I fear that I will never get over him or that I will never find somebody as well suited for me as he was. The whole thing has given me some serious self-esteem issues. I know these are such pathetic white girl problems, but for some reason they consume me. I want it fixed.

TLDR at bottom.,NarcoticNarcosis,8,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/szkhg/i_dont_have_issues_i_have_subscriptions_long_read/,"I hope this is the right place to put this...

I'll try to be brief: I'm 22 and male.

I came from an emotionally abusive household. Growing up, I never did anything right and was always a disappointment. I moved out to live elsewhere when I was 17.

My first (and thus far, only) serious girlfriend came along when I was 18. we met in our church. After I graduated High School, I was hellbent on enlisting. while I was working on this, she and I started to get much more physical and much more serious. Seeing as how sex before marriage was bad and evil where we came from, and we loved each other as much as 17 and 18 year holds could, we were seriously talking about getting married, and since I was already enlisting, I figured things were pretty much set.
We ended up having sex anyway, and I freaked the fuck out about pregnancy, even though the odds were next to impossible. The Physical end died down quickly after that. A few months later, I signed my papers and got.my ship date. 10 days after that, she broke.up with me.
needless to say, after 1.5 years with this girl, that I had planned on marrying and spending my life.with, I was devastated.

I shipped out to Basic Training in October that same year. I thought I could handle it, and that I was past all the crap I grew up in. But between the constant derision, my own failings, lack of support, and the complete loss of faith in the current mission of the US Military, I completely broke.
I tried to kill myself about a month in, failed, was diagnosed with BPD (not bipolar, the other BPD), and sent home.

I spent a good 18 months unemployed, and still dealing with the complete loss of everything I ever wanted from life. I had basically given up at that point; I honestly don't know how or why I managed to stay alive through it all and not blow my own head off.

last summer, I finally found work as a part time seasonal worker for my city. i enjoyed the job. Shortly after that was over, I met a girl. She wasn't looking for anything serious or exclusive, which at the time for me I didn't think would be an issue. Turned out it was. I ended up falling pretty hard for her, and things ended very quickly. Chalked it up to experience; I guess I'm not an open relationship kind of person.

Fast Forward about 9 months to early April of this year. met a girl online, met up in person. Hit it off great, ended up spending the weekend together, did everything but actual sex. got the ""lets just be friends"" bomb dropped on me after that. I cut contact and we haven't spoken since then. I've not been dealing with that too well, honestly. I've been really depressed over the last week or so since that happened. I thought I actually had a shot at something real, but then I got a nope.avi thrown at me IRL.


I guess I've said all of that to say this:

I've got a diagnosis of a personality disorder. These things don't just ""go away"". They take years of intense therapy. Meds don't really help. I don't notice a huge difference between being off and on them, aside from the fact that I sleep a little bit better on them. I can't afford treatment, the state won't take me on their socialized healthcare. 

I get very attached to relationships very quickly. I just want to feel loved, appreciated, and accepted, and I want to make others feel the same way. I don't ""need"" a relationship, but I really want one. My family and friends aren't... enough, I guess. I know my family loves me very much, but it just feels really impersonal, and my friends are scattered all over the world; there aren't really any local to me. I feel pretty isolated out here.

I'm an introvert, so I'm okay with being alone. But I'm feeling very lonely, especially as of late, and that I'm not okay with.

TLDR:

I've got a legit psych issue, and have lost a lot of hope for my future in general. I don't want to wait 10+ years to get my psych shit shorted before I start seeing anyone. I'm clingy and a bit needy, but I try to give as much as I take.

I need your advice on this topic and I hope I am posting in the relevant subreddit.

I am a 25 year old guy. I'd describe myself as good looking, confident, outgoing and overall a happy and sometimes funny guy (at least in my point of view). I don't want to sound cocky just describe myself.

I am single for 3 years now. Since then I had some affairs and one night stands. It has died off for about half a year.
After being single for a year I had been open to a new relationship.
There have been some opportunities - for example with some of those affairs or just new women.

I shut them all down. Mostly because I did not really think they were my type, speaking physically (sounds strange considering I've slept with some of those... I know).
I also found myself thinking about almost everything they said or did.
Telling myself they I could not stand that particular behaviour in a relationship.
This is my overall situation.


1.  I have met a girl at my work right now. **(first red flag for me!)**.
- She is overweight - and to be honest - that is usually not the person I'd date. (Again don't want to sound cocky but I think I have be sexually attracted to the other person) **(2nd red flag)**.
- She neither is doing any sports nor playing games. My two biggest hobbies **(3rd red flag)**
- She is almost mostly interested in soaps and other tv shows. No real interest in politics or generell things happening **(4th red flag)**
- I don't know if she is open minded **(5th red flag)**


Now for my other thoughts:

1.  There have been successfull relationships with a person at work - also I'm not bound to work there for the rest of my life. I may be that I will be in another position in the next 3 years.

- . I feel kinda attracted to her. We had some sexual talking and I could've seen myself having great sex with her.

3.+5: There have been times where she asked me about my hobbies and other times where she teased or taunted me. So I am not sure about those. I am just thinking that I need some similarities with her. And I need to have the ability to talk with her intellectually. Maybe I could, but I am not sure.

4.: I feel like that might be the point of view of a lot of women.

I am 25 years old... far from having the need to get married and have my last relationship.
So reddit pls tell me. Am I overthining way too much? Am I too picky and demanding too much?
Do I need to just try something? Do I need to let go of certain views?

Or is it correct to have that many principles and try to find the right woman which fullfills them all?

**TL;DR: Being single for 3 years. Having opportunities to get into a relationship. Shutting them all down because I think those women don't fit my way of life.
Do I need to fullfill all my standards or do I have to let go of some and just try it because life is too short?**

W,

I've been thinking about you for most of the night.  It took me about an hour to convince myself to text you but you haven't replied.  I try not to contact you often because I don't want to bother you or seem desperate.  Every fiber of my being misses you and craves some contact.  Do you remember standing during break hugging every day?  I used to be so embarrassed by the PDA but I would give anything to sink into your protective embrace one more time.

I'm sitting in my room listening to Taylor Swift.  ""Forever &amp; Always"", ""Last Kiss"", everything reminds me of you and I hate Taylor.  I push you out (or try) during most of the hours of the day so when I allow myself to sink into your memories, I'm mentally gone.  I get out the box of my memories of you from my closet and just melt.  The smells have faded but I remember them so vividly.  Chlorine.  Polo Blue, and later Usher.  Your deodorant.

""You Belong With Me"" is playing now.  I am ripped apart by your new relationship.  She tagged you in a post on FB and my stomach flipped.  I'm your girl.  Your mom is supposed to love me.  I think you deserve better, but while we can't be together I hope you're happy.  You told me we're going to end up together in the end and I hope that wasn't a fleeting idea.  Remember talking about the cruise or tropical vacation we'll randomly meet on?

More than anything, I want you to think about me as much a I think about you.  You said you did when we met for that hour, but I have a hard time believing it because you don't initiate conversations as much.  

I wish I could take everything back.  G, A, Reddit (he found a post after our break-up about him and got mad.  The other two names are some post break-up drama, he broke it off with me), anything just so I would have had a little more time with you.

That's my motto.

I would get it tattooed somewhere in Latin, but I think the permanency of it would snuff out that last flicker of hope in human relationships. That would make me inexorably depressed.

I really want to shut down my facebook right now, just because I don't think anyone would notice, and I want to stop hearing about people who don't care about me. (But I don't because I don't want to lose my pictures, my history, and the very tentative connections I have to people I cared about a long time ago.)

If I disappeared, fell off the face of the earth, 99% of my ""friends"" would never even notice.

I feel like nobody actively seeks me out. Nobody thinks ""Hey! Lets go hang out with X! He's fun!""

No. It's always me calling them to see if they want to hang out.

It just crushes me knowing that if I stopped calling, I'd never see them again. What does that say about my friends? It says that I'm alone. **I have no friends.**

*All you truly ever have is yourself.*

I learned that the hard way. No matter how strong you think your bond is with another person, no matter what the two of you have been through, no matter what history you have together, at the end of the day it's all built on sand. It can all be washed away in seconds. It ultimately means nothing.

All I want is to have a connection with someone. Something that will last. A companion. Someone who empathizes with me, and who will sacrifice for me, as I would for them. But that's a fairy tale, and I've known it for years. I don't know how long I can keep up this cycle of moving to one local, finding ""friends"", only for them to eventually not give a shit about me. I really just don't see the point in doing this to myself anymore. Fuck people.

Well anyway, i was talking to her for almost a year, always trying to build up the courage to ask her out or at least tell her i liked her, and finally, after a very long time, i did it.


I told her that i liked her and thought that she was beautiful etc. and she, to my surprise, then asked me out on a date to see how things would go. So we did, and it was kind of awkward, but i thought that eventually maybe this could go somewhere, and she was cool about the date too, said she'd had fun. 


Then afterwards i unfortunately ran out of text messages, as i was on one of those limited plans, and couldn't text her for a couple of days. Well on the fourth day that i didn't text her, i check on facebook only to see her friend posting on her wall ""I think you need to update your status ;)"" I was freaking out a little bit, not knowing what that meant, and later that day, i finally saw on facebook that she was in a relationship with some other guy all of the sudden. 

My first question about this, because this was months ago, is: Do i have a right to be mad at her for that? It seems to me that i was led on pretty badly, but i don't know if i should be mad at her for it, because we weren't ever really dating, so it wasn't really like cheating.

This whole event i went through has left me with a very large emotional scar and it makes me sad and depressed just writing all this out, and it's been months, which leads me to my next question: I want to talk to her again so that i might find some closure, should I? I really want to get over this, but it still just keeps coming back up in my mind, so i'm not sure if maybe talking to her will help me get over the problem or not. 

Some background info: I'm in highschool as a senior, but i've never had a girlfriend, kissed a girl, or anything like that, which is why i think this had such an impact on me, because of the fact that i've never experienced a real relationship before. Also, is the whole ""Not having a girlfriend ever"" weird and uncommon?

I'll give you the short version here, and then expand on it.

**TL;DR: I have problems thinking or acting emotionally with my relationship. I actively reject emotional thoughts or actions and pursue logical ones instead, and it frustrates my girlfriend.**

Now for the real version! I'll try to be brief but still give the important background.

I'm a 20-year-old man, about to hit 21. I recently passed the 6-month mark with my current girlfriend. Previously to this relationship I had one (and only one!) which lasted for just over three years. That one wasn't pretty, and has left me with significant trust and security issues.

Part of where (I suspect) my problem stems from is the fact that I listened to my emotions and not my head during the last relationship, and neither did she. Some bad decisions that have far-reaching consequences were made because they were decided with emotion, and not logic.

As a result, I find myself rejecting emotional thoughts and actions, consciously or unconsciously. My current girlfriend has an extremely hard time telling what I am thinking or feeling, because I'm apparently virtually expressionless. She also gets a little uncomfortable by my approach to some of our discussions. As an example:

My current girlfriend is bisexual. Not a problem for me. When I told her that I didn't care if she wanted to pursue intimacy with women as well, she was a bit confused. The bulletpoints of the argument go like this:

*Her: 'I can't have sex with somebody else. That would be cheating!'*

*Me: ""Having sex with a woman is different then doing so with a man. I understand and accept this. You like both. I likewise accept and understand this. It's inevitable that you'll eventually want to sleep with another girl or girls. I can either accept that now and provide a solution that prevents it from causing tension later, or we can fight over it when that time comes.'*

*Her, a bit hurt: 'So it wouldn't upset you that I was sleeping with someone else.'*

*Me: 'Of course it does. But if you want to badly enough you will anyway, regardless of how I feel about it. I might as well just let it go.'*

*Her: 'So do you expect me to tell you about it?'*

*Me: 'That's your business. It might be better if you didn't; I don't really know.'*

It boils down to this:

I've had this issue for a long time. Usually it's about people I love getting into car accidents or something.

For example, my dad travels a lot, and this week he has gone to a mine in Mexico (he's an engineer who works for an insurance company). I'm really close to my dad, and if I ever lost him I feel like my world would end. So why am I always scaring myself with these uncontrollable thoughts about his death? I even have a song picked out for his funeral. I'm worried about him getting shot or hurt in the mine, or.. really just anything bad that could happen to him.

The same goes for my boyfriend. We live an hour apart from each other, so whenever we meet up we both have a bit of a drive. I always worry that something bad will happen to him when I'm not there; his car will break down in the middle of the road or some such thing.

I rarely think of these deaths for myself anymore, though I used to quite frequently. My thoughts can get pretty gory about these scenarios too, and I'm pretty sensitive to them. I worry a lot and it's really starting to stress me out. I'm losing focus, my concentration is lacking, I'm forgetting things that I shouldn't.. 

It's kind of like the mentality that, if this is the last time I ever see this person, make sure that you tell them you love them. I think that's something my mom told me once. It's just the thought that this is the last time I could ever see someone that makes me think of the various ways in which they could die. It needs to stop.

How can I make these thoughts go away?

Although I didnt really acknowledge it at the time, I now know that my outgoing personality was fueled by the belief that I would always be able to depend on my friends.

Although I was praised for my input in class discussions, I never paid any attention to my coursework and in year 11 art design I broke a school record by managing to somehow spend the whole year doing absolutely nothing.

I flunked the majority of my exams without a care in the world expecting to live on with the same devil may care attitude once school was finished. 

I never imagined that things would change so dramatically after I was done with school, and that soon all those friends that I cared about would hang me out to dry and get on with their own lives.

After a couple of years mooching around and thinking over some things, I finally found a direction in life in that one thing I held in such contempt throughout my childhood; an education.

So for the past 3 years I have been trying to wrestle my way into a university that teaches genetics, and hopefully a fulfilling career in the long term. 

I've had a lot of ups and downs, and confronted a lot of personal issues including my chronic laziness and struggled to alleviate these negative aspects of myself, but next year I might finally be able to climb back into the saddle and really get myself primed for university with my A-levels.

However, at the age of 20 I am now well above the age all my friends aced their A-levels and strode off to uni. The price for 3 courses at a college will set me back several thousand pounds and my family is feeling the strain of supporting me while I selfishly pursue my own interests.

I feel that if I give up and abandon my education, I'll regress to the way I was in my school days and I'll lose everything I've worked so hard for up until this point, but if I dont I run the very real risk of damaging my relationship with my family.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_rco9i,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/rco9i/tenaciously_chasing_an_education_that_i_threw_in/,

Well, after a year, he recently he decided he needed to start getting involved with more girls, maybe he'd get a girlfriend, and most of all he was looking for a new fwb to have a close friendship with exactly like ours.

I was fine with this, but when I realized all the girls he'd begun chasing after had a specific look to them that was nothing like me, but he often noted that they had personalities, interests, and hobbies that were exactly the same as mine, I felt as if he was looking for me but wanted me in a different body, and recalled a time that he'd mentioned complimenting me to pacify me. I know he wasn't secretly pining for me. (He looks for thin and brunette, as opposed to my blonde and curvy (not fat curvy, christina hendricks type. It sounds nice but is frustrating sometimes because I feel like a caricature, as if I can't be elegant. Also, despite the username I have a normal shnoz, hah.))

I called off the sex, but we're still friends. He let it go so easily it stung, but at least he respected me enough not to try when I couldn't handle it.

Now I feel more insecure than ever, any time I see anything to do with sex it makes me cringe and imagine him with those thin, brunette girls. I know I can find guys who'd wanna have sex with me, who might find my body type to be ideal, but I don't think I feel sexy enough to handle one night stands yet, or fwb again, and after my first boyfriend revealed himself to be a completely different person after finally establishing the relationship, and the way my fwb could act like I was the world to him then shrug when I wanted to end it, I don't trust guys very much anymore.

Besides all that, I don't want to put my security into a guy, I want it in myself, but I don't know how to get to that point. I've taken up new hobbies, learned new crafts, how to play an instrument, am taking classes, studying for the sake of learning something new, etc.

Today is St. Patrick's Day. I went to a big festival downtown with some friends. I wasn't uncomfortable by the crowds, but I wasn't having a great time either. I really noticed that something was wrong with me when I was packed tightly in with a bunch of drunk happy people who were jumping up and down to the music while I just stood there, frozen. 

I've always been an introvert. I much prefer to stay home and play on the computer than go out and be social. Doing so drains me. If this was just an introvert thing, then I could deal with it, but there's more to it than that.

My screws are so tight all of the time. You know that feeling when you get drunk and your inhibitions go away and you realize how tightly wound you were? Well I'm tightly wound like that all the time. I can't dance in public because I'm too embarrassed. 

I still laugh and can still have fun, but I never get overly excited. Ever. I've been like this for as long as I can remember.

I've also always been ""the responsible one."" In college I never drank. I was always the DD, always sober, there to clean up after everyone else's mess. If you were my friend and you were drunk/hurt, you'd be happy to have my around because I could be counted on to be sober and level headed in an emergency. 

I turned into a massive tool. I realized it my junior year and said ""fuck that"" to just about everybody. I locked my doors during parties then. If someone needed to call 911, not my problem. 

I've always felt like an outsider, like I never really fit in. I have pretty bad self esteem issues. I think a lot of that is due to my weight. I've been working on that and have been getting better. (I diet and workout and have gotten results. A few more months and I'll hit my goal)

I feel like perhaps I wasn't socialized correctly as a child. Growing up I had one close friend. He and I did everything together, but then had a falling out when we reached college.

I've always felt awkward. My biggest fear in the world is being ""that guy."" I saw a lot of ""those guys"" in college and tried not to imitate them. I have tact. I don't rock out by myself in the corner of a party, I don't invite myself along, I know when people don't want me around.

I want to be a fun and cool guy that people like to hang out with, but I don't have the confidence or ability to relax enough to do it. Sorry if this isn't very articulate. I've been thinking about it for years and it's a complex swarm of issues that are inter-related. I haven't really gotten it all figured out just yet. I've just always felt like there was this invisible barrier between me and being happy/normal.

I am in a relationship right now that I think I am ruining. My gf (20) is extremely busy lately, with school and work. I, on the other hand, am in my final semester as a senior and mostly taking it easy. Because of this, I have a lot of free time. Free time I want to spend some with my SO. This evening, and multiple times this semester my SO and I have planned (so I think) to spend an evening together, but many times, in the last minute, she reneges, to spend time with other friends. 

When she does this, I get upset. I want to talk to her about it, but she completely cuts me off for the evening. This leads me to send stupid messages/texts. I have tried talking to her about it, telling her that I feel that she is ignoring my wants and being insensitive to me. When we talk it out like this, we seem to make progress, but it just keeps happening. 

This evening in particular she sent me a text before I thought she was going to spend the night with me saying she wanted to go ""have fun"" with other people and she brought up the fact that I would be hanging out with other people tomorrow, as if that is a reason for her to blow me off tonight. Note about tomorrow, i'm hanging out with other people because I already knew she was going to be busy, so I fail to realize how this is related. 

Anyway, end rant. Ask questions if you feel I am leaving out parts of the story. Obviously this is one sided. I just want advice on how I can stop doing this or how I could talk this out.

Tbh I've been a bad girlfriend in the past couple months, becoming very controlling, possessive, demanding, disrespectful at times. But recently, as part of an all or nothing talk my bf and I decided to work it out as long as we both made major changes. Things have been going well in that respect, I'm doing a lot more as far as focusing on school and spending time with my own friends so I don't rely on him.


There's this girl, in fact he's spending time with her right now as part of a religious group retreat he's been going to almost every year since he was 13. They hooked up 5 years ago and talk in bursts and he says he really likes having her as a friend. Fine.


When we were fighting horribly before this ultimatum talk he admitted today (after at least 4 fights in which I demanded the truth and he was defensive, he thinks he is to blame for it when she initiated it) he flirted with her a bunch over fb, talking about how fun their old hookup had been, sexual flirtation etc etc. I snooped, didn't see these particular messages but saw enough to see she kept throwing little suggestive sentences at him, like that he wouldn't be sleeping alone at this retreat, whatever that meant, and that he wasn't stopping it despite several fights about the issue before and my having requested he tell her to respect boundaries. 


I've used painkillers to deal with my uncontrollable emotions before, I have general anxiety and had (or have) major depression, although I'm thinking I might be bipolar. Before this girl appeared in the picture, I would sob and get frustrated when we would fight and he'd just want space, but it's gotten 20 times worse since she's been interfering. I was absolutely hysterical, thinking about ways I could kill myself (I used painkillers before to self-medicate for my anxiety and to stop my thoughts when I got suicidal) and I just took one and I'm finally calmed down.


I'm scared because I only have one left. And without it I don't know how I would ever deal with these times when I am crying so hard I can't breathe and I'm so desperate to talk to him I want to die, so desperate to stop being ignored I get hysterical and freak him out more. How do you guys deal with runaway emotions to the point where you feel like you are going to explode or die???

Last week I was talking to girl in our class and she told me that Nick said I “seemed really interesting, and he wanted to get to know me but I’m so quiet.” On Monday she invited me to lunch with them so I went.

Nick: “What degree are you studying for?”

Me: “English. … An English BA”

Nick: “So, why do you always sit all the way on the other side of the class?” [my side of the class is pretty much empty aside from 2-4 other people sometimes]

Me: *nervous smile* I-I uh…well I... *continues to stutter*

Nick: *is silent, turns around*
(The question caught me off guard and I was pretty much speechless. This has never happened to me before ;_; So embarrassing.)

We went to lunch in a caf and I was friendly, well I tried to be, but I just feel like I came off awkward and boring most of the time. :( I really wish I had asked Nick questions about himself too.

p.s. Nick has a gf so i doubt he's romantically interested but he seems like a friendly guy and he makes me pretty nervous. I wish I came off nicer.

p.p.s. Also this whole thing is kind of triggering my depression. Sometimes I seriously think ""I'll never be able to live my life to the fullest because anxiety will always hold me back. I might as well just kill myself."" How do I cope? I can't see a psych because i'm certain it would cost alot of money i don't have, my school doesn't have free psych care either.

**UPDATE**; I talked to the girl again today. We sat together in class today. I felt sort of bad because one of her friends who usually sits next to her came after and was like ""where do i sit?"" and she was like ""oh, just sit next to Jo.""

Her friend ""jokingly"" mentioned that she was being sidelined. I was a bit embarrassed/felt bad. But we all ended up in a group together and talked, etc. I never talked to Nick today though, I didn't even say ""hi.""

The memorial service was in mid January so we're talking over a month now. I live far away from said family but just having seen them &amp; having them call me on the phone occasionally sends me into depressions, makes me super irritable (not fair to my S.O.), etc. 

I want to re-break up with them. My father still goes all racist on the phone with a 'tough shit, this is who i am' attitude (and sometimes will come right out and say those words).

I was not depressed during the 5 yrs we'd been estranged. None of the issues have been resolved &amp; they refuse to talk about them. 

SO the question is.....I know I'm better off without them.....should I just do it?

Just no interest in anything else, I didnt think Id enjoy it and I have an addictive personality. 

Now Im smoking weed not only daily, but ALL THE FUCKING TIME. Being sober feels weird for me. And I do feel very anxious and uncomfortable and even kinda get panic attacks when I dont smoke. I realize this might sound like dependency, but dont fucking lecture me please because honestly TRUTHFULLY, I was always that anxious before I started smoking. I had panic attacks, couldnt relax, could barely get out of bed and weed just makes dealing with this shit a breeze with almost no negative affects. I do my job and school work just fine and it gives me a chance to think. I would not be able to write this shit right now sober, Id probably freak the fuck out. 

But I mean, Ive also done prescription drugs like anti anxiety drugs uhmm done adderall... ecstasy... Ive probably rolled at least every month since the first time I did it. Ive always waited at least two weeks between rolls though. I might do acid this week, but if I do itll be only a small hit of this batch that I watched my friends take and none of them like tripped balls or anything off one hit. 

What am I even saying? Do I sound messed up or like... a normal college kid just messing around? Im pretty sure I had/have ptsd. Does that constitute crazy? I was kinda raped or something like that. Man that really sucks to type out. Prettyyyy ashamed of that still, basically ruined me soo Im kind of a weak person now. It's awesome. I don't sleep. Its 4 am here.. Im sure Ill be asleep by 6 or 7 and I dont think ill have to work tomorrow so thats cool. Hopefully Im stoned enough to sleep at least three or four hours at a time though, cuz the nightmares wake me up frequently. And I have deja vu of these dreams and i have a hard time figuring out what really happened and what I dreamed up. thats crazy, right? Im pretty out of touch with reality but at least I go with the flow. Go to work, school, always high, see friends every moment in between them. Im THAT girl, the one who goes to sketchy parties just because well thats better than being home alone. Dont get me wrong, i like the people I see, but the non stop party lifestyle is obv frowned upon for people sexually assaulted at a party. 

I dont know, man, maybe the only sense of community I get to feel is with a bunch of fucked up college kids who do too many drugs because they fucking get it. A lot of us are in that same boat and I just cant feel crazy AND alone. 

i dont even know what I want anymore. Im not hopeless Im just.. taking it day at a time because when I ask these big questions I have no answers to.. I get overwhelmed. I really think I might be crazy.. or, at the very least, an extremely weak person who cant handle difficult life circumstances. Everybody has them. Mine happen to involve teenage parents, a meth addicted father, and a sexual assault (at the basics) but that should be handleable. 

Sometimes I wonder though if maybe I was sexually abused as a kid even though that freaks me out to type and ive never indulged the thought but i was around drug addicts. I have vague memories of my father shooting up at the kitchen table. I know he was sexually abused as a kid and i was frequently left with his fucked up family. and i hate being touched, have always hated being touched, to a degree of phobia possibly. I have always been numb, always been excellent at blocking out painful memories. 

I literally just dont feel like I know anything anymore. I used to think I was smart, but Im probably just THAT clueless

A few days ago I met up with a guy (we both consider each other friends despite never having spoken directly to each other) and had a drink. He's probably my first male friend in the past 5 years or so. We talked about quite a lot of things, and to sum it up: he's an awesome person.

So here’s what ails me. My issue stems from the fact that I’m a 21 year old dude and never had a meaningful relationship. Let me clarify – I had one long distance (met her in high school, dated a year, got my heart ripped out) But the thing about long distance relationships is that they suck, at least in my estimation. You never actually learn anything about the person, and when you do get to spend time together, every interaction is forced, as if you have to be happy with that person while you have the chance. Anyway, point is I don’t count that one. 

 Yes, I know, I’m only 21 and I have my whole life ahead of me to meet many multitudes of women.  And I’m not too particularly concerned with meeting “the love of my life” or any of that bullshit, at least not yet. However I AM looking for something.

Anyway – here’s the issue. I seem to be failing everywhere I look and I don’t know why. This isn’t a plea to pity - I feel like I have a lot to offer girls. I work out a ridiculous amount, I’m very, very smart, and I like to think that I can be pretty thoughtful. I can even be pretty smooth sometimes. But somehow, despite my best efforts, I’m still single, and I have been most of my entire life. And it’s starting to get into my head. 

I have a somewhat addictive personality, and I love to solve problems. I never give up on problems, which is a great asset to a wannabe scientist such as myself, but when it comes to this, no amount of thinking can help. I see my friends with all this drama happening in their life, I juxtapose it with my own, fairly empty one, and I enter this spiral where I think and think and think and wonder and wonder and wonder what I can be doing wrong. I can come up with no conclusion other than that I am somehow cursed, somehow damned, or somehow missing some vital piece of information that every child gleaned as an adult about how to deal with people. 
Now I know all this is bullshit. The real problem lies in that this cripples my confidence, and that cripples my odds with girls. Women can sense that sort of thing. It repels them faster than… something that repels women really fast. (Don’t look at me like that I’m a science major, not a fucking liberal arts major). The end result is this sort of self-fulfilling prophecy, where I can’t get a ladyfriend because I don’t have any confidence, and I don’t have any confidence because I don’t have a ladyfriend.

Is there anything I can do other than just wait it out, man the fuck up, and hope something happens to me? I’d prefer to be proactive in my life, rather than just sitting around waiting for something that may never happen without a push.

I am doing something wrong, but I don't know what. Let me give you an overview of my past week:
A large group of people found out that I hooked up with several girls. I'm single but this is still frowned upon.
A girl I was slightly seeing (non-exclusively) saw this and got upset, so I ended things with her even though she wanted to still continue. It would have just hurt her more later on if I didn't end it now.
A roommate put into words what I have been doing the past half year. I tend to become selfish really quickly and don't ever show emotion. Also, that I drink a lot.

I never have had a problem with women, and went throughout highschool dating girls but it was honestly just giving a name to hooking up. Once I got to college I dated one girl who I really cared about but that ended poorly about a year ago. So for this academic year, I've just been manipulating girls. I like my entertainment, and once they can't entertain me any more I move on. I'm in a culture which promotes drinking and hooking up, I just got very good at it. Most likely due to the fact that I usually don't worry much about other people.
Whenever an event happens in my life that would elicit some kind of emotion, like anger or sadness, I quickly look at the situation and determine what reaction should be given. I then display that emotion.
I've been going to a therapist since the beginning of the academic year, but nothing substantial has happened.
I don't want to do this any more. What's up with me, or how can I change? Should I even worry that much?

She was the first (and so far only) person I kissed and who kissed my dick. This was for 6 months when I was 15-16, and she was 17. She broke up with me probably because I didn't want to have sex with her, but she said she was too busy with school to have a relationship. When she started dating another guy 3 months later she began posting stuff about how much better he was than me on myspace so I found out she was lying about being too busy. I turned into a rage monster who would punch things and send her 50 emails a day begging for her back or I will kill myself. That's hyperbole, but I did threaten her with suicide and send her a lot of emails, which she replied to by calling me a pussy and listing all my bad qualities. Eventually I lost interest. I felt really angry and extremely depressed for about a solid two years afterwards, and didn't really want anything to do with anyone.

So about two years later, I'm now almost 18 and this other girl starts talking to me on myspace. I thought she was really pretty and nice, so I end up taking a break from being a functioning derelict to ask her out for coffee, and I really liked her. I ask her to hang out twice more which she doesn't follow through with, but she tells our friends she likes me. A month later she starts dating someone else and takes care to remind everyone of his superiority to everyone else she's ever know, which I felt was directed at me. I experienced a Vietnam flashback and began punching my floor. I come to the conclusion that she must have never liked me and only led me on to hurt my feelings. So I do the reasonable thing and make a fake profile of my sister to ask her through it why she did those things. I didn't feel confident enough to ask her myself, and was extremely afraid of being hurt more than I already was. She contacts me on my real account to call me a fucking idiot a few times and hurt me more than I already was. Eventually she figures out my sister and I are the same person and stops talking to me, and tells all our friends so they stop talking to me too, which I probably deserved. At this point I felt reasonably confident in my ability to kill myself. I tell that to a friend I still had, who asks me if they can tell the girl I liked, and I say yes because I want her to know this feel for some dumb fucking reason. She tells the school and a bunch of her friends, and we have to meet with a councilor to talk it out. She said she never meant to lead me on or anything, but I didn't really believe her and I spend the whole time sitting angry trying not to cry like a pussy instead of beating the shit out of her. She's still in my top 3 ""People I Wish I Beat The Shit Out Of' list, and now I'm 20 and I still have nightmares frequently starring her.

I tried to have like two other relationships after that, but they usually noticed I was an emotional fuck-up and stopped it pretty fast. 

I typically think of how terrible my love life has been 4 or 5 times a day, which depresses me 4 or 5 times a day. Most women look like long haired men to me now, so I no longer really find them very attractive. I'm not really sexual anymore, and I have trouble getting and keeping an erection. I'm almost totally apathetic to forming a romantic relationship with anyone, I just think it's too hard to trust anyone and put the effort into a relationship when they're just going to be a jerk anyways. Sometimes I think about starting a relationship just to break it off in a really cruel way, I guess as a form of revenge. Other times I just wish my ex and that other one would call me or something to just say they're sorry. This morning I woke up wishing for an apology, and I thought if I ever made anyone feel shitty I'd try to apologize for it. So I sent a message on Facebook to a girl who obviously liked me but I ignored/made fun of because I was depressed as fuck and all my friends put it in her butt. I felt really bad about just sort of disapproving of her existence, so I thought at the very least I could tell her I was sorry incase there was anything bothering her like there was bothering me. She told me she didn't know who I was, that she already had a boyfriend and blocked me. So I guess she wasn't really bothered.

TL;DR - I sort of want to be with someone, but every time I think about it I just think about all the other times I've tried and how it wasn't worth it at all. Would trying again be worth it? Am I even justified in feeling hurt? How do I get over all the shit that already happened?

I'm 28, male. I appear to have some deep-seated insecurities and lack of confidence. It has effected my life in a very negative way and I'm attempting to face it head on and finally fix it. 


I know this isn't ""r/relationships"", but a lot of the symptoms of these insecurities have been disturbingly emphasized during a recent, 8 month long relationship. A relationship that I'm no longer in. I'm going to talk about that relationship to help me explain how my insecurities are manifesting themselves, but I am looking for personal advice, not specific relationship advice.


She is a very secure, confident and emotionally independent woman. She's incredibly comfortable in herself, is very passionate about her interests, is very emotionally mature, has a strong awareness of herself and seemingly those around her. She's also a very intelligent girl.


We began the relationship on bad footing. It was an amazing, whirlwind, romantic beginning, but I had come straight from a 4 year relationship that had crumbled, straight to this girl. Yes, I know this wasn't the *best* idea looking back on it, but what can I say, I let myself get carried away by happy, romantic feelings.


The first signs of my insecurities began to show their ugly head when I stupidly questioned her faithfulness to me in a massive display of mistrust, with absolutely no justification to do so. Having come from a 4 year relationship, I was unconsciously expecting her to fill the void that should only be met by someone after 4 years together, not, at the time, 3 months. As our relationship continued, my insecurities continued to eat me up inside in that self-destructive way that they do. I convinced myself that she had ulterior motives with me, that she was using me for money, that she would find someone better looking and more interesting than me. I believed I wasn't good enough for her.


The way these insecurities manifested themselves would mostly be through anger. Inevitably a minor dispute would allow me to explode with all of these internal insecurities and completely blow up. I would say the most incredibly vicious things to her. Horrible, mean things that would make anyone believe I had no love for this girl. I would truly believe that she was evil personified. I would completely break down, I mean epically. It would have absolutely no bearing on the initial disagreement. I'd just go into another dimension. 


I also, strangely, took offence to her interests that we didn't share. It's very odd. It's as though her passions that we didn't share are in some way an insult to me. What was that all about? I think I felt judged and unworthy for not having the exact same passions as her. My insecure feelings would be further emphasized in a certain social circle of hers. A social circle revolved around passionate musicians, a talent I unfortunately don't have. 


The silly thing is, underneath these silly, pointless emotions, all these points that I mention are a few of the reasons I love her so much. I love her passion for life and her interests. I love exploring her interests, her loves and her hates, her opinions and her knowledge. Our passions do cross over as well, a lot. So it's not like I can have justification to feel insecure about a few differences in interests. 


Another thing worth noting - I feel I see her imperfections, as minor as they are, and I love her for them. But, for some reason her blind confidence got to me in a big way. It's as though I needed her to be less confident. I needed her to acknowledge some faults for my own sanity. This feels like a very emotionally ugly need, one that I'm very ashamed of.


These insecurities quickly found their way into the bedroom as well. Here is a girl with whom I was exploring the best love making of my life. A sexual connection like no other I've ever had. This should have been one of the most interesting and explorative parts of our relationship together, and my life. Instead, these silly, baseless emotions dogged much of it. Much of the same emotions - feelings of inadequacy, comparing myself to others and feeling a lot of intimidation by her own sexual awareness.


These insecurities aren't just confined to relationships with girls. I've had them with friends as well. I worry that friends who I like the most couldn't possibly like me. I wonder if I'm annoying and insignificant. I think this may be why I'm far more comfortable meeting people for the first time than forming long-term relationships - I just can't imagine people would like me when they get to know me. It effects every part of my life and I'm aware of how it holds me back in so many parts of my life, especially the parts involving other people. It's a feeling that's just there whenever I have any interaction with absolutely anyone.


I'm unsure of where these insecurities come from. I can't pinpoint them to specific experiences. A very brief summary of significant past events that may or may not be have played a part in who I am today..


* As a child of 7, I had deep and long feelings of being unloved by my parents and family when they divorced and had uneasy and conflicting relationships with both of my parents partners.

* Elementary school was dogged by bullying and loneliness. 

* High School was tough, as it is for most. I was an awkward, gangly, cystic acne infested teen. I would chose to be alone when I could and often missed a lot of school.


I'm outwardly confident in social situations though - I normally hold conversation well, people seem to enjoy my company as I take a keen interest in people I meet, I'm clear in how speak and my body posture is one of a confident person. I really enjoy meeting new people. When I think rationally, I know I'm a decent looking guy and I'm in a good, high paying profession. I am also very well travelled and a fairly intelligent and knowledgable guy. I should really be an over confident person if anything.


I'm trying to stay away from self-pity, but I am feeling angry with myself, as well as very regretful and upset at recent events. Here was an amazing, beautiful, interesting girl. She was loving, open, intelligent and fun. Someone who I should have only ever been sharing an explorative time of my life with, shared mutual loves and passions, someone who I should have been enjoying and savouring every moment with. Instead, I was dominated by these emotions and they prevented our relationship from ever reaching its potential. I was demanding something of her emotionally that nobody could ever provide. I really can't emphasize enough how crippling these feelings of insecurity have been.


Underneath all the nonsense, I had a real love for her. At the forefront of my mind, I'm deeply disturbed by how I could be this way to someone I love so much. I caused her a lot of unnecessary pain and hurt. The amazing times were truly amazing and she is such an amazing woman. Although we're both hopeful for another chance in the future, I've simply had to accept that I have lost something amazing and it is purely through my own fault. I can't change what I've done but I can try my best to prevent it from happening again. I would like to be able to go into a relationship as a confident person who will only show love and nurture for all these amazing qualities that my partner has, not develop a fierce insecurity and needs that are impossible to satisfy. I want to be an emotionally strong person. I don't want to be someone who has to be with a weak, unstimulating partner to make myself feel secure. I recognize that quality as something negative, incredibly selfish and unhealthy. I need to shake off these ugly attributes. I want to be a very confident person. I want to have healthy relationships. I'm eager to explore my sexuality with someone I love and explore the person I love without these incredible feelings of self doubt and unworthiness. I want to express the genuine love I feel for someone, without needing the feelings of approval and reassurance. Most of all, I don't want to find myself hurting someone I love ever again. Ever.


I appear to have *some* clarity on my situation, but just gaining the clarity isn't giving me the ability to change myself. Any advice, explanations or tips reddit? What's your take on my problems? What actions do I need to do to make these changes? Should I expand on anything I've spoken about?

I didn't realize until I went to a counselor, because I was taking the break up pretty hard, that I had even been in a pattern of pushing people away by either lashing out at them or doing something I knew would be unforgiveable.  I moved to a new city and state a year and half ago because I realized my life wasn’t going anywhere and I wanted to improve it.

I’ve never really felt like I would amount to much or that I’m particularly special, like so many people I just existed. I used to sleep around, party, and go to work, and I thought that was all my life would be. Then I moved up north and I met Pete and he was this amazing guy who is open, smart, funny, and nice. And he liked me. He wanted to help me and be my friend, and it has been a long time since anyone has been interested in me as a person, I forgot what it felt like to have someone care about arbitrary things in my life. We started dating but I always had this nagging feeling that I wasn’t good enough for him. I pushed it aside because I wanted to be happy, I wanted it to work and I thought if I ignore my doubts it can.  But then my uncertainty crept back in, and soon began to surface into our relationship.   

I did something 6 months ago, not to be malicious to Pete, because I now understand that if I had asked him he would’ve helped me. But at the time I never even thought to ask for help.  I did it because I’m a coward; I think that if I ask for help or if I show that I’m lost or frail. I’ll be toss aside. I know that’s pathetic but I don’t know I feel worthless and Pete didn’t see me like that so I couldn’t tell him. Once Pete found out what I had done he dumped me.  And I don’t blame him. Oddly enough I was relived because I knew he’d be better off without me.

{Disclaimer changed my ex-boyfriend’s name also not sure if this belong in break ups or not but since this isn’t the only self-destructive thing I have done I thought I would start here.}

I'm 26 he's 23, I do not have a good relationship with my family. For instance I was molested by my brother when I was 8, I told my mother and not only did she not believe she beat me and called me a liar after.

After a while i knew for sure i would marry them. they were my everything and i truly cared about them. or so i thought. after being berated for hours by my friends and family, their friends and family, ive realized that i may have never cared about them. before this, even though me and them had bad patches, we never put a foot wrong. we were truly happy with each other but my insecurity, my stupidity, my possible mental issues ruined everything. I have lost my soulmate and this is how: about 4 months ago, they hung out with someone else and i couldnt take it.

i was afraid of losing them, especially when they came back home and told me they had feelings for them. Even though this was the case, they told me they loved me and would not let this get in the way. I couldn't take it, for whatever reason i started using anonymous aliases and started harassing the one person i cared for more than anyone else in the world. soon another person popped into the picture and i did the same with them to make them look bad to the one i cared about. i hurt the person i cared about so much that they hurt themselves. they would cry and i would try and comfort them but they were sad cause of me. i caused so many problems for them and i truly do not deserve them. i am in a horrible place right now and i wish nothing but happiness for the other person. i wish nothing bad sadness for myself.

i ruined the person i cared about, scarred them for life. i ruined their closest friendships because of my stupidity. i dont know what to do or how to recover from this. i shouldnt recover from this. i hurt her so much. we're broken up obviously and i wont try to even show her my face. im so ashamed of myself and if there was an off button on my life i would prefer it but i wont commit suicide. i just want to go back in time and fix it. i want the pain to stop not only for myself but for the other person but theres no point. any encouragement? you guys can berate me if you want. i deserve it.

From the outside, I seem to be doing really well. I graduated college with a good degree, got an awesome job within a week, and just got an apartment where I can finally get out on my own.

In reality, I'm a freaking mess. I struggle with depression frequently, but it's never enough to make me do anything but be a mopey train wreck for a few weeks (I guess I should be thankful about that). Usually it comes on after I perceive some sort of failure on my part, so in the past few years I've become more and more risk averse. It's not affecting my daily activities per-se, I just tend to not want to do anything new. It affects really weird areas of my life, like I won't play online games because I'm scared that the nameless and faceless people I play with or against will think less of me. It puts strain on my friendships because I'm afraid to go and hang out, especially with people I don't know. I never go out alone. I'm sure it's some kind of social anxiety, but I've always been too embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. I'm not very fit or good looking, although I'm working on getting back in shape. I know I can (my first two years of college I was very fit... depression killed that for the next two years), but as always it's slow going. I've never dated or kissed a girl, and I'm still a virgin. I've always been interested in girls, but I've been scared to be in a relationship even though I want one. Part of it is confidence (I don't think I'm good/experienced enough) and I'm trying to reverse years of convincing myself that I'm mostly worthless.

I know I should be excited about my future and all of the possibilities, but I feel like I'm so ruled by fears and inadequacies that I'll never accomplish anything. Case and point; there's this girl (isn't there always) that I'm interested in dating. We were good friends in High School, drifted apart, and recently met back up. We've gone out as friends, and it's been awesome. Which is part of the problem; she's such an awesome friend to me that I'm afraid to ask her if she'd be willing to try dating. Part of me is screaming ""GO FOR IT! TAKE THE SHOT!"" while the rest of me is saying (what I feel to be logically), ""Look at yourself. You're lucky she even talks to you. Don't ruin what you already have. Greed corrupts you."" It's like I can't turn off that part of my brain that keeps telling me to proceed cautiously and avoid making mistakes. I know I NEED to mess up in order to learn and experience, but it's like self preservation is keeping me from trying. 

So... how do you turn off a part of you that you've relied on to help you make decisions all of your life? Do I have a bigger problem than just my aversion to risk? Is there something I'm missing? Should I just wait it out and ""get better?"" Or is that logical part of me doing me more favors than I realize?

**TL;DR I'm a successful looking guy with some issues on the inside. I'm so risk averse and driven by fear that I'm afraid I'll never take a chance on something.**

About two months into our relationship, I decided to bust out the L word. I really think that I love him. He rejected it saying it was too soon, then a week later confessed that he was in a long relationship a few years ago that lingered as a friendship up to this day. He said he really felt love with her, and hasn't felt that with me, and asked if I was alright taking things slow as he got over the heartbreak.

I was too taken aback to do anything but agree, and that was the end of that. I haven't had it in me to bring it up again.

But it's killing me. It's caused such a jealousy. I am doing weird things like checking really far back in his facebook history to see their interactions. I've been tempted to check his texts to see if he's talking to her, but I haven't.

It isn't normal. Now 2 months later, we're exactly where we were, nothing hinting towards him loving me. There have even been some weird commitment issues on his part (He made a big deal when I said ""We're going to the party"" rather than ""You and I are going to the party"" today, little things like that which stick in my memory). 

I don't know how to say ""Remember that detail about your ex you shared with me a few months ago? It has been on my mind absolutely constantly and we need to discuss it"" without sounding like a creeper. 

I don't know if what I'm doing is helping him or holding him back in getting over this ex (I actually asked him when he told me flat out if we needed to break up for him to come to terms with it at a distance from other relationships, and he said no.) 

I'm constantly afraid of doing something that will remind him of her, like accidentally playing their song or whatnot. And I'm always paranoid that he is thinking of her, sometimes it influences what I think his intentions are. (Vague facebook wall post? Must be about her...)

I'm afraid that even if love comes up between us, I'll never be his first pick (His exact words when I asked if he still had feelings for her were ""Doesn't matter, she wouldn't take me back anyway""), I'll always be the one he settles for after his ""soulmate"" fled. 

Despite me just listing out the absolute worst part of our relationship, I promise that it isn't all that bad.

The last years I have noticed while dating girls, that I am somehow extremely sensitive to... well I find it hard to describe. Sensitive to the budding of arguments. When I feel that a girl is not taking me seriously, or when I feel that I am not being taken into account, I feel a resentment building up. I feel myself standing ready to detect any signs of being criticized, and then feel hurt about it. 

But I do not start any arguments, because when I think about starting an argument, I get really anxious. I imagine conversations in my head where I am being put down. I fear that the girl will not take me seriously, or will invalidate my feelings, and I freeze up, I am paralyzed, and I bottle up my feelings. When that happens, I lose my attraction to the girl I am dating.

This reddit made me start thinking about the underlying causes. I think that it has something to do with my parents. My mother has always made all the decisions in our household, and she never lets any opportunity pass to put down my father, and my father is silent about it and bottles up his feelings like I do. I used to become really angry about this whenever I thought about it for a while, and felt that I had to protect him. I felt I had to address my mother about this, and sometimes I did, but it never worked out, because my mother would feel herself a victim and my father would get angry because he didn’t want my help. 

At times I am boggled by my father’s choices in life. At how he is frustrated and stressed out all the time. And somehow he seems to take it out on me and my brother by saying we are screw-ups every other day. I never knew whether to protect him or be angry at him. Because if I started to argue with him for being unkind, my mother would seize the opportunity to jump in and criticize my father again, alongside me, and I would feel sorry for him.

I very well know that I am not a screw-up. I have a great education and a job and a fantastic group of close friends, both guys and girls, who really appreciate me. And I know intellectually that my parents both love me. I am actually quite happy with the person I am becoming, but I am also scared of ending up in a relationship similar to that of my parents. I would never accept to be in a relationship like the one my father is in. But I do not really know how to... avoid it. In my dating life I am usually drawn towards shy girls because they seem more considerate, but girls themselves are not the problem. My emotions are; they are not reasonable. I can always manage to find fault in a girl, but I know that I do this because I am afraid to get invalidated in a relationship, like my father is all the time, and not being able to live like I want to. 

Do you have any advice for me, reddit?

When I was a shy, nerdy teenager (circa 2004 when I was 16; I’m 24 now), I made a dear friend through an online discussion board. He sent me a private message one night, and we began chatting (on AIM) and eventually developed a wonderful friendship. We never talked all that often (every few weeks or so), but whenever we did, it felt great. I was probably depressed as a teenager and having a good looking, charming guy who was a couple of years older (he was just out of high school when we started talking) listen to a lonely nerd girl me felt like the best thing in the world. Furthermore, our conversations always had a slightly flirtatious edge to them, which boosted my self-esteem even more. As time passed, we talked less frequently yet our conversations always exuded the same instant chemistry. The flirtations eventually escalated to the point where we met up in person one summer (2009) when I was visiting a nearby family member (although to be honest, I organized the trip mostly to visit him, something he was more or less aware of). 

The weeks prior to our meeting, our online conversations had reached the point of the graphically flirtatious. Although we only spent 3 days together out of the 7 or so days I was in his area, I had my first sexual experience (ever, with anyone) with him. There was no intercourse, but it was the first time I was even naked with a guy. Moreover, it was consensual, and I don’t regret it at all. When I was naked, he told me – with a tone of genuine surprised satisfaction – that I have a “great body.” I’d always buried myself in loose-fitting androgynous clothes (I was a bit of a tomboy, as well as very shy), and hearing this from an attractive guy who I’ve admired for years just sent my self-esteem through the roof.  

Anyway, I went home, and our online friendship continued as before. We flirted a lot but never seriously talked about a relationship. We met a couple of more times (once in 2010, another time earlier this year – I had intercourse for the first time ever with him during the latter), but in between we (I?) got into an intense amateur porn routine. I sent him videos of me touching myself, and I loved hearing him talk about my body. Frankly, I enjoyed doing it, but deep down I think I had the hope that this would somehow bring him closer to me in a physical (as opposed to a virtual, internet) sense.

This would require a whole other messy write-up, but it turns out he was in an on/off relationship for a large part of our friendship (2007 to now). He always identified the tall pretty girl I’d see in a lot of his Facebook pictures as an ex with whom he’s really good friends when I asked (we’d spend our visits together holed up in a hotel room). And given that I convinced myself that I trusted him so much and that our friendship was unique, I always believed him at his word rather than try to piece together his life from social networking sites that supposedly never really convey a person anyway. And because he’s finally trying to give that relationship 100%, we no longer flirt (in conversation or through media). But we still talk. 

I think having this friendship dominate my emotional (and sexual?) life for so long (I never dated or had sex with anyone else until very recently) has messed me up in a lot of ways. But most significantly, I think it’s disconnected me from my body. I used to be a total hornball in a healthy way (even when I was really shy and before this friendship turned sexual) but now I barely masturbate. I just feel indifferent about my body overall. I go through instances where I binge on desserts (for example, I just now ate about 14 pieces of some fancy chocolate I recently got for a birthday gift), feel like shit and tell myself I won’t do it again, but then I will later in the week. I know I’m clearly not fat and that I’m even still a little underweight (I’m a very petite young woman with a slender/curvy balance), but something’s off somewhere with me. Most of all, I think of my friend’s on/off girlfriend (now girlfriend!). To me, she’s the one he “chose” to have a relationship with, and all I can think about is the superficial – how tall and slender she is. 

How do I begin to heal? From the unhealthy body image issue and from giving so much of myself to a delusion in the first place?

Okay. This is obviously a throwaway account, but I am a pretty active redditor, since this summer. Before that, I used to be on 4chan, something awful, etc. So the whole idea of appealing to an open forum of likeminded people with my issues anonymously isn't beyond me.

There's a lot to type and I don't even know what order to go about things, so if you have any questions, I can elaborate. I feel pretty shitty most of the time.

My parents are divorced and I have no real relationship with either parent or their SO's. My mom left my dad for another woman, stayed with her four a number of years, left her for another woman, and then after around three years, this second woman broke up with my mom. Neither of them liked me very much.

After my mom left my dad, he found a woman, they married, and now she lives with him. She doesn't like me very much either.

There was always tension between both households in terms of when my mom or dad see me. Both parents would constantly make an issue about when the other parent didn't see me, and I never felt wanted in either household.

In high school, I had a big problem where I jumped from clique to clique, and only near the end did I figure out who I really enjoyed spending time with. I have a few people I can call on, but I don't seem to have the gigantic network of people I can call on when I visit home. If three or four people don't pick up their phones, I have nothing to do that night.

I recently transferred colleges. The first school was a commuter school, and the number of people I could reliably form bonds with was limited. I was really heavily involved with a few student organizations, because I thought that was how to make friends, but then I realized the organizations never accomplished much of what their mission statements set out for, and I didn't like the people very much at all, outside of a common interest or two. It was really only in my last semester there that I found a small group of four or five people I really enjoyed spending time with. I still see them from time to time, and they're still good friends, but when I look back on how much time and effort I put into all of those other people- and how little I have to show for it now- it makes me feel sad.

My new school is more catered towards my academic interests, and I'm glad, for my future, that I made the switch. But it's in a more urban area with very little going on for college students, and very little green, quiet places. Even more of the students are commuters, and the organizations are even more lacking. Community wise, I feel even more out of my element, and feel like I'm having a harder time meeting new people. I've been here for a whole semester and I don't know anybody here except for one kid I know from high school and my roommates.

My dad's house is less than half an hour away from my college campus, but I don't feel welcome there. My stepmother dislikes me and has effectively kept me out of my dad's house since I graduated high school. Conversations with her always get hostile and start attacking my mother. I figured I would live with my mother over the summer to escape it, but then her conversations with her SO would always get hostile and start attacking my father. I never felt at peace, or wanted, in either household.

I was overweight for most of my life and felt pretty sensitive about that, but in the last year managed to start working out, and lost weight. My mom and her SO at the time ridiculed me every day and tried to get me to gain back weight. I have- I stopped exercising as much because of a busier school schedule and colder weather, and I feel really bad about my current state of fitness.

The only girlfriend I've ever had I met on okcupid on a whim, and I spent last summer with her. She was great to me, and her parents treated me like one of their own. She showed me affection when I wasn't getting it from anyone and it felt fantastic. I thought I wouldn't miss her, but I think about her almost every day and it's driving me sick. At this point, I've spent more time alone thinking about spending time with her than I've actually spent with her over the summer. I wanted to give her a call, but she has a new boyfriend now, and there's nothing to talk about, besides how lonely I am, and how difficult it's still being for me to find someone new. I don't think I'm going to talk to her, at least until I find someone else.

At this point, I feel like I'm having a difficult time making new friends. I feel like I have no relationship with either of my parents. And I feel incredibly alone and sexually frustrated- I wish I was a boyfriend again. Sometimes I just fall into this kind of... pit of loneliness, and I don't know what to do.

I am trying to figure out what prevents me from becoming emotionally connected to someone, as I don't think I have ever been in love. I have been seeing a psych for about 6 months, but we haven't seem to really get anywhere.

For example, if my wife was to be hit by a bus and paralyzed, I would NOT want to deal with that. I recognize that no one really does, but rather than just accept that the chances of the happening are incredibly small, I think I avoid the situation by not becoming close to anybody.

I'm 22/M, never been into a relationship, actually I am a kissless virgin.

The problem is that is just to hard to me to get a girlfriend because there's no girls on my classes and through the years in college I only developed friendships with guys due to that, also I'm not particularly a confident person because I have a somewhat severe column deformation since an early in age that pretty much makes me live in pain everyday and it also makes my silhouette look not so good, aside from that I'm pretty good looking. 

Right now I just feel that I can't have a girlfriend in a near future, college is taking most of my time, I barely have money to pay my bills I've health problems that are hard/impossible to solve. The feeling that I will end up alone is tearing my motivation apart and I don't know what to do.

I'm currently a senior in college and I've had a huge crush on a guy (G) since freshman year, when I didn't even really know him. We're both currently 21. As soon as I saw him, I pegged him as the guy I wanted to marry and I can't stop thinking about it, even though he and I haven't spent much time together. I've dated other guys in the meantime, but I was never happy because G was always in the back of my mind. 

I'm not sure what to do. He and I are both socially awkward and it's hard for me to have a normal conversation because I get really nervous around him. All my friends question why I like him so much, as, well, he's a republican and very politically minded, and I'm not. I feel safe when I'm around him and he's the only guy on campus I would ever consider dating. The other guys I dated didn't go to my school, but still, it didn't seem right.

What is this and why won't it dissipate?",epicspieltime,7,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/mz56s/deep_baseless_resentment_is_consuming_my_life_and/,"**TL/DR**  A recent break-up has catalyzed deep feelings of resentment... a lot deeper than should be expected.  Now I feel bitter and resentful of nearly everything and everyone around me, and it's killing me.  How do I let go of this feeling?

I'm sorry if this just seems like I'm spouting off random details about myself.  I didn't realize I'd written out so much! I'm trying to think of anything that could be relevant to my problem, and this is the best I could do:

I'm a 25-year-old woman with a reasonably normal life.  I support myself with a full-time job and live with a wonderful roommate.  I have a handful of good friends - we jam, camp, watch movies, cook, and occasionally get drunk together.  I feel like I have a good life and that I am lucky.

My last relationship ended at the beginning of October.  I was the one who ended it, but it catalyzed these deep feelings of resentment that I feel have been ""dormant"" (or at least unacknowledged on my part) for quite some time, and now I feel like my life is slowly rotating into an uncontrollable snowball of ugly resentment and self-pity.

Basically, I had a summer fling with a complete tool, ""Tom"".  I'm surprised I'm still so **angry** about it, because as a serial monogamist, of course I've experienced longterm relationships with intense periods of discord without as much collateral damage as I feel I received from what should have been a bit of ""harmless fun"".  

I knew, on some level, the entire time I was with Tom that he was largely just using me for my (limited) resources and he didn't have anything better to do.  I have no question in my mind that I was a distraction and ""project"" for him more than I was an actual relatable human being.  

I knowingly put myself through the process of allowing this guy to consistently disrespect not just me, but my roommate and my other friends (male and female alike) as well.  Tom is a buffoon, a hypocrite, an alcoholic, and an unemployed ne'er-do-well.  I suspected these things about him before we started dating, confirmed them while were dating, and eventually ended the relationship after I started feeling so worthless that I was having a hard time holding it together emotionally at work.  I certainly don't need to graphically describe in great detail all of his many shortcomings, but if you'd like to know more about that relationship, I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/krk2a/im_getting_too_old_to_invest_in_something_with_so/) plea for help during the sunset period of our time together, and basically got the unanimous advice to get rid of him as quickly as possible.  That's when I was still trying to somehow rationalize continuing on with him.

Tom moved out of my home and shortly afterward set up camp on a local Occupy site.  That seems all well and good, but honestly -- he's homeless, jobless, and he's pissed off his rich parents so much that he can never go home, and all of his friends know better than to take him in -- and as an opportunist of the lowest moral quality, I guess he's decided that a movement that regularly receives donations of food and toiletries (and sometimes even booze and cigarettes) from our community is the perfect place to squat until he finds someone else to take advantage of.  He stayed with me rent-free all summer, even after I hooked him up with a job through an old work contact, which he promptly lost right after we broke up.  He's fucking useless, and that's a fact.

So, all right.  It's been a couple months.  I dated a guy on and off for three years at one point and it only took me about this much time to brush my shoulders off and get back into the game after that finally ended.  However, after this most recent disaster, I don't even feel motivated to date at all.  This is the first time in years that I've had zero prospects -- and it's not because I couldn't find them if I looked, it's just that I can't even summon the energy or willpower to look -- and I guess I have to admit that I'm willfully blinding myself to anyone who has expressed a romantic interest in me lately as well.

I don't know why I put myself through that mess with that guy.  I don't know why I was smart enough to realize he was a leech and still somehow *needed* to go through the process of being with him, of ""rescuing"" him.  There were aspects of his personality that I found attractive (he's very ""alpha""), but even early on they were overshadowed by his dismissive attitude toward... well... pretty much everything.  Including me.  And I had a very audible voice in the back of my mind going, ""NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.""  the *entire* time.  The sex wasn't as fantastic as he wanted to pretend it was for me, he was slightly lacking in the hygiene area, you know... I'm just baffled.

I don't feel like things are getting better for me with time.  I'm a lot busier now, but it's not because I'm motivated to get things done -- it's because I'm motivated to remain distracted.  I know that if I sit down and stop ""doing shit"" for long enough, I'm going to start getting pissed off again.  About the break-up, about things related to the break-up... I have a female friend, Karen, for whom I was a friggin' *rock* during her break-up and I ended up setting her up with my most eligible male friend while I was dating Tom.  After Tom and I broke up, she was ""there"" for me for the space of a fifteen-minute-long phone call and since then, all I get are random messages from her that she ""misses me"" and ""we need to do something"", but whenever I contact her to solidify plans, she always has some excuse (usually related to the guy I set her up with) or she just ends up flaking.  So, I'm mad about that.

I don't snap about day-to-day inconveniences or anything, I just feel like I have to put a lot of work to keep from obsessing over these circumstances where I feel I've been wronged.  I don't feel the urge to lash out necessarily, I just can't deal with these negative feelings and I've caught myself occasionally being snide in mixed company and just sort of bitter in a way I never wanted to be... I'm more and more paranoid about the intentions of people around me, even my best friend of over a decade.  I can't shake the feeling that people are judging me and wish me harm, and in turn, sometimes I unhealthily indulge in these bouts of negativity.  I hope Tom is miserable.  I'm not involved with the Occupy movement at all -- something I would otherwise be all about -- just because I'm so resentful of it for providing a circumstance for Tom to continue living as a parasite... and now he can hide behind having a ""cause"" and justify his lifestyle.  I hope
Karen gets dumped and has no one to bolster her self-esteem.  I fantasize about seducing her boyfriend, a good friend of mine for whom I've never had any significant attraction -- just because of the validation I would feel having wronged her.  

Whereas a lot of the people close to me would describe me as incredibly forgiving, empathetic, and supportive... I just don't feel that way anymore.  I feel like I'm wearing the skin of a different person, a better person, that I no longer am.

I don't know what's happening, and I'm scared.  Is this part of growing up?  Is this at all normal?  I just don't want to do this anymore.  I don't want to feel so bitter and shitty.  I don't want to BE a shitty person.  Please help!

I'm beginning to think it's unhealthy, I don't want to be so attached to him already. 

The thing is, the problem isn't him at all. He's not so special, really. He's mildly good looking and a feminist, both of which appeal to me. But if I hadn't met him, I'm sure I'd be infatuated with someone else, instead. It feels like I have this need to have a crush on a guy, all the time.

What do I do? I'm scared because I don't want to be alone and I don't know how to explain this to other people, or want to explain it.

6 months before we started dating I just had gotten out of my first relationship that lasted about 10 months with a girl that I went to high school with and we dated while we were sophomores in college (went to same school). I broke up with my ex gf because I was not particularly happy in the relationship. These two girls know each other and things went pretty smoothly when my ex found out who my new gf was.   

Heres where things get tricky... we were in sort of the same social group in college and we would often all be in the same setting at bars and at parties.  There were a few times where me and my ex ended up by ourselves and did nothing more than simple flirting.  The furthest it ever went was making out one time for a few minutes while I was on a very small (few day) break with my current gf.  about a year has past since the time we made out.  Since then about once a month either me or her initiate conversation via text message when we are drunk (75% me, 25% her).  I have tried to stop and havent contacted her in over 3 months.  HOWEVER, I CANT GET HER OUT OF MY MIND.  I THINK ABOUT HER MULTILPLE TIMES A DAY AND ALL I WANT TO TO IS TALK TO HER OR BE WITH HER.  But I still love my current gf, I think.

I'm a 22 year old guy, and while over the years I've had lots of awesome experiences with women, I'm starting to feel that I'll never have the deep and meaningful connection with a woman that I'm looking for.
I've had plenty of sexual relationships over the years (around 20 or so), but I've never had the type of connection that I've always wanted. I've tried many things, thinking that maybe it's a problem with me. I've abstained from having any kind of sexual encounter during the early stages of dating, thinking that by doing that, I could be less distracted and more into the girl that I'm seeing. I've tried dating people outside of whom I'd normally see, and no matter what I do I just can't seem to make a deep connection with anyone.

I know that many will say that I'm still very young, and that I should be patient, but I was wondering if anyone had anything else to add.

To complicate things, I am a very intimate person, and love sex and being close to girls... but at this point I'm just kind of at a loss for what I should do. Should I just wait the 10+ years it may take to find that special woman and abstain from sex?

My girlfriend of almost 3 years dumped me after this last summer vacation ended (she took a 3 week trip back to her home after her internship ended). I know some people will throw around the phrase ""out of the blue,"" but I can't imagine a more apt description. She started the conversation by saying ""so, do you want to talk about our relationship."" There wasn't a fight, it was how I imagine being laid off from a job would be. Other memorable quotes are ""I just don't see the point of having sex with only you knowing it's going to end in a year,"" and ""well I haven't been with that many people."" I don't remember exactly how it was worded but she said she wanted to still be friends with benefits with me. I refused.

It's been a crappy time trying to get over her, I was totally depressed and wasn't eating, every time I saw her it felt like my guts shifted and I wanted to vomit. My friends have commented on her outfits going to parties on Facebook (so I end up seeing it inadvertently), and it's very obvious what she's been looking to do, and that has made me feel worse.

So fast forward to 2 nights ago. I don't know what got into me but I took her up on her offer. I thought maybe just a one-nighter kind of thing would help me feel better, maybe add some physical closure to the situation so I stop having guttural reactions when I see her (or maybe just desperate to get laid). It actually worked, I don't feel nearly as crappy as I did, but now I'm completely confused. The sex we had wasn't the semi-callous doing whatever turned us on sex that I thought it'd be, it was insanely passionate love-making, ranked among the best we've ever had (I'm one of the romantics that distinguishes between sex and making love), during which I could tell from the feel that she hadn't been getting laid either. But, she didn't want me to leave afterwards, she tried to get me to cuddle and was kissing me non-stop, more so that she did when we were together (to the point where it could be called clingy).

So here's the source of my confusion. We're both new to the concept of sex-buddies but I'm pretty damn sure that's now how things are supposed to go. She tries to treat me like a friend in public (the 2 times we've seen each other in public), and behind closed doors and under the covers she's treating me like her boyfriend again. I have no idea what to think of this. Does it mean she still has feelings for me? Does she want to be a swinger or something? Should I set up emotional boundaries to prevent getting hurt (again)?

For me, the sex is relieving, I've made more progress towards getting over her in the last 2 days than I have in the last 2 months because of it, and because of that I don't want to stop, but I don't think it's a good idea to keep going along with the emotional things she wants to do in addition, like cuddle or hang out afterwards.

**tl;dr** Dumped by ex out of nowhere, felt like crap. She wanted to be sex buds, I tried it. It was awesome, I felt loads better but there's no way what we did was what sex buds do.

I was in a relationship for 7.5 years.  We were together from 14 to 22 and things were up and down.  But I did love him.  He was my first everything, my best friend.  We broke up because I had what I would call a breakdown.  I treated him terribly and started acting like a dick.  This acting like a dick period (not just towards him) lasted from December of last year to early August of this year.  We officially broke up in April, but we have worked to stay friends, particularly since mid September of this year.

In that 8-9 month period, I broke up with him, slept with someone almost immediately (feel like I cheated since we were long distance and he thought we were still working things out), had a one night stand, hooked up with girl (cheated on him again since we were actually working on things), and got involved with a man in a LTR.  I am very disappointed in myself and all of my actions have made me question love as a concept.  How could I hurt someone (my ex) so badly if I loved him?  How could someone who said they loved their girlfriend get so involved (physcially and emotionally) with me?  How could I get involved with someone knowing they ""loved"" another? What do I actually value about love?

On top of all this, I had a pretty shitty example of love growing up.  My parents talked about how they loved each other but they fought constantly and my dad walked out a couple of times (never actually left, but him up and leaving after huge arguments certainly made an impression).  In my long relationship, I was unnecessarily dramatic a lot of the time because in my head I thought that fighting was a part of love since that's what I grew up with.  (I know better now).

My dad committed suicide a few years ago (his business had failed and he saw it as the last thing he could do to protect my family from ruin) and this has also left me struggling to figure out love.  I don't know.  It just has stopped making sense to me.  I knew what it felt like to ""be in love"" with my ex-boyfriend.  But I don't know what love is to me now.  We are still friends and he says that the only reason he has been able to stay friends with me after I went nuts is because he loves me.  And I don't know what love is to me at all.

I am dating someone new and I like him a lot, but me feeling so cynical (if that's even the right word) about love is starting to freak me out a little.  I don't know what I'm supposed to feel.  And I feel bad because it's not like I don't know what love is, but that was high school sweetheart love and my first love, and I know it won't be the same.

I know asking ""what is love"" is a huge question.  I'm just feeling sad about where my views on it have gone.

I have serious anger problems which only manifest about once every half a year. I realized this pattern yesterday, when I lashed out at two people disrespecting me in front of a huge group. One of them was my friend; turned out he didn't even do it, but I lashed out at him until I found out it was the other one.

The thought at the time was that I had to assert my dominance (sounds stupid, and like I just read some PUA garbage. I haven't.) By that I mean I was being disrespected, and that I wanted it to stop. That's the furthest I can get into my thought process.


I could literally feel the anger coarsing through my veins. The thing is, it doesn't happen often so when I'm on the six month comedown from my anger fest I feel like I'm not an angry person. I'll tell myself ""I'm not an angry person"", until that time comes around again and then I'm forced to introspect.

I know it's from my father, but knowing the cause doesn't really change anything. If anything it means I'm determined to be this way as long as I live.

Please help?

Oh. If it helps, I'll add that I used to hurt myself and I have permanent bruises (I think...) on my thighs from hitting myself so often.
I used to just break shit all the time - Throw CD cases, break apart CD's, rip apart books, whatever.
I really try not to do that anymore (after typing that I remember I did it again two years ago!), but I guess it just means I scream at people instead of objects.

Shit, I'm fucked up.

We’ve been dating for around 2 months but have been officially together for 1. We are both freshmen in college and neither of us has had a serious relationship before. He told me rather soon after we met that before me, he has never been in any sort of relationship with a girl. A couple of weeks ago, he said “I love you” for the first time and to be honest, it sort of took me by surprise. At the time I wasn’t ready to say it back but eventually I did about a week later.

The fact is that he is good-looking, intelligent, a gentleman and an all-round great guy. Multiple friends (both mine and his) have told me how lucky I am and that he’s a “perfect catch”. He has been amazing and never made me want for much or want him to change in any way. He’s never given me any reason to doubt him. However, I’m terrified that he could just dump me at any moment for another girl. It’s as if I don’t feel good enough for him. Just last night I dreamt that I caught him cheating on me.

It’s frustrating because my friends tell me I’m a great friend, I’m loyal and outgoing, guys tell me that they find me rather physically attractive, I’m somewhat intelligent, have good hygiene and generally nothing repulsive about me that might scare anyone away. Many people have also told me that I come across as much more mature than my age which is why I feel as if I’m going crazy because I’m usually clear-headed and sensible.

Part of me really wants to be in a loving committed relationship my boyfriend but another part of me wants to run as fast as I can in the opposite direction to avoid falling head over heels for him and avoid getting seriously hurt later. I haven’t talked to him about my insecurities for fear of scaring him away. I also make a conscious effort to not come across as a jealous, possessive maniac because I’m afraid I might turn into one.

Some part of my insecurities might be due to my parents’ messy divorce. My parents were married for about 20 years until my mom found out last year that my dad had been cheating on her with multiple women for the past 5 years (and possibly even longer). I think  having to console my distraught mom about how my dad didn’t give a shit about her could have caused me to be wary about serious relationships and question commitment a lot. I’ve also seen a few close friends get hurt badly in relationships recently.

Apologies for the terribly long ramble.

TL;DR - Insecure and paranoid about being dumped by wonderful boyfriend and getting hurt.

Am I going crazy? Is there something wrong with me? How can I overcome this overwhelming insecurity and just generally feel more comfortable with everything? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Today he ""liked"" a picture on my Facebook wall and it got me thinking if I should contact him or not just as a friendly gesture. It's nothing sexual, we are both guys (22), we were just friends. I'm posting here because I don't know if there is a forum for friend-issues.

Following reasons why I had to cut off our friendship:

1. We shared the same nationality, played the same sports, but in terms of attitude, beliefs and philosophy on life we were different... explained further...

2. He grew up in a strict household, naturally he wasn't sensitive to anyone else's feelings, even his little brother who he physically abused until I intervened which turned things sour. His strict religious father was part of his faults, even though he used to always tell me he wanted to leave the house ASAP.

3. His father was a former government agent in the middle east (can't disclose nationality for privacy reasons), and my father was a former prisoner who escaped. When I found out these 2 facts 5 years ago I immediately stopped contacting him. It was very painful, but it wasn't just for me it was also for my dad.

So in conclusion his family was a danger to mine. But I can't deny that we shared some good times together, I wish politics and his darker side (from his father) never existed because aside from that he will always be my best friend even though I haven't spoken a word to him in 5 years.

So should I say something on his Facebook wall? Ever since I cut it off our friendship hes been confused and extremely pissed. We live far away from each other so it hasn't been hard ignoring him. I feel extremely awkward saying anything to him even on Facebook, deep inside he isn't a terrible person, he was just raised in a horrible family. He lives on his own now with his girlfriend downtown, I have my own life. But all those years we spent together as kids can't be erased, right now I am planning to continue ignore him even though it's heart wrenching, is it the right thing to do? Or should I just awkwardly ask him how life is? He lives on his own now, so I'm not afraid to contact him, it would just seem extremely awkward.

**TL;DR:** Basically lifelong friendship had to end because of political reasons, 5 years on without any contact, and a lot of anger/confusion between us is it right to say something?

It is this single incident that I believe has led to the inability to have a *meaningful* romantic relationship with a girl since. 

I think that whenever I start to get close to a girl I put up these barriers and distance myself from them as a kind of defense mechanism to prevent this thing from happening again, even though it was 10 years ago. I'm shy after a certain point. I can talk a girl up at the bar and get a number fairly easy without having to ask for it and even go home with a few of them, but this isn't what I'm looking for here, particularly because alcohol is always involved and its something I am giving up.

I'm a 19 year-old guy who just started university and there's the thing:
It's a third week into the course and all the freshers managed to get into one or another 'pack of friends' as I call it (you definitely know that I mean). I ended up in one of them (sort of) mainly due to people doing the same course as me or something. The thing is that I really don't have anything to talk about with these people. If we meet it's mostly because we left the lecture room together and go together to someone's room, or we met at the canteen and then proceed to have some drinks afterwards. But I feel that for them I could as well not be there. And I'm not really surprised why. I mean, all the others from the pack seem to be getting really close together and that makes me feel just more and more out of place. I feel like a fifth wheel.

""So why don't you find some new people to hang out with?"" I hear you ask.

Well, it's the thing that I mentioned already. People have gotten into 'packs' already. Me trying to suddenly jump into one of those (group people who, again, are already moderately close) would just feel incredibly awkward, even more so because of my absolute lack of skill in the thing called 'small talk' (in addition I'm foreign so even though I don't have any problems with English, still it can make the initial conversation even harder). Also, what makes the thing even worse is the fact that basically all the social life in here is centred around 'colleges', who are not that big. My one has about 100 freshers, which means that I talked to many of them at some point and that they probably know me already as this 'awkward and boring conversation guy' (because of the small talk stuff).

You'll probably say to try some university-wide societies or something. The thing is that even if I get to know some people form there, they'll never be the people I spend time with regularly, because surely they have their own, closer friends in their colleges...

Please help :(,badfriendsmaybe,6,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/kogqv/am_i_a_bad_person_or_have_i_chosen_bad_friends/,"Ok reddit, I'm having some issues with my friends stemming from my new(ish) relationship. I need to ask someone outside the situation what they think is going on here.

I'm 21 and female, my 2 closest friends are 21, one straight girl (""F"") and one gay guy (""M"")

Brief history for background: I've always been reserved and awkward and had trouble making friends. I tend to form really intense friendships with one or two people and don't really have any casual friends. The trouble is after a year or so of extremely close friendship I start to realize my friends are domineering and manipulative and I feel frequently attacked for doing or saying anything the friend doesn't like or agree with. Eventually I'm told I've changed, I'm not what they thought I was or what I used to be, etc. Pretty much this exact situation has happened, with my oldest childhood/teenage friend and with my current best female friend (we've been close for 4/5 years.) 

Early in 2010 I broke up with my then-boyfriend of 3 years who I had a very consuming but crappyI relationship with but sadly decided to cling to because I didn't want to be alone. It felt so good to be free and I had no other relationships to focus on so I spent tons of time with F and M, basically all my free time as I was roomies with M and next door to F. F has had a rocky relationship with her boyfriend and M has no trouble making friends but can't tseem to find a boyfriend. We decided to have a crazy summer together where we said yes to everything, had adventures, smoked lots of trees (and tried some new drugs as well) and just generally went crazy and had fun. I sluttted it up quite a bit which DROVE F TO TEARS because this was so strange and offensive to her that she ""didn't know who I was anymore."" She said she wasn't sure if we could even be friends, what was I thinking,  etc etc. I was really hurt but didn't want to lose a friend so I ignored it and she got overit. 
The summer of debauchery takes its toll on M , he's drinking heavily, loses his job but continues to spend money on drugs and booze. I, full time student with a part time job, get stuck paying all ir most of the rent and utilities and we are without water or electricity towardsa the end of our lease because im too embarrasses to ask anyone for help. 

Then in the fall of last year I met my current (awesome) boyfriend who encourages me to be more responsible, scale back my drug and alcohol use, quit smoking cigarettes, all things normally considered positive changes in a persons life but which my friends take as a personal affront. They accuse me of judging them when I turn down pot or other drugs, tell me I'm neglecting them and treating them like shit because I spend most nights (and a lot of my free time, admittedly) with the new bf. Meanwhile roomie M is making only the most half assed attempts at job hunting and our apt has no running water or electricity.

I understand theirconcern over my changing my behavior because of a guy, but all of the changes have had a positive effect on my health, finances, grades, etc, and I still do a toned down version of the things I used to do with my friends. Our relationship just feels broken now and I can't get over how critical and harsh they acted instead of being happy that I found something good. M still owes me money and never offers to pay me back aside from occasionally buying my drinks if we go out. I didn't keep a record of what he owed me because I felt bad for him, he was obviously depressed and having problems with his family, but I know its at least a couple hundred dollars. 

Should I try to move on from these friendships? Do they sound toxic to you guys? My boyfriend says yes but I have no other friends and have invested so much in these... and I'm a little afraid what they've said about me is right. Please give some advice. I can offer more details if it will help, although I've already written a novel here... sorry. 

rl;dr- friends say I've changed drastically and ditched them for the new bf. I say I've improved,  but I don't have as much time for them and am not interested in being perpetually fucked up.

How can I fix my attitude about this?

====

I'm a 24 year old female and I feel I have some deep issues, particularly surrounding trust with my boyfriend, as well as about porn and masturbation.

Growing up I never had any issues with porn or masturbation, though I didn't engage/utilize either I knew it was considered the norm to and didn't look down on the activity. In fact the thought of a man masturbating was a major turn on for me.

I met my boyfriend online over two years ago.  We skyped and chatted, including phone sex and the like.  I knew he masturbated and we even discussed porn together and I wasn't bothered at all.

He moved to my city and we've been living together since May of 2010. (He's 22 years old now.) After a while we began to have sex less often, I chalked it up to ""settling in"" and the new relationship getting into a more relaxed norm.

After a few months of living together at one point I woke up and walked into the living room to find him masturbating.  He didn't notice me and I left the room.  When I asked him about it later he denied he'd been masturbating.

Ever since then I've had an irrational negative feeling towards porn and masturbation, particularly when my boyfriend is involved.  Though my rational mind knows it is not the case I can't help but feel almost cheated on when I think about him watching porn and masturbating instead of having sex with me.

I've gone into literal anxiety attacks over this. In an effort to calm me down he promised me he wouldn't look at porn (which I feel like crap about, depriving him when I know it's **my** issue that I know I need to deal with) but then I found out he was just looking at porn behind my back.  Ever since then I don't trust him and just assume he's lying and doing things behind my back, making me feel even worse about it all.

I've talked to him about it many times but I can think of no way to fix my issues.  My rational mind constantly tells me that porn and masturbation is normal, particularly for young men, but the very idea of it just makes my skin crawl and upsets me on a very deep level.

How can I overcome how much I despise the idea of my boyfriend viewing porn and masturbating?

(Just a last note since I imagine people may recommend it: I do not like watching porn and would be very uncomfortable if we watched it together, so I don't think that would be a good idea and would probably give me more of a negative feeling towards porn.)

Edited to Add for Clarification: I'm afraid in the interest of brevity I cut the issue down and may have given the wrong impression; I do not personally believe he views porn particularly often, nor does he need it to masturbate. (When I walked in on him he was not looking at porn, for example.) My issues seem to be centered around ""solo activities of a sexual nature,"" such as masturbation, porn, or both at the same time.

He is not viewing porn or masturbating often (unless he's **very** good at hiding it) but the thought of him doing so upsets me terribly and that is my issue. That he masturbates or looks at porn, or even the fact he has the desire to do either, upsets me and I know that's not a rational emotion over something, particularly something I've never had an issue with before now. I realize this is an issue with me, not with him, and it's overcoming that issue that I would like to do.",,False,,t5_2s90u,True,,,True,t3_k5529,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/k5529/i_have_issues_with_porn_masturbation_and_trusting/,

All I want to do is get to know like-minded, possibly attractive gay people around my age that don't see me as a piece of meat.

I have profiles setup on local websites other young adults use in the area. I participate in allot of local activities and have a wide circle of friends.

When-ever I meet someone hopeful I ask from the start ""what would you like to-do""? - then I play dumb to see what kind of answer they give back to me. 99% are along these lines: ""Oh ;) well I want to kiss you and hold and caress your body"". The answer I was looking for: ""I want to go for a walk with you and talk about X because we both find it interesting"".

If I tell them I'm not interested in sexual advances and just wanted to get to know someone as a friend for a long-time first they agree that is a great idea ...and then on the first or second date they are obviously trying exceedingly hard to get in my pants. Its really fucking annoying.

Long term relationship I was 100% committed to ended roughly a year ago. 

In the following months I feel I've completely gotten over my ex. 

Tried dating a few times: hated it.

Not just the dates ... *the entire process* of meeting women and dating. 
I hate the dating *scene*. 

.

I'm lonely ... *I want to be with someone*.  (No interest in casual sex.)

But I can't muster the time and effort required for the process I don't seem to enjoy.   
I also feel like this bad feeling about dating in general is going to sabotage any efforts I do make. 

It seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
If I don't enjoy dating in general then how could I even HAVE a good date?

-------

**Long version:**

A lot of background to cover because I suspect it's important:

Straight male, mid to late twenties, close to a year out of a very serious 4 year relationship.  

During the final year of that relationship I noticed a personal change ... my brain ***locked*** into the relationship.  I was completely happy, completely content, and I honestly felt I would spend the rest of my life with that girl.

And that was exactly what I wanted. 



Fast-forward a few months later:
The relationship is suddenly dying ... she's distant ... alarm bells going off ... etc.

I confront her about it and this seems to be the tipping point.  

Facing her behavior, she comes to realize she wants out of the relationship.  

All of my plans and expectations come falling down like a house of cards. 



Fast-forward just a little more and I discover she's dating one of my friends.
A friend who she had been hanging out with a lot towards the end of our relationship. 

I don't know if she cheated or not ... but at this point I think it's wasted energy to even think about it.

The relationship is over. 



It takes me a while to be confident that I was completely over her but I get there.

No romantic interest left, not even attracted to her anymore. 

.

After about 5-6 months I tried meeting women and dating again. 

It was a disaster. 

.

I hated it ... every part of it.  

On the dates I went on I ended up pretending to have fun just so I didn't make them feel bad. 

I just didn't feel into it.  I didn't *care*. 

.

Worst Instance:
Over the course of three dates ... 

(I was trying to force myself to open up with a girl that should have been a good fit.)

... the vibes I got from one girl went from *""I'm waiting for you to jump me.""* to *""I resent you for not making the slightest move.""*
In the end I ended up feeling like an ass for wasting so much of her time. 

.

And it's more than just bad dates.
I feel jaded about the whole process of meeting women. 
Everything about dating sites just feels fake ... no one is honest about anything. 
I hate the whole ... *bar* ... thing.  I have no desire to go buy drinks for the opportunity to make pointless smalltalk with a woman that is either there for a one night stand or to get free drinks. 

.

So, setting the whole *""meeting people""* industry aside, the only thing I feel comfortable with is naturally meeting people and becoming friends.  

Unfortunately, that's just not going to happen.

*I work in an environment with no women under the age of 40. 

*I don't have any opportunities to meet women in my normal routine.

*I would feel too awkward to randomly approach someone at the store or something.   (Is that even socially acceptable?  In the real world outside of romantic comedies it seems like a good way to be labeled creepy.)

***How can I meet someone like this?***
 
I did run into *one* girl I would have loved to date.
A friend from college who I had actually been interested in years ago.  Now she works very close to where I live. 
We chatted several times and we have have very similar interests so my head was in the clouds.
TBH let myself get too excited even though I knew better. 
It's just ... at the time it seemed like the perfect girl showed up in the perfect place at the perfect time.  

She turned me down of course.  

.

So ... I'm now in a place where I feel like I'm left with no options to meet women outside of the the *dating scene* which I absolutely don't enjoy.  And, of course, that's just doomed to end in failure anyway *because of my hangups.*

",vigrin,6,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/jid8b/im_27_a_virgin_and_never_been_in_a_relationship/,"TL;DR:  I'm 27.  I'm a virgin.  I get social anxiety, and situational awareness anxiety that leads to apathy about the situation, which leads to more anxiety, etc...   I don't really know what to do.

Sorry, the rest is sort of a book and may be incoherent, but it's nice to get it all out because nobody knows this all, although a few best friends know about 75% of it (I have so much anxiety about the whole relationship thing I can't even tell my best friends everything)

So, I moved a lot starting in middle school.  Like... a lot.  4 different cities, and 6+ schools in 4 years.  The reasons for moving are irrelevant, but I didn't have much friends in that time period.  I didn't hang out with anyone my age between 9th and 11th grades.  I  eventually made a few friends and the few friends that left town right after high school.  Needless to say, I didn't date in high school.

My first first real date I actually had was a girl that was always friendly to me in school and I was probably too stupid to realize she was interested in me ( one of those girls when I was about 21.  She liked me, it freaked me the fuck out and I just withdrew and didn't go on another date.  A year or two later I went on a couple of dates with a friend's younger sister, and met two people on CL for coffee once.  It was alright, we had fun, and she was cute.  She came over to a party at my house.  She tried to kiss/make out with me when she was really drunk (I was sober), and I was like freaking out again, and didn't do anything back, and she just left the room.  (I saw her 4 months after that and she was 3 months pregnant, and engaged to some other guy I found out she was dating at the same time, so I don't feel so bad about that)  Lots of school in the meantime meant further lack of a social life and increased apathy toward relationships.

Fast forward past college graduation, and I ended up moving to a new city about 7 months ago.  I actually made a new best friend here that's a girl... and after hanging out tons (3 or 4 nights one week) I asked her 'out, like on a date'.  I had so much anxiety from the text that I actually passed out after a minute of overdrive heartbeats.  I woke up to a friend zone text.  I kind of hate that more than being alone honestly.  I can't not hang out with her, and I think I love her, but I don't want to get hung up on either, so I just try to move on, but it's hard because we *both* enjoy each others time.  I'm not very good at making new friends, but I'm still lonely too, so this tends to lead my toward a path of apathy towards meeting new people, which is exactly what I don't want.

This led me to Okcupid.  I had one not so great date a few months ago, so I basically abandoned it. This led to further apathy, but I eventually got back on again a month ago, talked to another girl, texted for a few days and met up for drinks.  We met at a busy (brightly lit) bar, and she brought her friend, and we drank, and she got pretty drunk.  I drank to kill anxiety.  Eventually, she apparently thought I was cute and ended up grabbing my head and shoving her tongue in my mouth, and we kind of made out for 15 minutes in front of her friend and lots of people at a bar.  My first kiss: people were talking about us while it was happening, I had hover hands, I kind of wanted to stop but didn't know how, etc... Eventually we stopped and her friend took her home.  We texted the next two days, and then we were busy, then I texted a few times after trying to go to dinner actually meet this person instead of drinking, but she kind of abandoned ship for whatever reason, which is actually fine by me.

So, at least I finally have the first kiss hurdle down, and I'm trying to ride that wave of success on, but I'm getting more and more anxiety of thinking about the next steps.  Part of me wants to just get it over with with some random girl I'll never see again (not a prostitute though) but given my personality I don't really see that happening.  A bigger part of me wants to find a nice girl, go on a few dates and try to explain it, but I just don't know if I can beat that anxiety, and that anxiety gets worse with time.

Anyone that knows me in real life thinks that I’m absolutely fine. I don’t like to burden others with my issues because everyone has their own problems. 

I’m 21, white (looking but mixed race), 5’6 around 145 lbs and I have a plethora of issues that I honestly don’t think a lot of people have had to deal with.

I grew up the youngest of four with 2 older sisters (30, 29) and an older brother (26) in a household with helicopter parents. My sisters are, while not without some problems, pretty much perfect. Both married their high school sweet hearts, graduated from college without issues, had good grades, weren’t ever questioning of my parents, considered beautiful blah blah blah. My brother was amazing at sports, probably the best artist I’ve ever seen and is one of the laziest, and rudest people I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. He is always right; he never says anything different than how he thinks he said something. He knows what other people mean to say, what other people should be focusing on, and if you disagree then fuck you. He’s getting… better… but he’s still a dick, saying that he used to be an even bigger cunt in the past just means he was worse then. 

Strangers / Family friends would always make comments about my family, how attractive my sisters were, how handsome my brother was, how we had such a beautiful family. I just wanted to be the one complimented a few times when I was younger. 

Anyways my brother’s issues got worse, he got into drugs (Nothing hardcore like meth or heroine but still at the time smoking pot seemed like a big deal) and in high school when my parents were trying to help by trying anti-depressents/ADD/ADHD medicine (That he never took properly and to this day blames my parents for making things worse doing this) and going to counseling sessions that he would charismatically make my parents look like the bad guys and that he was this normal teen with a few rebellious issues and that they were overreacting. My brother handles every situation by getting machismo aggressive, never admitting he’s wrong and then starts throwing a fucking moody.

My mother never wants any of us to leave the nest, and as such both my sisters visit at least once a month and talk pretty much daily. My brother is living at home with his girlfriend, their 3 year old son, and have another baby boy on the way. He’s not working, and is still going to school (It’s only been… 8 years and he doesn’t have an associates degree.) His girlfriend isn’t much better than he is, pretty much his female counterpart. They’re awful people and I feel bad for my nephew. My parents cover everything for the two of them. 

My dad was a great father to me when I was a child but over time we never had anything to bond over and besides for him BEING my dad, and my mother was too overprotective to the point where if I was going outside I had to ask for permission to walk a block away from the house. I just stopped playing outside eventually. 

Besides my family I really didn’t have many close friends growing up. All of my close friends growing up were girls and I was excluded from activities that they did because I was a boy. I just wanted friends, I didn’t care if they were playing house or dressup instead of freeze tag. My parents used to get mad at me for spending all day playing video games or reading but I didn’t know what else to do. I didn’t have any freedom in my house so I never felt comfortable even talking on the phone in front of my family. To this day I don’t like talking on the phone in front of other people, which is silly I know.

As such I had no friends that I could hang out with, I hated my brother, and quite frankly my parents never really focused on me, and the times that they did I didn’t WANT them to, and I idealized my sisters, and since my family was focusing on all of my brothers issues or what minor problems my sisters had I kind of just slipped by. 

Time went on and I realized that it was just easier to lie about everything. I lied about school and friends to my family because I didn’t want my mother’s intervention, and I didn’t want to waste any of their time when they had bigger and more important things to focus on. I just dealt with school and classes until I could come home and get on my parents computer. I spent most of my time even alone on the internet. Oh god, I feel awful about things I've seen, said or thought.

Teachers would complain to my parents about me not doing all my work, but I was getting B’s and C’s. I just didn't care to do the work like coloring maps, I thought it was pointless and would complain about it all the time. The only attention I ever really got was when I would be when trying to argue. I was put in GT programs back in Elementary school but I feel like that just ostracized me from my peers even more. I was picked on for being the kid that knew the answer kind of thing. That got worse until it was about everything, I just remember zoning out for most of my childhood. It was awful at home just between arguments or bickering, hassle over such trivial things. I still remember one day in 5th grade when I just counted the number of insults thrown my way during a single lunch/recess. It was over 200. 

This was my life for years. Pretty much 3rd grade through my Senior year of high school. I was socially awkward, had no friends, felt alone, depressed, never achieved anything in school because I was surrounded by people that didn’t care that I did know it anyways and as much as I hated my life I never would have killed myself just because I realized I could tolerate my pain for the sake of my sisters/parents. I never excelled at sports the way my brother did either. I just felt frustrated because I felt that for as awful as he was that my family genuinely loved him more.

Years passed of thinking that college would be better, that I'd get away. And it has been but now the freedom that I have has just caused me to look more at myself and how worthless I am. I almost with a degree in something that will never help me get a job, I have no skills. I can’t speak another language, I don’t know any programming languages, I can’t play an instrument, I’m self conscious about how I look. 

I feel ugly. I have a false idealization of thinking I'll only be attractive if I'm fitter and less hairy. And I feel like an even bigger idiot because as a guy I don't feel like I can ever really bring this up or even know what to do about it.

Fuck I just feel behind about everything. I don’t know how to cook, I don’t have money and I can’t find a job, I don’t even have my own computer which is awful because really it’s the only thing that keeps me sane. Why the fuck would a girl even want to be with me?  I just… I’m tired of writing all of this.

I’ve had sex twice. Both times drunk, and the one time something almost kinda happened when I was sober I couldn’t get it up. 

I feel useless.

I feel like I shouldn’t have been born to be honest. I wish I hadn’t rather. I didn’t grow up in a slum, I’m not an orphan and I feel bad about FEELING BAD since my issues aren’t as bad as so much of the worlds. I’ve gone through so much pain and so little happiness that I actually feel bad about the fact that in a life that I had so much more than others I’m not a better person. 

No one I know would ever think any of this is true for me. After all, my degree is in Acting so on the day to day I have my game face on / mask up and I’m glad that no one can tell.

She was my first girlfriend that I had in several years, and being the naive guy I was at the time, I thought it would be all sunshine and rainbows, but I was met with a rude awakening when she turned out to become emotionally abusive, manipulative, and a general, all-around bitch to not only me, but to my friends as well. More often than not she would be complaining and talking down on me, telling me things like how I was a pathetic excuse for a man, and bringing down my sense of self esteem.

To add to this mix, she had suicidal tendencies. There were times in our relationship when she would lock herself in the bathroom after she'd fight with me, and contemplate ODing on any pills that were in the washroom at the time, leaving me helpless and worried on the other side. Another instance, she threatened to hurt herself with a knife while I stood there watching in horror, not knowing what to do but to just pray to whatever entity I could think of at the time. Every time she did something like this, she'd apologize for her behaviour and say she wouldn't do it again and that she needed me. I felt like I was in a trap - being talked down on, but not being able to leave in fear that it would push her over the edge to doing something drastic to herself.

After a few months of us dating, it was clear to my friends that I wasn't very happy with life, and that this girl was bad for me. My girlfriend caught wind of this and told me she wasn't cool with me hanging with my friends (who were clearly just concerned for my well-being), which put an even bigger strain on our already toxic relationship. All of this built up into one occurrence of us trying to get into a club downtown that my friends were at, but with her ultimately declining when she learned my friends were inside, and me crying in the streets, wondering if there was any way out of this mess.

The following day, she noticed that I was acting a bit cold towards her, which pushed her almost to the edge. She decided to take a shower and come out in her bathrobe, yelling at me and asking why I've changed so much since we first started dating. She then came to the conclusion that she had ""left the old me back in the streets of downtown"", and ran out of my apartment during wintertime (still in nothing but the bathrobe) to the bus station, asking any strangers on the way there if they had ""seen her old boyfriend"". I managed to bring her back in eventually, only to be greeted with more threats of suicide by a knife. I didn't know if she was serious about this, but I was NOT about to test her on that. This was the single most terrifying thing that has happened in my life to this day - having the feeling of truly not knowing what to do while your supposed ""girlfriend"" stands there with a knife in her hand, knowing that if I screwed up with anything that I said, she may take her own life. Thankfully, she was bluffing, but I'm still terribly familiar with that feeling she gave me the feeling of being utterly hopeless.

A few weeks later, she actually broke up with me, saying that she didn't think things were going to work out between us. She then proceeded to blame me for everything that went wrong in the relationship, and bit my arm in anger, a mark that would only disappear a year later. I was very happy we weren't together anymore and felt free, but I still felt a feeling of dread and worthlessness inside.

We broke up 4 years ago, so why am I bringing this up now? Well, I had just seen her last night at a party and I thought it was going to be okay since it's been so long, but seeing her brought back the same dread and terrible memories that I've tried so hard to forget. To this day, I still feel shitty about everything. The worst part is that I actually believed her in how everything was my fault, and that it was because of me that she ended up being a psychotic nutjob. My experience with her made me lose faith in myself, making me think that I'll turn every girl I get involved with into someone like her, and that maybe I was destined to be alone. After 4 years of seeing other women, therapy, contemplating suicide, antidepressants, and attempting to get my life back together, I am disappointed in myself for not being able to move past this, and am bringing it to reddit to see if you guys have any advice to offer.

So, for most of my life I haven't been able to touch anyone without at least some anxiety. This includes friends and family. I can't even hug my mother without hesitating. 

 I'm to the point where I'll go out of my way to avoid even the most casual of contact. If I'm walking down the hall and someone is headed in the other direction, I'll hug the wall, even if there is plenty of room. It's pretty noticeable and people have commented on it. Most think it's funny, I'm a six foot tall, 220 pound guy and I jump out of the way like I'm going to be mowed down. Some take offence, nobody likes being treated like a leper. 

You can imagine what this does to any relationship I might hope to have. I've had women basically throw themselves at me and I just can't. I've dated a few times, and it's never gone well. Normally it doesn't last much after things start to get physical. I'm cool with the rest of it, but when the door closes and the lights go down, I'm a wreck. To be honest, I've gone pro a few times in the past, just so I could have a partner that didn't care that I was a flinching, twitchy mess. I've pretty much abandoned any hope of ever having a normal relationship. Even in my imagination I just picture how horribly it will end. 

I've maintained a long distance relationship with someone for the last three years. It's not really a real relationship, and I know it. It amounts to me taking care of her, while she pretends to be there for me. It's the best I've got, even a fake relationship is better than no relationship at all. And at least I'll never have to worry about anything physical with her.

I'm 20. Male.

I have what I assume is fairly severe separation anxiety. If I don't talk to someone important, like a best friend or romantic partner for a day or so, I don't assume we both just got busy and nothing happened with us. I assume something's wrong. Either that I upset them, or that they just don't care about me as much as I do them, or they found someone else they'd rather have as a friend/boyfriend, or SOMETHING. I assume a lack of contact to be the worst thing.

This leads to two things:

One, I get clingy. I think, ""If I hold on to them, they can't vanish for a day, signifying the end of the world."" This is clearly an AWFUL idea, because then you hold on too tightly, and then they actually do want out for a bit.

Two, I feel like I need to always be available. Since I feel like they should be within reach, I need to be too. Any time without a phone or FB is time they could want to talk to me, but think I've got better things to do than talk to them. Which leads me to sit there and be available, and of course they aren't always there, so if they go so long without showing up, I think I'm being avoided or don't matter enough to them for them to try and find me for 5 minutes.

None of this is healthy. How do I get out of this? If I step back, I can see it's all insanely irrational, but whenever it's dealing with person X that I really really care about I lose all rational thought.

(Although this concerns my relationship, I posted it in ihaveissues because I think the deeper issue is with ME, not the relationship.)

I got married at 19 (after a 2-year relationship). The marriage lasted 6 years before I began having emotional breakdowns and health issues that led to me leaving him. I spent the time after that living alone and trying to figure out my shit. I was extremely emotionally screwed up for months, made some poor decisions, and slunk into a kind of manic depressive state for a short while. 

Eventually I began to heal and I got a lot stronger. I was making progress in my career and I went back to school. I was focusing on bettering myself, and although I got stuck with some ridiculous health problems for 10 months during that time, I still overcame and began to get a lot healthier. I felt I was finally stable and strong again in all aspects.


Then (about a year and a half ago, 2 years after I left the husband) I met and fell in love with my current boyfriend. Things started out great, we were strong and in love and connected so well.


But then something changed. I started having bad mood swings, where I would get super emotional and be crying and very upset about things. He would be concerned and try to help but he said that I was being irrational (and the frustrating part was that I KNEW I was being irrational sometimes, but couldn't stop myself). He would want to stop talking about issues before I felt they were resolved, etc.


Okay, point being... here were now, a year down the line from when I became more emotional. I seem unable to handle emotional situations (even though I DO think I am getting better at it) but he seems to have completely shut down about them (like he is just exhausted with it because I get emotional so often). He thinks that I revisit issues too much or want to talk about issues for too much time and that bothers him. I feel like he just wants to push issues aside and wants me to instantly be happy. I told him I need MORE. I keep revisiting issues or being upset by the same things because we never find any resolutions to these problems when they arise.


I just... Reddit, I don't know what to do. I feel like I've collapsed into this emotional basketcase, and when I have emotions I feel guilty because I know it bothers him (which only makes my emotional state WORSE). How do I deal with this? How do I overcome my emotional issues and work through them? Especially when he won't talk them through with me and help me find solutions? I've told him I think I need to see a therapist and he finally agreed that it would be fine (as long as it's just me, not a couples therapist, heh). But the problem is that I can't afford one. I am supporting the both of us while he is in school, and I'm struggling to pay the bills and feed us every month. 


What do I do? I feel like I am just fucking over my relationship because I get upset/emotional too easily, but I don't know how to STOP getting so emotional. He says that I'm a different person than I was when he met me. He says that it was so attractive how I was strong and confident and all that stuff, and I'm not like that anymore. We can't pinpoint anything specific that caused this change in me. It's killing me, and I'm afraid it's killing my relationship. :(

I've had a ton of issues, both as a person and in my relationships, and a lot of people on here have good advice. Reading so many peoples stories has given me sort of an epiphany:

I (25f) was in a relationship with a guy (now 27) for almost eight years. He and I were extremely close. We shared everything. He knew all of my deep dark secrets, and I knew all of his. 

I felt like the relationship we had was one of a kind, the sort of thing all people aspire to, but that no one ever gets. When things started to go bad... I still just kept thinking about how I would never find anyone like this again. I thought if we just worked through the bad, everything would end up perfect. We were so close, how could I ever have anyone like this again? This was my soul mate. He knew me, he understood me.

But we had major issues. The last few years of our relationship were *filled* with fighting, and it was always the same things. *Neither of us treated the other with respect.* **I was miserable.**

In my heart, I think I knew for a while that it had to end, but I repressed that part of me. I thought I was just being pessimistic. But that part of me ended up being right, and in the time it took me to realize that, the two of us went through so much pain, I'm not sure either of us will be quite the same again.

The break up was bad. It was horrible. I thought it would kill at least one of us--and I mean that literally; we both have some issues, and we both thought about suicide at least a little during the breakup.

I've walked a hard road since then--but I walked it, and I keep walking. Since the breakup, I've made a lot of progress on fixing the things that are wrong with me. I am single, and for the first time in my life, that doesn't bother me. I still have issues with depression, but I'm addressing them, and have made so much progress at getting it under control. 

Despite my issues, for the first time ever, I'm actually happy with me. I don't need someone else to make me happy. I know I still have a ways to go, but for the first time, I really feel like I can make it. 

I guess my message is just this: if you're unhappy in a relationship, you probably need to leave. It may be hard, it may seem impossible. You may really really love this person and think that they are the one. But at the end of the day, you need to be happy with you. Always know that you deserve respect, kindness, and love, and if you're not getting that, don't stick around simply because you don't want to be alone. **This relationship that you think is one of a kind, once in a lifetime--it's probably not as special as you think, and you should never let fear stand in the way of happiness.**


**TL;DR: I successfully got out of a relationship with someone who treated me like shit but who I thought was ""the one"". Don't waste as much time as I did realizing what needs to be done. I did it--so can you.**

Here's some background: 24/f, got out of a 4 year relationship 3 years ago, took a year to just do my own thing and be myself and now I would like something serious again. I've never been a ""casual dater"" or friends w/ benefits kind of person - I look for someone I see myself with longterm. A BFF in male-form, if you will. I don't over-think it, I'm the kind of person that likes to let things happen, and if good things are happening, I'll work hard at keeping it going.

It's been a couple of years since I've started trying to meet people and here's what happens:

I meet someone interesting. We click really well. He gets my sense of humour, we can just chill or we can go out, yadda yadda yadda - things are good! I'm excited about talking to him and seeing him and being around him and then it starts, usually at 2 - 3 months:

I get easily annoyed around him, I cringe at the thought of being touched or caressed by him, he does something thoughtful and completely normal boyfriend-ish and all I'm thinking is: For fuck sake's man! Just piss off for a moment!

I've been told that it's like a ""honey-moon's over"" sort of thing - but that doesn't really make sense. I was also thinking it's some intimacy issue stemming from a broken home or shitty relationship.

I've tried muscling through it -- I've tried getting some space - going away for a week, not talking to eachother every day, spending weekends alone, picking up a hobby that is specifically for me. I've tried to just enthusiastically throw myself back into the swing of things by doing nice and thoughtful things for him - but nothing works.

I become annoyed, frustrated, my usual bunny-like libido drops to nil. I become someone I no longer recognize. The minute I break things off with the guy, it's like I can breathe again.

I'm not some heinous manipulative bitch from Hell or anything. I'm a pretty chill and upbeat person who grew up with 4 brothers. I relate to and get along better with men than I do women.

Is this a normal dating thing? Maybe I've just been striking out a whole lot and only realizing it 3 months in? I've committed before, why can't I now?

Any advice would be appreciated. I've been seeing this one guy approaching 4 months now and I'm in a ""should I stay or should I go"" situation. There's nothing wrong with him. Really nice, really supportive, the kind of guy any girl deserves. He can be sort of shy and I think my biggest issue right now is that he apologizes for Everything.

I am, quite possibly, the hardest person to offend. After 4 months, a person should know this about me, right? I've talked to him about it. I know y'all ain't mind-readers. I told him straight up: Hey, unless you slap me across the face and call my mom a whore - you're not going to offend me. Please stop apologizing for every joke you make and quit walking on eggshells. My place is your place, my food is your food, my can is your can. You ask me for permission to take a piss One More Time, I am going to punch you in the face. Just. Be. Comfortable.

Guaranteed, we'll be joking around and he'll make an off-colour remark, apologize for it and say he was only joking. ""Really? You're joking? Because I totally thought that huge slew of racist slurs you just threw out at Chun-Li was super offensive. Get outta my house.""

Fuck. And then I start thinking about the things that piss me off about these guys: Calling to say goodnight. Worrying about offending me. Rubbing my back while we watch a show. Making dinner AND doing the dishes, even though I like to do the dishes if the other person made dinner and vice versa. What Is Fucking Wrong With Me?!?

I think a lot of it is, is that I don't want to be your girlfriend. I want to be your bro. Is that weird? Don't pamper me, don't treat me like I'm made of glass, don't put me on a pedestal, don't let me win at Streetfighter. When I say, ""Hey, asshole!"" It's a term of endearment and you can say ""How goes, shitface?""

Wow, I did not expect this to be a long post, but I guess I had a lot on my chest.

tl;dr -- I'm breaking hearts left, right and centre and I hate myself for it. I think I'd be better off alone. What do you think?

I feel like I have made significant progress since my [first post on this account](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/da3x8/consumed_by_guilt_how_do_i_get_over_my_mistakes/) in coming to terms with myself and my past mistakes.  Before, I was extremely broken, upset about the terrible things I had done - terrible because they shattered my own beliefs, things I had never imagined I could do - while in the healthiest relationship of my life.  I lost faith in myself.  I broke things off without confessing my crimes, believing it was too late to fix anything, that I was undeserving of even that relief of guilt (at his expense), that I was not ready or mature enough for a serious relationship.  At least I got things partly right.

However, after attempting to get on with my life and date like most girls my age, I realized I didn't have it in me.  I didn't even care.  I had stopped partying, stopped all the drugs, stopped going out.  Everything was bland and terrible, and all I could feel was the loss I had brought onto our lives, and the very painful fact that it was all my fault, I had broken it.  Guys used me and treated me like shit - I felt like I deserved it.  Others genuinely seemed to like me - I pushed them all away.  My friends were caring, but even the best friend can't read minds and baby you.  I isolated myself from everyone and everything... only scraping by on the bare minimum I needed to get from day to day.  I was getting ready to let go.  Every morning I woke up and thought blandly about how I could end it all.  Somewhere beneath or above it all, though, I knew it was a phase - it had to be because I wasn't going to live the rest of my life like this.  I would rather die.  I had also been severely depressed before twice in my life, so I felt it should pass, but it didn't make the shame and the guilt and the wretchedness any less.  

I felt like the most worthless human being on the planet, and to make it worse it seemed like I felt drawn to the act of cheating, that there was some sort of thrill out of it... the desire was still there whenever a taken guy friend made a move on me.  I felt disgusting for the elicit rush it would bring to think about it.  It was already enough that I had already destroyed the relationship that mattered most to me... would I be drawn into destroying others'?  It made me sick and I fluctuated between hating myself and wanting that indulgence, of being wanted.  I didn't know if I could ever be normally attracted to a person again, if I could trust myself to, and I definitely didn't know if I would ever be okay enough to.

And then I took a break, several weeks away from work and my stale routine.  I saw friends, I saw family, and it was a good time.  I did start to come around.  The time away gave me time to reflect and make some important decisions.  Riding off the wave of this good feeling, I ended up meeting someone who made my heart flutter, just a bit, and who was totally available.  Nothing has come of it yet, but it was the spark I needed to start feeling better.  Sexual attraction was no longer my enemy.  Somewhere inside something clicked, and I felt a complete synthesis with that part of me, like I was finally awake and could see it for what it was... simply a natural part of being human.  It's not the attractions we can control, but how we react to them.  And it takes the bigger person to do the right thing.

But you can't do any of that without accepting the attraction is there to begin with.  It was something I had always denied in previous relationships - that I could simultaneously be attracted to another person, and it blew up in my face, buried under all that denial.  In retrospect it seems obvious that the guys I had been involved with also took advantage of the situation, knowing exactly what it was because I am naive and confided in them as if we were friends.  In many ways I feel it takes a malicious person to be the outside person in an affair when they are fully aware of the other's relationship.  Nevertheless, the primary responsibility for maintaining the contract of the relationship falls on the people involved in it.  And, that being the case, both people need to be fully honest with each other **and themselves**.  

It's surprising how hard being honest with yourself is... admitting that there's a part of you that feels a certain way, no matter how much it disturbs you or goes against your values and beliefs.  And I realized that is the most important part.  In other terminology, it's called maturity.  But without it, people are bound to keep fucking up, over and over, and blame it on some bullshit excuse, wondering why it has to be this way.  For myself in any case, I finally accepted that there are certain unsavory things that exist in me and the world and that they will not cease to exist just because I ignore them.  I found once I stopped fighting that, everything became much simpler.  Not so much 'gonads and strife', just gonads.

These days I've rediscovered the pleasure of admiring from afar.  Yeah that guy's taken and yeah I know he kind of digs me too, but that's as far as it's going to go and that's fine.  I can enjoy the attraction for what it is, a pure, beautiful, human connection... if it's with a potential date, that's great, if not, it's not the end of the world.  There's no need for this angsty desire to consummate what we mutually feel, relationships aren't all about that anyway, we can still have meaningful exchanges without crossing any lines.  There is a joy in non-flirtatious conversation and shared experiences that simply pass and never deepen.  If it happens it happens, but only in complete cognizance of the situation.

Yeah, maybe it sounds like I finally got through puberty (yay!), maybe because I didn't date much until 17 and then was a serial monogamist, but this whole journey has been meaningful to me.  And in many ways I feel more at peace... and much more comfortable checking out *dat ass* without ever needing to touch it.",,False,,t5_2s90u,True,,,True,t3_fwiqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/fwiqg/coming_to_terms_with_attraction_and_its/,

I wasn't able to get a psych doctor's appt. about it until next month.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could go about forcing myself to eat? As it stands, I take one bite and it just makes me want to throw up. No food looks, smells, or tastes appealing. Even food that I used to love is a chore to eat now. 

I've been forcing myself to eat but it's really hard to get anything down when you gag on every bite. I've lost weight which is bad, because i was already almost underweight and most certainly am now.

She (f16) was my first girlfriend and i'm still fairly new about relationships. 

It was a small party of only about 9 people so it would be pretty hard to avoid talking to her (we haven't talked very much since our breakup September 2012.) At one point late at night, me and her went into our host-friends room and were snooping around with his computer. I was showing her YouTube videos and we were very slap-happy. I could tell she was having a good time and all, and I'd go as far as saying I'm almost wished we were back together (but I know that won't happen.)

The problem is I couldn't stop feeling the memories we had together laughing and being together, last summer it was the same house where I had my first kiss with her (she had another boyfriend before me whom we both knew well, so I'm not sure if she had hers yet.)

Coincidentally, I am posting this on what would have been our first year anniversary today, so you can tell this relationship didn't last long.

I still wish to remain friends as I'm sure she does too but I can't shake the past from my head whenever I'm around her.

My question is, with as much time as we had away from each other, why do I still feel like wanting her back, when I honestly don't?",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_1hsu1n,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1hsu1n/went_to_a_party_where_my_ex_gf_was_and_i_cant/,

I stay up pretty late, about 3:00, just on Youtube, Reddit, playing video games, and browsing GW subreddits. Then I wake up, sometimes early, sometimes just after enough sleep, sometimes after too much sleep. Regardless of how much sleep I get, I still have to lay in bed for about 30-45 minutes before I get up. Sometimes, I even fall back asleep and wake up about an hour, to an hour and a half, later.

I hound my friends to see if any of them are free and if no one responds, which is pretty often, I just get really down. I just stay in my room and watch TV, browse Reddit, or play video games for hours and hours and hours. 

If someone is available to hang out, I turn 180. I'm generally a very happy person. I'm funny, I'm energetic, I'm happy. I do love life. When I'm with friends, I have all the fun I can have, I make people laugh, I laugh. I just enjoy everything.

It's not constant however, it comes in episodes. I was bullied for most of my life which lead me to accept many of the mean things said to me as empirical fact (I'm annoying and a loser, I'm a failure if I can't get laid, I'm laughable for being angry because I'm too weak to do anything about it, I don't have friends because nobody likes me etc etc).

The bullying eventually stopped and I made a friend who was very supportive, but also extremely aggressive and opinionated. Her response to the self-loathing was to argue to me that literally everything about it was 100% false and that I'm awesome and attractive and likeable and everything the bullies said was a lie. This eventually processed into ""my life is a lie"" (which arguably made the bullying even harder to move past from).

I'm very easily influenced by the things people I care for say to me. I accepted the extremely contradictory messages I received from important people at two points of my life as possibly true and can't tell which is the truth. When I'm in a good mood I'm likeable and attractive and I'm only lonely because my shyness is off-putting. When I'm in a bad mood I'm abrasive and need to focus on changing my personality if I don't wanna be alone for the rest of my life, I'm unattractive and every girl who I ever thought was interested in me was just being nice and I'm a self absorbed idiot for assuming otherwise, if I were more likeable and attractive I wouldn't have to worry about being outgoing because people would reach out to me, and I'm lonely because nobody likes me.

I'm lost and confused and pissed off and don't know what to do. I feel misled and fooled by everyone. halp plz

tl;dr My life is comparable to a Silent Hill game where for awhile everything is normal and okay and then all of a sudden HOLY SHIT EVERYTHING IS HORRIFYING AND MISERABLE AND IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN (if you don't get the analogy maybe you should play Silent Hill because it's awesome).",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_1gwhi4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1gwhi4/i_regularly_shift_between_two_perceptions_of/,

1371877210.0,5,self.ihaveissues,1guatz,"Daughter [20], Here: My Mother's [51] Narcissism is Becoming Increasingly Difficult to Deal With...",,6,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1guatz/daughter_20_here_my_mothers_51_narcissism_is/,"I've just turned 20, although I've been dealing with my Mom's narcissistic behaviour for about 14 years. My Mom's issues arise from an emotionally abusive relationship with her Mother (my Mom's needs always came second to my Nanny's needs). I understand where these problems come from however, I can't substitute them as an excuse for the way she's behaved towards me for as long as I can remember. 

I can recall my earliest argument with her when I was 6 years old. I hit myself in the head because I didn't know how else to deal with the frustration. We've been in a cycle ever since. She gets mad. I try to tell her my side of the story so we can better understand each other and I get accused for being selfish. I apologize and reconcile. She gets mad... I still feel like that little girl, I just don't hit myself in the head anymore.

At some point I decided to stop mentioning my emotions at all. She didn't want to understand them and this was demonstrated by telling me that I was making it ""all about me"" and that I was being manipulative. This hasn't worked out very well because she tells me that she wants to understand and I tell her only to have her invalidate my emotions again. Now I just break down most times when she mentions something I've done to upset her. I also apologize profusely when she mentions something I've done wrong (e.g.: ""Sarah, you did this wrong."", ""Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry."")

Obviously, this isn't working. I feel emotionally exhausted trying to reconcile with someone who just wants to hear that she is right, but also makes these awkward and problematic attempts at trying to figure out why I'm so upset at home. The apologies aren't as bad as they used to be, but I still struggle with accepting favours from people and especially money. I feel like I deserve none of it because I am never doing enough to deserve it.

She has frequently threatened to kick me out of the house. Usually it is because she feels like I'm not doing enough around the house, while she spends a lot of her time at home ""relaxing"" on the computer. She works an average 40-hour/ week job and has no extra-circulars and no relationship/ spouse or friends (I spend a lot of time being her friend and listening to her issues).

For the record, I am a full-time university student who recently quit her job because, well... I was being threatened with being kicked out of the house. I don't feel capable or able enough to sustain a place to live, an education and a job all at once. My Mom also has control over my RESP and this makes things a bit more complicated.

My Mom is an excellent provider when it comes to material things. Not such a great provider when it comes to emotional things. My severe hesitance to share anything with her emotionally typically bleeds over into material things because I feel like my needs are invalid (like my emotions). I rarely ask about things for myself so as to spare her the inconvenience. Even if she offers, there is always a time that I hear about ""everything she does for me"" and that I should be more grateful.

Recently, she forced me to break up with someone who was very good to me. Again, she threatened to kick me out. This was incredibly frustrating to me because in the past I dated an emotionally abusive, narcissistic person who even blatantly described the fucked up situations he put me in and my Mom hardly reacted to it. Now that I found someone who treats me well and the way I deserve, she resents him. This might also stem from jealousy because she has always had dysfunctional relationships with men.

I should also mention that she has been extremely critical of my weight. I used to run and be more active last summer, but I stopped because I hit a plateau and got frustrated. I also experienced symptoms of exercise-induced asthma that prevented me from running as much as I'd like. She would lament about everything I used to do and how good I looked back then. This made me feel incredibly inadequate and uncomfortable. 

I gained at the most, 10 lbs. Though she exaggerates and tells me 30lbs. She also blames it on my relationship with the really nice guy just because he was a bigger guy (goes to the gym every day, but has a metabolic issue). She critiques my portions and recently told me that I ""eat like a trucker"". I know that her Mother used to be very critical of her weight, so again I try to be sympathetic. I mentioned how uncomfortable this behaviour makes me and now she gets mad at me because she claims that she can't even talk to me anymore.

Last night, we had an argument about my weight. I skipped dinner and cleaned up after her. She ended up screaming at me and telling me ""fuck you"" and flipping me off for being so ""rude"" and ""disrespectful"". I remember when I would merely swear ABOUT something in an argument and she would cry verbal abuse. Now she gets to be verbally abusive FOR REAL and its a-okay. I apologized to her (I know that what she did is wrong) because I know she wants to hear me tell her that she's right, etc. She gave a half-assed, over-the-shoulder apology about screaming at me, slamming my door and walking away. These are all things she does regularly during an argument. She never apologized about the verbal abuse. In fact, I brought it up again today and she told me that she had every reason to verbally abuse me.

Today, I was going to go to a movie by myself and she started screaming at me again and called me a ""jerk"". This was also caused by my not really saying anything when her friend called her ""hot"". I've always praised my mother and I've done plenty of things to show that I appreciate her (make her breakfast every time I can, greet her at the door, always ask her what she needs/ wants, etc.) and I feel like she's just looking for excuses to be abusive. I'm not subservient enough for her and this is also the reason why all of her relationships fail.

I feel like everything she does for me is so that she eventually may use it as fodder in an argument, because this is what she has ALWAYS done and is still doing. Any time I ask for something emotional or even material, I make it ""all about me"". I've learned not to ask for much or at least do it in a very strategic way.

I have always done my best to make my Mother feel validated. I am as compassionate as I can possibly be towards her narcissism and why she behaves this way. I listen to her brag about how she looks and all the compliments she gets. I humour her when she thinks her crush is spying on her. I listen to all of her issues, even when she interrupts me while I study. I do everything I possibly can to make her happy and again, I feel like I've always felt; I'm never good enough.

I know that this is A LOT to take in. This has been an issue in my life for at least 14 years, so I'm sorry if it seems patchy and I'll try to clarify wherever I can. I feel trapped and I feel like I don't know what to do anymore. So, I seek an objective perspective to perhaps tell me that I am as wrong as I'm being made to feel. Or that I'm actually doing an okay job and maybe I can find some helpful suggestions.

Thank you to all who took the time to read, contemplate and advise on this mess.

However, for the past year, I haven't really been able to make any progress on that front.

I have close friends, both male and female, although most of them live far away. I've even had close calls in starting relationships with female friends, but there's always been something preventing it. In my new location, I haven't really gotten too close to anyone, except work friends that I sometimes go out to dinner with in the evenings. More recently, I've put a little effort into my look, bought nicer clothes, kept up my general appearances. About a year ago, I started working out a lot, and I have a routine at home that I do several times a week, can run 5 miles, do 10 pullups, etc.

I even tried hanging out in more social places. I go to local concerts, hang out at a nearby coffee shop and park, try to get out more. I just can't really seem to meet women in a dating sense. I am not confident at all, and I'm extremely uncomfortable acting that way. I can't really get myself to go up to women cold, and start a conversation. I tried once going to a bar alone, and just forced myself to talk to people. It was one of the most awkward experiences of my life, and I haven't really recovered enough to try again since.

I tried online dating, OKCupid and Match.com. I vetted my profile with /r/okcupid, and sent out maybe 70 or 80 messages using common, sensible advice for how to do so. I get very few replies though, and none of them have led to dates. I think I get filtered out a lot of searches or replies, since I am short (5'5"") and somewhat losing my hair. I feel completely demoralized by this approach, and I don't think I have it in me to try another year of the online sites, and be disappointed week after week.

I just don't really know what to do now. I'm started to get really lonely and depressed on the weekends. I know I could force myself to keep trying. In the beginning I was so sure that things would work out, since I had never really actually tried to meet anyone before, and I was a successful, well-adjusted, nice guy. And then the failures kept piling on, month after month. It's gotten to the point where I've begun to spend my evenings alone at home, feeling sorry for myself.

We have amazing sex though, and became great friends.

The only problem is that I am developing serious feelings for him. He's all I think about. We text for hours every night and that's the highlight of my day, I'm incredibly infatuated. 

What I need to know is...how do I stop this? Surely there's a way to train yourself to not catch feelings. I'm only going to get hurt.

And there's 0 chance of me not fucking him again.

But I mean...if these feelings are just chemical reactions in my head there has to be a way to control it.

he doesnt see her anymore and he doesnt have any contact with her but now whenever he talks to another female my brain automatically thinks that he is gonna cheat on me again even though he promised me up and down that he wont i just have a part of me that says hes lying and once a cheater always a cheater. in one part of our relationship he actually deleted every girl from his facebook account and phone but he got mad because he couldn't talk to his female friends again. so i said whatever do what you want. a few weeks ago we went out to dinner with a few of his co workers, one whom was a girl. once this girl got up to go to the bathroom my fiance checked her out head to toe and i saw it 100% , he admits that he did and he even told me he finds her attractive. the second he adds her on facebook he messaged her and talked all day and all night. i just find this so weird because he HATES talking to me and admitted to it. he doesnt really talk to me either which sucks, not even a phone call to say hi how are you. i just dont know what to do.

 i am not sure if this is my anxiety and jealousy but i cant even sleep at night anymore all i keep thinking about is him falling for this girl and the shitty thing is, is that hes everything he loves. she has tattoos, works with video games, and shes thin. i just dont know what to do anymore, i am seeing a counselor to get advice but she just tells me to keep my mouth shut so i dont say the wrong thing. how am i supposed to marry someone that i dont trust 100%? i cant. 

i just wish he understood how i feel, whenever i try to talk about my problems or how i feel about something he just doesnt get it. can someone please help me out and tell me what to do, i dont wanna break up with him i just need to learn how to let go of the past and idk how to.....no trolling please and thank you.

I'm a 26  year old guy and I'm so completely inept at interacting with other people that I have a tendency to creep them out. This doesn't happen with my guy friends as often as it does with females of all types, though admittedly my guy friends have said I act like I'm living in the 1940's sometimes with the way I approach relationships. 

For example, last year I had a date with a girl for a walk in the park. I'd known her for a while from work, and I liked her. So I got her some flowers and gave them to her on our walk. Later that week we went hiking and she sat down in front of me, and I put my arms around her. She didn't seem to have an issue with it and we kept talking and enjoying the air. Even held hands on the way back. 

After that though, she seemed completely creeped out by me and I have no idea why. 

More recently, I told a friend who I've had a crush on for over a year about my feelings. I was clear about how I felt and that I thought we would make a good couple, and asked to hang out. She said okay, but never got back to me. We have mutual friends at work, and when I told one friend about my feelings he said she was burnt out on relationships and simply wanted to be friends. I said it was cool. 

Mind you, this girl was used by another guy at work for several months. I felt that her inclination to be single was brought on by that event. I stated to my friend at work that the guy who used her ""ruined it"" for me. This friend then told my crush that I said ""She was ruined,"" so she became mad at me. I tried to tell her it was a misunderstanding but I don't think she believed me...  

I sent her a message later on just to chat and the subject came up, I reiterated my feelings(I felt I was being forthcoming...), and told her I'd never have said something like that about her, and asked simply if we could hang out as friends.  

I may have also mentioned that I was pissed at the mutual friend who ran his mouth and wanted to know where he got off repeating a private conversation. She was...unimpressed. 

That night at work my boss approached me, telling me that the mutual friend I spoke of had told him I wouldn't leave the girl alone, which simply isn't true. He told me to back off and not talk to her anymore. 

I thought it might have been a lie, my boss has done it before and I'm reluctant to trust him. I didn't think my friend would do something like that. I hadn't talked to him in days before I finally couldn't take the anxiety anymore and spoke to him tonight. It turns out not only was it true, but he said he did it because I was making the girl feel uncomfortable. 

I honestly and truly don't understand what I did to make her feel creeped out. I even told her if anything I said made her feel uncomfortable to tell me and we could just forget I said anything at all. 

I feel betrayed and like I lost two good friends simply because I told a girl I liked her. I also feel like everyone at work thinks I'm a completely creeper psycho guy and that it will become a reputation that follows me around.

Seeing as how this isn't the first time something like this has happened, I obviously have issues not being a creeper. I'd like to fix that, because otherwise I feel fundamentally broken. It honestly feels like not being a creeper should be the default setting, but it isn't.

Really hoping I don't get torn apart...I'm feeling really really down about all of this as it is.

I've been suffering from vague stomach/digestion problems and aggressive acne on my face and back. 

My family never knew what to do so they sent me away when I was a teen. I lived in programs, foster homes, and wards. They had me on psych drugs for a few months when I was 15, but I stopped that myself and never went back on them. 

I moved every year of my life growing up, ran away at 17, struggling to keep it together on my own ever since. Been homeless, been starving, suffering, struggling, doing the best I can. At times succeeding, at times flopping out... Haven't seen my family in 6 years, don't want to.

Lately I've been dating a man 21 years older than myself. He's been doing yoga 4 times a week for years and makes these delicious, nutrient-rich juices everyday with fruits, vegetables, and roots. He takes very good care of himself. He's fairly well-off with a heart of gold. He has the resources and upon meeting me felt driven to use them to help me out. He loves me and I love him.

He'll put a whole bag of carrots, 2 apples, a big piece of ginger, a bunch of spinach, 2 whole oranges, a whole grapefruit, etc. Different combinations of these things into one bottle of juice for breakfast. This is what he's been giving me and I love it. Tastes great, feels amazing.

He signed me up for yoga and pays for it and I go 6-7 days a week. He makes me juices whenever we see each other. Sometimes I stay with him and he makes me food and juice. He gives me money to make sure I get enough to eat and can get around. He pays for my phone, clothes, etc. We've been seeing each other for about 3 months, he's an angel. It's not without its complications, but he's definitely the hero I need right now. 

My point is not to talk about this man, really. My point is to talk about the effects of healthy diet and exercise on my body and mind. 

First of all, my acne is nearly obliterated. I've had this god-awful ugly mask on my otherwise attractive face for over 10 years and in the course of 2.5 months it is almost entirely gone. 

My mood is better, I sleep better, I just feel like I can function better as a living creature going about my business.

This has lead me to think I've probably been suffering from a vitamin deficiency for all these years. Perhaps deficient diet can explain many of the problems I've had.

Growing up my parents didn't really cook. I know I didn't get enough vitamins in my diet. TV dinners don't usually provide those. I shit you not, one time at the grocery store I wanted organic grape juice and my mother's reaction was literally, ""EW, Organic!?"" yeah. She likes Wendy's. She's thin and I take after her, but my dad is a fat-ass. He likes KFC the best. They had poor diets, therefore I had a poor diet. It didn't get much better after they put me away. 

I've tried as an adult to provide for myself. I eat as much raw food as I can, I'm at about %65 raw vegan/vegetarian, have been for a few years. 

Since running away at 17, I've been trying to make something good out of all this. It's been a struggle, not easy. I've done as much as I can, but it always seemed like it wasn't quite enough.

Now that this man has come into my life I've had that extra push to help me get that rock to the top of the hill. He's used his influence to really help me get the vitamins and exercise I've really needed this whole time. 

I never needed psych drugs, I needed a better diet. I needed yoga. I needed to be taken care of and now I am. I needed help taking care of myself and now I've got it. I never had that before.

I know not everyone can find some rich older guy to take care of them, but I think it's valuable to note the effect of good diet and exercise. 

If you're suffering, consider diet, exercise, and your other basic needs. You might be suffering from a vitamin deficiency, too. 

TL;DR: Diet and exercise, plus having some other basic needs taken care of, has helped me become healthier and happier and has nearly rid my body of acne and pain.

A short background: I've recently broken up with somebody, whom I am still in love with. We had a long distance relationship for the last 6 months we were together, and it was really tearing us down. We ended on great terms - both agreeing we still loved and cared about each other, and that now isn't the right time for us to try and work on our relationship. We are now attempting to be friends and it's terribly hard, especially since it's made me question why we broke up (there were A LOT of reasons). Basically, I've had a rough few months trying to get over somebody who I still talk to frequently. Not easy stuff, my friends.

So the solution I came up with to attempt to get over this guy? Hook up with another one. Great plan, right?! I've never done something like that before, and now seemed like a good a time as any to try something out. I started chatting with this dude I met online (a dating site, and the one I met my previous boyfriend on) and it was very clear based on our chatting that we were going to basically just meet up to hook up. Fine by me. It sounded fun! Definitely a little kinkier than I'm used to….but I always say don't knock something till you try it. So I did.

Met up with this guy at a bar, he seemed nice/normal enough, chatted for awhile and went back to his place. Sexy times began, and for the most part I enjoyed it. What happened that is eating me up inside now, that I thought nothing of at the time, was that I let him film me. It seemed hot at the time - we said we were going to watch it together the next time we met up. Great! Except the fact when I woke up the next morning, the enormity of it all it me - what the FUCK did I just do?

I let a stranger, whom I know NOTHING about, film me doing some kinky shit I have never done, and probably will never do again. I let him know that day that I had fun, but had no intentions of meeting up again, and that I'd prefer he didn't keep the videos. I didn't expect this to be successful, and it wasn't. He said no hard feelings, but he was going to watch them still. Fine. That wouldn't bother me.

What bothers me is that lord only knows what he's actually going to do with them. Could he really just keep them for his own personal enjoyment? Totally. Could he post them on the internet for everybody and their mother to see? Most definitely. Will he? The uncertainty is what kills me.

I'm a very in control person. I like to have all my ducks in a row. Me hooking up with this guy was me 'letting go', and it would have been fine to be left at that. But now he has dirt on me and the power to do whatever he wants with them. It makes me sick to my stomach to think about what COULD happen. I don't necessarily feel used….I agreed to everything. And enjoyed it. I just feel….dirty. It was captured on film and will exist for a lot longer than merely a memory. My self-esteem has done a 180 in such a short period of time. It's crazy.

I keep telling myself that he doesn't even know me - only first name, doesn't know where I live/work/hang out. The only thing he can tie back to me is my face. The only thing letting me hold my shit together is this. I never have to see/speak to him again. 

I realize there is NOTHING I can do. The only thing I can do is not let it eat me up inside. What's done is done. I just need to know how to MOVE ON. How to not worry about something until there is something to actually worry about. To stop thinking about what COULD happen, but what is currently happening. I just don't know how to do that. I'm seriously considering going to see a counselor over this, it's bothering me that much. This was over a week ago and it's all I think about constantly. 

I just need to get this off my chest, and if anybody has any advice for me I gladly accept it. I know what I did was stupid, I don't ned to be reprimanded on my choices.

She is two years younger than me. We clicked and so I asked her to go to my senior prom with me. She said yes and we had a really fun time together.
I never really wanted to start a relationship with her -- mostly because I was going to be starting my first year of college and I didn't think that it could work out with us being so far apart. However, she did things that gave me the impression that she wanted more from it. For instance, she sat through my three and a half hour graduation ceremony just so she could see me. In the hopes that things would calm down a bit, I've intentionally been a little bit distant...

Anyway, I just got back from college, and out of the blue she started messaging me saying that we should meet and catch up -- that sort of thing. Under almost any other circumstance, it wouldn't bother me.. but the way she's talking -- saying things like ""I can't wait to see you"" is making me kind of uneasy.

So we're planning on meeting up soon, and it sounds like she wants to go get ice cream or something of that sort.

My mother and two younger sisters. I hope this is the correct sub for this, so here it goes.

 My mom, 42, is financially challenged, always stressed, and lashes out constantly. She doesn't know how to handle stress, she is bad with money and she always blames others for her problems. She constantly tells us all of her problems, and I'm sympathetic of course, but I hate hearing about all of these things that I have no control over. She tells my sisters and I too much, in my opinion, like the fun stuff she did while out with her friends and financial issues that I cannot help her with, though I wish I could. She acted like too much of a friend when we were young and I believe it has caused a lot of problems. She recently quit her job as a teacher because she didn't like her boss. She is done with teaching in two weeks and has not gotten another job yet. I'm scared because she's up until 3am every night trying to sell bullshit on ebay because every little bit helps. She's not thinking long-term. Also, she is obsessed with my sister [14] and her playing soccer. She always talks about how great at soccer she is, which she is, and thinks it's just wonderful how she is a complete bitch to my dad (remarried with a child whom we see every other weekend) and refuses to talk to him. My mother and father do not get along and my mom has a lot to say about him, which angers me because I love him. The anger towards my dad has spread to my sister, who believes he does not support her. I don't know really know, it's just stupid. I digress, I just feel like my mom cannot handle her life. She always complains and screams about how she 'hates this life' and how 'your father is such a pussy!' and I can't handle it. Also, they're all very, very messy. The house is all cluttered, they don't pick up after themselves and my mom gets angry that we don't clean. I'm not perfect, of course I'm a little messy, but not nearly as bad as they are. I try to keep my room clean, which is in the basement, but they are always down here with food and expect me to keep it all clean. I'm not going to clean up after them. I just feel my mom is destructive with the way she handles her and our lives.

My one sister [11] has many issues, she has a case of depression, she has an extreme tantrum, she cannot function rationally. Her explosive attitude is always a problem, she screams constantly and conflicts with my other sister and my mom quite often. I fear for her, because she too likes to blame others for her problems. She does not do well in school, and she is too involved with her friends. I feel bad for her because she is my little sister, but she doesn't understand how to be social, she acts out, and she treats others badly. I don't know what to tell her because if you try to talk to her as if she did something wrong she screams and tells you all the things YOU do wrong. 

And my other sister [14] is the biggest antagonist ever. She causes my other sister to go berserk daily. Fighting is normal for two sisters but it is over the top. A few weeks ago her and my other sister were fighting and she ended up starting to beat the shit out of her. I, of course, ran up to stop it and told her to go upstairs and she ended up dumping some drink all over me and throwing the glass at me pretty hard. She then proceeded to run out of the house and didn't come back for like 2 hours. While she was out she burned her arm intentionally. My mom was at work while this happened, then it was blamed on me even though I tried to stop it the whole time.

Next year I'll be leaving for college, that is if we have the funds for it(I have a job and am saving my money), I'll hopefully get some sort of grants and some help from my Dad. I'm just fearful for this next year. My mom does not have a job yet, and I can't stand our lifestyles. They are very mean and I just feel, truthfully, that I just need to leave. I do not want to turn out like my mother. She is a hard worker and cares about us more than anything, don't get me wrong, but she is deluded.  When I'm gone I'm afraid they won't be able to function. I'm the facilitator for the most part. I've been up until 6am trying to calm them down because they're just going insane on each other.  My mom also borrows money from me on occasion, which I don't see again. 

Any advice on dealing with all of this? Am I overreacting? I don't want to sound like a brat.

1369580545.0,5,self.ihaveissues,1f300m,Infidelity [M26],throwawaypisces,5,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1f300m/infidelity_m26/,"(Using a throwaway.)

Despite my overwhelming social awkwardness and introverted tendencies, I have had a few short-lived relationships in my life; a grand whopping three to be more specific. All have ended in similar circumstances--infidelity in varying degrees--and each one has lent it's own hand in building a wall between me and any potential emotional connections I might make.

The first relationship bears special mention because the infidelity began within the first few weeks. I met my first 'serious' girlfriend--let's call her N--shortly after my 20th birthday through one of my best friends. She liked to put on the dark, mysterious exterior, though she was more of a giggly nerd with dark makeup. We clicked pretty well and, for better or worse, things got physical between us rather quickly. Having not had any experience with sex prior, my performance was about as appalling as one might imagine. However, N didn't make a big deal of it. I tried to take that to heart, but I never really shook it off. Either way, she and I dated for about six months. 

The sex was still awful by the end of those six months, but emotionally she and I became rather attached. In the final days of our relationship, we'd had a series of serious talks. We batted around the idea and weight of the L-word, if we wanted to try moving in together in the near future, and, eventually, the sex. When it came to sex, N didn't have much to say. That is, until she admitted to me that she had slept with someone else not a full two weeks after we'd started dating. I didn't really know how to handle that at the time, so I broke things off between us pretty quickly thereafter. It wasn't pretty, but I didn't know how to deal with it.

**tl;dr** - *N; goth-ish/nerd chick, met through a friend, confessed to having slept with someone else two weeks into our relationship after we'd been dating six months.*

About a year following my breakup with N, I met another woman--we'll call her O. She was a very artsy, free-spirited type I met through one of my college classes. We started out as friends, but one day she made a move on me. O and I were physical pretty much from the get-go. While the actual sex was still pretty bad, everything but was better. That being said, she didn't really fit in with my group of friends at the time nor did I with hers, so whatever time we had together was usually spent with just the two of us. It wasn't bad, but I did lose a friend or two because of it.

O and I didn't date for very long; three and a half, four months at most. However, by the end of that time there was a strange tension between us. O was a very sexual person and I could tell that my performance wasn't exactly up to par--that, compounded with the performance with N only made things worse. However, I'd attempted to improve my skill in other areas of the bedroom which I had hoped would solve the problem. It didn't. Eventually, O told me that she had feelings for and had been seeing/sleeping with a friend of hers I had met. We had an awkward exchange after and she sort of wandered out of my life.

**tl;dr** - *O; artsy, lusty, pixie girl who doesn't gel with my friends nor I with her friends. Things get awkward fast and she hooks up with one of her aforementioned friends.*

In the year and a half that followed, I'd become a bit of a recluse. My circle of friends shrunk by a considerable margin and what few new people I met, I did so online. One such person--we'll call him T--I met through an online dating site I'd signed up for out of curiosity. Again, he and I had great chemistry from day one, but it took a while for things to get physical between us. Even so, things didn't fare much better. However, T was not nearly as sexual a person as either N or O, so it was rarely an issue.

Being the longest of my relationships (eight months), T and I had many of the same serious conversations as N and I had. These appeared to go over quite a bit better; no secret infidelity reveal and all that. However, T was not one for confrontation and so he allowed some issues he had with me lie a bit too long. He and I had planned a trip to a nearby large city over the next summer which, at that time, was only a few months away. Then one day, T tells me that he's going on a weekend trip to said city with a few of his friends. Being that this was with only a few days' notice, I didn't have the ability to get work off, so I sent him on his way. He left Friday, called me Saturday in tears and confessed that he'd had a one-night stand, met me on Monday, and it was there we broke up.

**tl;dr** - *T; a cute, if naive guy who, after 8 months together, took a trip out of state and had a one night stand.*

Call me hard-headed, ignorant, naive, or whatever else you like, but it took until that day when T and I broke up for something to hit me. It wasn't just something that T said, but something that N,O, and T had all said: I never opened up to them. I suppose I could write of N for first-timer's ignorance, but it seems like something I should have known from the beginning. With O, I was trying to stop myself from getting hurt by being more reserved just in case. That, along with not being able to be around our respective groups of friends, just made for less openness all around. When it finally came to T, I was a closed book. Hell, I might have had a clasp welded on and a combination lock. He didn't know me at all because I was too afraid to expose myself to him. And in that fear, I neglected him. What he did wasn't right, but I wasn't helping.

I can't open up anymore. Even with my friends, I'm reserved with how much expressing myself and in what ways. I've been alone for some years now and I fear that I'm beyond recovery. I don't know how to open up to people, I'm terrible in bed, and I'm a shut-in. I don't know what to do with myself anymore and I'm sick of being alone.

I can agree, i guess, but i dont know how and what i can do to change.

Quick background on my dad and mom: i live at home with my folks and havent even spoken to my mom in two years. Growing up she was very violent and abusive to my dad, but he stayed around for his kids (not a good reason, i know). She trapped him by getting pregnant with me (something she used to throw in my face) so he married her because hes such a good guy. 11ish years ago she cheated on him and left him for my childhood doctor, then the doctor kicked her out because of her aggressive ways so she begged for my dad back and he took her back for his kids. Fast forward to just 2 years ago, he found his highschool sweetheart and has been having an affair that my brother and i encourage. He deserves happiness but he wont leave my mom because shes never worked a day in her life (shes 50), she has mental problems, is homicidal and suicidal and hes worried about where she'll end up. 

My aunt thinks i have serious committment issues, and i am scared of getting trapped, even though nobody has tried ""trapping"" me ever. I met my bf when i was 18, he was concerned with my age and him just getting out of a divorce was an easy target for me. Destined for failure from the start. Ive always been an easy person, i have had over 35 partners in a little over 7 years. Ive never been faithful as a young teenager and even now. 

Ive been with him on and off again for almost 5 years this November. Ive ruined it every time by cheating on him and getting caught, but he keeps wanting to work it out with me. I love him, i really do. I got caught cheating again two weeks ago, and that time was supposed to be my last time (before i got caught.) For the first time since i became sexually active, I've decided i want to change. I want to be with this man, i need to grow up and i cant do this anymore. Im tired of sleeping around, talking to multiple men, running from committment. 

I am so scared though, i dont know what im scared of, but i just am. Even after getting caught, i dropped all the guys i talked to except for one and i just tried pulling in a different guy. Then i broke down in tears, came on Reddit and saw this subreddit. I wont go to a shrink, i'll shut down and not say anything... It's easier over text hiding behind a screen.

I am a successful accountant with a profitable sideline business. I am a typical ""nice guy"" (do not smoke, no drugs, drink occasionally, no abuse). We were dating off and on for 11 years (separate residences), then got married almost 2 years ago. I feel I made a terrible mistake. We have horrible fights and I have to keep apologizing for past mistakes over and over (past issues always come up in fights). Here is the latest one: In January my mother passed away. I received an email from my ex-wife (we have been divorced 12 years and have literally no contact - we have both moved on). She wants to attend the funeral and asks my permission if she can attend - I personally did not care but knew my current wife would, so I told her about the email and asked what she wanted to do, and she said it was fine that my ex-wife attended. This all lead to a series of fights, all with the tone that I was now ""communicating"" with my ex-wife.

This turned into a huge fight with my wife, because I did not tell her and I am now branded a ""liar by omission"". This means she now wants to regularly check my email history because it is a ""trust"" issue. I am not a cheater (never have been, and never will) and am taking huge exception on my supposed lack of integrity. The topic of my ex-wife has now become regular conversation (mostly ugly), even though I want nothing to do with her. Is any or all of this reasonable on her part?

So I'm suffering from a problem that sort of matches a lot of others' I've been reading about here, but in sort of a specific way. To elaborate on the title, I have progressed from paralytically shy and anxious to having largely ""normal,"" open, close, and fulfilling friendships with many friends and family and don't find it terribly challenging to allow myself to let go and share my interests/thoughts/opinions/feelings with most of them. Something weird happens to me when a relationship moves into the romantic territory, though, and suddenly I feel huge amounts of shame and embarrassment for lifestyle choices and worldviews I perceive as somehow being at odds with hers or the rest of the world's. Some issues I have been able to articulate recently would include...

- A constant expectation that I need to justify myself on pastimes/choices that I worry others perceive as questionable.
- A weird aversion from letting people see me enjoy what I am doing or letting them see my thought process (especially as a music student) unless I am secure with how the audience will perceive it.
- A nagging belief that everyone around me seems already to know what they're doing and that I'm scrambling to keep up and discover what the ""right"" way to go about life is.

These are issues that manifest themselves in all but the closest friendships; they're kind-of-sort-of tenable in daily friendships, but because of the openness I wish to see in a romantic relationship I'm worried I would be ""discovered"" as being a weirdo or being boring or somehow unappealing to the other once we started to become romantically involved. It turns me into this shell of a person who is forced into ""playing a role"" to see the relationship progress rather than giving it no more concerted effort than I would a typical, good friendship; this it murders any no-strings-attached fulfillment I might otherwise feel. It's worth mentioning that this is an issue I struggle with with all women to a certain degree, and it just becomes more painfully apparent as things progress in this direction.

This has led me to really explore and question my motives for getting into relationships or even what they're ""supposed"" to be about. A part of me would be happy to throw my hands up and just stop looking to make it work, but I don't really see this as a solution because I have never had a relationship last more than a few weeks and I don't believe I have the experience necessary to make a sensible decision, not to mention all the potentially positive experiences I would be deliberately passing up. Active focus/interest in seeing a relationship move forward inevitably feels like a chore because I am already aware of this battle in my head and it all leads to more anxiety than enjoyment unless things are already going -really- well for us. I have had huge success in getting the ball rolling if I am already certain of mutual attraction or if I have had a few drinks earlier in the evening, and while those are beacons of hope for me they're still pretty unsatisfactory work-arounds, especially the alcohol.

I'm also sick of worrying about all the ""game"" bullshit - if I can have deep, meaningful friendships with what is essentially no practiced or emulated behavior why can't that happen with romantic relationships too? That doesn't mean I don't expect it to be easy or effortless as far as living out the relationship is concerned but more that I am frustrated seeing my approach fail and wonder how it can be fixed, and it doesn't help that I feel this need to hide myself all the time. Am I sex-driven? Of course, but at this point I am more interested in seeing the openness I feel with guy friends unfold with women as well - sex is just icing on the cake. Is it uncommon or flawed to want a romantic relationship to work the same way two best friends might feel about each other but with the physical element as just an additional dimension?

What if I were to do what ""I wanted to do"" all the time? Romantic relationships? I wouldn't talk to women ever (god forbid sharing my hobbies and interests with them), I would never step out of my comfort zone, and I would cling to what I knew was comfortable and non-threatening: being alone. Friend-zoned relationships? No problem.

So I'm really interested to hear what perspectives people in successful, long-term, *open and communicative* relationships might hold. Why do you start them? What do you feel, how much do you have to think about it, and how have you gotten to a place where you don't need to keep walls up? Do you feel like you're playing to a script? Does your relationship with him/her have many/few parallels with close platonic friendships? How are they different? How much of what I'm asking is a symptom of anxiety coupled with little experience? Is my problem uncommon?

Y'all rock. Many thanks.

**TL;DR: I am growing in confidence in my self image and self-worth with every passing day in all of my relationships but there is a part of me that reflexively hides my real identity from those I wish to be most close to. I have to ""say the right thing,"" ""be the right guy,"" ""do the right things,"" all just so I can sweep this anxiety under the rug. I don't feel like I deserve to experience close romantic relationships or am too much of an odd-ball to allow for it to happen on its own. The issue exists with all women, but especially close, potentially romantic ones.

I've ever only been on one real relationship when I was 18 and that lasted more or less a year. In that year we broke up once or twice and it was extremely destructive and isolating. We both started off as fuck buddies then he broke it off after a month, told me he didnt want to do this anymore, and got back together with his ex gf the next day. We didnt talk for another month and then somehow ended up at the same party and rekindled things. He went to study abroad for the summer where we kept in touch but I was still an emotional wreck. This was also the year where my best friend and I split ways because this was the second time I found out she got involved with a guy behind my back(not ex bf) that I expressed interest in. Anyway, while he was abroad things at home were very bad. One night I was falling apart in my room drinking and cut two big gashes on my left wrist as I cried. I've self-harmed before in middle school but that was more of a strange morbid curiosity than a depression thing. I guess my mom heard me crying that night and when I went to work the next day she went through my room and found the beer, and my journal where I wrote about my sexipades with the ex-bf and two guys before him and problems with the best friend ( My parents are traditional Asian parents), freaked out and went to my work to drag me home to tell me how I need to save myself for marriage and that my future husband wont want me when he finds out I'm not a virgin on our wedding day. When the ex bf got back from abroad, we decided to be a couple and I knew I had to tell him what I did to myself. I self-harmed once after that during our year together but never again after that. 

What I am saying is aside from all that shit, I am a completely different person now and have not come close or even thought about hurting myself again. During the dark times, I was an introverted awkward girl but was still generally well liked with everyone. And now, although I have introverted tendencies I have learned to fake extroversion like its second nature and am very comfortable and confident in my own skin. I'm not afraid to like the nerdy things I like, and have been told to have a very distinct sense of humor and a ""dont-give-a-fuck"" persona. I go out every weekend and have multiple social circles as well as my close nit group of girls that I trust with my life. The thing is, that I have not been in a serious relationship in the last 5 years since the ""dark times."" I feel like I have been literally and figuratively scarred from my ex bf that I just have this ice cold box where my heart used to be. I seem aloof and I've had a handful of brief hook ups and a couple of guys that never lasted for a few months that I would end things with because things were getting too serious. One of the guys got close but I realized we were not right for each other. He once caught a glimpse of my scars (I don't really try to hide them, I used to with bracelets and hair-ties but now its second nature that I angle my wrist in a way where its out of sight) and I awkwardly avoided the question and he dropped it. I am seriously freaked out for the day where I have to explain my scars to my kids and a future partner. I feel like I will be forever stand-offish that I only seem like I want nothing serious but I only really just want a healthy relationship where I can be open about my past. If you met me now, you would have never known that I would be the type to self-harm and I just feel like I will have my walls up forever and no guy will want to attempt to climb them unless I am willing to put them down. I'm not depressed or anything I just realized that my scars and my 18yo past are the root of why I do not get close or open up to guys at all.

I was a year older and went off to college a few hours away, but he was going to go to the same college. In the middle of that LDR year, he suddenly stopped calling me as much and I felt like he didn't care about me, and after I told him that many times, he broke up with me. We are friends now, and he is a good guy but with the way he treats me now/the way he is now, I could never be with him.

Okay so the problem is that I have this really perfect vision of our relationship, up until the end. I was the happiest then, probably because life was easy in high school, and I still feel like his 16 year old self and my 17 year old self were perfect for each other. It's been a year since we broke up but we have hooked up a couple times (this was many months ago, right before my current boyfriend and I started dating) and that sort of sparked old feelings again back then. I think I am over him because I don't want to be with the person he is now, but I am still attracted to him and his personality, since we meshed really really well. Edit: I'll tell him that we shouldn't talk now though, because I think that would help me fully 100% move on.

So yeah, I am in a current [4 months] relationship with another, great guy. But I keep comparing him to the perfect vision of my ex from high school, and I compare our relationship to mine then. Since I only seem to remember the good parts of the relationship, of course this new guy would never live up. I keep finding flaws with him that I didn't have with my ex (ie., he isn't as funny, etc) but I don't know how to just appreciate him for him and get over my insane memory of my old relationship. Gah help please!

PS: I feel I am not as happy as I was with the first guy, and that my current boyfriend isn't as perfect for me as my ex was... and this thought has made me really consider breaking up with him, even though we are both happy together. Is this a real issue or am I blowing something up out of nowhere? I love him, but I'm not head-over-heels in love like I was with the first guy. Of course the relationship isn't as long as the first, etc, but should I break up with him to try to find another head-over-heels guy, or am I being crazy trying to find the ""perfect"" guy that actually only exists in my skewed memory?

TL;DR: I meshed really well with my ex personality-wise, and I am only remembering the good parts of him and our relationship, thus making my current relationship pale in comparison.",,False,,t5_2s90u,1368647207.0,,,True,t3_1ee49l,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1ee49l/i_19f_am_overglorifying_my_previous_relationship/,

I'll start by explaining why I chose that then, and move upward.

So, basically, my older sister had a pretty good list of traumatic experiences she formed at school around the 7th grade. As a result, my mom chose to homeschool me.

The problem with this is that she was also a lazy mongrel, so all she did was ""unschool"" me, and by the time I was 13 I knew nothing other than basic arithmetic and reading and writing. I also had no friends, save one who I'd met earlier that year at the library and whom I've never truly liked.

So around that time, I ended up fighting with my mom a lot over my wanting to go to school. Finally she gave in, and so I went. The problem was that prior to then I had something of a superiority complex, and yet I then came to now I was hilariously far behind. Within a week I had a nervous breakdown.

So then I ended up getting transferred to an alternative class mostly full of kids who're getting homeschooled anyway but want an official diploma. I did okay, but I was such an socialized subhuman that the teacher assumed I was autistic, to the point of guessing I must already have a diagnosis.

During that Summer I tried to kill myself with pills, and the response from my parents was that I was going through some sort of emo phase and nothing more.

The next year, I was starting the 9th grade and as such transferred to the HS equivalent of the same program. I'm still there. I hate everyone there, with a passion. They're the absolute filth and waste of the species. Funnily enough, that program is based on the second story of an alt. HS, and I actually get along really well with the people downstairs. My mom will not let me go downstairs though, of course.

So basically I went from wanting friends and schooling to having no friends but a little schooling to having no friends and not being able to do schooling too well because of how much crap the other students give me. 

I also fight with the teacher a lot--it sometimes gets to the point where he won't help me with questions simply because I didn't write a full equation, just the necessary digits and the answer. 

I've spoken to the principal, and both she and the teacher agree that I would do better in normal classes. We're all meeting on the 28th, my parents included, and I'm not sure how to get my mom to permit me to go downstairs. This is fucking ridiculous--the curriculum where I'm at is shitty, all those I get along with, including a girl I'm crushing on are downstairs and I'm probably going to have to either move out or drop out and just go straight to college.

We're very happy together; we rarely argue, and when we do it's more of a debate. For example, if she doesn't get her way, there's no ridiculous things like withholding of sex. We're both very committed to this relationship, and would never cheat on one another.

However, I recently transferred from a community college we were both attending to another one a state away. She stayed behind to finish her education there while I continued mine. Prior to this, we were together every day. I lived 10 minutes away from the college, so she'd regularly stay the night and we'd sit around and play video games or go on walks and stuff if the weather was nice.

After moving and getting into the swing of a new college, I got really anxious about not being with her. I wasn't really worried, it was just strange being alone. I went back to see her on the weekends, which filled that void, and everything worked out alright.

It's been about six months since that happened, and I guess other guys assume she's available. She rarely speaks to anyone and prefers to not have any friends at all, seeing as how past ones have screwed her over and taken advantage of her. She started talking to a guy in one of her classes. Normally I wouldn't care about this, but he's moved incredibly fast in their friendship; she's already been to his house a few times, she seems to talk to him more than she does me, even when she's with me. Constantly texting him, talking to him online. All the time.

I trust this girl with my life, and I'm absolutely positive she would never cheat or let this guy get too close. The problem is that he's absurdly assertive and has already admitted to her that he sees her more as a friend even though she's with me. I had already disliked him before this, but this really took the cake. Comments, flirting, and what seem like attempts at romancing. Like I said before, I trust her with my life, and I know she'd never do anything with him. I've openly stated to her that I seriously dislike this guy, and she's repeatedly told me I have nothing to worry about. I know for sure I don't, but it bothers me and I'm constantly jealous. I try to push him out of my mind, but it just seems like they're constantly talking. He even showed up to the place where we usually hang out on the weekends and talked to her outside. I'd really like to punch this dude in the throat. She's realized that my dislike is natural, but the level of jealousy is not. We're going to have a serious talk this weekend about it.

I've been bouncing questions off the wall, wondering how I prepare for this. Proper questions, answers, and how to set aside the jealousy.

I work two jobs so that she could have her dream job of being a stay home mom.  I scoffed at this for a long time, but when the time was ""right"" I agreed that it was the best road to go down.

A year into her being a stay home mom, she picked up WoW again.  I encouraged it, both as a great hobby and to work on her social life.  She just isn't really good at making friends in the real world.  Once she started playing she started talking to Kay (m).  The three of us would play WoW together years ago, and she was very happy to talk to this person again.  I was too, for awhile.

(this seemed like a good spot to put this information) Her family lives on the other side of the country.  She randomly approached me to ask about the next time we take the trip, if she could go by herself for a few days to visit another relative.  That she wanted to catch up by herself.  I knew this relative, so it wasn't anyone made up.  I declined based on safety reasons and that led to a minor argument (This comes into play later...)

I was working nights until sunrise, and when I'd come home her cell phone would still be hot or she would have just gotten off of it.  Or she'd complain about being tired, but she was on the computer late with Jay playing the game.  I started to suspect something when I was bringing her phone to her after the kids brought it to me.  It had a few missed texts, and another popped up when I was walking it to her.  Sadly, curiosity got the best of me.

There was nothing too incriminating on the surface.  A few playful flirts, but it was hard to get her to even text me throughout the night, and here she was, talking to this person all night.  I kept it to myself, I didn't want her to think I was spying and I sure as hell didn't want to her to think I didn't trust her.  But that deep dark rush kept building inside of me, and one day it finally got the best of me...

I got home one morning and the house was a complete mess.  At the time we only had one computer and I was curious what time she logged out of the chat program that morning.  Sure enough, it was a few hours before I got home from work.  This angered me  because it was -her- job to be with the kids all day while I slept, so that I could go back to my 14 hour job.  That burning itch started up, so I looked in the history folder and saw a jpeg.  There was my wife, in her underwear posing for a camera.  Also a picture of a shirtless Jay, and a link to a website titled ""Sexy pictures of xxxx"" (my wife).  I was shaking.  Angry.

A slight sidebar - We have had an interesting sex life over the years we've been together.  If we were able to have sex more than once every two weeks it was a miracle.  Different reasons would always come up, and it could be anything, justified or not.  But I always felt like that was a soft spot for me.  (as most men do)

I got ahold of Jay instantly on the game, and discussed my concerns.  How this wasn't ""okay"", I didn't appreciate this at all, and I will be talking to my wife about this.  His first concern was how I figured it out rather than an apology.  Of all the possible replies, I didn't have a stock answer for that.  But my voice got louder and my wife came out and we spent a good couple hours talking.  She played it off like she just wanted an opinion, which I slowly bought and I regret that I didn't continue the fight.

The months worn on.  For the weeks afterwards things were great, I was getting attention (talking/texts/kiss at the door), but it all started to roll back to how it was before.  Staying up late talking, talking on the phone, etc.  

My biggest concern is my children.  I feel like they aren't getting the best they could get due to her negligence.  Secondly I worry that I'm being completely taken advantage of.  Allowing her to have her ""dream"" has turned into every stereotype that I feared when I hear ""stay home mom"".  

TLDR:  husband feels he let an online relationship form between his wife and her friend, and is unsure how to combat it without damaging his children's future.

I am a confident, good looking, well put-together guy. I have always been a great and loving boyfriend, who puts a great deal of effort into showing affection, being empathetic, and tending to my loved ones' needs. I don't push too hard, I don't cling or hang onto every day with a panicked ""she's going to leave me"" death-grip. I simply try to be loving and exactly what I'd expect an amazing SO to be for me.

I'm the type of guy who texts the girl I love when I'm thinking about her, responds to her within the hour if she texts me even when I'm busy, brings flowers to her twice a month or so, takes her out on dates every week or two, and has minimal confrontation. I will communicate with her if something minor is bugging me about the relationship, I will listen if something I've done has upset her, and I will never raise my voice (and especially my hand) to the woman I love.

With all of this being said, I think the one major flaw I have in relationships is that I'm permanently trying to keep things in a ""state of honeymoon"", even after several months. I get comfortable with someone, just like anyone else would, and get used to their great attributes, their quirks, and their flaws. But despite this, my mind constantly wants to keep things fresh and exciting, almost like I think I've got to be the perfect guy from any romantic comedy who is stuck in the state of smiling, always being charming, constantly romancing, and always wanting to have some sort of physical hand-holding or subtle arm-rubbing whenever I'm with the girl I love.

I was an only child whose parents divorced when I was five. They had split custody of me, lived close to each other, and I usually split weeks in half at each house. Neither parent was home much because of their work schedules, and I probably spent more time alone growing up than anyone I know. The pros of this are that I am extraordinarily independent, and learned to take care of myself from a very young age. The cons are that I didn't have siblings or many peers to learn from, relate to, or seek advice from when I was curious about the basics of life. Most of what I learned about any type of relationships were through TV and movies, which undoubtedly gave me a skewed outlook on what I should expect from others, and what was expected of me as a man.

I learned many things the hard way, including the sad fact that there is not nearly as much ""insta-karma"" that happens to bad or good people as is portrayed in a movie or sitcom. Shitty people don't always ""get what's coming to them"" in real life, and many great and unselfish people may spend an entire lifetime not getting the recognition they deserve. But I digress.

Despite the occasional overwhelmingly disappointing realizations about reality, which most peers had either long since accepted for what they were, or learned years before I did, I grew up as a fairly secure and normal guy. Though I was admittedly more fragile than the average joe, I was fully aware of what adjustments would be necessary in order to live a normal life and create healthy relationships. I've often attracted some stunningly beautiful women, which I'd introduce to my close friends, who in turn would be absolutely floored. I was never one to sleep around, and I'd often be berated by friends when I refused to take women home who were clearly itching for a forgettable one night stand with me. But these types of flings have never been for me. I have always wanted love and companionship, nothing else. Knowing this, when I brought women back to meet my friends or family, they knew it was because we were actually very seriously interested in each other.

Because of my loneliness as a child, I grew up cherishing the truly close friendships and romantic relationships I'd have. Much more than most people, but not to an unhealthy degree. This finally brings me to my point about my issue. Once in a relationship, I basically have one gear. I give it my all and am an absolute perfectionist with my role as a boyfriend. Part of the reason is that I paint such a great picture of myself for them over the first few months, that showing that I have faults and am not always ""prince charming"", is simply unacceptable to me. I need things to be just right for me and my SO, and I've of course learned that they rarely are. I simply don't know how to relax and know that someone won't abandon me when I do. When I create such a high precedent for them, I can't help but see their disappointment when I slip up on occasion.

The best advice I was given was by my father, who also noticed the amazing girls I seemed to become romantically involved. He told me to hold on to them like I'd hold onto soft sand. Many of you have heard the analogy... Don't hold on too tight or they'll slip through your fingers, don't hold on too loose or they'll fall out of your hand. I took this advice very seriously, and it seemed to have merit as I began applying it to my relationships. But after anywhere from four to eight months, the relationships always seemed to crumble. I always seemed to become content right as the girl I'd fallen in love with began to have doubts. This led to some very awful breakups that often blindsided me and pushed me into months of depression.

I have been dumped in all six of my ""serious"" relationships. Every one of them have ended with my particular SO in tears, telling me something along the lines of ""it's not you, it's me..."" or ""you deserve someone better..."" They're always genuine when they tell me this, I know they are genuine, and to my knowledge none have ever cheated on me. They usually attempt to keep me in their lives in some sort of capacity for a short period of time as a friend, I try to oblige as painful as it is for me, and after a few weeks, they tell me its too difficult for them, and we never speak again. I'll often try and reconcile with them months or even years later, but it's usually still too difficult for them to have a sincere conversation with me even after an elongated period of time. It's both flattering and heartbreaking for me, but none of the bittersweetness makes me feel any better when looking back at the heartbreaks I've experienced.

I've noticed that the few times a girl actually parted ways from me with a criticism, I'd hold onto those words, and work extremely hard to make sure I'd never make the mistakes again. If someone told me I wasn't always a great listener, any time the next girl I dated began telling me about her day, I overcompensated and dropped whatever I was doing to make sure I heard every word of what she said. Of course, I'd realize that this was just me ""holding on too tight"" by overcompensating, so I toned these things back after realizing them, and nothing like this was ever a thing that compromised a relationship. But the point is that I am extremely critical of myself, and will often play over and over in my head what I need to do better for next time. This is extremely challenging when you're making few mistakes to begin with, and nothing big enough for anyone to actually be honest with what these mistakes are when parting ways with me. All of this has really given the abandonment and trust issues I'm aware of, a run for their money.

Recently, a friend of mine brought up a point about me which had never occurred to me before. She said that I seem to have a difficult time being fully comfortable with someone, and letting go of the ""getting to know someone"" phase (aka honeymoon period). I'm so intent on impressing them, not in an overbearing way, but in a constant way which seems to build me up, build me up, build me up... but never fully shows them the true me. Because of this, they eventually realize they can't continue a relationship that never seems to fully peak or have a definition to it. From their perspective, if I had to guess, it feels as though they're dating someone for months who they've known for a week or two, and it's fresh and exciting the entire time... But it never seems like we fully know each other, because of the lack of drama, substance, and ""real moments"". My relationships are just a constant state of me trying to impress, they appreciate it, but never feel like they're returning the favor because all I want to do is give.

Perhaps, I need to learn to be more selfish. Perhaps my situation is somehow related to the ""nice guys finish last"" theories that so many guys on here and other places, swear by. However, I don't think I fall under this category. I'm a well-rounded smartass with a good sense of humor, who just happens to treat the people he loves with constant respect and admiration. But eventually, I need to make the other people in my life feel like they're impacting my life as much as I'm constantly working on impacting theirs. Excess selflessness can often lead to disappointing results, and I'm very conscious of my behavior leading to the risks of being walked over. But I'm usually pretty good about avoiding those situations.

I know this has been a long read, but for those of you who have stayed with me, especially if you're someone who relates to this, I greatly appreciate it. I'd love to hear any advice or input you have, and I'll be sure to respond to any feedback or comments I see.

**TL;DR - I have very deep relationships which never quite launch past the honeymoon phase. I blame myself for being a bit on the selfless side, because of minor deep-rooted abandonment issues. Looking to learn ways to combat this and better myself for the future.**

The title is basically my main issue. I've realized it during the course of my relationship. I've been with my SO (24/m) since October, so about 6 months. We are happy as can be, in fact, we actually came back from a mini vacation.  He is so patient with me, and for that I am grateful. We try to spend as much time as we can together, given that I have both school and work and he works about 60 hours a week.

But I digress, let me give y'all some examples of my behaviour. 

1. Most recent: he had a guys night last night. I called him when I got out of work, and he told me he was having dinner with the guys. He said he would update me the entire night, but he had to go since his phone was about to die. I told him he didn't *have* to update me, since it's guys night and that would be a nuisance anyway, but he **insisted** that he wanted to update me. Well, throughout the night I had been texting and calling him with no response. I'm sure there's a logical reason like his phone might have died, but I am still really upset and mad at him.

2. Movie night two nights ago with the boyfriend and his roommate. While my SO was making a midnight snack for everyone, I managed to doze off. I woke up to being made fun of by his roommate, which was totally playful, but I felt embarrassed. So in my anger, I turned the playful banter into insults, trying to desperately to defend myself and why I was so sleepy. It sounds really stupid now. 

3. I tend to fall asleep faster than the rest of the group. That being said, this happened one particular night when the SO and his roommate were having friends over. I dozed off on the couch and my SO kindly suggested that he escort me to bed. I felt left out and stormed off into the room myself. He followed me and wanted to ""tuck me in"" (for lack of better words) and I asked him when he was coming to bed. He replied that he would once everyone left, in a couple hours. So I was expecting around 4a-5a. He didn't come to bed until 7am. This upset me, and I got mad at him. Even though it's understandable, he had friends over...

So sue me. Ok, so anyway, zombies scare me. I don't mean like zombie movies scare me; I mean like I have a completely irrational fear of something that I know doesn't exist and I don't know why. My heart speeds up, my breathing rapidly increases, and I have terrible images running through my head of me about to be eaten alive by a zombie. It's ridiculous! And I want to be rid of the fear. I know it sounds dumb, but read on.

I used to love watching zombie movies when I was younger and then ""28 Days Later"" came out and ruined it for me. Suddenly I was seeing and hearing zombies everywhere. Not literally, but for instance when I take out the trash at night I have to run back to the house because I suddenly imagine zombies coming after me and tearing me apart. I go to sleep with the wife and hear something moving around and instantly imagine the zombie that's crawling towards the bed. Of course that sound was just the air kicking on. I haven't felt like this since I was ten or so but something in 28 Days Later shook me and got ahold of something in my psyche, I guess, because that's when I remember it really changing to an unnatural fear. What the heck is wrong with me.

I obviously know there is no such thing as zombies. Weirdly enough I don't have problems with other types of ""monster"" things. I can watch Aliens or the like with absolutely no issues. I don't even think about those types of things after watching. As a matter of fact watching a ""zombie"" sci-fi flick, where there are aliens that are treated as zombies that doesn't bother me. But for some reason if it's zombies like ""The Walking Dead"" I am just freaking terrified.

The really sad part about this is I love the idea of zombies and the world after a pandemic like disease and how we'd survive or try to thrive. So it makes me sad that I can't watch things like ""The Walking Dead"". Reading is about the only thing I can do to get that fix. Reading doesn't seem to do anything for my fears. So I try to get my kicks there.

So I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences an irrational fear like this. Or if there is a word for it? Should this be in some other subreddit that I just don't know about? Any suggestions to get rid of this stupid fear or am I stuck?

BTW: Yes I've tried just sitting through a movie since just to force myself to get over it, but that didn't work, if nothing else it gave me more images to replay in my mind as I ran for my life from taking out the trash!

Also, one other BTW. This is just a stupid fear that I can live with. I'm not trying to belittle anyone with real irrational fears that cause them deep emotional stress or that messes with their ability to function. I understand those things are real and are real issues that destroy peoples' lives. This is just a stupid thing that I have to live with and I get that.

He plays competitively and is in a team and is also admin for various websites. He lives for this particular game and his passion for it is something I love but lately its been too much. 

When we met he was on a break from gaming as his internet connection was not adequate. And we spent alot of time getting to know each other. I knew he was into competitive gaming but since I did not know much about it at the time it didn't bother me. Then we were long distance for a couple of months and in that time he got back into the community. 
And over the past year his role has evolved and he now spends alot of time with admin work aswell as playing.

I do play also but only casually I have other hobbies  and university while this seems to be his most passionate hobbie. But he works full time (40 hours) and then comes home (we live together) spends an hour or two on the net and having dinner with me and then spends the rest of the evening playing often until early morning.  

I don't know if I am over reacting by wanting him to spend more time with me as I can see how much this means to him and he plays in a team and his team mates are all committed to playing scrims nearly every-night but they are all single and he is the only one with a girlfriend. I have tried to be supportive and have gotten more involved with the game aswell. I play with him sometimes But our relationship is beginning to diminish as we dont really have deep conversations anymore. And barely go out together as he doesn't really like to socialise  with my friends. He never used to be like this and now he is just so involved I feel like hes forgotten about me.

I'm currently in my eighth month of living abroad in France. I've been single since 2010 when my last (and only) serious boyfriend cheated on me. I had a few flings and a fwb situation in the year after that happened because I was angry at the world and somehow sickly wanted to get back at him. It honestly took me a while to get over that but about a year after we broke up I found myself quite at peace with myself and the whole situation and haven't really given it much thought since.

Another hurdle I had to get over was my eating disorder. I was bulimic for years, and had very serious body image issues. I worked with a counselor for a very long time and came to a point about a year ago where I started feeling really good about myself- and at this point, I feel really great about myself and am quite confident. 

So for about the last year I've been in a really good place, and have been actively but not desperately seeking a relationship, because I feel like I'm ready. But I'm coming up with nothing. I had a few really bad dates last winter but since then... nothing. 

I've kept a pretty optimistic outlook about the whole thing, and worked hard to build a satisfactory life for myself, traveling, living abroad, studying, making strong friendships and learning a lot about myself. I just get lonely sometimes and wish I had someone to share a lot of these experiences with. I've just gotten no response. I've been striking out all over. It's recently becoming a bit depressing, honestly. I actively try to keep a positive attitude, that I just haven't met the right person yet. I guess it just gets hard sometimes when it's been so long. I'm moving back to the states in a month and I'm hoping getting home that I might meet someone in the next year, but I start to wonder if there's something wrong with me that I'm not aware of that seems to just repel possible partners.

I just needed to get this off my chest.
I (F 20) have been dating my boyfriend (M 20) for year. I had never had such strong feelings for a person in my life. I fell head over heels in love! 

Before my boyfriend and I started dating, he would smoke weed here and there. I'm just uncomfortable about it in the legal sense. I never really had a good or bad opinion about it. I didn't really mind it. But he told me he was stopping smoking weed for good, which made me incredibly happy. It put the worry out of my head. He was working at a summer camp with children, so he had to quit anyways. 

After dating for about 4 months, I was incredibly sick with mono. (I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy). He kept me company while I was sick through texting. Throughout the conversation, I found out he had smoked a few times since he got back from camp. Just by the friends he was with, I knew he was going to smoke that night. I was surprised and hurt. I wasn't so much hurt that he was smoking, more hurt that he lied to me about it. I guess it wasn't so much a lie, but leaving out the truth all those times since he came back. I remember him telling me he got sick from it and I didn't even feel bad. I was so mad. 

We had a long talk about it. He knew I felt hurt and lied to. After a few long talks, he agreed that he wasn't going to smoke for awhile. He knew he broke a huge area of trust. He said if he wanted to smoke, he would talk to me about. He didn't want me to be hurt about it again. 

Fast forward to December. It's just before Christmas and we're at a friend's house. I saw a text (by accident!) that said, ""Down to smoke?"". My heart dropped into my stomach. I felt so stupid. We didn't stay too much longer because I wanted to talk to him about it. After a really quiet car ride home with my sister and boyfriend, we arrived back at my house and I confronted him about the text. He told me they were smoking cigars, which was truthful. He does smoke cigars with his friends. I felt terrible for accusing him. He felt so bad, he almost was crying because he saw how hurt I still was over the whole incident. 

We've talked about it a few times. He feels really bad over it. He tells me he didn't even think about how it effected me. I try not to bring it up, it either goes, ""I fucked up, I know!"" or he just feels terrible. 

I don't want to make him feel terrible, but **I still get panic attacks over the whole thing**. If he's with a friend who I know smokes, I get worked up thinking he's going to smoke behind my back with them or something like that. Or ""what if it wasn't cigars that night?"" And then, like today, **I feel terribly guilty that I can't let it go. I don't know how**. 

My boyfriend has done plenty to prove that he is serious about it. He said he hasn't smoked since that day. He says it's hard when his friends offer it, but the relationship is worth more than weed. He keeps telling me that and I wish I could get it through my head that he values me more than pot. He's been there for me though good and bad. He's treated me better than anyone else has. He's so excited about planning out our upcoming anniversary. He always tells me how adorable I am and that I've made his life so happy. He's even held me during a panic attack. He's a really good guy. I know no one is totally perfect, I should be able to let this go.

As I type this, I feel like such an asshole. **I should be able to let it go, but I don't know how**. I know trust doesn't come back instantly. How do I let this go? I feel like I would be so much happier if I could get this out of my head. I love him and do not want to break up with him, especially over something like this.

*(To be clear, I'm not upset over the weed. I'm upset about getting hurt. I'm not trying to start a pro-weed or anti-weed debate!)*

We've been living together a few years and have dated for many more than that. There have been some good times, and then some bad times. We could play our own personal version of the oppression olympics. To summarize, I was overly flirtatious for a period, mostly because she was cold to me, which made her even icier. I realized I fucked up, and tried to move forward, but she didn't really make it there. We move in, and there are more issues. Meanwhile, I've started to cope with the frigidity more and more by using opiates. I'm not physically addicted at the moment, but it does not take that much heroin to put me back on the train. 

And so less than ideal relationship on many levels, but all the same, I really liked what we have/had. We had some form of a relationship. I loved her being around, and hanging out and relaxing with her on one hand, and I've got massive amounts of resentment against her on the other hand. She says she loves me more than anyone in the world, but then here is what shattered what we did have:

Last January, I was browsing her computer, typed in craigslist, and a 'manage your post' came up under missed connections. It was to a guy she had met at a concert (that it turns out, I had taken her to). I thought WTF, but maybe it was just a fantasy, I'll let it slide. About a month later, I am sitting in the living room, and her phone gets a series of texts. I pick up her phone and see it is from some guy asking her to go out again. I'm hoping again that it is the wrong number, and just delete the texts and tell her nothing about it. Then, I take her to an old-timey jam at my friend's place, where I can see her connecting with a guy. Again, that's pretty harmless. She begins contacting the guy, ostensibly to make tshirts. No big deal. She has him over when I'm not there, no big deal. Then she asks me to go to this concert of his, indifferent as to whether or not I come. I like playing music with him, and so I figured I'd see his band. When I'm there, I can see that he is surprised to see me and my spidey sense was tingling. I had school the next morning and went home with my partner, and am woken up around 3am by my dog barking. I go down and see my girlfriend had just invited that guy over. The first thing he asks me was ""why did you come to the show?"" In a drunk, bastardly sort of way. I had to refrain from smashing his head with the baseball bat we keep handy. Fucking rude. My (ex)girlfriend kicks him out. 

So now I start putting things together, and I ask about the missed connection. It turns out that she went out on a date with him. She says it was not a date, but to me, placing a missed connection, getting a response, taking them to a movie, and having a beer is a date. Especially since the initial message was flirty. They've stayed in contact. I made her show me her facebook, and his messages are filled with pet names etc. She says it is nothing, but to me it is a betrayal. Same with the music guy. I saw it coming, and individually the things are innocent, but to me, getting dolled up for a guys show, sending him a series of texts afterwards saying: 1. ""That was gorgeous. Entirely my pleasure."" 2. ""Yes, I'm still up just abiding in my bathrobe with my dog."" 3. ""Come over to watch TV, I'll meet you at the door."" do not seem like how one goes about creating a platonic friendship (at 3am, when drunk). 

I am so hurt now. Even if she has done nothing, she has been a pathological liar, she claims since her grandmother got a stroke, and I believe nothing. We had no trust, and we had no real intimacy, but we had something. Now, my trust is further shattered, there is even less intimacy, and what we had is now broken. I am hurt so incredibly much by this. I go through a period where I'm philosophical and think that we just need to admit that this was not to be, and then I feel really sad because I don't want to lose her. 

How would one even consider repairing a relationship like this. I've kicked her out of the house. Her stuff is here and upsets me. It will upset me more when I am in an empty house with no furniture, no money, and no her. She obviously has issues with me and I with her. 

How would one plausibly start to fix something like this? Our dogs are best friends, and it would be sad to separate them. She wants us to 'work on our friendship first', while still living together. I say that a friend would not have done this behind my back and made me felt betrayed. (She has a thing for missed connections, she did something similar last year too, but supposedly never met up with that guy).

TL;DR I'm sorry for the wall, but I just want actual advice on how a relationship that has turned into Israel v Palestine like this could be fixed. I can see for myself everything that is wrong with the situation. But I liked what we did have.

Afraid to fuck up.,Smne,6,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1b47zj/m17_being_torn_apart_with_what_to_do_about_about/,"Let me start by the fact that i grown up almost without father as i kicked him from my life at the age of 10 since he was a liar who was stealing money from everywhere he could (and my mom too). 
My mother was borderline crazy during the time where she had to support me + dumbshit my father did (has to run away from home 2 times and sleep outside) and i got bullied while i was in middle school so ... i was really fucked up emotionally and had big problems with relationships friendly or not.

Which led us to S, my first real love, she was a classmate of mine during last year of middleschool and in love with me but i thought it was another joke on me so i told her to gtfo (yeah..) ... I asked her out the next year but it didn't lasted longer than 1 month because i dumped her, then went again for her and was acting weird. 
I hated her for it but i lately (just 1 week ago tbh) realised that i was the one who was being an emotional wreck all the time and acting like someone you don't want to be in a relationship with and it wasn't her being a bitch. It hits hard. 
She even tried to go out with me several times even staying at my bus stop every friday to try to make up things with me but i would always ignore her. I told her she was a slut because i was a butthurt teenager and it hurt her, stopped talking for 2 years after that.

I then met my GF who was as fucked up as i was and we broke up 2 times in the span on 3 months but got back again and never left each other. She got better thanks in part to me and same for me, i'm almost normal now and i have many friends n shit like a normal teenager, i am no longer a big introvert either. 
Things were great for a solid year. 

So here are the problems : 

She(gf) stopped acting like we were dating and we were best buddies (people would always say we looks more like buddy than a couple) Needless to say my feelings for her started going really down and i talked to a mutual friends of her about it to fix things (since when i would talk to her about it she would just start crying and i would be feeling too much guilt to keep going). It worked... for a time. Now i'm just like her father but we're fucking. She complains all the fucking time, her family is crazy as a whole (they are cool with me tho) and there are many other problems but which are minors compared to the main issues.

Although she is a FANTASTIC person (i can't say it enough.. really) and very understanding, smart, patient and everything you seek in a person...I'm no longer her bf, she is glued to me and don't act like we're in a relationship, i'm her first bf and she thinks we will stay together forever no matter what... not really what i'm into to be honest and i told her, especially since it is possible that i move 2 hours from where i live the next year... things were shaky for a while but it went k.
She went from 50kg to 68kg for 1m65 since the first time i saw her and well let's say it took a bit of my attraction to her away (i prefer skinnier girls to be honest). 
I don't love her as much as i used to for reasons described above + other things but i am still VERY attached to her since it's been already 2 years and just thinking about breaking up makes me cry inside and very fast outside. I know breaking up will hurt her like no tomorrow and i feel so much guilt for it, but in the same time it's not really a relationship for me anymore, more like someone i have to support with her constant need of approval by others, her complains, her problems etc .. I get pissed off by her lifetelling every day but i didn't told her because i don't want to hurt her and she has always been supportive to me no matter what (even when i got mono in last october and couldn't go out for 2 months because of the sick, and i'm still sick...) so i feel a bit of a jerk to complain about it.

Still, many many of her friends clearly stated to her and/or me that they would bang me any day and were really attracted to me (even one i only saw as a friend for 2 years told me 2 days ago she would have tried to ask me out if i wasn't with my current GF... disturbed me a bit).

S and I recently started to talk again after i apologised for being a dumbass all this time and well after seeing that i'm no longer the weirdo of middle school she talks to me a lot about the past when we were together and a lot about the past, and talk to me a lot in general + give me obvious signals i choosed to ignore that she's free.
Her LDR BF tried to fuck up my relationship with my current gf (that he knew back in the day) by sending her mails saying i was cheating on her in english (i'm french) with S so i would stay away from S and forbad S from having a facebook because he can't see what she does on fb.. I never knew him so i guess she talked about me to him one day or another.

Now i don't know what to do, i'm torn up, i think my relationship isn't as great as it used to be and i can't fix it anymore. I had many temptations from other girls but i didn't failed for it because i'm not a cheater and my gf don't deserve it AT ALL (and the breakup too ..) BUT i must say that S still attract me since well, she's still beautiful (to me at least, she's my type of girl) and we have a lot of fun together.
But i know what i loose if i quit my current gf, a fantastic person which is just unexperienced in relationships and do a lot of mistakes but i don't know what i win and i'm scared that i'm over valuating the pros over the cons because i don't know them well enough. Still, i don't know if i'm really ready to support such a relationship at my early age where i still dont know shit of the life and not resent it later and put the blame of my gf. It's a really hard decision i don't want to fuck up, but it looks like there is no good decision at all in this situation.

(I use big words to sound smart)

Anyways Some Background, I'm 23, male, living at home (felt I should include this) and I live in Toronto (don't know why I included this).

I'll try to keep this as short as possible, I see a lot of threads that are somewhat similar but for some reason I feel as if my situation is a little different. 

My whole life has pretty much been spiraling out of control for the past 6 years, and I really want things to change. I come from a decent, well-off family, my parents own their business, we have a nice home, I have good family/friends, I should be a happy person, and I do put up that front on the outside, but there are things making me unhappy that I would really like to fix. 

Firstly, and most importantly, I flunked out of university at 18, and have never made any attempt or concentrated effort to get back into a school. It's as if I just don't care anymore at this point. I've been helping run my parents company but this is definitely not what I want to do with my life. If I could get accepted into a school tomorrow, I'd do my absolute best to stick it through and finish, I just can't bring myself to take those first steps again. 

Next, maybe just as important, I've never been in a relationship, kissed a girl, or had sex. I know 23 is still young, but I've been living a lie, nobody knows this truth, all my friends just assume that I'm not a virgin, and I pretty much have a bunch of made up stories to corroborate this. The thing is, I don't want to sound full of myself, but I'm a pretty attractive person, I'm fairly intelligent (aside from flunking out of school which was more of a motivation thing), I have money (to put it bluntly) and I know girls that are and have been interested in me. For some reason it just hasn't happened, I don't know if it's a lack of confidence, if I just don't feel the same way about them or what. It's not that girls don't like me, I have never asked a girl out and been rejected, I just haven't asked, maybe because I'm really shy but other than that I don't know why.

These are the main things I am worried about right now, and it's gotten to the point where I would really appreciate any sort of advice or input whatsoever regarding these, I feel a bit embarrassed talking to someone I know about this, because they are all under the impression that I finished school, know/talk to/hook up with girls, and actually have my life together. I'm the person people talk to about problems, with everything, family, work, relationships etc. If they actually knew how full of shit I was about everything, I dunno. I really hope it's not too late for me to turn my life around.

**TL;DR  23, flunked out of school, virgin, want to fix my life, need some sort of motivation? Help!**

I am 28 year old male in the southern California area (would love to leave) and I have tried eharmony, match, clubs (in SLC,UT no less) and my luck just seems to suck.

I have Aspergers and don't use drugs at all (hate even using morphine for busted bones), do smoke and am really good with computers, enjoy going out and watching trains go by.

Something that has stopped me from really pursuing dating (as pointed out by my sister) is that I seem to think that all women will be controlling like my mother is. (Little backstory I have had issues with my mother as she has tried to run my life, not full on, but tries to get me to do things and using guilt trips to try and get her way) On top of that the Aspergers causes me to miss a lot of common social cues.

My sister was saying goodbye to her friends at a club in SLC and I was there with her. I happened to start roaming around and this woman came up to me and started to flirt. At first I didn't notice but then she asked me if she should go get her glasses and my brain just locked up. It was like my brain just committed a BSOD. I didn't know what to do. My sister just happened to call me over and ask me to take pictures.

Basic background: I'm studying in the US after having made the decision to uproot myself from my hometown, Singapore. I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome when I was serving my mandatory 2 years in the Army by an army psychiatrist following severe bullying by enlisted men and officers alike.

So, I was browsing Facebook for a while and found the above linked article being discussed. The ""creep"" label isn't unfamiliar to me because whenever I attempt to express my interest in women and ask them out, they either laugh in my face or fling the ""creep"" label to me. Reading the article and seeing my friends discuss it on how ""men need to stop whining and get over themselves"" etc. just re-opened that wound in me that had closed up a long time ago, and I don't know whom I can talk to about it.

Most people I know respond with genuine surprise when I inform them of that fact about me, because years of therapy has trained me to mesh well with society on an absolutely platonic level. However, I am really, REALLY bad at expressing my interest to women I gravitate towards. 

Sure, even if I'm an extreme introvert and need a lot of alone time to myself, that doesn't mean that I don't need human contact, too. Neither does it mean that I don't have any need to find someone to be with on a level that is more than friendship. I'm certain that there are people here who will tell me to stop whining and ""get over myself"", but how the fuck am I supposed to do that when my brain's fundamental structure is different from nearly everyone else around me? 

There are sometimes no words to describe how incredibly fucking lonely I feel and I try to numb it by throwing myself into video games and academia. In multiplayer video games, I get the social interaction I need and in academia I get fulfillment of some kind when I receive praise for my work and get asked to attend more conferences than I can keep count.

1362979347.0,5,self.ihaveissues,1a2f4m,All of my friends think I'm a slut ... am I? [18F],whitehandsinkstains,6,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1a2f4m/all_of_my_friends_think_im_a_slut_am_i_18f/,"A quick disclaimer: I don't agree with the word slut. I consider sex and sex-related acts a very positive thing, and I don't think there's a point where you're having too much sex, or with too many different people, unless you're not being safe or it's affecting you emotionally.

So, I admit, I hook up fairly regularly. I don't have PIV sex with strangers, and as far as I've gone with someone I first met that night was heavy petting. But when I drink, or when I don't drink, I just like sex. I like kissing. I like giving head. I like receiving head. I'm a very touchy person, so when I'm around someone I'm attracted to, I want to touch them. Usually, I do touch them. Putting my arm around them, grabbing butts (of my friends who I know are okay with it), that sort of thing. I like to dance, so I wind up dancing with people.

But in terms of hooking up, I usually like to hook up with people who are friends of mine. I trust them to be clean, first of all, but I also trust them emotionally. I'm comfortable around them, enough that I don't feel awkward, and I can make jokes with them, that sort of thing. It's unfortunate, though, because almost all of my attractive male friends are in band with me, so they all know each other, and hang out with each other, and talk to each other.

I know it's bad that I'm less discriminate than the average pristine young American woman. I know it's worse that the people who I hook up with know each other, and that they talk to each other about me. But I don't mind that people call me a slut, or think I get around, or whatever. I talk about it regularly. I don't mind people knowing the details of my sex life. In fact, I'd rather they hear it from me than from a third-hand source.

Last night, though, one of the guys from band, one who's actually a fairly good friend of mine, sort of -- had a thing with me? I don't know how to describe it. We walked home from a party together, spent a long time talking about the fact that we didn't want to hook up, that he felt uncomfortable and didn't want to go too far, that I liked him more than just someone to hook up with, all that and more. We made out, went to his place, made out more, and slept together -- literally, just slept together, snuggling, because we were both into that and not anything more.

But I told one of my close friends about what happened, and she said all these things about 'not liking it', how I need to 'broaden my horizons and stop hooking up in the same group', how 'I need to calm myself', and 'think about consequences of my actions'. She didn't mean any of it harshly, and I'm not in any way upset at her, but it frustrated me for a couple reasons.

1) I don't care that people talk about me behind my back, while she's offended on my behalf when she hears people saying things about my proclivity.

2) (and more importantly) This is the first guy in a while that I've not only 'gone home with' with the express intent of NOT having sex or doing anything remotely sexual, but that I've had a legitimate romantic interest in. If the opportunity presented itself, I would date him in a heartbeat, because he clearly doesn't seem to mind my history, and if it doesn't bother him, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. And yet this is the guy that my friends think is me 'crossing the line'. Not someone I met online, not someone who was thrown at me at a party, not the random stranger who I went and smoked with in a faraway apartment without telling anyone, but my good friend who actually seems to really like me. I don't get it.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to hook up with strangers. It doesn't make me happy anymore. If I'm gonna have non-committed sex, I want it to be with my friends. But all of my male friends are in the same group, and apparently I shouldn't touch them. The one guy I'm actually interested in falls into that category, and I'm afraid that my 'reputation' will ruin any chance I might have had. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I hook up with guys who are friends with each other, because they're friends of mine, and I trust them. Now that I've found one I actually like, people are calling me slutty and telling me to keep my distance. I can't tell if I'm in the wrong, or they're in the wrong, or no one is, and all I want is to settle down with one guy I like, who I'm friends with, who I really legitimately like.

I am now aware that belief was completely erroneous. I am aware that many of you will find this belief incredulous. I have asked for help in other forums, and been accused of trolling. I assure you that I'm not. Rather I'm asking for help to gradually recover.

Starting with that one destructive assumption, a whole lot of rationalizations took hold: Women derive no pleasure from sex, but take on partners because of myriad reasons (security, financial, societal pressure, loneliness). A man's job is to provide and care for his woman because she loves him enough to make the ultimate sacrifice of satisfying his animal urges (quite aware now how sexist this sounds). Flirting is the same as harassment. Sexual thoughts about a person who know is very wrong and insulting to them. Deriving pleasure from admiring a pretty girl is despicable and makes me a disgusting person (cue self-hatred). Sexuality is inherently destructive, and my fervent wish was to be free of all of all sexual desire. 

These meant that I feel extremely uncomfortable around women I find attractive. However, this did not prevent me from acquiring female friends I felt little or no attraction towards. In fact, outwardly I come across as a friendly, but prudish individual. 

Now that I've realised how ridiculous all that was. I understand that women are sexual beings too. However, female sexuality is significantly different from the male variety. But I've been struggling to change myself over the past few years. Changing fundamental beliefs is a long and very hard road. The best analogy I can provide is perhaps a devout catholic who suddenly loses his faith and needs to reconsider everything about how the world works.

I'm a 25 year old male, been in therapy for about a year now for anxiety, depression, and self esteem issues. I'd been dealing with those problems since I was a preteen and therapy had been suggested to me before, but it wasn't until last spring that I decided to dedicate myself to treatment. I had, in the past, been extremely anxious and depressed - focusing on death, panic attacks, etc. I had been facing these problems on my own because I wanted to enter therapy with a somewhat clear head, as a conscious decision to improve myself and not as a desperate whim at the depths of my depression, as had been the case in the past. Last spring, I found myself in a place where I felt like it was time to pursue professional help, and I did. I will admit that there has been some improvement in my life. I'm back in college, made the Dean's List with a 3.42 GPA. I go out of my way to be more social, I make a conscious effort to talk to people and try to make friends. I have an RX for 100mg of Zoloft, and, for the most part, I'm not constantly drowning in anxiety like I used to be. Because of this, my therapist says that he thinks we can wrap things up. That, essentially, he's done all he can for me, and the goal is not to be in therapy forever but to be able to move on and support myself etc. My last appointment is scheduled for 2 weeks from now. 

The thing is, this is the second time this has come up. He had mentioned this as a possibility about a month or two ago, and at the time I said that I didn't think i was at that point yet. Now here we are again, and though I understand what he's saying about being self-sufficient, I still don't think we've even begun to scratch the surface of my problems. I have some serious issues with trust/love/sex/women. When I first started attending sessions, he asked me what I was hoping to get out of therapy. I told him that I have never felt connected to anyone or anything, and that what I really want is to be close to someone romantically and emotionally. Apparently he took that as I was looking for dating advice, and gave me a ""play it cool, don't be too available"" speech. My inability to do so aside, I think he kind of missed the point. I'm not looking for tips on how to get laid, I could visit seddit for that. What it boils down to is I feel completely unlovable. I feel fat, stupid, ugly, lazy, socially awkward, and annoying. I know I should work out more, but I don't. It doesn't make me feel good, it doesn't boost my mood or esteem; I still feel as negative as I always do, only I'm physically exhausted have sore muscles too.

I smoke weed multiple times a day, every day. I don't remember the last time I went a whole day without smoking a bowl. The therapist has made a big deal about smoking less, and I have put a minimal effort into cutting back a bit, but my sister is a chronic smoker for her epilepsy and makes it far too easy for me not quit. I want to get my own place, hoping that maybe if I'm not around her all the time it won't be so easy to smoke up whenever I feel like it. But, on the other hand, it's not exactly like I can put it all on her. I like to get high... probably a little too much.



Now, I don't want to be one of those turds who whines about how all girls are crazy and only go after jerks instead of Nice Guys Like Me (TM). I'm very aware that there are plenty of legitimate reasons that a girl might not go for a self-described tubby burnout smart ass.

However, I do find myself, more and more, irrationally resenting the entirety of women. I have never met a woman who hasn't cheated. Literally, none. If you paid me $1000 to write the names of three women who I would trust to be entirely faithful in a committed relationship, I swear to the flying spaghetti monster that I couldn't do it if I had a week. I seriously believe that they are genetically designed to be sneaky, lying, manipulative, shallow, and unfaithful. To secure the best source of DNA for their offspring, and then the best provider - the two rarely being one in the same.

This is not to say that there are no women who are not like this. Or that there aren't any women that I like or respect. Simply that, as a whole, evolution has favored these traits in the gender, and so there is a predisposition to these things. Concepts of honor, loyalty, teamwork, compromise, authenticity; these things are lost on most people today, but at least I've met a few guys who generally seem to value them, never any women. Like I said, I know these thoughts are irrational. I'm not saying them to get a rise out of anybody, I don't like thinking them, I really don't want to draw out a gang of neckbeards from /r/mensrights for a hearty ""preach on brother!"" I'm just giving anyone who might be paying attention some insight into where my issues are leading me. I haven't mentioned these things to my counselor yet. I always assumed they would eventually come but each meeting being 45 minutes every two weeks, things just fall through the cracks I guess. Seems like important stuff to fall through the cracks, but now I'm worried that if I bring it up next time I see him it will seem like I'm just spewing out a bunch of shit just so the meetings won't stop.


My issues with sex are worse than I thought. I always knew I had some, from the time I was a little kid. But they're either getting worse or I'm just now noticing how fucked up my attitudes toward sex have always been. I've always had a high sex drive. I remember being four or five years old and being very curious/knowledgeable for my age. Watching porn, finding dirty magazines, swapping flashes with girls. It was around this age that I was first touched by a couple older girls (I think one was around 12  or 13 the other 14 or 15, probably both victims of abuse themselves) for the first time. I can't necessarily say I hated it but still, it would probably be a safe bet to say that these incidents weren't good for me.



I've always been a bit of an introvert, and dealt with some separation anxiety. The concept of a friend has always been so foreign to me. I remember being in Kindergarten and asking a kid if he wanted to be friends because I heard that was something you were supposed to have. I didn't know what the criteria was so I just asked the kid in front of me on the playground slide. As I got into highschool and puberty kicked in, my libido jumped from over-sexual to hypersexual. My childhood anxieties developed into full-blown depression. My parents' marriage was on the rocks, my mother was out late more nights than not. My father worked in a slate quarry 10 or 11 hours a day, come home, eat dinner, watch tv, and go to bed. We lived in a shitty two bedroom trailer, 2 parents, 2 boys, 2 girls. A 5th was born, turns out dad had a vasectomy after the third. Parents divorced. My mom used to tell me that my father ruined me. My dad used to tell me to not have any kids young like he did. And so I make a conscious decision to not be sexually active until I got out of high school. I was the class clown and not afraid to make a joke and it was a small town so everyone knows everyone. Feeling like poor white trash all the time I kept to myself, stayed home, played a lot of video games, and jerked off too much instead of doing stuff like... ya know... learning social skills, dating, sports, anything that would make me not the person I am today.



Got into college and realized ""Oh shit, I have no idea how to talk to humans."" This was my nice guy phase. This was my ""I called her beautiful instead of hot, why isn't she on my dick?"" phase. I was a liberal arts major, did terribly because I'm considered reasonably intelligent but I'm a horrible student. Dropped out of college after a few semesters before I did irreparable damage to my college transcripts, worked menial jobs for a while. Met a girl at one of these jobs, lost my virginity at 22, got my heart broke, spent a few years dealing with it. I'm finally in a place where I think I'm mature enough to handle a relationship, and I'd like one, but I think this post proves that I'm not quite ready for one, I guess.



So what do I do? How do I move on from here? Tell my therapist that I think we should keep going? He's a good guy, I enjoy our conversations, but I'm not entirely sure he's fully understanding the depths of my problems. Or perhaps he does and he's being dismissive of it.


Anyone deal with situations like this before? What's a good type of therapy to get rid of unwanted prejudices?









**TL:DR**


Therapist says I'm fine. I'm certainly not. Should I get a new one?

I'm a 20 year old male gay/bisexual student. I constantly find myself falling for someone and putting them on a golden pedestal: I think they are amazing, near perfect, no bad qualities etc. This just feeds off of the little (if any) self worth I have for myself, since I do not think that I am good enough, attractive enough, good looking enough to make another person happy.

As a child, I was physically abused by my father, emotionally separated from my mother, and sexually abused by my baby sitter. In high school, I never dated, because I felt I wasn't good enough. Now in college, I've been having these problems become more intense. My body image issues are growing (I can't look at myself and not feel disgusted), I started cutting my wrists, and I went about a week without eating anything.

Now, I don't feel attracted to that many people. And when I find someone attractive, I usually have an intense draw to them. I cannot tell if that's normal, or if those feelings are just what a crush is. I feel as if most people can look around and point out who they find attractive; whereas, I don't find many people attractive and they pretty much just look the same (as in I have a type).

At the beginning of this year, on of my fellow Resident Advisers told me that one of her residents thought I was cute. Of course I just could not believe it, since who could possibly find me attractive? Long story short, I've been talking to this guy, and last Wednesday he came over to my room to watch a movie. Things got a little heated and we started making out (my first kiss at age 20... another reason why I'm pathetic), and I had to stop him when he started taking off my shirt.

Truth is, I wish I felt comfortable about sex and exposing my body. But I just cannot make myself be vulnerable like that. I'm trying to figure out why I said no, since it was all in my head rather than anything to do with him. I'm ashamed about my body, and just wanted to spare the vulnerability of exposing myself to him. This boy is also much more experienced than I am (whether it be in relationships or random hook ups, mostly the latter). I couldn't tell if he was just trying to get with me or if I actually mean something to him.

I'm a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician. I can pull people out of car wrecks without hesitation, but when it comes to relationships and sex, I am a nervous and pathetic wreck myself. What the hell is wrong with me? 

I want to feel worthy and wanted. I just want someone to feel happy just being around me. I don't want to look at myself and find the smallest things to try to change. Tenuous things like trying to whiten my eyes with eye drops, or buying multiple different teeth whiteners. I don't want to be obsessed with perfection anymore.

Everyday I struggle to live my life.  I struggling being unemployed, I struggle living in a foreign country with no friends, no family, and with a controlling self-centered wife.  My heart aches everyday because I have a wife with incredibly low libido, who does not support me working right now if it means I have to leave her side and I feel like she doesn't want to see me happy.  I feel like a worthless piece of shit after being unemployed for 8 months. 

My wife works overseas and I quit my job to come be with her and help her settle and I was hoping to find a job in that country.  However, it has been 8 months and I finally get a great job offer but it would mean we might have to be apart for up to two years and I may never have another opportunity like this again.  She told me to hold off on it but I know part of the reason is because it would also affect her future career advancement.  As if I haven't suffered enough, she asks me to sacrifice again for her!!  What the fuck!  As I'm writing this she is out drinking with her co-workers and I'm stuck at home as I have been all day, everyday for the last 8 months!   

We have separate bank accounts and I've nearly depleted my entire savings account and I may soon have to tap in what little I have in stocks.  I haven't bought anything for myself in almost 6 months (I bought some new shoes today because I have been doing mturk for the last 3 months and finally saved enough)and I don't have any health or dental insurance.

These years are supposed to be the best and they are the worst.  Thank you for letting me vent.  I literally have no body to talk to, I'm horny all the time, I'm depressed, and I have healthy amounts of self-loathing.

I am a widow with 2 kids. No relationships since my husband died a few years ago. All of a sudden, I find some sexual tension between me and a friend [m/48] who I was seeing around often, him being my child's sports coach. He is unhappily married, 3 kids, and completely untouchable due to his job.

One night, late night texting got the better of us, and I drove down to pick him up at his house while everyone there was asleep. We ended up snogging and touching, but nothing else tho he proposed some sex. Dropped him back to his house and I went home (because it was getting late/early).

Now I can't get him out of my head. I think back to that night and I want him so badly. But, again, he's untouchable, and we live in a very very small town. If he did anything else with me, he'd lose his job.

I have a history of obsessive thoughts, and OAG, really. I need to learn how to stop these thoughts, take a step back, and breathe, but I can't seem to do that. I'm going to scare him away if I keep acting like I am, even as a friend. 

At the same time, it's been *years* since I've had sex, and to be honest, I'm going nuts. There are very few available men in this town, and due to the location, it's hard to get away (not including the kids at home) and spend time out of the area.

Back story:

Girl moves across country. Girl meets guy at grad school. Girl flirts with guy, guy flirts back. Coitus. Girl tells guy she just wants casual because emotionally unavailable. Guy fails to understand gravity of situation. Guy and girl stop seeing each other when girl says she calls ex very day for an hour that she was living with before moving. (~Sept. 1st- Nov. 5)

Guy and girl meet at bar randomly few weeks later. Coitus. Girl warns to take things slowly. She likes guy, but must return home to tell ex to stop calling. Guy concurs. Guy and girl begin dating. Girl leaves for break. (Nov. 25-Dec. 17)

Girl returns from break upset. Ex threw hail mary, proposed to girl. Girl refused him. Guy and girl see each other on New Years Eve. Girl admits that guy is large reason she said no, and came back across the country for school. Girl says she is falling for guy. 

Guy and girl continue dating as before. Add label of BF/GF at her discretion. Girl tells guy on several occasions she loves him. Guy has walls up and holds off due to previous issues from Sept. 1- Nov. 5. Girl is noticeably stressed out (school, health, ex, friends etc.) Guy eventually says I love you back. ~Jan. 1st-Feb. 9th.

Alright, now I'm gonna drop the girl/guy thing since that was the majority of the back story and explain recent happenings.

At the beginning of last week she seemed particularly stressed, and said she hadn't really slept, then made mention of her old job place having a work party which is where her ex still works. I can read her pretty well and asked a question that would allow her to come clean and she told me that she had called her ex the other night. We sat down and she told me about how depressed she's been and how not talking to him when he was her best friend was making it worse and that she just really felt the need to talk to him. She then shared about all the things that have been leading to her depression, and how I am the best thing going for her out here, and that she didn't want to hurt me. I assured her it was fine, then went outside to shovel some snow, and came back and calmly talked to her. I basically said that I didn't want to prevent her from being friends with her ex, granted I thought that it was a bit more complicated than that with him having just proposed to her. I also just talked about how I really think she needs to gain control of all the things that are negatively affecting her, and think about the positives. She was relieved at my reaction, told me I'm the best, etc etc. 

Valentines Day Massacre... I planned an awesome Valentines Day. I got her the perfect gift that I subtly hinted at through movie choices on nights we'd stay in and watch a movie and drink wine. I took her to a fancy restaurant. Keep in mind she has told me on several occasions she hasn't had a good V-Day in 7 years, so I was going to deliver. We have an *awesome* time. We have a few drinks before dinner, a few drinks after dinner, talk to some fun old couple at a bar, go visit a bartender we both know, then head back to her place. I'm laying in bed, and she goes to write a note to her neighbor about some pyrex she meant to return. While she is in the hall I hear her on the phone. She is talking in a very girlfriendy voice, one she doesn't really use with me, and then I hear her say ""I love you."" My heart just dropped, and kind of did now as I describe this. She comes back in and immediately calls her mom to just chat about Valentines day as she walks around the apartment. Once she's off the phone I ask who she was on the phone with in the hallway. She says it was her mom. I said no, you just started a whole new convo with you mom, and she tries to show me her phone as if she lost connection and called again. I tell her I heard her say to someone ""I love you."" She admitted it was her ex. I just tell her straight up how much bullshit it is that she has been telling me she loves me, that I believed her, and that I finally broke down my walls to tell her how I felt, and beyond that how she did it *right* after I just took her on what she told me was ""the most amazing date [she] had ever been on,"" especially considering that ass hat stood her up last V-day (yeah, I know way too much about him...) I also have a monetary commitment to a vacation with her in a month for Spring Break. Basically, it was a huge WTF. The best part, in mentioning that she has been telling me she loved me for the last almost two months, her explanation was that she was usually drunk (false) and that she felt that I was the type of person that needed to hear that in order to want to stay involved with someone. She told me she didn't mean it, but that she cared a lot about me... That was a solid kick to the groin.

She just starts crying hysterically, borderline panic attack, telling me how terrible she feels, etc etc, starts calling her brother and trying to book a flight home because she just fucked up the only thing she has going for her out here. From there I just rolled over and went to bed. I've talked to her since. She says I'm the one she wants to be with, and that she cares a lot about me, and that she was incredibly drunk and made a huge mistake. I basically sat her down and told her that I don't trust her right now, that she needs to figure her life out, and that we need space. I haven't broken up with her yet, because I know once I do I won't get back together, and I'm kind of hanging on the idea that maybe my resentment will go away and I will be able to trust her again. I have to take into consideration the gravity of the situation that two months ago she was being proposed to, and had no business jumping into a relationship, and that between health, friends, moving, and the ex she has a lot of issues to work out. 

To speak on her behalf, I've never had more fun with someone I've been dating. My friends have consistently pointed out to us that we are male/female versions of each other (except when it comes to kindness and honesty I guess...) Her friends all love me and have been pulling for me, and apparently her parents who haven't even met me are impressed enough by what she's told them about me that they chewed her out when she told them what she did. This is already much too long soo...

**TL;DR** Treat girlfriend to amazing date, she calls ex and tells him she loves him as she is hanging up (old habits die hard...), and then tells me she has been fibbing when she tells me she loves me to make me feel better...

I don't have many opportunities to go out and date just because my life's been so hectic and I'm focused on other things.  There have been 2 people that I fell for pretty hard (and its difficult for me to form romantic attractions because I have little in common with people) but they ended up rejecting me once they learned more about my background. Things ended pretty badly with both of them going back to their exes.

I apologize for any incoherence. 

I have severe anxiety and self esteem issues, as well as depression. I've been taking citalopram 40 mg for almost 2 years, and been in therapy for a year and a half. While I have grown immensely, I still don't feel like I'm okay. I've started having suicidal ideation again (not acted on it), and lately I've found myself crying for no reason, even though I still take my medication.

I went to a Lady Gaga concert with my sister tonight, skipping class for the first time in my academic career to do so. I was so excited about it. My sister (16) is, to put it mildly, a bit of a diva. She kept asking me to take pictures of her, but then would flip out at me if it wasn't absolutely perfect (my hands shake sometimes). I just got so stressed out and upset, and the only way I could enjoy the concert was pretending she wasn't there (once the lights went down, I just ignored her completely and had the best time I could given my mental state). I just couldn't deal with her yelling at me like a servant. I don't even know why it made me so upset. I should have expected it of her, as it was typical for her. I started to have trouble breathing and wanted to step aside for a second to take a xanax, and she kept pulling me every which way. I felt like I was going to pass out if I didn't eat something (as I hadn't eaten since 8 hours before), and she didn't care at all. She's really bossy, to the point where I'm absolutely terrified to say no to her. She'll ask me to get her her remote or turn her lightswitch when she's on her bed, and I fucking do it because I'm so afraid of her screaming at me. It wasn't what she was asking of me, but rather the way she asked it. She talks to me like I'm stupid. And the worst part of it is I'm almost positive that she knows how much it hurts me. 

This spills over into my other relationships. I'm afraid to say no to anyone, and I'm fucking miserable. This is not a normal sibling rivalry. She calls me a psycho just because I get stressed out about college and sometimes snap when I'm overwhelmed (although I certainly don't mean to). She calls me a selfish bitch if I ever say no to her. My parents remind me over and over how my thinking patterns aren't normal. I was at a large family dinner the other night, and really stressed out. I just wanted to scream every time my mother told me to ""act more enthusiastic"". I find that lately all I want to do is crawl into a hole and never emerge from it. I find myself crying in my sleep. 

My parents were angry at us, but mostly me. They keep telling me I'll end up alone if I don't get my act together (which I'm very aware of). They tell me to just suck it up and deal with it. They've called me a freak once or twice. Don't get me wrong, I know my parents love me, but when they remind me of how dysfunctional I am, it hurts so much. They either don't know how much it hurts, or they do but they don't care. They keep asking me ""why don't you talk about this or that in therapy?"". I know what I want to work on, what I want to conquer, what my issues are. It's honestly none of their fucking business what goes on between me and my therapist. I go there because it's a safe place for me, and my family just doesn't seem to understand that. 

I guess the long and short of it is that my anxiety and self esteem issues are still not within my control, and it's affecting my personal life. I just want to be normal. I just want to be happy. I've been content since I started getting help, but I can't honestly say that I know what true happiness is. I need help. These nights crying myself to sleep are exhausting.

Living with him is wonderful, we get along great and never really fight.

The one thing that we do have problems with is completely my fault. Immediately prior to my relationship with my boyfriend, I dated a guy [26m]  for 3 years who was very emotionally abusive. He was overprotective and would constantly scream at me over things that I didn't do. He would turn a tiny thing, like me arriving 10 minutes late, into 3 hours of screaming at me, punching walls, throwing objects etc. This happened at least once or twice a week for our whole relationship. He would sometimes not let me leave to go home, and would grab me back as I tried to leave the apartment, block the door etc. Sometimes I would be very tired and need to go to class in the morning and he would wake me up ever half hour to yell. This was all really hard to deal with and I was constantly worried about making him angry. The rest of the time he was a great guy, just he had some horrible temper and trust issues.

There would be a slight warning before my ex got full on mad, and so I would immediately start apologizing, saying everything was my fault (regardless of whether I thought I actually did anything wrong) in hopes of not making him angry. I would completely shut down and try to do whatever would make me the least happy so that he wouldn't start freaking out at me. 

Now my problem is that I can't stop doing this with my current boyfriend. He has never, in a year of living with me, yelled at me. He is just the sweetest guy and is so good to me. And yet any time I detect slight annoyance or that he is a bit irritated with me or something I did (and a lot of the time I totally misread it!) I start shutting down. I overreact extremely! 

For instance if he mentions that I forgot to take the garbage out like I said I would, and starts to bring the garbage bag out himself I catch myself telling him not to do it, apologizing profusely and grabbing it out of his hand to take it out myself. Then I will act around him like I am walking on eggshells for the next few hours. This is all completely ridiculous, and it really bothers him that I am always acting like he is close to hitting me or something when he is nothing more than a bit annoyed. It more bothers him that he can tell I am worried about making him angry.

Please, any advice on how to deal with this would be amazing. I love my boyfriend more each day and really don't want a silly hangup like this to hurt our relationship. I just want to stop...

I'll try to be very precise. Also know that English is not my primary language, tell me if something is not clear.

My GF of 8 years (I'll call her GF from now on) left me 2 weeks ago. With her, everything was good. I had self-confidence, self-esteem. I didn't particularly like the way I looked, but I was fine with it. Now, she left, and everything is going to hell.

I've always been bullied at school, (I was the school's fatty) which didn't help with confidence. In college, I got my shit together and I could pretty much function normally in society, even though I was still a little socially-awkward-penguinish. I had some girlfriends between 18yo and 24yo. As soon as I lost them (sometimes they would leave me, sometimes I would leave them), I had this urge to find someone else, another crush, as soon as possible.

I didn't like that, I was miserable. I was totally in love with love. Didn't care really if I liked the girl, I'd take anyone available. And if the girl didn't reject me the first time we'd talk, I was all over her. Now that I think of it, it's scary. Oh, and it was totally impossible for me to declare my love to someone I wasn't sure was interested in me. It's was my worst nightmare.

When I met my GF in 2005, things started to get better with self-confidence. Later, we became the couple everyone talks about because they've been together for so long. But I had anxiety problems that caused me a lot of stress, and I went to see a psychiatrist. We discovered I was probably suffering of codependency (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency) which, basically, is when someone's happiness depends only on the happiness of someone else. I was happy as long as she was happy. When she wasn't, I wasn't. Just discovering that this problem had a name fixed the problem automatically, and I no longer needed the psychiatrist.

7 months before now, I started working out. My weight was 345 pounds. Today, i'm at 292 pounds. I'm very proud of that, and I felt like the king of the world. Until she left. She left, telling me there was no love anymore from her side, and especially no sexual desire. 

And since she left, I don't have many friends to talk to. I have some, and I'm not willing to share any of this with them, I don't know why. The only person who knows my entire story is a friend I found on a weight-loss social media. This person lives 15 hours of car from my place, but is the best ear ever. J, you know who you are, and I thank you. 

So now I'm alone. It's been only 2 weeks. The first week went well. But since a few days, I'm starting to see some patterns in my life that thought had disappeared. I'm discovering that almost every girl around me is attractive, which is possibly quite normal, since I'm a very faithful guy, I wouldn't look at other girls really. And this morning, I sent an email to my friend J, saying ""Is it just me being single, or is my workout coach immensely beautiful?"" followed by a link where you could see my coach. 2 seconds after hitting ""send"", I thought ""...... here we go again"".

This week, I had a supper with a very libertine friend of mine, and we got drunk. I kinda wished she would have kissed me, slept with me, or do anything with me. Did not happen, and I'm kinda glad. In my head, it was crazy, I was just starting to deal with a breakup. But in my heart, in my veins, in my muscles, all I wanted was some attention from her. It scares me. 

Also, self-esteem is dropping. I lost 53 pounds, and I still don't think I'm attractive or better looking. I'm proud, but not satisfied. Once, once only since the breakup, I was in the bathroom, washing my hands. I stared at myself in the mirror, smiled at myself, and for a very short second, I thought ""Hey I think I'm handsome"". But the next morning, I'd look at myself in the same mirror, and I'd just think ""I hate you so much"".

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I have. I lost the person that was the anchor for my sanity and self-esteem, and I can't deal with myself. What is my problem? I'm thinking emotional dependence, but I'm not violent, I didn't beg my GF to stay with me. I didn't want a girl to stay with me just to avoid hurting me. 

When I'm at work and with friends, I smile, everything is fun. When I get home, I hate myself, I hate the fact that I'm alone. And I'm scared I'm going back to where I was 8 years ago. I'm just not happy by myself. 

Any advices? I don't know what to do, who to ask, what to believe.

**TL;DR** : Lost my GF of 8 years, went from super confident guy to self-hating guy even though I lost 53 pounds.

HELP! 

I've been in numerous relationships, some good, some bad, some great, but at heart they all had one thing in common - I never trusted my SO completely.  

I've always gone through text messages, phone logs, facebook chats, and emails, looking for proof that they were lying to me, even if I had no logical reason to think they were.  

It's like a compulsion; logically I know I'm being an idiot, but I get this feeling of dread that washes over me, and I can't calm down until I've looked through their stuff.  

Here's an example: my current partner and I have been together for a year and we work together. I love her and think she is amazing.  We were at a corporate event a few weeks ago (we work for a company with regional branches) and a guy from another branch hit on her, and asked her out to coffee.  She said something along the lines of ""Hate to burst your bubble, but I'm not single.""  

Now, a few weeks later they're facebook friends and I see that she liked something he posted.  And she's going out of town to visit some friends from college in a town that is as far away as the town he lives in, except in the other direction.  Obviously she's telling me the truth and visiting her girlfriends, but my instincts are telling me she's lying and visiting this other guy.  

Now, she's never cheated on me, or cheated on anyone she's ever been with, and I have no reason to *not* trust her.  I just have this literally ill feeling in my stomach until I verify that she isn't making my worst fears come true.  

Finally, this isn't a one time deal; it's happened with every person I've dated, where I get these paranoid worst-case-scenarios stuck in my head, and can't dispel them until I've violated the shit out of my SO's privacy, which makes me feel like a creeptastic, awful person.

So, my question for you all is: how does this not happen to everyone?  How do you guys put aside your paranoia, and just trust your loved ones?

I have this fear that love won't be as vibrant as it might have been if I were 19 or 21. Or maybe I'm stuck in a weird ephebophile stage. Will I outgrow it?

I've never been in a relationship. I always become depressed when I read about how girls don't like nice guys, or how if I expect something for being nice then I am not really a nice person, or stumbling upon one of those dating shows where all the guys look the same and are just playing the game - the entire dating process depresses me because it is not as simple as the elementary school ""date"" I had which I share at the end.. it doesn't seem like people no longer connect as fast. 

I feel so old. I feel like I no longer care about love - they are just youthful fantasies. Girls no longer smile at me. I regret never smiling back, going up to them, and talking to them (I was so terrified).

I have not accomplished anything in my life. I still live with my parents and go to a community college - severe social anxiety hurts. I'm slowly getting there, but the fact is I will always be 4-5 years behind my age group (e.g. I started driving on my own at age 23).

And there are other factors preventing me from finding someone to love, like my parents. I'd feel like a dirty, hormonal, mutt-experiment, horny-offspring if I showed interest in the opposite sex in front of them. And this odd fear has bled out into public. I fear showing any hints that I am interested in the opposite sex in front of strangers, like my professors, classmates, and any bystander.

I had a dream last night of finding someone and feeling lucky and happy about it (it was the first dream in years I've had).. before the dream, before going to bed, I had watched this one video on YouTube that made me cry.. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhsbravvKUk#t=1m14s

The girl at 1:15 is very much my type... I wish she'd cover us both with that piece of clothing, I'd love to stare into her eyes all day, play with her black hair, hear her speak Spanish to me... I could admire her all day.. that alone would make me happy - no sex involved... I'd treat her like a queen (I have no chauvinistic fantasies). Are these fantasies superficial since they involve no social interaction? I would have no problem opening up to her and being open about everything.. but how would that play out? I have no social skills :(

I guess the video reminded me of my childhood: going to Catholic school, all the pretty ethnic Mexican girls I had crushes on, my Mexican grandparents who have died, how too Americanized I've become (it feels like I'm living a lie even though I'm a 2nd generation American citizen), how I slowly forgot to speak Spanish even though it was my first language, that time when I was 21 and I was getting so many looks from all the young 19-20 year-old ethnic Mexican girls who worked at this restaurant me and my family stopped to eat at in El Paso, Texas (we were driving from Southern California - were we live - to my uncle's house in Belton, Texas, to spend the Christmas with them)....... I don't know... I feel like I can't flourish in this environment (Southern California)... so many people... pretty much everyone has adapted into that kimkardashian/kanyewest/americanidol/KROQ culture.. maybe I'd flourish if I lived in some colonial town in Mexico or in the past on some grape farm in Northern California (like in the movie A Walk in the Clouds)... I mentioned how I once visited my uncle in Texas..well our family spent 2 weeks there, and I noticed my health improve dramatically - my skin became shiny, I actually wanted to go out, people seemed more genuine.. I feel like a trapped adventurer who was forced to learn how to become a hermit... I want to have a Lawrence of Arabia adventure... idk what I'm rambling on about :\ just wanted to get it all down while I was crying

I think I blame the 4th grade teacher who called me to write my name on the board during class while I was mutual flirting with a girl in my table group (we were both smiling and looking each other in the eyes.. she had her head down on the desk and was starring me in the eyes while smiling, she let me play with hair clip as I tried to scare her with it pretending it was a dinosaur). I never caused any trouble as a kid, so something like that I took to heart. Maybe from then on I thought showing interest in girls was a bad thing. It was my first time and last time flirting with a girl, too.

Scared to get into a relationship for the sake of repeating the last one.  My last relationship was of three years and it went sour after awhile.  We started talking less and less and there was a lot of tension.  The sporadic fights started turning into regular fights (especially over little things).  I blame my actions were the catalyst for things going bad.

I've had problems with lying to her.  I would lie to cover up one of my fuck ups or lie so she wouldn't overreact (""Is this ugly?"", ""No, you look great"" kinda things).  If she was mad at me or I wanted sex (I like sex), I would try do something nice to make her happy, but I started to do less of those things out of the blue.  Every Friday night, I would go have band practice and come home late.  She wouldn't mind if she had a party to go to or hangout with her friends.  But she had no plans, she would get mad at me and wanted me to stop going.  We talked about getting married and having kids and things seemed pretty optimistic.  We both saw living with each other for the rest of our lives.  But I feel like I built it up to a ""too good to be true"" kinda thing.  I started to disbelieve it and second guessing everything.

After the second year, I started to making little mental notes of things I didn't like about her and it kept going and going.  Little things like watching her eat or hearing her tell stories would make me mad.  But sometimes I would completely ignore the things I hate and fall madly in love with her the next day.  It had to make her confused as shit, I know.  I realized how fucked up I was, but I couldn't shake off all the mean thoughts.

Eventually, I thought the best thing for me to do was leave, I packed all my stuff before she got off work and sat her down to talk.  She cried and cried and hugged me not to go, and I told her I need time to get my shit straight.  I can't stand seeing her cry because it would make me so sad, I felt like I couldn't leave.  I felt so insensitive at the time because I stopped hugging her, told her I'm leaving very coldly and left.

The month after we tried working it out, but I felt the exact same.  Very attracted/disgusted by her.  I think there something very wrong with this, but I don't know how to pin point it.  I've told close friends about it and one that was going to school for psychology said I sound like I'm borderline or bipolar.  I looked up different behavioral disorders and I can see some similarities, but I don't believe in self diagnosis.

I wrote it as honest as I could and if I could solve my problems without the internet I would. Trust me.

I am 21 years old and never was in a relationship. Whenever I meet a girl and I genuinely like I get her number most of the time and often get a date or two. Sometimes we even kiss, but after that she always seems to lose interest, found another guy or gets back together with her ex-boyfriend. Most of the time I even feel like we made a real connection, but she does not seem to feel the same. Because of this I often have confidence issues and I think they are part of the reason why girls don’t feel attracted to me when they get to know me better.

Originally my confidence issues come from childhood. Until I was 18 my parents basically told me all the time how disappointed they are in me and that I do everything always wrong, whenever I did something that they didn’t like (didn’t take out the trash, bad mark at school). We also moved to another city when I was 6 and other kids constantly made fun of my face, but still I had to go to exactly those out-of-school activities so that I “learn how to deal with them”. When I started university I got some new friends and let old friends go that I felt pulled me down, emotionally and also career wise. When I was 19 I had for the first time in my life something that you could call self-esteem.

Today this mostly reflects in the fact that I am uncomfortable with talking in large groups of people I don’t know well, when I go out with friends. I am extremely nervous when talking with people I think are better or more fun to be with than me, or really good looking girls or basically anybody with a huge ego that is accepted by the group.

When I think about, why I think that those people are “better” than me, I believe it is mainly because they are more socially accepted and funnier than me. My friends describe me as a very calm, intelligent and most of the time happy person (I asked them and told them they could be mean). That is mostly because I either don’t want to say anything (e.g. in discussion I don’t care about: which team will win a soccer cup) or sometimes I just don’t find the right words. Most people would probably also describe me as a very nice person. I often help people with stuff, when I know more than they do, even if I don’t know them that well. This may also be an issue with girls: I may ask too much about their preferences. But I generally don’t treat them too different from good friends, generally a bit less joking around as I kinda developed a feeling for how to joke around with my best friends.

I personally think I am a great person but I fucking hate myself for being so bad with girls. This one thing bothers me so much. I am an martial arts instructor, pretty sure that I’m not bad looking or at least I am one of the fittest persons I know, I do extremely well at university, I have a lot of good friends, but it bothers me so fucking much that I can’t get a girlfriend. I cannot even tell you with words.
(Part of the above paragraph might seem a bit narcissistic, but I put a huge amount of time in university and sport and this is the way I think most people would see these things

How do I overcome these confidence issues? What could it be that girls don’t feel attracted to me?

",subjunctivite,5,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/172hfo/30m_i_felt_too_strongly_for_someone_i_shouldnt/,"When I came back from my trip this summer, I felt terrible. Going on vacation is supposed to make you feel better, but I knew I was just coming back to a prison of my own making. I had gone for a week with friends, and then for the first time to explore SF. I posted a thread long ago asking for advice on what to see, and now I finally went and did it. It was terrifying, but everything went according to plan. However I had meant to meet up with friends one night and they never got in touch with me. So I spent that whole evening feeling miserable and not being able to find anyplace to go. I contemplated killing myself as I always do in such situations, but I had to catch the plane back home. I spent most of the flight just reading City of Dreadful Night over and over.

Two weeks later, there was an outdoor concert. I showed up feeling miserable, feeling like everyone hates me. I knew a lot of people who were there, but couldn't bring myself to talk to them. I felt like they were all having fun with each other and that there was no place for me. I stood there, feeling cold and tired and miserable. And then she showed up.

I had known her in high school, where she broke the heart of a friend of mine. We had talked online a few times. She always told me to get out more. She was notorious for being somewhat mentally unbalanced. At one point she said she was feeding Alka-Seltzer to pigeons just to watch them die. She wasn't stereotypically hot. Kind of looked like a penguin. A penguin with giant black eyes that had an effect on me like nothing else.

When I moved back home after college, I had started going on OkCupid dates. I was desperately lonely. I had had a sort of breakdown in college. I was standing on a chair in my kitchen with the laptop on top of my fridge trying to catch a neighbor's wi-fi signal, just so I could go on OkCupid. I didn't like anyone I met. They were all dead, somehow. Maybe I needed to bring out the life in them, or maybe I was looking for something that I really needed to find in myself. Of course no actually attractive girl has ever met me from OkCupid. If they even replied, they would always cancel dates a day before, or not show up, or show up and act really hostile the whole time. In the midst of this, I contacted her on a whim and asked if she wanted to meet up. She agreed. We hung out at a bar. It was like those scenes in a movie where the black and white picture turns color. It was all finally right. That was the first night I had felt OK in over a year. Then we hung out again next week in her studio. She told me more messed up stories like how she would get drunk and piss on the floor of the guy she was sleeping with. I wasn't sure if I was attracted to her, but I wanted to be with her. I sent her another message after that, but she didn't reply and I took that as a rejection.

She became addicted to drugs and then went to rehab, then moved to a different city as part of her treatment. I sent her messages every so often, and she would reply courteously. She moved back to my city about a year before the concert, and I saw her once, briefly, to show her around my workshop. Then in the winter we went to a museum together. Again, those eyes. We talked for a long time. I didn't know how she felt about me. I sent her some photos I had made, and a few weeks later she texted me that they were beautiful.

And so when I ran into her at the concert, I knew that nothing good could come of this. But we talked and being with her, I felt ok. Not lonely. She made me feel some kind of hope. One sunday I suggested we hang out. We did it again the next week. She told me at the end, ""We should do a sunday."" And so we started doing it regularly. She complained about her mother, and I empathized. My mother has tortured me most of my life and few people understand. She liked making things, and wanted to get back to it. I did too, and I've been increasing my skills in that area. I entertained the thought that we could be partners, we could help each other grow and achieve our goals and become better people. But every week we hung out, she had some new crisis and she never listened to my advice. Every week, I was sure she would stop seeing me. Every week, I felt like it would be the last time.

One week, I kissed her. I wasn't sure if it was the right thing. She was talking about dying, as we were saying goodbye, and going back into her cold, unheated house, and I wanted her to feel like someone cared about her. She kissed me back then said goodnight. I was terrified that would be the end. But it wasn't. When I saw her again, and asked if I could kiss her at the end. She said, No. You're interesting, but I'm not attracted to you. I said I wasn't that attracted to her either, but I enjoyed kissing her.

After that, we kept hanging out. We actually became somewhat closer. One night, she took my hand, but later she seemed reluctant to let me touch it again. Another night when she was upset, she hugged me for close to a minute. We hung out three weekends ago. I told her about how my best friend just got laid off, and I was worried about him (I'm also worried that he'll stop being my friend now that we don't see each other every day). She talked about her dreams for the future and I guess I slipped up by saying something about what I'd be doing there. Not sure if that had anything to do with what followed. In the end, she said she had a great time.

Two fridays ago, I texted her to come out and she replied that she was sick. I told her to get well soon. On Tuesday, I asked how she was and got no response. Yesterday, I tried again, but still nothing.

Part of me genuinely wonders if she's ok. Her facebook page hasn't changed since we last talked (I've been checking it often), and she has some health problems. I've thought about messaging her roommates to see if she's ok but so far I haven't done it.

I know what the reality is. She's had her fill of me, like I expected she would. She saw I was getting too attached, and decided to back away. And I knew this would happen, but I had nothing else. She's the only girl I've felt close to since high school. The only one I actually enjoy being with. The only interesting girl who is actually willing to spend time with me. And of course that means I'm nothing to her.

Now I am on my own again. Back to trying to get drunk enough to maybe hit on girls at a bar (harder and harder these days). Trying to somehow overcome my despair and focus on doing something with my life. But in the end I always fall back down again, I can't ever seem to focus on anything because I'm always feeling this overwhelming loneliness and the more I focus on solitary activities (which are my actual interests) the more I feel like I'm missing out on companionship. I know in the end, I'll probably be one of those drunks on the street whose ratty black coats seemingly blend in to the graffiti and the grey sidewalks. In some ways I've gotten better. In some ways the time I spent with her was better than anything I expected for myself. I never thought a girl I liked would be willing to spend this much time with me. I've done a lot of things this year I never saw myself doing. I feel myself spiraling both up and down and I don't know which spiral will win. I don't know what to do.

EDIT: There is one more general thing I should mention. I have for a long time had these feelings and I have a hard time understanding them. I tend to get emotionally attached to girls I'm not really attracted to physically. And I tend to have no emotional interest at all in girls I'm attracted to. This makes it difficult to have any kind of relationship with either group. I guess in part this may be because attractive people tend to have personalities that are not conducive to emotional or intellectual connections in general. I don't know. Someone help me figure it out. For a long time I thought this would become clearer if I could just have sex with enough girls, but nobody's willing to have sex with me. And, generally, none of this has become any clearer with age.

EDIT 1/25: Messaged her roommate two days ago, just a low-key ""checking to see if she's ok"" thing. No response. I'm guessing she probably said something to him to make him think I'm a bad person - otherwise why wouldn't he reply? Anyway I guess it's clear now that she's ok, just not talking to me. I want this to destroy me, much more so than it probably will. But right now it's still all that I can think about.

EDIT 2/4: Finally got a reply on 1/29: ""Hey, I'm not dead. insanely tired and busy."" I haven't replied. I guess I'm just supposed to let this go. Forget we ever spent time together. Don't ask questions. I don't like this world.

EDIT 2/26: So she called me on Friday and asked if I wanted to go to an event. I agreed. We went. She never made any acknowledgment that she hadn't talked to me for two months. Told me about this valentine's day present she made for a guy, who didn't appreciate it enough. I asked her who he was but she wouldn't tell me. Asked her what possessed her to do this for him and she said that she just wanted to do it. I feel kind of used now. I think she was feeling rejected and that's why she wanted to hang out.

Original post [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/16qhp8/he_m25_came_back_after_some_months_after_the/)

Anyway we spoke a few times and after a very mind fuck conversation online about the girl he was having sex with he decides to come over at 2am (100% sober)

We talk. Inicially the story was the same. ""I'm confused, I don't know what to do. I love you, but I'm involved with my other ex, even thought about getting back to her, I don't want to lose contact with you, I don't really love her, bla bla bla bla bla bla"". I thank god at least he didn't have sex with her again after being with me...

After a while, we were about to make peace and I was feeling better and... she calls him. He doesn't answer. I get mad. I get REALLY mad. He was in pain for seeing how much it hurt me, but the thought that she was calling him at 4am made me understand how much he was actually involved with her. He knows I don't want to be the second girl. I don't even want to be the first. I WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE. It's not a neediness, it's a principle. Period.

Anyway he defends himself for a while, bringing up shit I did with my male friends while we were in the relationship. I scream at him that it had nothing to do with what was happening and that it was the PAST and this was NOW. (Besides, no: I never did anything as bad as that to anyone).

Well he got out of the car to take a piss and when he comes back I was crying. I didn't hear him coming... He hugs me and tells me it's over: He's going to fix his life. He say he can't be with either me other the other girl, that he has to fix himself. I know that and I'm happy for him. He still said he loved me, but didn't want me to be attached not only because I would hurt, since he has no idea how long will it take, but also because it gives him ""pressure"".

Of course, bottom line, the idea was that... if he does fix his life he would like to get back to me... MAYBE... So he doesn't want me to be a prisioneer to him but he does JUST THAT. Brilliant.

I have no idea what to do. I love him, I do. I'm affraid to stop loving him. I don't want to. I want to love him... I want to wait... I do... But what happens? He is not lying, in fact, it is a bit obvious that he isn't, but he still could be... In any case, what happens if he DOES fix himself? Who will he be? Will he want to be with me? The unknown hurts. That's why he said what he said and I can understand it hurts him too, but... I don't know...

Guys... I just don't know what I'm doing anymore. What I should do... I know I may not follow the right advice from anyone and I might do exactly what I feel like doing and that may well be the wrong thing to do... But still... I need help, understanding and advice. I know I'm a lost case almost and this story is getting to a point it's ridiculous, but... I DONT KNOW WHY I DON'T WANT TO STOP LOVING HIM! I feel there is still a lot more to this story to be lived. I can't let go.

How wrong and lost am I?

So now that I'm actually trying to make a post, anything that was on my mind has fled the coop.  so this is probably going to make zero sense and be poorly edited as it's a stream of thoughts. 

As far as I can tell, so far the list of issues I have consists of thus [I'm 22M]: 

* I have zero self confidence, and always convince myself that any things I want are unimportant, or unnecessary.  This was routinely cemented several times during my high school years, when I was informed that personal satisfaction is unimportant as long as there are any financial obligations.  I also have almost no idea what actually makes me happy, as it's never really been able to be a priority.  Most people probably aren't particularly happy, so why should I worry about it?

* I simultaneously want to actually make friends and even get close enough to date someone, but also fear it or end up believing that it's not feasible.  It doesn't help that I live in an extremely small town and have to commute over an hour just to get to work.  I don't really have any local friends, and don't really have anything to offer anyone.  At least, last time I checked, most people don't want much to do with someone who spends just over 50 hours a week working and commuting, with hobbies that are almost exclusively solitary. 

* Related to the second, but when I DO actually meet people that I get along with, I always feel that they are likely patronizing me.  Or at the least, that they clearly haven't gotten to know me well enough to figure out that I'm not really worth the effort.  And when I get compliments, I usually just assume that the person is joking. 

* I work long hours at a desk job (10 hour shifts in a help desk, with a several hour round trip commute), and thanks to some awesome qualifications, am not qualified to work in any other area. As a result I'm heavily burned out, hate working, but don't see any alternative besides just sucking it up for the next couple of years until I work into another job that'll likely be just as shitty. 

* Even if I deem something concrete to be the matter, aside from me being a bitch about what seems to me to be the average human adult experience, I also can't afford to do anything about it as I lack health insurance, and have issues actually putting my thoughts into spoken form, especially when on the spot. 

I might edit this as my thoughts continue to come up. But what do I do?  How can I even remotely try to stop being a fairly miserable ball of crazy?",,False,,t5_2s90u,1357629234.0,,,True,t3_1667ot,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1667ot/pretty_sure_im_a_ball_of_crazy_wall_of_text/,

I have no friends, no job, not an own apartment, I have no interests that a girl would apreciate (like sports), I am not attractive, I am not social, I am depressed, I never smile or laugh, I do not know how to make anyone happy, I live with my alcoholic parents. The only thing I do is study and play poker at home, maybe read sometimes.

It feels like my brain is programmed that I dont see any point finding a partner because im convinced that NO ONE would like to be with me. It hurts a lot to think that way. I hate that im so depressed over it, I feel stupid for being male and being such a pussy, its not really ""accepted"" for guys to be sad, thats a girl thing.

I [26 F] have been in a loving relationship for more than two years now which has helped me grow in countless ways. My partner [24 a-gendered/androgynous], who I live with, is easily the most attractive person I have ever dated, and they are smart, remarkably patient and generous, and do everything in their power to show their love and make me happy. However, things aren't perfect, in that they are an incredibly cerebral person with a very low sexual drive, and I am an intellectual but predominantly visceral person with the libido of an 18 year old boy and a deep-seated desire to feel like a sex kitten. This has been a reoccuring source of stress and tension in our relationship, and while they make a concentrated effort to be more affectionate and express themselves physically, I know it's predominantly to make me happy and not because it's in their true nature or what they need.

 I'm happy that we've been intimate more frequently lately (about once a week), but I have never and likely will never experience the satisfaction of producing an animalistic response in them, or getting them outside of their mind. This is especially frustrating when a major aspect of how I see my identity is as sexual napalm, and not much brings me more satisfaction than being able to make a person's knees quiver and hear them moan with desire. 

Then there is my partner's friend [24 M], their oldest friend and probably their best. At first, I think I developed a silly crush on them because I knew they were unattached and I could sense their loneliness, and the part of me with a need to feel desired in an overwhelming way could be satisfied with sparking their interest. I didn't want to be a shit disturber, and I understood the psychological motivation behind my feelings, so I just pushed these romantic thoughts towards the back of my mind and focused on being a loving and supportive partner. 

Let me elaborate, and apologies for the wall of text that is growing: when my partner and I had just started dating, I moved into an apartment that through simple fate was four blocks away from my partner's best friend. So one night, my partner sent me a text that their friend was non-functionally drunk at a bar in my neighborhood, and since at the time my partner lived over an hour away, they asked if I could rescue their friend and bring him safely home. 

Before that night, we had only spent time together as a trio, and I wasn't prepared for interacting with just him one on one. I had to trek to the bar in the middle of the night, for one thing, and finding him slumped over in a bathroom brought out all of these weird hormonal protective instincts, so I was wiping down his face with a wet paper towel and helping him get off the floor. He seemed too drunk to navigate the crowd by himself, so without thinking about it I grabbed his hand and pulled him through the throng and back into the cold night air. 

This is where things start to get really weird - at first I had grabbed him by the wrist and yanked him out of the bar like an impatient mother, and I was irritated at having to be up and active in the first place. But when we get outside, I notice him wobbling towards intersections, so I grab his hand to tug him back and then he clamps down on my hand, and for the entire walk back to his apartment we maintain contact, slowly interlocking our fingers. The entire time, we avoid eye contact and maintain conversation as if everything were normal. He reaches the apartment, hugs me goodbye, and then tucks his chin over my back and proceeds to talk to me, whispering in my ear I suppose, while hugging for about five solid minutes. 

Maybe he was just drunk, maybe I could have been anyone since he was alone and lonely, but it really fucked with my head and made our trio hangouts a bit awkward: sometimes the friend would pay more attention to me than his own friend, sitting next to me (instead of them), chatting excitedly about music and pop culture references we both enjoy but my partner could care less about, and sometimes even acting more like my partner than my actual partner - a moment comes to mind when we were all sitting outside and my skirt got snagged on the bench, and the friend immediately gets down on his knees and fixes it for me, before my partner even had a chance to help. 

Other times, he ignores me completely and focuses on my partner, bringing them little gifts or offering to share food with them (and not me) or texting my partner while we're out together and trying to get them to ditch me to spend time with him. 

The weirdness continued. The friend had my cell number because it was needed to buzz into my old apartment (the buzzer is hooked up my phone somehow, I pushed ""9"" and the gate would open), and he had previously come over to spend time with my partner and I together. But in the winter of 2011 he started texting me separately sometimes, sometimes in the evening or even later at night, and we started having impromptu hangouts since we lived so close together and enjoyed so many of the same things. We'd play rock band together, or go get dinner, and it was almost always one on one. We're both avid ents, and on a few instances he would roll joints and hold them up to my mouth instead of just passing them to me, but I don't know if he was trying to be helpful, if he was just stoned, or if there was an ulterior motive.

Honestly, I'm still not quite sure if he's interested in me, interested in my partner and therefore trying to break us up, interested in both of us and just seeing what could happen, or not interested in either of us and just really, really awkward and with a bad sense of common physical boundaries. 

We went almost two months barely talking or texting earlier this year, and it had seemed like whatever weirdness occurred had blown over. I had talked extensively with my two best friends about my deepening crush, and they both agreed vehemently that being friends with this guy was a bad idea, and that I needed to back off from the one on one contact. I agreed with them, and I also pushed for my partner to spend more time one on one with their friend without me, so that I wasn't a part of the equation.

After several months of smooth sailing and minimal interaction with this friend, in November of this year a concert came to Chicago that I knew he would enjoy. I invited him, my partner, and anyone else they'd want to come, but my partner wasn't interested in this particular show and the other friend who was going to come ultimately bailed. So the friend and I wound up going to the show just the two of us, and we joked around the whole time and danced a little bit, and when he ran into an old friend he introduced me by name but he didn't say ""my friend ___,"" or, the way he used to, ""my friend ____'s girlfriend."" 

The show was on a Tuesday in late November, and while we were there we made plans to hang out that Wednesday to watch my favorite show together, since I don't have cable and he does. This is when things start getting bananas in the sexual tension department, at least on my end (and I'm starting to be more convinced it's on his end as well). Because for every single Wednesday since then (so for 5 weeks now), we've spent all evening together, alone and in the dark. 

It's a ritual - he buzzes me into his apartment complex, by the time I get up the stairs he's already waiting at the door and yells ""wooOOoooo"" with his hands in the air in excitement, we hug at the door and I beeline for a chair and sit down. He sits in the chair next to mine, we smoke a bowl, and then he turns out the lights for the tv show. He fidgets in his seat, cracks his knuckles, straightens his sleeves and tugs his socks up. He alternates between pointing his whole body towards me, foot on my side of the table, rubbing up and down as if we're playing footsie, and curling into a ball on the opposite side of his chair, cocooned protectively in his scarf or blanket.

Each week it escalates. Before Christmas, he had a long scarf on (it's cold in his apartment), and as the show started he offers to share his scarf and held an end out to me. We sat for about an hour and a half together, about a foot apart, sharing a scarf in the dark. Even after the show ended, and he was looking up videos online to watch, he didn't turn the lights on. He hugged me goodbye three times.

He tells me I have energy like sunshine, and that he can't help but smile around me.

We don't see each other over Christmas vacation, and he doesn't text me at all, but he comes over on New Year's Day to hang out with my partner and I, and he sits next to me the entire time and makes flirty jokes (we were playing peggle at one point and I mention how I ""totally suck with the dragon character"", and he replies ""So you're saying you suck with the d?"" stuff like that).

Yesterday, we watched an entire movie together, and when he asked if I wanted the lights on or off I told him to decide - so of course they were off. During the movie we chatted excitedly, and every time the character who vaguely resembles me came on scene, he commented on how awesome she was and how she's the best. At one point, I swear he had his eyes locked on me and sighed dreamily as he said (about the character), ""she's woooonderful."" 

As we have our usual hug goodbye, his face burst into the biggest smile I've ever seen and he said ""thanks for coming over, it was great to see you!"" (he's never said that before) then, as he closed the door, ""sleep well."" 

Half an hour later, at 11 at night, he texts me ""I had so much fun, and I hope you sleep well!"" And now I can't stop thinking about him, and my intuition is saying ""c'mon now, it was late at night and he was thinking of you and couldn't resist saying something even though he's seen you two days in a row and you just left his place 20 mins ago... that's not normal friend bahavior. You don't text someone that late or say those sorts of things to people you feel for platonically... right???"" 

I'm sorry this is so massive, I'm sorry it's so complicated and I'm sorry I'm being weak and indulgent. I know this can't lead to anything good. To circle back to the start of this novella, I mentioned how my partner's libido is much lower, and they have repeatedly suggested the possibility of an open relationship so that I can feel physically satisfied. Once, when drunk, I even confessed that I want to make out with their friend sometimes, and they said they'd be fine with that... but it's too good to be true, right? This is a massive shitstorm waiting to happen, and I refuse to be the vagina that tears apart a ten year friendship. Because even if my partner doesn't care about physical intimacy, and as much as they insist they don't care if I'm the bestest of best buddies with their friend, I've been down a path like this before and I know jealousy would be unavoidable. I know that even now there are moments of weird tension - my partner and I will be chatting about their friend, and I'll mention a story or something that it turns out he never told my partner, so then I feel weird and bad for knowing something about my partner's best friend they didn't. Or there was one time the friend invited me over to try something they made during our Wednesday hangout and my partner commented ""of course he offers to share with you and not with me!"" in that sort-of-joking-but-also-sort-of-serious-and-hurt voice. 

It's just... bad. And I know I'm being awful and frankly I welcome your insults. Something needs to snap me out of this. I need to just stop talking to this guy, he needs to be off limits. But knowing you should do something and wanting to do it is another, and right now all I want is to keep pushing and prodding at this triangle until it explodes. Thoughts of pouncing on this kid have been consuming me, but that's limmerance for you. I know it isn't love. But in this second I just want to, y'know, run to him and shove my tongue down his throat. I want to feel those butterflies in my stomach from animal attraction, to tease him and kiss him and just damn the consequences. I think it is a remarkable testament to my remaining shreds of willpower that I have never tried to kiss him. 


**TL;DR: I have an uncontollable boner for my partner's friend, and while we haven't acted on it I'm pretty sure he feels something too. I'm conflicted between wanting to be a righteous person and keep everyone involved safe from emotional harm and wanting to just go for it with the friend and disregard the inevitable damage.** ",,False,,t5_2s90u,1357244822.0,,,True,t3_15wmpj,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/15wmpj/a_crush_on_my_partners_friend_is_becoming/,

tonight i got upset with my boyfriend because he didn't surprise me with NYE plans (i guess i wanted him to read my mind). the night just got way out of hand after i explained my dissatisfaction with that. i screamed at the top of my lungs twice, cried and sobbed for hours, and cut up my stomach. i haven't cut myself in a while. i didn't even think i cut myself so badly, but i recently looked in the mirror and kinda gasped.

my boyfriend doesn't know i cut myself yet. he'll have to find out, but i'm scared because i haven't done this since we've been together. it's not a topic he understands. but anyway, aside from worrying about how that will pan over...

yes, i had a kind of crazy night. could it be because my hormones are still off balance and now i'm starting birth control? or is this a start of a mental relapse? i have additional stress aside from the pregnancy thing this month. but still, looking at my stomach, yikes.

She had a messed up childhood. But when it came to being a mom herself, she did some horrible things too.

She has what i believe is NPD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, where she is always blaming others for her problems (for example- she couldn't keep a man around because we, her children, scared them off. said directly to our faces.), she has to be the center of attention, no matter if it's positive or negative, if it puts her in the limelight, she will try. All throughout me and my sister's childhoods, we knew that her behavior wasn't normal. We urged her to get help, but she insists that nothing is wrong with her.

She also had uncontrollable rages. I remember one time around the age of 7-8, my sister was tickling me when we were supposed to go to bed. Instead of separating us, she trashed the room. Wiped everything off the dressers, tore out the drawers, etc. One episode ended in my sister's room being destroyed. a TV, a cd player, and a lot more. This rage was caused by my sister talking on the phone when my mom was waiting for a call.

When we tried to get her to stop and realize she was being abusive, she said, ""it's not abuse, i know abuse. i don't hit you!""

The anger problems and mental instability aside, she also drives erratically, texts while driving, plucks her eyebrows while driving (we almost got into an accident, i had to grab the wheel.), and had been in  at least two car totaling accidents, both caused by drinking and driving. And she has turned to violence (brawls) against friends, family and boyfriends.

Our relationship is rocky at best since i've moved out. She hasn't had a stable job since, has mooched off my sister for the last few years, and has asked me for money on multiple occations. She knows not to ask now, as i've told my sister i will not be an enabler to her lifestyle. children shouldn't have to take care of their full-functioning adult parents.

I feel bad in saying that i don't want any child of mine to have a relationship with their grandmother, but i don't think i will ever fully trust her. She has stolen from my sister, has lied to people to benefit her, and doesn't seem to care if it doesn't help her in some way. It's pretty much come down to if i ever in the future even see her smoking around my child, i would cut off contact.

I am M(23) who just graduated college in the US in June and am now doing voluntary work in South Africa. The woman I was dating in college F(22) and I broke up when I left the States cause of the distance but have still been extremely close and we have made it clear how much we still love one another. She is an amazing women: intelligent, resourceful, outspoken, and an all around certified Bad Ass. 

The thing is we have had major issues with fights since the beginning of our relationship and she has consider abandoning all hope on this relationship many many times. Recently we made a major break through that lots of our fights come from semi-abusive behavior that I exhibit: one of which is not respecting her boundaries that she lays out. 

Yet despite all the trouble, we have still been talking and here is the issue I have a question on. When we get into fights we decided that she will ask for space and I MUST respect that space. The thing is when she does ask for space my immediate gut reaction is to pull evasive emergency maneuvers to try and rectify the situation: contacting her and telling her how profusely sorry I am. This is selfish behavior driven by my own emotions and inevitably violates the space she requested, hurting her and showing her I have little self-control when I panic. This happened last night and she is threw with me, and this time she is serious. Which makes me so mad at myself cause we do make such great partners in so many respects and I know we still love each other like crazy. And pretty much everything is this relationship would be fine if I could just learn how to control my own emotions and just simply listen to HER and respect HER space.

So my question is, does anyone else freak out when their partners ask for space because they are afraid to lose them. And ironically in their efforts to save the situation makes things worse cause in actuality their acting like selfish dicks. If so what tools do you use to remind yourself to not get caught up in selfish emotions as to respect the most important thing: her request/space. 

Note: I am seeking professional therapy. Just wanted some more thoughts on the matter.

He makes a lot of sexual jokes towards me, sometimes about the two of us. He asks me for relationship advice a lot and tells me about all his issues he has with his girl. He talks about how he wants more and he feels like he isn't treated fairly, but he still loves her. When we're together he does a lot of flirty things, like tickle me or poke me randomly. He also sits up on me bed all the time while we watch movies. I have grown to really like him. This is where I get confused because I am usually decent at reading guys, but I have no idea what's going on up there. Can you help me and lend me your two cents as to what's going on?

The other unhealthy relationship was a friends with benifits situation. I became to attached to her and ended up falling in love. Of course the feeling was not shared by her.


Now i am dating someone new. She is very independent (which i really like) and an introvert. As an extrovert who is very touchy feely her wanting to distance herself can be off putting at times. I think I'm falling in love again however, and my head keeps telling me to end the relationship so i don't get hurt again.


So my question is should i just end this relationship, or am i letting my fear of more emotional pain get in the way?

I asked her out because she was funny, smart, nice, and (mainly) because she seemed to like me and I didn't think I could do any better. I really like her, and she me, and most of the time we're very happy together, but she's a bit overweight, and, truth be told, somewhat homely.

 I'm somewhat of a more confident person now, and sometimes--often, to be perfectly honest--I regret ever asking her out, simply because I don't enjoy the sex all that much, I feel a little ashamed of her in front of my friends, and I sometimes just sort of want to sow my oats and maybe know what it's like to be with a really beautiful girl.

I don't know if this makes me a bad person or not (it probably does, to some extent) but since I do feel this way, what should I do? Give the relationship more time in the hopes that her intelligence and warmth of personality overcome my distaste? Break up with her now, before she gets in any deeper and it becomes even more painful for her? Will I regret throwing her away when I find that all the girls I think I can get become out of reach as soon as I'm single? 

I also don't know what would be best for her; she seems to like me a lot, but I certainly wouldn't want to be with someone who was only pretending to hold a deep affection for me, and the fact that I'm writing this post tells me that my affection's not all that deep.

Really, it's a risk-reward thing, where I could take the safe route and keep going with this or take a chance out in the wide world, but with an additional moral component that I (being, as you can probably tell by this point, something of an asshole, although I do try to improve myself) am having trouble with.

So about three months ago my last girlfriend broke up with me. After reading the ""Way of the Superior Man"" by David Deida and ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss, I believe I have discovered why her affections died for me. But this isn't really about most of those reasons, as the relationship is over and I cannot rectify what happened. However one negative personality trait that I believe I can apologize for is one that has affected other friendships and relationships with other people.

I've always been a pretty arrogant person. From what I've gathered from most people I've always seemed a little arrogant, especially when I was being stubborn during an argument. However, before and during the relationship my arrogance grew to astounding levels. I essentially became a narcissistic asshole. Looking back on the things I did and said I am truly disgusted by my behaviour.

I know that I am still an arrogant asshole, that you can't fix a personality trait like that in just three months. I am trying though, and I can see many flaws that were once hidden from me. One thing that has been really bugging me is how I acted to others. And what I wanted to know is, should I bring up the old situations to these people and apologize for my behaviour?

Here is an example. In March I believe, some friends of mine convinced me to throw a sandwich at this girl. She was a friend of mine, and a really nice person. So with that in mind I threw the sandwich and it hit her back. I'm not really sure what I thought she'd do, but her reaction wasn't positive in anyway. She glared daggers into me before walking away, and apparently she cried about it. Me being the fucking dick I was didn't apologize or acknowledge that anything bad had happened, I just fucking laughed.

Since then our friendship has essentially died, and until I started trying to change myself I didn't really care. But now I haven't been able to get that situation, and others, out of my head. I feel really bad about it and have been thinking that I should apologize for about a week now. So once again, do you think there's any point in apologizing? Or should I just take this as a learning experience and hope that I can become a nicer person before I kill any other relationships I have with people?

**tl;dr:** Recently I've been trying to become a better person and stop being such a narcissistic prick. There are a lot of things I've done in the past that I really regret doing.

Now I've been reading up on it and I'm not sure it directly deals with the issues I have. 

I'm in contact with a psychiatric hospital through a therapist and my diagnosis was based on a bunch of tests I did with their in-house psychologist. 
My issues are mainly with dealing with other people and I'm extremely anxious in doing so and I've had tons of bad experiences due to either over-compensating this anxiety or acting out of a willingness to fit in and be like other people. 
The thing is I feel like I'm left outside and I feel very much alone, although I have tons of ""friends"" who I have issues understanding and doing things with which in turn makes me isolate myself more. Additionally I'm unemployed and not doing any type of school and haven't been since I graduated and got my GED in 2011. I've since then haphazardly looked for work and never really gotten any response on my applications and I'm not even sure I want to work. 

The thought of having to pick an education to later get a job is weighing heavy on me. It seems so odd to me that we have to work so hard to be able to do something and then spend so much time doing something unappealing for the rest of the better part of our lives. It all seems so intangible to me and I feel like I don't belong in this reality, and yet I've always had ambitions to become a scientist - and I love science! I'm just not sure I love the work required to do science. 
I also know that much of it is communication, which scares me. 
I'm afraid of being misunderstood and I already feel misunderstood.

I also don't really enjoy stuff the way I used to. I used to love reading fantasy novels and playing rpg's and adventure games. 
While being depressed for the last 5 years this has stopped. I no longer really find enjoyment in anything. 
So now I don't do a lot. 
I just sit in my room all day and browse the internet and take driving lessons. Sometimes I'll start doing something, like watch an anime and then I just do this for days only taking a break when I'm asleep and I don't even really regret it, although I know it's counter-productive. 
I don't really care tbh. 

I also have trouble concentrating and remembering things, more than I think I used to. 

I've always been treated like some sort of genius by people around me and I just feel like a fraud and an idiot. I live with my mom who pushes me and I don't know how to convey what I feel is the issue with me living a normal life. There's always the possibility of taking her with me to the meetings I have at this psychiatric hospital, but I honestly don't like her getting involved in this, since I don't trust that she knows what's best for me better than I do. She's just a nuisance, which is a horrible thing to say, since she lets me stay in her house rent-free and works her ass off and she's expressed willingness to help. So has my father, but I don't want him to meddle in this either. The aftermath of their divorce and what has been my experience with them since, I don't trust them to help me or do anything other than stepping on each-other's toes. 

I only have half a year to find a semblance of motivation to get started at uni and I've failed this two times already and I don't trust that the guy I talk to a couple of times a month have enough time to help me. 
Other than that, I would like to know that I am financially secure or that I can at least perform a job if I need to.

Being juniors in High School, my first girlfriend and I never had sex and we were both fine with that. I was 16 and not in any real rush to lose my virginity. My second relationship was by a wide margin my most intense. This was the girl I believed I would one day marry. She and I had done everything but actual sex. This was because she wasn’t ready and I didn’t want to push her. When we broke up, I was devastated. To some extent I am still living with the aftershock, even 5 years later. My third girlfriend was pretty religious and often made it clear that she wanted to get married and have children one day and didn’t want to have sex before marriage. I was only 22 and marriage was the farthest thing from my mind.


I’m 24 now and still a virgin. I don’t mean to say that getting laid is all that I care about (although what 24 year old male doesn’t think about it a lot), in fact a meaningful relationship  with someone I might care deeply about is a very satisfying prospect to me. It’s more that my virginity makes me feel like a beta male, especially at this age. My three relationships all came about because I knew these girls already, either through class or other friends, so I don’t know the first thing about approaching women I don’t know. 


I have pretty low self-esteem (between my virginity and being a little overweight and probably a host of other issues), and my friends tell me they don’t know why. By all accounts I have a lot to offer (well, a little anyway). I’m in grad school for engineering and when I’m having a night with friends, half the time I’m the one making everybody laugh. I’m a completely different person when I’m in the presence of people I don’t know, particularly women. 


The idea of approaching a woman fills me with dread. I imagine everyone is judging me, and I clam up and cannot think of the first thing at all to say. People say you shouldn’t think too much, that being in your own head will make you overly anxious and that you have to just go into it without thinking. Like practicing a golf swing - professional golfers don’t think “Okay I’m going to pick up the club and now I’m going to rotate my upper body while shifting the weight to the inside of my feet and then—”, they just take the swing. That’s all well and good, but if it was as simple as flipping a switch, I wouldn’t still have this problem. My biggest problem is that I simply do not know what to say to someone without sounding like I have an agenda.


**TL;DR:** 24 year old virgin with self-esteem issues, can’t get out of my own head when it comes to women and it’s crippling me. Does anyone have any ideas how to remedy this without feeling like I’m going to have a heart attack when approaching women? All comments are welcome. Thanks for reading.

First, some background on myself. I come from an Asian family and from my nearest recollection I have never been hugged or kissed by my parents. I was molested once as a kid by a tutor and it was my first intimate contact with a human being ever. I have never had a girlfriend and I am a virgin, my first kiss at 19 was forced upon me and I was what you would call a kind of unwilling participant. I used to play video games a lot at home, but in recent years I have discovered an athletic streak within me and I exercise and play sports daily now; I used to be ashamed of my body, but I can take off my clothes at will now. I was valedictorian at my high school, and was involved heavily with the yearbook.

I've been reading a lot on /r/seduction at first just to pickup girls and it quickly became a goal for me to do it for self improvement, to invest in myself. I am an interesting person, am attending university and am involved heavily with student clubs and hold what some would call ""important"" positions. I have a wide variety of friends and I get invited to a bunch of events very often, and I feel like my social life is quite fulfilled. I have what you call MAJOR social proof and I am the type of guy to say hello to everybody at an event and ask for their name, shake their hand with full on eye contact and make some small talk. I dress very fashionably and stylishly (A lot of people think so, and at this point in my life I am fully confident in the way I dress) and I have rarely met a person that I cannot make smile within minutes or even seconds of meeting me; I can become the center of attention effortlessly.

At this point in my life, everybody says I am a confident, chill, funny, outspoken and witty guy and people are always surprised when I tell them that I have a lot of anxiety and intimacy problems.

Just the other day, I was on an awesome date with probably the cutest girl I've ever met and when I dropped her off at her house, it became quickly apparent to me  that she had wanted to kiss me, but I just did not feel it. In fact, I had not even realized she wanted to kiss me until the day after upon some self reflection. Even after 2 more dates with her I did not make a move, and as I expected I was what you would call ""friendzoned"". (though I believe that only exists in one's mind, that is a different topic for another day)

That is when I thought back to my earliest days and I realized I've always had this problem with intimacy, physical or emotional otherwise. I do not have many close friends, but I am working on building a deeper relationship with a select few people.

It is odd, because being intimate, hugging or kissing or hand holding just does not come naturally to me. I am assuming it is because of my lack of experience in this field that I have this problem, but these problems may stem from earlier problems in childhood.

I feel like I can fix these weaknesses within me with time, but I need the internet's opinion on what I can do. I am quite content with life, but I am utterly missing out on the romantic side of it and I look forward to getting better everyday to become the absolute best person I can.

I guess the question is that is what I'm going through normal?

We spent all our time together, talked about marriage, thought about a life together, and were generally happy (I thought). But after a few years, she broke up with me.

I thought she was the love of my life and was devastated. Suddenly, my future was up in the air. The person I wanted to plan my life around was no longer there, and I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. My entire way of thinking/viewing relationships changed. I no longer believed there was only one person for everyone, which I guess is good, but I felt broken.

Not long after, I got into another serious relationship. We were together for 6 years, lived together, planned on marriage, had a dog together, etc. But after a while, I realized I wasn't happy and ended it. I had been the one to say ""I love you first,"" but in retrospect, I'm not sure if I ever really loved her or if I said it because I knew she loved me and didn't want her to tell me before I knew what my response would be.

Anyway, now I'm with another girl who I've liked for a long time, but I'm not sure if this ""like"" will ever turn to ""love."" Not because we aren't good together or I don't want us to be together, but because I'm not sure that I'm capable of such a feeling anymore. In fact, I think I hardly feel any feelings towards anything at all.

I (19, m) always dreamed of marrying the girl when I fell in love and had very serious feelings.
When i was younger I always thought it would be better to approach later because I thought then I would be cleverer, stronger, more experienced and somehow better, so I didn´t. 
When I was 18 I finally asked a girl out, but did it in a rather strange way because I didn´t wanted to manipulate her, because I thought it wouldn´t be right to do so and hence we never went out.

Till then I couldn´t imagine ever to have sex with a girl I don´t love.
Some months later I thought that I wanted to try it.
But when a girl at a party asked me to sleep with her without any excitement (she was drunk) I was shocked and didn´t sleep with her.

Then I realized that I want to stick to the dream of marrying and somehow want to be with a girl who is a virgin (I am one as well).
Maybe I subconciusly cared about her also beeing a virgin the whole time. 
Now I don´t feel any attraction to women who I suppose have had sex. 
I am 19 now and new at university and I guess there aren´t many, if any girls who didn´t have had sex.
So I don´t know how I could find a girl that fulfills my ideals.

If I would go for some random girl I thinck I would hurt her feelings and maybe never feel able to fall in love with a girl again.
Because I would always feel secondary despite that my feelings for girls always were very strong and sincere.
This issue is becoming really important to me and makes me depressed.

Another problem is that I don´t really have friends at uni yet.

I would be really glad if somone has some advice for me.

I really really do. I just have massive amounts of crazy and it's pulling me in thousands of pieces.

He's saved me from the clusterfuck freak show that was my previous life. I've always felt like he was too good to be true and that I was nowhere near good enough for him. However, this man loved me, supported me emotionally and encouraged me to do whatever made me happy (provided I still worked as he felt it unfair that he was the only one working, no matter how much money he made). I had some terrible jobs where I was harassed as well as seriously injured on the job but he would only say ""find a new one before you quit!"" Much easier said than done...

Anyway, I started feeling trapped. I started feeling like I wasn't good enough times a million--I couldn't get my shit together and I was afraid would lose my job and he would get pissed and then leave. Turns out I have massive anxiety/depression issues that have only been diagnosed in the past 2 years. I'd always avoided mental health doctors due to stigma fear. In my effort to please him I definitely lost myself. Here's where it gets sad:
I was abused physically, emotionally and sexually my entire life. My mother had me when she was a teenager and had no idea how to be a mother. She loved me, but had no idea how to provide a stable environment or quality people. She also has some sort of mental issues as she would only date/marry the worst scum on the planet. Her first husband (after my father) was on drugs and after she left him (but still would occasionally sleep with him and bring me to his place) he tried to break into our house to steal my half-brother (his son) or me, just to force her into getting back with him. It never worked, but I clearly remember sitting in the kitchen watching the flimsy backdoor get rammed and being so afraid that the hinges/lock/anything would snap and he would be there. He chased me down alleys in his van (the free naps &amp; candy van is more terrifying to me than most) trying to get me but fortunately there were always escapes like unlocked gates or holes in fences. We moved across the country to get away from him. 

Shortly afterward Mom started dating a man 13 years younger than her; he was 7 years older than me. It was mortifying because she would bring him to school events and kids would always think he was my brother and then look at me weird or say mean things about it. I hated him so much, and when he wanted to move to the bible belt and she agreed because the simple farm life was such a cute idea I hated him even more. As you may have guessed, the farm life was 4 people living in the cheapest possible shelter that could be called a rental house. There was no insulation on the back wall and the ""room"" my brother and I shared was coated with ice during the winter. During this time, he began beating the hell out of me. He knocked my head through a wall and gave me black eyes. I told my mom and she was in denial, just said ""stop blaming him, I know that happened in P.E."" so when they got drunk and he stumbled into my room while she slept and tried to rip my clothes off I knew I couldn't tell her. If she didn't believe physical evidence...why bother? He never actually raped me but came very close. A lot. The physical/emotional abuse from him, including breaking my cat's tail because I had trouble on a math test, never ended. Eventually they broke up and we moved back to the West Coast. 

Within months she dated another guy and he asked her to marry him after 4 months. I fought this tooth and nail but they bought a house and moved in together. Shortly afterward he decided I was more trouble than I was worth. I was 13 and he started giving me oxycontin and wine to make me sleep away the day and out of their hair. He also got fat and then she didn't like him, but couldn't just up and leave due to the house (this is her justification). He abused my brother until he agreed to call him Dad, and I stood firm on my ""NOPE"" and it got bad. He threw me out of the house in a towel and left me locked outside in the winter for hours. My mother fought with him, but never unlocked the door. He took close-up pictures of my acne when I wasn't paying attention and posted them all over the house so I could see what he ""was forced to see"" and I ""should suffer from the ugliness too."" Lots of stuff like that, but the final kicker was waking up to his hands around my throat. I knocked over a lamp and it startled him enough to let go so I could take in air and scream. Mom came in and he went to work. I decided then and there I had to leave (I was 17, just starting senior year). I asked my grandfather if I could move in with him but he said it was my mom's responsibility to take care of me. Had he known what happened, he might have said something else, but I was too scared to tell him. I was too scared and ashamed to tell anyone about any of the abuse I had endured over the years. If my own mother didn't care, why would anyone else? 

I ended up moving in with the only person who would take me: a friend who liked me but I wasn't attracted to. His parents moved my stuff into his room from the spare (I paid them rent) saying they knew we were fucking (we weren't, but then I felt like I had to) which brought me down to a whole new level of depression. I couldn't fight back against anything because I literally had nowhere to go. I developed Stockholm Syndrome (for lack of a better word) as the family used me as a maid and the boyfriend treated me like a whore. He beat me and locked me in closets and I was grateful when he would let me out and eat. The dad used me as marketing. Even though he would make fun of me, and my boyfriend told me I was ugly (he was a massive bully), they made me wear short skirts and stuff to attract the men over to sell fundraiser tickets to games. My entire life I was an object. It's all I knew--I had to look perfect or else I would get beaten. That's actually how it ended. He thought it was funny how I would flinch if he lightly slapped my face and kept doing it while I sat on his lap with my wrists pinned. I finally pulled one free and knocked his hand away, accidentally hitting his chin. I didn't even register the face punch that knocked me across the room onto a fireplace. I laid there with tears running down my cheeks coming back to myself just in time to hear his dad say ""you're playing too rough, son."" I moved back in with my mom (who had finally left the man who tried to kill her daughter). 

I lost myself in my job at a retail store and met my husband. I never told him anything about my past aside from ""I had a terrible childhood. I was abused and it was shitty. I don't want to talk about it."" 
Flash forward to present, 8 years from when we started dating. I recently had a nervous breakdown thanks to all these years of repression. My therapist helped me get through depression (suicidal thoughts/desires that were never acted on) and is pretty fantastic. I'm working on the anxiety as I always feel like someone will pop out of the wood work and beat the shit out of me. I never feel safe. I did feel loved until my husband confessed he wanted to swing. We were really young when we married and he's my absolute best friend. It destroyed me on the inside. I went along with it and sometimes I even enjoyed myself. We started because I wanted to experience a girl and it blossomed from there where he realized he has a cuckold fetish. I told him I didn't want to do it anymore and he got depressed, so I kept doing it because I would do anything to make him happy. I ended up getting chlamydia and a cancer causing strain of HPV despite using condoms. I resent him for this even though there's no way he could've known. 

Now that I'm more mentally sound, I'm making my own calls and he's getting frightened I'm going to leave. I'm scared that I'm either too dependent on him and limiting myself because the past 8 years he's saved me from a bleak and miserable existence, or maybe this is just the mental issues talking where I feel trapped. At his urging (and my therapist's) I've opened up to him more about my childhood so he can understand me better. The past few weeks I've told a few stories and while he feels like he knows me better, and the therapist says it's good in the long-term to let people in, the retelling is making me feel so sick. I hate opening up to him like this, especially when I feel like we might not work out. I want a family and he doesn't--and there's no way I would let a child into a life where it's not fully wanted by it's parents. I'm having nightmares again, panic attacks, and I don't feel close to him at all anymore. I lay on him and he holds me and I cry because I'm so unattached to everything. I want to make this work. I really do love and respect him, but I don't know how to make everything okay again without giving up what I want. And how do I know if I really want something? I've never had an opportunity to really develop myself--I've always had to hide it or in this case, go along with whatever he wanted due to fear of him leaving. I don't even know which direction is up. Can anyone offer any advice? If you've made it this far, you're a fantastic person and I thank you.

I'm in no rush to have sex, although I would definitely do it should it be offered.  I think I'm pretty smart, well adjusted in most aspects of life, decent looking and fit if not skinny.  Problem: I find myself 'falling' for the best looking girl who would give me attention and I'm worried about being clingy.

I (would like to think) have options but will generally 'fall' for the best looking girl who likes me.  Sometimes this feeling is reciprocated but I'm constantly worried about how clingy I seem to them.  Because of this, I'm doing a constant balancing act of pushing them away because I know if I didn't, I would probably come off as way too clingy.  It always seems like I'm more invested in these potential relationships/friendships than they are - which is probably true. I think part of this stems from an experience I had in high school.  I was infatuated with my best girl-friend who had attachment issues herself with her ex.  She also had self image issues so I guess she really liked the attention I gave her so she reciprocated.  However, she was so attached to her ex that I got 'friendzoned' pretty hard and was always a lower priority to her than her ex even though, for me, spending time with her was almost always my top priority.  This hurt me pretty badly, I think I'm over it now but it has definitely affected the way I see relationships and make decisions.  I realize that experience is not a good benchmark to use to judge/measure future relationships but I'm kind of at a loss as to how frequently I should contact someone i'm interested in (even during the pre-dating/dating stages).  

In addition to all this, I have some confidence issues.  My confidence level is almost always relative to the kinds of people around me.  For example, this summer I worked at a major investment bank and was a rockstar in my social interactions.  My reasoning in the back of my mind was something along the lines of  ""I dont give a fuck because if anyone hates on me, chances are, they're doing a lot less with their lives than I am and are probably exponentially less successful so I don't really care what they think"".  Fucked up?  Maybe.  But it applied to my interactions with guys and girls and made our interactions very pleasant (good times to be had by all).  Another example, in stats class, where my groups consisted of mostly awkward people, my confidence was also through the roof.  But as soon as I get placed in a group with that one frat bro who is more sociable than I am, knows more people and is almost equally as intelligent, all confidence goes out the window.  

I've tried 'fake it til you make it'.  It works to some extent - only in situations where I have enough material to contribute (ie conversations centered around stuff I'm interested in).  It's not really a problem with my conversational skills, I can hold a conversation with a stranger for quite awhile and feel comfortable about it.  It's just that sometimes my mind just has nothing to say about the current conversation topic and I feel there's pressure to talk about something memorable or funny when trying to connect (not impress) with girls.

I had a normal upbringing, very happy, awesome parents. Husband was the black sheep of his family and carries a LOT of resentment about it at his mom, stepdad, and half-sister (Golden Child.) As a result, he keeps his relationship with his mother cordial, but aloof (we live thousands of mils away), and chooses to have no relationship with his step dad.

I have always found them all to be cold and very shallow - they say nice words, but there is NO emotion behind them. They are WASPs, kinda racist, two-faced and judgmental thanks to church, and the mother may have BPD so she is pretty unstable. She's an empty nester now, and has NO life outside of church.

I always had a hard time adjusting to such volatile and uncaring people. Most of all, I FUCKING HATED how they treated husband. As a result, things were said over the years and MIL had a very strained relationship for years. SIL broke off contact with me several years back for it (she believes that I am a liar, and that her half-brother had a beautiful childhood and that I am simply slandering her family.) Husband isn't talking to SIL until she speaks to me and NONE of them have any communication skills worth a damn. They DO NOT talk about issues.

We could not have less in common. But, this should be a dream scenario, right? Husband doesn't want to have contact with them - we live far away - what's the issue?

The issue is me. For some reason, I find myself coming back for more and more punishment - I stalk MIL and SIL relentlessly on FB, I read the self-centered emails MIL sends every day where she only talks about herself and her perfect daughter (and her husband, the favorite in-law) - EVEN THOUGH I know it'll only make me jealous of SIL/BIL or..... angry that she couldn't give a shit about her brother or.... make me become a judgemental bitch that makes fun of them behind their back.

That's not who I am with everyone else in my life - but it's like they are poison. Husband learned long ago to stay away, but I create problems by constantly paying attention to what they're up to, because when MIL sends an email that says something that offends me - I get bent out of shape. Husband is not willing to do anything, and claims (maybe rightfully) that it's my own fucking fault for having contact with them.

But I can't seem to cut ties. Maybe because if I do - I'll be painted as the devil woman, since they have NO IDEA that he hates them all.

Maybe all I wanted was to have decent in-laws who were balanced human beings who treated husband well and gave a shit about me. I got none of that - how can I let go? How can I STOP THIS CYCLE?

I can will myself to not think about them for long stretches, I set up email filters to delete the emails, but... curiosity gets the better of me and I dig them up, or I get into periods where I really think about them all the time.

I get upset that MIL likes her daughter and her son in law better than us, that she visits them all the time - BUT - we would have to have her visit. I can't stand the woman and we couldn't have less in common.

(i am a highly sexual person anyway, but he just does something to my body.) I love him and I tell him. I try to do everything I can to be sure he is happy. Lately I feel he is less interested. I bring it up but he hates to talk about it and gets upset.

So here is what he told me:  I am too needy and it annoys him. Example: we went out with friends and both mingled. I saw him outside and touched him to let him know I was there. He took it as me wanting to take him away from his friends. Not the case. He ended up mad at me all night.

I want sex too much. Our sex is amazing. Everytime we make love he raves about it. But when I make a move or ask for it he gets turned off and tells me to relax.

I say I love you so much it has lost meaning he says.

He is out a lot or busy with school to the point I am very lonely in our relationship. When I told him this he says I sound bored and need a hobby.

I am at the point of shutting down. Just turning everything off and exist in this relationship and let him come to me if he wants me. We did couples therapy for awhile and he liked it then but now thinks it was silly. Im in therapy alone now.

1348919018.0,5,self.ihaveissues,10nwzd,Girlfriend left me after three years after I changed my life to accommodate hers.,FRizKo,7,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/10nwzd/girlfriend_left_me_after_three_years_after_i/,"We met in Sweden while she was having an summer internship at IKEA world HQ (she's American (22) I'm Swedish (25). 

I lived next door to where she was staying and we spent the entire summer together. That fall I went to visit her in the US. After that it got shaky as we didn't know how to continue our relationship. Skype was a big factor in our lives at this point. I had a current life situation where it was no problem for me with 6 hour time difference. 

Eventually she folded and hooked up with her ex. This was painful as I could see more and more pictures of her on facebook with this guy. Eventually she told me over skype about him and her hooking up. I so wish I left all this at this point.

A few weeks later her ex decided that he didn't really want her and dumped her. She came crying to me. And seeing how I also felt the stress of not knowing any future together I forgave her. 

Shortly after we came up with a plan to be together. She would apply to go to grad school her in Sweden. Grad School was at the time free here. And there are several programs that are purely international. Including one that she was passionate about. Environmental studies. 

She applied but didn't get in. We found out that this was because it was the last year that non EU students would study for free after the government had changed the laws and a record amount of applicants applied. 

Somehow we managed to keep going. We decided she would apply for a resident permit that you can get here in Sweden if you are in love with a swede. That worked and she went over to Sweden to visit me for a week. Next year she got in to the school. Keep in mind I did most of the work. 

We had a vacation in Italy together and shortly after she moved in with me in Sweden to start school. This was august. Everything went on and seeing as she didn't know any Swedish and she was swamped with school work. She never got to hang out with my friends in a meaningful way. (eventually politeness wears down and people start speaking their own language at party's and stuff). 

So I changed everything to accommodate her. To make her happy. 
I started alienating my friends and my family. Eventually she started making friends in Her class. Most of her classmate lived in another city so it was hard for her to attend any social events. It was an 1 hour commute. And when she started sleeping over at her new friends places I was happy about it because she got to have some social things happening to her that wasn't solely based on my sacrifice. 

January she tells me she has lost most of her feeling towards me. I got a real wake up call and start doing the social events at her school with her ( I even bought her a 800$ air ticket for this upcoming summer so me and her could go visit her family shes been missing). 

This being me working 9-11hour days then commuting to her Schools city to be completely exhausted at the end of every night. Eventually I arranged a Sauna party here in my town, I even arranged our apartment to hold over as many as 7 of her classmates to stay over if needed. Everyone invited showed up, but only one took the bait to sleep over. That was what I learned later the guy she spent most nights sleeping over with because he had a foldable couch. The morning after the sauna party everyone decided to take a trip to Copenhagen. I made my GF and this guy breakfast. I made blueberry pancakes. it took me some time since I hadn't tried doing that before. My GF and him left for a trip Copenhagen with the rest of her class, I was invited with but I had more work to do early next day and really needed some rest.

A few weeks go by when I think I started to make her feel more for me. A national holiday was coming up that is a big going out day. I asked time of from work to go with her. I got a denied and ended up working that day. When she got home the day after she tells right away that she slept with him that night. (the guy I made breakfast for)
Well things turned to shit here. It is now 5 months after and I'm still depressed. I started hanging out with my old friends again but it is really strained as how I alienated them before. I have no problems picking up new girls but it leaves me with feeling like someone who is full of shame.
The only just desert she ending up getting was the she lost her resident permit when she left me. She ending up having to pay 26K$ to finish her last school year. (not to mention that she now has to pay full rent and other costs that I covered for here since she was studying and I was working)

I'm not a hundred percent sure why I'm posting this. I just needed someone to read my story. Input would be nice. I'm feeling incredibly depressed about this and need to find a way to get over it all.

I know it's been a long time but I've finally figured out what my problem is and felt like it would be good to let at least somebody know. And this time I prefer to use my real account instead of some throwaway. I'd also like to thank the people who responded to my original post, especially tothecore, because in the end it was his advice that placed me on my path to finding the answer. I should say I haven't been to a doctor yet to get this verified, but even then I there's no doubt in my mind that this is it. Everything I've read, whether it's symptoms on medical websites, or people sharing their own experiences with this as well, ALL of it describes me, and my life right now to the most perfect T that can be drawn.

[Anhedonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia). The (almost) complete loss of joy or pleasure in doing anything life cause by what is believed to be a breakdown in your brain's reward system. The source of everything wrong in me. And truly one of the most evil things to exist on this planet. Any form of torture is the only other thing I can think of that's worse than this.

I say *almost* complete loss because I do feel some emotion. But only very very slightly. On a scale of 1 to 100, almost every emotion I'm capable of feeling has never gone past a 6 in 2 years. Everything worth enjoying never gets past a ""meh"" for me. Ever. Whether it's some physical activity, watching a movie or TV show, playing a video game, or worst of all, spending time with other people, it all ends with a feeling of 'Yeah that was kind of fun I guess, but I wouldn't feel any different if it hadn't happened.'

There are still a few select emotions I can feel with a little more intensity than that though.

Hopeless in anything and everyone is the only thing I've felt consistently this entire time. It never leaves. I may not notice it sometimes, but it's always there. Like your own shadow. The worst of it happens in the form of a very desperate sadness. Like the only thing left to do in the world is go be by myself in a room and just wait for everything to end. Not kill myself. I don't want to do that. Just either wait to die or for everything to end. There's a difference.

Frustration every time I try to 'fix' this in some way. I described it in my original post. I try to make myself *feel* this way or that way and in the end no matter what I do, I can never reach that 6 mark. And once I give up there's nothing but frustration, headaches every once in a while, and that very desperate sadness I mentioned earlier.

Jealousy and pure bitterness towards the people I'm spending time with and are somehow getting enjoyment out of what we're doing. They're having fun, and I'm not. I *can't*. And I don't understand it! How do they do it?! What are they doing that I'm not?! I don't get it! And I don't like it!!! So many times in the past couple of years I found my self just sitting by myself trying to figure out just how the fuck 'fun' even works. Like it's some *concept* that will always go above my level of understanding. You ever see that episode of Spongebob where Patrick got a brain that made him a genius, and at one point he's reading a textbook called ""The Physics of Fun""? Yeah. That's me.

And that's it. That's the extent of what I can really feel, and even then it's still not much. The most I feel is when I get that desperate sadness feeling, and that never goes maybe past 30. It'll stay there for about half an hour. Like I'm about at the point where I can cry, then it's starts to go back down again and within 5 minutes I'm back to 'meh' for the rest of the day.

Even though anhedonia is suppose to be the loss of enjoyment in life, the loss on enjoyment also means the loss of many other emotions that I now know exist only because enjoyment does. Anticipation and excitement, accomplishment and satisfaction, frisson or any sensation of any kind, desire, and motivation. Add all this up and you have someone who has no drive for literally anything at all. There is no drive to truly live. In the end there's not really even such a thing as 'living' either. You're not living. You're existing. And that's it. That's all there is.

But there is hope now. I found out what all this was 2 and a half weeks ago, and once I got done reading as much as I could about it, I *finally* felt hope and excitement for the first time in years! I got so damn excited, that I went out to the closest park to me and I ran for about 20 minutes. Just simply knowing not only what it is, but that other people are going through the exact same things that I'm going through, that I can't actually help any of it, and more importantly, that it can actually be *fixed* is just a huge relief to me. Like now there's something to look forward to and things really are going to get better. Fixing this is my number one priority in life right now. Nothing else matters. Because as long as this exists, there will be no life for me.

Sorry this took so long. This post and the original make me think I should look into being a writer. But there is a point to all of this. I want more people to know about this. I want to increase the awareness of this in anyway I can for plenty of reasons. Just simply knowing what this is has already helped in tremendous ways. And to think the entire time I was going through everything, all I needed was only a click, and 5 minutes worth of reading away. That's it. Can you imagine how differently things would've been if someone told me about this 7 months ago when I originally posted all this? I doubt I'd even have it anymore by this point!

And I'm not the only one. Look at the comments in my original post. About half of them are from people saying they're still going through the same thing. And they don't now what it is or why they're that way either. Right before I came here, I was at another website full of people suffering from this, and one man was talking about how he's only recently heard the word anhedonia, and that he now knows it's what he's been going through for the past *14 years!!*

14 years..... Just the 2 alone I've been through feel like a tragedy. Like it's the only way to take away someone's life without full blown murdering them. But 14? I can't even think of a word to describe how awful that truly is. And I don't even want to think of a word that could.

But that's my reason for doing this. The more people know about this the better. With it being so unheard of, people suffering from it are left with basically no choice but to walk around asking why. Never moving forward. Never going backward. Never even knowing were they actually are. So if you or someone you know is like this, do your research on it. There's plenty of info out there, and there's also plenty of treatment options. This may be a symptom of depression, but there have been plenty of cases where actual depression stops while the anhedonia itself doesn't. And usual medication treatment for depression has shown little to no effect on anhedonia either. So while they're very closely related, they're not entirely the same thing, and should be treated as such.

tl;dr **I have anhedonia, the inability to enjoy life. More people should know about it, and how it affects you. I feel the more people know about it, the better it can be for people suffering from it to accept it, and seek more necessary treatment for it.**

I have a rather strange story (maybe) and I guess I’m looking for kindred spirits to see how you cope. I’ve been all over Reddit and I don’t know where to post this so I figured ihaveissues would be a good start. Sorry if I messed up on accident. I don’t think this is a DAE post… 


**TL;DR: Fell in love at 14, have never found anyone else like her. Has anyone else had an irreplaceable relationship like that that *still* affects them? How do you cope? How does it make you feel? Please don’t let me be all alone in this.**


In 2000, back in the days of home 56k internet, I used to chat online in Yahoo (if anyone can remember that) I joined a community of other nerds who were similar to me. We used to roleplay shows and movies and other nonsensica. Generally we had a damn great time.  

Roleplaying in my case, for those who aren’t familiar, was essentially to adopt a personality and write stories with a bunch of strangers online- literally playing make believe. I never really adopted a persona, I just was myself, if that makes any sense. But I met this girl there who we can just call Mimi. Instantly there were sparks between us. 


Just: ZANG. Nothing got in the way- not looks, not location, not even time. I liked *her* and she liked *me.* It was purely personality based. I had no idea what she looked like. 


I loved the hell out of her right off the bat. But, somewhat irrationally, I couldn't tell if she was acting as someone else or if she actually felt that way herself.


Our relationship was chockfull of drama from the very get go however. There was madness in every direction- she was already taken, I swept her away, we fought, I cheated, broke up, we fought, made up, got back together, fought, kept in constant touch, she left me but still loved me so I told her new boyfriend, they broke up, we got back together, we fought, I cheated,  etc etc. But this was all online, virtual. It was a fucking mess but one hell of a journey. My life was like a soap opera. Between my online and real life, that year was the best year out of my 26: I’d never trade it in for anything.  


But, remember: Our relationship was completely online or over the phone. I have literally never met Mimi in my entire life. 


I did finally leave her though. She took me back one last time, but I had found someone else. I chose this girl who I don't even remember over Mimi. A few years’ worth of cooldown later, we tried the friendship thing. The both of us were going through some serious shit in our lives. I was hanging out with really horrible assholes in highschool who mostly tolerated me. I was praying college would be different, but I hung out with some theater Nazis, so... It was not different in the slightest. I literally had a mental breakdown because the only people I knew drove me up the fucking wall. I needed something normal, someone who cared. Mimi was extremely distant/preoccupied and I was extremely clingy. She moved on, for the most part, but I was trapped, stuck. I couldn’t grow. I was a fucking mess, I was obsessed.  Even to this day, I’m still so embarrassed. We had some more really bad tension and drama in college but ultimately she left me and disconnected. This was… 6 years ago. 


Occasionally, every 8 months to a year, Mimi pops in out of the blue and messages me on some ancient account, says hi, and then inexplicably vanishes for no reason. She’s as dysfunctional as I am. I tried getting in touch with her on Facebook last year and she was acting like a robot to me “Yes.” “No.” and she asked me to buy a 250$ something for her because hey, why not, right? Then she randomly invited me to this event I couldn’t possibly attend and then deleted me when I pressed the patented facebook decline button. If she hates me so much, why does she get curious check in? 


So I haven’t talked or heard from her since Thanksgiving-ish. Which is fine. I’m not stalking her life. 


But I’ve never forgotten her. I miss her a lot. 


It’s been 12 years since we met, and technically 6 since we really earnestly, irreparably split. I’ve dated etc, met people, went places, grew up and changed a lot, got more comfortable in my own skin, moved on etc. I mean, I’m 26 now and making like, 45 something a year. I’m not a cave dweller who smokes a ton of weed in his mom’s basement all alone and doesn’t do anything with his life. On the contrary, I'm out there *looking* for someone like her. But I’ve never met another girl like her. I’ve had some great, some terrible and several meh relationships in the meantime but the stars haven’t aligned into that perfect ‘sparks’ relationship since. Mimi was special because we bonded really deep despite never seeing each other, you know? I just loved *her.* Hell it was a solid 6 months before I even saw her (lovely) picture. Scanners weren’t the most common back then. Forget about digital cameras.


Have I been sabotaging myself? I don’t think so. I’d like to think I’m a pretty good boyfriend when push comes to shove. It’s not like I don’t try. They’re just not the same as my first. I mean, they’re good but… Chasing the dragon. If she ever came back to me and said 'bertbargo, I want to see you,' I know for a fact I'd drop whatever it was I was doing and answer the call with an affirmative. 


And then I see all these ex-gf/bf posts on Reddit and I can’t help but feel bad about myself. It’s like I’ve got some serious dysfunction because I still miss/feel for my first love even after one dozen fucking years. I’ve recently accepted the fact that I still really care about Mimi and nothing will come of it. I’m coping/living life. I just don’t want to feel so alone with the way I am, you know? 


Does anyone still really have strong feelings towards an ex that they just can’t shake? How do you cope? Do you feel guilty? Have you been friend zoned and dying a slow horrible death?

I'm a seventeen year old girl at a fairly high quality private high school.  I live a good life.  I have friends, I go out, I feel that I have purpose.  Overall, I really don't have anything to complain about.

I do have a somewhat dark past, I guess.  I was sexually abused as a kid by a family 'friend', and last year I had a really difficult patch in which I was close to killing myself.  It was a hard time, but I went on antidepressants and I've been generally feeling alright since.  I don't, however, think my childhood was the only cause to my feelings during that time.

I guess this is where I talk about why I'm really here.  Last year was my first class with a teacher that I'll refer to as Mr. I.  Mr. I teaches several grade levels of history at my school.  He's young (between 24-29 I'll say, to protect his identity), and he has taught for a short enough period of time that he still cares about his work.  He was my favorite teacher, which is ironic seeing as that the sciences are my strength and interest.  I ended up spending a considerable amount of time with him, in class and after school while waiting for a ride home from one of my parents.  I suppose you can see where this is going.

I developed some serious feelings for Mr. I.  I'm quite hesitant to say love, because I believe that love is a mutual feeling, but I also wouldn't call it a crush.  To be frank, he's not a Calvin Klein model. I didn't notice him in a romantic way at all when I first started in his class.  I just found him to be funny and a good teacher, so why not spend a little time doing homework in his classroom after school? I soon realized that he’s an extremely balanced and kind person, with both his students and those he is close to in his nonprofessional life.  I have a lot of respect for him. It was only a few months into the school year that I recognized that I had started to care about him in a way that I probably shouldn't.  

He was and is equally fond of me, although obviously not in a romantic way.  He has told me several times that I am one of his favorite students, that I am very smart, that I am a hard worker, etc.  We’re on a first name basis outside of school hours.  Despite the undertones I realize that this story is beginning to take on, I truly believe that he has no feelings for me beyond what he would have for any other student.  I’m not under any impression that this is going to result in a happily ever after.

In spite of having a pretty good grip on reality, I think that dealing with my feelings for Mr. I contributed to my depression last year.  It made me feel like shit about myself.  The one person I really cared about in my ridiculous hoity-toity school was the one who I really shouldn’t be involved with.  More than anything, I would NEVER want to incriminate him, especially considering he’s never been anything but professional.  I went back and forth between trying to be satisfied with just spending time with him and feeling awful for being unsuccessful at being satisfied with just spending time with him.  This combined with dealing with what I now know to be symptoms of PTSD from my childhood really did a number on my state of mind.

Thankfully, I got help, I started on medication, and I have been generally doing better.  It’s so twisted, but Mr. I was actually a huge support for me during that time.  A considerable amount of my upset had been due to how I felt about him, and there he was, patting my back!  It was really strange, but again, he’s a great human being.  He asked no questions and expected nothing in return.

The year was almost over at that point.  It ended without too much change, other than I found out that Mr. I had been dating someone.  I did my very best not to be upset, but obviously easier said than done.  I spent a large amount of this summer being really sad about it.  By the later part of the summer, it had been long enough since I had seen him that I thought I was starting to get over him.  Then I got my class schedule.

It turns out Mr. I requested that I be in his class this year.  Believe me, I knew this was trouble.  I think anyone could see that this was trouble.  It only took me about a week to feel the same way I did at the end of last year, only this time it hurts a lot fucking worse due to how I now have to live with the fact that he is happily dating someone else while I’m stuck as a senior in a school full of people I generally don’t fit in with.  I can’t transfer out of his class, I can’t seem to just ‘get over it’, and our friendship is seriously suffering.  He’s worried about me again, but I’ve been doing my best to shrug it off, because I know the moment I tell him what’s actually going on is the moment he will be legally and morally required to end whatever the hell this relationship has become.

This post has been a big pity party, I know, but I’m so tired of being quiet about it. It has now been almost a year of being alone with these feelings.  I haven’t told anyone.

Not an easy way to do this without turning it into a rant and confusing the issue. When her period rolls around she becomes overwrought. Last night she was crying, then yelling, then steamrolling over all my faults. Sure, she had some legitimate concerns, but she doesn't really seemed interested in resolution. I try to reason with her, i apologies and suggest alternative solutions. I try to help her understand why i struggle with things and point out where she is being irrational. I tell her i love her over and over. Finally, after about 5 hours of her unloading on me, i hit a wall and just flip out. I just start yelling and ranting, i punch a wall, hurting my hand*ouch*. (Before you ask i have never hit anyone outside a sparring match). Eventually i start babbling and crying. Amazingly this seems to make her more approachable. She calms down we hold each other kiss, make up, etc..

next day she wakes up, goes to the bathroom and says ""oh shit i'm on my period"". Meanwhile i'm laying in bed thinking, doing the facepalm motion quitely

He has told me that this is due to his abuse, and that these women are his coping mechanisms. Either I fulfill all his needs, or he talks to them. He manipulates these women and is currently conversing with an ex of his, a seventeen year old girl (talking to her in the exact same way he used to talk to me when we were long distance. I have warned her. She has elected not to listen), and an engaged woman from Canada. He has spat on me, uttered the phrase, ""Don't take these girls away or I'll kill myself."" and has taken a hammer to the wall of our home.

If I'm in the wrong sub I apologize and please direct me. /askreddit sent me here.

There's a long backstory I can spill, but the gist of it is this:

**tl;dr I met and found the love of my life in my early 20's. Somehow I inadvertently fucked it up and it's ruined everything since. I either have to find a way past it or find a way back. The latter, please. I will consider anything.**

More detail for now:

I was 24 back then and she was 23.

Between 03-05, I dated a completely awesome chick. Perfect in every way, etc. We met because I was in a band and she was in awe of me, so I thought.

Meeting her was the single most powerful moment of my life. Her eyes that night. I knew everything, yet nothing, and could do no wrong. From that instant I knew we had a future. I've never felt this way about anyone. And with a sinking feeling I know I never will again.

After a year it only got better as far as I could tell.

Basically it ended because she had developed ""feelings for someone else"". Cheated. Once I brought up the obvious distance, it was over, and she left, and I only really saw her once more.

Far as I know she married him. She had stayed in the same place for years until, big laugh, the once chance I have to get close again she moves out of state. Of course there's been no contact.

Me, meanwhile, I've developed a nice drinking habit and taken up bad choices. Married someone I didn't love, self-destruction, etc.

I know I fucked up with her, but I had no idea just how much until years later.

Now I just wish I could apologize. And make it right. It feels impossible, but it can't be. It can't. I've never had an amazing girl say the words ""soul mate"" to me before. And if love and all that fancy shit is bs, well, I give up.

I'm going to list this like it's a tech question. 

I'm male, 28. 
girl is 27. 
I love talking and am a bit needy, she hates talking and hates the idea of being needy.

Relationship's been kicking along for about six months. 
Last time I saw her it was before just going to sleep together, and she said she felt uneasy about our relationship, but was too tired to talk. Since then no calls/texts replied to. (Sent maybe 5, all conversational.)
I think her phone might be dead, but I'm really bummed out that she isn't considerate enough to call me from another phone to let me know. Called her home, said hello to her mum; dont' really want to do that again incase she's actually avoiding me.

Situation: I feel like she's avoiding me and I'm freaking out.

I spend a lot of time feeling uneasy about my relationship, and react to that by thinking about it, a lot. Like I'm trying to figure-it-out, but as much as part of the problem is the relationship and the girl, there's definitely part of it which is my own insecurity and lack of independence.

Right now I should be doing a job application for an amazing audio position, but instead I'm spending all my time thinking about this girl and if we're having issues, wondering what's going on between us, wondering if it's all in my head etc.

Realistically, I saw her briefly yesterday. But it doesn't feel like that, it feels like a bloody long time, and that makes me wonder what's up with my head.

I reckon I need to be more into my own stuff, instead of putting so much of my personal validation on how things are with her. I'd like advice on how to do that.

They have been a very good support system but at the end of the day, I am generally just disappointed with people around me, myself included. People I get along with don't seem to value me as much I value them and people I don't really get along with seem to value me more than I value them. I always try to be nice to the latter few folks; I usually respond to their messages and go out with them even if it's not the most fun of times for all (at least me) involved. 

I don't know where this stems from. I just feel alone. Like I can't talk to anyone very easily but I actually do. I talk about problems or things on my mind far too easily with those I know. They then try to give the quickest solution and then move on to what's bothering them and then there are those kinds that just want me to move on to my next problem without really opening up about themselves even if I probe; this is after we've exhausted any other common topics. I feel tired of this superficial interaction. It's like that line from Fight Club, people are just waiting for their turn to talk. Sometimes, I guess I'm at fault here too. I try to change it when I catch myself doing that.

I'm a female in my mid-twenties. I'm increasingly finding it difficult to put up a face. My closest friend from my high school days and I have pretty much drifted apart. However, I'm still friends with her and we still talk about our most personal issues (or at least I think so) on a periodic basis. But it's clear that neither of us are priorities for each other and we just do this for old times' sake. I feel empty discussing any important issue with her. Then there are newer friends that I'm close to and we meet up for a good laugh and are there for me at my times of need. But sometimes when I'm there for them, I feel like I'm not really the one that they want around at that point. I see that what they really want is attention from the opposite sex and I feel a bit helpless and useless. 

And talking about attention from the opposite sex, I really don't want to have a serious relationship until I'm happy being by myself and in my company. Sometimes, I just wanna shut everyone I know off to see how I'd do on my own. But I don't wind up doing that ever. And in the meantime, I do feel like I want someone that will just be there whenever I want and I did have this sort of a relationship with a friend miles away. Although it was over phone or web, the interactions seemed genuine, exciting and well, he was there when I usually needed him. This then went on to an abrupt end from his side as he didn't want to continue being just friends and we couldn't be anything more. I don't know. I'm just generally of the opinion that serious relationships are useless unless they are the one you want to wind up spending the rest of your life with and frankly, I haven't met anyone like that and I kinda seem to not want to, given my lack of solo happiness achievement. I don't know if any of this makes sense. I guess I think it's a weakness of sorts to rely on others, friendship or relationship wise, yet I do seek these sort of interactions and wind up fucking it up or being disappointed with it all. I'm sorry it's all a massive convoluted rant. I've just been getting annoyed at everyone around me and myself. I really want to be happy with myself and by myself but I sort of do yearn for a connection that I had with the friend that was miles away. I guess humans are social creatures and want some sort of interaction with others and that's why people get pets and aren't just happy spending time with books and music, as these things don't necessarily respond to you in the usual frame of mind. 

P.S: Also, I think I've been far too emotional the past few months, which I usually am not. And this has ruined a potential fling for me. Big time. I don't know why I let emotions get the better of me of late and I hate what I've done as a result of that (majorly clingy, needy shit that I don't want to think about as I'm not normally like that and have in fact scolded friends of mine for being that way in their interactions with dates and now feel let down by myself and hypocritical.). I also happen to think giving in to emotions is a weakness and I've always tried not to do that. And recently, I've just teared up a few times while speaking to said fling as I actually fucked up majorly and this is painting an uncharacteristic picture of me.

When I was seeing my ex, we started out with him making all the first moves and us moving fairly fast as a couple. However, I was healthily detached at the beginning (or so I think) and progressively became more attached to him. Eventually, it felt like he barely knew me and wanted to have nothing to do with me while I was pleading for him to show some affection. I was constantly overthinking things and being very anxious and stressed out. It got so bad I had to start going to a counselor because I was feeling depressed, and I eventually broke up with him.

Now, half a year later, everything is going well in my life and I'm really feeling good about myself. I recently started talking to a guy who I like a lot, and I'd like to see where it goes. However, I've noticed myself getting quite emotionally invested in him already and it's freaking me out. I can feel myself getting too attached and overthinking everything, and I don't know how to deal with these emotions. I'm trying to keep my cool but it's stressing me out to the point where I'm wondering if I shouldn't just give up on relationships.

But as much as I could identify with it, I also felt so vastly different. I'm not even sure if I can call myself a ""true introvert"" or if I'm just withdrawn, or somewhere in between. On a point-by-point breakdown of the comic:

I don't find other people ""obnoxious"", don't find interaction annoying or wasteful, more like... intimidating (well, most of the time, some people I do find annoying and don't wanna waste my time with, but most I'm just intimidated by).

When I do get over it, I've got the tendencies of an extrovert, or more specifically: I draw on the energy of others... Being social doesn't really exhaust me, it invigorates me. It's almost like a drug to me, and I can get addicted to it too easily. Especially if I'm the one getting all the attention.

But everything else here sounds familiar/accurate. I can create my own energy, I don't often spend the energy I create for myself on others, not particularly demanding about most others spending their energy on me (it's a nice ""treat"", but there are some people I get demanding with, there's that ""drug"" thing I mentioned), I avoid people in similar ways to most introverts, if I don't feel welcome I don't waste my time, I live in my own little world most of the time, kind of have my own personal space bubble... I do feel as though I'm an introvert on some level, and most people first meeting me would identify me as such.

As I said, I can't be sure anymore, and I wanna figure it out exactly.

It's probably a bad thing, and perhaps a larger issues for a later time but labels have always mattered to me. It gives me certainty about my identity, especially if I see it as a positive label, I will own it, openly describe myself in that way, and even just knowing who I am boosts my confidence. If it's a negative one, like knowing what's causing my issues... It's easier for me to find fixes for, or just find out how to live with.

From I was 6 years old or so, I hated my nose because it is long and pointy. My younger brothers used to tease me about it all the time and I remember I got some remarks from other kids as well. 

When I was about 14-18 years old I kind of 'accepted' my nose and I felt really good about myself - I really didn't care any longer about any negative remarks (and I did not get any either since I apparently no longer cared about what other people said). I figured out that my nose wasn't all that bad, and looking back on the pictures of me I looked quite good then. Then suddenly, after I turned 18 or 19, I got real bad acne that lasted until my mid 20's. Now my skin has cleared up, but I (again) hate my nose. It is too prominent and I hate to look at myself in the mirror. Not only that, all the acne products had dried out my skin and I've gotten a few wrinkles as well. The result is that I hate my nose AND I feel like I look much older than I really am. My friends say that my 'wrinkles'/lines are hardly noticeable or even non-existing, and that I don't look neither old nor ugly. But how can I believe them when the mirror says otherwise? Recenly, my friend's 5-year old kid called me 'Pinocchio' , because of my nose. I just laughed at it, but you know what they say about children and speaking the truth... It did not really help my already shitty self-image.

It's been many years since I've felt good about my looks, and I spend most of my free time in front of my computer. I rarely go out, because I feel too ugly to even bother to dress up, or whatever. It's been years since I've felt good and confident. I can hardly remember the last time. It is bothering me, because I want my confidence back again. 

I've registred on OKC, and I get a great amount of compliments there, but I only wish compliments could help me. They really don't help at all, since I don't believe that they are genuine. I just want to feel good about myself, so therefore I have no need for compliments when I am not able to believe them. I've had some boyfriends and some other guys that think that I am beautiful/whatever, but the only explanation for that, as far as I can see, is that they are either blind or have poor taste.

I considered plastic surgery but I've come to the conclusion that (I've imagined how they would fix it) it would look unnatural and/or even worse. So I just have to live with it. It is REALLY hard to accept that you're ugly, or not as good looking as you'd wish to be. I know it may sound superficial, but I am not trying to look good for anyone else but myself. I want to look good and feel good, but the face I see every day, I feel like it is not 'me'. I've changed since my teens, but not for the good. Because of my low self-esteem and shitty self-image I am not as social as I wish to be, and I rarely meet new people, or hang out much (in public at least) with the friends that I already have. 

I love my body however (I'm skinny/athletic), and I am super confident when it comes to that.... It's only my face that I can't stand and that has been the source for my shitty self-image/self esteem.

I have no idea what to do or how to fix this. Has anyone experienced this - if so, how did you overcome/fix this?

She is the most amazing woman I've ever met. She is the only woman I know who I could see myself being with for any extended length of time. Maybe I just have shitty friends, but I've never met another woman who I felt that I clicked with well enough to be in a long-term relationship with. Even my close friends (male and female) start to get on my nerves after spending any length of time with them, but even after 6 years with my girlfriend, I still get excited about spending time with her. I've never once thought ""Oh hell, she wants to hang out again."" Our sex life is great -- we've obviously lost a bit of the initial passion after 6 years together, but we still have a lot of fun. I love her, I'm sexually attracted to her, we get along great, and I just have fun with her. I couldn't imagine a life without her, and I am legitimately excited about the prospect of spending the rest of my life with her.

**However.**

She was my first. Not my first girlfriend, but my first sexual partner. I've never been with anyone but her, and I am, for lack of a better term, unbearably curious about sex with other women. I want to experience what it's like to go through all that with another woman. The chemistry, the tension, the flirting, the foreplay, the sex, all of it. I've never cheated on her, but I have a very hard time not playing along when other women start flirting with me. It's like I'm addicted to sexual tension, and it has almost gotten me into trouble in the past when I realized it was about to go past ""harmless"" flirtation and become full-on cheating (most notably, the time I came very close to having sex with my best friend's wife -- something I still feel awful about, but that's neither here nor there). 

So this is my dilemma, and it's the biggest reason why I haven't asked her to marry me yet. There's no doubt in my mind that I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but I just can't shake that desire to experience meaningless casual sex with another woman, even if it's just once or twice, before I fully commit myself to her for life. Like I said, it's like an intense curiosity that just keeps coming up. 

We've talked about it before, and she knows that this is an issue for me. She's been very understanding and supportive, but we've never really come to a definitive solution. Part of me wants to bring up the option of having an open relationship (staying emotionally monogamous but free to have sex with other people) for a little while before settling down, but I'm kind of afraid to even broach the subject. I feel awful for even wanting this -- I honestly believe I have found my soulmate, the most beautiful and perfect (for me) woman in the world, who is everything I could ever ask for, and more... and I'm still not satisfied. Am I crazy? Is this an unreasonable thing for me to suggest?

My girlfriend is so happy all the time, always positive, and is the biggest sweetheart I know (one of the many reasons I love her so much!), and I can't help but be scared to death that some bastard will take advantage of her or hurt her when I'm not around, changing her for the rest of her life.  

We've been dating for almost two years now, so I trust her completely.  In no way do I suspect that she would accidentally lead another guy on, causing a misunderstanding, because she is very good about that sort of thing.  My main source of worry is that it only requires a lapse in concentration to find yourself cornered or pinned by a much stronger man. I trust her judgement as far as choices go, but I don't trust that she will always watch her back or be aware of her surroundings.  She is in shape, but I seriously doubt her ability to fight off a guy, much less one that threatens physical harm if she makes noise.  In fact, my worst nightmare is that a guy corners her, pulls a knife on her, then says ""if you make a sound, I'll kill you"" then rapes her.

I have ADHD, and I take medication for it.  I suspect that it makes me more anxious than I would normally be, but I also suspect that I'm just a naturally anxious person.  I'm a very detail oriented person, which means that I stress over small details.  I over-think a great deal of things, meaning that I give more thought to unlikely possibilities than most people would (such as my girlfriend being raped every time she is out with a group of people I don't know).

Basically I have asked her to let me know what she is up to so I know where she is if something happens, and to inform me when she knows she will be out of contact (for instance, if she is going to be in a pool).  This helps me a lot, but if she forgets to do this I start to worry a lot, which stresses her out.

As a thirty-year-old guy, I'm actually kind of embarassed to be asking this question. I apologize for the horrible writing that follows; I am usually a better writer than this. I'm not used to writing about my feelings.

At work I have these two guy colleagues, call them A and B. A is the the sort of man you can tell that he's gay in about 10 seconds after meeting him; B is closeted and married. A and B are closer friends than I am with either; although I have slept once with A and been in a few occasions extra touchy with B (back rubs and that sort of things).

The thing is, I am jealous of their relationship. A has this habit of openly displaying affections, and when he gets touchy with B, I get jealous. I should mention that some time ago A had a crush on me. Although I did not quite reciprocated then, I did like the ego boost having someone crushing on you provided. I am a person of severe self-esteem issues who haven't dated in years and having someone told me that I was handsome made me feel very good about myself.  I did develop a soft spot for A and a crush for B.

On a few occasions though, when either of them made joke at my expense, I felt disrespected and made a fool of. Lately, I have resolved to become emotionally unattached to them, to talk about work only at the office and to stop the usual after-hours socializing. I just don't want to go through the whole roller-coaster of emotions again. I know how immature and childish that sounds, and trust me, I don't like myself too.

I have introspected enough to realize that this is not just about two guys I have sort of feeling for in the office. Other people's happiness only accentuate to me my unhappiness. News of friends getting married and having children depresses me.

I tried looking for an active /r/therapy or something, but no dice. r/Askreddit returned nothing.

Something's been bugging me for a long time, and I know it's common among young males. At first I thought it was some sort of depression, or some sort of mood change which had been temporarily altering my thoughts, but then I realized that it was intrinsic to me, that it was almost a core belief. I don't even think about it - it's completely automatic.

For what it's worth, I'm also aware of the self-perpetuating nature of self-diagnosis.

The only way I can really describe it is to describe the nature of my thoughts, which makes the whole thing very blunt, and almost petty; juvenile. Here goes.

I see a woman and I feel unworthy. Not in a kingly sense, as if she were my queen - only that I shouldn't even bother, that she wouldn't ever go after someone like me: in my mind, a picture forms of some husky man with broad shoulders and I say, ""She can have that. Why would she bother with me?""

At least, that's a more childish view of what I believe. I know that it doesn't play in reverse: opportunities are limited (you take what you get), and a woman can't simply choose whoever she wants from some sort of lineup.

I don't go after myself in the same way other people do, discounting my worth as a partner based on a lacking personality or a sour disposition. I guess it's more about physical attractiveness - it's automatic for me to judge myself as unworthy.

Maybe it would be better described by one word:

""Really?""

Obviously, trying to think my way out of it hasn't worked so well, because the thought is rooted so deep in my mind that everything I say only validates the perspective I already have of myself. I know I am smart, and capable, and blah, blah, blah - but it persists.

What do I do?

Also, if you could point me to a more appropriate subreddit, that would be very helpful. Thanks for reading.

How to deal with it as an adult?,poop_dollar_,7,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/xb78f/parent_issues_mental_abuse_how_to_deal_with_it_as/,"I'll preface this by saying both of my parents are very anxious people. Extremely. They've both been on anti-depressants and benzos. So its no wonder I'm the same way.

I feel as though my parents were/are un-intentionally abusive to me and my brother. We both grew up with severe anxiety, depression, and emotional problems. My brother spent many childhood years being dragged to psychologists by our high strung mother. Despite all odds, we've both grown up to be decently well-adjusted adults. We both have our bachelors degrees and we both have a good amount of friends. We both definitely have our quirks though. I grew up with terrible self esteem and zero confidence, and through no help from my parents I have for the most part overcome that. The only time I revisit those feelings tend to be when I'm around my parents. I feel as though I am a better person away from them, and I think my brother probably feels the same way. Anytime I spend around either of my parents, I leave feeling negative, bad about myself, and anxious. I love traveling for this reason, I would leave my family and travel the world forever if I didn't feel guilty for leaving them.

Our parents ""love"" us and support us materialistically as much as they can. I also know they worry about us a lot. But there's just this overwhelming negative weight in their presence. My mom is very judgmental and my dad worries about money CONSTANTLY. 90% of my dad and I's conversations are just stressing over what to do about my bills, my student loans, my job, my financial plans, my 401k, etc. Anytime I try to talk to either of my parents about stuff that makes me happy and interests me such as my friends, art, movies, music, world politics, books, etc., their eyes just glaze over and they instantly zone out.

I should also mention neither of my parents have any sense of humor. Zero.

Also, growing up my brother and I were very promising. My brother is very intelligent, an amazing artist, and WAS a promising tennis player. I WAS a promising artist, dancer, tennis player, and pianist. I'm not going to wallow in self-pity because I know I am still very young and can pick back up... but I quit doing all of these things I loved in my mid-teen years due to pressure to be the best and a constant feeling of not being good enough. 

Now both of my parents are older (in their 60s) and I am 23. My mom will probably live to be about 150 and my dad probably won't live another decade. He has terrible health problems and is on 24 hr oxygen due to a lifetime of smoking cigarettes. He can barely take care of himself and generally has this toxic attitude of self-pity and negativity and helplessness.

Now I have learned from my parents exactly what attitude NOT to have in life. But when I am around them it just drags me down. My problem here is that they have never been maliciously downright abusive. It is all very under the table. I know my mother's parents were both crazy and her dad was physically abusive. The way she is surely isn't her fault. She is pretty damn cold and non-understanding nonetheless. When I started my period, I was afraid to tell her because I thought she would get mad at me. I don't think my dad's parents were abusive at all, maybe just high stress?

I don't think I would be able to deal with the guilt of leaving my good-intentioned? father in his state of health alone (parents are divorced). But god damnit I hate to admit it life is so much better and light and optimistic with my family out of my mind.

I have spent the greater part of the last 10 years learning to overcome my own social anxiety and lack of self-esteem/confidence as well as improve my sense of humor and communication skills by myself ....and to much avail. My only digression ever is turning back to my family.

I know this has been a big clusterfuck of a composition. But I must vent. I feel torn between improving my life and mental health and the guilt of abandoning my family, most specifically my father in his ill health.

Aside from seeing a counselor, what should I do?

But I'm not here to rant, I sincerely want to figure out what the issues are and what I need to change in order to be happy. 

I have never had sex or been in a relationship, nor have I had any signs of interest from the opposite sex (this one is the killer). Nothing, no gossip of a girl thinking I'm cute in high school or anything. I have lived my life unsure if there has ever been a girl that thought I was at least cute. You can imagine how devastating that has been on my self esteem and happiness over all, and how envious it makes me hearing about other couples.

The main thing I keep thinking is it's my appearance. I'm almost convinced I'm ugly. I don't want to believe it though because people keep telling me I'm not. I posted to /r/amiguly and the majority of comments said I wasn't ugly. Some said I was handsome. Unfortunately though, the overwhelming majority of these comments were from guys. I think that there may be something about my appearance that may just be unattractive to girls. Not sure as of yet.

Anyway, I consider my self to be just as friendly as the average guy, if not more so. I can't understand anything I've done differently in terms of my behaviour or how I carry myself. So having exhausted all possible explanations, I have come here to see what else there could be that I may have not considered. I would really appreciate any suggestions explaining why the hell I feel like a women repellant. Thanks.


TL;DR I have never been in a relationship even though I've been told I'm handsome and am social and confident in front of others.

I made multiple efforts to talk to her after she left me and I never got a response, so ""getting over"" her wasn't that bad for a while. I was doing really well until a couple days ago. I went to my friend's house who lives near her. He told me that she gave him a bag of jackets and shirts of mine that she had, which was nice, but also a folder of notes we had exchanged and pictures of us. Looking in it really hurt me, because it contained some really old stuff. The oldest note dated back to November of 2010, a couple of days before we had even begun dating. I have no idea why she would think I would want this, and think that perhaps she was just trying to make me feel bad. My friend was convinced we should burn the folder, and I nearly went with it, but I couldn't bring myself to. That morning before he woke up, I opened the folder again and took out the oldest note. I folded it and put it in my pocket. I went ahead and read the rest of the notes and looked at the pictures. I cried for several minutes. I was afraid my friend would wake up. I eventually closed the folder. For some reason, I texted her saying something like ""Hey, thanks for the clothes! I kept one of the pieces of paper from the folder to put in a box of other stuff of us."" I have no idea why I said that. I knew she wouldn't reply, and I knew I probably sounded more creepy than anything, but I did it anyway. When I left his house, I told him to dispose of the folder in whatever fashion he wanted. When I got home, I put the note in the box. I never plan to open the box again, but here is where we reach my issues. I have a deep connection to the inanimate mementos she and I shared. I have the stuffed animals she gave me throughout our relationship put away, but I will never just be able to get rid of them, despite how much I know she doesn't care about me. My other problem is that I can't just abandon her from my life. That is exactly what she wants and I can't do it. No matter what, I have a difficult time accepting that we may never speak again. Again, it's not like I want to date her again. I don't. She was emotionally abusive and too self-interested to take my feelings into consideration as much as her own. But still, the mementos we shared mean so much to me and I can't seem to stop caring about them like she did. I also wish I could at least occasionally speak to her.

I am 21/F.

1.Family- Dad is emotionally abusive. Mom is a door mat. They work at the same place, it is allowed there. He is above her. I know he doesn't treat her well, because I had my intership there for a while. I tell her to leave but she won't because she knows his behavior won't change and she'd rather that he removes his anger on her than others. When they come home, almost 80% of the times, they have a screaming match going on and this has been happening since 6 years. I don't know what changed then. I have sheltered my sibling as much as I could. We have spent way too many nights crying ourselves to sleep. Also, since a couple of years, my grandmother has been staying with us cuz my grandpa passed away :( We can *not* put her in an oldage home. She and my mother never got along well. She(granny) loves to brew up fights between my parents. The thing is she's sneakily manipulative and they know it but still fall for it. It's all too WTF and frustrating to tolerate. Also, it has made us very very cynical in life.

2. Me- I am moody. Very. At times I am happy, other times I am depressed. I would self-diagnose myself as bipolar, except the sad parts kick in only after bad family time. My study/career is in a major dump. I am about to finish my education, yet have little work experience. It terrifies me. The thought of working. As in I literally panic and start sobbing. I know it's pathetic, but for the love of God, I wish I knew why. Also, that internship at my parents' office was a nightmare. My dad thinks I am a useless good-for-nothing since I am currently sitting at home. Money is not that low, that I *must* earn. He just wants me out. Who wouldn't? I get that. But he constantly taunts me and in front of everyone. And then there are times when he's sweet and concerned like a normal father. My mom will say/agree with everything he says about this. I have told her a million times that her adding to it, doesn't help at all. I am a very communicative person. They know everything about how I feel. There's no doubt at all that I am very troubled by the tension in the house and how much they are pressurising me. Yet they do *nothing* to help.

3. Love- So obviously I was with a guy who loved me and never pointed out anything wrong in me. That ended though. We realized how dysfunctional we were behaving. But now I am worried I will always go for guys who give me approval. I do not want that. I have seen people belittling their own selves based on other people's opinions. Also, I have body image issues. I am trying to work on that. Thankfully I would never stop eating. Eat healthy, yes. But dieting, no way. So that should probably make me feel a bit better.


The problem still remains that I can not live like this. Constantly being driven crazy. I know I must improve, but can't handle the crazy in the house! I need to move out, but I can not afford to for another 2 years. I need to know how to cope with this, without aging 10 years, everytime they fight and create scenes.

Okay, maybe the title is a bit misleading, it should be more like 'I can't talk to girls'. 

This is going to be a long read for you, just a heads up. 

I was sort of in a relationship a couple of years ago, and long story short, it ended up sour between me and the girl. 

Since then, I've detracted from this relationships bs, thinking my life would be better without girls and that has probably contributed to the predicament I'm in now. 

Here is my problem: 
I have girl friends, I can talk to these girls without a problem and its normal day-to-day talk. Its fine.

Then there are girls who I can see myself in a relationship with. Can I talk to any of these girls? No. 

Why?

Because I'm terrible at conversing with these girls, its just awkward for me and probably for her just sitting in silence together like that. 

I don't know, maybe they are all just shy, I know I am. 

Face to face I'm one boring mofo. Over the internet I'm more open for some reason. I have this thing where my face completely flushes red in awkward situations with girls. It just makes me feel agitated and uncomfortable and they are probably thinking 'wtf is wrong with him' which really doesn't help. 

Why is it so hard to talk or even start a conversation with a girl? 

How can I become more confident at talking to girls/strangers. Part of the reason I think I'm so bad at is because I'm worried that they won't like me or think I'm just a prick. I just want to say fuck it, ""I like you, do you like me?"" but I dont know if I am capable of that.

I'm in a four year relationship with a guy I met at 17, I'm now 21. He's 27. A good country-come-suburbs boy with a pure heart, a good job, who wants to live a normal and happy life. Wants the house, the wife, the kids and he wants that all with me. He's perfect on paper and in public, and behind closed doors he's a nervous wreck with OCD and control issues. 

We have been on shaky ground for two years. He's very possessive and has been from day one, at which point it seemed cute, because I was 17 and didn't know shit about relationships. Eventually, the constant phone calls and the jealousy and the guilt trips about spending time with anyone but him wore me down. I have no life experiences. No previous lengthy relationships like him, no overseas travels like him, no partying like him, no nothing. I don't need another father, I have a good one.

I literally feel sickened by his touch. I fell in love with someone else. Not infatuation, full blown love. The other one, he understands me. I have always been able to be honest about being somewhat dead inside, and he's quite similar. I want to be with him so badly it hurts. Our relationship was discovered by my SO and he is shattered. Under all his grief, I saw that wholesome person who has his own problems, and I saw that I was responsible for picking away any progress he might have made by cavorting about with someone else. He was already insecure and paranoid, and I have proven to him that he has every reason to be.

I am still here with him, because he wants me to be. Because I know I will lose my best friend (albeit also a partner whose sexual advances make my blood run cold, and one who stifles me every which way) and I know I will lose everyone else I have come to love during our relationship. Our mutual friends will rightfully take his side. I will have to go far away. The guilt alone is keeping me here.

I am going to lose the love of my life. The one that understands me. The one that ignites every sense of desire I have. And I deserve every last bit of it.

I’ve fallen into this pattern with my relationships with close guy friends. I’ll get a guy friend who eventually becomes my best friend – my confidant. I tell him everything, I use him as a support system, he tells me things. It’s awesome. It’s fun. It’s stress free. We always promise that we’re only friends – that we could never see each other as more than that. Then they start to like me and tell me so. This has happened three or four times in the past few years, and I hate it. I feel betrayed by them, and guilty – I don’t ask for them to like me. I can’t make myself like them. It hurts everyone. I’m not even a pretty girl – I don’t know why this keeps happening.

The most recent occurrence really hurt me. I just finished my junior year of college. At the beginning of the year I met this really awesome guy. Let’s call him J. J’s solid, quiet, blissfully level-headed (I’m the opposite). We become fast friends and I tell him everything about myself – and he tells me a few things about himself over the course of the year as well – but I’m never able to read him, able to understand him. This doesn’t bother me until later on though. Early on we agree that we only see each other as brother and sister.

The year progresses and we come to the night of a mutual friend’s 21st. He doesn’t usually drink, but agreed to come out with us for once. We all drink more than we should and we end up talking about our relationship – he tells me he doesn’t know how he feels about me. I tell him I can’t reciprocate.

We talk the next day when we’re both sober, and we agree to keep things normal. I’m relieved – I don’t want to lose another friend to this. He slowly pulls away from me after that. Stops chilling with me at my apartment after classes, ignores my texts, is mysteriously absent from our group of friends, ect.

A few weeks later I start dating a random guy. This is an odd occurrence for me – I prefer to be single. But this guy is sweet and doesn’t know me well, so it’s easy. It’s fun and simple and we both know it will never be more than that. If I dated J, it would have to mean something.

Once the random guy shows up, J starts ignoring me completely. I know exactly what happened – that I friendzoned him and he can’t take the rejection. That being just friends hurts him and he wants more than that. But I can’t help but lie awake at night. It’s been months since he ditched me, and I can’t get over it. It all feels like a lie – our friendship. Like all those nights driving around the city and just talking were all a lie.

Reddit, how do I stop this? I can’t just stop having guy friends (they’re so much easier to talk to), but I don’t know why this keeps happening to me. It hurts everyone. I’m so tired of people leaving me. I just want them to stop expecting so much from me.

I’m 16 (17 in less than a week), and my father and brother both died in the past year and a half, from cancer and a boating accident respectively. I am currently seeing a grief counselor, but for the most part I have accepted what has happened.

I am becoming worried that the deaths in my recent past make it hard for me to really connect with anyone new. I have unconsciously mentally divided my life into “pre-death” and “post-death”, and it’s hard for me to become too connected to people from “post-death”. This is partially because it is just so hard to explain when it comes up. I’m 17 and half my immediate family is dead. It is also partially because I feel somehow different from my peers. I feel as if the pain I’ve experienced is mine to bear, if that makes sense. Those who have no experience with it will just be overwhelmed, and those with their own issues don’t need my problems piled on top of theirs. In some ways (though I hate to put it like this), I feel more mature than many people my age.

This especially applies in a romantic sense. I’ve never had a romantic relationship, and now it feels like I... can’t. I don’t feel that I am able to trust someone else like that, or to make myself that vulnerable to another person. I feel like damaged goods.

I guess what I’m asking is has anyone else had a similar experience after the death of a loved one, and if so how did you work through it?

This school year was particularly difficult due depression and anxiety (which I recently realized I had). As of now I'm home and I manage a pool 4 days/week. I'll list the issues I'm concerned with:

* I don't have any desire to do anything anymore. During the school year, I skipped a lot of my classes and homework to browse the internet and play an MMO (two things that used to calm me down and keep me occupied) and my grades suffered as a result. When it comes to school I've been lacking motivation, and I don't think a different major would change this. Lately haven't been playing the MMO because it's becoming shitty, but that doesn't change that I'm on a computer. Reddit and the rest of the internet keeps me busy, but I wouldn't call it fun or a passion or anything like that. I can't think of anything that would seem fun to do in my free time.

* I don't have any close friends, and I'm starting to feel lonely as a result. However, I feel that I'm unable to form a close relationship with another person. This goes for romantic relationships as well. If a female walked up to me and expressed interest, I would probably tell her how shitty of a person I am and to not waste her time. I don't think anyone would want to form any kind of relationship with me because I'm some weird fucked up shut-in. 

* I have difficulty trusting anyone. When people say certain things (apologies for example) I judge their statement for sincerity, and most of the time I conclude that the person isn't sincere. This goes for actions as well, as example being the therapist I saw in college (I believed her to be very insincere and condescending). I'm starting to love faith in my parents as well.

* I hate disappointing people/letting people down. As I skipped classes I felt that the TAs/professors were disappointed in me, which spurred me to skip even more classes. I've been letting my parents down with my poor GPA. I think I disappoint myself more than anyone with my poor performance in school. This is the main reason why I don't want to commit suicide; it'd upset my parents.

* Maybe this goes without saying, but I'm depressed and feel shitty most of the time.

* I'm easily irritable. I often yell at people in my head. But I do a good job of not showing it.

* Despite my parents being good to me I can't really say that I love them. I do however love my dog.

* This is where it gets a little fucked up, and despite anonymity this isn't the easiest thing to say. If text can be NSFW then this is NSFW. I don't look at porn on the computer at all. I'm being serious. I guess I don't masturbate in the normal way (never really tried). The only way I've masturbated was by putting my hand on my crotch while in bed. I get off to the thought of turning into a little girl (like 6-8) and losing all knowledge I had as a 20 year old male. I've rationalized this to be a desire to restart life with a completely clean slate as a totally different person. I've often thought (for a pretty long time) that if I were a girl life would be easier for me since I'm not an outgoing or confident person. Don't harp on this too much; I don't think I'm trans and even if I am trans I don't want anything to do with sex change. But you can mention it if you want. I haven't been able to masturbate at all lately due to my taking Celexa, but I think that's somewhat of an improvement.

That's everything that I can think of for now. Please comment on what you think or what you should do. I just started seeing a therapist near my home, but after the first meeting I think she underestimates my problems (""Let's help you be more social""). I'm sure we'll get more detailed as the sessions go on, but that's how it is for the time being. I'm on my second week of celexa, so I'm also waiting for that to kick in.

I'm currently nearing the end of my first semester of my final year of high school. The previous year in my last semester of school, I did horribly in assessments and exams. I was very depressed and self-pitiful, and my life was directionless. I've always had a bit of a problem with schoolwork like any student does, but last year I really dropped the ball; not studying for exams at all, handing in essays and papers with nothing more than a paragraph of text, etc. I was horribly lazy, and ended up getting C's or D's in most of my subjects. Luckily for me, where I live, only the final year of highschool counts towards my exit mark.

Since the beginning of this year I have managed to mostly pull myself out of my depressed state and take school a bit more seriously. I have been going well; finishing assignments and completing exams at a satisfactory standard, but it seems I've dropped the ball again. I have a major IT assignment due tomorrow, which I've left until the last night. This is **not** the kind of assignment I can just do in one night, either, it's very lengthy and involves lots of coding and documentation and such. There's no way I can do this and get anything better than an E.
Things have been fine all up until now. I've dipped back into depression again after a relationship with a good friend going horribly wrong last week.

I would like to blame my lack of motivation on that, but I don't think that's it. I believe this is a huge problem, and I don't know if I'm even cut out for school. I don't think I'll have as good as an exit mark as I want to have, and I'm seriously afraid of life after school; how will I do in uni if I go, will I be able to hold up a job, etc.

I don't really know why I'm posting here, just to vent, I guess.

This makes me do two things simultaneously with acquaintances. A. I talk nonstop. B. Every few minutes I lash out verbally at the people around me. I'm mean. It kills me, because I am not an asshole on the inside. Every day my introversion requires me to mull over all social interactions that occurred, and it always leaves me with sorrow. Example: A girl I work with is totally into me, she's cute, gorgeously clear blue eyes. After work, as we walked to the parking lot, she thanked me for a wonderful day. I told her to go to hell, and laughed, like it was a joke. I can pick up girls for one-night-stands like nobody's businesses, but anything lengthy and things don't work out due to my abrasiveness. The only people who actually enjoy my company are the ones who stick around me long enough for me to become comfortable and somewhat relax around them. Then I'm not panicking, and I am myself.

I am not just looking for female input, any input would be nice.) 

Ok before I start I want to say that I am willing to expand on anything I write just let me know and I will explain in greater detail. 

Some info about me, 23 years old, male, studying computer science, meh build (but I have been working out regularly for a year now and have lost 40 pounds,) Indian (red-dot, flying-carpet kind :P)

So for the confessions, the biggest one being that I am a virgin (not embarrassed of this in any way shape or form,) my first kiss was a few months ago but it was more of a peck and she initiated it (damn woman stole my first kiss!) and I have never had a girlfriend.

I am not embarrassed of any of those things but I believe that the information may be important. 

Note: I am writing this with humbleness aside, I am not going to constantly excuse myself for saying things about me because I want this to be a blanket statement. I am NOT arrogant or stuck up I am writing this because I want to convey as much information as possible in the most efficient manner possible. Saying sorry every 4 lines works against this goal. I don't actually go around in real life saying these things about me to people. 

I as a guy am what almost all of my female friends have called, “impossible.” I am caring, sweet, kind, accepting, smart, funny, ect, ect, blah blah blah. I treat people I know with the utmost respect and I do all that I can to help them out. 

As a kid I was taught to be helpful and loving and that is exactly what I do, I find joy in making people happy. This is often seen as others as blind sacrifice but to me it isn't I think it over and I make sure I can help. I have often put my own happiness and well being aside to make my friends smile, because at the end of the day it makes me happy. 

I do this with EVERYBODY I consider a friend. 

I am perfectly happy with who I am, I am not depressed and I don't sit around screaming, “Oh woe is me!” It took me some time to get to this point but I have been here for a few years now and I couldn't be happier with who I am and where I am in my life. 

Now this leads into my girl problems. I am not a self fulfilling prophecy guy. I can't see myself with a woman (ever) but at the same time I know this is what I want from life, a partner. Whenever I meet a girl that I am interested in I don't hound after her. After getting to know her a bit I would usually ask them out. I never say date but instead I just phrase it along the lines of, “I want to get to know you better I think your cool blah blah blah.” I do this because this is honestly what I want to do on a “first date.” I want to talk to a girl and get to know her see if there is anything more than initial attraction. Yet this never works.

I have been shot down multiple times (7 in the past two months) and am always met with, “Look I think you are super cool and nice too, and you know what, there is some girl out there that will be super lucky to find you one day!” Hell I have had one woman literally say to me, “You are everything I have ever imagined in a man... what did I do to deserve you?” I feel like this mystical woman is more rare than a bloody unicorn-dodo hybrid at this point. 

Even though I am aware of all of these things I still feel like I am doing something wrong, something horribly wrong. I mean I am not a typical guy, I don't watch sports, I don't drink, I don't talk about women in sexual ways. I am not saying these things are bad (they aren't) but I find that there are a lot of things “typical guys” do that I don't. On the flip side I am no prissy boy either. I can fix cars (to a certain degree,) I enjoy yard work, and I think explosions are cool. I have soft palms (because I am a programmer) but I don't let this stop me from doing hard work from time to time. 

It is also common knowledge that I am a romantic. Sure I have never gotten to do anything for my girlfriends (*cough*) but I have helped plenty of my guy friends plan romantic dates and just romantic deeds. I know how to be sweet and what not.

I don't lock up in front of women, I am actually quite confident and talk to them like they are normal people. Of course I am an absolute gentlemen around women, I hold open doors, I pull out chairs, I complement them, and I show them respect.

A few months ago one of my friends who is a research psychologist and has been working on his PHD thesis asked me to help him out. He is doing research in the area of attraction, in essence matching two people based on a test, you know e-Harmony kind of stuff. Well since he needs a large data set he asks all of his friends to take the personality test from time to time. He usually doesn't give us the results but since he is getting near finishing it he has been sharing with some of us his data. He found my data set to be one of the most interesting because when presented to women something like 89% said that my profile had been doctored. Most women had to rate the profiles and most rated it, “Too good to be true.” I don't let this get to my head (especially since it is an unpublished study) but him and I did have a good laugh about it. 

Back to them women. On top of all of this I don't chase those typical, “Oh my god she is super hot!” kind of women. I was just never all that attracted to them and actually prefer girls who are cute over hot (if this makes sense.) I don't feel like I am playing out of my league as far as looks go but as time goes on I am starting to think that I may just be uglier than I thought. 

In all honesty I am at a loss for words, I have read over this post a few times and have no idea what other information I need to include. I know my family is accepting of whatever I do so I am not worried about that, I know my friends are supportive and will usually encourage me to do what makes me happy, and I have no real big issues with myself (other than I wish I was a better programmer but I am actively working on this.)  

One of my female friends recently brought up an angle I have never thought about but I feel like as if I should dismiss it. She says that because I actually am genuinely nice that most women may find it intimidating and scary. She summed it up by saying that women might believe that I am hiding something and that I really am a scumbag under this “ruse.” I kind of find this silly but it was something that made me think. 

So my question is, what could I possibly be doing wrong? Am I overlooking something? Is there something I can do to better my chances? What do women look for in men? Are women really intimidated by guys who seem nice off the bat?

I just think a detailed background is easier to relate to or work with.

I grew up in an alcoholic household, my family doesn't talk about emotions until things hit the fan or when someone is in some kind of trouble. Even then it is usually dragged out of them, I'm no exception. But I am different. My family talks amongst each other every week or every other week. I don't, I guess is that I just don't know what to say.

My brother is more socially adept than I am. My sister is, to a point. They both found a small group of friends or a good friend to do things with or talk to when they were in their teens continuing into their twenties.

I'm not like that. I talk to people and joke around in school. I occasionally get invited to events, parties and so on but I don't usually go. I just stay home and put myself into something, a book, a certain topic to research online, a game.

I enjoy being alone but I feel lonely. I feel bad for not socializing. I feel ostracized. I alienate people inadvertently and I don't want to. I like drinking coffee alone in the morning but I often just look out in my yard and think about conversations I'd like to have with my siblings or just someone. But I don't carry them out. If I call or text someone it's usually short and often awkward.

TL:DR I grew up in an alcoholic family where people avoid talking about emotions and often avoid each other. My siblings socialize well enough, I am bad at it, to say the least. I alienate people inadvertently and I regret it. I used to be completely oblivious to my lack of social skills; now, knowing my bad social skills I don't know what to do.

Either they are indifferent to work, they put off unpleasant tasks, or they half-ass them. Sometimes it's been a severe problem and sometimes it only bothers me on occasion.

I'm very driven and am mostly successful because I spent much of my teen years and early 20s living as some sort of productivity monk. In short, I spent a lot of time trying to be impressive and very little time being interesting. A lot of that is my parents influence: they always supported my decision to make the next big jump in school or whatever I was doing. Consequently, I didn't have a whole lot of friends, and most of them were far less productive than I.

These two things have come to a head in recent months. I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year, and we're relatively serious at this point. She occasionally drags her feet on chores that we agreed she would do (I pay rent, she takes care of laundry and such because she only works part-time), such as leaving clothes in a pile for a few days after washing them, but it's nothing major. She's never really had a steady job or career for more than a few years, mostly because she's gotten annoyed by some aspect of them and quit.

Now she's 31, and I care very deeply for her, but my parents insist that she will be a weight and drag me down instead of helping me succeed. And as we age, they say that she will remain directionless and needy. I feel like we've helped each other out: she's pulled me out of my shell to interact with her friends, and I've helped motivate her to keep working despite various major and minor annoyances. This parental approval problem been the only major and consistent source of tension in our relationship.

I'm very close to my family and trust their opinion. Most of their wisdom is usually right when I ask for advice, but talking to them about this sounds like the coming apocalypse. I'm not sure how reasonable that is. I recognize that we both spend time working on each other's hangups, but that seems to be one part of bonding. Are my parents right to worry? It seems kind of like a Cold War, and I'm poor Berlin.

**TL;DR**: Love my occasionally demotivated girlfriend. Parents think she will leech my success. I thought working on each other's hangups is important for bonding. I want my parents and my girlfriend to at least tolerate each other, but I'm worried that it's too late to change anyone's mind and my only solution for family harmony is a sad breakup.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_ukus6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/ukus6/26_m_attracted_to_lowmotivation_women_girlfriend/,

I am 33/m. I date an average amount and don't have a problem meeting new women. I'll enjoy spending time with them for a few days but then I completely lose interest. I need to stress that this has NOTHING to do with sex. I don't lose interest because I have or haven't had sex with them.

I've been in a couple of long term relationships. One was approximately 4 years on and off. The other was a year and a half. In both relationships we lived together for a large portion of the time. Even when I was in those long term relationships I wasn't emotionally attached to the women. I stayed with them out of comfort instead of satisfaction. I never had a wandering eye or wanted to see how green the grass was on the other side, I just wanted to be alone. I can be very selfish that way.

I'm afraid that I'll always be this way and it scares me. I'm so used to being alone that I don't know if I can adapt and share my life with someone else. In the last 2 years or so this has become very stressful and I get depressed often.

I didn't regret it at all, not until my brother found out the hard way. I've been overcome with guilt ever since. He ignores the issue entirely now, won't even talk about it. The thing is is I do not regret having sex with my boyfriend, really. It was a fine situation, and I'm glad I lost it in a way where I did not feel pressured or insecure. It's just the overwhelming sadness that everyone who got involved has to deal with a problem that I didn't see as one. It seems naive, but I didn't think having sex at this age was a necessarily bad thing to do. I grew up in an atmosphere where I was constantly degraded and harassed sexually, and I almost get a certain high off of forcing myself into things I don't want to do. It's never bothered me until now. I wanted to have sex, just not lose my virginity, if that makes sense. I'm very frivolous, young, and naive and I cannot sort through all my contradicting emotions that surround this issue as well as the issue itself. I should be listening to Skrillex and pounding down gallons of Mountain Dew or some shit but I'm having sex instead. I do not feel like a kid anymore, but not an adult or teenager either. I really want to talk to someone about everything that's led up to this, but talking to anyone I personally know would result in bad consequences.

I feel ridiculously inane posting this on here, but I'm hoping that posting this will prove not just to be embarrassing, but consoling as well. I regret my choices, but at the same time I wouldn't care if I did it again. I'd love to hear all of your stories, and I apologize for my ignorance. I just can't stand how this affecting everyone I know anymore. I need some sort of better understanding on what's going on right now from someone who's experienced this similarly.

tl;dr lots of feels about losing my virginity at a relatively young age. Would be interested in hearing similar experiences/advice.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that I'm having difficulty seeing my boyfriend as a result of this, which is perfectly understandable, but impacts me pretty negatively. He's gone through the same thing and he's always been my best friend before my boyfriend, and I'd love to talk to him about it, but I just can't.

I grew up in an abusive home but after high school I managed to move away for college thanks to the help of non-abusive family members. Because of my home situation, I started college continuing to suppress my emotions as I had for years and totally ignoring the possibility of relationships. That worked out pretty well for the first year and a half. I got depressed every so often, sure, but all the things I stressed about were problems with school, and I was free from stressing about relationships. Eventually I started to realize that what I was doing, while beneficial in some ways, wasn't normal and was preventing me from being happy. I knew I had to learn to deal with emotions if I ever wanted to feel like I was living a fulfilling life. 

This is the toughest thing I've ever done. Emotions are so strong, and all of my logical reasoning doesn't do squat to make me feel better. When I suppress them again, I feel wonderful, and free, but I hate myself for it because I know it's a step backwards.

**What happened recently has me eager to curl back up into the safety of suppression and I need some help stopping myself from doing it.**

A few months ago I contacted an old friend on Facebook. After the years we spent together, I moved away from a normal life and into the abusive household I mentioned earlier. I'm now on the other side of the country from where we grew up, and I swear all I intended to do when initially contacting her was to reminisce on our shared memories and catch up to see what kind of people we had become. All of the memories after we parted are things I want to forget, and largely have forgotten due to suppression. But I actually want to remember the things we did together. I can't stress enough how unique that is for me. I spent so long trying to escape from my past, thinking every moment of it was painful, that when I eventually remembered the happier years with her, it was overwhelming. 

We were both busy with college until recently, and only just now got a chance to chat over Skype. Before this, we had talked a bit on Facebook, and actually started texting, but most of our conversations involved figuring out when we would both be available to Skype. During this time, I had no reason to think she didn't want to reminisce about our past. I became happy whenever I heard from her. The happiness was entirely fueled by nostalgia, and I logically knew this, but I told myself that happiness is still happiness even if it's caused my something as pathetic as nostalgia. These emotions, these memories were so damn powerful. The conversation we'd have on Skype was entirely different in my imagination than what actually happened.

She didn't want to reminisce. She barely even talked, I did all the talking. I thought that she would have just as many memories she'd want to bring up as I did. She didn't, there were a few but she talked so little it was the most one sided conversation I've ever had. Now, I talked to her enough before this to know that she's genuinely nice. She really didn't seem to be talking to me out of pity, and I still don't think she was. She was actually the one to suggest we start texting, so if she wanted to stop hearing from me she did a bad job at it. But what she intended to happen in our Skype conversation, and what I intended, were clearly very different. I wanted to catch up, to get to know each other again, to have a friend who was unique in the fact that she didn't remind me of bad memories like all of my other friends from high school do. And technically speaking, that's still doable. She just wasn't as interested in talking about the past as I was. 

I feel absolutely pathetic. What the fuck is wrong with me. I didn't contact her with any sort of romantic intentions in mind, honestly. But somehow what I did feels more pathetic than if I did that. I spent so long trying to run away from my past, and yet I got so caught up in another, happier era of my past that I could barely have a regular conversation with this girl. I felt emotions, caused by powerful happiness inducing memories that she didn't really want to talk about. I realized this is because she, like most more normal people, doesn't have the kind of mental split that I do. It's not common to have happy memories, then painful memories of abuse until adulthood. Why reminisce about childhood memories when all of your good AND bad memories are mixed together in one life, while I feel like I've had three already? Happy childhood with her, teen years being abused, and adulthood, I mean.

I want to just give up on emotions. Again. These emotions were so distracting, for absolutely no payoff. There was no reason to think about the memories as much as I did. She didn't care as much about them as I do. I'm terrified to see what would happen with an actual romantic interest. God, I would be horrible in an actual relationship. I'm a nice guy, I think. I put up a very, very good front that I've worked on for years. Nobody I haven't confided to would know or ever assume this kind of shit is wrong with me. I just... what do I do now? Now that this little experiment in time travel is over? Now that I know how fucking pathetic emotions can make me, someone who can think calmly and logically when his emotions are successfully suppressed? I want to be a normal person, but clearly I'm NOT a normal person when under the influence of emotions, with my currently level of control anyway. I already see a talk therapist. I'll certainly bring this up with her next time I see her. But this happened very recently, and I just need some advice sooner rather than later.

Fast forward 4 years later and she's still the only girl I""ve ever dated, and I'm 25.

Whenever a girl initiates contact, whether it be FB chat, asking to hang out, or meeting up with them...if it was their idea, I get this crazy thoughts in my head like we're going to start dating or some shit. I don't come off this way in person, but it's definitely all I think about

Usually (because it doesnt happen often) after we hang out it's the only thing I can think about for the next couple days. Always analyzing what happened, thinking about my next move.

Truth be told, if girls dont ask me to hang out, I get by just fine day to day, but when I'm talking or being interested in girls I seem to drop all sense of reality and fixate on that one girl.

I understand that the general advice/consensus will just be some generic:
-""Well, don't do that dude""
-""Dude, stop having oneitis, wtf""
etc.

Yes, I know that. I know what I'm feeling and thinking is wrong. It's almost like a mix of desperation and a really distorted sense of false reality, but I can never seem to control thinking that any woman who acts kind or stops to talk to me wants me to be their next husband.

I've never dated or kissed a girl. I've never cared enough to ask girls out on dates. In fact, I never understood the dating culture. My ideal life has always been to be with one person whom you click with, completely and fully.

So far, I haven't found this person but when I do, I'll know it and I'll be ready to give my world to her. All my friends are dating and in relationships to ""try it out"" and ""see if it works out"". I usually almost always can tell why it won't work out between me and some girl I find attractive within an hour or two of talking to her.

The girls that I've ""almost"" been with (or almost hit it off with) told me that I'm not ""aggressive enough"" when it comes to being romantic or intimate. What can I say, I'm just NOT an aggressive person in general. I'm a very calm, collected and relaxed individual. I'd much rather go with the flow than initiate things. I hate confrontation. If some guy is being a dick to me, I'll politely leave and avoid any trouble - this is quite literally the smartest thing to do. However, girls want you to ""man up"" and get in a fight with this dude. How and why does this make any sense? I would never in a million years do this. If there's anything I've learned from girls where it didn't work out, it's that most guys take charge of situations and girls admire that; I'm just not like that. 

So I'm just waiting to find someone who I think it'll work out really well with and go from there. Till then, I'm waiting. Literally everyone I've told this to thinks I'm being way too idealistic and that I just ask out people I find attractive and see where it goes from there. This has never made sense to me and probably never will. Any advice?

Also, the ""Just go for it"" advice has never ever worked for me. I can never get myself to and probably never will. I'm actually really content with being single right now; I've never felt the need to be in a relationship. I'm just happy doing what I want, when I want and how I want.

She also said that she wasn't attracted to me anymore. Personally, I find this hard to believe because she was very sexual and initiated 90% of the time. We always seemed to enjoy ourselves as well and she said it was the most satisfying relationship she's ever been in, sexually speaking. Hell, she was even the first girl I had ever been with too. Needless to say that I was feeling pretty good for a while but all that changed when we broke up. I suddenly felt inadequate. Its difficult to tell if this was true objectively speaking or not. She was definitely more attractive than I am though. I'm in excellent shape, have a pretty defined physique and am probably a lot stronger than most people my size. However, I'm relatively short at 5'7"" and small at 130ish pounds. It doesn't help that my teeth are all fucked up as well. Despite this, I act confident and don't let it get to me, for the most part. Sometimes I feel like I'm just putting on an act though and know that I'm really not all that attractive. Honestly, sometimes I feel like my self esteem is on the brink of collapse. Its never gotten there mainly because I can talk myself into a good mood fairly easily but its still scary. 

I've also been feeling like my life is extremely boring right now as well. I don't really have anything to do. I always tell myself that if I had more money, I'd never be bored. But then I think ""What would I do even if I had money?"" and I can't think of anything except perhaps travel. I can't think of anything to spice my life up at all. I'm actually dreading the summer because I'm afraid of how incredibly bored I'm going to be. It doesn't help either that all of my friends are pretty boring too. We just don't really do anything. I'm in desperate need of hobbies but I can't think of anything to do. 

I'm also beginning to worry if I bore other people. This has always been an insecurity of mine. When me and my girlfriend were together, I always felt like I was responsible for her entertainment. If we weren't doing anything then she must have been bored and it was my fault. I also can't seem to consistently hold interesting conversations with other people. I don't know why. I'm pretty knowledgeable about most subjects so its not because I don't have any opinions or feelings on a topic. 

I'm beginning to ramble but the jist of this is that I need to figure out how to be happy with the person that I am. Sure I can change certain things by lifting or working out but I'll never get taller. I like to think that I could be better at conversation as well. I could, in theory, get my teeth fixed but that's a long way off. 

Has anyone ever felt like this? How do you learn to be happy with yourself?

 I grew up in a poor and absuive family, was bullied heavily in school (even in college!), have very seldom put myself first, can be really naive... I tend to be really, really leniant on others, making a billion excuses for them, but I will tear myself a new asshole over the littlest mistake.

 I'm a perfectionist and am always rushing to do more and more. My life history is filled with moments where I worked myself to exhaustion and I look back on those times and say, ""I should have done more. Why aren't I strong enough!?""

 As a child I was a gifted person... I scored very high on IQ and Emotional IQ tests and in Grade 1 was offered to be put ahead a grade. My mother said no, however, because she was afraid that I would be bullied. What she didn't know, though, is that I was already being bullied and I was lying to her about being popular. What eventually happened was that I would spend my mornings in the Grade 1/2 class doing the Grade 2 curriculum but technically being in Grade 1 and spending my afternoons in the Grade 5/6 class studying English and science and doing crafts. Even back then I was very emotionally fragile (I still am, but I have learned to hide it well) and would cry at the drop of a hat over the smallest social injustice, or if I was bullied, or if something emotionally aroused me too deeply.

 I have a postgraduate degree in my field and literally have a dream job (a job that people oooh and ahhhh and get all sparkly-eyed over when I mention the company and position) but I still feel like an enormous loser.

 People scare me easily. Usually I find myself anticipating the moment that they will reject me and I close up... Whenever I find someone that can get me to be open and have fun I become extremely attached. Recently I developed extremely deep feelings for a guy who was like this but in the end he rejected me.

 I spend a lot of time alone, living in a city where the dating pool is quite poor. I get told that I am attractive constantly but I have a hard time seeing it; all I can see is the little defects in my body that need to be changed. No matter how much I change my body I am always unhappy with it. I'm always too fat, too thin, x body part is the wrong shape, etc. I work out like crazy and range between the low side of average and slightly underweight for my height (and I am quite toned) but my diet is absolute shit... 99% of my diet is coffee, chocolate, fish, yogourt and vegetables (not together, LOL)... I binge eat regularly due to the level of stress that I typically experience.

 In general I experience a lot of shame over my personality. I feel like I am so different from others that I will never find peers who can truly accept me for who I am. In general people get close to me because I can offer them acceptance but they can't do the same for me...

This might be hard to understand for normal people but I have been at peace with this for many years now. My life has been stable, I have had loads of fun, a nice career, just no relationship.

Earlier today I convinced my last single friend to give a great girl a fair chance because I am convinced she might be just what he needs. Tonight he will finally make a move and I know they have a more than fair chance of hitting it off. I can really see them moving in together in only a few weeks or months.

While I am keeping my fingers crossed for them, that would also mean all my friends would be married or in a serious relationship. Great for them, but I have never felt so sad, lonely and scared.

Advice, Reddit?",EnglishMobster,5,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/sjd5h/after_a_short_time_in_a_relationship_i_get/,"* This is a sort-of update to the [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/shk8j/a_girl_whos_been_in_nearly_nonstop_contact_with/) I made yesterday that I learned after I got home today never got posted because I didn't post it to the right subreddit (sorry, mods!).

Alright, a little bit of backstory. I'm 18 (M), and my first romantic relationship was with a super-possessive bipolar girl a few years back. 

She was very passionate and forward with her advances, and so when we finally broke up (I was never very happy in the relationship but hesitated in ending it because she threatened to commit suicide if I ever did), I sort of thought a headstrong attitude towards things was normal.

Because of this, I never really learned the appropriate way to do things; although I never took things *terribly* far (I'm still a virgin), but I would do things like playfully poke a girl I was seeing in the boob thinking it was normal.

This sort of thing helped to ruin what was probably the best relationship I ever had, and so I thought I learned my lesson.

Now let's get down to the story.

Just before spring break, I met a girl. She's 22 (almost 23) and goes to the same community college as I do. There's a bit of an age difference, and I've never had any kind of serious interaction with a female non-family member who was much more than a year older than me.

We met at the school library and really hit it off. I was in a relationship at the time, so I felt guilty for feeling attracted to her. However, shortly afterward my then-girlfriend broke up with me due to a bunch of stress she was going through (her dad, a police officer, was shot and killed in the line of duty around Thanksgiving and she said she couldn't handle the stress of a relationship on top of all the other fallout she was dealing with).

I came back from spring break no longer having to bear the guilt of possible infidelity (something I had promised myself never to do after my parents divorced) and wound up having an 8-hour impromptu date the day afterward. We were in almost constant contact for the next week, as she would keep messaging me until 2-3 AM, and we could literally spend hours just sitting there and talking. Even though we only spent about a week together, it felt like much longer.

I was still a bit awkward when it came to relationships. I told her I liked her almost right away, she said that a. I wasn't supposed to just **tell** someone that, and b. she needed some time to get to know me better before she made that judgement.

On our second real date, I made the mistake of giving her an awkward kiss on the cheek. Later, I got this text:

&gt;Just so you know, I'm not offended by the kiss on the cheek. Yes, it was awkward and caught me off-guard. But I think we both need time. I have a lot of fun with you, but I think we need to have time to start as friends. Don't rush things blindly. You're still young. You have much to learn.

Then we proceed to have another date at the movie theater, which went off fairly awkwardly because I felt I was treading on thin ice and didn't want to make anything worse.

It would seem that afterward her best friend (whom I've never met) talked with her and convinced her afterward to give me another chance. We picked ourselves back up where we had left off and had lots of fun together again.

We continued to hang out all the time, and yesterday after class I walked her to her car, and we both sat down and started talking. She poked me once, and so I poked her back, and pretty soon she was trying to tickle me and I was trying to tickle her and we wound up wrestling with one another in her car.

Eventually, I had her pinned and so she bit me (playfully), and so I wound up trying to retaliate (with little success) until finally after 4 hours we were both tired and sweaty and called it even.

When I got home, I received a text saying that she was going to stop poking me and goofing off in general because ""it wasn't something that friends do.""

The ""friend"" word caught me a bit off-guard; I knew she said she had wanted to wait, so I hadn't kissed her or anything, but it threw up some red flags. I texted her about it, but her replies suddenly became spotty and short. I asked if she was alright, and she said that she ""doesn't reply to every text,"" something that had never been a problem before.

I saw her today, and when I sat down she immediately scooted about a foot away.

Apparently, over the course of our roughhousing the day before, she had gotten a bruise on her arm and said that I caused it. She said that I had ***scared*** her yesterday and that she was canceling the date we had scheduled for Saturday because she wanted some personal space. She wasn't waiting for me after class like she normally was, and she told me not to wait for her anymore, either.

I've never been the strongest guy around. In fact, I lose at pretty much any kind of wrestling matches or anything, at least among other guys. I'm not overweight or anything, either (I'm 6 feet tall [~2 meters] and my BMI is ~~1~~ 23, I must've been looking at the wrong thing).

Giving someone a bruise and scaring them is a bit of a shock for me, both because I didn't think I could cause that kind of damage to anyone, accidentally or otherwise, and because I swore to myself I would never become that type of guy. I never once hit her, but the shock of seeing that *my* actions led to her getting a bruise (on her wrist) and her saying she was scared to just be around me nearly led to me posting on [/r/SuicideWatch](/r/SuicideWatch) if an old friend whom I hadn't talked to in ages hadn't managed to calm me down.

She knows it wasn't on purpose, and she says she bruises easily, but she also told me I don't know my own strength. I was caught up in the moment, but now I'm scared because this was the first time I've ever had someone become legitimately *afraid* of me due to my actions. She had told me she really liked me just before it happened, and now I'm scared that I've gone and fucked up everything.

I've decided to give her space and time to think. I don't see her until Tuesday (at the time of writing, it is a Thursday night/Friday morning). She hasn't replied to any of my texts since she said good-bye earlier, so I doubt she's going to come around anytime soon.

I've told myself I'm not going to text her anymore until she initiates the conversation, because I'm the kind of guy that gets clingy and talkative and won't shut up, sort of like when you hit the ""A"" button too many times when trying to get your Pokemon healed and wind up having to go through a lengthy conversation with Nurse Joy again (I'm trying to work on this as well, to no avail).

I need help, Reddit.

I've been abused and picked on all my life, and never once have I ever wanted to do the same to anyone else. I've always been dominated by my emotions and the moment, doing dumb things like giving someone an unwanted kiss even though every brain cell in my head was telling me not to, or taking things farther than I ever intended. I **never** want to do it again. I **never** want to have this happen to me again.

Giving her space is the only thing I can think of that I can do, even though she was the only person who was willing to talk to me on a regular basis (my best friend whom I normally talk to when I have nowhere else to turn has been a complete asshole to me recently). So my questions are twofold:

1. **Can anything be done to salvage our relationship?** I really liked her, but now I'm scared that I've ruined everything. I've apologized profusely, but she's made indications that she's not looking for a romantic relationship. I'm fairly certain nothing more can be done about this other than giving her the space and time to think things over (and maybe her friend will come to my side again, although since I've actually caused physical harm I doubt it).

2. **Can I do anything to keep this from happening again?** I never want to do this to anyone. I *don't* want to be that kind of guy. Being 18, I still rely upon my parents for medical checkups and such, so while I'm not adverse to the idea of seeing a psychologist, a combination of bouncing between 2 houses, a full schedule at school, and a job leaves me with very little time to seek out any therapy sessions. I used to see a psychologist back when I was with the possessive bi-polar girl I mentioned at the start of my post, and I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and co-dependency. Outside of medication, is there any way I can make sure this *never* happens again?

**tl;dr: I apparently bruised and scared a girl yesterday by accidentally going too far in a wrestling match. I need help to make sure I never scare anyone again.** I don't think I could handle it.

I graduated from college a year ago and my happiness has declined drastically since. I have been actively looking for work in my field (forensic science) since last April and have had zero luck.  Very few places are hiring entry level positions and even those require 1-3 years experience.    
    
Until then I am stuck in a job I hate where I am underpaid/overqualified/not-respected/miserable. I can't even find full-time jobs outside my field that are hiring. I don't make enough money to move out of my parents house. My love life is non-existent, I thought after getting out of college finding girlfriends would be easier (forever alone).      
  
I have struggled with depression before and I feel like it may be coming back. I try to tell myself that I am over-reacting and that other people have it worse than me but sometimes I can't help but feel like the universe is conspiring against me.

I got in and out of the dealership pretty quick so that was even better, then on my way home I get in a 5-car accident and total my car, FML.        
  
Sorry if it sounds like I am whining I just wanted to get that off my chest. After that car accident today I really feel like shit, now I have to get a ride from my co-worker to my shitty job until I get a new car.

I (m25) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (28) for over 3 years. We had ups and downs but throughout the last year I am getting more and more concerns about spending the rest of my life with her. For the last few months we have had a long distance relationship because of work but will both move to the same town again this summer to go back to school. To make things worse I have met someone at work (f28) who I really like. We get lunch together every day (along with a couple of other people) but also have dinner together 3-4 times a week (only us two) and also go to the movies/museums. I don't know if she feels the same way, she seems to be pretty shy. I feel really bad about having a crush on her and having a girlfriend who I still love. Also she will move away in a few weeks anyway. But I have the feeling I'm missing a chance...

My girlfriend has also had a hard time for the past few years which also gets us into fights quite often. But I'm to scared to end our relationship because I had the best time of my live with her and probably would crush her feelings/live.

Some facts about me:

- I haven't had a girlfriend in 13 years. 
- I haven't had sex in 14 years. 
- I currently live in someone's garage, it's uncomfortable and depressing. 
- I have enough money to buy a nice house and a new car. 
- I am apathetic to my job. It's very boring, but stress free and no one bothers me. I spend most of my time surfing the internet and get paid for it. 
- It is my 5th job in 4 years. I bounce around a lot. 
- I have lived in this area for over 20 years. I feel like I need a change of scenery, and I have bad memories here. Spending the rest of my life here is unappealing, but I realize that the area is not the problem: The problem is me.  
- I have no family (parents, siblings, etc) alive. 
- I am having trouble embracing life and finding happiness. 

Okay, now that you know a little about me, let me tell you what I am facing: I have the opportunity to live overseas. It is in a third-world country, and I can't imagine that I will spend the rest of my life there. Maybe one of two years, but who knows? Then I will move somewhere else. I love to travel. I have been wanting to live overseas for decades. I fantasized about it for a long time. It sounds adventurous. I can learn a new language, meet new people, and feel good about helping the poor. I would be fulfilling a dream. 

On the other hand, I wonder if this is another diversion to avoid facing self-improvement. I am tired of not having a girlfriend. I have been dating recently, but women can tell that I have trouble enjoying life. Living in someone's garage is a big clue. Plus, I am a little worried about quitting another job. My resume doesn't look good going from one job to another. What do you think I should do? Go overseas and have fun or stay and get a house and work on finding a woman? I am 35 and I really want to get married and have kids one day. I feel like I have been stuck for years and life has been passing me by.

How can I cope better?,spikeydogcollar,6,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/s6l4c/so_of_7_years_and_i_have_different_priorities_on/,"Okay, so boyfriend and I (both 25 in a heterosexual relationship) have been together for 7 years. We've been engaged once, but there were a number of issues that caused it to fail. When we started dating, I didn't pull any punches and told him that within 5 years I really pictured myself working with animals, married, and starting a family, while he pulled the typical 18-year-old guy response: big house, job working on race cars, degree. No mention of a family or even a wife. Over the years I dropped out of college and worked so he could pursue his college career. After seven years he's finally landed a job other than a gas station job that he enjoys and pays $14/hour. I quit my job in January to spend more time on school and volunteer at the zoo to qualify for the experience every job requires you have before hire. I really don't want to go back to school because I always figured that once boyfriend got his job we'd get married and start a family and frankly school and kids don't mix for the most part. I realize that it's hard for us to support ourselves right now and that a family would strain it even further, but I can't even mention it without him getting angry and telling me that I'd be ruining my schooling and (basically) my life. Honestly I feel like schooling is just something to pass time until we can start a family, but it's obviously more important to him that I finish school and get established in my field first. Doing this will put me near 30, the age when congenital birth defects begin to skyrocket with every passing year until conception. I know that's still five years away, but I can't help but worry that by the time he's finally ready (if he ever is), it would be too risky for me. He constantly talks about all this expensive stuff that he wants (guns, cars, cameras, constant traveling which I don't want) and wants us to move into a house with roommates (which I'm not that comfortable with) and it makes me feel like he doesn't even want kids even though whenever I bring it up he says he does. I currently live with my parents (free board for school) who do not like him in any way. I'm getting worried and depressed thinking about all of this and I really need some ideas to help me cope better. Any suggestions?

TL;DR: Boyfriend of seven years doesn't appear to want kids until I'm so old it seems dangerous, need coping advice.

Edit: Thank you for your advice. It appears I have a very difficult discussion in my future.

Another Edit: Up until last year I was the breadwinner of our relationship. While he was in school and worked three days a week I regularly put in 40+ hours a week at a commission-paying job. I have no problem going back to work, even if it would be at a crappy entry-level or retail job, if we could make it work. I don't want anyone thinking I want nothing more than to be a baby machine who can't fend for myself.

I realized that the reason I cannot have a good relationship with the man I am in love with is because I am so afraid he will not love me for who I am that I force myself to never, ever put up a fight or take issue with anything, ask for anything, make a stand about anything because ultimately I worry he'll up and leave me; as though I cannot understand why he would ever be with me. What do I offer? I simply turn into a needy blob, calling, texting, whining and catering. It's interesting, because I can see our relationship developing positively whenever I feel more confident, and yet I cannot stop acting like a silly, needy girl. I want to call him right now and tell him how I feel but something is stopping me: fear. Fear of his judgement. Fear that he won't care, that he'll think it's silly, that I'll sound irrational.

My father made me believe that no man would ever love me. Really. He has called me ugly, fat, stupid, mean, useless, pathetic... you name it. The way he treated me, the way he treats my grandmother, and the way he has treated all the women in his life to date (including my mother) has taught me that women are lessors and deserve to be treated as such. My father is an insecure misogynist, prone to violence and irrationality.


It has almost been a year since I last spoke to him. Our relationship came to a violent climax and since then I have refused to acknowledge him or keep any contact with him, to my benefit. My quality of life has increased greatly since. I was also going to see a therapist for about three or four months, which had a very positive effect as well.


I want to feel like myself again. I want to passionately be in love with my boyfriend like I was a few months ago, and to unabashedly tell him how I feel and what he means to me. I want to be able to stand up for myself and communicate efficiently. But I cannot shake this subconscious insecurity over males. When I really like someone, I end up catering to them hand and foot because, well, I have such a low self-esteem that I can't imagine why they would ever be with me.


I am told I am very attractive... I used to be very passionate about politics, the environment, art, design, writing, but somewhere down the line I just lost it. I miss it. I miss having passionate interests.


I'm really sorry about the sporadic tone of this post, I'm feeling incredibly depressed and a lot is floating around in my head.

The driving thing is literally making me feel worthless and completely useless.

I think I have pretty decent social skills. I smile, I try to be friendly, I can chit chat with strangers on the fly, and I generally try to be polite.


But something is driving me crazy. I always seem to have a horrible sense of timing, that or people aren't really interested in hearing what I have to say. 


For example: I often find myself in a situation where I'm with a group of people who are talking about something and I have something relevant to say. Naturally I listen to the people speaking and wait till they finish expressing a complete idea and then I try to chime in. It's right then that other people will start talking right over me. I usually end up just shutting up. I figure that I'm not wanted in the conversation, or that my value in the pack, as it were, is very low.


Second example, and this is perhaps more common: I will be with a group just as in the above described example, but when I try to chime in, something happens. Either the commercial will end and the show will come back on, or we'll pull into a gas station and everyone gets out, or someone else will walk up and join the group, causing everyone to stop listening to me in order to greet the new person.


Third example: I was on a podcast once with some friends. There were four of us. I was pretty quiet during the podcast as I either didn't get a chance to say anything, or I was waiting till I thought I had something worth while to contribute. Towards the end of the podcast the host asked on final question and we went around the table answering. The other two people took up a lot of time and we were already running over. After they were done that acted like everything was over and started to pack up. The host then remembered that I had not been able to give any input and asked me to say what I thought. One of the other people in the podcast looked at the host and said ""Really?"" And then just rolled his eyes in a ""welp, whatever..."" fashion when I began to chime in.


It just really hurts me. I know when I'm not wanted, and I **do not** interject myself into other people's conversations. That's rude and symptomatic of ""that guy."" I feel like I'm just ridiculously low on the social totem pole, despite being intelligent, empathetic, and caring. It just absolutely destroys any sense of self worth that I have.


It really came out this weekend when I took a trip with some friends. There were 4 of us in the car and yet almost the entire conversation was a triangle. I just sat there in my little corner thinking ""I'm not invited to this conversation.""

We've been dating a year.

Now, I love her, and do want to be with her forever. But for some reason, I just feel terribly insecure about everything. I sometimes feel I'm not good enough for her, and sometimes I feel like she'd rather have another guy rather than me.

It causes me great pain to think like that, so then I start doing irrational things. I went through old texts on her phone around the time we started getting official. There was a guy she used to send pictures to, and he'd send them back, but they never even actually met. I'm actually her first boyfriend, and while she's not my first girlfriend, she's the first girl I've done anything sexual with.

I just saw that early in the relationship (say, 5, 6 days after we started) we got in a fight together. The other guy tried to pull the real jerk card, saying ""Most guys are assholes,"", etc. I'd be a liar if I didn't try that with a female friend as well. But he then said to her ""I'd still totally do you, I guess the feeling isn't mutual."" Then she replied ""Maybe so, haha."" 

The next day he tries to initiate a sext or something with her, saying ""I'd like to suck on your boobs"" and she replies with ""Well, considering I have a boyfriend, probably not."" He then asked ""Oh, well, everything's better with him then?"" To which she replied ""Yeah, just the distance is annoying."" After that, the guy never texted her again, but was friends on facebook after that.

She kept the guy as a friend on facebook because he needed someone to tell issues to, which my girlfriend is great for, because she takes the time to listen. But I wasn't comfortable with the guy learning more about the past between them, so she went ahead and deleted him. But it made me feel like a villain, although that's honestly something I think will help with me, considering the circumstances.

There are other things that bug me as well, because the guy for one, had a bigger penis than me, but she says mine is the nicest she's ever seen. Another thing, not related, but she says she'd have a threesome outside of a relationship, which made me nervous that since we've been in a relationship for so long, maybe I was keeping her from experiencing things she'd like to try, but I'm not comfortable with the idea of a threesome. She said that's totally fine, because she'd never want that in a relationship anyway, just because she'd feel jealous as well.

I just need to know if I should feel insecure. Sure, the stuff with the other guy was at the beginning of our relationship after we were ""facebook official"", but we'd only been seeing each other for 6 days or so. We'd been on a date or two, kissed once, and then we were official. But maybe I feel insecure because of a few reasons: 1) When we really went on our first date, I stopped looking around at other girls because I really enjoyed the time I spent with her. And 2) I've had an ex cheat on me before, and it's ruined my trust. I was 17 at the time, but it still hurt pretty bad.

Maybe I feel insecure because of my own self-esteem issues? I'm not in the best of shape, but my girlfriend thinks I'm extremely handsome anyway. Is it what happened to me in the past? I dunno. Is it because it's long distance currently? We're from the same town, but she goes to school 100 miles away. Do I feel like I don't stack up to this other guy or something? I just feel like I'm dwelling on something I shouldn't because there's no one I love more than her in the world.

EDIT: Also, I was trying to post pictures to a blog I run, and ended up finding pictures she sent to people before we dated, although one was dated around the time we had one date. That made me feel a bit insecure too, but I don't think I should even worry considering we'd only really just rekindled a friendship at that point. Just an addition.

r/ihaveissues, what is wrong with me?

TL;DR- Girlfriend used to send pics to a dude before we dated. I've seen a pic or two she's sent from before we dated, and I saw on her texts when we became official a text where she said maybe she's still do him after he said he'd do her, but we'd only been official for 6 days at that point. Dude has bigger peen than me, but she says mine is the nicest she's ever seen. After that, she stopped the guy when he tried to get explicit. I have my own self-esteem issues from being overweight. I'm also her first boyfriend, she's my third, but only one I've done anything sexual with. I've been cheated on before, and it's given me trust issues. Currently semi-long distance, but we talk constantly and I see her almost every weekend. What's wrong with me?

",isuckatlifehard,5,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/r5tnb/26f_i_didnt_come_home_last_night_dont_know_how_to/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for eight years, dating for 2 and living together for 6.  There have been a lot of ups and downs, but for the most part we are and have been very much in love.  However, I have been having some problems with alcohol.

The last 4 times I have gone drinking, I have gotten EXTREMELY drunk to the point of having a ""black out"" where I don't remember anything for large chunks.  One of these times, I was out with out of town friends and stayed out all night.  My boyfriend knew I was with them, but I didn't call him between 9 to 4 a.m. and he was VERY angry.  After this happened, I promised never to do this again, and I meant it.  

There was a period of time about 2 years ago where we were having issues and I engaged in this sort of behavior--I would go out and stay out late and not call him.  It caused a lot of problems, but we worked things through.  I'm ashamed of this behavior and also know I have some issues with drinking, as I tend to binge.  

Well, last night I went to get a drink after work because I was upset about some office stuff.  I went to a bar by my office and had a couple of drinks, and then realized my phone was dead.  I decided to walk to the subway and go home to my boyfriend, but on the way there was a bar nearby I had wanted to check out, so I stopped for another drink quickly.  

You probably realize what happened--a drink turned to two.  I started talking to a couple of ladies at the bar and the bartender bought me a buy-back.  That's all I remember until I woke up on the floor of the two ladies' hotel room at 7 a.m. this morning. 

Thank goodness I was fully dressed and they were nice enough to let me crash.  Apparently I was very inebriated and they took me to their nearby hotel for me to sleep it off.  But I don't remember ANYTHING.  Nothing after that buy-back.  I booked it out of the room and headed home.  I tried to call my boyfriend on the cabbie's cell, but he did not pick up.  He also didn't leave any voicemails.  

Needless to say, my boyfriend is VERY upset.  I haven't actually spoken to him all day and we have been communicating via Gchat, as my phone is still dead and he has the charger.  I'm so terrified that he is going to leave me and I don't know what to say or do.  I know he suspects that I did something other than just get embarrassingly drunk and black out, but I don't know if anything I say can convince him otherwise.  I PROMISED that this wouldn't happen ever again, and it did, not even a month later.  He feels that I am showing him that I don't think of him and that I don't care, which is untrue, but I can see how my behavior would lend itself to that conclusion. 

Is there any hope here?  How do I show him that I'm willing to change and that this WILL NOT EVER HAPPEN AGAIN?? I can imagine how upset he must have been last night, waiting for me to come home and totally incommunicado.  I am a shit head. 

I love him so much and thought we would spend the rest of our lives together.  After 8 years, I am devastated that this will be over because of my idiotic behavior.  

I'm really upset and sad and preparing for the worst.  He hasn't come home, I have a feeling he's out getting drunk himself, and I don't know what to do when he does come home.

Like many others here, I have never had a girlfriend before. ",pissingpolitely,9,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/r3xwb/16m_im_overly_sensitive_depressed_ugly_anxious/,"I'm 16 and a junior in high school now, and this story really starts out in 5th grade. I have depression, anxiety and OCD (I think. I'm too scared to bring that up to a psychiatrist , and I was too ashamed to tell this story I'm about to tell. My OCD was really bad when I was like 7/8 and my parents got divorced. I had a weird feeling that they and my sister were going to die all the time, so I'd say ""Love you very much"" even if they were leaving for like 10 minutes or that they were the ""best (x family member) ever"" ;and I would wash my hands constantly to get the thought of something bad happening to them out of my system.)



Anyway, back to my story.
So In 5th grade, I had my two best friends. Let's call them Mike and James for this story (Again, even typing this I feel like I have to select names carefully, to protect people I know by these names. Weird, I know, but  it was horrible when I was younger) So, Mike had a weird disorder/problem where he would cry A LOT over nothing. Very little things that are insignificant. He's been very good recently; doesn't cry at all now, but he has hurt himself and does deal with depression, I think. James is like an average kid, kind of a tech nerd. He was unpopular however. In 5th grade, I started being friends with a kid named Edwin (who would later sell me out; in 8th grade he spreaded horrible rumors about me, after we got into a fight. He even brought his parents into the office, and made me bring mine. He tried to humiliate me as much as possible. Although reflecting now, I deserved it) Edwin didn't like Mike or James, and we would make fun of them behind their back, and rarely to them. This went on until the middle of 8th grade, when I realized what an asshole I was being. I guess because they were my friends I thought I could take advantage of them like that.

Now here is the horrible part, that has made me consider suicide for the past couple of years; opting not to kill myself, only because my mom who lives with me; who was devastated after the divorce would be devastated even more.
When I was 12 and once when I was 13 (7th grade and once in 8th) I touched my friends, in places and ways that shouldn't be (sexually). I did this to Mike's sister and James. I didn't touch their penis or vagina, but I touched other places. The most sickening part: I did it under the guise of sort of a ""game"" or me ""messing around"" It went on for a while until I got a hold of myself. This is the worst thing I have EVER done. I hate my fucking self for it. I've tried to be as good a friend as I could be to James, and I've tried to be really nice to Mike's sister, when my friends have called her annoying or made fun of her (including Mike) I won't join in, because laughing about someone who you sexually abused is NOT something I would ever do. People think it's weird that I defend her and stuff, and not just joke along; but I feel like it's the least I can do.

Here's what makes it even worse:
Every year, I go to California and visit my family, including my Aunt who I got really close to a couple of years ago. Whenever I go to California, the nice weather lifts my depression, and I feel so nice. My surroundings and the weather really impact my mood, which is another reason why I might be the depressed person I am) I talk to her about things on my mind; except for this story and you'll see why.
My aunt has bipolar disorder. When she has her episodes, they are really severe. I found out like 2 years ago that he was molested/sexually abused when she was like 7 or 8, by an older kid in the neighborhood (probably 12 or 13) (By the way: James and Mike are my age, and Mike's sister is about 2 years younger) When she was older (not sure how old, or where this happened; but I figured out from my dad and cousin) my aunt was raped. I think this may have sparked her bipolar episodes later, and it must have really hurt her) When she had bipolar episodes, she told me that her feeling of hatred and likeness of people are magnified greatly. These two women took advantage of her so much. They acted like her friends and used her feelings of friendship for them. and because of my aunt's amazing generocity, made her buy RIDICULOUS amounts of stuff for them. One woman hit on her all the time, and tried to make her feel a sexual attraction to her. These two women were evil, but were notable public figures in the town where they all live. When my aunt realized what they were doing, she told them how she needed time for herself, and that she couldn't be around them for a while. These two women were mad (because my aunt poured out her love and money; but mostly money to them) and spread horrible rumors about her, made her look like an insane freak and turned almost everyone in the town against her. They did evil things to her, and I'm so sad that my aunt has ran into so many pure evil people in my life

I feel like these people that did this to my aunt; and I hate myself for it. I talked shit about my friends, and I did things to them that shouldn't have happened. I've tried to be as good a friend as I possibly can, but I feel like it doesn't make up. What if one of my friends gets a mental disorder sparked because of me? What if their lives are ruined because of me? What if they think it's their fault?
I told my friends ""Sorry if I've ever done anything to hurt you"" because I'm ashamed but all they've siad is ""It's fine"" or ""I can't remember anything you did""
Am I betraying my aunt, because I talk to her? Am I one of those evil people that hurt her? I bet she would hate me if she knew what I did to my friends.

My friends and acquaintances call me nice. Lots of people call me sweet and think I'm the kind of person who wouldn't hurt a fly. My parents and my aunt that I mentioned earlier think I'm the most innocent, sweet, sensitive person ever. People I don't even know that well call me a nice person. A girl randomly called me a sweetheart in class for no reason. I guess I look like a nice person, and I probably act like one too. The only truth in all of that is that I'm sensitive and that I wouldn't hurt a fly (at least I wouldn't intentionally anymore)
I feel like I'm lying to all these people because of their opinion of me. They don't know the darker side of my life and I HATE MYSELF FOR IT SO MUCH. My past haunts me all the time.
I my friends have a shitty life all because of me, I really might just fucking pull the trigger.
Not to mention in 6th grade I made fun of this girl, who many other kids made fun of for being mentally challenged (not retarded or anything, just kind of slow)
Also, about the things I did to my friends: If I see an object that I was on when this happened (a piece of furniture) or anything from that year (late 2007-2008) I feel a strong desire to wash my hands, or whatever touched that object. If it touched the floor, and the floor has not been washed, I will walk around that spot. I'm even hesitant to watch youtube videos from that time period. What does this mean?


I'm afraid to have a girlfriend because I'm extremely sensitive. I don't want to date someone just to fuck them. I want to have a relationship with someone who I really connect to, and can pour my heart out to, and they can pour their heart to me, and we can love eachother. I'm deeply afraid of getting my heart broken. I'll be hesitant in the relarionship, because I don't want someone who knows everything about me to just leave me. I know I'll be the heartbroken, not the heartbreaker.

This isn't right anymore. And I can't handle these shit emotions. (And English isn't really my native language).


Lets see if this post will get on decently... Long!


Anyway, onwards. In front of you is a young man, aged 29, male, decent looking, bit of a posture problem but whatever. He never had a relationship and is a virgin and ~~terribly~~ shy to boot. Was interested in a woman who sent mixed signals and is terribly happy not to have made a decent move on her. God, what a bombshell dodged. Afterwards I really wonder if she really was interested or was just playing with me ...


Synopsis, chronologically:

* Since young it felt like a wall was in front of me, dulling emotions
* Never learned to make deep/true connections to people
* Never learned to try to cross borders (protective parents!!)
* Somehow managed to have a few friends in the lower-grade school, declined in high school, never had meaningful friendships since
* As a result, never learned to socialize properly
* Moreover, the shyness really was crippling (still is for a bit), doesn't make any sense at all
* After that found a job I love(?), but there were things ""off"", didn't make sense I couldn't make contact decently
* I have a room over there in which I used to sleep/eat/?? during the week, weekends spent at parents
* Worked there for a year, afterwards went to a psychiatrist (P1) for trying to see if I could get help regarding contacts
* At this psychiatrist (P1) I was tested for autism, pdd-nos concluded, subscribed me to the adult autism team with a large waiting list (at that moment I though ""Whatever, oh well, couldn't hurt, I guess""). Disbelief for me.
* I began to feel a pressure about two years later on the chest (like a bit of a fight to hold shit in).
* Meanwhile went on a vacation (October 2011, first vacation ever alone, group with same minded persons though, to the USA) on which I had a crush on a female, I think she liked me too but for now that doesn't matter because she is ~~a bigger idiot than I thought~~ at most a friend, I found that out two hours ago, doesn't even feel that bad so I guess it was insecurity speaking here all the time ;)
* Anyway, pressure increased until December last year when all emotions went out (laid down in bed at 22:00, endured until 04:00), felt like a wreck the day after, this happened about three times. Also during the day, at which I decided to return to my parents.
* This happened about 5/6 times more in January, including bouts of a brain that literally was overloaded (psychiatrist P2) (terrible pain in the brain, duration about 30 minutes, two hours to recuperate), felt afterwards like I woke up from a deep sleep. Haven't had those this month thank some agnostic deity!
* Since then I literally feel shaky (at times) and can't handle all this feelings, this seems to happen after socializing much (fuck, why?!). This doesn't make any sense at all.
* Right now they plan to get me a psychologist, a psychiatrist (P3 that will be) and group therapy. I may take medicine to get my brain to calm down since this isn't right.
* And there I am, wide awake thinking what is wrong with me, how to fix this shit and the dreaded ""is it too late?"" thoughts (and the dawning that I indeed may have autism doesn't help either).


By the way, still working for the same company, for a little more than 4 years, since begin this year I am ill, starting to work slowly once again but my brain keeps getting distracted.


It doesn't make any sense at all that I don't go out there and do shit for once! **Damn it**. I want to do so many things but this terrible brain doesn't help at all! I want to live damn it! Have fun, maybe fuck around a bit (virgin here) and see what happens after, who cares anyway! Fuck, I don't even know if I am hetero or maybe bi.


And laugh about that silly crush on that woman (situation she is in is fucked up now but oh well, I really have to think if I can only see her as a friend or if I have to move on and forget about her -&gt; god, you blasted, stupid, stupid, woman, bah)

I don't want to betray anyone or imply anything that is untrue, as well as give away information that is not necessarily important, so I am leaving out a LOT of what you consider ""juicy"" or required (but may divulge specific information if asked). I feel that a brief background (of me) may help you, and if not, I can remove it via edit or post deletion. Furthermore, if this post is in the wrong subreddit, please let me know.

I am a very closed-off person who thinks an incredible amount about every situation, is always racing different thoughts, and perhaps seeking perfection. This last point is becoming less of who I am, but definitely contributed/defined who I am. I am young (21) and realize I have a lot of life to look forward to, but my outlook on life is quite different than most and my approach is definitely in a minority.

I am extremely poor at conversing with people (and avoid it) because I receive no stimulation from chatting. For this reason, I have few friends and feel that I irritate them for always wanting to delve very deeply into topics. I could probably be considered a romantic towards all aspects of life.

I have recently become close friends with a girl who is in a long relationship. She has opened the world to me and I sincerely appreciate that (there is no cheating involved or condoned; talking and certain experiences have caused this). However, we talk about very individual and emotional topics, which has caused us to become closer. On another level, there is definitely attraction between us, but both of us know what is at stake and merely converse about what could have happened. Self-control is key on both sides.

She has earned my heart, and I am unsure of what to do. I only say she has my heart because this is very true and is meant directly as stated. It is not doting or puppy love, but a definite connection (again I can not say more unfortunately). I would love to date her, but know I would not be able to live up to what she expects or needs even though I'd be willing to try (this is not the purpose of this post).

This girl has become a great part of my life whether or not she knows it. I don't want to steal her; in fact, I just want to maintain a healthy relationship with her as I fear I am turning her away. I'm not wholly sure why, but I just feel doubt. This is very troubling for me, as it is shaking my core. I have gained new understandings and appreciations toward life, but am confused because this is the way I would view the heart talking purely and have never experienced this before.

In terms of a relationship (and as someone who is very unfamiliar with them), I worry that I will never find someone like her. She is the most graceful, beautiful, amazing person I know, and needs to know this.

Important, baited questions: How do you compete with raw emotion, especially if you have never felt it before?

How should I expect to ever find someone of her calibre?

Before you dismiss this based on age, lack of experience, or any other cliche response (as I feel they are not applicable), I would like to restate that my feelings are genuine and the very definition of emotion. I do not know how to convey this to you as it is ineffable, but I have tried. I'm aware this is shittily written/vague, but can clarify things as needed. I feel like talking, so I hope I can entertain/challenge your perspectives as well as mine. Respond truthfully.

I have never met someone so perfect for me and I love him. I do however have problems of my own. 

I feel sexually frustrated for reasons I'm still trying to fully understand, although the source is probably obvious. When I was about 6, my half brother and I would play these 'games'. It wasn't gruesome, no penetration; it happened maybe 3-5 times and I stood up to him saying I would tell. When I was 15, I was acting out (hormones, mother leaving) causing my dad and stepmom to go through my room. They found things I'd written that strongly implied what had happened all those years ago. Long story short, my brother is a registered sex offender. This was just so long ago that it happened. Me and him didn't talk for a long time, and now we do. He is married and has 2 kids and his wife knows about this shameful part of our past, obviously. **Sexual molestation at age 6 by brother age 13, resolved legally**      

My SO has met my brother once so far and they really hit it off. I want to tell my SO about this, because a) I think it effects our sex life as he likes when the female initiates but I have only done so a few times, and I just feel insecure in general and b) because I'm thinking about it. Idk, I guess I just want to share it with him to feel relief, and closer to him. But I don't know how he will feel about my brother and I don't want to create tension between them. I have fully forgiven my brother, I love him and there's no changing what's been done. **I want SO and brother (friend) to cont. getting along, but feel like I need to tell him of the past** 

Also, the last long term 'relationship' I was in would take too long to explain but essentially sex was the only aspect of it. At first I didn't realize this was the case, but when I did and got over the anger of it I accepted his ritual begging and let him use me. At first it was low self esteem and then it was just a fuck it kind of attitude, because he was good for that. This 'begging' became harassment and I ended up getting a protection order a few months before me and my SO were together. **Ex from 2 years ago used me for sex, I let him therefore making it ok in my mind for sex to be the only way of showing attraction**

When I met my SO it was the week after my sister died. She was my best friend and the whole situation was so stressful as she was my room mate and I had to make a hasty decision to move me and my 3 cats into one room. I've been an emotional wreck because of this ordeal, I don't even think I've fully accepted her death. So much shit has happened (I got sued for a small accident that wasn't my fault, purse stolen, dealing with legal reminders in the mail of my ex - they kept me updated). **It's been a rough fucking year.**  

I feel like I met him at the worst time of my life. In the beginning I thought he was just trying to be nice to the obviously angry girl, but it blossomed slowly into me caring about him. I could have done it on my own but he snapped me back into reality by simply being the amazing gentleman he is. He reminded me that I still can care about anything.  He says he understands my issues and I think it's fair enough that he has to 'put up' with me whenever the random hell I feel sad or apathetic because he knows what he's getting into. However, the sex thing is unfair no matter what he says. In 6 months I've brought it up maybe 4 times, and 4 times too many. I tell him he needs to make more effort, but the thing is he's perfect. How confusing is that message? It's not fair to him at all. He doesn't care about fucking, he cares about an emotional connection, and I love this. But when I'm insecure I interpret it as he doesn't think I'm attractive. I've told him that I learned this logic from staying with the ex, but it's just an excuse to me. **I need to make more of an effort in sex (ie I want it, I get it myself for once). I'm not being fair. And I think the more deep seeded issue here is the childhood. It may have not been a horror story, but it messed up my psyche.** 

I've ranted, I apologize. I know the rules say to make it easily understood, and I'm sure this is confusing. I needed to get that out. This could probably go in a different subreddit, but this is my first post and I thought this was appropriate. Any advice or whatnot from anyone in similar situations to mine would be appreciated, but the point was...
**How and when if ever should I tell the SO about my childhood? If it were you learning this about your SO would you still feel comfortable around the brother? Do you think I'm creating extra drama when it's entirely unnecessary?** I ask that because I am dealing with a lot, and I wonder if I'm thinking clearly or just being dramatic. I'm happy a lot, more than I thought I ever could be, but sometimes I feel like a giant toddler. I feel I should also mention that my bro and I are friends, but he's busy, I'm busy, and we see each other maybe 6 times a year.

Neither of us moved into the dorms, so we're both at home. We started dating last summer, so that puts us at nine months now. Everything had been going excellently until recently.

We had some serious problems in February. She wasn't happy, and cheated on me. We were off and on when she was doing this. While she was cheating on me, we had sex for the first time, we were both virgins. Not one week after that, we broke up and she had sex with the guy she had been seeing. 

After that, she wanted to get back together, so we are, and there's more honesty in the relationship, and I feel as though there is potential for it to be better than ever. However, she does what she wants, even knowing that it'll upset me. She's known from the start that I don't like drinking or smoking weed. She's been into drinking before, and I guess she enjoys it. All of her friends smoke weed and drink. I've never met any of her friends, because she says I wouldn't like them. She's tried smoking, knowing it would upset me. 

She doesn't care that it's important to me that she doesn't do these things, and I realize that it's her life, and she can do what she wants, but am I out of line for being upset that she doesn't seem to care how her actions make me feel? It's hard for me since we made it so long before any of this became a problem.

I want to be ok with her doing what she wants, but right now I am having a hard time trusting her and figuring out how to deal with all of this. It would be great if I could just accept who she's becoming, but drinking and smoking bother me, and I don't exactly know why, or how to make it less troubling.

Short bio: 5'8"", Red Hair, Better than average looking(girls/women tell me I'm cute/handsome often), Good shape(though a few girls thought I was too skinny), Confident, Intelligent, Balanced, Healthy(physically, mentally, spiritually), Not rich, but good with the money I do have, and working always on improving income, Interesting, Good at conversation, no fears(at least consciously), pretty mellow; though I can get fired up sometimes, but not in angry way, I like intelligence and honesty in a woman most.

Long story short: married young, 19, year later, kid arrives, wife can't handle kids(only breast feeds once, can't change diapers, nothing), leaves us, become single dad, this doesn't help since I'm already not very social/borderline anti-social, (met ex-wife on inet, irc chat), had a few online GF, tried LD, even in other countries, got nowhere, tried irl, backfired quickly, not sure if just socially awkward or just not experienced with meeting girls irl.

So, here's the issue: I find girl, I attract girl(somehow, idk how), I invest time, money, effort, attention, my all(and, I have good qualities: Honest, good money management, fair, work things out instead of get mad, resourceful, know how to please a woman, etc.), and I get nothing in return?  I'll please a girl, then she'll promise to please me, but somehow get out of it even if I try not to let her nicely. I'll do nice/romantic things, get taken for granted.  I'll make all the choices, she'll avoid making any.  I pay attention to her, not ALL the time, but all my attention when I am with her, and in return I get brushed off often, ignored, taken for granted.  I'll offer to pay for things, she never will.  I'll share drinks, food, candy, whatever, she rarely or never will?  

Not sure if I'm just too nice, or I let girls take advantage of my good and generous nature?  Are there really no balanced and good girls out there, or is this really my issue?  Am I attracting girls too young?  (all of my GF are younger than me by at least 5 years, my whole life--EDIT: Except ex-wife, she was 4 months younger than me, met online when we were both 16)) Is it too much to ask for there to be an honest exchange in a relationship?  Girls just seem really greedy these days, me me me, barely consider you at all unless it gets them something.  A few GF I had even made me think they were practically gold-diggers/hookerish, just wanted me to buy them things, but barely wanted to do anything REAL.

1330757954.0,5,self.ihaveissues,qfnqa,Lost at sea,ineededathrowawayacc,5,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/qfnqa/lost_at_sea/,"I've come to the realization that my upbringing has left me severely lacking in many departments essential to being a contributing member of society. This post isn't about that but serves as the basis for my larger issues. 

A little background on me: I come from a loving home or close enough to it. My dad always made a decent living so my sister and I never lacked for anything we needed. But now that I've graduated college, moved out and have a real job, I realize that I do nothing to improve myself or the world around me. When I get home from work, I generally get stoned within five minutes of arriving. From there, it's usually dicking around on Reddit, watching Netflix or playing Xbox until I eat nutritionally poor food and jerking off before going to bed. Honestly, probably not different than what many other mid twenties males do in America, but I seem unable to break from this trend. 

When I was going to college, I had lots of friends to hang out with and things to do. But now I only have three or four really good friends that I spend almost all of my spare time with, that is when they are around or available. Their work/social schedules often don't mesh with mine, so I'm usually left sitting at home, just being pissed off. Pissed off that I'm not good at being outgoing and attempting to make new friends.  Pissed off that my peers at work seem to have so much going on in their lives while I seemingly have shit. Pissed off because I know, god I know, that it's all my own doing. Pissed off that I have no one to blame but myself.

So my question is how do I break from this cycle? I know that the keys to most of our success, personal or otherwise, lies within. But what if you don't know how to unlock your own doors? 

I am a type one diabetic, so I was at a usual check up in January. I had received some really shitty results (another big issue for me) so I was feeling down. The doctor was new to me and very nice, so she tried to make me feel better by asking what I liked to do in my spare time. I looked at her and just lost control and broke down [Side note: I feel so terrible for that poor doctor]. I was so sad, so crushed because she asked just a simple question of what I liked to do and I had zero answers for her. It really put my life in a room with a light with no shade on it, just bright and glaring: I have very few hobbies or interests, I have very few friends to talk to or spend time with and no clue what to do with my life.

Things have been a little better since then but I still find myself looking at my life occasionally like a ship at sea, drifting towards a vortex or off the end of the world. I am not suicidal or anything but I often wish that a meteor would hit me in my sleep or a freak bus accident runs me off a cliff or I get caught up in a drive by shooting that removes me from the equation without me actually doing anything. My parents vacation a lot and if I don't hear from them I (pervertedly, disgustingly, self-loathingly) secretly hope that something happens and they don't return and my sister and I receive their life insurance, to which I'll just leave everything and everybody I've ever known behind and just go west, never make contact with anyone I've ever known and never be heard from again. 

Having said all of that, I don't think I'm ready to throw in the towel. I have a very good friend of mine who was recently on the brink of self-destruction. He blamed himself for the suicide of his best friend a couple of years ago which lead to nightly solo binge drinking and serious overeating; to the point that I didn't think he was going to make it till next year. But then something amazing happened: he sobered up and started a new diet, lost a bunch of weight. He pulled himself up by his short hairs and is now one hundred times the better for it. Why the fuck can't I do that? 

I feel like I have the pieces of the jigsaw in front of me and I know how they are supposed to fit, but the directions are in French and the page with the English directions was torn off. I mentioned earlier that I'm a diabetic that doesn't take the best care of my health. Save the comments, I know that is more important than pretty much anything. But I know that I don't want to be the guy who is blind/amputated/in a wheelchair at 30, because then I will definitely find a way out of this life if that happens. I know that a big part of my problem is that I smoke pot; not enough to be a danger to my livelihood but when I'm stoned I don't care about my health or eating well or not smoking cigarettes, all I care about is taking care of the asshole who is currently captaining the ship, the one who takes over when I get out of work and puts the voice that promotes exercise and vegetables in the brig until the next day. 

Does anybody have anything for to help me be the person I want to be? I hate asking for advice, but this isn't something I feel comfortable burdening my friends with and well, this is kind of the place for it. Sorry if it is disjointed/lacks solid narrative; if I go back and edit anything, I know I will just erase everything. Thanks if you read this far, I sincerely appreciate it.

tl;dr : mid twenties guy knows he needs to turn his life around but can't seem to get his shit together.

I'm 19, she's 19. We are both in college, we co-created a political organization on campus. We first met in one of my classes, after getting to know her for a few days, she suddenly asked me to create this group with her. Our relationship therefore is partly professional and partly 'emotional', as in I can tell there is something between us. There's a lot of running around, organizing people and socializing with the club etc... I've never been more social in my life since I decided to run this organization with her. Growing up I've never really had a girlfriend, I've spent too much time concentrating on my professional swimming/playing around with guy friends. Girls are something I unfortunately didn't have the balls to go after in between growing up to this age. 

Now that I feel there is a girl that is really interested in me, I'm 'improvising' on how to react to the situation. My main reaction is acting like I'm not very interested in her. She gets a lot of attention from guys regularly, but I can tell she likes the way I treat her better. Simply because I'm the one who works hard with her in class and with our group, and I don't act cool, I act like myself... problem is I act too much like myself not having the balls to go after her. But right now I'm at a point where I need to make a move before she thinks I don't like her, and finds someone else. But at the same time I don't want to ruin our amazing friendship if she feels weird about it... 

**My epic relationship mistakes:**

* She asked me to ride the bus with her once, I said ""okay"", even though I was driving while she called. I drove back home, took the bus but missed her. She hasn't asked me again since.

* I have a hard time making eye contact with her because A: she's really attractive and B: I hardly make eye contact with anyone when I talk to them. 

* I always text her because I'm awkward on the phone. Honestly I sound like an idiot trying to gather my thoughts. I am slowly working on sounding confident, but she can tell I'm nervous. I'm going to call her tomorrow for the first time... so yeah small steps.

* She asked if I wanted a coffee once, I said no cause I had class. Minutes after making that horrible mistake, I skipped class to find her on campus and say 'yes'. She finished her coffee and was talking to another guy, I didn't approach the table.

* At parties, socials and pub nights I hardly talk to her about personal stuff. Once she called me over Her: ""Hey [quals1] talk to me bro, I wanna know what you're up to"". Me: ""The political situation in the country seems dire, we have to include this and this point in our agenda next week."" I ruined what could have been the most amazing night of my life, because I was scared of getting into a deep conversation with her, turning it into work related BS.

**Remaining hope:**

She knows that we are great friends, both in class and the work we do. But I feel she really lost hope in our relationship possibilities after my anti-social behavior for the last few months.

**Final question, also the TL;DR:** I know, I am one of the biggest screw ups when it comes to girls. I'm fortunate to look like a 'ladies man', but I have 0 relationship skills, which are being worked on. What can I do the next time we meet to make up for all these problems that I've created?

Age: 19(turn 20 in a month)
Gender: male
Relationship status:single

The rest will be revealed throughout the post. This really isn't easy for me to write, but I feel I need to because nothing else I've tried so far has worked out for me. I've seen Reddit do a lot of good things, so I hope that maybe one of those good things will fall in my favor if I'm lucky. I'm an almost 20 year old who has no idea what he's doing dating wise.

This started in junior high, when I began to desire girls and all that jazz. I started having crushes, but I could never A. find the courage to ask them or B. ever be smooth enough or what have you to get a yes from them. The only yes I ever got in junior high was my best friend at the time to a formal dance, because her boyfriend couldn't come(went to another school).

Let's fast forward to high school, where it gets really bad. In four years of high school, I had a grand total of one real date. One. I was 15 at the time, and the girl I went out with turned out to be a Skankasaurus. She was one of the types that would bang first, ask questions(like what's your name) later. She offered to have sex on that first date, and saying no was something I don't regret. Outside that, my total in high school was around 25 girls who said ""no"" to me. They ranged from top of the high school pecking order, smart people, athletes, nerds, and just the average student. It cut a wide cross section, because I figured I had to try everywhere.

That didn't work out obviously, so I said ""OK when I get to college it'll be different."" I grew up in a small town, where everyone knew each other so I figured it would work to my benefit going to a town literally 10 times the population(10,000 to 100,000). I move, and I still haven't had much luck. All the girls I try to engage usually have boyfriends, or just aren't interested. Well, maybe they are but I'll get to that in a second.

My predicament is this: I really don't know what I'm doing Reddit. I have very little confidence(for obvious reasons), and even when I finally get it up to where I'd like it I either find taken girls or I miss the signs when I could have been accepted(this happened several times where I misread cues). I find it very hard to deal with this, and it wasn't a problem until now. I feel a lot of social pressure because my two best friends are both in long term relationships, with a third being married.

I've never been intimate with a woman, hell I haven't even kissed a girl yet. I don't feel I'm overly unattractive(6ft 1, about 195-205 depending on weekly nom nom intake), and I've been told by girls who are friends that I'd be a good boyfriend. I feel the same way, but I really don't know what I'm doing out there. 

I'm concerned because I'm starting to feel a lot more lonely, and a lot less happy without having someone to be around. Not in the sense of I want to get laid, or anything like that. I want more for the company, for the intangibles a stable relationship brings. It's not about the physical to me, but being in college where I don't drink(straightedge) it's a bit hard to relate.

That's about it really. I'm just looking for help, help to feel like a 20 year old who can achieve and maintain a healthy relationship with a female instead of feeling like a seven year old. I'm happy to provide any additional details if requested, anything to help you understand my situation better and by proxy to help me more. Thank you, have a nice day and thanks for reading this.

Am I doing something wrong?",apparentlydoingwrong,5,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/q5fg4/guys_complaining_about_not_being_able_to_find_a/,"I'm a 21 year old female, and lately I've been wondering just where I'm going wrong. I've never been in a relationship, although I have been in love with two people. The first time was with a girl I met online. We pseudo-dated (never wanting to make it official because of the distance) for about a year. It was the plan that I was going to move to her country and live with her when I'd finished university. She then met somebody else and broke it off with me. After a year of us trying to be friends, I decided I couldn't take it, because I was unable to get over her, so initiated no contact. I was pretty hurt at the time, because I loved her with everything I could give, but I now know that uprooting my whole life to live with her would've been a ridiculous move. I'm fine with the way things turned out. This happened a year ago. 

The second time was with a guy I met around this time last year. We were casual acquaintances for about 6 months before becoming friends. After a few weeks of talking on facebook, we met up for coffee and things escalated from there. Ended up seeing each other every day and talking on facebook from good morning to good night. He'd sleep over at my house on the weekends because he missed me, introduced me to his immediate family, and we had planned a camping trip together to see the Aurora Australis (since seeing this was a dream we learned we both shared). After about five months of this, he started withdrawing. It got worse and worse until he didn't bother talking to me at all. I tried to speak to him about it various times, but he kept blowing me off. It was at this point that I initiated no contact. This happened a month and a half ago and I am still quite cut up about it as I have no idea why it happened.

Both of these things have made me question what I'm doing wrong. Neither of the people I've been in love with have, for various reasons, wanted to start a relationship with me, and it's not like I have people beating down my door. I feel like I've had to suffer through the bad parts of relationships (the heartbreak, rejection, and having to move on) without getting all the good stuff that normal people share. I have hobbies, I'm a postgrad neuroscience student, and I apparently have a good sense of humor/interesting personality...so what gives? I'm not desperate for a relationship right now since I'm pretty busy with various things, but it'd be nice to know that the option is there. I just feel like I'm not relationship material, and I don't know why. In my 21 years of life I've only met two people that I've REALLY clicked with, and neither wanted to be with me. I don't want to have to wait years before I click with somebody again. My confidence can't help but be shaken. I'd like some suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong, or how to meet new and interesting people. I hear all these guys complaining that the 'good women' are taken, that they will end up alone, etc. But I'm here, being my (hopefully) awesome self, and nobody seems to be interested. The consensus seems to be that a girl can get a guy at any time. It seems this way from reading reddit, anyhow. Yet that doesn't seem to hold up in my case. It makes me feel unworthy because, apparently, even the desperate guys don't seem to notice me.

**TL;DR** Of the two people I've been in love with, neither wanted to be in a relationship with me. Makes me think I'm not relationship material and want to know how to fix this, or just how to meet new and awesome people. Cheers Reddit!

**EDIT:** Yes, these above examples may seem like relationships, but they never were. Nothing was ever explicitly said and no real commitments were ever made. If I were to say that either of these people were my boyfriend/girlfriend, I would be wrong. This worries me because I don't want the pattern to continue. It makes me wonder why these people have been on the cusp of being in a relationship with me, and then completely pulling away instead of committing. I don't want to have to keep getting over people without actually having been in a relationship with them.

I'm completely fine at interacting with women when I'm just being friendly and have no further intentions than just being friendly with them, I'm now one of the most well-known people on my campus and have many many female friends who I get on with well, but I have found that due to heavy and incredibly harsh rejections in the past I have anxiety issues when it comes to trying to create connections and have ALWAYS been shot down by women I have pursued, often creating a rift with other friends who aforementioned women are close with, thus slowly screwing over my social circle.
I moved cities last year due to study and since then have been very careful of who I approach and how I approach as to minimise any damage I will more than likely do to my friendships. I have got laid twice since then (27F and 20F respectively) which I am reasonably proud of but neither of them wanted something serious out of it. 

I don't want to be that guy who has to have sex with a girl before she'll even consider being in a relationship with him. Help??

It's starting to ruin my life.",throwaway5554435,8,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/ptklz/i_dont_feel_like_i_love_anybody_and_dont_feel/,"**Backstory** I'm a 21 year old female and I feel terribly alone. In the course of my life, I have been in love with two people. The first, I parted ways with on good terms. We had never dated, but I loved her deeply. She, at one point, had felt the same about me, but there were too many things standing in our way (distance, she was involved with somebody else already, etc). After a year of me being terribly hurt whilst we tried to 'be friends', I told her that I couldn't keep her in my life anymore and had to move on. We had a long, emotional and yet somehow rational conversation about it all, said our goodbyes, and parted ways. Even though I knew it was for the best, I felt lost afterwards. Six months on and I hadn't improved. I saw the world as grey. I felt excited about nothing, and living was an effort.

After 6 months of this, I met a guy. He was deeply passionate about life, and sinfully intelligent. We clicked immediately, but I was wary of getting myself into something, so I stayed cautious. He pursued me for two months, and I finally opened up to him and let him see me as I am. We never dated, but saw each other every day. For five months, he was sweet, loyal, caring, and devoted. The way he looked at me - it have never seen somebody care for me like that. But after five months, he started pulling away. Eventually he stopped talking to me all together, and never told me why, even though I asked many times. I decided it was time to move on and deleted him from my life. I sent him a short and polite email detailing why I was doing what I was doing, but he never replied. 

It's been 4 months since he started pulling away, and nearly two months since I last spoke to him. I am still a wreck. It seems ridiculous for me to still be feeling this way, since it's been so long and our time together was relatively short. I feel betrayed, because he was the one who pursued me, and then emotionally abandoned me when I had opened up. However - that is just backstory to my problem.

**Poblem** I don't feel loved, and I don't feel like I love anybody. I have some good friends - some great friends even - but I never feel like seeing them. When I do see them, all I want to do is go home. I don't feel connected to them at all. My best friend I have known for my entire 21 years of life and I don't feel any sort of love for her. She got me something for valentines day because she knew I was feeling like crap, and I felt nothing in response. I outwardly gushed and gave her hugs, but inside...no feeling. As such, I don't feel like my friends love me. I don't feel that they care to be around me, or that they feel any sort of true feeling for me. I live with my parents, but I don't feel like I love them. I know they do, because they're my parents, but I don't feel it.

I feel like this is ruining my life. I never feel happy, because I know what happiness (ie, to love) feels like. All I feel is an emptiness inside. I'm back to seeing the world as an effort to live in, and I'm sick of it. It was triggered by the rejection I felt from that guy, and I hate it. I know he's not worth me feeling like this and, to be honest, I don't really miss him. I miss the love that he brought with him. I've tried so hard to be happy within myself, but I feel that I won't be truly happy until somebody loves me like that again. And I know that to do this is to waste my life. I VERY rarely connect with people, so it could be years before I meet somebody who makes me feel loved. I don't want to spend from now until then feeling this empty. I have hobbies but don't really enjoy them anymore, so can't throw myself into activities to keep myself busy. Please, could somebody help me? Has anybody else felt like this? How did you get over it? I just want to be able to live normally and enjoy my life - because, to be honest, wasting my youth like this scares me more than I could have ever imagined.

Been dating for 1.5 years. I've had a few relationships before but I'm her first. We knew each other as friends for several years before we started dating.

For the first 6 months of our relationship, we saw each other once or twice a week because we were about an hour away from each other, we spoke on the phone every night even if for a little bit.

Second ~6 months, we were closer and spent a lot more time together, but it was usually studying, which I didn't mind.

Now, we both work (very different schedules) but we still manage to see each other almost every day. We generally just eat, watch TV, go to the gym together, or talk. We have some trips for fun, but it's not often because I work weekdays and she works weekdays/weekends.

We're in a position right now where she wants to hang out at every opportunity (every time we're both free) which is pretty much at some point every day, which honestly, is too much for me.

I love her to death, but I usually feel I need alone time, usually a couple of days a week. I feel like I'm being selfish, but I also feel like her attitude towards us spending time together is exacerbating that feeling. I don't necessarily have anything better to do, I just want some time to myself.

I feel like every day I have to kick her out of my house because I'm tired, and I have work at 8am the next morning. However, I lie because I say I'm going to bed but I usually stay up for another hour or two on my computer, because no matter what I need a little time to myself before I go to bed (like right now). This especially happens on weekdays, I get up for work at 7, get home at 5/5:30, and I'll hang out with her from 6 until midnight 4 nights out of the week.

She's aware of my feelings about it, and I think she's trying to be understanding, but it's a constant struggle. Just tonight she asked ""do you want to do x tomorrow, or do you need some alone time?"" It's great that she's trying to be understanding, but it's still stressful, and I'm not sure how to handle it.

How should I approach this? Am I asking too much, or is she? Is this fixable?

1329280441.0,5,self.ihaveissues,pq9jp,22y/o Male. Had 3 girlfriends ever. All 3 cheated on me. Is it my fault? Will I ever be able to trust women again?,,5,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/pq9jp/22yo_male_had_3_girlfriends_ever_all_3_cheated_on/,"Hey :3 First time poster, so go easy on me please :)

As the title says, I'm a 22 year old male, and in my entire life I've only had 3 relationships that lasted any significant amount of time, and I've been cheated on in all 3 of them. What I'd like to know is; am I bringing this on myself? And how can I learn to Trust again?





Details time:
The first time I was cheated on happened when I was 16 years old. She was also 16, and we'd been together for about 4 months. Things seemed to be going great, we didn't argue, we loved spending time together and (I thought) we were happy together, then she cheated on me with the guy who was my best friend at the time. They're together now, have been ever since. It hurt, but it wasn't too bad, it's not like we were in love, and I could see that my ex-buddy and ex-girlfriend were, so I guess I just let it go.





The second time was a frighteningly similar story. This time I was 18, and she was 17. We'd been together for just over 5 months and I was starting to have seriously strong feelings for her (at the time I thought it was love, but since when do 18 year old boys know what love is?). Again, things had been going great between us, no fall outs, no arguments, no negative friction or tension at all.... Or so I thought. She had been sleeping with, you guessed it, one of my closest friends. This time I was pretty devestated, I'm pretty sure that the cheating and breakup pushed me over the edge into my very first depression (but that's a whole other story). It took me a very long time to get over. I stopped trying to find romance at all, under the assumption that I would just get hurt again....




Then, a long time later, girl number 3 came along. By this time I was 21 and I considered myself to be a bit stronger and wiser. I still wasn't actively looking for love, but I was open to the idea of it, and when she walked into my workplace and our eyes met and she smiled at me I turned to freaking jelly on the spot. I'd never felt anything like it, but I was too shy to do anything. I could give the full details of how we got together, as they're still fresh in my mind, (even though this happened about 10 months ago now) but I think a wall o' text like that would garentee that my first reddit post goes uncommented :p
Anyway where was I? Oh yeah, girl 3 and I eventually started dating, about a month after she first walked into my workplace, and things were amazing. We were both so happy together, (her friends would actually approach me on the street and thank me for having made her so happy!) and had soon fallen completely in love. We were going to spend our lives together, we knew it. But then, around 7 months into the relationship things started to change. She started hanging round with other guys constantly - guys who openly admitted to having feelings for her. She always told me they were just friends, and that I was just being paranoid because of my ""unfortunate"" past. Then one day I got the phone call, ""I'm so sorry, I sold myself to another guy last night"". That's right, not only did she cheat on me, she prostituted herself to an old man. Needless to say, it's over now.


I was, and still am, heartbroken. Anyone who's done their maths (if indeed anyone has read this at all) will know that girl 3 was recent.


I don't know if this is just because of how low I am at the moment, but I can't imagine ever trusting a woman enough to love her again. Right now it just seems like every time I let someone in I get hurt, so the logical solution is to stop letting people in, right?


Oh and I know what some of you are probably thinking, I'm not terrible in bed, I'm actually certain that I'm pretty damn good :p


So back to my original questions:

1) Am I bringing this pain on myself? Am I choosing the wrong women? Am I just plain unlucky?

2) How can I learn to forget the past and trust again? I don't want to hold my bad experiences over the heads of every female I ever meet from now on.


Any comments would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance

Thanks to a 6 month getaway from my home provence I was able to find perspective on my situation and finally start loving myself again. I would love to say that I am back to 100 percent but unfortunately that just is not the case. See, I was never all that smooth with the ladies to begin with though I would never have a problem striking up a conversation and making them laugh with my awkward and endearing humor but somewhere along the way I just stopped trying. To provide a little insight into my situation, some things need to be explained. I dropped out of high school in grade 11 because it was geting way too much to show my face in public and in this time all I did was smoke pot, drink on weekends and play video games. Needless to say I became a recluse and being in public scared the shit out of me some days. This went on for about 2 years until my sister suggested that I remove myself from that situation and move out to western Canada and work at the same hotel as her. In my time there I reflected a lot, began to make amends with what has happened in my life, met some really cool people who showed me how to be independent and mended the long strained relationship with my father. With all these great things happening for me I gained a confidence to push forward with my life and I am very proud to say I am back in school getting grades that I never thought I had the potential for. I should be at ease now but one thing remains, I am hopelessly lonely. To tell the truth all I have every wanted is to have someone to share my life with but every time I am in a near a girl (other then a select few) my body works against me, I begin to shake, get sweaty, stutter uncontrollably and loose all my wit that makes me an awesome person. It's not like I am a horrible looking person at all, admittedly I am overweight but I am fixing that. So I am looking for advice from people who have been through a similar situation or anyone that can share some insight.

I'm in my second semester at my first year of university, and I don't really know what I'm doing or what I want to be doing. I'm a Physics/Music Composition major, but I don't think I want to do either of those. Every day in the music department I feel I find something that makes me not want to be a musician for life, so I'm thinking of learning things on my own…physics, idk, I just don't care, and I definitely don't know what I want to do with it. When people ask me what I want to do after college, I want to reply ""eat,"" as in ""make enough money so I don't starve."" My parents keep advising me to stay with physics because people are so impressed with it (which seems to be impressed, based on reactions when I tell them), but I feel like math is a better major for people who don't know what they want to do (but are still good at math)?

Anyway, I don't even have any marketable skills or anything…I've never worked a tax-paying job in my life, and I'm deathly afraid of it, because I can't help but think that every minute I spend on the job, all the things that I could accidentally do to get myself fired. One of the worst examples of this is sleeping: last year, I had a huge problem staying awake through just about anything, regardless of how interested I was in it (parts due to medication I was on at the time, parts due to stress, parts due to regular high school schedules). I was pretty much guaranteed to fall asleep at some point in the middle of the day, and it was usually during class. Every Monday I had to drive my dad to the airport (longish irrelevant story) and I can count the times on one hand that I didn't nod my head on the road (I only got in a nondangerous accident once, thank God, but every time it happened was horrifying). Now it feels like whenever I am doing something where bad things would happen if I fall asleep, or even watching people do things that would suck if they fell asleep, I get really scared and think ""but what would happen if they fell asleep?"" (during Obama's Google+ hangout, I kept thinking about his guests, ""what if they fall asleep????"")

I also really hate/am sort of afraid of applications, because I feel like, no matter what I'm applying for, I have to lie to even be able to compete with the other applicants, because I have so few things to put on there…

What do I do in my spare time? Reddit. I know for a lot of people, too much reedit seems like a lot of wasted time, but I feel like my time isn't totally wasted because I love Reddit because I'm always learning…I really do love learning. Even if I don't always have good grades, I like learning things. I like politifact.com and freakonomics and r/truereddit and r/srsdiscussion, and I feel like my love of learning is one of my few redeeming qualities. But who gives a fuck? How do I turn a love of learning into something useful? I know a lot of stuff, but idk what I want to do with it.

I don't know where else to go and I figure this is the best place.

I have serious trust issues. Since middle school I have always suspected friends harboring secret feelings of dislike for me and this paranoia has not only caused me to lose all of my old friends but also to fail to find new ones. 

I know exactly how it started too. A friend of mine in middle school helped a rather nasty asshole in a plan to kill me. Yeah, shit's fucked up. It was only because I was walking with another friend that their plan was aborted. What happened was my other friend saw the bully sneaking up behind us with a baseball bat but as soon as he lost the element of surprise he ran off.

At this point I need to go off on a slight tangent. The friend I was with was female. Up to this point most of my friends had been males. Afterward I never talked to any guys. I just can never seem to trust any males. 

Afterward I had problems trusting anyone and even when there was no way that a friend was plotting anything or harboring secret feelings. As a result I started keeping my emotional distance from people. It was so bad that even when I was dating a close friend I didn't talk about my feelings at all. We ended up breaking up over this which has caused me way too much grief.

I now am in college and the only person I ever really talk to is a co-worker of mine. We're not exactly friends, more like close acquaintances. We always end up just chatting about books, school or reddit memes. I don't really feel like I could talk about anything emotional with her which is how I am essentially friendless. 

TBH part of me hopes that my co-worker realizes who I am and tries to get me to open up just so I would have someone to talk to. I HIGHLY doubt that she would realize who I am even if she did read this reddit, and even if she did I recognize how unfair it would be of me to put this all on her. I just add this in to give you an idea of my emotional state.

About a year ago I ended up rooming with a guy a couple years younger than me in some college dorms. I tried to become emotionally close to him because I was starting to feel desperate. I feel like I may have spilled out my emotions way too much. I don't know if it was because of this, or the fact the he has a new girlfriend, but despite having a half-way decent friendship for a time, we don't talk anymore. This is probably a good example of my paranoia. I tend to think everything is my fault even when it is something completely uncontrollable. 

Going 5 years without making a single friend seems beyond ridiculous. I already know I'm introverted (which is the only reason I haven't gone totally mad) but even I need to solve this issue.

One major problem I have is that I have NO idea how to develop a close friendship anymore. I don't know how to keep the right distance between completely spilling all of my emotional baggage on someone and keeping everything close to my chest. Out of all my problems, I think this has become the most major one.

I apologize again. I didn't quite mean to write out an essay, I just really need help. I'd see a professional about this but I have neither the money nor the time. Thank you for reading this even though you didn't have to. Even if no one reads this, at least I've been able to really solidify what is going wrong for myself.

ME(30M) HER(21F)

Ok I'll start from lastnight.

I've been doing Standup comedy for a while now(about 10months) and have been seeing this girl (21) around one particular spot that I perform at.

Well we talk for a bit as I know one of her mates as he compares a night there, I gave  her my number over Facebook and  told to give me a call or TxT sometime .
So a day and half after that she sends me a txt,end up txting each other about 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 weeks and had 2 two hour phonecalls that felt like they by in minutes ,til last night .

We met up for a coffee and talked for about an hour then headed to the spot where I perform ( we both know people there). Anyway I get talking to her and honestly I think she is amazing, she works at a expensive pub in central London,she goes to Uni (and is in the top 5 students in her subjects) and also she interns at a prestigious law firm.
she's extremely well read and funny and clever. Her family are liberal caring and funny (she is also very pretty ,I think most of her guy friends have a crush on her) ,so her upbringing is pretty different from mine.
Well as you can see now I'm totally smitten with her but she really busy only gets one night to herself, I asked her when I would get to see her again and she said probably in two weeks. Now let me tell you about my self

 When I was 5 I witnessed my father kicking the shit out of my mum ,it's pretty much affected my attude to violence, my father was a scary drink an could turn at the drop of a hat (not on his kids but adults)(also taught me how to handle drunk people). 

When my parents got divorced I would stay with my dad and his gf(who also happened to be my mums sister).between the ages of 6-10 I was sexually abuse by my dad(him touching me when he was drunk) and by an older cousin ( who I had to share a bed with,he would touch me too). I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex ( the closest I've come to sex was making out).I have suffered from depression for most of my life but most people never get to see that,they  me see laughing and cracking jokes all the time.

I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.
I'm not sure she even likes me like that, could be just be being nice.
Also could I ever be normal ? 
I mean have a caring loving relationship with someone who I can tell everything too,someone who would love me?
I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.
I often think about suicide but won't do it till my mum dies, and I'm smart enough to make it look like an accident.

So reddit this is the question,
Does this girl like me?
Can I find love and happiness?
How do you get over witnessing domestic abuse and child abuse?
Is life worth living?


Here's a little story
When I was 5 I started school,after the first week I was moved to a different class,I was given a letter to give to my parents explaining why I had to move class (I had trouble with my abc).
So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating),that I'm dumb and need to learn my abcs.
So at the weekend my mum drops my dad to work,as he's getting out he tells her ""make sure jestersidiot learns his abc"".

Now in the car my brother and I convince my mum to take us to the park,end up playing football then go home and watch some tv.
My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 
Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.

So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying ,mum says to him that jestersidiot is a kid should have some fun.well the argument escalates to yelling and then he gets up out of his chair and starts beating her .
punches to the face ,grabbing her by the throat and throwing her to the ground ,still punching and kicking her.then he gets down on her and starts punching her in the face like she's a man.while standing there my older brother(7 at the time) walks over to see whats happening with my baby sister(who was 3 at the time)
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,my mother is screaming for her mother till the day I die I'll never forgot that sound.he stops hitting her and moves me and my siblings to the living room where we watch tv,I make an excuses to go to the kitchen(to check on my mum) but she's not there ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .


ABOUT ME
I am the darkest one in my family,so growing up I got all the dark/black jokes about my skin tone.I was constantly bullied by people(some times white or black but mainly southeast asians).

It didn't stop when I got home because that's when my brother would bully me.I pretty much wished I was dead everyday when I was a kid.funny thing is if people were to describe me back then they would probably say I was a class clown.
I recently told my mum,brother and sister about the abuse (just about my dad not my cousin). 

I've had to be there for a friend who has been diagnosed with liver damage so I've had to be there for him,telling him to be positive and what he can do(keep getting doctors opinions till he is satisfied,speaking to liver disease groups and ARM himself info about what going on with his liver). Also arranged for a party for him so people could see him.
I'm still fighting depression and so times its hard to get out of bed.
I drink too much and smoke ,eat the wrong shit.
I've been unemployed for a longtime and my CV looks like shit.
But sometimes I have hope.
The thing with this girl I spent so much time alone that, i cant believe that someone could even like me that.
 
Well I guess it doesn't matter now,I txted her but she never got back to me.
I think I came on too strong Nevermind plenty more fish that don't want my bait. Or maybe she's busy ,or more likely she saw right through me.

A bit of detail first: I am a 24-year old male living in Florida, and I haven't been in a stable relationship since '08. I also haven't had a relationship longer than three months at a time.

 My biggest problem is just how lonely I feel. I've been single for so long that sometimes I think I won't able to find anybody who would think I was worth their time. The dating scene just feels so much like a popularity contest, and if you fuck up once at any time, the game is over, you lose, do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Not to mention the fact that it's hard for me to feel like I'd be anybody's first choice for a relationship. 

 If it was merely a matter of nerves, I'd just suck it up and go for it. But then the physical symptoms kick in. If I tried to talk to a woman I really found attractive, I'd start shaking and sweating, and the words never come out right. Nobody likes to talk to a shaky man covered in sweat and talking some sort of moon language. I'm just so lost when it comes to what you should say and do.

 I don't want to be like this anymore. I've tried to get better. I signed up for OKCupid and even talked to a few cute girls who seemed interested, but I never sealed the deal and got a date. Lately, I haven't even written to women whose profiles seem interesting, because I don't want to have a good conversation with them only to basically never see or talk to them again. 

 I've been getting in my own way so often that it is now the norm for me. Even the physical symptoms I described earlier were something that started around Summertime, and just became a normal reaction. I'm becoming more and more of a social recluse, and I'm scared that I won't be able to do anything about it. Hell, the one time in the past year that I was able to get a girl to genuinely like me and even agree to date me, she breaks the whole thing up because of my awkwardness. That is a particularly painful memory, because I was absolutely head-over-heels for her.

 That's about it, really. I'll be around to answer any specific questions and to read your advice, so please, help a brother out. 

TL;DR- Being around women I'm attracted to makes me too nervous to even talk to them, and the fear of being alone has exasperated that nervousness. ",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_p06fh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/p06fh/im_alone_and_i_got_no_one_to_blame_but_myself/,

I'm 32, and I've been on 2 dates in my life, the last one almost 7 years ago.  Never kissed, and of course that means I'm a Virgin.

The good part is that for the past 8 years or so I've slowly tried to work myself out of it.  Personality wise I'm night and day from where I started, and while I do like to stay home I do occasionally go out, but I'm perfectly happy to experience the moment alone and that is the problem. I can't follow up, or keep people interested to let anything (friendship or relationship) develop.  I've assumed that it was just some hangup of anxiety I had, but tonight I couldn't sleep because I finally realized it's how I've always done it.

Childhood friends -  Didn't live in areas that had a lot of kids.  When I briefly did I usually was made fun of because I was gullible or just wasn't good at things like sports. After a while I just stopped associating with them and that was that.

School -  mostly the same, except by the time I reached high school I consciously made the decision to do my own thing. While I did have a few friends, it was just at school.  I even made the statement several times in the past that they were associates.   In later years, I was told that I was mysterious, people knew my face, or name and that was it.

20s -  I did develop a few friendships during my early 20s, but now I'm not for sure if it genuine, or just because we had similar interests.  Around 24 I started to consciously try to do better, and become more social, but in retrospect I went about it the wrong way.  The roommates I had back then were extroverted, went out a lot and while I tried to hang in the end I ended up in a deep depression and social anxiety, especially since they all eventually dated, moved away or married and I still couldn't figure out how to even get a girl to agree to a date.

30s -  It took me a while get over all of it, but I'm more social, I can manage my anxiety and the people who know me has seen a difference.  However, the amount of people I call friends I can count on one hand, and even then I can go weeks or months without talking to them.  They are married, and do the things that married couples do, and I just can't relate.  I don't want these relationships to just suddenly end like the others, but I feel it slipping.

Went out for about two years before breaking up, last few months were just arguing etc. Haven't really spoken to her since tonight where we spoke over Facebook. She took something I said totally the wrong way and I went a bit OTT in trying to explain to her I didn't mean anything by it, getting really over-analytical. 
Despite her insistence that she has no lasting issues with me, she reminded me of how much of an asshole I was in our dying days, comparing her to other ex's I'd had and commenting on her weight etc, as well as the horrible temper I had where I'd go batshit at inanimate objects (never her).
The whole thing tonight kinda came to a crescendo when I was, again, being a bit over-analytical as I tried to make sense of it all, and she told me:

""Ever since I met you, you've acted like an under-appreciated scholar. But you're actually just a bit of a loser"".

I was absolutely speechless, because she's kinda right. I'm fairly clever, but I've never done anything with it, and previously all I did was complain about how life isn't handed to me on a plate. That single sentence resonated with me so much (I was honestly on the cusp of tears from that one sentence), because I'm convinced this is a reasonably common consensus about me but, because I'm a pretty assertive guy who's infamous for always having a retort, nobody else I know wants to be the one to tell me that I actually kinda suck.
I'm normally a bit more upbeat than this, but I'm in a pretty low point right now, having not long returned from travelling and having to start again in my economically inferior home city.

25 male here.  I haven't been in a real relationship in about 3.5 years.  In those 3.5 years, I've only had sex with six people, and for me it's pretty lonesome.  The main thing I miss, apart from the sex of course, is the intimacy.  I really enjoy being close to someone and physically touching and kissing them.  I get really excited about affection.

Every so often, I'll find a girl and get super excited about her, and end up thinking she's the one, and they usually end up leaving me after I get too close to them, usually before we have sex.  

It's happening again, these days with a girl who lives in on the opposite coast of the country (I certainly know how to pick them).  We met 2 summers ago through a friend when she came to California to help her friend move.  The next summer, my friend and I went to visit her on the east coast for a fantastic week with her.  We hit it off really well, to the point where I could totally ask her to be my girlfriend, except for the whole living on opposite sides of the country.

I went to visit her for a couple days a couple weeks ago, and leading up to it, we were really excited to see each other and sending each other cheesy texts and what not.  Once I got there, we spent a great night out getting drinks, however, I probably drank a bit too much and got a case of whiskey dick when we got home (also, it was the first time we were gonna have sex, so I was quite nervous as I wanted it to be perfect).

The next day, she showed me around her neighborhood, and we enjoyed the day.  We walked back to her place after getting groceries holding hands.  I can tell you right now, it brings tears to my eyes every time I think about it (this has never happened before with anyone else). 

We have a pot luck that night with her friends, and I'm quite nervous as I want to make a great impression.  It goes well, and finally after the last person leaves, we begin to clean up.  As we discuss during out clean up, the topic of the future comes up and I begin to get nervous.  I tell her how I feel, and how holding hands with her was amazing, and she agrees, however, she doesn't want to commit too much to anything as we don't live in the same area.  and I agree.  We also talked about how I should probably see a therapist over my social anxieties.  somehow, the conversation continues, and I end up becoming very afraid that I screwed it all up.  I've done this before, however, with this girl, I REALLY don't want it to go sour.  So I begin to cry in front of her as I'm terrified everything is going wrong, and me crying only gets me to think worse about the situation.  She reassures me that if it doesn't work out between us, it won't be because I cried in front of her.  

The next day was really tough, as it felt like she was distant from me and didn't want to get to close.  It felt like the elephant in the room that no one wants to comment on.  That night however, we end up going out for dinner to a nice place, and I begin to relax and make fun of myself, and she seems to relax as well..

When we get home, we continue to chat a bit, and I massage her feet (I love giving massages).  She begins to fall asleep, so I mention that we should head to bed, where I give a full back massage, and we fall asleep.  The next day was the day I left.  Before I left, she mentioned to me that if anything were to come up in my hometown with another girl, that I shouldn't hold myself back, which kind of disappointed me.  However, she did mention that she wished I would have stayed a bit longer so she could get to know me more.  We texted a bit that day after I took a shuttle to the airport, and the day afterwards when i was back in my hometown.

However now, we haven't texted or emailed in the past 3 days, and I feel like I'm getting obsessed about her, constantly checking facebook to see if she liked or posted anything on my wall...  Everytime my phone goes off, I rush to it hoping it's her.  

This kind of behavior has happened before, where I'm constantly hoping to get some sort of response from her.  Is that normal or healthy?

To be honest, even despite the distance, I really want something to work out with her.  She's absolutely fantastic, and I feel like I found the girl I really want to be with.  

anyhow, if you've read to this point, I really appreciate your time.  I know it's long and it can be hard sometimes to connect with someone's deep emotional stress..

I guess my ultimate question is I need help understanding if it's love or if it's just lust and obsession. And if it's obsession, can that turn into love?  :/",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_okm2q,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/okm2q/i_keep_getting_myself_into_situations_where_i/,

I'm 21[M] currently staying away home for my second year of University. 

I'm a virgin and suffer from premature ejaculation, well, it's more I'm a virgin because I suffer from premature ejaculation. I've had interest from a few girls, I can flirt, dance and make out in clubs but if it comes to anything else I always make excuses. A while ago my female housemates best friend Amy visited (they live a long way away). She stayed for a few days and we got along great and kissed before she went home.

We texted a lot (basically everyday) for a few months and became very close. When Amy was having a party I traveled with my housemate to her home town for a few days to attend. The party was good and because my housemate was doing other things on the other days I got to spend a lot of time with Amy, two days and one night. The time I spent with her is hard to describe because we didn't really do much, but it was the most amazing not much. The night I spent with her she tried to initiate sex, from how were getting along this didn't supprise me. I pretended I was too tired so we just slept with each other. That short time I spent with her I'd probably count as some of the best moments of my life. Holding hands and trying to catch each others thumbs on the bus, how she snuggled into me when we watched a film, when we were in bed how we spooned and she hooked her leg behind mine to pull me closer. 

Amy is amazing, and now months after we still text all the time. I like her just as much, if not more, and if I could be with her I couldn't imagine myself more happy. But I'm aware we live a long way away and it isn't practical, as does she. If she got a boyfriend I don't think that would bother me too much if she was happy. What she really did was show me how amazing a relationship with someone you care about can be, and how lonely I am. She's made me think about what I'm missing and also how, because of my sexual problems and the fear of sex they cause, I can't have that relationship. I'm starting to become quite depressed about it.

Before I even met Amy I worked up the courage to talk to a doctor about my premature ejaculation but he was unhelpful and I havn't had the courage since.

About a year and some change ago, my (now ex) boyfriend of over 18 months moved out of state for a temp job. (If it matters, he's two years younger than me.) Before he left, he had me convinced that I should quit my job, and move out to be with him.

A few weeks after he gets there (surprise!) he dumps me over the phone. I'll spare you the laundry list of bullshit excuses. 

Well, after having a girlfriend and spending all his money, he came back into town last year. While he had been gone, I became very close with a lot of the friends he left behind.

Now that he's back, he's been pretty much jumping through hoops to avoid me. I only contacted him once, right before he got back to town, asking if we could talk. That's it. He never responded. 

This shit is KILLING ME. I don't even want him back, because I see him as a pretty shitty person, and everything he has ever said to me (yes, including ""I love you"") is now suspect. And just pretending he doesn't exist is pretty much impossible now that his circle of friends has become mine. Everybody's been pretty good and not high school drama about the situation, taking care to keep us apart and stuff, but occasionally he's mentioned, and I get this twisting feeling in my stomach. 

I don't feel like I should have to chase this guy down for... what? I don't even know what I want, an apology? Closure? Something! At least recognition of what happened? I didn't even get to say ""fuck you"" to his face or anything.

The break up pushed me to go to therapy, and I've been seeing both a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist for while, trying to resolve my issues from before and after my ex. But clearly, it's not enough, because just thinking about this guy being in the same city as me, just makes me sick. 

Beyond ""just getting over it,"" what can I do, Reddit? My friends tend to think of me as a very resilient person, but this is something that I know is eating away at me, and keeping me from moving on.

I've just come out of a great relationship with a guy (also 21), it was an amicable ending, with the view of trying again in an undefined amount of time, but that's another story. During this relationship and the period following the break up I learnt that I have a few issues that I need to address, I'm not sure how to go about it. I will try to give examples where I can. 

Little bit of background that may or may not be relevant:

- I am at university 5 hours away from my hometown, graduating in July.

- I have never lived with an SO as I currently live with my parents when I'm at home. Before uni I was (IMO) too young to move out. When I graduate I would like to move out.

- I am not ready for engagement/marriage or kids (although with engagement perhaps I jut haven't found the right person).

- At school I was part of a decent sized circle of friends, but only had one or two close friends. I currently have four friends that I share almost everything with. I have always found it difficult to open up to people but I have been working on this :)

- I was cheated on several times in my first serious relationship.

- In my second serious relationship my SO would ignore me for a few days and then break up with me for no apparent reason. This happened a few times in our 2.5yrs together before I finally ended it.


Also some perspective on how much of a problem these things are might be really helpful :)

**My problems (IMO):**
I have gotten used to talking to an SO quite a lot (I mean almost constant texting unless we're asleep, I do realise this is unhealthy) and I am paranoid that when they stop talking to me for however long it's because they are either with someone else (cheating) or are going to break up with me. 


How do I stop feeling like I need to be in constant contact with my SO? And how do I beat the paranoia?

Thanks for whatever you have to offer me :) I can supply more info if it's needed

I am a virgin who wants to have sex, hasn't fooled around with many women, I have only had 2 girlfriends including her, she is also the 2nd girl I have done sexual activities with, I am a kind of guy who has a lot of moral values and doesn’t like the idea of whoring around, and my ex is an ideal girl for me in many ways.

About a month after I broke up with her I realized that I want another chance with her so we have a friends with benefits thing for a little bit, but then she told me that during the time we weren’t talking she has grown feelings for one of her good guy friends, and this crushed me and tore me up inside. During this time her parents were going through a divorce as well as our break up, which was causing her some serious emotional problems. The friends with benefits time lasted for 2-3 months and during this she turned into a monster, she didn’t care that I was dying inside from the other guy(she wouldn’t try to get over him even though I begged her everyday to just let it go) , she treated me like crap, and really showed no feelings of care or love. This caused me a lot of emotional pain and really makes me wonder if she is actually a good person. We agreed on a break that would last for about 6-9 months shortly after this horrible period, She is apparently finally changing all of that, and will actually treat me well, make an effort in the relationship, adapt to me and my needs as I have done for her.

The problem is I know I still have some feelings for her (not a lot, but enough that it affects me), so I should not allow myself to be her friend.  But it's really hard to just cut this all out.  

I work out, eat healthy, am in good shape and otherwise think I'm a pretty funny guy.  My friends think I'm well-spoken and smart.  I can act confident, but I feel hollow inside sometimes.  I know I'm not a great-looking guy and on the shorter side height-wise.  I can't change that, but I know not winning the genetic lottery in some categories has been a disadvantage.  But even with advantages, I never feel like I'm good enough, smart enough, or cool enough for a significant other, due to the experiences I've had.

Ok, Reddit, here's the deal. Normally I'm fine with [Internet Site]'s English skills and stuff. I tend to go grammar nazi every so often with homophones, ect. You know, stuff that a High School graduate should know. About a month and a half ago, I started dating this guy who could not spell to save his life. I promptly broke up with him, because he misspelled at least one word in every sentence. If we were having a conversation, he'd misspell the word repeatedly even if I'd spell it correctly in a text. A good example:

&gt;Him: What are u doing?

&gt;Me: I'm in church. You said to text you ASAP because it was important.

&gt;Him: Arnt u sappost to be paying attention? 

&gt;Me: I am supposed to be paying attention. You said it was important!

&gt;Him: ur sapposed to pay attention axcept ur tking to me.

Ect, ect, ect. I think the thing that made me snap is that he was so particular about how his name was spelled (it had an s instead of a c, as is traditional for his name), but when I got my dog Rufus, he kept calling it Ruffes. When I called him out on it, he just said ""u no spelling is my bad suit"". 

So, fast forward to today. I'm roaming the internet (Reddit, Amazon, eBay, ect.) and I'm seeing horrendous grammar EVERYWHERE. Tenses are missing, plurals are missing, ect. Usually I'm fine with one or two mistakes but browsing around today makes me want to punch a hole in my screen.

I feel what I want is a contradiction because even though I long to meet people that understand me or I can be close to, I feel empty inside when I do go out with people. 

It's strange, once I begin to get to know a person and become friendly with them, they show signs that make me believe they have ulterior motives.

Its getting on my nerves a lot, girls being what I consider if they were my girlfriends to be unfaithful.

First off is a manager at work, she runs the team I'm in and I've always looked up to her as nothing different. She has a boyfriend of 6 years or so but the other day for some work reason I had to give her my number and things have gone from there. She texts me a fair amount (I ignore a some of them), but its all flirting, offering 'favours ;)' and seemingly leading me one. Not biting.

Girl 2 is a girl who I've actually been wild about since the day I met her, I never got the guts to ask her out and now she has a fiance (happened within months). I'm perfectly happy to let it drop but as I have to see her at work practically every day, and shes not going to drop it, its actually a massive long tease. Problem is is during a drunken moment I told her exactly how I felt by email, her boyfriend read it and shes no longer allowed to talk to me. Its stopped all contact except that at work (the other day she grabbed my crotch + other similar incidents). She doesn't let it go and it kills me but I no longer have any way of sitting her down and talking to her. What makes it harder is I know shes unhappy, or from what shes told me, problem is is the family love the guy so shes just sticking around and staying with him. But that could al be just talk.

Girl 3, has been my longest friend, about 8 years. I turned her down 8 years ago and regret it ever since, we're just friends, and thats all her and I know it'll ever be but her boyfriend watches over our relationship like a hawk! Its just another one to add to the list :(.

And finally my American friend. I was planning to go see her this year and see if we could maybe start something. We've been friends 2 years or so? She's gorgeous and when we both get the chance to talk we talk for hours. **This is what triggered me to post this thread, SHE just got a boyfriend a bit out of the blue really, a massive kick in the stomach, I don't know if to take my holiday (next year) to see her anymore :(.** I'm scared shes just going to be another one of them, I don't want to get in the way of them or cause any issues as I seemingly have a habit of doing. At the same time as a really good friend of mine I don't just want to destroy months of planning to meet each other! Yes I guess I do have a motive behind seeing her rather than just meeting her as a friend, but a boyfriend over seeing a visit, I can't help but feel it'll ruin it?

Quick bit of back ground. I was dating a different girl (over a year ago), taking her out, flirting, all that good stuff etc, it was all going brilliantly, I really liked her, she was single. All was ok. She then got a boyfriend, when I confronted her about it she claimed she didn't know I felt anything for her, broke up with her boyfriend and got with me. I still feel bad about it to this day although he knew I was seeing her, and I knew she was seeing him but not to what extent. 

Things just seem to be spiraling out of control since. I want an honest faithful girl I know I'm not going to find with the ones who flirt while they're in a relationship. I'm trying to resist urges to not flirt but with girl 2 and being head over heels for her its a struggle.

What I mean by this is that I've had several friends tell me that they don't want to be my friend anymore, generally in the same format as your typical break up speech (only minus the ""we can still be friends"" part, obviously).
I've had maybe three or four of these that I can remember as being particularly traumatic. Maybe there are more that I can't remember.
I guess I'm just wondering if this is something that happens to other people too. I'm trying to figure out why this keeps happening to me. I mean, I'm not unlovable, or so people tell me. But it's hard to remember that when so many people I loved have cut themselves off from me.

edit:

So the first time this happened was when I was 14 or something, and one of my best friends decided I was too childish, and said he didn't really want to be friends anymore. He and my boyfriend sort of simultaneously broke up with me.

Second time was rather complicated, involving a friends+ relationship being downgraded to a friends only, because she was feeling bad about her long-distance relationship. Again very complicated, although it sorted itself out.

And third was my best friend from highschool, who admittedly I had a rocky relationship with. We had a big falling out a few years ago, started being friends again, had some good phone convos a few months ago, and now she's told me that she just doesn't see me as a friend anymore. I mean, admittedly we don't hang out that often, we go to different schools. But I guess I thought we could still be friends.

I feel like there's one I'm missing... oh right, London. But I guess that counts as a regular break up, since we were basically a couple, minus the actual commitment.

I don't need to be told that ""People change, things happen, you just have to move on"". I just want to know if this is a rare occurrence or not.

edit 2:

The vibe that I'm getting is that it's a strange thing to have friends give break up speeches. I mostly did the post because I was hoping someone else would be like ""Oh yeah, that happened to me too"" or ""That's not that uncommon"". But based on people's responses, which are mostly asking about the specific details, it seems like this is an oddity. 

I did the post because I felt alone and rejected. I was hoping to find some other people who felt a similar way, not people trying to diagnose me.

However, my love life is going nowhere.

But I'm a coward with women and I really hate myself for it.

**The trigger**

Yesterday (saturday) I was at a club with some friends. The DJ played my favorite music and I was having a great time.

I saw some cute girls, but I was too chicken do actually do anything. I got in a really bad mood because of that, and went home.

When I walked home, it hit me: I hate myself for being a coward with girls.

**History**

Last friday, I met some old friends from high school at a party. This very special girl was there, you could say she's ""the one that got away"". I was really into her back then, but due to previous issues I screwed it up by not acting.

""The one that got away"" and I were pretty drunk, and she said that while in high school, she had decided to marry either me or a common friend. But that she gave up because I didn't want her. I really wanted her back then, and I guess I still want her. That was 2001-2002.

God, I feel so stupid now, even ten years later. She's with some other guy now and she thinks they will get married. Damn.

Then, in 2005, I meet another girl who I fall madly in love with. I'm a coward again and I don't act.

In 2010, a friend's sister starts hitting on me. I like her too, but I don't act. It falls apart because I can't bring myself to show how I feel.

Dear reddit, these are just a few of the times I've been too afraid to act, and lost some amazing opportunities.

**The downward spiral**

I'm constantly told that women want *real men*. Real men who have the courage to ask a girl out, to kiss her and to seduce her. If that is what makes a man, I am not a man. Not worthy of being with a woman, and not worthy of love.

The downward spiral is set, and has been turned so far that I can't see how to reverse it.

**TL;DR: I'm a coward with women and hate myself for it, which means I'm not a real man and thus not worthy. Downward spiral is set.**

Length of relationship 1: A year, a month and three days. Relationship 2: Ongoing relationship, one year, two months, 3 days, and still continuing. I'm sorry about this. I am the world’s worst writer, but the guy of relationship #2 suggested I do this. It'll be long and hopefully interesting enough to get advice out of.

Background: 4 years ago, when i was 12, I met who would later be the first real love of my life. We were best friends for a year, even though people thought he was a dick, I never saw it. On December 5, 2008, when i was 13, we took it a step forward: we started dating. He was the most amazing person I had ever met. He knew everything about me, my depression disorder, my anxiety disorder, being verbally abused. Everything. After dating for 10 months, I gave my virginity to him on October 27, i was 13. I loved him. He wanted to marry me and I promised him I would. He was my everything. He took care of me better than my own family did. But I messed everything up, I kissed other guys. For almost no reason at all, I wasn't unhappy.. Nothing was wrong, I literally had no idea what my problem was. He stayed with me though. He loved me and gave me everything a girl my age would need. But then on January 8th, he left me, after 13 months and 3 days, and then my life started spiraling out of control until i met the guy of relationship #2.

TL;DR had a boyfriend, loved him, cheated, he left.

After he left I experienced the worst 10 months of my life. I cried every night. I had anxiety attacks that were so bad I would hyperventilate and pass out or get sick, or both. Generally both. My family didn’t care or notice so they didn’t help. The only person that ever helped me was my only best friend. I stopped eating. I cut myself. I wanted someone to love me and take care of me because I couldn’t take care of myself. A few days after he left me I found out I was pregnant. I had been pregnant for almost three months. I didn’t tell my parents because I would have been kicked out of my house. But when I told my ex he acted like he didn’t care, he told me to get an abortion. So I looked to my best friend’s mom. She got my a pregnancy test and it was confirmed what i feared, I was pregnant. One week later I woke up and my bed was covered in blood. I lost the last part of him I had, our baby. That was it, I was done.

TL;DR life sucked, no eating, no sleeping, cutting, pregnant had a miscarriage

I had two unsuccessful attempts at killing myself. They were obviously unsuccessful because I woke up the next morning both times. In March my grandpa died, my grandpa and I were like best friends. A week after my grandpa died I had a guy friend over that had been taking care of me recently that I had been friends with for a year or so. He wanted to kiss me so I kissed him, whatever, no big deal. Then he wanted to have sex with me and I said no. Apparently no was the wrong answer. Long story short, he forced himself on me and I was raped.I was 14.

Ever since my boyfriend left me he wouldn’t talk to me. At all. He would tell me to leave him alone and stop talking to him, when all I needed was him and I could never get him to understand that I needed him here. That I loved him and I would do anything to have him back. But he persisted in treating me like crap until I gave up 8 months later. I tried moving on, I tried liking other guys. Every guy I liked didn’t like me or want me. Every guy that liked me was a stalkerish freak. In july of 2010, I met a guy in marching band, he was great. Tall, athletic, super super smart, sweet, nice, caring, everything I wanted and needed. I was amazed that he even talked to me. I had no hope for him even liking me because I never thought anyone would like me again. Until the day he told me that he liked me. But of course there was always the problem with the one guy that I liked that liked me. He had been having sex with the girl he had lost his virginity too who was his friend for over 3 years. Anyways, she was 'pregnant', she had been known to lie about being pregnant in the past, and he didn’t want it to affect us..He liked me a lot and he wanted to date me, he just thought her being pregnant would ruin everything. I told him I liked him too and she wouldn’t get in the way of us dating, if she had the baby, we would deal with it then. She had a miscarriage and she disappeared from our relationship. Forever.

After dating for about a week, he started to realize that I had major problems. I was like a dead person walking, I was hollow on the inside and I wasn’t a happy person at all. But he didn’t care, and he wanted to help me and love me through it. In his words, ""When you smiled, your face lit up and you were so beautiful, and I knew that at that moment, I wanted to make you smile as much as possible"" And that’s what he did, I cried constantly and he would hold me and tell me everything was going to be okay. And that’s all I ever wanted. After a month I started shedding my depression and gaining happiness because he was so caring and amazing. He can always make me smile and cheer me up, even now. After dating for two months, i was 15, we had sex and it was like nothing I had ever felt before, it was real, it was making love. Our relationship was great, it was fun, I could be myself with him, I didn’t have to hide anything, and he loves me for who I am. I told him everything. He was the first person I told that I was raped, the first person that accepted me when i told him I was bi sexual, i told guy #1 and he didn't like it.. at all.. But guy #2 just loved me for who i was, he never judged me on anything i told him. I knew that i wanted to be with this guy for the rest of my natural life, he felt the same but he never actually told me until recently.

TL;DR Met a second guy, infinitely better than the first guy, had a real relationship, actually made love for the first time in my life

A few months ago everything changed, the guy I was telling you guys about, all the way at the beginning of my story, he came back into my life. For some ungodly reason he randomly decided to come back. At the peak of my happiness. Everything from then until now is a complete blur in my mind, but I will do my best.

At first it was just talking, wondering how I am, how my boyfriend is, if I’m happy. Then it turned into, I miss you, I love you, I need you, I’m unhappy, please take me back. That’s when my emotions started to plummet, all of the good emotions guy #2 got me to show were sucked out by guy #1. He just took them away when he came back. But the bad part is I would tell my boyfriend that I didn’t miss guy #1 and that I didn’t love him anymore. It was all a complete and utter lie. I loved him so much and I missed him more than anything. So I did what any logical person would do, and probably the worst thing possible, I told him that I loved him and needed him too. From then on we would text everyday, I would hide him from my boyfriend.

About a month ago it hit rock bottom. I was depressed 24/7, people were noticing, I wouldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep. I was a mess. And it was all because my ex came back into my life and hollowed me out again. But I didn’t realize that because there was nothing I wanted more than for him to come back to me and actually want me. So I just dealt with it. Then my boyfriend found out that I had been talking to him and all this stuff and I needed to make a decision. So I chose my boyfriend but I never stopped talking to my ex, even though i told my boyfriend that i did. My ex would compliment me every day and tell me that he needed me and loved me and I let him because I felt the exact same way. When I would confront him about the way he acted when he left he said it was because he wanted me to move on and the only way he could get me to move on and be happy with someone else is by acting like he didn’t want me. He left me because he thought I wasn’t happy. I ruined my relationship with him.. and I love him so much.

My boyfriend found out again that I was still talking to him and I had to make a decision between them and I chose my boyfriend again. I tried to stop talking to my ex but it didn’t work, I couldn’t let him go again, I had to atleast be able to talk to him. So I kept sneaking around, my depression got worse, my boyfriend noticed and my ex noticed. But my boyfriend got fed up with it, he got sick of taking care of me because I was so depressed and he didn’t know why and i didn't respond to anything he did. At one point he was so frustrated that i wasn't responding to him then i would expect him to make me better that he told me that It wasn’t his job to make me feel better. So my ex came over and took care of me because my boyfriend wouldn’t and I was so depressed and miserable I couldn’t stop crying. He came over and hugged me while I cried and took care of me. Then we kissed. A kiss I had forgotten how it felt and it was amazing, it was just like when i kissed guy #2. Then I knew I could never let go of him again Someone I had been telling every thing about me and my ex to told someone that told my boyfriend. So I had to tell my boyfriend everything about how I felt about my ex, about how much I loved him and how I literally couldn’t leave him ever again. Then I really had to finally choose who I wanted to be with because I couldn’t keep doing this to myself, or either of them. They both love me more than anything, but they also hate each other. They have always hated each other. And I had to make the hardest decision of my life. I became a hollow shell again, I have never been so miserable in my life. But my boyfriend is so awesome about it. He finally told me things he had never told me before in his life about how he felt about me. My ex tell me he loves me and he wants me to pull him out of his misery and be with him. I told them both that I wanted to separate from the both of them so I could clear my mind and choose. But it didn’t work that way. I needed to make a decision within the next two days. A few nights ago I broke down and my boyfriend came over to take care of me. I had the worst anxiety attack of my life. I cried and cried and hyperventilated and passed out, I had tremors while I was sleeping then I would cry in my sleep, for my ex because it was so painful for me to let him go, and my boyfriend just held me and took care of me. But there was no way I could leave my boyfriend that I was in love with. For the past four nights I have been crying in my sleep and having night tremors and anxiety attacks, I cut myself in the shower yesterday just to feel something other than mental pain. The thing is, no one in my family has noticed or they just really don’t care.

I made my decision though.. I chose to stay with my boyfriend. But he told me that I could stay friends with my ex because it was too painful for him to watch me be so miserable without him in my life.. It’s still painful. I feel like I’m never going to have the happiness that i had with guy #2 back in my life because guy #1 is still in my life. I love both of them so much and with all my heart.. and I’ll never get to have anything with my ex again. I’m sorry if the last few paragraphs are vague. Everything from the past two weeks is a complete blur in my mind. All I do now is cry because of the pain. I just cry because I would rather die than leave one of them.

I have a decent amount of friends, but none that I actually enjoy spending lots of time with.  I have guy friends who I do activities with, like running, or basketball, or whatever.  And we talk some about guy things (sports, wives, etc.)

But for some reason I have this yearning to have a female friend that I can talk to about anything and everything.  I guess I'm kind of a guy who wants to have ""girl talk"" with someone.  Just things and emotions that you really can't talk to a guy with.

I currently have 2 female friends that are actually in other parts of the world, so I only interact with them via skype/fb chat.  But 1 of them, I talk to every single day for probably 2-3 hours (off and on while at work) throughout the day.  We skype at least once a week.

I love my wife to death and never seek anything sexual/physical from my female friends.  My wife is somewhat emotionally unavailable due to school and work so I turn to my friends for some things I may talk to her about instead (and some things I just don't want to burden my wife with).

I feel like talking to my female friend that much isn't ""right"" or ""normal"" and I'm not sure what to do.  I have more detail that I'd rather not give over reddit and if there was anyone out there (guy or girl) who could discuss this more with me via messaging I would very very much appreciate some insight into what my yearnings may actually be from.

EDIT1:  Since its going in this direction I want to mention that all of my girl friends have all been in relationships - I just feel safer that way.  I know I won't be doing anything, but I also don't want them to start liking me that way if possible.  Or else the friendship would have to end.

EDIT2:  I really should have made the title ""Married guy who prefers close female friends over male friends"" - Even with a wife, I'm still going to have close friends that I talk to about anything, I just prefer female over male when having these discussions.  I do not feel that I am cheating on my wife emotionally with my friends.  I'm pretty sure I left a lot out of my description here that I assumed was understood.

I had handful of 4-5 friends in high school and never branched out beyond that, mostly because I was terrified of rejection, I assume.

I didn't put nearly enough effort into creating meaningful relationships as I went off to college ~3 years ago, and those high school friends are now gone. I made, again, a handful of friends during my years in the dorm when I got to college and now I live with them, but they are the only friends I have. They all play video games all day, which I certainly don't have a problem with, but what I'm getting at is they aren't exactly helpful when it comes to expanding my social horizons. They never leave the house except for school, so I'm basically on my own when it comes to meeting new people, which leads me to the other problem.

I've always been horrible in social situations, and I just recently got through a messy breakup where I was left for my best friend because I ""wasn't social enough"". This also happened in the period of time where nearly all of my friends decided to stop contacting me. I was basically left alone with my anti-social roommates and without the girl I had become really attached to for 8 months who is now seeing my former best friend. This shook my confidence a bit, and I still haven't really recovered.

It also doesn't help to be actively rejected by everyone you've tried to talk to. I've tried striking up conversations before and after most of my classes. The good conversations have only gotten as far as the talking about the weather for 15 seconds, the bad ones usually involve the person noticing me trying to talk to them and immediately looking away. I've been told I'm attractive, so I assume it's something about my personality that repulses them.

All this, coupled with me losing interest in my major and school in general because of my attitude, is causing some serious problems for me.

So yeah, I guess the point is I feel more alone now than ever before, I have only 2 women total in my life and maybe 4 people I would even consider friends (not even close friends) with absolutely no idea how where to meet anyone else. None of the clubs on my campus interest me, and my campus doesn't do a whole lot of social events. It's a small college in a small town and just about everyone is more interested in going to parties and getting fucked up. Which I'm totally okay with, if I could get invited to those sorts of things.

As a young lad I was diagnosed with ADD, but my mom choose not to put me on medication (A wise choice).  They kept me hard at work and I was naturally smart which helped.

I went of to college and smoked weed which seemed to keep me on task and get my homework done.  It helped me concentrate and not be distracted, I would smoke a little and then get enthralled into my studies  for hours and get everything done.  But as of about 1.5 years ago I quit smoking which feels good to be sober but I can never get anything done now and my school work suffers a lot.  even things I like doing like drawing suffer I can only draw for like 5 min then on to something else and something else forever.  It annoys me but I can't help it at all.  I feel like shit always because I want to do so many things but never seem to do any.

I have tried to schedule my time, tried to take breaks but keep myself on task, but they never work when I don't smoke.

I want to talk to my parents about this but how do I say weed keeps my ADD manageable.  It scares me because I have 15 credits left in school but I know I will fail a few classes because I won't pay attention.

Weed always mellowed me out and kept me on task, which felt good and I helped get my homework done now I don't.

My mom has intense social anxiety or something, she doesn't relax around anyone, she doesn't even relax even around family, her own kids. I don't really know who she is and I don't really think she does either. She's always done what she thinks is the right thing but nothing is genuine...it's more like, she is so afraid to be real about anything, she just always does what she thinks is expected of her, like a hurt little girl.
My dad's really reserved, if he gets emotional he'll just start to get angry and then walk off and when he comes back it didn't happen. He was abused pretty badly as a kid and he's only just started to let it go, fourty years later. He's a little more normal though because he did party a bit when he was younger - enough to fail out of university and never go back. I said to him once, ""mom's crazy"" and he said ""she really is...I'm lucky because she's the only woman crazy enough to love me"" but really he meant that nobody else would love him. He's also really short and hates it, and takes things really personally.
Neither of them have any friends except for the odd one.

When I was living at home I guess I was used to it...the only thing that I noticed was a lack of connection. But now I've been away from home for over a year and seen how happy everyone is and how much is possible and I've worked hard to be way more open and trying to genuinely connect with people, and understand myself more and be genuinely myself. The problem is, now when I'm around them, it hurts. I can tell them anything but it's like talking to a wall, they have no opinion and no advice and they don't care what I do. I TOTALLED a car that didn't belong to me over the summer(not like me), and they took the news like I told them I bought a pack of socks, and had nothing else to say, never brought it up again, didn't tell me off or get disappointed or anything. When they have free time mostly they just watch TV or play cards on the computer or whatever.

So now I'm an adult with attention issues, working through it. I know it's past the point where I can expect them to be my heroes ever. I want to have as good a relationship with them as I can because I know they tried, and it's not their fault that they couldn't help me when I needed them or teach me anything about being happy, it's just how they are, they have their own problems from their own parents. When I cried my mom wouldn't know what to do, she'd just stand there awkwardly and be stressed and watch, and try and ask questions about why, and it would just be worse, so I'd always hide it if I was sad. I've always gotten my life advice from the internet, and when I was old enough I figured out how to get attention/affection from ""nice"" (insecure) guys who would always be there and not expect anything from me and put up with me being moody.

It's just so hard to be around them when I'm trying to break away from everything from when I was growing up. It's exhausting, that's the only word. I don't want any of this anymore. I guess I'm lucky that I had parents that didn't hurt me and bought me christmas presents and would always give me a place to stay now, but I'd rather a mother that would stand up for herself that I could actually fight with and then make up later.

1322260562.0,5,self.ihaveissues,mpab7,I've been in a relationship for way over 13 years and I need to end it but my husband will likely commit suicide...help,Meanorconfused,5,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/mpab7/ive_been_in_a_relationship_for_way_over_13_years/,"I'm 33 and have been with my husband since I was 20 (he's 35). We only married 3 years ago (that's a story in itself). When we were young, things were fine. We didn't have many responsibilities in life, just enjoying things as they came. Over time, I grew up, he didn't. He became more needy, the little things I overlooked started to become a bigger and bigger problem in my life.  

His issues include: (1) Driving erratically, aggressively, not giving pedestrians enough personal space....whey commenting on this he says ""I see them."". This includes a little girl on a tricycle crossing the street with her dad while he inched up his car instead of stopping. This has led to numerous road rage incidents. (2) Anger issues. He always gets made when he's hungry, minor things such as dropping a piece of food on the table, on his shirt, or on his pants. He always apologizes after but it ruins the mood for the evening or afternoon. He could be bipolar but who knows (3) He occasionally smokes MJ which I would probably consider OK but when he does it, it's all about MJ. It's not like he's successful then I can say, ok, use your own money and have fun...instead he uses my money. so this leads to my next one: 

(4). he always takes on big risks. He was in grad school for something that requires a state license. He was convicted at age 18 on a bunch of things but his record got expunged. I do believe he was in the wrong but the cops were probably overly aggressive (the PD has a very bad reputation in this town). I don't think they identified themselves and someone open fired on him and he took off, a chase ensued (no one got hurt). This was related to a gambling/extortion thing....this was about 4 or 5 years before I met him. Anyways, before he started grad school he says he checked with his old PO officer or the county clerk and he could practice in our state, it should be fine. Fast forward to his graduation and he doesn't think he could practice in our state!!!! He instead moves 3 timezones away, gets his license (after months of agonizing over it) and sets up shop. 

Meanwhile all of this is going on, I finish up a 5 year program in grad school, I start my first job in a corporate america, I hit 30, get pregnant, have a beautiful baby, and I'm all alone raising him, of course with the help of HIS family....

I have not been happy for he longest time. The month we get married (we did this at city hall) I wanted to break up with him. I have been trying for years to break up with him but our lives are so interwined and he just doesn't get it. We go on vacation in the beginning of the month and I spent one night in the hotel bathroom crying but somehow we were married at the end of the month?  

I do everything in this relationship, pay all the bills, manage all the bills, make all the adult decisions, make our social life, manage baby's health and dr appts, etc. I feel like I have become more responsible and he hasn't.

So a in July he moves out 3 timezones away and I just started tuning him out, ignoring most calls from him, his text messages, etc. He finally texts me one day asking if I still love him. I told him I sent him an email long time ago and he just chose to ignore it. In it, I told him how I'm too exhausted to deal with this and that I'm done...it was a little long but that was basically it. He promises he'll change and things will get better, etc. He had two chances to make things better and just blew it. One on occasion he gets all pissed off for who knows what and takes the stroller and basically plows through a crowd, running over two peoples feet. 

Well on tues I told him I'm not happy with him, i'm too tired to deal with the added stress and it needs to end. We argue about the same things all the time and nothing gets resolved. He calls me wed asking me about his bank account needing to know his financial state BECAUSE he crashed his car. He went drinking and hit a brick wall. I kind of feel it was a suicide attempt since it was the front end that was smashed, he wasn't wearing his seat belt....he also said to buy life insurance....wtf?

I CANNOT DEAL with all this. I have a son, I'm responsible, I respect other people, I feel like there's no way out and I'm stuck with him. He's like an additional kid. Since he's been gone I feel happy...although stressed because there's a baby in my life, but no added stress. I feel like I have grown up and he hasn't. There are a ton more things to this but this is probably too long already. 

TL;DR: My husband acts like an irresponsible child and I want to leave him but he will probably try to end his life. What should I do?

I'm 18 years old and in a long distance relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half now. Months before him and I started dating he told me about a girl he was madly in love with for years. For the record, he's 22 and she's 21. I never really had a problem with it at all.

Then out of nowhere, around July/August I started to feel like the replacement. She and I have a lot of similarities except that she has more common interests with him than I do. He was in love with her for about six years, but she never felt the same about him so they never actually dated. But they're very good friends. 

I started to feel like he was only with me simply because she turned him down and I was just the back up until the day she changes her mind. But feeling like that wasn't even a big problem because I was able to quickly disprove those thoughts. 

But then the two of them made a sim relationship. I don't know why that bothered me so much. It's just a game, after all. And they are very good friends. When I first found out I was pretty upset and told him I felt like he was cheating on me and that he still had emotions for her. He spent hours after that explaining why he doesn't have romantic feelings about her and why he loves me. As far as I know he stopped playing the game as well. 

But ever since then, I've felt terribly inferior to her. She has much more in common with him. She's much prettier than I am. She can hold down a job, went to college, has tons of friends that love her. And basically all I can ever think about is how horribly I compare to her. I hate the idea of them being friends because I want to be his best female friend. I hate the idea of her even mentioning his name. I hate everything about her but I so badly wish I could be her. 

I had this problem once before but I got over that. And not long after I got over the first jealousy problem, I got jealous of this girl. So I'm sensing a pattern.

I should also mention that I did start to get better for a few weeks. I would listen to happy music any time I had a thought about her and soon my mood would shift from heated jealousy to calm and serene. My goal with that was to associate her with the happy music. It worked for a while; I was even able to have a conversation with her and feel really good about it. But for some reason it hasn't worked much anymore. 

I don't blame my boyfriend or her at all for this. I don't want them to end their friendship. I want to be friends with her too, actually, because she is really nice and interesting. I just can't get over this awful jealousy that I have. 

Is there any way that I can work on this? Also the long distance is really not at all why I'm jealous. I know he's faithful and I see him pretty often. We were together for a while, then I moved away and we decided to stay together.

So basically throughout elementary school and high school I was a complete recluse, totally shy, who could barely speak a word to anyone. Over the summer I vowed to become more outgoing because I was tired of having no friends. 

So anyways I have friends of a sort now, a pretty nerdy group of computer scientists (I am the only girl in the group, and none of my friends are girls, which is also something that worries me). They're fun to hang out with and I like them, but they can get annoying at times because it seems like every conversation they have involve sexual innuendo, and sometimes I get tired of them. Plus one of them keeps making weird flirtatious advances towards me, which makes things pretty awkward. I guess I should look for a new friend group? I do like them but our beliefs about things aren't very compatible and I get really, really, really tired of the same sexual innuendo tossed around all the time.

Speaking of flirts, since I had no friends in high school/elementary school/middle school it follows that I have no experience in dating, kissing, sex etc. So at college I've had plenty of opportunities to experience these, but for some reason I don't really have much of a desire to. Grinding feels artificial and unfun, I never get into it and I just feel bored and apathetic, so eventually I just make some excuse and leave. Maybe I'm not drinking enough? I don't want to end up plastered at parties so I drink a minimal amount. I feel like these are things I should enjoy and in fact should be seeking out like everyone else I know, but it doesn't really interest me as much and I would rather use my time on things I find enjoyable, like for example playing Skyrim or reading books. I went into college with the mindset of changing myself to become less of a shut-in nerd and I'm not sure if I'm not enjoying partying or seeking out sex because I am too much of a shut in nerd or because these things really just don't interest me. Still though, everyone I know is interested in those things so I really end up feeling abnormal, and most people say that people at 18 who haven't been kissed yet usually have some kind of mental issue, so now I'm unsure about the state of my sanity too.

She (22) overwhelmed me with her flirting, really letting me know that she was interested. She's extremely comfortable around guys, very playful and not afraid of being physical. Problem is I wasn't responding properly, being awkward and too self-conscious. I really like what she's doing, it's just I've never experienced it in my 22 years living mostly around guys. Living far away from her doesn't help me build that experience.

Currently:

We still talk a lot, but she shakes my hand instead of hugging me when we meet. She hugs everyone else, but I think my awkwardness makes a hug invalid. I've tried to go for the hug, but she sticks her hand out. She is a little more experienced than me academically, she kind of tutors me sometimes... I think this may be a bit of  a problem since I know girls like confident guys. So I'm trying to figure out how to be more confident while interesting. I have the capacity to do these things, and I'm also a fit guy so I'm not afraid of being physical, I just don't know how. (QUICK NOTE: I have friends who are girls, they hug me because they've known me for a longer time. I'm not too awkward around them because I'm not deeply in love with them).

Tonight:

We talked for a good 2 hours about school and other stuff. I couldn't stop making eye contact with her, she is so damn beautiful in my eyes. Drew a lot of blanks in the conversations and kind of left her empty handed which led her to go talk to someone else. But I could tell she was really disappointed because she wants me to be more interested, and she actually tries hard to push me that way. 

My hopes:

I'm a fast learner, I work hard and I don't care if I have any mental problems, I work through that shit and don't label it as anything. I think the reason I love her and she isn't giving up on me is that we both study the same thing, share the same philosophy on life, it sounds cheesy but we are both attractive and share the same style. The first time we met I could feel a strong connection, it started to fade as I realized how much more experienced she is socially and intellectually. By intellectually I mean she studies more than I do which is embarrassing when we start to talk about specific issues. Anyways, tonight she walked home with some other guy, it isn't too worrying since I know the guy is in another relationship. Problem is he is more interesting socially. In a conversation with her I always let her talk, sometimes when she finishes I'm so lost in her voice, face etc... that nothing much comes out. I feel like I have a ton of personality to offer, just need a way of doing it. I make girls laugh, and I can be romantic, but around this particular lady I freeze. *Guys (or lesbians), think of a brunette version of Scarlett Johansson, smart academically, who is all over you, yet only ready to start a relationship if you open up socially and be able to keep up with her godly sexiness.*

**TL;DR: A girl is very interested in me, I love her but need to find a way to be more interesting socially. Need to find a way to stop being so self-conscious around her and figure out a situation where I can open up to her. If I don't do this soon there are about 5 guys waiting to move in. I got something that they don't which is being genuine, honest, hard working etc... for her. She knows this which is why she's always pushing me to open up to her socially, but I'm finding it difficult without looking stupid. (QUICK NOTE: When I say I love her, I mean it was love at first sight, I can't stop thinking about her, any moment around her is the best thing ever.)**

Let me give you a little bit of background information of me.  

I grew up in Reno, NV and I moved to Seattle, WA in order to get my masters degree in accounting.  I have 4 months away from graduating with my masters degree, and I have a job offer from one of the biggest professional services company in the world, Deloitte.  I am happy in terms of my career, and what I have accomplished, but I am un happy in the other aspects of my life.

I have only had 2 serious girlfriends, one for 1.5 years and the other one for 1 year.  The 1st girl left me because I obviously we didn't get along, we argued about everything, she thought I was cheating on her when I was in China, and etc.  She left in a pretty F'd up way.  She said she couldn't deal with me anymore, and left for another guy.  She then put a restarting order on me, which it didn't hold up in court.  That relationship really messed with me (this was in 2007-20100), and I loss my virginity to her.  

Second girlfriend, I thought I was going to marry her.  She was the one, or so I thought.  We went to Mexico, and things went down hill from that.  We argued where were going to get married at, where we were going to move to, and I felt that she didn't communicate what was on her mind.  I was selfish, and I was a total dick to her, and when we came back from the trip she broke up with me.  This fucked me up more than the last girl.  This happened in May 2011, so pretty recent.

Fast forward until now, 6 months later, I'm still thinking of her.  I know it is not healthy, but I am having a tough time.  I went to go see a psychologist, and I am on Anti-depressents.  I dropped 15 lbs from the breakup, joined a cross fit gym, and was pretty happy for a while.  But just recently, I have fallen back into my little funk.  

Anyways, I need some words of encouragement, because I am defiant having a tough time right now.  Obviously, I have issues.  I went to go see some professionals about  my anger, and my selfishness problem.  I know I am young at 25, but sometimes I feel that I am fucked up beyond the point of helping, and no girl would want to come into my life.

Maybe I learned friendship from bad source.,,7,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/m8wal/18f_i_keep_lashing_out_my_friends_maybe_im/,"I grew up being alone until about middle school. And I was involved in a lot of online fandom. I was in a physically and verbally abusive home, which explains why I chose to obsess over books/tv/movies with a lot of abusive subtext/opportunities in them. I was depressed and suicidal. Still depressed. I think I found beauty and solace in the melo-- violence, abuse. I guess I had to, or otherwise I would've broken a lot earlier.

I'm still involved in those fandoms. I'm sexually aroused by that, even. I go there for kinky erotica with mindfuck and manipulation and dubious consent stuff. Stuff that would never be okay irl. I don't think I want to be the recipient of that, but I might want to do it to someone if they want. As part of a scene/roleplay. Only if they want. I enjoy having power over others. Maybe that's why I lash out at my friends. More about that later.

But I'm not sure if my relationship outlook/patterns are okay. I identify with a lot of self-conscious characters. I used to feel like nobody would like me once they knew about who I was-- angry at my parents (with right reason, I think), undocumented (never belonged anywhere, really; but I'm now getting my green card soon, if all goes well), and just wrong in the head (depressed). 

I sometimes wish there was someone to force me to do my work, physically. Hit me, abuse me, make me cry, make me hurt. Maybe it's just what I knew to be caring at home. Maybe I want something familiar.

I sometimes lash out at my friends. I say unkind things. Not mean, but unkind. Like how I would like to be friends until at least college is over. Because friendships aren't limitless. Like how I'm sometimes annoyed by their naivete. Honesty is my policy, but is it for honesty or really to manipulate them into lashing back at me? Maybe I want to test how far I can push until they decide that I'm too high maintenance. Emotional baggage. When drawback outweighs benefits of my friendship. I'm good at being manipulative. I know body language. I'm very sensitive to other peoples' emotions. I had to be, in a home like mine.

It's obvious I have some self-worth issues. I feel like I deserve nothing, that I'm whining over nothing. People tell me that what I'd gone through with my parents and depression is valid. That it's okay to be depressed over it. But I don't really believe them.

Maybe I want my friends to abandon me, because I don't feel like I deserve them. Or maybe I want them to be mean and abusive toward me, because that's familiar.

1.) My parents divorced when I was 12, totally fucking me up, leading to severe, recurring depression, anorexia, and bulimia.

3). My last love basically pureed what was left of my heart with the on-again, off-again cycle, that ended a few months ago with him (FINALLY) saying, ""I love you. But I can't be with you.""

4). Since then I've had casual sex with 2 single guys and 1 married guy. Because of my ""daddy issues,"" I get a crazy high from any approval I get from an older man with any sort of superiority. It's sick, it's wrong, and I know it.

We broke up about a year ago after 2 years together and, while I'm over her in the sense that ""it doesn't hurt anymore"", I still think about her a good bit. This might be incoherent at times so sorry in advance :) 

** (Wall of text, TL;DR at the bottom) **

My ex was stunning. A knock-out 10/10 in looks, body, brains - every department basically. But since we broke up (long story, too long a distance), I've never been able to meet anybody who comes close to her at all.

She was my first girlfriend. I've had ONS before I met her but I'd never had a girlfriend through a combination of me being shy and not really bothered with any of the girls I'd met before her. She was different though, and it also helped hugely that she took initiative a lot of the time as I probably wouldn't have since I'm more or less brain dead when it comes to girls.

I've met other girls since we broke up, but they never make me feel the same as I did when I was with her. And, truth be told, I'm not really attracted to them like I was my ex. I'm probably going to come across as an asshole here but I've probably only seen one or two girls max who even come close to her in terms of attractiveness. I try not focus on looks alone but I'll be honest and say that they do play a big part for me.

I don't know why but with the girls I'm attracted to, I automatically assume they have no interest in me at all. I don't know why but I freeze up when I meet them. It's not like I'm an ugly guy either - I've been told I'm quite good looking and I believe it for the most part but when I meet these girls I automatically assume they think I'm hideous. The type of girls I'm talking about are the ones who are ""hot and they know it"" - self confident basically. It's probably a recipe for disaster going after them but since I don't really ""go after them"", I wouldn't know. 

I know I sound like I'm putting a huge emphasis on looks here but I'm talking about the initial attraction stage where looks do play a part. I wouldn't tolerate a complete b*tch just because she was hot as hell, I have a bit more self-respect than that.

**TL;DR** I suppose what I'm trying to say is that the girls I end up with are the ones I'm not super attracted to - and I end up comparing them to my ex all the time whereas I go brain dead around the girls I am super attracted to. I imagine I would compare them to my ex as well if I got anywhere with them but I haven't so I don't know.

If any of you have any stories about how you made a transition into your first relationship, serendipitous happenstance that lead you to one, or what I should do, that would be great. Especially if you're somebody like me. Read on if you're curious.

I'm a heavily inexperienced 24 year old guy, who's only been on dates with a a handful of women my age from online dating. My intentions being good hearted, looking for somebody special. I haven't found such a person yet but I'm worried that my life is just not cut out for such a find at the moment, because my life is easy going and uneventful. I've lost interest in the online dating process and the general search for meeting somebody. ""you know what...fuck it."" Skyrim is out this friday, sort of thing.

There has been conciderable personal growth on my part throughout this year. I've grown past most social anxieties, I'm confident in who I am and I'm way more physically fit and style concious than ever before. I'm a strapping young lad, who might not be the most attractive guy around but my personality makes me stand out if I chose to do so. Things are going well but theres always room to improve. Such as how I live my life.

The way I live my day to day doesn't put me in a position where I meet women all that often. I know I'd have to change that if I wished to meet women more. Although that's against the grain of my personality. I'm an introvert for the most part, I enjoy socializing as much as the next guy but a night out will drain my battery and I'll need evenings by myself to recharge. My friday nights are usually spent playing video games and I enjoy it. I don't have a problem with that, I'm happy. However, I feel like I have to be Mr. Excitement and adventure to get the type of woman I want. Yet I'm not interested in being that kind of guy. So I worry that if I continue living the way I do, I'll end up being exactly like this guy. I already am except for the age difference.

I'm young so there's still a ways to go. Perhaps I'm making excuses, putting off the jump into the dating pool. Perhaps I feel like I should already be in a relationship at my age. I'm sure you'll say I need to turn off the video games and make serious effort into finding somebody if that's what I really want. If life were perfect, I'd live how I'd want and somehow that amazing woman will come by and something clicks. However, life isn't perfect and it favours the bold, doesn't it?

By typing out my mindset, I already see what my problem is. I want results with no work put into it.

I like to blame it on my looks and other things, but my singledom is mostly my fault. I've had many chances, some of which I think I would have enjoyed if I could have gotten over my issue. You see, for some reason physical intimacy never appeals to me. Aside from the moments before I'm falling asleep when I think it might be nice to cuddle, I never really desire to kiss people or be physically close to them in a romantic way. 


I had some very little kisses from guys in middle/high school, but when I made out a bit with this guy in college I was seriously grossed out. He stuck his tongue down my throat and had super bad breath and overall it was just not enjoyable, what with in between these sloppy kisses he was telling me how much he liked me even though he'd known me for like.. five days of indirect contact. After that I was never interested in seeking any sort of kissing or whatever from guys. I've still had my fair share of crushes and attraction to people, but when it comes down to it I'm not interested past the initial stage where I dream and hope. 


Even now I wouldn't say I'm coming here because I want to be in relationships but can't; I'm more asking because I feel like something is wrong.

2. I meet her there, we talk, but other friends talk over us and she loses interest after I stay silent for a good hour because I can't think of anything to say. As I sit there awkwardly trying to think of something interesting to say, I notice she's already talking to one of her friends. My mind at this point is telling me ""get the fuck out before you look like an idiot"", but I refuse to leave, I quickly jump into her friends conversation and amazingly make both of them laugh after saying something interesting.

3. Then we all decide to go to her house for more drinking after the bar. Another conversation circle is made, she sits right beside me but I pretend like I'm listening to the other guys talk as not to look desperate for her attention (huge mistake). It doesn't work, she stands up immediately and leaves (obviously she was there waiting for me to say something instead of listening to her friends).

I probably should have stood up and went after her. But Honestly I have no idea on how to approach women. It's pretty embarrassing for my age (22 male), I can make friendly conversation, but I can't properly flirt with a girl. I can't talk to her in a way that she would feel more deeply interested rather than small talk. 

So after that point I basically decide to leave the house because I couldn't think of anything else to say, I was panicking since I was the only one who wasn't talking at the party... I couldn't think of much to say because she's a 'seasoned' person. She reads a lot more than I do, and hasn't been in front of a computer screen as much as I have.

However, I've recently noticed that these coping mechanisms have all almagamated into a general apathy that is bleeding into areas I really should be caring about and a little voice in my head is screaming for change.  I believe this issue arises from several factors
-my somewhat traumatic social life in elementary school
-lack of day-to-day interaction with girls in high school due to going to an all-male school
-being led on by girls more times that I can count
-The schism between the physical form I'm attracted to and the general values and intelligence that I'm looking for in a partner (in other words, I'm too picky and unable to compromise in looks or personality)
-A general disgust with my college education and the college social life (I'm completely straightedge)
-College friends share few of my personal values, so I've been hanging out with them less and less, leaving me with basically no one but my family

I have been without any type of friend, even on a superficial acquaintance level, since I graduated from high school. I might get a chat sessions on facebook once or twice a month, but that's usually the entirety of interaction I get outside of small talk at school.

I came close a few times, and two people even added me on facebook, but I am still unable to connect with them on a meaningful level. Usually either temperament or interests do not match up when I meet people, and I have always been considered strange.

Issues I have worked on this past year have been:

Small talk - I don't seem to hit off very well with others. I went from maybe a 2/10 to a 4/10. In general, I have better discussions with older individuals than people my own age.

Expression - I usually look upset or angry as my neutral expression. I cannot create a smile very well, but I went from a 2/10 to about a 5/10.

Appearance - I went from a 2/10 to maybe a 3-4/10. I hope by losing weight and learning to put on makeup I might one day be a 7. Prettier people tend to get more positive attention, and I feel I need that positive initial impression in my interactions.

But, I am still not there. I really need help on how to proceed. It feels like I am stranded inside a small, box prison and the rest of humanity is living out in the world. I hope things will change for the better when I transfer  to University, as there will be more people and more options for activities related to my interests, and stability in the student body. When someone you met is about to transfer, it can be difficult to befriend them, especially when you live outside the city in a rural area, cannot text, and have limited internet.

How do I get a handle on this?,TA571844,6,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/lcwfx/i_am_entirely_oversensitive_and_overemotional_how/,"*TL;DR - I overreact to everything and I care way too much about things. Enough that it interferes with my relationships: platonic, romantic, professional, or otherwise. I'd like to know how to get through the day without being an emotional wreck.*

---

I have several issues I'm trying to work through, but I'd like to try and choose one specific one to inquire about here. I have tried to sectionalize things for ease of reading and you'll probably be able to skim through some of the sections and still get a good idea of things.

**About Me**

I am a guy in my mid-twenties. I would consider myself physically attractive, intelligent, and nice. However I would also consider myself socially and emotionally immature. I spend most of my time in solitude and find almost all social interaction unpleasant and prefer to avoid it.

I have recently become aware of some issues after starting to hang out with a friend from college and their group of friends. (I was blissfully unaware prior to this I can only assume.) I find myself becoming extremely emotional over things that might normally cause some emotional reaction, but I take it over the top. I take something that happens to me that might make a normal person disappointed, frustrated, or angry and become depressed or upset enough to disrupt my daily life and relationships.

**Frustration**

When I have difficulty completing something at work or school that I should have no problem with or that others complete easily I become infuriated with myself and wallow in self-turmoil. This only serves to make it more difficult to do the thing I'm struggling at. I know there's a specific reason I'm feeling frustrated, but I also know that I shouldn't react that strongly. It's very consuming and difficult to control.

**Anger**

Whenever someone disagrees with me in the smallest way I become extremely offended. It could be anything from questioning my interpretation of a game rule to why I did something a certain way at work. Sometimes they are correct, and sometimes they are not. I'm not sure which situation is worse.

I don't usually boil over outwardly-noticeably; I tend to just freeze up and close myself off and then become furious later when I'm alone and have time to think about the situation. At that point I convince myself I should have actually raised a fuss and told them off, not that I could ever manage that with my lack of interpersonal skills. And then I'm not only angry about what they did, but angry at myself for not doing anything about it.

**Sadness**

I don't do much socially, but I have one friend that regularly invites me to things. This is actually the first time in my life I've had a group of friends with which to spend my free time. Every once in awhile plans with this person will fall through and I'll be crushed. Sometimes this person has an understandable reason to not want to do anything, and when they share this with me I immediately feel better. But when I don't know why they chose not to hang out with me I become very depressed to the point that I will break down and cry. (Not in front of them obviously, but once I get into my car or once I get home.)

It may be a bit of a self-esteem issue, but mostly I just look forward to spending time with this person it's such a huge let-down when it doesn't pan out. I feel very guilty about feeling this way and I would never want to have my friends feel compelled to do things with me because the alternative would send me head-first into a pit of depression.

**What can I do?**

After a few hours (or at the worst, after I wake up the next day) these feelings fade, but while they exist they are extremely powerful. I feel like I am a little kid always crying, whining, and throwing fits when everyone else has to deal with the same things yet they handle it so much better.

It's important to note that I almost never let others onto this. They may notice from my body language that I'm generally upset, but I don't act it out in public. Only a few times have I revealed my feelings to a friend or family member and they did not find it appropriate and considered it very abnormal. I'm sure I probably have some passive-aggressive tendencies because of all this. I'd prefer to be very direct, but with the reactions I've gotten from people close to me, it seems like the direct approach is worse. I can't complain to someone, but complaining to someone is the only way I can feel better.

Overall I would say I have the appropriate type of reaction to everything, I just happen to take it to an extreme degree. I just want to go through the week with out feeling like the world's ending.

Are there any direct things I can do or work on to try and circumvent these issues of mine? What do you guys think?",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_lcwfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/lcwfx/i_am_entirely_oversensitive_and_overemotional_how/,

Why?,9348934,7,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/lbdcd/33m_have_gf_and_a_crush_why/,"I'm a 33-yr old male currently in what I think is a relatively great 2-year long relationship (my 10th or so), but I'm something of an emotional wreck.  Up until a couple months ago, I felt my gf was the first one that I could envision myself marrying one day.  

I work in a very conservative corporate office environment, and a few years back (e.g. few gf's ago), I noticed one particular lady who caught my eye.  I wasn't aware of anything we had in common, so I didn't bother entertaining a way to break the ice, and simply shrugged it off.  Extremely pleasing to look at, but nothing beyond that.  I figured someone that attractive must definitely be taken, if not already married.  She's ""my type"", whatever that means anymore.

Fast forward to present-day.  By chance, we ended up on the same team, even sitting right across from each other.  Initially, I simply thought it's nice to come to work seeing this attractive colleague.  We now have a small bit of social interaction by virtue of being on the same team, but still not working together on the same projects.

I try to keep my private life separate from my professional life except among very few close work-buddies, therefore very few people know I have a gf outside of work.  And, I've never cheated with anybody at work.

Now, the word on the street is that the attractive colleague is not only single, but others who know both of us have dropped hints that I should give her a try!  

I'm torn in several ways.  First, I have a nice gf.  I was completely infatuated in my earlier relationships, but over time I've taken a more rational approach with choosing more recent gf's, which I feel has seemed to generally work out better for me.  My current relationship has been mostly happy or at least content, although we have our differences (don't all relationships?).  It's been my best relationship, by far.

But now I'm completely obsessed with the idea of trying to ask this attractive lady out, despite my existing relationship.  And with whatever crazy decision I make which may allow me to be able to pursue my office crush, if things don't pan out between me and her, I'm concerned with the fallout in our office.  Also, despite others telling me she's an angel, who knows if our personalities would clash or not.

I've never before pined for someone else while I'm in a relationship.  My ex-roommate had a girlfriend who I'd considered ""my type"" while I was with my exgf, but I never ended up daydreaming what it'd be like to date my roommate's girlfriend.

I've got no problem meeting women, really. I never have. Now that I'm in college, I'll be honest, it's gotten even easier for me to date girls.

I'm always open and honest with the girls I date, telling them that at the moment we're just having fun and that's it. No matter what I try, however, I just can't connect with any of the girls I see.

It's been so hard for me to have an intimate relationship with a girl that I'm not even sure I'm capable of it any more. I haven't dated a girl that I considered to be girlfriend material since I was 16.

I'm not sure what's wrong. I'd never blame the women I see for my inability to see anything more than a booty call in half of them, but after sex, I am consistently feeling like a shell. For the first few months of college it was fun but now it's getting old and I really want to meet someone I can feel something for.

I have a fair amount of money in investments and make a very large salary. I'm afraid I've ruined my relationship with my girlfriend, whom I love and want to marry, because I keep mentioning money issues every few days.

I'm frugal. She would say stingy and selfish. I bet other people would say so too. I put into my 401k and investments (i.e. savings for the future) about 30% of my salary. I have all this money I could access but I don't. And I make excuses like it's there in case something happens and we really need money.

But in the meantime, it means she feels completely burdened by spending any money at all. She tells me she can't enjoy things because she's afraid I will say something about not having enough money later. I say stupid things sometimes, like saying I'm not sure how I will pay for something when it would be extremely easy for me to pay for it. I say I want to spend less each month than what is coming in, which makes sense at face value but because I've saved so much and don't include that 30% savings in the amount 'coming in', there's actually a lot of spendable money each month relative to required expenditures like bills.

I have also said stupid things like ""I feel like you wouldn't marry me without a $X engagement ring"" because I know she wants an $X engagement ring. In other words, I keep saying in one way or another that I think she wouldn't love me without my money. But I know that's not true because I've seen so many ways she has changed to try and save money and help me do that. I could easily make that $X available and buy the ring.

Last night it came up again and I was stupid and instead of realizing I needed to say sorry and stop bothering her I tried to explain what I meant which always goes wrong. Because that's me being defensive and thinking her anger at me will go away if I just explain she shouldn't be angry. That's my habit when there are problems. I try to explain why she shouldn't be angry. When I should be empathizing with her instead.

Things got worse than before, and last time something similar happened I promised her I wouldn't make her feel that way again but I have been without knowing it and then really made it happen last night.

Right now I am very afraid she is going to leave me. I don't think that's really something anyone can help me with, but I think it's important to state because that's my primary fear right now. I haven't slept more than a few hours and I've only eaten a cold can of soup and some watermelon in about 24 hours. I have no appetite.

So my issue is obviously that I have some sort of problem where I instinctually try to avoid spending money even though I can afford to do so. And I say things that imply she is a burden or the cause of my money problems without meaning to or thinking that.

What can I do to make it so I don't place money over her anymore? I know what I'm doing is wrong, and I know what I should be doing. But I habitually or instinctually say and do things that are the opposite. I need do find some way to stop myself from continuing the do this.

So, I finally got her number and invited her to go to a party with some people and she did and we had a lot of fun. I found out she had a boyfriend that goes to some other college and it drove me up the wall. I don't think she knows that I like her, and if she does she has no idea how love drunk I am.

It is a very rare thing for me to have such strong feelings for a girl, and when I do it gets bad. A week ago I went to the hospital because I got so drunk that I blacked out and some people were worried about me. She was with me at the time, but not for when I finally broke down that night (which is good).

1317059923.0,4,self.ihaveissues,ks16d,I think I have problem sabotaging relationships. (23/M),TooMuchBaggage,6,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/ks16d/i_think_i_have_problem_sabotaging_relationships/,"   A little disclaimer before you read this. I know it may come across as whiny or whatever but I've been holding this in for close to 15 years now and I need to get this off my chest because I honestly cannot keep this inside anymore.

A little background for context:

   I had a pretty rough childhood growing up. My dad beat my mom, my mom beat my dad, and often times I found myself in the crosshairs. I've been the hospital to get stitches because I got hit with a frying pan that my mom threw at my dad. Not going to lie it was a rough and violent childhood that had me contemplating running away or just ending it all a few times.
 
   So when I was younger I swore to myself I would never get married because I did not want to turn out like my parents. All went well I was able to separate my school life from my home life and I buried everything inward and no one seemed to notice. Then my senior year in high school rolled around. I ended up falling for a girl, well not just any girl she was one of my best friends I felt I could talk to her about just anything. Unfortunately for me I just played second-fiddle, I was the guy she would come to when her current situation didn't work out. I eventually worked up the courage to tell her how I felt and got told ""Well if I didn't like guy x, you do mean a lot to me though."" I was shattered, heartbroken, and angry. I mean we even made one of those promises to get married if we were both single later on in life. I ended up cutting her out of my life completely (something I deeply regret to this day). So I basically renewed my vow to myself that I never wanted to get married.

   I went off to college and tried to start over. Well my grandmother ending up dying and my parents relationship went to shit and they decided to get divorced. And yes I know I shouldn't really let it affect me (this is what I tell myself at least), but it sent me into a really deep depression. I ended up dropping out of college and I basically cut myself off from the ""real-world""  and I ended up just playing video games, MMOs, or surfing the internet for 16 hours a day and then sleep. I would only leave the house when I absolutely needed to. I did this for about 2 1/2 to 3 years before I got so disgusted with myself and I decided to get my shit straightened out.

   Well that brings me today. I am back in school got my A.A. and I am finishing up my B.S. I have a job that I am happy with. I have my own place and I even reconnected with a few old friends. Here's where my problem re-emerges. I met a girl about 4-5 months ago (we had a class together) and we hit it off and over time became good friends. As I got to know her I found myself liking her more and more. So I eventually worked up the courage to ask her out and she said that she would love too but was just super busy and didn't know when she would have free time. I understood, I mean she did go to school and work 2 jobs, but it all goes downhill from here. 

   So here I am again falling for another friend of mine, that now wants nothing to do with me. After I asked her out its as though all communication stopped. I mean when I do see her around the campus or just run into her around town, she seems friendly and we chat for a little but it always just feels weird and forced. I mean I tried to reach out, I sent a facebook message seeing how she was doing. I even sent a text asking if everything was alright nothing no response. It just fucking sucks to have to lose a friend this way. Now for the past few weeks I have been extremely miserable. I don't know what the fuck I am doing wrong. I've broken down and cried a few times and I have that terrible sinking feeling that everything I've worked so hard to achieve is going to be taken away from me and that I'm going to go back to being the person that I was 2 years ago.

   I just wish I wasn't such a fucking train wreck of a person. I just wish I could stop trusting people who are just going to throw me out like yesterday's trash when I finally open up to them. I just wish there was someone out there who would love me for me, brokenness and all. And wish I would stop sabotaging my relationships with people (I mean the problem is me, right? At least I hope so because at least then its fixable, right?). Sometimes I feel like it is just easier being alone because at least then I wouldn't feel like this, I wouldn't have to deal with rejection, and I wouldn't have to worry about being accepted or loved.

I'm 22. I have a 16 month old son who I raise by myself. His father and I were in an almost 3 year relationship that was messy to say the least. It involved with him lying, emotionally and physically cheating, multiple times, him going to jail, me bailing him out, us living together two separate times, and us finally having not one but two kids and the second one being lost during the first trimester back in January. He left the day after I had the D&amp;C to remove the remainder of the pregnancy. I found him on an online dating site, confronted him and he told me I was too unstable for him.

It was a world wind of a three years but I can honestly say though I have a few scars I am definitely  healed from all the damage... or so I think.

Fast forward to now. I've been on a few dates, met plenty of men who were definitely attracted to me and who could be potentially good mates. But none of them have really caught my eye. The few that have actually caught my interest don't seem to be the ones really interested in me. Or should I say, they start out strong, constant flirting talking and texting, and then it starts to wain off until it stops completely. I wish I knew what I was doing. Maybe I come off a little strong? Maybe they think I'm nuts? Maybe they realize the kid thing is too much? I wish I could fucking tell you.

I'm (23F) in a relationship with a wonderful man (28). We've been together for 2 and a half years and we live together. I'm currently abroad working on a project with a very close male friend of mine. The friend of mine and I have always had a flirty relationship, but completely harmless. My boyfriend knows him well and they get along.

Well last night, the friend and I were watching a film and things got intimate. Details: clothed, made out, and I gave him a handjob. Immediately after he said something to me about not being comfortable with that and he left the room.

I'm feeling really fucked up now because I have no idea why I did it - am I that much of an attention seeking whore? I didn't think I was. My boyfriend doesn't deserve someone like me. I won't tell him about it since it would hurt him more than anything, but I also don't know how to handle the guilt. My boyfriend means everything to me and I wish I could just brush it off, but I can't do that. Plus the friendship with my friend feels completely ruined.

To make things worse we still have 3 more weeks of living together in the foreign country working on the project. The only things said to each other since last night was something along the lines of - this can never happen again. He didn't even seem like he wanted to do that with me. I initiated it. now he's avoiding me and not talking to me.
So.... Anyone been in a similar situation? Is it one of those situations where I have to choose either my boyfriend or my friend? (I would choose my boyfriend of course).

Any advice/encouragement would be good. Please keep it as nice as possible.

Edit: I just talked with the friend and we decided to go with the ""act like it never happened"" approach. Thoughts? Does this actually work?

My mom says that as a very young child, I was quite secure and confident.  Once I started being friends with a few neighbor girls, that I also went to school with, she noticed that started to change.  

Like most girls growing up, I was not immune to mockery or ""harmless"" criticism (""Oh, you have a little fat on you.  No offense!"")  The hardest part, is that they weren't always outright mean; it was usually quite subtle, masked by a fake, smiley exterior.  It was all rather confusing.

By the time we all hit high school, they had made their way into the ""popular"" crowd.  We were still neighbors, so though we weren't the same friends that we were when we were younger, we were still friendly.  

I finally realized when they no longer gave a shit about me, when I called one of them up to offer my condolences when her friend died (we were 15, and I had started homeschool that year, so I didn't interact with them anymore).  The ungrateful tone, and rather rude response (""Uh, sure, okay.  Thanks, I guess.... Okay, bye!"") stung, but I got it.  I didn't contact them again, and moved on.

I'm now 26.  I got bored on FB recently, so I decided to look them up, and take a look at their pages (with no intention of friending them... I don't feel any need or want to).  Like everyone who gets bored and ""facebook stalks"" someone, I was just curious.  I wasn't surprised.  Both are super hot, have degrees, cool careers, are very well traveled, and live in trendy, sought-after cities.

Me: No degree (going to go back to school next Fall, though), does office assistant work (i.e. receptionist), not well traveled (though I did have the opportunity to go to one destination overseas last year... I didn't pay for it though, it was a gift), overweight (though I have lost 30 lbs so far, need to lose another 20-30), not fashionable.  The pluses?  In a 2 year relationship (we live together), he's a great guy.  I only have 1 real friend, but she's a sweet-heart and I'm grateful to have her.

Basically, when I saw how well off these girls are, it made me jealous.  I see what they have, and I want it.  People around me have always told me they thought I was nice, and sweet, and seem genuinely happy for me when something finally goes my way (I feel like people pity me most of the time).  These girls were such bitches, not just to me, but to everyone.  I know life isn't fair, but... fuck.

I am 22 years old and my girlfriend of 1.5 years is 18. I am her first real boyfriend, I myself had two serious relationships prior to her. Two days ago she went to a welcome party for some foreign exchange students to nearby college. She is always trying to improve her Spanish so I always think that these kind of social occasions are good for her. I study at this university (she is at her final year of high school) but that day I have been working late hours so I could not attend. When I returned back from work she im'ed me that she had done something terrible. From what she wrote I learned that there was a boy hitting on her all the evening. When she decided to go home he offered to escort her home, which is 20min walk. She went with him and when they got near her home, as she was saying goodbye and giving a goodbye kiss (uncommon in my country, but she did a lot of travelling to southern europe, where this is perfectly normal and she does this around people from these parts), he, by her own words, stuck his tounge in her mouth. She now feels guilty for flirting with him that night, but she won't speak with me on this matter anymore. She only provided that basic info and speaks of it only with her close friends.
With my own little detective work, I found out that he is local, no exchange student, and I began to feel a lot insecure about her. The more it hurts after I discovered that she shares the whole story with basically every of her classmates but me, but her friends are not so close to me to tell. I am really unsure whether I ever should initiate a conversation on this topic or remain silent. The thing that doesn't add up (to me) is that she lets a boy who is hitting on her to take her home, according to my logic this is just wrong. Am I overreacting? Because I have been treated for neurosis in my early teens and since then I sometimes feel like I am not able to get the big picture (objective angle of view) on some things.

I'm not too good at asking for advice, lol. 

I am a 19 yrold female. I've always been severely insecure about myself, my looks, my personality and how people view me.  I always feel like people are out to get me and are judging me. 
It's gotten really bad that I catch myself staring at myself in the mirror for a good 30 minutes to an hour at most, just picking out little things. I don't have a hint of acne, and if I did I'd probably have a panic attack. These things just make encounters with new people extremely hard.
When I have a conversation with someone, the whole time I'm thinking to myself that they're out to get me, just using any information or anything I say, against me. 

With that said.... I currently live with my boyfriend who is 22. We've been dating for a little over a year. He's the best thing to have happened to me, and has helped with my self-esteem. He is the one exception, being friends with him for a little over 3 yrs. We met at work. But the problem is, our social life's are completely opposite. He has a lot of friends, a few that I can call my own ""friends"", (that I met through him- and only hang out when my boyfriend is present) but that's it. I've never been the type to hold onto a friendship of my own. 

Anyways, he loves to go out to the bars with his friends, staying out all night. I wouldn't mind so much, if I had something to do as well.. Instead I sit in our apartment alone in front of the computer screen.

At first I was okay with it, I didn't mind being alone while he was out, but recently we had a fight and I said something about him always being with his friends, and he retorted ""At least I have friends."" Now I know this is harsh (I can't blame him for having a social life), but it's also made me realize I can't live like this forever. I can't always rely on my SO to be my best friend. 

Who can I turn to when my boyfriend and I get into a fight? Who can I discuss girly things with and spend a day at the spa with? Who can I go shopping with? Who's gonna be my maid of honor and bridesmaids when/if I get married? I have no one. All these things I've recently started thinking about and it's time I've changed things. 

I have been told before by many people I'm attractive, down to earth, and overall cool to hang out with. So why can't I just accept these things, and not think everyone is lying to me? Everyone I seem to start a friendship with, I just can't hold onto. And when this happens, I feel like it's all my fault, and people just don't like me. I know this has to be something I can control, I just can't figure out how to... Any help/tips on how to strengthen my friendships I've left behind, and getting rid of all my insecurities, would be greatly appreciated.

I started seeing this girl in high school, let's call her Beth, and we were very much ""in love"", as in love as you could be at that age I guess. We dated for 3 years and then broke up when we ended up at different colleges. I was always a bit more clingy and prone to missing her so college was a lot harder on me. Beth made friends quick, had a boyfriend the first year whereas I struggled academically and socially. I cut off contact from her then but I cracked. This happened on and off throughout our college careers, mix in a bunch of random hookups + near relationship-again-misses and you've got a recipe for hangup stew. 

I finally got a different girlfriend just out of school and we dated for a few months but she had to leave the country to go to med school. I loved that girl at the time but I knew she was leaving so I think I subconsciously didn't let myself get too attached. She's hung up on me, or at least I think so because I try to avoid talking to her too much but that's a different story. Anyways, that whole time I avoided talking to Beth because it'd almost feel like cheating or something.

A few months after I broke up with the latest girlfriend, I started talking to Beth again and my feelings for her slowly crept back. Slowly at first but she came and visited me a few times and now they're full blown again. I hate having these feelings for her because I know it's just going to cause me grief and I've been through it so many times before and it's just not rational. She left my place this morning and I told her about all my feelings and she was surprised because she thought we were just really good friends with benefits. She said that she hasn't been emotionally attached to me in that way for quite a while.

I just want to be friends with her but I don't think it's really possible because I don't think I'll ever not have feelings for the girl. I know that I should just stop talking to her, cut her out from every aspect from my life but I'm weak-willed. She's my best friend, I talk to her about anything and everything, even when she's my problem. She's my go-to person for advice in all aspects of life and I talk to her the most out of everyone I know, including family. She's the only person I can talk to and actually feel like myself, it's so goddamn cliche but I feel ""whole"" around her. I don't have all that many friends where I live now, especially ones I feel like I can talk to about this so my support web is weak and she's at the goddamn center. I've tried cutting her out of my life before and have failed horribly each time. It's been 5 years and I've still got this issue and I'm starting to hate myself for feeling this way. What the hell can I do? How do I cut out the single most important person in my life?

I've been telling myself over the past few hours that ""she will never love me again"" (hence the title). In the past, I think I may have always harbored some sort of hope that ""we"" were still a possibility and if I keep telling myself that it's completely done, maybe that'll be the closure I need. I don't know if I can maintain this ""resolve"" though.

Please, any and all advice welcome. Tell me I'm an idiot, tell me to grow up, anything.

**EDIT**: Blocked her IM, unfriended her on facebook and removed her number from my phone (though I have it memorized...). I will call her August 30 to say goodbye, I owe that to her because none of this is really any of her fault.

**EDIT #2**: I'm actually feeling really normal all of a sudden...maybe I don't have to unblock her from my life? Maybe I just need to tell her I can't be friends with her anymore? Or maybe my brain's trying to play tricks on me to keep her in my life. 

**EDIT #3**: Yea, my brain's trying to trick me. When I do things so I don't think about her, I go ""hey, i actually don't care that much"" but when I actually think about it, there's no way I can stay friends with her.

Although we've had our ups and downs, all in all it's been a wonderful ride so far. We moved in together about two years ago (man, the adaptation was hard) and in the past six months we've relocated to another city.

The thing is we haven't been doing so great lately... constant bickering, lack of chemistry (not just at a sexual level but even in the small things: hugs, kisses, etc) and overall less time together. We love the city, our new jobs and our flat but I feel the love we feel for each other is fading away. Some days are hard and I end up getting sadder/pissed off when I get home. Everything turns out fine the following day, things normalize, etc, but things rarely pass that point anymore.

On top of that, we've met this girl who is incredibly cute, funny, intense, intelligent but still struggling to move past her ex. She is awesome. I've often found myself looking at her and wondering why can't I live with her instead of my gf. Don't get me wrong, even if she were into me (which she's not, in all likelihood) she would never approach me if it meant hurting my gf. I've thought long and hard and I think it's not her that I'm interested in - better yet, can't be interested in (she's way out of my league) - but on **something new**. I feel we're approaching a new step in my current relationship (kid/no kid, home/no home...) and I don't really know if I want this.

We were together for one year, and then she said she didn't love me anymore, and moved on. I was depressed for about 3 years after that. I don't think I am a socially awkward person, but I have been told so. I am an introvert. If I am around people for too long, I just want to be alone. I work alone. I live alone. In crowds, I tend to just stand back and watch people. I enjoy listening more than talking. When talking, I tend to just ask questions. I know these sound like positive characteristics, but a lot of times I want to be the squeaky wheel. The cool guy with the hot babe, the sports car, and everyone seems to like him. But, mostly, I am content to be myself. I like myself for the most part. I just don't understand why I am the way I am sometimes. I am jealous of my friends, who are all married and all have kids. I want to be that. I want to be a husband and a father. It's just I am deathly afraid of being in a relationship for the rest of my life. Not that I would cheat. But that I wouldn't be free, ever again. There would always be someone in the back of my mind. For the most part, that sounds good, but something inside of me is not wanting it.

I don't want to be alone. I don't like being alone. In fact, the more I am alone, the worse I become. I become entangled in my own made up fantasy world. The more I am alone, the more I start to hate people, and become a hermit. I end up playing way too many video games. I am doing better. I like people. I like hanging out. I just don't know why I have a headache and feel like throwing up, thinking about going on this date. I just don't know if I could be a good person to her. Sometimes I cuss and get angry and bang on my desk and yell. I wouldn't want to be like that around her or my kids. I know that is a long ways down the road, but still, it's something I am afraid of.

Me: A 25 year old male

I have issues. Serious one at least serious mental ones. Have had them for a while but this last 14 months I've hit new lows. I have become a full blown obsessive psycho stalker ex-boyfriend. Hopefully I'm on the tail end of this but it hasn't let up yet and the end isn't in site.

Most of my horrible deeds are in the past. Since I've moved across the country I can no longer be the traditional ""stalker"". In the past however I've sent strings of the-most-horrible-things-I-could-think-of texts. It culminated with me showing up drunk at her house and after she refused to talk to me, I dipped in the shadows and keyed her car.

I've lurked on relationship_advice since the breakup and was horrified comparing how normal people handle breakups to myself. I am the pyscho ex boyfriend you cut contact with and or get a restraining order against (luckily that didn't happen). 

It was never a healthy relationship. I was fine about it for two weeks then I found out she slept with a guy. This started my long journey to mt.crazy.

I didn't know how to handle this. I tried to get back with her. I was somewhat sane then and didn't push it that hard but didn't play my cards right at all. Probably cause I knew deep down it was for the best. Loneliness got the best of me I got needy which pushed her away. She decided we shouldn't talk. I'm hurt I don't know how to express this.

We did talk. Or at least I for godknowswhy reach out and try to be ""friends"". This is painful. Every time I call her about once every two weeks at the peak of my loneliness cycle I call. It's just so sad. She has NO feelings for me  and no real compassion because every phone call is about her recent hookups, how great the guy is....really really shallow shit. Every phone call would be the same I'd sound pathetic and she'd brag about her singleness and promiscuity. She Didn't care how I was/how I was taking this or anything. It was like we never existed as a couple. 

I put myself through this. I have no idea why. I guess I was just really lonely and thought I could get a fraction of compassion or pity or friendliness. I didn't. The whole time I am aware of the cut contact/hit gym/delete facebook method. I didn't follow it. I'm a poster child for not what to do. I am also aware that she owes me nothing. Her attitude though was just so casual and petty. It made me feel like there was no connection to begin with. There where no traces of caring, loving or friendship. She was a stone cold petty stranger. I guess I was cowardly digging for any evidence that the 5 years we spent together meant something or left a imprint on her life in any way. 

Ok If you haven't already down voted me and moved on: back to the present. I am still obsessed about resolving this. I am obsessed with closure that I know I'll never get. I am still obsessed. I obsessively check her sisters and friends profiles. I have an alternate account since she and her boyfriend blocked me to check on there's. I've blocked them, I've tried to resist. I don't. I google the he'll out of her and anyone she's ever hung out with name. It pathetic, it's unhealthy, and self destructive. 

That where I'm at now. If you wanna comment go ahead (I appreciate advice but obviously am hardheaded/insane and can't promise change) anybut I guess I'm mainly just getting this out. I could go on forever about the situation as I've never talked to anyone about it in depth because of the shame and embarrassment I feel. Feel free to attack me also. I deserve it. I'd love to give more details about it if anyone is interested it's complex (maybe not) but there are a lot of other issues.
My question is how do I even start to begin to work out these problems? Thank you for your time.

Tl:dr  I'm still obsessed and cyber-stalking my ex after 14 months.

But it didn't feel like a real relationship looking back on it as never did anything really physical aside from hug, yeah never made out or anything she never seemed interested in doing so.

Years later I still haven't been able to find another girlfriend or even go on a date. I never really seem to meet many girls in the 5 years I've been single since then I've only liked around 4 girls that I've tried to be with and they all ended up in failure. The last girl I met around a week ago through a friend and we seemed to hit it off, but I found out through a friend that all we could be is friends, not sure if it was my fault or what.

I seem to be bad at every step of the way. I'm horrible at meeting girls and even when I meet girls we never seem to hit it off or anything else. Like with the girl I met last week I was too stupid to make any moves despite she was leaning on me and putting her head on my shoulder. I didn't even ask for her number in the end. I'm horrible at approaching people it's hard to imagine approaching someone at random and striking up a conversation let alone getting their number or anything further.

I've always been a person who liked to deal with her problems by herself. I've had bouts of depression, but I eventually got through each one and am trying to learn how to handle myself better every day. 

My previous relationships have not been so great. Nothing to get dramatic about, I was young and blind, and didn't know shit about myself or about relationships, and let them cheat, abuse, control me. I also stopped communicating with my father about 4 years ago when I realized he was emotionally abusive and a negative presence in my life. All of these incidents happened within the same year or two.

I am now in my first serious relationship since that last one. I love him dearly and he makes sure to let me know he loves me too. We've been together for nearly a year and I really have no complaints. My problem here is that because of said previous relationships, I've put up a wall to protect myself and not appear vulnerable. With every day that goes by, it's becoming harder and harder for me to tell him ""I love you,"" as I keep making the wall stronger. I love him so much but I can't get myself to show affection unless I'm reciprocating what he said. It's starting to feel forced. That's not how it should be.

A few days ago, while my boyfriend was showing me something on his phone, he received a couple of texts from his ex. My instant reaction was to look away - I know that if I'm exposed to any type of information that could spur negative thoughts, I'll over-think and become paranoid. It brought back thoughts of my ex controlling everything I did on my phone or online, reading every bit of information that was lying around and deleting things at will out of fear that I was cheating on him. I have an absolute fear of becoming that boy and invading my boyfriend's privacy or reading anything by accident that could set me off and make me insecure. 

This rather benign accident, coupled with stress from work and my family staying over at my tiny apartment, has been bringing back memories of emotional abuse and I can't seem to control the effect they have on me. I am also thinking a lot about my father (who tried to contact me recently) and about negative attitudes of his I can sometimes recognize in myself. My boyfriend has shown (for the first time, I believe) fear that I was thinking of ending it because of my distant behavior, which put things into perspective for me. I am scared shitless, confused, and so lost. 

**TL;DR: I don't know what to do anymore. I put up a wall to keep my loved ones from seeing me as vulnerable and weak, and it's becoming so strong I can't seem to show/express feelings anymore out of fear that I'll come off as needy, desperate, weak, etc. I need help.**

**TL; DR:**  Social anxiety, low self-esteem, depressed, seen too many Apple Jacks commercials (*Why do you like that?  ~~We~~ I just do.*), can't stand up for myself, and I don't know how to talk with people.  Even if I could or when I do, I can't come up with anything to say.  Suggestions?


**I don't know how to talk to people.  Specifically, I don't have anything to say.**  I used to have serve social anxiety, but I've very slowly gotten better.  I still have it, but it mostly just makes me stumble around with my words when talking instead of actively avoiding people.  Someone sitting down next to me still makes me uneasy, but I can keep it under control.  Though, I rarely look people in the eye especially when I'm talking to them.  I'm a master at looking busy when I'm not doing anything so people won't approach or talk to me, even though I want them to.  


**I can't keep a conversation going.  To me, everything is the way it is.**  One artist isn't better than another, they just draw/sing/whatever the way they do.  Stuff isn't good or bad.  I've never looked up to anyone.  Everyone has their good traits and bad traits.  When someone asks me if I like this or that better, I just can't respond.  I can't put up a good defense about my beliefs/positions on topics, so I avoid those types of conversations too.  I'm also extremely bad at remembering names and sometimes people in general.  I know what my family looks like, but I'd struggle trying to describe them to you.  Since I couldn't remember names, I'd have to avoid all conversions about someone as I wouldn't know who we were supposed to be talking about.  I can remember names a little better now, but I still avoid talking about people because now it seems mean to me.  I won't say something about someone to another person unless I had already said it to the subject's face, which of course I hadn't done since I don't talk much.  


**I don't like bothering people** and I take it too far.  I stopped doing sports because I didn't like winning as it means the other team lost and I'd be hurting my own team if I wasn't trying to win.  If someone has super loud music on I just do my best to ignore it while trying to see the best: “What doesn't kill you makes you stronger” or 'This will give me good practice with concentration'.  Really, I just end up not being able to get anything done until that person stops.  It has given me excellent patience, though I don't know at what cost.  I never give complements because then I'd have to complement everyone else in the area too in order to prevent them from feeling left out.  And since everyone is just the way they are, I can't come up with that many complements anyway.  **I also never talk about my interests or skills as it feels like I'm bragging even when I'm not.**  I don't like bragging as it tends to put other people down.  I also belittle my skills and accomplishments as I can see the flaws in everything (can see the good too).


The main talking I do is really stupid wordplay jokes.  As an example someone might ask everyone in earshot “Is that computer on?” and I might reply “Yeah, It's on a table”.  That's a bad example; I can't think of any good ones right now.  I normally regret saying them, but if I don't then I'd never say anything and I have gone full days of not talking during college while surrounded by chattering people.  I stayed in a club at school, just never talked much and everyone eventually ignored me.  A few times I'd be sitting next to someone or across from them and they wouldn't even notice I was there.  Demonstrated by the person asking if anyone knew where I was and other people responding I was right in front of them.  I was never able to get much help with school work.  I've never studied in a group or with another person unless we were forced into groups during class time.  Even then I tended to not be truly part of the group.  


Since I don't talk with anyone, **I don't make any meaningful connections and thus don't have any friends.**  My relationship with my parents is poor too.  I don't talk to my family about anything meaningful and wouldn't want to.  I'm thinking of going back to school for a Master's degree just so I can be around more people and give myself a another chance.  When I started working last year, everyone already had a family or their own group of friends and I just ended up eating lunch at my desk every day. 


**I've been shy since my first memories, but some of it might be due to depression.**  I've sort-of attempted suicide twice before while at college (They were partly designed to fail, but the risks were real.  Maybe more of a cry for help that went unnoticed).  I think if I could make a few friends my depression would get much better, though I'd probably make friends better if I wasn't depressed.  I tired to go in for counseling, but was turned away from two different places.  I hate taking drugs anyway.  I even avoided cold medicine unless I had an exam coming up.  


And if you've noticed in my writing, I tend to avoid absolutes.


If you read all that, thanks and sorry.  I can't believe I wrote this much.  I probably know what I need to do anyway.  One of those things is asking for help, so **any suggestions on how I could start talking to people** or on anything else I've written about?

Since a year or two i have invested myself in living in more serious relationships. I am, however, failing and I'd like your advice.

I am a 30 year old male, living in London. I've had two serious relations that were ended by the women (age: 33 &amp; 29) in question, one lasted three months, the other six months. During all stages of the relationships I've been ridden with anxiety that we are not going where I want to or that she will be leaving me any second. My anxiety is triggered by instances like unanswered texts, strange glances, and lots of other stupid minor things. But mainly, lack of emotional response. I tend to need constant confirmation that they like me. In both relationships most of my worries were unfounded.

Of course this has led to troubles. They retract from me (or so I experience it) and I get more and more filled with resentment, i.e. less attractive. Until it is ended, by them. Both of these women have referred to this issue post-break up.

I also seem to seek out troubled women, or at least prey on the trouble in them. These serious ones both have absent fathers, they have had their share of trouble (depressions) and I cant seem to be a good support for them, even after reading up on how, talking to a shrink about it and thinking about it over and over. Instead of giving support I believe I might cling to their bad fortune as a means to being needed by them. I know this is srsly f-ed up.

I'd like to hear from people who have overcome behavior like these how they did it, or hear this from the perspective of women who has been in relations like these.

I am a 30 year old male, good looking, highly intelligent, good job. Described by friends as ""the most social around"", well liked by many, but also controversial with others. I believe most of my other behavior in my relations is genuinely appreciated by the women, at least they told me so.

When little I had trouble getting girls, I mainly fantasized about how I would court them, telling my friends, but not going with it. During my teens I became the proper man-whore. I have since slept with a too high for comfort number of women, but also spent years as a non(?)-voluntary monk. I've had relationships before, but none that I took serious. I have no inclinations of continuing neither, I want a committed relationship. I am at loss on how to though.

TL;DR My fear of being left by women are killing my relationships and causing me to do bad things. How did you stop? How did you experience this behavior?

I've never had good relationships, first boyfriend of 1 year cheats on our anniversary and ends it the next day. Had a few other really bad experiences. Then, I dated someone who after a few months, raped me. I was raised hardcore catholic, so after that, I was ashamed and miserable, and had very very bad ptsd. I was afraid of guys for almost two years. When I finally decided to try dating again, the new guy I was with dumped me after two weeks because I wouldn't sleep in bed with him. Apparently, I was too messed up. I felt alone and unloved and ended up in the hospital a few weeks later after I thought about killing myself. After I got out, I moved to another city, where I felt even more alone, far away from anyone I used to know. There I found out that the traumatic experience caused a genetic autoimmune disorder to come out of the woodwork. One acquaintance I had left in my old town kept in touch with me, and after hating my new location, I cautiously moved back to finish up school. That acquaintance (guy) and I started talking more and became friends. About a year later, we started dating. For the first time in my life, there was someone who I still believe to this day to be a legitimate, caring, and true person. To this day I still can't believe he's in my life. He constantly reminds me that there are good people in the world. Here's the problem. At the beginning of our relationship, I can't explain why, but I was really physical and promiscuous with him and we had sex. lots of sex. (In hindsight, the only thing I can think of is that I wast taking control of my body... claiming my virginity if you will, after it was stolen). Then, something kindof changed in my head, and that fear of sex and relationships kicked back in. We've been together for almost two years now, and I love him... and I want to be physical with him, but I cant. I just, cant. It's not that I don't want to, I just can't, and I can't explain it or justify it. The guilt simply associated with it is making me cry right now. So, I feel frustrated, guilty and confused all at the same time. To make matters worse, he's starting to get upset himself about all of this. I just, I need your opinions and suggestions and help. I love him, care about him, and want him to be happy, but I don't know how to overcome this huge obstacle in my life... how to make sex ""Ok""/not so scary/fix my lack of sex drive. He's a wonderful person, supported me while I learned how to follow a ridiculous diet thanks to that autoimmune disease I mentioned above, helped me through family problems after what happened, and cares about me. I have enough hardships that I'm not sure our relationship can take much more of his giving without some of my own in return.

1305384692.0,5,self.ihaveissues,hb9aq,"Anyone else ""shut down"" socially?",lignardi,8,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/hb9aq/anyone_else_shut_down_socially/,"So I'm curious and am looking for advice.

Cliffs of me, I'm a 22 year old white college male (I mention my race so as to preface that I'm not an awkward asian computer science major).  Aesthetic wise, I'm not gonna post a picture for obvious reasons but you'd never guess I was socially awkward because I'm roughly 6 foot tall, have a fit build, and I dress fashionably (in a suit my jacket sleeves are just short enough to show a bit of the cuff of my dress shirt); in short I care about my appearance.  For reference I guess you could say I look like a young George Clooney without as much grey, and I part my hair using longer hair than he does (haha).

Ok so, here goes.  I've never been a real sociable guy; growing up I never hung out with anyone because I was a very sheltered child, my best friends were people like JK Rowling, Brian Jacques, KA Applegate, etc (edit, for the unaware, these are authors of popular adolescents' books).  Then in high school I was the typical nerd, my interests were computers and video games, and I had my friends made of fellow nerds who I had known my entire life.  All was fine since I didn't have a social life anyways.  

But here in college, I've come to realize that I flat out suck socially.  I'm just -not- social.  My best friends are the guys I came to college with from high school who I've known for 10+ years, and I have no problem at all conversing with them.  But with the people that I have met at college, I always have a really hard time making conversation with them even if they're asking me questions pertaining to stuff I like and can normally converse hours on end about.  Plus most of the people that I know here apart from my hs buddies are their friends that they've made here themselves, not people that I've actually met on my own.  Now I'm fine with my buddies on a person-person level, and in small groups I've been working on my skills so that I'm not that much the quiet guy in the corner.

But whenever it comes to being in a larger group, such as being in a bar (or at least I really notice this about myself in bars), I've come to realize that I just shut down in those situations.  For instance last night we went bar hopping and I was cool in the beginning of the night (I didn't drink at all, I was the DD), and my friends had brought some of their female friends who kept trying to get me to dance as the night progressed, but I just wasn't having any of it - I guess because I wasn't comfortable being put on the spot like that or something, I dunno, I actually kind of did want to dance because they were attractive.  They'd come up to me and start dancing to try and pull me out on the floor but I remained stiff as a board leaning against the bar, so as the night went on I would flat out make my way to the wall to stand there at every bar we visited while my buddies were out on the floor having a good time.  

I dunno how to describe it, what I mean by ""shut down"" is that when I'm in large groups it's like as if my personality just flips the switch to off and I become as useful as a cardboard cutout.  I get really shy and whenever someone tries to make conversation I always reply with the least possible, not because I don't not want to talk, I just think of only a small bit to say.  Then I get a look on my face as if I'm pissed even if I'm enjoying myself, but it's like my personality has shut off so my face just drains of emotion.  And I get really introspective, turning to talking to myself in my head (it's not as weird as it sounds, haha) over talking to the people around me.

Now this occurs in any form of group, be it at a bar, in a classroom, at the dining hall, etc.  The more people in a place the more I retreat into my own little shell.  And this really bugs the hell out of me too because as you get older, you're not supposed to **regress** socially.






**TL;DR:** in social environments regardless of what kind, if there's a fair amount of people I shut down and become that guy who stands forever alone in the corner, and I become as unresponsive as an unplugged lamp.  Then I guess I put this into the relationship subreddit-thing because obviously if you don't ever talk to anyone, you can't ever develop a relationship...  halp?",,False,,t5_2s90u,True,,,True,t3_hb9aq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/hb9aq/anyone_else_shut_down_socially/,

I'm 21/m and about to graduate with a BS in comp sci in less than two months.  I'm in pretty good shape - a mostly solid 6'2 190 pounds - from years of playing basketball and football with friends and swimming in HS.  

More and more I'm figuring out who I am as a person and I am for the first time in life starting to become happy with the person I am - both inside and out.  I've been playing guitar for 10+ years and singing my whole life.  Music is one of the most important things in my life and it definitely helped me work through a ton of the self-confidence issues I had as a kid.  I used to sing all the time as a kid, and I remember crying the first time I ever heard my voice recorded on a tape, upset because I ""KNEW"" I would never be able to be a good singer.  Fast forward to college, where I grew and forced myself to listen to my own voice agonizing time after agonizing time until I got over myself and actually started getting good at singing.

I fronted a metal band for two years during college, playing live shows.  This built up a ton of confidence and the knowledge that I was truly talented and gifted at something.  I currently do recording/mixing/production as a hobby and passion, and I'm pretty damn good at it if I do say so myself.

My friends say I'm a very easy to talk to person.  I would agree with this.  I like listening to people and getting to know them.  When I was younger I hated talking to strangers.  I was always shy, and to this day I still struggle with it from time to time. But as I've gotten older I learned how to talk to people - to ask them about themselves, to find common ground, to show interest when you are talking to them, etc.  I'm a little closed off when I first meet someone, but if I am comfortable around you, I can be the life of the effing party.

I guess all of that was just a really long way of saying that I'm at a point in my life where I'm starting to like who I am and slowly building up confidence as a person.  That being said, I still struggle when it comes to girls, and my brain just goes numb when I'm trying to figure out what to do/say in a given situation.

I was overweight/chubby as a kid and was kind of an ugly duckling.  I had friends that I hung out with and got along with, but I was teased a lot as well and it affected the way I would perceive my own appearance, even after I had grown up and lost weight.  To this day I still think I'm fat/overweight.  I have a hard time accepting compliments from people on my physical appearance because I feel like they are lying to me to make me feel better.

My parents do not have what you would call a loving relationship.  When I was a kid, my family life pretty much consisted of fights almost every night about money.  By fights about money, it was pretty much my mom verbally abusing my dad in every way for not making money, despite the fact that he was trying (I know this for a fact).  My dad was a self employed CPA so there were some years where there was less work than others.  It would have been a lot more traumatic for me were it not for my amazing older sister who was always there to occupy me or talk to me when they were having a fight.

I've never really witnessed any affection between my parents, and as an adult I get weirded out when I see my friends in couples just hanging out and showing normal ""relationshipy"" signs of affection towards each other.  It just seems weird/off to me and I don't know how to interpret it.

I do have some relationship experience.  I had a GF for 3 months the summer between freshman and sophomore year.  It was your typical insecure clingy co-dependent relationship (more-so on my end than hers) and she eventually ended it.  I was WAY hung up on this girl for like 2 years afterwards, barely dated/talked to any other girls.  Eventually I learned what I did wrong and grew a LOT as a person from it.  I'm no longer a co-dependent mess (I'd like to believe).  I'm confident in who I am, have learned to make myself happy with my own life, and generally have higher standards for the behavior of both myself and the other person in relationship situations.

But that being said I just feel paralyzed.  It's so rare that I talk to a girl as more than a friend.  I'm scared of when to make the move, how to make it, of worrying that it comes off too strong.  I'm scared of how to act once I'm IN the relationship.  I'm scared of putting my arm around someone when they don't want it there, or initiating a flirty touch etc. because I never saw how that was supposed to look at any point in my life.

*SIDE NOTE* I'm not a virgin, I've been with a few girls, and done cuddling/intimate stuff but more often than not it was initiated by them, and when it was initiated by me it was with a painful anxiety that I was almost positive they could hear in their own brain.

I'm your classic over-thinker.  Also, I tend to be more emotional than the average person (just comes with the territory of being a musician).  I get too caught up in the small victories and defeats that are (what I'm slowly learning) the norm in the dating game.  I'm not describing the way I dump on other people, just moreso of what happens internally in my head.

This last girl I was talking to, I'm pretty sure I ruined things with all of my internal anguish.  I never dumped an ounce of it onto her, but I'm sure it shaped the overly-rigid way in which I would ask her out and just sort of act about relationshipy things when I was with her.  Too bad.  We got along really really well and had a ton in common.  Now things are kind of weird between us.  Granted, she herself is a shy person with an introvertive nature, but dammit, if I had just been more confident I could have made her feel more comfortable around me and maybe things would've worked.

I want a girlfriend reddit.  Well, correction.  I don't put that kind of pressure on myself.  I don't need a girlfriend to be happy.  But a guy's gotta have the skills to cultivate a relationship when the opportunity arises.

What's wrong with me reddit?  I can play guitar and sing in front of large crowds.  I've nailed pretty much every interview I've ever had.  I can make you talk about yourself, make you laugh, and put you at ease.  I can dominate on a basketball court, football field, or swimming pool.  Yet there is this one little hole in my confidence that, when made obvious to me, makes me feel like the powerless little overweight/ugly kid who is scared by the sound of his own voice.

Some time between November and December I will meet a new girl, get to talking to her more often by January. After a while of just hanging out and seeing each other it starts getting serious. A few months go by, normal relationship stuff, even though I never seriously ask them to be my girlfriend, I just kind of go with it.

I end up getting very into them, and contemplating actually asking them out. Well then it gets weird, I start finding ways to push them away, I seem to do anything I can to make them not like me, starting meaningless fights, becoming jealous, etc. Now it's around march or April and one fight ends up turning into, I don't want to be with you swear_no. I want to just be friends. The always repeated lines of, ""I just want to be your friend. I don't want to be anything more right now, but maybe later.""

Now from there it becomes me breaking down, becoming depressed, paranoid, and just overall horrible feelings. I also try to win them back, but they throw out one word answers, and don't want to see me, etc. My next few months then become me intensely depressing and solitary. End of summer I'm single and not really giving a shit, but not necessarily happy. Then Nov/Dec comes around, and it starts over with a new girl.

Why am I not able to keep a relationship or hold onto a girl? I know my pushing them away constantly leads to it, but what the hell is my problem with that? I don't see why I always do it.

This is my first real relationship, and it was with someone I was really close to for a while. He's had about 4, and his first more serious one had ended right before we started (that one it seems has been going through a fallout ever since I even acquainted with him, which was really sad. I was trying to help not let that happen, but circumstances were terrible -- no one externally from those two could fix it).


We have been super comfortable (well awkward at first because I was a bit awkward about it, since it was my first serious one a year after a little 'phase' with someone I really didn't want to be with) from the get go.


Problem is, there is no problem, but I keep getting worried. That's my tendency in general, but I get a bit scared that he's more attracted to all those other girls on his social networking site, who are conventionally prettier, cuter etc., even though the reason he even was serious with me was because we were so close before that in a more, best friend level. I mean, utmost, since I rarely have that many friends, and only one or two close friends, and for him, I think it was shocking since it was emotionally, very deep. So the choice we made of going further, worked out really well. We're even more comfortable and are exploring more depth in this extended stage of our relationship.


Ever so often though, I get jealous. Suspicious of other girls trying to lure him in emotionally or carnally. There was actually one incident that drove me crazy, and was actually very accurate that it was happening (he was totally unaware, until he was like awgh after I pointed out many things, and we were both basically just in awe at why she wasn't backing off, despite the few hints that I gave of feeling uncomfortable with the way she was basically flirting with him.)


But in all other circumstances, I think I might just be overly aware, and jealous, and all these other bad things. I feel terrible because he would never ever go after someone else. And he expressed that he has never considered being with these girls on the social networking site. I really don't know what to do. After that incident with that girl, I get just, despondent, and basically tell myself to back off from the situation so that I could be clearheaded and not burden him with my concerns. But I have to tell him everything I feel because he could read it from my face. So, prevention is so hard for me. I don't know what to do. We have everything going so extremely well, so why would I have these concerns?


This post may be very obvious to him if he looks at this, but it's just, I want to make sure that there is another option I could take to become better besides trying not to have these thoughts. Does anyone have any advice for me? We both are super happy, but I want to get rid of this part of me. I have never done this before. I suspect that it may be because of the very heartbreaking betrayal I underwent from a family member that sort of messed me up...

Especially ThePecanSandie. So I am now 100% single and not pursuing a relationship with, well, anyone.**

I'm 29/F, my boyfriend is 25/M. We've been together a year and a couple of days.

When we initially met, we hit it off amazingly. The infatuation phase only lasted about a week, but we would see each other 3-4 times a month (mostly weekends) and things were great. Then when that semester of school ended, he moved back home and we were around each other almost 24/7. He then got kicked out of his apartment for smoking pot and I let him crash at my apartment.. and well, he never left, and threw a bitchfit anytime I asked him to.

So we lived together for a little over six months or so, he stopped going to college so he could hang out on the internet all day and work part-time in a warehouse environment. Over this time, I resented him for not having to work and for putting the burden of all the bills (except groceries) on me, and our conflicting work schedules certainly didn't help matters.

Fast forward to a few months ago, I met someone whom I clicked with instantly (27/M). We've been friends for about three months, and have both had romantic feelings for one another for at least two of those months. The infatuation period won't go away (with me, it usually does fairly quickly, I fall for people then move on in the span of a week or two). He has career goals that supercede my own, are conducive to me being able to be a stay-at-home mom for the first 5 years of my child's life and then enter the workforce once my child is in school. He's also a musician, writing music with no lyrics.. and I'm a singer, writing lyrics but no music. In the short time we've known each other, we've both shared very deep, very personal things with each other that we have never shared with ANYBODY else in the world. We're just that comfortable with each other. I can't really explain why, but I just know we're going to be friends forever. It's a feeling I have in my gut. At one point I left my b/f to be with this guy, but that didn't pan out due to kids and ex-wife drama (basically the bitch ultimatumed him. I'd honestly kill her if it wouldn't hurt the kids.. thankfully I'm willing to put the kids' best interests ahead of my own and not do something that stupid. prolly keep me out of jail, too). He's sticking around and doing counseling, gave his wife 3 months for them to either make progress forward or go their separate ways -- the relationship lives or dies completely unrelated to me.

The problem is, my b/f wants me to cut off all contact.

The problem is... I can't.

I see where he's coming from, and I understand why he wants me to cut off contact with this other guy, but I refuse to. I've tried multiple times, and I fail every time. I'll buckle down and give it my all, but I can't let go of him for more than 24 hours. 

Admittedly, I have mental health problems. I am bipolar and currently on medication for the issue. I am also in therapy again after almost a year of not going to therapy regularly.

My b/f has been more than understanding. He's willing to help me out every step of the way, put up with the neverending drama, put up with the bullshit, pick me up everytime I end up crying over this other guy.. and yes I appreciate that, and I know intellectually that I would be CRAZY to give him up just so I can be foreveralone..

.. but I love him dearly, and I think I'm hurting him more by holding onto him and dragging him through my crap than I would be by just letting him go.

So what should I do?? Should I let him keep giving away parts of himself indefinitely until he's nothing more than a shell of the man he used to be.. or should I let him be free to go find someone that can make him happy and stop letting him put his dick in crazy?

I recently broke up with my boyfriend of three months and have gotten over that well enough. But the reason we broke up was mainly my fault; as soon as I get close to someone I push them away and become disgusted when they touch me. I have issues with intimacy, however, I can be very affectionate in the beginning of the relationship. It just deteriorates at some point. I realize that this may be because of the abuse I experienced as a child. But the main problem here is that I have feelings for someone right now and I think that this will lead to an eventual relationship. I just don't know how I'm supposed to function in a normal, long term relationship. How do I get past my feelings of fear when it comes to affection? Or rather, how do I prevent this from happening in the first place? I'm sorry if this is a weird question.


tldr; Fear of affection lead to a recent breakup, but I have feelings for a great guy now. How do I stop myself from messing up another relationship?

Back then, I thought that I was used to not caring about losing, but I'm starting to notice that not being the case this past month. I felt very uncomfortable and not good enough.

We'd play a few games and I said that I didn't improve at all, even though I scored slightly higher the second game. I got called out on my statement, which really made me put things in perspective.

I wasn't the most athletic during high school/college, but my friends are since they play a lot more outside than me (so I feel like it's tough for me to catch up). I feel like I can improve, but I haven't been confident at all being last place all the time. They say relax, but it's easier said than done.

 I moved to a different area and she moved to the same place. We worked together and she would always strike up a conversation with me. She invited me bowling, etc.

Some Background: We met in a club for our mutual interest, dancing. We both invested a lot of time into it, so we spent a lot of time together, and became really tight friends. She is a wonderful person and a great friend, but I can't see myself dating her. We have some ideological differences which are perfectly ignorable as friends, but I expect would be irreconcilable in a different context, and I really want to remain friends, both because she is great, and because if something happened I would probably have to leave our club, which I would very much something I would like to avoid. Now, she has not flat out said she wants a relationship, but if I were a gambling man, I'd give it 10:1 odds she's into me.

I am not hugely fond of contact), and refers to me as ""her favorite"" and the like.

I thought things would be easy to manage, not turn into this convoluted mess.

Where to begin...

I have been in a relationship with my Fiance' for about...two and a half years now. Things were rocky to start, as I was tossed into his lap, (due to my Mother and Step Father kicking me out, because I would not dump him like they expressly told me to.) I did not imagine that he wanted me. But we remained with one another, he permitted me to continue to stay with him, took care of my every need ( even medical ), going out of his way to ensure my anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts were tended to. He did his best to make me feel loved and cared for. 

Now I won't lie, we have our issues. He is a rather stubborn male, I am a stubborn female. ( We're both active in the BDSM lifestyle. As we live it 24/7.) We also live a poly lifestyle. We date people together or sometimes seperately. It's...normal to say the least. 

But in the last few months...we seem to have pulled away from one another...started arguing more and more. LEss sex, less BDSM activies...

I have regressed back to where I was in the beginning...my anxiety at an all time high...

( Mind you I am 21 now and he is 32. ) 

He has begun talking to an 18 year old. ( The age I was when I had been dropped into his lap. ) She is rather beautiful, far smarter than I am....more open to her sexuality and they have long conversations, well into the night. 

I have begun to feel...that he is loosing interest in me. I do my best to make things easier, try not to feel jealous...

I even offered to make dinner tonight. He logged into his facebook, put on his headphones and said he had pizza to eat. We arrived home at 5:00pm. He's been on the internet talking with her for over an hour...

I don't know how to approach him about how I feel, the last time we spoke on it....he told me ""Jealousy is ugly on you."" Whenever I hear her name....I feel my chest tighten, nausea hit me and I just wish to scream.

What should I do? Is there any point to continuing my anxiety and jealousy or....should I just push this all aside and attempt to make this work?

I'm a 30 year old male who, following a decades worth of jobs working in offices etc, has been unemployed for most of the last year. 

Within the same time frame, I've made a conscious and verbalised decision to aim for a proper career and follow my dreams. This includes applying for university and concentrating on better myself at my drawing/writing, as well as obviously getting any job ASAP and moving out of the government housing I'm in. 

Unfortunately, I've slipped into my old routine of sitting around, surfing the web for pointless bits of information, playing video games constantly, and interspersing this with getting drunk or hanging out at friends. I was supposed to apply for university a month ago, I've made little to no effort to get a job, and am accruing debt from living on government money.

I'm fairly certain that one day of solid job applications would start me back on the road to normality, but I'm terrified. I spend the vast majority of every day sitting in the same spot, focusing on this computer screen. I still socialise fairly often, and am glad to see friends and meet new people, but when I'm alone, I go into a kind of 'stasis' where I'm essentially waiting for my next chance to get out and about, and procrastinating every else in-between. I have unpaid bills, my friends are clearly starting to become aware of how long I've been unemployed (currently five months) and I'm basically staying perfectly still in the hopes that if I don't make any sudden moves, everything will be ok, even though I know it won't be.

I'm open to the possibility that I have depression/anxiety and will be talking to my doctor on Thursday with regards to getting back on a prescription after some years. This much is probably obvious, but I'm unsure about which facet of my mind is causing so much apprehension. I'm not sure if it's change or failure that I'm afraid of.

Additionally, I have several circles of friends, and although I'm well liked, one of them contains a few people who are really affecting my mental state by criticising me constantly and dishing out pretty obvious life advice titbits (sort your life out, you can do anything etc) delivered in a pretty aggressive way. Am I right in thinking I should minimise contact with this lot for a while?

Alright I've written a mighty wall here, I'll leave it for now. Thank you if you've read this far.

I'm 25 years old and a Marine veteran. I never saw actual combat, even though I went to Iraq twice as a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) pilot. I never gained any major citations, but I did some good charity work before I finished my pilot training, and got a few letters of commendation for that. I joined up pretty early in my life, basically straight out of high school, where I had friends but felt more like a loner for most of my life. I couldn't tell you why. I was always picked on and called names that I didn't understand because my family is Catholic and since this was before the coming of the all-mighty Internet, I couldn't very well look up any of the names they were calling me. I had a temper too; in 3rd grade I stabbed another child with a pencil, and got in trouble for numerous fights while in school. Not many things comforted me, especially after my family moved to a neighborhood mainly comprised of retirees. Reading did, as well as playing video games. I started playing the trumpet in 6th grade and it helped too, but there were only so many times and places I could practice. I became proficient and switched my focus to baritone/euphonium. In high school, I joined marching band and was promoted to Low Brass Captain. I graduated with a 3.0 GPA and moved on. 

Eight years after that and here I am. I spent five years in the Marines, was promoted to Sergeant, and then got myself into a silly situation which saw me demoted to Corporal. I accepted it; it was my fault that it happened and so I took the punishment. I tried to re-enlist, but my weight and office politics took hold, and so I received an Honorable Discharge and moved back in with my family, where I got a job at GameStop and started going to college.

I've finally made it to the point where my manager wants to promote me and I'm attending a major university for Computer Science, but I still feel like something's missing in my life.

I feel alone, since my love life is all but dead. That's not to say that I haven't had relationships, but they all have crashed and burned rather spectacularly. My first real relationship was with another Marine (we're very egalitarian in the Corps). After a week, she decided to stop seeing me. My second was on the same base, with a very clingy sailor who wanted to merge our bank accounts after the first two or three days. Being 18 at the time, I immediately got hives and left her after a few more days. After that, it never felt like I should start another relationship; I never knew what was going to happen next and it wouldn't be fair to whomever I was dating if I had to go to Iraq or move to a new base. 

After my discharge, I spent a year just going to school and I did quite well: I made the Dean's List twice while I was attending the local community college, before I transferred to the afore-mentioned major univeristy. The beginning of my second year, though, I met someone, let's call her Gina. Gina and I met completely randomly; we were assigned to be lab partners when she finally showed up to lab after spending a week sorting out her financial aid. We ""hit it off"" and started spending time together, ostensibly to study (which we did a lot of) as well as becoming somewhat romantically involved to a point. She didn't want to become too attached because of her ex-boyfriend at the time. And then I ended up moving an hour away to the university, where it became much more difficult for us to spend time together. Then she had one of her closest friends pass away, and moved in with her friend's family to help take care of everything. Fast-forward a few months, while I'm at work, and she lets me know that her friend's 42 year old widower has proposed and Gina accepted.

I almost turned my store into a war zone.

She says she loves him. And I have/am accepting this; there's no way around it.

But I really don't think I can find anyone else like her again. She woke up a part of me that I really didn't think existed; she taught me what it was like to feel actual love and not the platitudes that I say to my immediate family. Will I always love her? In my own way, yes. Do I want to move on? Absolutely. I don't want to sit here and waste myself on someone that I can't be with.

And so I joined OKCupid and Plenty of Fish, and neither one has brought me any joy so far. All the women seem to just not be interested in me. And while I hear everyone saying ""It takes time, be patient,"" I'm tired of being alone. I just want someone who can accept and love me for me while encouraging me to grow and change along the paths that I choose, and who I can love and grow with.

The problem seems to be that I don't have enough self-confidence. Whenever I talk to conventionally pretty women, I get tongue-tied and left behind instead of just going with the flow. I'm not witty. I'm not handsome (at least, in my own opinion). I hate clubs; I can never think straight with the bass. I don't dance very well, when I do dance. I weigh over 280 lbs.

So what do I do, Reddit?

We’re entering phase two of our new flair system and we’re so excited to tell you about the new changes we’re making. 

By popular demand, we’re moving away from having individual subreddits for various relationship-related issues, and we’re merging all our subreddits together. We are going to incorporate the satellite subs into /r/relationships with our new, amazing tag system. We’re hoping this will alleviate some of the tension over people being asked to move their posts into smaller subreddits. 

Instead of posting to /r/iHaveissues, you will be staying in /r/relationships with your post tagged for 'Personal Issues'. Users can use the filtering function, [seen here]( http://i.imgur.com/1VJWaSJ.png), to decide what posts they want to read. 
__________________________________________
**Subreddits that we’re rolling into /r/relationships**

* /r/Breakups
* /r/Dating_advice

**Subreddits remaining separate**

* /r/Settlethis

/r/Settlethis is remaining separate because it is our brand new project and we want it to have some space to breathe and grow on its own. This subreddit is a place for couples to come, make their own posts regarding a relationship issue or disagreement, and link to one another’s content. Then users can weigh in to help that couple sort out their disagreement and arbitrate the discussion. Because that’s such an odd format for reddit, we wanted to give this new project its own space. 
____________________________________________________________________
Please be patient with us. 

This is new for us too and we’re working hard to iron out the kinks in the system. That being said, we don’t pretend like this will be flawless. Give us some leeway while we make these changes.

In 2009, I met up with a guy I went to high school with but never hung out with because he really just seemed weird.  He (23M) was a perfect gentleman, we had fun together, and were at ease with each other.  
     He lived about 3 hours from me and after talking for a bit told me that he didn't want to do a long distance relationship.  So, I moved in with him, no questions asked. I guess this was my first mistake.  Shortly after moving in(2 months), we found out that I was pregnant.  We were both upset, but knew we did it to ourselves and had to step up to the plate.  I met his parents and basically told them I was pregnant.  That was crazy, but they had nothing but open arms for me. 
   After a few months of being pregnant and my bf working all the time to save up, his mom suggested that I move in with them so that I would have someone around in case something went wrong....we were living in Baton Rouge (2 or so hours from our families).  In August, I did and about a month or so afterwards, he did too.  
   Everything was great.  We got along, he found another job, we were lucky enough that his parents were allowing us to live there to save up and that we didn't have to pay a penny.  They are amazing.  Our daughter was born in January 2010.  She was amazing.  We were a perfect family.  Everything seemed to be falling into place.  Then, my bf went to this ''ACTORS EXPO"" and decided he wanted to go to school in NYC.  This is where things started to change.  I feel as if I didn't have a choice in this and it didn't matter what I said.  He wanted to become an actor and just couldn't do that in LA.  I thought he would go to school in NYC and then come back home.  I had a 9 month old, was about to start college myself, and now my bf was moving 1400 miles away to follow his dream.  I completely supported him by the way.  I never tell someone that their dreams are outrageous or not acceptable.
   In September 2010 my bf left me and our child with his parents in LA to go to NYC.  HE LEFT!!! AND MADE IT SEEM EASY!  I know it couldn't have been, but mind you he was the one not willing to have a ""long distance relationship"" 3 hours apart in the beginning but is now going 1400 miles away.  We phoned and webcam-ed often but it wasn't the same.  
   He missed so many firsts for our child.  Her first steps, 1st and 2nd birthdays, Christmas', and the other holidays as well.  The kicker to this is that Allyson thought her daddy was a computer screen, but it's what he wanted so I let him go for it.  The consequences of this were manageable, but not ideal.  I had to raise her alone (with his parents) and we got to see each other probably twice a year.  It was hard, but I fell in love with him and not a phone.  
    In June 2012(almost 2 years later), I packed up my life and child, left my family and friends behind as well as the only home I had ever known, and moved to New Jersey to be a family.  This is really the only thing that I wanted.  To have her father raise her and be happy as a family.  
   In September, my grandfather was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer.  I flew home immediately and stayed for 2 months.  I wanted to stay with my PawPaw as much as possible.  He raised me after I lost my father in 1995 (I was 5). My PawPaw meant the world to me and I HAD to be there with him and make memories I'd be proud of.  
  
   I started feeling alone.  I missed LA so much.  I was having fun.  I wanted to be with my family and friends again.  I had a lot going on in my head and LA is where I wanted to be.  In December I got a call saying my PawPaw only had 2-3 weeks left.  I was on the plane out 2 days later.  We lost my grandfather on January 3, 2013.  This is still hard to deal with now.  I was losing my dad all over again.  So with this, I started to realize even more than before that it was because I chose to be with my bf that I had missed important time with my grandfather.  That since we started dating, I had lost the girl/woman I wanted to be.  I am a country loving, hard-headed, outdoorsy type person.  I love camping and fishing and mud riding and he is the polar opposite.  Give him a game console and a computer and he is fine.  We wouldn't go out to bars because he said he didn't like it.  We would stay inside and I was fading away. I told him how I was feeling but didn't want to make any decisions over the phone. 
   Anyways, I came back to New Jersey.  He crowded me, hovered over my shoulder as I texted my friends, and kept pushing me to talk about my PawPaw.  I insisted I wasn't ready, but one night he pushed me too far and I laid things out for him.  How I hated it in the city, being away from my family and friends, being alone and feeling alone although he was right there.  Things got heated and I told him I was leaving.  For about 2 weeks I organized my thoughts and paper work and tried to come up the the $3000 to move back home.  We were civil and I insisted that he could keep in touch with our daughter.  I just wasnt happy here.  
    After things had cooled down, I asked if he would give us a chance and move back home.  He said he would think about it.  This was his choice....1. Go back home (where he hated the small community), look for acting work close by and get an agent there, and KEEP his family  or 2. Stay here to chase his dream and LOSE his family.   I said I'd never make him choose, but I'm tired of not going anywhere.  He didn't want to talk about it and when we did he said I was being a bitch and forcing him to choose.  In my eyes, it was black and white..plain and simple.  My family would win in an instant.  There wouldn't even be a choice.  
  A 4 year relationship, 3 year old daughter, 2 years of being together via phone, and a year (almost) of me giving up EVERYTHING at a chance to make us work and I have NO proposal, feel more alone now than ever, and I am still raising our daughter for the most part.  I know nothing of this place, have 1 friend out here, no family, no car, no job (although I went to school to be a massage therapist in LA) and I feel miserable.  I hate it here and have no reason other than him to be here. 
   As I was packing, I couldn't stop crying.  I really love him and want to make it work, but am I crazy to give up so much in order for him to have EVERYTHING HE WANTS?  Am I selfish for wanting a bit more from him? Or would it be simpler to go our separate ways so that we both get a little bit of what we want but still hurt each other for being selfish and choosing our own lives over the others?
   I am so confused and just wanted to see if there is something I am not seeing because I am so narrow minded.",,False,,t5_2s90u,False,,,True,t3_19coql,http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/19coql/i_23f_have_been_dating_a_23m_for_almost_4_years/,
