**EDIT:** /u/NoAirBanding has [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1fj6yf/psa_if_you_downloaded_gifcam_a_program_that_was/caasgmr) that the two downloads (gifcam.net and bahraniapps.com) might be different (confirmed by me). I thought I had tested both but it turns out I must have tested the one from gifcam.net three times instead of the third time being the bahraniapps.com one. **If you downloaded the file from bahraniapps.com (the link in the creator's post), you should be okay.**

Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) reports the self-extractor as Backdoor:Win32/Fynloski.A (apparently also known as DarkComet RAT or some variant thereof) during a manual scan, but does not catch it when it is run (or I missed the notification). (As /u/sprremix pointed out, why does it need a self-extractor for a single executable?)

The program makes a file in %APPDATA% called `bahranisoft.exe` (the creator's website's name) or `extrctr.exe` and forces it to run on Windows startup (the program creates some registry keys to do so).

Keylogger logs can be found in `%APPDATA%\dclogs` and are named `&lt;date&gt;-#.dc` (""dc"" meaning ""DarkComet"" I presume). These are plain text files you may view in a text editor such as Notepad. Inside each .dc file you will find logs of every application you have opened (including the time) and typed or pressed keys in (Skype, your web browser, video games), clipboard changes, and more. If you've typed any passwords, credit card information, etc., you'll probably find them here with a bit of CTRL+F'ing.

----

I **strongly** suggest you scan your computer with [MalwareBytes' Antimalware](http://www.malwarebytes.org) (MBAM) and/or Microsoft Security Essentials if you've downloaded and run GifCam (edit: from gifcam.net).

If you have files in `%APPDATA%\dclogs` (MBAM will detect these as ""`Stolen.Data`""), you'll probably want to browse through those before deleting them to see what personal information has been collected (and potentially sent somewhere), and change passwords for those sites (once you've cleaned your computer) and call any credit card companies/banks/etc. that should be made aware of potential problems in relation to a keylogger gathering your information.",,False,,t5_2qh19,1370205181.0,,,True,t3_1fj6yf,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1fj6yf/psa_if_you_downloaded_gifcam_a_program_that_was/,

I know I said that I'd always be true to you. I said our relationship was forever. We are both different now. I don't feel the need to be a part of the cult of Firefox anymore, and to be fair......you've put on some weight. I remember back when I first met you.....you were thin, sleek, and ran quickly. You didn't have all those ugly ActiveX things going on, and you were pretty much exactly what you said you were. Over the years, you've put on some bloat. Your memory footprint crept up so slowly I hardly noticed. Now you are the largest user of memory on my pc. That makes it difficult to do things outside of the browser. I still love you FireFox...I think I always will in some way. Before you ask....yes....there is someone else. I think it started innocently enough. Chrome came on the scene with little fanfare. It was just a toy at first. Something to check out every now and again. It was something I used mainly just to play around on from time to time. Then I noticed some things that made me fall in love. Chrome is faster than you, thinner than you, and dare I say better looking than you. It runs each tab in it's own process and manages to stay thinner than you. It closes tabs when I tell it to close them, and doesn't lock up the whole browser when one tab is being a prick. Perhaps we should just say goodbye....no....not goodbye, but ""See you later."" I hoped it wouldn't come to this, but until you change your ways, you can't be a part of my life anymore.

I've been working on this project, Paranoid Messaging, for about a week now, and I wanted to share the progress I've made so far with Reddit! The link is at the bottom of this post, but I'll fill the space with an overview of some of the features;
*SSL-independent security; all sensitive messages to and from the server have an extra level of strong encryption (4096-bit RSA to the server, 256-bit AES from the server). This way, even an attacker who has subverted the CA cannot read your messages.
*Secure data storage; all messages on the server are secured with 2048-bit OpenPGP, and the passwords are never stored in an unencrypted format. This way, even the server op can't read your messages without seriously changeing the site code. 
*SSL-less MITM foiling; after you create an account, the server identifies itself with it's RSA public key. But to prevent a MITM impersonating the server, that key is encrypted with AES using a hash of your password as the key. (This area is still in development)

I am looking for any contributers/designers to help me improve this project.

1368193485.0,68,self.software,1e2gav,Warning - Do NOT install or buy any Wondershare products.,RealNotFake,97,29,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1e2gav/warning_do_not_install_or_buy_any_wondershare/,"Wondershare is a piece of garbage. I installed their streaming audio recorder program and used the trial. It actually worked fairly well and I was considering purchasing it. Then I uninstalled it because the trial was over. I then needed it again later that day so I tried installing it again and of course it wouldn't let me. They  use sophisticated registry tweaks to prevent you from re-using the trial after it's over. What I realized is that they spew their garbage all over the registry. If you use a program like process monitor, you can see TONS of registry accesses when the program boots up, more than I've seen in any other 3rd party program on Windows. I have no problem with a company using the registry to prevent re-using a trial (though most good programs don't do this), but I do have a problem with Wondershare completely gunking up my registry. I started to have a sour taste in my mouth.

So then I uninstalled again and I thought that was that. A few days later, I start to see these SUPER ANNOYING pop up ads on my desktop. Luckily they were advertising Wondershare products, otherwise I probably wouldn't know what the source was. It was a pop up that basically said ""Get a deal X% off of Wondershare"" plus a link to the site. It was a familiar ad, because when I previously uninstalled Wondershare, it had immediately launched my browser and took me to a ""special deal"" page that claimed I would get a % discount if I ordered right now. Obviously it's an underhanded tactic to grab peoples' money before they forget about the product. I wonder if anyone has actually fallen for that crap...

I verified that I uninstalled all Wondershare products, but the popup ads were still occurring, about once a day in the morning. That's when I found a malware program called ""Wondershare Helper"" running in my processes and that it somehow added itself to my startup processes without my permission. THIS IS MALWARE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. I did a google search and found that other people have been similarly pissed off about this, and their response was to basically go and delete the Helper program. The helper program was installed into C:\Program Files\Common Files\Wondershare, which is different than the main application folder that was previously under Program Files. When I tried to delete the application it gave me an access denied error, because the process was still running in memory. I had to force quit the process before I could delete the helper, and this was after Wondershare had already supposedly been removed from my system (and did not appear anywhere in Add/Remove Program). 

In conclusion, this company is worthless, and you should not do business with them or even install their free trials. It will completely gunk up your system with malware. They are a very shady company and they made a very conscious business decision to install junk on your computer.",,False,,t5_2qh19,False,,,True,t3_1e2gav,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1e2gav/warning_do_not_install_or_buy_any_wondershare/,

No panic, just go to the website and get them back. 

So i go to events and see the event ""  You deleted 39629 files "" but there is no Undelete. No way to undo an event. You can just see it. Utterly pointless.

After a few days of manually undeleting the files I sent a message to Dropbox following their procedure for asking for an undelete. Days later I get a reply that they are too busy to help.

Surely a bulk undelete feature would not be hard to implement and one that would be high on the trust needs of users.

So just a warning to others....

I was just wondering if anyone here knows why it's been delayed so many times. In my opinion, Firefox is seriously starting to ""feel"" old. The default 3.6 UI is ugly, the improvements that 3.7 was supposed to bring were delayed/pushed to 4.0. Speed-wise, it's not up to par either. The plugins are still awesome, and I know these problems are fixed in 4.0, but it feels like they are having a reaally hard time keeping up with their [schedule](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4/Beta) (which has already been updated because they were seriously far behind).

I'm particularly concerned about [this](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2010-12-07#Firefox):

    *  [AT RISK] Finish Firefox 4
          o 224 Firefox/Toolkit blockers 

And the fact that they couldn't keep up with their ""zero reproducible high/crit &gt; 30 days"" bug policy.

I know there are betas, but I was wondering if anyone actually knew the reasons behind this. Is the code base difficult to maintain? Shortage of people? Or am I alone in my perceptions?

I am positively surprised by the number of comments. :) If one asks for my personal opinion, I prefer foobar - I have always thought of it is an excellent music player. However, I think that since winamp has the larger user base, we would develop for winamp first.

1st time posting here, but wanted to give [Executor](http://executor.dk/) some love. It's been around a very long time but all my co-workers always comment on it and have never seen it before, so thought I'd share the knowledge as it's pretty hidden away.

In short, Executor is a background run dialogue, that I like to think allows you to perform the actions you want to achieve, rather than being forced into then thinking about how you will achieve them.

For example, when I want to write a new email (which I do a lot of at work), I press the (configurable) keyboard shortcut I have set (ALT+Z) and the Executor box appears ([pic](http://imgur.com/EOeY4FH)) and I just type ""mail"", which opens Outlook (if it's closed) and opens a new email immediately for me. 

Another example to illustrate the goal-oriented nature of it would be if I want to do a google search. Ordinarily, this can be a few clicks - e.g. click ""Start"", programs, Chrome, click the address bar, type, enter. With Executor, I simply ALT+Z and type ""g wimbledon"" and hit enter. It fires up the program, takes anything after ""g"" as a search string and executes it. Over the course of a day this actually makes everything a lot quicker.

It's highly configurable. ""g"" in the example above is because I configured that. I could make it ""q"" (for query). Or - just as easily - ""w [query]"" to fire up a Wikipedia query. Or ""lastfm [band name]"".

It will auto-search for programs on your machine and also index all files on local and network drives (if you want - I have all this switched off to reduce CPU overhead, although it's tiny anyway. But I prefer manual config).

I have some useful config strings set up if you want to get started and would be happy to share. 

Typing ""excel"" is much easier than looking for the icon or traversing menus. It also does inline maths, so I never open calculator.

A hard one to find, and is now 2nd nature for me, is the Outlook new mail one, which is:
Command:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\OUTLOOK.EXE
Params:
/c ipm.note

Hope this is useful to someone.",,False,,t5_2qh19,False,,,True,t3_1i00cd,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1i00cd/executor_handsdown_the_best_freeware_pc_program/,

&gt;I am very angry that now you require me to have 2 separate internet programs, the hugest one, which is most prone to attack, exclusively for this stupid book that you are only renting me, and ticking off the days now as punishment for not using the default internet program.

&gt;If you are going to punish people for non-compliance to your demands, you should warn people before you rent them the book.

&gt;I don't know what to do now, but I can't catch up on my homework until I figure it out. There are 5 wireless computers in this household, and none of them have ie installed.

&gt;Does your IT dept know if there is a way to access ie without screwing up my computer? All the computers I have access to use Mozilla Firefox. I don't even know anyone who uses ie anymore, we are 10 years into this century now, perhaps you might consider updating your access program.

&gt;Your company is really disturbing my peace, perhaps you would like to require me to change my email to manNotSoMuchAtPeaceAnymore@&lt;place&gt;.com

&gt;How about IfeelCheatedBy&lt;CompanyName&gt;@&lt;place&gt;.com, certainly, I now have wasted a bunch of time that I had earmarked for something else, and now will have to adjust to missing the 3pm deadline.

&gt;Is there a work-around or not?

Unfortunately, the software we pay lots of money to use from a wonderful company named Oracle requires IE installed.

(When you plot to transfer me to another idiot rep, put me on hold, don't let me hear what you're saying) I tell the guy I know he is another ""so called tech"" who still can't help me. I get transferred to again and after 45 minutes... I hang up. I'm sorry, but I'm done with you. I would go with your competitor but, oh wait, you own the fucking market share. All of it. I FUCKING HATE YOU. GO FUCK YOURSELF.

c:\program files\7-zip\7z.exe a -mx5 d:\data\backup\""%DATE:~4,2%-%DATE:~7,2%-%DATE:~-4%"".7z ""c:\users\admin\my documents""

* ""c:\program files\7-zip\7z.exe"" (location where 7-zip was installed)
* ""a"" (add files to an archive)
* ""mx5"" (compression ratio - mx0=no compression/mx1=low compression/mx3=fast compression/mx5=normal compression/mx7=maximum compression/mx9=ultra compression)
* ""d:\data\backup\""%DATE:~4,2%-%DATE:~7,2%-%DATE:~-4%"".7z"" (creates a timestamped .7z archive in my backup folder d:\data\backup in the format MM-DD-YYYY.7z)
* ""c:\users\admin\my documents"" (Folder that will be backed up)

I run the batch file (copy and paste into notepad, save as .bat) using the windows task scheduler at 4 am each night and its been working perfectly, compressing about 250 MB of documents to a 100 MB archive on my backup drive.

but apart from that, wtf? why cant I place bookmark icons next to the address bar and need to make a whole horizontal bar for the few icons I have (especially painful on my small netbook screen)? Why can't I decide myself whether I want to search in a search engine or skim through my history? Not to mention the fact, that I can't effectively swap between search engines - it makes a huge difference whether I want to search IMDB or Wikipedia for example.


I'd love to love Chrome. It's light-weight and fast, but why does it treat its users like completely non-savvy newbies? I understand that simplicity is a priority, but why not let us make some simple changes?

It always amazes me when an otherwise great app limits the users in ways which do not provide any extra value (in terms of performance for instance). The main problem is that goddamn address bar. Using Firefox (or Opera, as I believe it has it designed in a similar way) is still ten times faster despite its loading time, as I can navigate to any website I frequent with a single keystroke (that includes specific threads on reddit and other discussion boards). If I wanted to go to the subreddit ""technology"", I should be able to type ""te"" and get there right away - I don't want to look for ""te"" in a search engine! It's completely counterintuitive. 

I'm an active member of a discussion board dedicated to music. Most of the time I read topics which have existed for some time, pertaining to certain bands, genres etc. In Firefox, it takes me less than a second to find the topic I want to read, from among hundreds of those I have visited. In Chrome I always have to wait until it decides what to display, and even if it luckily decides I wasn't about to use the search engine, the process of finding in history is slow and VERY imprecise. 

Say I want to go to a thread about the band Slayer. In Firefox, I type ""Sl"", press enter and there I am. In Chrome, what I see after typing ""Sl"" is ""Sl - Google search"", then a couple of google results (in this case it displays links to dictionaries...). In order to get to this thread by means of the address bar (to omit going through the entire structure of the board), I'd have to write the name of the discussion board and then see if I'm lucky enough for Chrome to understand what I meant by ""Sl""... Which happens rarely.

/rant

-----------------------------------

**edit:** (I'll copy one of my responses to make things clear):

It's not about convincing anybody. Chrome is a decent browser anyway - it's just that I focused on it's drawbacks that it seems I hate it ;). It's not the case. However, I just wish I could use it on my netbook (because on a regular desktop there is NO difference in performance between FF and C), but with these little annoyances, I can't. Hence, the rant ;)

**edit2:** What I meant when I wrote about the bookmarks: Firefox allows me to do this: http://i.imgur.com/vA2u5.png -&gt; everything in a single row: address bar, buttons, bookmarks, search. the address bar is still long enough and I have access to my most used bookmarks at all times. saves a lot of space and I don't have to switch anything.",,False,,t5_2qh19,True,,,True,t3_fd1wr,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/fd1wr/a_little_criticism_of_chrome_why_despite_all_its/,

I saw a few solutions out there that used AutoHotKey or other scripts to work around it, but I wanted to write something that fit my needs and that I could share with others.
Essentially, I was tired of launching my portable password database every time I sat down at my work or home computer, and wanted a way to have that happen automatically. It also lets me remove the drive using a keyboard shortcut, so that I can have it automatically close my password database and unmount the drive.

This is very much a beta, but I think it is something that I can share with others who might want the same functionality. I'm open to criticism, feedback, patches, adding features, etc. It doesn't have an installer yet, but it just requires .Net 4.5 and you can put it anywhere you like and add it to your Windows startup.

Now that both consoles will run on an X86 instruction set, I'm guessing there will be some checks in the code to say ""Hey, is this an Xbox?"" or ""Hey is this CPU that is in an ps4?"" but without those said code would run on a PC.  On the graphics side I believe ( Limited knowledge warning ) that consoles do not use direct X libraries that windows uses ( although for the Xbox they might considering they already have it ... ) so that might throw a wrench into an easy conversion process...

I have to manually switch to full power (choose the regular power plan) then run some crazy app that heats up the CPU, close it and switch back to Slowpoke. I don't know why, but this forces the retarded hardware to notice the temperature is dropping, and stop the fan.

In conclusion, I'm still looking for a way to have a reliably quiet machine.",,False,,t5_2qh19,True,,,True,t3_bmrsf,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/bmrsf/hey_reddit_i_discovered_you_can_throttle_your_cpu/,

The 'usual' process on Win 7 at the moment is to make an updating program run in the background and when updates are available bring up a promt which links to the general download webpage. There the user have to manually browse to the correct version, download an installer exe (which clogs up the download directory) and go through all the usual steps of disabling icons on the desktop, organizing start menu items etc.

Some programs can do it all automatically (Chrome, the FTB launcher, Steam etc.) but even very well coded applications can't (VLC, qbittorrent, EasyPHP, KeePass etc). Some not-so-well-coded applications are even worse (iTunes, Java).

I know that Windows is built with a registry and not a dependency structure like Linux where you can run apt-get or the like, but why is it so hard to make something that is not an annoyance for the users when it clearly can be done?

Sorry if this sounds like a rant, I'm genuinely curious to hear Reddits take on this.

EpicRewind is video capture software that has a key differentiating feature: RAM RollingBuffer mode. This works like an on-demand instant-replay: a game is hooked and the video is continuously buffered in system RAM, when something cool happens the user can save the buffer contents with the press of a hotkey. So rather than saving video from your entire gaming session you can just save the good stuff after it actually happens. In addition, EpicRewind provides some nice performance benefits over traditional capture software: video processing, encoding and writing to disk only happen when you choose to save a video clip. During video buffering, the contents of the framebuffer are just being copied to system memory X times per second based your specified capture FPS.

Key advantages of the RAM RollingBuffer:

- You don't need to pre-plan a gaming video, you can just play the game without thinking of the video at all. If something interesting happens you can always choose to save it after it's happened.
- Ideal for MMOs and Multiplayer games where 99% of the gameplay isn't worth sharing and the interesting stuff can happen at unexpected times.

Added benefits:

- One of the best benefits is that it saves you time by eliminating the need to dig through all your saved gameplay footage to find the good stuff.
- Saves disk space by not writing countless hours of video to disk your just going to throw away later after you dig out the highlights.
- More efficient use of system resources by not processing and encoding video the entire time your gaming.

You can find more information about EpicRewind here on our website along with some demonstration videos:

http://epicrewind.com

We are at the point now where we have a usable beta build and are looking for more folks to try it out. If this sounds interesting to you feel free to send me a PM and Ill get you signed up, alternatively you can also email me at:

contact@epicrewind.com

If you really like the idea, we've just launched a Kickstarter for the project here:

My understanding is it's the new webkit Opera. My verdict so far: the thing doesn't make sense. Why anyone would need another Chrome with the Opera logo in the top left hand corner is completely beyond me. 

The worst thing about Opera Next is that practically all of the features that long time Opera users appreciate most and have come to depend on over the years are either very well hidden or completely gone in Opera Next: there is no handy key button that allows you to choose which login + password combo to submit to a website that requires you to sign in - a most convenient feature if, for instance, you have several google accounts; the button that allows you to open recently closed tabs is gone; pop-up ads now open as separate windows instead of just being blocked; and last but not least you can't group tabs. 

My question is why? OK, you wanted to migrate your browser to webkit, I can understand that, webkit is popular, but why go and remove the very features that made your browser stand out of the crowd and that, essentially, were what made using Opera worth it? 

Opera's always been a niche browser, used primarily by geek types who appreciated the unique features it offered and now those unique features are gone we might as well switch to Chrome. Opera Next does not make sense. Do we really need another webkit browser? ",,False,,t5_2qh19,False,,,True,t3_1gygqw,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1gygqw/opera_next_makes_no_sense/,

Herding brain damaged cats doesn't describe the issues I've had with our recently employed vendor since January. 

I pointed out that our testers had expressed concern in the first release that what we'd asked for wasn't exactly what we got. They supposedly understood this and provided a second release that 'met our needs'.

When it was pointed out again....their 'configuration enhancements' weren't meeting requirements they requested a meeting, to which my, by now quite angry (he'd employed them...) stakeholder ('Dave') came along. I gave them a list of  the requirements they failed to meet so far and we began to go through each point. By the second point, their part owner (and supposedly) lead ""guru"" developer became somewhat agitated, looked me straight in the eye and said, ""But the requirements are just a guide aren't they?"".

There's not many times in my career I've been speechless - and before words would appear in my head, Dave pushed himself away from the table, stood up and turned towards the door. As he opened it, (and I thought this was worthy of film accolades) said, ""you'll be hearing from our lawyers. DougieMac, call security and have these people escorted from the building"" and left.

Earlier this year I saw an album on one of the subreddits that was filled with just under 200 images and I wanted them all. I searched for an easy way to achieve this and came up short. There were a couple software options available that I just didn't like or that didn't do what I needed it to, so I created Imgdl (Imgur Album Downloader). Currently windows only.


With it's current version at v0.34, there were some great changes thanks to the users who voiced their opinions and request more functionality. The current version not only allows you to download an entire album, but also an Imgur user's entire album collection! You simply need to enter their user name after selecting the download type.


Some ideas I had looking forward with this project are album queuing, download images from other sources like Tumblr, Blogger etc.


So thank you to those who do use this app. If you haven't tried it and you have a need to grab an entire Imgur album, you can download it here: [ronfitzgerald.com](http://ronfitzgerald.com).

1266987384.0,29,self.software,b5rc6,Should I go with Avast or Microsoft Essentials?,,40,11,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/b5rc6/should_i_go_with_avast_or_microsoft_essentials/,"I have been relatively happy with the newer avast (the single orange icon is much less clutter then two icons in the taskbar) with its performance enhancements and the like; and the silent gaming mode that blocks popups coming from avast when you got a fullscreen app running (even if you have to enable it manually, its still nice).

However in doing some recent reading and comparison study I've found that in fact, Microsoft Security Essentials might be just as good, if not a better option for malware protection.

My main concerns are computer performance and malware detection rates, in that order.

However I found a site - av comparatives here on reddit recently and this is what has mainly led me to believe (in combination with reading recommendations for using Microsoft security essentials) that it might be a good idea to switch.

First off, the December 09 report on malware detection rates puts Microsoft essentials at a slightly higher detection rate (with few false positives) than what avast had scored. Comparatively, they [both scored almost the same](http://www.av-comparatives.org/images/stories/test/performance/performance_dec09.pdf) on the December 09 performance review.

So I'm wondering if I should switch or not. What say you, reddit? Has anyone toyed with both products?

**Edit:** The overwhelming opinion is that MSE outperforms Avast!(free) and should be used in its place. If you have a Genuine copy of windows maybe you should consider the switch as well, if your using Avast. Thanks for all your input guys!

**Edit2:** I'm now looking for a good standalone scanner that I can keep handy on a usb stick as well for backup malware protection and portability. Needs to be able to run independently from the usb stick, requiring no install on the host PC its plugged into. Would be nice to have. Hopefully it can have an update feature on it too, to update definitions and stuff, keeping everything on the usb stick.

**What went wrong, what right - and key learning**

Not so good

1: Hosting code on our domain (deskera.com) was a bad, bad idea. Users struggled with downloads speeds (even though we have a grade A hosting provider). 

Learning: github is a better place to host an open source project. No doubt about that. 

2: Code issues and check-ins: It's very easy to confuse prospective users with quick code check-ins. We've decided to have a slow roll-out and a fixed delivery schedule for patches and updates


3: Most users are in the silent majority - we never get to hear from 99% of our users. 


Good things

1: Users love our app, there are no major bugs and we got a good start. 

2: Reddit! The help we got from this community was outstanding.

It also hangs all of my other FF windows.

I'm perplexed as to what it may be doing when it hangs like this.  It can't be waiting for system resources of any kind.  I am running Windows 7/64 Bit, 12 GB RAM, SSD Boot....I continue to have great resposiveness and network throughput on all other apps while this is happening.

- A monitor on my desk
- My bedroom's TV

They're both connected, so they both act as monitors. However, I use the monitor mostly for browsing and writing, while the TV is always used for gaming (I use a wireless keyboard and mouse or a wireless gamepad) on the bed.

Initially, I had some trouble getting games to play on the ""second"" screen, which was the TV. Then I found this utility called [Make Primary Monitor](http://www.syaeger.com/PCUtils/) and binded it to an unused key on my keyboard. So all I have to do now is move the mouse to the TV space and press the key. The TV becomes the primary monitor so all games launched play on it. Whenever I'm ready for some working and browsing, I move the mouse back to the monitor and press that key to change the primary monitor back.

Now, I don't have a problem exactly. This software (which seemed sketchy at first, but has worked flawlessly for almost a year) does its job well, but I'm thinking maybe there are more complete utlity tools out there that allow me to do more.

Some annoyances include lost windows in the wrong monitor and having to drag them from one to the other, losing the task bar on the secondary monitor and the wallpaper becoming wonky (wrong size) once the primary monitor changes.

My question is, are there any better utilities out the for the ones using dual monitors like me?

Most programs are straightforward offerings like LogMeIn, Radmin, TeamViewer, CoPilot and even Window's 'Remote Access'.  They each work slightly differently but -in short- they enable one computer to control another computer for tech support, file display, etc.

Along comes *Ammyy*... out of Moscow... as many excellent programs do as well.  Unfortunately, Ammyy decided on a marketing tactic that is less than forthright.
  
* They have a free version that times out after 15 hours in a month. Fair enough.
 
* They have a Paid version that also times out after 15 hours in a month.  That's bizarre and they charge $30.00+ for it.
 
* They have a Paid version that also times out after 15 hours in a month.  That's unethical since they charge $66.90 for it and fail to disclose you must purchase a copy for every computer you wish to access.

When you realize you've been duped and what you bought from AMMYY is useless unless you buy the same program again and again for every computer, you next find out their policy is to require you fill out a tech support ticket.  What tech support has to do with a refund is beyond me. Fill it out and it disappears.

What I have learned is AMMYY plays fast and loose with their definition of personal vs. commercial use. If you use AMMYY for more than 15 hours a month, they declare you a 'commercial' user and demand you pay for every computer you ever access. They also modify the definition of a functional product and retain the right to change the rules about usability and refund after they have your money.

Of course, I will file a hostile chargeback with the credit card company so -in the end- I will get my money back.  This post is simply to advise any other Redditors who were considering AMMYY to stay away. The Ammyy folks give Russian developers a bad name.

*EDIT:  Update...* **Amex confirms Ammyy will not be paid**. *That's great because Ammyy demanded I smail mail a letter to them in Moscow assuring I deleted the program and agreeing to a $10,000.00 fine if I didn't. No clue how they would enforce that in an American court since the ""damages"" vastly exceed the value of the software.

I have a pretty strict set of requirements, I'm hoping something satisfies them:

 * Instantaneous startup (like notepad, not even a quarter second of delay)

 * Handles windows and unix line breaks

 * Can be called from command line (i.e. ""notepad.exe file.txt"" opens the GUI)

 * No markup (syntax highlighting is okay)

Additional pros would be the program doubling as a hex editor, and autosaving (no data loss if it crashes).

First, it was the Game Save Manager executable. I ran this file through VirusTotal multi-engine online scan and none of the others turned a positive result. The next day, I got a positive result on the Wolfenstein single player executable. I couldn't scan this one at VirusTotal because it exceeds the maximum file size. Today, I'm getting positives for Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit's executable along with its activation executable. The activation exe was below the max file size so [I scanned it](http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=13c93970a036113c212ca15c829b8cd459189c8a5567efde2236f321e9b07852-1299891325). I'm getting three positives on that one.

What is happening here? With only one positive, I was inclined to think AVG's heuristics were a little overzealous, but now, with three engines giving positive results, I'm beginning to wonder. Even so, I'm getting nothing from the other 39 engines VirusTotal uses. Is AVG way ahead of most of the others in detecting these viruses, or is it just plain wrong?

tl;dr- AVG is finding viruses left and right, but many other AV engines seem to disagree. Still, there are a few others which agree with it.

Is there a simple file manager you guys recommend that would be best for what I'm trying to do? Ideal would be something that works like a local FileZilla, where it combs through the file structure of the source drive then initiates a file-by-file transfer to the destination drive that I could monitor and pause/resume.

First of all, the ""Maximize"" button. In Mac, the button doesn't make the windows take all the screen. Instead, the windows get to the size of their content. Is there any software that makes Windows work like that?

Second, there is a visualization option in the Mac Finder (File Explorer)
that lets you browse files in subsequent columns (http://osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mac-os-x-finder-column-view.JPG). Is there any software that lets you browse files like this? Preferrably a Windows File Explorer mod.

GoodSync Connect lets you sync any two computers, regardless of what network or country they are in and sync files between them. I haven’t found any limits on filesize or total number of files that can be synced. Right now I’m syncing over 41,000 files (over 100gb) and everything is working fast and smooth. 

Hopefully this will be a good stand-in for other people who rely on Live Mesh for file syncing.

1. Norton: NO. DO NOT SUGGEST THIS MONSTROSITY.
2. Ad-aware: Seemed to work well, but I haven't used it in years, so it might not be very useful anymore.
3. Spywarebot: Didn't seem to do much of anything.
4. McAfee: It's shiny because it costs money, but it was completely unable to remove my virus and I doubt it's better than a good freeware.

For any other VLC noobs who are trying to do similar, here are the steps I took and the customizations that got me to a working command in Windows XP using VLC media player 1.1.10.  Please feel free to comment and make improvements.

1. In Windows Explorer window, go to the VLC program folder.  Find the folder that the VLC executable is in and copy the path from the Address window to notepad, including the VLC executable name. Ex.  ""C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe""  Use quote marks if there are any spaces.
2. Open VLC.

3. Go to Media --&gt; Streaming.

4. Go to Capture Device tab.

5. Select capture devices.

6. Click on ""Show more options"" checkbox on the bottom.

7. Go to MRL and ""Edit Options"" for your command line information.  My MRL says ""dshow://"" and the ""Edit Options"" window shows "":dshow-vdev=Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX :dshow-adev=Microphone (Logitech Mic (Co  :dshow-caching=200"".  Note that the Microphone name was cut off.  I looked back up at the Audio Device Name on the Capture Device tab and got the full name for it and finished it so that it would read "":dshow-adev=Microphone (Logitech Mic (Communicate STX))""  You may have to do this for your Video or Audio device if the name wasn't fully captured.  Add the MRL and ""Edit Options"" lines after the path on your notepad document.
8. Click on the ""Stream"" button at the bottom of the page and then click on ""Destinations"".  Next to the ""New destination"" window click on the ""Add"" button and then ""Browse"".  I go right to the C: drive for simplicity sake, but create a file name and container type (extension) for the video/audio file you want to create.  I had the most success with ""*.ps"".  Click on the ""Save"" button.
9. Click on the ""Options"" button at the bottom of the ""Stream Output"" window.  Copy the text from the ""Generated stream output string"" window to your notepad document, at the end of the command that you're creating.  Afterwards, I had to replace the back slash in C:\test.ps to a forward slash C:/test.ps.
10. You'll want to change your vb (video bitrate), width, height and maybe other variables to save disk space if you're going to do long recordings.

This is my final command:

""C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"" dshow:// :dshow-vdev=""Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX"" :dshow-adev=""Logitech Mic (Communicate STX)""  :dshow-caching=200 :sout=#transcode{vcodec=h264,vb=400,width=352,height=288,acodec=mp3,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44000}:duplicate{dst=file{dst=C:/test.ps},dst=display} :no-sout-rtp-sap :no-sout-standard-sap :ttl=1 :sout-keep

This is a command using pstools to operate cameras on multiple machines (their computer names go in the file ""file with conputer names"") from another computer on the network (substitute domain, administrator login and password with your own information):

",,29,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/emf9x/got_a_call_today_from_someone_today_found_out_it/,"So I was on my computer when my mom called me in and handed me the phone. An Indian with a very thick accent was telling me that he was calling from Windows Tech Support (red lights went up here) and gave me some BS about their records showing that my computer had picked up some malware, and was clogging up their system. 

I knew it was a scam, but I wasn't sure what kind, so I kept baiting him on. I asked what version of Windows it was, he said he couldn't tell me that information. I told him I have several versions of Windows, and they are all slow, so he gave in and said it was Windows XP.

He told me to type ""Eventvwr"" into Windows Run (it took me a while to figure out what he wanted me to type in, he had a very thick accent, thickest Indian accent I've ever heard). 

After Googling and confirming this was some sort of hack/scam, I told him that I had an incoming call, and that I'd need to call him back. I asked what his number was so that I could return the call, he gave me 1800-3625-32. I don't know what country region number this is, but obviously not US. 

After that he hung up. I looked up the number on our caller ID, and it said it was a TX number. I called this number, and didn't get anything, so I'm guessing it's just masking their real number. 

I was wondering if any one else had similar experiences, and what these people are trying to get from my computer. Is it some kind of key logging (I'm not familiar with Windows Event Viewer)?

Now, the radio shows are streaming on the college's website. I figured I could use a program like Audacity or something similar to record the show. Just hit ""record"" and go from there. However I've noticed that Audacity can pick up other sounds besides the stream. 

Basically I have three questions. One is, what's the best (preferably free) program to record my show? Is Audacity a good program to use? Can I ""single out"" the radio stream in Audacity so I don't have to worry about any possible sounds getting into the recording?

That's the reason why I actually searched for this software.
http://skwire.dcmembers.com/fp/?page=file-punter

What this program does is that you put type of files you want to move from-to, and just start it, it moves files by itself. For example, your desktop is filled with .mp3, .exe, .rar, .jpg etc files, and moving each file to his own ""my documents/filetype"" folder is sometimes time wasting. So you'll use this, make it to check out desktop for those file types, and move each one of them into his own folder, mp3 to My music, jpg to My pictures etc. It has an option of checking out subfolders also, so if you got a folder on desktop that has those files inside, it'll optionally clear them up too. You can also copy files instead of moving them.
I used desktop just as an example, it can help around my documents (or even download folder from your browser) or any other folder you want to clean up and organize.
I hope someone else will find this software useful :)

* I want to have the ability to scan bar codes from my phone using an app that will automatically look it up and feed me back info.

* The app will then give me a list of things I scanned that I can review (adding expiration dates and stuff) and send to a program in my PC that will create an inventory.

* I should be able to access this inventory from my phone (in case I go shopping)

* The application on the computer/phone should allow me to enter some manual ""Everyday Items"" that I should normally have (e.g. bread, milk, and eggs). Adding to this, it should be able to notify me when I ran out of an everyday item (well, if I keep track of usage)

* A weekly ""Shopping List"" would be great!

* The application on the computer should be able to notify me a few days in advance if I have something that will expire soon.

* **Recipes!!** I should also be able to create recipes using the inventory or find some online that can run against my inventory and offer an ""Ingredients Needed List"" and/or an ""Alternatives List"" 

* If I choose to make a recipe, it should be able to let me know how to properly store left overs and give me the a shelf life that can work with the 'expiration notifications'

* I should also be able to enter my own recipes with my own estimated shelf life that can integrate with the system.

* Also the ability to plan out what meals to make, for the week, month, year. Think about it, your kitchen sending you a reminder that you need to buy sweet potatoes for thanksgiving or some tofu for that one cousin that feels the need to be righteous by not eating meat.

* The interface should be easy enough that a Mac user can use it.

* We could work on it, and eventually make it open to let others mess around with it.

* Finally, we should prepare it for automatic scanning using hardware that I can envision, but I doubt I can make due to lack of funds. Essentially it is a touchscreen that goes on shelves and in the fridge that will scan the bottom of items (hopefully the barcodes are on the bottom) and it can tell if you removed an item or added a new item. That would help a lot with the expiration dates, location of items, and allow for better management of food.

Well, that was my brainstorm and I'll share it with you all. Anyone want to help me create it, if it hasn't been done yet?
