I visited the Churchill bunkers in London last year and read about Churchill's badassery of watching the German air raids from the rooftops of Whitehall above his bunker. This would've been roughly the same spot that Bond is standing at the end of Skyfall (above the new subterranean MI6 in the old WWII bunkers). http://i.imgur.com/WVaOT.jpg. Eve says: ""I didn't know you could come up here""

And I don't think it was a coincidence that that's where the little British Churchill bulldog was given to 007. 
Just a theory!

Edit: As that economist article that was posted today talks about, I think this ties in the with the conflict of personal angst vs duty to country that was an underlying theme of the film. Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/13ml64/the_james_bond_question_shaken_stirred_and/

This subreddit is growing every day and I hope that it will continue to grow and that soon we will have another post where we will celebrate 10000 subscribers. 

This subreddit has become a great place for 007 related discussions. From the ""Bond Movie Of The Week Series"" (which will continue in few hours btw) to the rumours about Bond24. From the posts about your Bond related stuff to your thoughts about SkyFall and asking the questions about your fave Bond movies this place has become a go to place for every redditor that is fan of the 007 franchise.

And it's all because of you. The fans and subscribers of /r/JamesBond . So don't go anyway, don't run away. Cause nothing good happens when you jump and run away. [All that jumping,and fighting is exhausting](http://i.imgur.com/DCnSfHF.gif).So stay here and enjoy the Bond experience.

You can use this thread to share your fave things from this subreddit and give your suggestions to improve the subreddit.

Also in this thread your ideas for next upvote and downvote buttons may become a reality. If you are good with reddit's CSS upload a picture of what can be used as a up/downvote button and we might end up using it.

Once again thank you, and we hope that you will continue to contribute to this subreddit, and make this subreddit the best place for the Bond fans to share their thoughts about Bond24,25,26 and so on,and so on.

A big part of the film is how MI6 is no longer in the ""golden age of espionage"", and have to learn to move with the times. Much like the old warship is no longer in its golden age. However, the events of the film shows that MI6 is still a vital part of Britain's national security, and cannot be written off so easily.

This change is represented in the final scene in M's office, where (Spoiler in picture) [a picture on the wall](http://i.imgur.com/BmzJZjP.jpg) shows a line of battleships heading out to war, meaning MI6 is back to its full glory and ready to take on whomever dares cross their path.

After the light Moore movies filed with silly moments Bond becomes darker and ruthless. 

Timothy Dalton made 2 movies as Bond and was prepared to do a 3rd one (007 in New York) but MGM had some big money problems which caused the movie to be canceled.

So instead of 3 we got 2 dark and ruthless Bond movies.

The first movie of the Dalton Era is **The Living Daylights**. In this movie Bond has to chase an evil arms dealer in order to stop the next world war. Will Bond succeed ? 

The Bond girl in this movie is Maryam d'Abo and IMO Bond and Kara Milovy (her character's name) have interesting chemistry together.

Dalton's first delivery of the iconic [Bond.James Bond](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raplvZFysjU#t=33s) is either loved or hated. There is no between (or is there?). So I want to hear your opinion on his delivery of the iconic line.

Overall this movie is enjoyed by most of the Bond fans (but there are still fans who don't like the movie), so it should be interesting to see where this movie will end up in our movie table.

And while we are talking about our movie table let's see the updated table:

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
4. | 8.2 | Dr.No
5. | 8.0 | For Your Eyes Only
6. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
7. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
8. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
9. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
10. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
11. |5.1 |MoonRaker
12. | 4.6 | Octopussy
13. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

So Octopussy just barely misses on the last spot. Will there be a movie that will get worse rating than DAF? Only time will tell.

In this thread give your rating for A View To A Kill.

Also let me remind you that the April Madness final is under way and that this Wednesday we will announce the winner.

1363608878.0,28,self.JamesBond,1aiqke,Bond Movie Of The Week: The Man With The Golden Gun,dragonsky,32,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1aiqke/bond_movie_of_the_week_the_man_with_the_golden_gun/,"[**The Man With The Golden Gun**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzt6zAj7XUM) is this weeks Bond Movie Of The Week. 

After starting the new Bond era last week with LALD we continue our Moore Bond adventure with another mission.

In this adventure Moore's nemesis is Christopher Lee who is portraying Scaramanga.Francisco Scaramanga. The hitman who can not miss. The special thing about Scaramanga besides that is that he owns a golden gun, he has a private island, and he has a servant named Nick Nack.

The entire adventure climaxes when [this](http://aboutthailandliving.com/files/2009/09/scaramanga-bond.jpg) happens (warning some of you might consider this a spoiler).

There is not much to say about this movie who by many people is not memorable. Besides Nick Nack and Scaramanga this Bond adventure is not really memorable (just like the other Moore flicks IMO).


[***The Man With The Golden Gun***](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071807/) is the 9th movie about the agent 007 and is based off the 12th [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Gun_(novel)) about James Bond from Ian Fleming. 

Besides the role of Christopher Lee another thing that I like in the movie is the [theme song](The Man With the Golden Gun Theme Song). Very underrated Bond theme song IMO.

So did you enjoyed the movie? What about the book? Tell your story about TMWTGG below :)


And now for something completely different.

The table of Bond movies that I really hope you are waiting for every week :D

Last week you voted for Diamonds Are Forever and it seems like you..well....not liked the movie...that much..

Let's see the updated table

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | Dr.No
4. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
5. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
6. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
7. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever


I doubt that we are going to have a movie with worse result that that. Or are we?

In the comment section write your rating for Live And Let Die and that movie only.

Don't forget to upvote the thread for visibility.

And one last thing. Would you like to have a tournament of Bond movies once the ""Bond Movie Of The Week"" series is over?

1376399693.0,31,self.JamesBond,1k9xlp,Bond Of The Week: Timothy Dalton,dragonsky,36,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1k9xlp/bond_of_the_week_timothy_dalton/,"After Moore became too old to be Bond, MGM had to find a new actor to be our favorite spy. In the end that guy turned out to be Mr. Timothy Dalton.

Timothy Dalton turned out to be one of the most brutal Bonds which is either a turn on or turn off for someone. He is a Bond that you either like or don't like and maybe that is the reason why Timothy Dalton is not one of the most famous Bonds.

Timothy Peter Dalton was born on March 21, 1946 in Colwyn Bay, Wales, United Kingdom. As a young teenager Dalton's career path seemed destined toward military service. His father had served in Special Operations during World War II, and the youthful Dalton had his eye on becoming an Air Cadet.

But at the age of 16, Timothy Dalton saw a performance of Shakespeare's Macbeth that changed his life. He connected with a national youth theater group and spent his summers traveling around England. After high school, Dalton enrolled at the esteemed Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. But restless and eager to break free from what he'd later describe as the ""oppressive"" nature of the school's teachers, Dalton left RADA after just two years of study.

It didn't take long for him to find work. Dalton, with his tall frame and classic dark looks, became a darling of a number of BBC dramas and in 1968 broke into film with The Lion in Winter, which featured an all-star cast of Peter O'Toole, Katherine Hepburn, and a young Anthony Hopkins.

At the age of 22, Dalton was approached about succeeding Sean Connery in the James Bond series. Feeling as though he was too young for the part, the actor turned the offer down.

Instead, the perfectionist in Dalton returned him to the theater, where for much of the first half of the 1970s he stayed busy and continued to further hone his craft.
By the early 1980s, Dalton had raised his profile again. He had a number of guest appearances on American television, including the program Charlie's Angels, and ingratiated himself with sci-fi fans as Prince Barin in Flash Gordon (1980).

In the mid-1980s, Dalton was again approached about playing James Bond. Coming off of a disappointing box-office showing with A View to a Kill (1985), the franchise was stumbling and needed an injection of energy. This time Dalton said yes.

After his two Bond movies MGM promised Dalton a third Bond movie ""007 in New York"" but MGM got into financial problems so this had to be called off. 

In the years since the Bond films, Dalton has explored a range of different kinds of projects.

In 1994 he stepped in as Rhett Butler in the CBS miniseries and Gone With the Wind sequel, Scarlett, then donned the role of Julius Caesar in the ABC miniseries Cleopatra (1999). More recently he had a semi-regular role opposite Linda Hamilton in the NBC series Chuck.

On the big screen, Dalton has continued to stay busy. He co-starred in the comedy flick Hot Fuzz (2007) (If you haven't already, check this one out) and was the voice of Mr. Pricklepants in Toy Story 3 (2010).

In his private romantic life Timothy Dalton, whose romantic companions have included Vanessa Redgrave and Whoopi Goldberg, is married to the Russian pianist and songwriter, Oksana Grigorieva. They have a son together, Alexander Dalton, who was born August 7, 1997.

So what do you think about Dalton as Bond, actor and as a person ? Were 2 movies enough for him ? Are you happy with his portrayal as Bond ? Would've you liked to see his third movie ""007 in New York"" ?

Next week we have a new Bond actor as we are getting into the modern Bond. Until then stay safe and Bond on.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,GG,True,t3_1k9xlp,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1k9xlp/bond_of_the_week_timothy_dalton/,moderator

As a result, I started to drink more heavily. Rather than my old routine of a Scotch a night and a Vesper on rough nights, I started drinking a Vesper AND a Scotch. Well, to save time and alcohol (because Kina L'Avon D'Or is expensive and I'm in the military), I came up with my OWN mix, named after a beautiful woman who stole and broke my heart. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: The Keeley. Or, as my roommate and I like to call it, The Angry Bitch.


Three measures Gordon's London Dry Gin, one and one-half measure Russian Standard Vodka (only because of the intense amount of Cyrillic printed on the label), one (or two) measures Scotch of your choice (though it's best taken with Dewar's White Label)

Combine and shake with three ice cubes, serve in a chilled red wine glass.

Explanation within.",Veggieleezy,28,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/17wjsj/dr_no_as_litmus_test_for_bond_explanation_within/,"I have a theory about the Bond series and determining which films one is more likely to enjoy without having seen any of the others.

Suppose you wanted to introduce a friend to the series who had never seen any of the movies before, which one would you choose? Everyone will likely have their own answer, but in my opinion I'd always show Dr. No first and here's why.

Not only is it the first movie in terms of continuity and the series in general, but it sets the formula for all of the subsequent films. It has (nearly) all of the ingredients for a ""Bond film"": the car chase, the fight scenes, the Girl, the Ally character(s), the big baddie, the lesser henchman baddie, final climax battle, and Bond shagging women.

Now, my theory is that since this is the first film to have these elements, it has them to the least degree of exaggeration; the series had yet to work out where it was going and which elements to play up or play down, so everything is at what I think of as the ""base level"". 

From here, you can find out what your friend thought of the movie, asking about which elements they liked, or which they disliked. Depending on their answers, you can point them towards the proper ""era"" for what they'd like.

They want a lighter-hearted movie? Point them to Roger Moore. More aggressive? Timothy Dalton. More gadget-y? Pierce Brosnan. More character development? Daniel Craig, or even George Lazenby. Keep it more or less the same? Keep it with Sean Connery.

Just my thoughts, at least. I could very well be wrong in my descriptions of each actor's era; I'm working through the series and I've just finished *For Your Eyes Only*, so I can't form a proper personal opinion on Dalton or Brosnan yet, but from what I've seen that's the vibe I get from them.

1376591224.0,28,self.JamesBond,1kfmy9,Why Casino Royale is the best Bond film ever - My thoughts,nafaaan,33,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1kfmy9/why_casino_royale_is_the_best_bond_film_ever_my/,"Let's begin with the villain, Le Chiffre. He's looks like your typical Bond villain - he wears suits, he's smart, he's ruthless, he hates Bond, and he has a strange deformity/feature. Like Jaw's teeth, or Tee-Hee's hooked hand, Le Chiffre's left eye weeps blood when he's bluffing in Poker... Genius. This feature of him isn't one of villainy, it's actually one of weakness, and it certainly isn't there to just provide a decent tool in a fight scene. Le Chiffre is shown to be as much a victim as anyone else. His plan to blow up an airbus is foiled by Bond 30 minutes into the film. This in turn forces machete-wielding African militia to come and threaten him to the point of asphyxiation. And of course, he dies pleading for more time to gather money together 30 minutes before the end. All in all, he's not a very cold, calculating villain, he's actually a ruthless businessman, desperately trying to pay back people much more intimidating than himself. In all classic Bond films, the main villain and Bond have some kind of final conflict. Drax being pushed into an airlock in space in Moonraker, Dr. Kananga's untimely meeting with a shark gun pellet which causes him to blow up like a blimp. The finale for Casino Royale involves Le Chiffre torturing Bond's private parts, before someone bursts in and shoots him. 

The whole film felt to me like it had 'grown up'. For the first time we see Bond *get* his 00 status. The whole film feel's very 'film noir', beautifully illustrated by the black and white introduction. For the second time in the series, Bond is shown to actually care for a woman. Sure, Craig has his fair share of steamy scenes, but his and Vesper's relationship feels 'real', and she betrays him in a terrible way. Bond is heartbroken by it, and this is something I'm sure all audience members can relate to. The classic elements are of course all there - the women, the cars, the guns. But with the recent films, they've flipped it on it's head. As Q says in Skyfall, *""Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't go in for that any more.""* Some fans may object, but I find this incredibly refreshing.

Bond is smart, and suave, and Casino Royale is centred all around a high-stakes Poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro. You can't get more suave than that. In previous instalments, Felix Leiter was shown to be rather hopeless individual, killed off by sharks in Licence To Kill.  Jeffrey Wright plays him as an equally suave, level-headed individual, although more of this is shown in Quantum of Solace. All in all, Casino Royale gave rise to the view that Bond and '007' are code names, not a single man effortlessly killing villains and bedding women over a period of 40 years. He feels, he bleeds, and he's human. The whole Craig franchise has given a personality to Bond beyond spouting catchphrases and outsmarting baddies; he's now a real person with a past and a future, cloudy as it may be.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,1376591424.0,,SeanConnery,True,t3_1kfmy9,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1kfmy9/why_casino_royale_is_the_best_bond_film_ever_my/,

MGM had some serious financial problems after Licence To Kill. They planned the next Bond movie to be *007 in New York* starting Dalton as Bond but MGM couldn't afford to make the movie. The future of James Bond was in jeopardy. And 16 years after the last Bond movie 007 returned on his golden tracks he once was on. New Bond was casted in the name of Pierce Brosnan and the new era of Bond was ready to begin.

Judging from the comments on the other threads **GoldenEye** and/or Brosnan as Bond was the reason many people started to get into Bond.

This movie was 17th MGM movie about 007 and it started Pierce Brosnan as 007.Besides him the role of Bond girl in this movie was played by the lovely Famke Janssen in the role of the iconic Xenia Onatopp. The other girl in this Bond adventure was Izabella Scorupco who was playing the role of Natalya Simonova. Besides the lovely girls we also got another lovely actor who got a role in this movie. The colleague of Bond- Alec Trevelyan, another 00 agent who was portrayed by Lord Stark himself-Sean Bean. Also another iconic thing in this movie was the theme song by Tina Turner titled simply as [**GoldenEye**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkBYVNrjjIs).

The plot of the movie was typical old school Bond plot. The bad guys are the Russians. Altough in 1995 the Cold War was over the 007 movie universe found a way to make the Russians the villains in this movie and it totally worked.Bond had to team up with the lone survivor of a destroyed Russian research center to stop the hijacking of a nuclear space weapon.

So good plot, good actors, good theme song.What could go wrong? Nothing, as GoldenEye was one of the most popular Bond movies of all time and it made great profit by rebooting Bond perfectly and putting him back on the track. Also GoldenEye was a movie who wasn't made by a novel. In the case of **GoldenEye** the movie was novelized after it came out. You can read more about the movie here: http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/GoldenEye_(novelisation)

As I said many people first time were introduced to Bond by **GoldenEye**. Some people were introduced to the world of 007 by playing the great game for Nintendo- [**GoldenEye**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MfGADWXQs).

Not many people know that she was a Bond  girl. She appeared at the end of the Bond movie of this week.**For Your Eyes Only** [LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf67SPzC3tQ)

**For Your Eyes Only** is the 12th movie about 007 and it features Roger Moore as James Bond just like the previous 4 Bond movies. 

In this mission 007 is assigned to hunt for a lost British encryption device and prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

This movie is memorable for the [poster](http://www.wearebulletproof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/For-your-Eyes-Only.jpeg) that was made to promote the movie (and few weeks ago someone said that there was Swedish/Nordic porno with familiar poster). 

**For Your Eyes Only** is another movie made by a Fleming novel but unlike the other Bond movies For Your Eyes Only is a name of a novel which contains short stories. That is the first book by Fleming about 007 that features short stories about 007. It contains 5 short stories: For Your Eyes Only,Risico,Hildebrant rarity,From a View to a kill and Quantum of Solace.

Overall this movie (much like the other Bond movies of Moore's era) is not among the best 007 movies. I'm looking forward to your reviews about this movie.

A week where you can debate, review and share your thoughts on the Bond movie of the week. You suggested that we should review the movies as they were releases and so we are. 

The first (official) movie about Fleming's agent 007 was [**Dr.No**.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055928/)


The first actor who portrayed the famous British spy was (as some people refer to him ""The Bond himself"" ) Sean Connery. His portrayal of Bond in **Dr.No** was absolutely amazing. 

Connery's badassery combined with the stunning beauty of Ursula Andress and the exotic locations made this movie a huge success.

After that everything else is just a history, a 50 year history, a history that will be written forever in the books. And it all started with this movie.

With the mоvie where Mr.Bond has to investigate a case in Jamaica about a missing colleague, a case that will turn out to be much more than what Bond expected it to be.

Jamaica, Dr.No, Mrs. Honey Rider , M, Felix Leiter. Truly a great beginning to a great franchise.

So all of you have a one week to participate in this thread with your thoughts/reviews of the movie. 

All of  you that already saw the movie once (or numerous times) can watch the movie again and remember the awesomeness, and the newer fans that never saw [**Dr.No**](http://www.jamesbond-shop.com/dr_no_poster007.jpg) can watch it for first time and experience Bond as never before.

This movie does not need no special introduction as it's the last and the most successful Bond movie (of all time). 

After *Quantum of Solace* some rumours surfaced that MGM are in bad financial position and that they might not be able to finance the 23rd Bond movie. Thankfully the rumours were just that, a rumours so 4 years after the disappointment named *Quantum of Solace* we got our next Bond movie.

The director for this movie was Sam Mandes, and he paired with Roger Deakins produced a beautiful movie that was liked by the Bond and non-Bond fans, and was well perceived by the critics as well. Overall this movie was huge success on the box-office which encouraged MGM to announce that Bond24 will hit the cinemas 2014 or 2015 (most likely). But that' a different story.  

**SkyFall** was the 3rd Bond adventure for Daniel Craig. Dame Judi Dench was M while Bond's nemesis in **SkyFall** was the Academy award winner Javier Bardem.  Without spoiling something I'll let you take over from now on as I'll like to hear your thoughts on the latest Bond adventure. Have you seen the movie in cinema ? If yes how many times?

That's right guys we have another Bond movie starting Pierce Brosnan for our BMOTW. **The World Is Not Enough** is the 19th movie in the James Bond series and is (one of) my favourite Bond movie(s).


Again just like the previous 2 movies about 007 Pierce Brosnan is playing the role of Bond and Judy Dench is portraying Bond's boss M.

Without spoiling anything for those who haven't seen the movie I'll say that Bond in **The World Is Not Enough** uncovers a nuclear plot when he protects Elektra King an oil heiress (who is played by the lovely Sophie Marceau) from her former kidnapper Renard, who was believed to be dead.

Bond in this movie gets not one but 2 Bond girls as Denise Richards is playing Dr. Christmas Jones. Also in this movie we witness the last appearance of Q played by Desmond Llewelyn. Will Q get an replacement? Will Bond save the world? Will he seduce both Elektra and Christmas ? Does Christmas comes once a year? Can Renard feel pain? Can he be stopped? 

The answers too all these and more questions can be find in **The Worlds Is Not Enough**.

Fun fact: **The World Is Not Enough** or on latin : **Orbis Non Sufficit** is the family motto of the Bond family. This is first mentioned in the movie *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*.

And now it's time to see how you've rated *GoldenEye*, the movie(/game) that made many people fall in love with the 007 franchise. Will the movie be high up on our table? Let's see:

  # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.7 | GoldenEye
3. | 8.6 | Licence To Kill
4. | 8.4 | The Living Daylights
5. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
6. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
7. | 8.2 | Dr.No
8. | 8.0 | For Your Eyes Only
9. | 7.8 | ThunderBall

14. | 5.6 | A View To A Kill
15. |5.1 |MoonRaker
16. | 4.6 | Octopussy
17. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

Well it seems like the gold always goes to the top as *GoldenEye* takes our 2nd top spot on our table just behind *GoldFinger*. Is there a movie that can change the top 2? 

For the next week give your review for **The World Is Not Enough** and your *rating* for *Tomorrow Never Dies*.

I hope you are enjoying these threads, and I look forward to hearing your opinions about the threads :)

Next week we are ending the era of Brosnan with one of the most controversial (so to speak) Bond movies of all time. Until then stay safe and Bond on.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,GG,True,t3_1f5w50,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1f5w50/bond_movie_of_the_week_orbis_non_sufficit/,moderator
1364219948.0,25,self.JamesBond,1az169,Bond Movie Of The Week:The Spy Who Loved Me ,dragonsky,26,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1az169/bond_movie_of_the_weekthe_spy_who_loved_me/,"Triple X starting Vin Diesel.....no, no, no, that can't be right...

Let us start again:

[**The Spy Who Loved Me**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-c8aAntWA) is our next BMOTW. 

And Roger Moore is in another adventure,who might be his best so far (IMO it's better than his previous 2 and it is maybe the best in Moore's era). **The Spy Who Loved Me** is a movie known for the amazing pre-title sequence which made people talk about the movie. I won't spoil the movie for those who didn't watched it, but I'll say that watching this movie in 2013 won't do that scene justice as watching it in 1977)

In this adventure James Bond has to investigate the hijacking of Russian and British submarines. This will lead to KGB sending their best agent to work together with Bond. It is Agent XXX. No, no, that's not a role played by Vin Diesel. Luckily for us Agent XXX is played by the lovely Barbara Bach. As this double-oh adventure rolls on Bond and Anya (XXX) will found that there is more between them than just being cold killers and agents for their bosses.

[**The Spy Who Loved Me**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_(novel)) is another Bond movie based on the Ian Fleming's novels about James Bond. This novel is not counted as one of Fleming's best novel by some people but I would still recommend reading it, cause reading the original Bond novels is fun :).


And now it is time for the results of the last week.

Last week you gave your ratings for Live And Let Die and we got a record number of votes so far. Let's see how LALD finished on our table so far.

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | Dr.No
4. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
5. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
6. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
7. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
8. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

So LALD finished at the 7th place so far. The next movie for you to give your ratings is The Man With The Golden Gun so please in the comments give your ratings for that movie only. (judging by the thread from last week i think that DAF might not be the last place)


Also If you noticed we are trying to change the upvote and downvote buttons on the thread. So if you are good with reddit CSS message the MODs with a pic you think that will be good to be used as a downvote button. (and other stuff you think that will help us).

Also starting next week a tournament will start on /r/JamesBond 

April Madness ! You will get to choose the best Bond theme song. 

The matchups will probably be revealed next Wednesday.

Till next week, stay safe and Bond on.

1352697437.0,24,self.JamesBond,131s5t,(spoiler skyfall) My interpretation and opinion on skyfall's ending,chives177,28,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/131s5t/spoiler_skyfall_my_interpretation_and_opinion_on/,"I took the ending as highly metaphorical and it makes sense for Bond and M. Them getting away from the city and potential traps makes sense to me. The home alone thing did seem kinda weird at first, but what else is Bond going to do? Really. He has two old people and a hunting rifle. The situation seemed more desperate to me, and considering what Bond, Kincade, and M were facing, that sure felt like the right emotion to me. It's admittedly different, but different isn't always bad.

The whole movie questioned the legitimacy of the role Bond plays in the world. Bond goes through a dying and rising at the very beginning of the movie, but really he comes back because he realizes that he cares for M, not as an affirmation of his role in the world which is what Bond thinks. There are tons of scenes where Bond is trying to prove he can still do it because he thinks that this is about his position in the world, but the comeback is actually personal vindication (and I think awesome for Dench's last Bond movie...Bond really does care about M.) 

Keep in mind that the hearing isn't about M either; MI6 and M and Bond are ALL on trial. Bond's role isn't the only one being questioned. M basically says that wars are no longer fought in the open (so very fitting for modern times. It's true!) they are fought in the shadows. It is fitting that M and Bond should face the enemy on the periphery of society then. You'll notice that so much of the skyfall scene is dark, shadow like. This is where modern wars will be fought, not under the bright lights of London, but in the shadows. Away from technology too, I might add. There's a distinct lack of computer hacking technology that seems to permeate everything else in the movie. 

(I'm still processing this part so it's kinda rough) It is also Bond's home, and this is significant too. Remember when as a child, Bond went into the ~~batcave~~ secret passage, he came out a new man. The same thing happens again. Bond is the one to truly destroy his old home, and he finally leaves behind his childish notions. It seemed weird to me that Bond was taking orders from M at the start of the movie and that he seemed so concerned about his wounded comrade in the intro. I think we're seeing a more mature Bond, and the destruction of his childhood house is just a big symbol of that. When M dies, I really think Bond is emotionally rent. I always saw Bond as the consummate rebel (James Dean notwithstanding,) and I think Bond--for the first time--really truly gets it and accepts M with all of her sins. I think Bond realizes he loves her (like a mother) and can accept her for who she is because they are both one and the same. The end isn't supposed to be some big spectacle and it's not about Silva or mastermind schemes. This is about Bond. And M. This is intimate. 
Thus the small location. 

Silva is Bond's foil. They are both agents who worked under M. They both get betrayed by M. Silva in China and Bond while on the train. The betrayal is debatable, but M still tells Naomie Harris to shoot even though Bond is in clear danger of getting shot. Silva can't let go and get over M; he's obsessed. Silva can't do what Bond can, and that's why Bond is the hero. 

And, finally, the opening ending. We have the opening gunshot at the end. This is because, once again, Bond is reborn. It's another beginning. This time as a more mature, well-rounded individual. Bond is back. 

In the end, Skyfall says something, and that's why I like it. The essential message is that people matter, that technology can't solve everything. I love that this movie has a message. It seems too many action movies forget they are stories and not just montages of explosions and boobs. Remember that this is one man's interpretation of Bond. Sam Mendes is the director and its his vision, we just get to decide whether we like his vision.

**edit: [**Tomorrow Never Dies**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120347/)
 is the 2nd movie about 007 starting Pierce Brosnan as Bond. Following the huge success that *GoldenEye* bought to the *""rebooted""* Bond franchise MGM wanted to build on that success by making another well received movie. Sadly they failed. This movie for some of the fans is a movie that had the potential to be something big but in the end this Bond flick is one of the more forgettable 007 movies. Brosnan is pretty good as Bond as usual but this movie (much like Brosnan's entire run as Bond) fails to bring the spotlight to Brosnan's performance as Bond. The lackluster script, experimenting with Asian Bond girl that is equal to Bond and the forgettable Mr.Carver as villain are part of the problems that** **Tomorrow Never Dies** **had. Besides Brosnan as Bond and Jonatan Pryce as Elliot Carver this movie also has Michelle Yeoh as Wai Lin as the main Bond girl and pre-Desperate Housewifes Teri Hatcher as Paris Carver. Will Bond spend one night in Paris? Can he stop Mr. Carver's plan to start a war between China and UK using the media? Can BBC bring the tomorrow's news today? Was my last question random?** 

**You can find the answers to some of this question in the 1997 Bond flick Tomorrow Never Dies**.  **Next week we are getting closer to the new Millenium Bond when my personal fave *Orbis Non Sufficit* is our Bond Movie Of The Week.**


For now post your review for **Tomorrow Never Dies** and your rating for GoldenEye.

And now let's see how you've rated Licence To Kill:

This time there will be no rankings or numbers. All you have to do is have your say about the actors that portrayed 007. Did you think that they were right for the choice ? Do you think that they portrayed their own version of Bond or where they closer to Fleming's Bond. Who would you cast as Bond instead of the Bond actor of the week ? Did you liked his movies ? Do you like him as an actor ? etc. etc.

Our first Bond of the week is the most iconic Bond, the Bond that started it all. The man himself: Sean Connery.

Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Scotland. In the 1950s, he was cast in numerous films and television programs, but he gets his breakthrough in the early 1960s where he gets the role of the agent known as James Bond. Sean was supposed to play the role of 007 in the ecranisation of Ian Fleming's novel ""Dr.No"". Sean was lucky to get this role cause many actors were considered for the role but in the end Mr. Connery became Bond.James Bond.

For MGM and Mr. Broccoli Sean was good choice for 007. And they definitely did not made a mistake in casting the man from Scotland as the most suave agent of them all. Sean was not only suave on but he was also suave off the screen. For example as a true gentleman he decided to help the young and a little bit scared Nordic beauty known as Ursula Anders to get more comfortable for the role.

In the beginning noone expected that the ""Dr.No"" will be a beginning of a phenomena that will go on for the next 50 years and it will be inspiration for millions around the world.

The success of the James Bond movies huge so it's obvious that Sean Connery reprised the role that bought him world fame 4 more (official movies) times. After ""Dr. No"" he was Bond in ""Thunderball"", ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia With Love"". After these 4 movies he and MGM did not have successful contract negotiations which did not stopped Sean from portraying the iconic role one more time as he stepped in the shoes and the tuxedo one more time in the non-official (not MGM) Bond movie ""Never say never again"". In meantime MGM had a tough job  to find a replacement for Sean. In the end they decided that the other fella to portray Bond will be George Lazenby. After some misfortunate turn of events (we'll talk about this next week) Lazenby ended up being Bond for only one movie. So MGM had to cast a new Bond. The new Bond was the Bond we all know and love, Mr. Sean Connery. He returned one more time on the big screen when he took the iconic role for the 5th official time in the movie ""Diamods are forever"".

After this movie Sean's adventure as Bond ended forever, but his movie career skyrocketed. Bond helped Connery to become a bigger acting name in the world of the movies. In his great career he was part of many great movies such as : His film career also includes such films as Marnie, The Name of the Rose, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Hunt for Red October, Highlander, Murder on the Orient Express, Dragonheart, and The Rock (not to be confused with Dwayne Johnson).

In his acting career he has won the biggest acting award- the Academy Award (for ""The Untouchables"", two BAFTA Awards (one of them being a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award) and three Golden Globes (including the Cecil B. DeMille Award and a Henrietta Award).

Sean Connery was knighted in July 2000 thus becoming ""Sir"" Sean Connery.

The other titles that Connery has won feature:
""The Greatest Living Scot"" (won a poll) and ""Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure"".In 1989, he was proclaimed ""Sexiest Man Alive"" by People magazine and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted ""Sexiest Man of the Century"".

So there you go. The first Bond actor of this new series. What do you think of the man who started the party called Bond,James Bond ? Do you like him as an actor, Bond, person ? Do you think that MGM made the right choice ? Would Bond be as big as he is today if Connery wasn't Bond in ""Dr. No""?  And most importantly: Do you like this new series?

1366568603.0,24,self.JamesBond,1ct83x,"With all the talk about Bond post-Daniel Craig after the next two films, I wondered what other fans think of what seems to be the big talking point. Should there be -- does there need to be -- a black James Bond?",nutsocharles,40,16,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1ct83x/with_all_the_talk_about_bond_postdaniel_craig/,"Pierce Brosnan has backed Colin Salmon. Lots of talk has surrounded Luther star Idris Elba. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Djimon Hounsou, Morris Chestnut and Harry Lennix were all suggested by The Urban Daily. But the central talking point of which actor should take the reins after Craig has been that the next James Bond might be black. It's an interesting idea, but I believe there are a few unforeseen perils that might come up. Of course it's dangerous ground to discuss the cons of a black Bond because it opens the door to people who would oppose the idea simply out of racism. I don't oppose the idea of a black actor taking the role out of prejudice, but I think the fact that the race of James Bond would become an aspect of at least the first film could present challenges to the filmmakers. 

One aspect that strikes me is how being black would affect who James Bond is. There are a number of great actors who could don the tux, but Bond does have a history and I think a black actor would be a confusing fit in the context of Bond's past. Working for the modern English government makes perfect sense; having an ancestral home in Scotland with a lineage going back centuries in the UK makes little. It's something that would have to be explicitly or presumptively altered about who Bond is. It's also true that Bond was modeled after his creator, Ian Fleming, and the simple truth is that Fleming, and his alter ego Bond, came from a family life and background that few black people living in England would share. However, Bond is also described as having black hair, a trait Daniel Craig does not have, so there is precedent for reinterpreting the model of Bond, and in the modern era the remnants of a class system which still shaped Fleming's world are less and less relevant, so perhaps scrapping Bond's back story and focusing on who he is and what he does would be more fitting and compelling.

Another issue to be dealt with is the bad side of Bond. While he may be the ultimate good guy, Bond is not in all respects a model man.  Although on screen he never takes drugs, he did do so in the novels, but Bond's good qualities have always been tempered by womanizing, drinking, smoking, and generally being a bit of a dick. We love him because he's OUR asshole, but he is an asshole. A big positive of a black James Bond is that it gives black kids a direct connection to an archetypal hero they haven't had before, but the characterization needs to be handled carefully to ensure that Bond's negative actions remain associated with who the character is and not with his race. 

Bond's skin color is never a question in the world created by Ian Fleming. In the original novels Bond views ""negroes"" (in his language) as something apart from the world he occupies. That reality has been altered in our time and in English society today blacks and whites live in the same neighborhoods, go to the same schools, work together, marry and have children. England has more minorities in greater numbers, and for American and global audiences the world is a less Anglo- or Caucasian-centered place. Cultures continue to shift to accepting any person in roles previously restricted to white men. And James Bond remains a popular part of global culture, with the promise of a long continuing future. In that light it becomes inevitable that Bond will change to reflect the modern world, and it seems to me that change should be both embraced and grappled with sooner rather than later. I don't know if the next James Bond needs to be black, but I would say that Bond cannot always be white. Making the move with the next portrayal may be the most sensible. But that actor, whomever he might be, definitely needs to do at least three films, to prevent any sense that the decision was a mistake and to establish that the role remains that of 007, not of a black version of him. The first film will be challenging to many, and keeping the flaws of Bond grounded in the story will be critical; Denzel Washington's performance in Flight could serve as a great blueprint. Ultimately, Bond could be a British symbol that reflects the multicolored tapestry of England today, with Bonds of Indian and West Indian descent; the latter could make for a very interesting tack with Bond's history in Jamaica. So long as the martinis flow and a suave assassin fires a bullet into a gun barrel before saving the world, the color of the man we all want to be or be with should no longer matter.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,DanielCraig,True,t3_1ct83x,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1ct83x/with_all_the_talk_about_bond_postdaniel_craig/,

I didn't think it was as bad of a film as I had believed. It's not as bad as some other Bond films (looking at you, For Your Eyes Only) and it does a good job of continuing the story from Casino. I really like the moments in the film where you can hear Vesper's theme playing. David Arnold did a fantastic job with the score and it's one of my favorite soundtracks of the series. The scene with Bond and Mathis on the plane was done really well (Bond is drinking the Vesper Martini, coined in the previous film. He 'forgot' the name of it and I think it's some damn good character development, not lazy writing.) It's got some good character moments, Bond's still a badass, etc. 

Yes, the film has some weak points, but I don't think it's an atrocity of a film like so many have us believing. People say it's a Bourne clone. It's got more grounded action, yes, but I don't see it as a bad thing.

This year the academy decided that the 23rd MGM movie about our favorite spy deserved 5 nominations. The nominations are for:

Cinematography-Roger Deakins

Original Score-Thomas Newman

Original Song-Adele

Sound Editing-Per Hallerberg and Karen Baker Landers

Sound Mixing-Scott Millan, Greg P. Russell and Stuart Wilson



This year the academy will celebrate the 50 years of Bond. How they are going to do it we don't know but we know that Adele will perform tonight. There are rumors saying that Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey might perform too ! Some light rumors also say that we might see the 6 Bonds tonight too (but don't hold your breath).

So without further ado I pronounce this thread for open. Let the best movie named SkyFall win where they are nominated.

This movie is the 2nd (and last) 007 movie with Dalton portraying the iconic spy. This might be the movie that I've seen the most times, and each time I've loved it.But that is just my opinion.

Licence To Kill is one of the most brutal 007 movies made, it features a scene where if I tell you about I will spoil you the movie. And if you haven't seen the movie you definitely don't want the movie spoiled.

In this movie Bond loses his licence to kill, but that doesn't mean that Bond will just go on vacation. Instead, he grabs his problem by its throat in a mission to get his vengeance.

In this movie we get 2 Bond girls- Pam Bouvier (portrayed by Carey Lowell) and Lupe (portrayed by Talisa Soto).Robert Davi portrays one of the better Bond villains in the name of Franz Sanchez. In **Licence To Kill** we also witness the beginning of the blockbuster career of Benicio Del Toro (his second movie role in his career).

Overall **Licence To Kill** is positively received by the Bond fans worldwide. It's the second Dalton 007 movie and the last Bond movie for a while. But happily the financial problems got resolved and we still have Bond movies after **Licence To Kill**.

So what did you think of [the007 movie to get novelization after its  release?](http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/Licence_to_Kill_(novelisation)) (add ) at the end of the link)

And before you start typing your review of the movie let me remind you that it's time to reveal the result you gave to A View To A Kill:

  # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
4. | 8.2 | Dr.No
5. | 8.0 | For Your Eyes Only
6. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
7. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
8. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
9. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
10. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
11. | 5.6 | A View To A Kill
12. |5.1 |MoonRaker
13. | 4.6 | Octopussy
14. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

So AVTAK is placed on the 11th place. It could be worse but it could be a lot better for Moore's last showing as Bond.

Now let's see what you think of Dalton.

How Craig holds people who have died/about to die:

Craig holds Vesper (Casino Royale) the same way he holds Mathis (QoS): Craig kneeling, the person's head he is holding on his right arm, which is the same way he holds [you know who if you saw the movie](/spoiler)

All three times, they are very important people that have been close to Bond (Mathis being debatable).

Then some stuff in Skyfall, so if you haven't seen it SPOILER

The [bulldog statue on M's desk that 007 gave her survives the entire movie, and is given emphasis. Every time there is a pause, the camera focuses on it. In the end it's given back to Bond as per M's will. I think this connects with what Moneypenny said, ""old dog, new tricks."" The dog survives the explosion at MI6, the impossible, just like Bond survives the shot and the fall from the train. ](/spoiler)

[When James comes back and has to take the marksmanship test, his first shot is to the left of the target. At skyfall, Kincaide says to him, ""remember don't lean left."" And BAM, James shoots both targets perfectly. This could be just coincidence, but I thought that it was a subtle link.](/spoiler)

[Moneypenny says ""yeah maybe we'll have some close shaves in the future"" at the end of the movie, it references the shaving at Macau. I didn't catch that the first time I watched, don't know if you all did](/spoiler)

[Since it was the 50th anniversary, the movie had many references to old movies, notably the old car with the ejector seat, and Q's comment about the exploding pen. After Silva's crew destroyed the old car, I felt like it was the producers saying ""this is a new era, 21st century bond is new, things won't be the same as before!"" It was just something I got out of all these references, and their subsequent destruction (car, and Q's saying that ""we don't do that anymore"")](/spoiler)

Just a few things I found. Feel free to add the pictures to the 007 holding people thing if some don't understand. What I'm specifically referencing is: After 007 saves vesper from the water at the end, where she drowned; after 007 uses Mathis as a human shield; and at the end of Skyfall.

TL;DR- Some cool parallels in the new movies as well as somethings that Craig likes to do, etc.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,,True,t3_17fk9x,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/17fk9x/parallels_between_the_three_recent_movies_and/,

The last Bond movie that starts Roger Moore as Bond. Few years after the release of the movie there were some concerns that it might be the last Bond movie ever. :-O

But as we all know that didn't happen MGM got out of their problems and Bond is still alive and doing great.

In this Bond adventure Roger Moore has to make a investigation on horse races which eventually leads him to one of IMO better Bond villains. Max Zorin. Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) is the reason I like this movie and I think that it is really underrated. In this thread we will find out if you share my opinion.

Max Zorin as an eccentric millionaire he is has an eccentric henchmen. Grace Jones who portrays the role of May Day in this movie.She is far from being your typical Bond girl and she is real danger for James Bond.

Just like FYEO this movie is based on a short story series about James Bond. The name of the novel is ""For Your Eyes Only"" and it contains 5 short stories, one of which is ""From A View To A Kill"".

Have you read this Bond novel? What do you think about the short stories ?

Also another thing you can do in this thread is to rate Octopussy and give your review for A View To A Kill.

Personally, I was actually really surprised. The Activision Bond games have never really done it for me but this one felt pretty fresh IMO. The graphics looked polished enough and not like the game had been thrown together for a quick buck. The gameplay wasn't necessarily innovative but it was actually exciting and sometimes legitimately challenging (but maybe that's just because I don't play too many shooters). Plus, it didn't feel or look like a *Call of Duty* clone like the last few have, which was fantastic! I only wish there could have been a little more freedom in the controls (jumping etc) and level design (it's a bit linear some times). But maybe I'm just dreaming of a sandbox-style Bond game with multiple paths to the same objective. A guy can dream...

The story was one of the strongest parts in my opinion, but it had it's flaws. I was surprised to find out that Bruce Feirstein (*Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough*) had written it, but then I went back and found out that he was actually a fairly consistent contributor to the Bond games, having done *Everything or Nothing*, *From Russia With Love* and *Goldeneye Reloaded*. Still, I like that a actual Bond writer had done it and it helped give the whole thing a more Bondian feel.

At first I could swear they were going to use Greco from the pre-titles sequence the villain throughout the entire game but I'm glad they didn't do that. It would have been pretty predictable. But the villain isn't exactly the game's strongest point anyway. There are a few twists and turns in the plot involving who the villain is. At first it's pays off with what I though was gonna be the ending; after killing Pomerov. It lead me to get a bit annoyed with the game for being ridiculously short only to have it keep going and leave me pleasantly satisfied with falling for the twist. Then it happens a second time with Rak but the payoff is no where near as gratifying. I think we all saw Nicole being a villain coming pretty early on. **Then** it turns out that Nicole isn't even the the one behind everything and it ends pretty suddenly after that. It's a cool cliffhanger but, considering that I think they scrapped the sequel to this game, I kind of wish we had found out who the mystery man was. Maybe he would have been a more compelling villain than the three we got. Here's hoping someone resolved that story arc in the future... though I doubt it.

Anyway, that what I though about it.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,GG,True,t3_1e6ona,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1e6ona/spoilers_anyone_wanna_discuss_blood_stone/,

It was because of this, my dad made me watch all the Sean Connery and Roger Moore Bond films as a kid, and I was hooked. For some reason I never saw The Living Daylights, until last week. I just always skipped it, because I was never a fan of Licence to Kill which I owned in a VHS box set. I actually thought Timothy Dalton wasn't a good Bond because of it. I finally got a copy of The Living Daylights and watched it. 
I was wrong, The Living Daylights, isn't just a great Bond, but its one of the greatest actions films of the 1980's. Its storyline is more then a Bond film, its a current events film of the 1980. With the beginning of the exiles of Soviets in the late 1980's and the weapon smuggling into Afghanistan by the west. Its storyline is the most real world James Bond film that has ever been written, minus the cello case down the ski hill.     
After viewing it, my opinion on Timothy Dalton has changed, and I feel bad for his Bond, because it is caught in between trying to be a realistic Bond and the goofy Bond that Moore had created. It seem to me, that its a transition story and development of the James Bond character start with a goofy for fun Bond, but become what James Bond should be in the 1980's. I'm going to re watch Licence to Kill, in the next couple of days and it will be interesting to see if my opinion will change on it.

So the era of Connery is over. Lazenby had problems negotiating for new contract and we're in a situation where a new Bond is needed. That new Bond is Roger Moore. In the end he will end up having the most Bond movies played by any actor. IMO This wasn't the best move cause I never liked Moore's 007 movies for Bond himself. Anyway, there is a chance you might actually like Moore as Bond so I'll stop there :).


[**Live And Let Die**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/)  is the 8th (official) 007 movie.  In this mission Bond has to stop a heroin magnate. But the mission is not that easy as the mission will eventually lead Bond to meet some serious opponents in the name of Baron Samedi and Kananga. Also in this movie Bond' love interest is the lovely Jane Seymour who plays the role of young gullible girl who can tell you your future with the help of tarot cards (or so she thinks). 

This is one of the few Moore 007 movies that I like cause it is nice to see Bond in a mission like this, and in a place like this. 

[**Live And Let Die**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(novel)) just like the other previous official Bond movies is based on a novel from Ian Fleming. [**Live And Let Die**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(film)) was the second novel about the agent 007 by Ian Fleming.


And now it's time for the part where I tell you the results for the previous Bond movie that you've rated.  (OHMSS)

Last year MGM celebrated the 50 year anniversary of 007 by releasing a special hour and a half documentary about the most famous spy of the world, 007. The name of the documentary is **""Everything or Nothing: The Untold story of 007""**.


Everything Or Nothing focuses on three men with a shared dream Bond producers Albert R. Broccoli, Harry Saltzman and author Ian Fleming. Its the thrilling and inspiring narrative behind the longest running film franchise in cinema history which began in 1962. With unprecedented access both to the key players involved and to Eon Productions extensive archive, this is the first time the inside story of the franchise has ever been told on screen in this way. Director Stevan Riley follows a story that begins with a ground-breaking spy thriller and continues six Bonds and five decades later. While Bond was saving the world from chaos and catastrophe on screen, this compelling documentary draws back the curtain to reveal the battles, threats and real stakes unfolding behind the camera.

There is a DVD available of the documentary on Amazon. The documentary is also available on Netflix, but I'm not American so I can not provide you a link for the documentary on Netflix.

If you've watched the documentary you can write your thoughts about it below. No need to rate the documentary cause this won't be part of the final list of Bond movies.

And don't forget to rate SkyFall and/or the unofficial movies in [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1hgrv3/bond_movies_of_the_week_unofficial_bond_movies/) thread.

1371515206.0,15,self.JamesBond,1gjx96,Bond Movie of the Week: Quantum of Solace (2008),SinatraFan77,27,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1gjx96/bond_movie_of_the_week_quantum_of_solace_2008/,"Hey guys, Dragonsky was otherwise preoccupied tonight and he asked me to make the BMoTW, and I will happily oblige. This week we have Quantum of Solace. 

Quantum of Solace is the second of Daniel Craig's foray into being the super spy we all know and love. Quantum of Solace story, in a nutshell and avoiding spoilers, consists of Bond's facing off against wealthy businessman Dominic Greene, members of the group called Quantum who were responsible for Vesper Lynd's death in Casino Royale. Bond believes that Greene is after the country of Bolivia's oil [though that is not correct, he is actually after the country's water supply so that he can sell it to the highest bidder, and is also attempting a coup in the country. HOW DEVIOUS!! ](/spoiler). Accompanying Bond is Camille Montes, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko. Montes family was killed by the Bolivian general working with Greene, and her and Bond's path coincide in how both are dedicated to their revenge.

Quantum of Solace is a unique Bond movie for many reasons. Notably, it is known for being exceptionally violent, and has a somewhat disturbing death scene [Agent Strawberry Fields' drowning and covering in oil, mirroring the most famous scene of Goldfinger and warning Bond off of Greene's tail. Though it is very much like the Goldfinger scene, it is a bit more intense, so viewer discretion may be advised if your young ones enjoy watching Mr. Bond](/spoiler). This movie was also written during the 2007-2008 Writers' Strike, and MANY find that the movie suffered because of this. Daniel Craig stated that he had to write some of his own lines. Finally, QoS also contains an unusual event in that is implied that Bond and Camille do not actually ever have sex, though they do share a kiss. 

All in all, Quantum of Solace is overall thought to be the stain of Craig's ongoing career as 007, with Casino Royale and Skyfall being some of the best of the best, and QoS lagging behind in certain areas. It does however, end Bond's torment over the death of Vesper and allow him to do his thing with a free mind, it has Bond leaving MI6 for a time, only to come back with the words ""I never left"", and constitutes a fine film to enjoy.

This week's BMOTW is **Casino Royale** the movie that is marked as 007 reboot starting Daniel Craig as Bond, but it's not the first try of ecranisation of the the first novel about 007 by Ian Fleming.

The 2 other ""Casino Royales"" are the one starting Barry Nelson as Bond from [1954](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310853/) and the second one is a 007 parody from [1967](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310853/) with couple of guys portraying the role of Bond (see the movie and you'll understand).

So after we've got that out of the way let's talk about the [2006](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/) version. This movie is the ""official"" adaptation of Ian Fleming's first book about 007 which is the reason we are right now right here talking about the suave agent with code name 007. After some problems with the studio MGM finally decided to make the 21st Bond movie adaptation of the book but they needed a Bond after Pierce Brosnan became too old (for someone) to play Bond. They needed a younger Bond and they needed a new Bond for the new generation.They needed someone that will help MGM to bring back Bond, and to did that with a bang. 

And so he did. He was 38 old English actor going by the name of Craig.Daniel Craig. This decision was really controversial and many fans thought that Craig doesn't fit the fit the mold that made Bond.That he might be good actor but he is not Bond. ""A blond haired Bond? Monstrosity !""  There was even a site CraigIsNotBond.com (I'm not really sure if that was the URL of the site) made by irritated Bond fans. 

After 7 years some of the fans learned to live with the fact that Craig is Bond and some even love him as a Bond. But however there are still some fans how don't like Craig as Bond.

The movie did it's job perfectly. It brought Bond back in the game in great fashion. Casino Royale was hit, most of the old fans liked the movie, and immediately after seeing the movie new fans were born. 

The movie as already mentioned stars Daniel Craig as Bond, Eva Green as the controversial Vesper Lynd, Judi Dench as M and for the first time a black guy portrayed Bond's american friend-Felix Leither. Jeffrey Wright was Leighter in this movie and IMO he did a solid job, and the fact that there weren't many unhappy fans about the fact that black guy played Leither proves it.

The villain in the movie is played by the *brilliant* Mads Mikkelsen who is one of the guys who in my opinion deserve more recognition. **Casino Royale** gave him that popularity, and rightfully so. Mads Mikkelsen (you can check NBC for his portrayal of the iconic Hannibal  btw)  was great as the rich and sinister Le Chiffre. 

The official James Bond 007 page decided to make a survey before *SkyFall* to let the fans determine the best Bond movie in their opinion and Casino Royale won. Do you share their opinion? Write your review about **Casino Royale** and your **rating for Die Another Day** bellow.

And now let's see how you've rated (one of ) my fave Bond movie *The World Is Not Enough*

You were cruel to ""my"" TWINE but things could've been worse for Brosnan's 3rd Bond movie as TWINE gets 5.6 same score as AVTAK and TND.

Besides giving your rating for *Die Another Day* don't forget to sum up your thoughts about Bond's rebirth in Casino Royale.

Reddit, I seem to have found myself in possession of an extra copy of Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond book, Casino Royale.

But, what's the catch? I thought I would have some fun with this and turn it into a contest. All you need to do is come up with a plot synopsis for the next movie. Keep in mind that it can be as outrageous or as canon faithful as you would like. Whichever one either gets the most upvotes or I like the best, will win the book. I will choose a winner on Saturday night and PM the winner the same night. I will also let everyone know which one I picked at that time.

The tournament will start this Wednesday, and you will vote for your fave theme song in the tournament.But remember the voting will start this Wednesday in a special thread for the tournament.

Moonraker is the eleventh movie about the secret agent James Bond. In this movie the role of Bond is played by Roger Moore just like the previous 2 movies.
In the movie James Bond has to make an investigation about a mid-air theft. By doing this he will discover a space shuttle plot. Of course Bond will try to stop this with the help of Dr. Goodhead. 

This movie just like the other 007 adventures is based on a novel by Ian Fleming. Many people prefer the book to the movie and think that the movie did injustice to the book. My recommendation for you is to read the  book and be the judge of that.

There are people who think that this is one of the worst movies of the franchise. Does that mean that DAF's last spot is in danger at our Bond movie table? We'll find out in 2 weeks.

And now it's time for my fave part of these threads (I hope yours too), to find out the ranking of the last movie you gave your ratings to.

Let's see how TMWTGG did.

6. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
7. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die

9. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

It would have also cleared up the awkwardness of switching between Connery and George Lazenby, and then back to Connery in *Diamonds Are Forever*.

On the other hand, let's suppose Lazenby had stayed on for *Diamonds*. He hadn't quit the series and Connery didn't get ""bribed"" back. Would he have been better suited to the lighter tone? If he had stayed on and gradually got more comfortable as Bond, which film (assuming the films stayed in the same order they are now) would have been his last? Would he have just done *Secret Service* and *Diamonds*, or would he have gone into Roger Moore's films?

I think *Diamonds* could've been a better movie for Lazenby. He looked like a Bond, moved like a Bond, but he couldn't pull off the dramatic scenes like a Bond, so maybe the comedy would have been easier for him since it has fewer romantic/dramatic scenes. I would think if Lazenby had stayed on and had been given more of a chance to improve as an actor, he would have done at least those two films, maybe one or two more, but that's being very generous.

Or let's suppose Lazenby did drop out after *Secret Service*, but Connery still wouldn't come back. As such, let's say Roger Moore came on one film earlier and did *Diamonds* instead? Would that have helped it come over better? I also think Moore would have pulled off that film much more comfortably than Connery, at least in my opinion. 

Connery's dry wit comes across awkwardly with the overt jokes in *Diamonds*, but Moore is better suited for comedic, light Bonds than Connery was, so perhaps it would have been a better introduction to his Bond.

These are my thoughts. What are yours? I know I just posted in this subreddit earlier, but I also had this idea as well and thought it would be another interesting discussion point. Discuss!

1354064562.0,17,self.JamesBond,13wmwn,The Correct Order of Bond Movies? SPOILERS INSIDE,dcass,20,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/13wmwn/the_correct_order_of_bond_movies_spoilers_inside/,"OK, after watching Skyfall and the big reveals at the end,  it made me think how to order the Bond movies so they made sense with the characters, continuity and the AGE of Bond.  Of course, to make this work we have to ignore what era it is (i.e. it being the 60s, 70s, 80s, etc...)

To do so (unfortunately) we have to throw out ""Thunderball"", ""You Only Live Twice"", and ALL the Brosnan Bonds . On top of THAT we have to add in Never Say Never again.  (I explain why below)

Here is my order:

**ERA 1**: (Young Bond)

1   Casino Royale (2006-Daniel Craig)

2   Quantum of Solace (2008-Daniel Craig)

3   Skyfall (2012-Daniel Craig)


**ERA 2**: (Still Youngish Bond)

4   The Living Daylights (1987-Timothy Dalton) 

5   Licence to Kill (1989-Timothy Dalton)

6   Dr. No (1962-Sean Connery)

7   From Russia With Love (1963-Sean Connery)

8   Goldfinger (1964-Sean Connery)

9   Live and Let Die (1973-Roger Moore)

10  The Man with the Golden Gun (1974-Roger Moore)

11  The Spy Who Loved Me (1977-Roger Moore)

12  Moonraker (1979-Roger Moore)

**ERA 3**: (The Blofeld / Mrs. Bond Trilogy)

13  On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969-George Lazenby)

14  Diamonds Are Forever (1971-Sean Connery)

15  For Your Eyes Only (1981-Roger Moore)

**ERA 4**: (The Aging Bond)   

16  Octopussy (1983-Roger Moore)

17  A View to a Kill (1985-Roger Moore)

18  Never Say Never Again (1983 - Sean Connery)




Here is my reasoning… hear me out:  

**ERA 1** So the FIRST era is obvious.  The Craig's are the introduction of Bond LEADING UP to the formula of bond (male - bureaucrat M, Q, Moneypenny as secretary, office with coat rack, etc...)

-

**ERA 2**  Requirements are: 

* Male M
* a Quartermaster (Q)
* Moneypenny
* Bond is still youngish. 

Because of these requirements, all of the Bronsan's HAVE to be left out (which kills me because Goldeneye is a real favorite).  in the Brosnan ones, M is Dench, so they *could* be BEFORE Skyfall, but there is a Q and Moneypenny so it wouldn't make sense character continuity-wise. For this era, Bond is basically out there doing missions, saving the world, bagging chicks.

-

**ERA 3**  All about Blofeld and Mrs. Bond getting Killed.  Bond is mature, has bagged countless hotties and has his heart stolen for the first time since Vesper.  He gets Married.  Now, because its the Blofeld Trilogy we sadly HAVE to leave out ""You Only Live Twice"". He can't meet Blofeld twice, and because ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" has the marriage which is VERY important to continuity it gets the nod.  ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" caps it off when he visits his wife's grave and finally kills Blofeld.

-

**ERA 4** Bond is getting older and doing old guy missions.  More suave and funny than action guy, but still has a decent judo kick.  Logically, we pick up again at ""Moonraker"" for the Jaws continuity.  


It all ENDS with ""Never Say Never Again"" - which we all know is from the same source material as Thunderball.  In this story Flemming INTENDED it to be an older Bond who is losing a step, so it makes sense to have it be an old Connery finishing up the series.  All neat and tidy with Connery Bookends.


What do you think?

Please discuss, this could be fun.

After Sean Connery received glaringly positive reviews last week (as was expected), we move to a Bond that is much less well known, respected, and loved by the Bond audience at large. 

George Robert Lazenby was born on September 5, 1939, Goulburn, New South Wales. His sister Barbara was an accomplished dancer even during their high school days. He served in the Australian army before moving to London in 1963, where he became a well known commercial and spokesman, including a [well known Big Fry Chocolate commercial that helped land him his role in OHMSS] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQxcoGOhnts). After meeting Lazenby while getting a haircut at the same barber, Albert Broccoli saw the commercial and thought Lazenby would be an excellent replacement to the on-his-way-out-the-door Sean Connery. On being called to the audition, Lazenby sported a Rolex watch and a suit that was ordered but unclaimed by Connery, and made a complete Bond package to those that saw him. Upon his accidentally punching a wrestler/stuntman in the nose, the suave and aggressive was thought to have met perfectly in the package of George Lazenby by those who oversaw his casting. Lazenby landed the role On Her Majesty's Secret Service was released on December, 18 1969.

The November before the film was released, George Lazenby stated that he would not be returning to the role of James Bond, stating that the film producers would not take any input from him, and that he no longer enjoyed the role as he felt it was no ""based in reality"". His co-star in OHMSS, Diana Rigg, stated that she thought it was a foolish move for him to make, judging by the success and fortune it gave to Sean Connery. OHMSS received generally positive reviews, Lazenby's performance a bit less so, with different reviews stating that his dress choices were poor (who can forget the kilt), and more of a brutish figure rather than a suave agent. 

Personally, to be a successor to Sean Connery was a feat that in all probability would have been impossible to perfect, as undoubtedly the only people wanted to replace Connery was Connery. George Lazenby did the best with the hand that was dealt to him and, while having several shortcomings, was a fairly good Bond. 

Please, discuss and debate the pros and cons of Mr. Lazenby's performance, and watch out for Roger Moore's debut in seven days! Have a good one guys! ",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,,True,t3_1jb0pq,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1jb0pq/bond_of_the_week_george_lazenby/,moderator

Anyone game?,DoctorSteve,16,1,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/18f1li/i_love_casino_royale_but_no_one_seems_to_want_to/,"I love Casino Royale. I think it's easily the best Craig Bond film, one of the best Bond films ever, and one of my favourite films in general. It's got everything you want, and the cast is terrific. The plot, however, is interesting.

So the first watch through, my thoughts go like this: Vesper slowls falls for Bond, Mathis betrays Bond and Vesper, Vesper makes a deal while being tortured in exchange for Bond's life, they are freed, Vesper falls for Bond, they escape, Vesper sees her contacts and has to make good on the deal. But further watchings make it seems more than that.

Vesper's sudden affection for Bond, is that mostly an act? She clearly likes him somewhat, but it would seem that she is acting most of it. It is interesting how (in the scene with Bond in a chair) she is sexually aggressive on him, but after some honest words from Bond she is moved and cries a bit. As in, that's the honest side of her.

It would mean that she is pursuing Bond to get access to the money to transfer it to Quantum. Which makes sense... right? Or does it?

Because: She is putting in the routing number for the funds. Bond puts in the password he picked, but it does not seem Vesper has to put in the routing number for the MI6 account. So what is all that for? Why couldn't she just have put in the Quantum tracking number and left?

Which makes it more confusing. If Vesper is a double agent the whole time, why is LeChiffre there? Is Vesper working higher up the ladder than LeChiffre? Why would they care who wins if it is down to Bond and LeChiffre? Vesper would just transfer over the money.

Which is FURTHER confusing because why wouldn't Vesper restake Bond? It would seem that would be the best way to ensure one of the two wins.

============
============
But let's assume Vesper has to put it into an account made for the tournament, and they are to transfer it from that account to MI6. And that she has to win over Bond, keep him from returning to transfer the money, get to a drop off city, then make the drop off. That whole sideplot should check out, minus why Quantum wasn't leveraging Vesper the whole time. Let's move on to a nice wrinkle added by QoS: How is Mathis NOT a double agent?

Seriously, the entire structure of Casino Royale is ruined if Mathis is not a double agent. There's no way Vesper was in on this all herself. It would add all of the problems listed above, plus the whole problem of why LeChiffre mentions Mathis by name. (Personally I would have made Mathis the villain of the third film, as I thought it was terrible to bring him back, then even worse to kill him off instantly. I loved his sidekick character and thought he'd have been a great addition to the franchise as it was going. They basically had a Mathis in Skyfall anyway. Grrr Skyfall.)


Casino Royale's plot just needs a little tightening I think. Vesper having a previous connection to Quantum isn't as good as Vesper making a deal with them as it happens. And I don't know what Mr. White meant to LeChiffre saying ""know who to trust"". It comes off a little as ""We don't have a plot in mind but this is vauge but sounds meaningful.""

Still love the film. Wish the rest of the series had followed in its footsteps with a strong female lead with dynamite chemistry with Craig and lots of Bond in civilian locations being suave. But I'll always have it, and I'm very grateful for that.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,,True,t3_18f1li,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/18f1li/i_love_casino_royale_but_no_one_seems_to_want_to/,

The song has really grown on me, and reminds me a lot of Shirley Bassey - the Queen of Bond songs.  That said, I didn't think that the actual credits sequence was very memorable.  It was just a lot of stuff that shows up later in the movie.  But the movie itself made up for the lackluster credits.  It's in the top 3 or 4 for me.

Anyway, here are my top 5 opening credits:

5.  A View to a Kill.  I love ski sequences (IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, EON PRODUCTIONS!  WE NEED ANOTHER ONE!).  I love duran duran.  And the glow in the dark paint is cool.
4.  The Spy who Loved Me.  Best use of a trampoline in opening credits.  Come on...Roger Moore bouncing around + that awesome theme song = one of the best credits sequences
3.  Casino Royale.  I'm a sucker for that Mad Men-esque type 60's art style.  And it's a pretty high intensity opening that gets me in the spirit for some good action sequences.
2.  Goldeneye.  Great song, and I liked the women hammering away at the Lenin statues.  Also the woman with two heads who shoots a gun out of her mouth.
1.  From Russia with Love...gotta love it.  Best use of the female form.  [Ted Moore must have abused his power as Director of Photography when it came to placing his name, if you know what I mean.](http://youtu.be/aOw2hTBHMvA?t=1m6s)

Honorable mention:  Live and Let Die.  The women turning into skulls always freaked me out as a kid.  The sequence itself isn't too exciting, although the song is one of the best.

So what are your favorites?  And here's to another 50 years of opening credits that people actually pay attention to!

I hope this post is okay and doesn't violate any rules! If it is not okay, just let me know so a mod can delete it!

Back in 2005 they announced Casino Royale was going to be Bond 21. At this point we didn't know what the film would bring. Craig had yet to be announced as Bond. With the memory of Die Another Day still fresh, I feared that the producers would not do Fleming's first novel justice.

At the same time I had recently just become interested in old time radio/audio dramas. I decided that if the producers weren't going to give Casino Royale a faithful adapation, I would. (Of course, they ended up doing a fantastic job). So I decided to make an audio drama that was a straight adaptation of the novel. 

I was in a bit over my head, I had no clue how to go about casting and making it happen, so it took a long time. By the time we finally got everything set, written, music recorded, a theme song produced and got to recording lines... the film had already been released. The show ended up being released over the course of a year from 2007-2008.

I just thought I would post it here and seeing what you thought of it. I was thinking about working on and releasing another one...the people over at the [Bond and Beyond forums](http://www.bondandbeyond.forumotion.com) have offered to support, assist, and host a new audio drama... so I'm considering it. It's nice to know I have people willing to help me out. But, more importantly, I want to see if people thought it was decent enough that they'd be willing to listen to another before I go through all that effort.

Hope you enjoy!

We get one of the weirder Bond movies (IMO) in the name of Octopussy. But that shouldn't be big surprise cause once you see that Moore is starring the movie as a Bond you know you are going to see some silliness. And sometimes that is good. Was it good that time? You decide.

This movie is released as the 13th ""Official"" Bond movie, and it is Moore's 6th movie as a Bond. This is the 2nd to last Moore Bond movie which means that we are soon going to finish the Moore era in our BMOTW series.

Like I said [**Octopussy**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086034/) is a silly movie in my opinion. I think that you can judge that by [this](http://www.top10films.co.uk/img/Octopussy_James-Bond_Roger-Moore_Clown.jpg) shot from the movie. But again don't let my comments ruin the movie for you. Like I said it doesn't mean that silly can't be good. For example I kind of liked the clown scene which gets some hate from some of the Bond fans.

In this mission Bond has to make an investigation about a fake Fabergé egg which lead a fellow Double-Oh agent to his death. Will Mr.Bond get the same result as his ""co-worker"" ? Watch this movie and find out. 

Much like the previous movies, [**Octopussy**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopussy) is based on a novel from Ian Fleming.Much like the previous movie, **Octopussy** is based on a novel with short stories about Bond. The name of the novel is [""Octopussy and The Living Daylights""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopussy_and_The_Living_Daylights) and if you are fan of short stores and Bond I encourage you to read the book. Besides Octopussy and The Living Daylights the novel also has 2 more short stories: ""The property of a lady"" and ""007 in Newyork"".


And now for something completely different. Our Bond movie table is shaping up nicely. Will Moonraker do some shake ups on our table? Let's find out:

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
4. | 8.2 | Dr.No
5. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
6. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
7. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
8. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
9. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
10. |5.1 |MoonRaker
11. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever


So with a score of 5.1 Moonraker is our second to last movie. Which brings up the question : Will someone take over DAF's last spot? I guess we will find out in the next few weeks.

What do you think about the table? Tell us below.

Since introducing himself to the world at the exclusive gambling club in London over fifty years ago in Dr. No, Bond, James Bond has become one the longest running film series in the history of cinema. The franchise has been very successful with 24 Eon Production films spanning six decades and 12 Ian Fleming books published several times over since their original debut at the height of the Cold War.

Last week our Bond Of The Week was George Lazenby who ""thanks"" to his agent and his own will of having a personal life without MGM controlling his every move we are having a new Bond after only one movie. 

So after Lazenby's only Bond movie this week's Bond of the week will be the actor who played Bond after Lazenby right ? Wrong. After Lazenby MGM decided to play it safe and recast Sean Conerry as Bond in ""Diamonds Are Forever ^Forever ^^Forever ^^^Forever"". But Sean Conerry is a normal human being (?) who as every human being ages (?). It was obvious in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" that Connery can't be Bond forever ^forever ^^forever so MGM had to cast a new Bond. A Bond of new generation, a Bond that should get Bond back to the track. In the end the Bond that was Connery successor was the person that portrayed Bond record seven times.  Mr. Roger Moore.

Sir Roger Moore is an English actor who achieved worldwide popularity during his times as Bond. Moore was born on 14 October 1927 in Stockwell as the only child of George Alfred Moore, a policeman, and Lillian ""Lily"" a housewife. Moore attended Battersea Grammar School, but was evacuated to Holsworthy, Devon, during World War II. He was then educated at Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. He then attended the College of the Venerable Bede at the University of Durham, but did not graduate. Later he was commissioned into the Royal Army where later became a captain.
Immediately prior to his national service, he did a brief stint at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, during which his fees were paid by film director Brian Desmond Hurst, who also used Moore as an extra in his film Trottie True. At RADA, Moore was a classmate of his future Bond costar Lois Maxwell, the original Miss Moneypenny. Moore first appeared in films during the mid-to-late 1940s as an extra. Moore's film idol as a child was Stewart Granger. At the age of 17, Moore appeared as an extra in the film Caesar and Cleopatra (1945), finally meeting his idol on the set. Moore later worked with Granger in The Wild Geese.

Moore's first Bond film was ""Live And Let Die"" (1973), but that wasn't Moore's first role as an action hero. Before he was Bond, Mr. Moore was Simon Templar, a modern Robin Hood kind of hero in the British TV Series [""The Saint""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055701/). Moore spent 7 years as Simon Templar in the original TV series ""The Saint"". (1962-1969)

Roger Moore was actually one of the first actors to be considered for the role of 007 but he had to turn the offer down because he was contracted for ""The Saint"".

In [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro7vdOMmMSs) rare video you can see Moore in the role of Bond. This was a video sketch in which Roger Moore was portraying Bond before he was actually chosen to be ""the actual"" James Bond.

After the 7 Bond movies Roger Moore never reached the popularity he once had, but still he is famous for his charity work and his portrayal of the iconic spy 007. 

Roger Moore just like Sean Connery was knighted and now he can proudly say that he is SIR Roger Moore.

Sir Roger wrote a book reflecting his years as Bond, the other actors' portrayal of 007 and Bond in general. You can order his ""Bond on Bond"" book [here](http://www.amazon.com/Bond-On-Reflections-years-Movies/dp/0762782811/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375719765&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Moore%3A+Bond+on+Bond).

That's all for this week's thread of Bond Of The Week serial. In the comment section bellow share your opinion on Roger Moore as an actor, as person and most importantly as a Bond.

Next week's Bond Of The Week will be one of the most brutal Bonds.Until then stay safe and Bond on.

The reason why I call this movie controversial is because many people consider this to be the worst Bond movie of all time, and it was movie that should be mix of the old and the new cause Bond was celebrating a anniversary in the year when **Die Another Day** was released.

Altough after the first viewing I kind of hated this movie,I have to admit that this movie becomes better after multiple viewings.So if you haven't given this movie a chance, it wouldn't be bad to put on DVD in your player and decide to give **Die Another Day** another chance.

**Die Another Day** is the 20th Bond movie in the MGM franchise and its main plot resolves around Mr.Bond investigating the connection between a North Korean terrorist and a diamond mogul who is funding the development of an international space weapon. During his investigation he gets (sort of) help from the first black Bond girl in the series- Halle Berry who portrays the role of Jinx. The other protagonists in **Die Another Day** feature Rosamund Pike,Toby Stephens,Rick Yune... 

Damme Judi Dench portarys Bond's boss M once again while the Quartermaster in this movie is portrayed by the actor who got his debut in *The World Is Not Enough*, the comedy genius John Cleese. If I try to talk about this movie I will spoil most of the things, so without implying that the movie is good or bad I would like you to watch the movie on your own and give this movie a review on your own.

Another thing that you should do in this thread (besides giving your review about **Die Another Day** ) is to give *The World Is Not Enough* a rating, just like you did for *Tomorrow Never Dies* which placed the 2nd Bond movie with Brosnan as 007 on ......

I have a confession: I have never seen a Bond movie before. This is obviously an issue that needs to be remedied. However, I was wondering if you would recommend watching them in any particular order. 

Also, I'm sure you all have your own personal favorite movies; any you would remend in particular, or that I should avoid?

I didn't see any FAQ and I did search to see if anything had been posted, but nothing came up, and Google gave no consensus. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

After establishing himself as the English spy that everyone loves Sean Connery continues his journey as Bond which will lead him to the lovely Pussy.Pussy Galore and the mean baddy Auric Goldfinger as well as the villainous and unforgettable Oddjob.

By many people this movie is one of the best if not the best Bond movie of all time. It has everything that made Bond famous: gadgets, cars, girls, action....

[**Goldfinger**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_(novel)) was yet another novel by Ian Fleming about the agent that everybody loves. This novel later became a very successful movie with the same name-  [**Goldfinger**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/). 

I can say many things about Goldfinger, about the stunning girl in golden paint and about the amazing lines that this movie has, lines that will be remembered as one of the best lines in movie history.

No you are not dreaming, **Goldfinger** is our *Bond Movie Of The Week*


But don't start typing your review so fast. I don't expect you to do that. I expect you to rate *From Russia With Love* first.

The rating that *Dr.No* got was 8.2

First of all I think that we should start with the movies.That will be a thread that will be opened on Sunday and it will feature a thread where you can share your reviews and opinions on the Bond movie of the week.

After some time we can continue to 2 threads a week.One about the Bond movie of the week (in the rest of the thread it will be named as BMOTW) and one thread where we can review Bond characters. 

Furthermore if there is interest we can make reviews for gadgets,books,Bond memorabilia etc.

First I want to hear your ideas about the schedule of Bond movies.

What movie should be first,second etc.

I kinda want it to be all mashed up (Craig movie,Moore movie,Connery movie..) but if you want it to go chronologically it will be done so :).

As a result I've also found that I'd be willing to watch some movies more often than others.

Which movie(s) in the series have you all watched most often, or to word it differently, which movie(s) would you be most likely to pop in if you wanted to have a Bond Movie Night? These don't necessarily have to be the ones you consider the best, just the ones you enjoy the most and would want to watch if you had your druthers.

What are your thoughts?

Here are my picks for each actor:

* **Connery:** *You Only Live Twice*. Most people would probably say *Goldfinger* or *From Russia With Love*, and while I love those entries, *You Only Live Twice* just hits the marks for me in a more fun way. I love the Japanese setting, the Little Nellie sequence is one of my favorites, we finally see Blofeld, and the volcano infiltration battle is fantastic.

* **Lazenby:** *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*. Yes, it's the only one he did, and yes, it's not perfect, but I find it still fairly enjoyable. I don't hate Lazenby so much as I just wish his voice sounded different. It's a very minor thing, but the only thing keeping me from really liking him is something about the way he delivers his lines, I don't know what.

* **Moore:** This one's tough. I love Roger Moore as Bond and I would happily watch any of his entries if asked (save *A View To A Kill* unless there was alcohol involved), but I think it'd have to go to... either *The Spy Who Loved Me* or *The Man With the Golden Gun*. I'll need to watch those two again and make a final verdict. (Maybe slight edge to *Golden Gun*?)

* **Dalton:** My preferred Timothy Dalton entry is *The Living Daylights*. It was a welcome change after dear old Roger left. Action galore, Bond taking himself seriously again, Dalton's dry-as-a-bone humor and general intensity are magnetic, a realistic (enough for the series, at least) plot, and the music is some of the best I've heard from the series. I was actually completely engaged in what was happening, which was a pleasant surprise.

* **Brosnan:** Although I consider *GoldenEye* the best of Brosnan's run, I would pop in *Tomorrow Never Dies* any day. It's entertaining, Jonathan Pryce is terrific, Michelle Yeoh and Brosnan work very well together, love the music again, and again, I love the Asian setting.

* **Craig:** It's been the longest time since I've seen his films, so I'll just go off of memory. *Skyfall* currently tops his run, but I'd need to see *Casino Royale* again before I can properly judge.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,UK,True,t3_19ycvo,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/19ycvo/mostviewed_movies/,

That's right Sean Connery is back as Bond ! Slightly older than the last official Bond movie we've seen him in Mr.Connery is coming back with a bang ? 

Well not quite judging by some of the fans. By me personally **Diamonds Are Forever** is a fun movie. This week we'll see if you agree with me about the Bond movie that is based on [4th novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_(novel) from Ian Fleming about the agent James Bond.

In this mission our favorite agent is on a diamond smuggling mission which eventually will lead him to his old nemesis-Ernest Stavro Blofeld.  In his quest he meets Mr. Kidd and Wint one of the less memorable Bond villains, but in Vegas he also meets Plenty.Plenty O'Toole who is quite rememberable.

Overall this is a fun movie which is good transitional movie to the next Bond-Mr.Moore and a last hoorah for Sean Connery as a Bond. What was Mr. Connery doing while he wasn't being Bond and skiing at Piz Gloria you may ask? The answer is simple: He was Bond. So if then you thought that Connery will never come back as Bond he thought us to *Never Say Never..Again*.

So /r/JamesBond what do you have to say about** Diamonds Are Forever** ? 

(In the comments leave your rating for *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* and that movie only )

So now is time for my favorite part of these threads. The result from the last thread.

In the last thread you voted for You Only Live Twice, and your results were good enough to place YOLT at number..

2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | Dr.No
4. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
5. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice

Five ! So far your votes put You Only Live Twice at the last spot. Will things change? We'll see in the next thread after your votes for OHMSS will be calculate.

Until then... Stay safe and Bond on.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,GG,True,t3_19n9ud,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/19n9ud/bond_movie_of_the_weekdiamonds_are_forever/,moderator

А new era begins.Era of [George Lazenby](http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSYxBjOxOCFYV2RdFCyiHXQVcODsYQYfKVBkpscS1aEyx4WBqqPsg), an era that will be whole 1 Bond movie long. And boy was that movie great. 

This movie much like the previous is based of Ian Fleming's novel with the same name [""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Her_Majesty's_Secret_Service_(novel) In this movie we are learning about Bond's past (including the motto that will later be a name of a Bond movie) and about Bond's future.If I start giving synopsis for this movie I might give you a spoiler and trust me if you haven't seen this movie you really don't want to be spoiled. 

So all I'm going to tell you is that [**On Her Majesty's Secret Service**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064757/) has action,dialogs,plot to take over the world,a classic villain played by classic actor,it has exotic location, and many Bond girls. So don't wait and start watching the movie now (for first or any other time) cause you don't have the whole time in the world.

So now it's time for the moment that you were (hopefully) waiting. The results of the last week.

1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger

So Thunderball so far is at the bottom at the list. Will that change after this week?

Don't forget to leave your rating for You Only Live Twice (and that movie only) in the comment section bellow :)

Bond on.



(edit: you can discuss Lazenby as Bond too, would you liked to see him as a Bond more or you think he shouldn't have been Bond at all. I wanted to write few lines about him but I forgot. The word is that he thought that it was too hard to be Bond that he didn't wanted to live like Bond outside of the movie,something that they wanted him to be. They offered him huge contract but his agents ""screwed"" him by telling him to reject or something like that.)",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,1361839404.0,,GG,True,t3_198603,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/198603/bond_movie_of_the_weekon_her_majestys_secret/,moderator

The Billion dollar Bond got 5 oscar nominations today as an addition to the billion dollars that SkyFall got in the box office internationally.

This makes 2012 without a doubt the Bond year. There were many events around the world to celebrate the 50 years of Bond.

This subreddit grew a lot since the beginning of last year. This subreddit is now ~3.000 MI6 Agent strong.

So cause this subreddit is getting bigger every year and since there were not many events on /r/JamesBond to celebrate the 50 years of Bond I got an idea.

Why we all don't share our opinions of Bond. Movies,books,characters,gadgets....

Since the BOND50 BluRay went out Bond got many new fans,who I assume , immediately watched the old Bond movies to satisfy their need for Bond.

Also there are many fans of Agent 007 who are fans since the early days of Bond (I hope that we have some people on this subreddit who watched some of the premieres of the Bond movies before Brosnan).Those are fans who probably have read the novels and spent their cash on Bond collectibles.

So to live up this place I'm asking you: **Do you want weekly/monthly/daily Bond reviews on /r/JamesBond ?**

We will start with the movies and then we will continue with your reviews of the actors who played Bond,Bond girls,gadgets,cars,villains,Bond novels,authors of the novels,Bond collectibles and stuff.

If you are up for this I'm going to make some schedule of the movie reviews (e.g. Next Friday we review SkyFall,The week after that Dr.No etc.) and if that gets good reaction we will continue by doing other interactive threads like :How you were introduced to the world of Bond,What Bond items do you have etc.

So /r/JamesBond do you like the idea?

What is a trope?  Wikipedia says ""a commonly recurring literary device or motif, a cliché.""  Basically a Bond trope is something - a character, a plot device, an idea - that reoccurs in multiple Bond films, in a slightly different form each time.  The most obvious and classic ones are the ""Bond villain"" and ""Bond girl"" tropes that are essential to every 007 film.  But there are some others that are less frequent that I really enjoy.  In particular I've been wondering what tropes will be brought back in future Craig films.  Some examples:

- Skyfall brought back one of the classics, the villain's hidden island lair that Bond must infiltrate.  This one was established right from the beginning in Dr. No and has been featured in The Man with the Golden Gun, You Only Live Twice, and many others.  In OHMSS it was a mountain lair.  In the Spy Who Loved me it was a lair that could move.  You get the idea.

- The slient, deadly henchman that Bond must defeat with his wits because he is too strong to simply punch out.  This really took shape with Jaws, but Oddjob is a protoype for this one.  There is also a massive Indian gentlemen in Octopussy who serves this purpose.  I would love to see a Craig film's take on this.

- The ally who is technically on the wrong side of the law, but fights alongside Bond anyway due to circumstances.  Examples include Marc Ange Draco from OHMSS, Colombo from FYEO, and the Taliban from The Living Daylights.  Again, something like this would be just awesome in a Craig film but we haven't really seen it yet (allied agents like Mathis don't count, though that is its own trope).

- Tall blond badass Russian henchman, speaks rarely but not totally silent like Jaws or Oddjob.  The original here is Red Grant, and examples can be found in For Your Eyes Only, The Living Daylights, and Tomorrow Never Dies (where he is German).

- Another trope is a small machine or invention that can change the world if it falls into the right or wrong hands.  The Lektor decoder from FRWL is the original, other examples are the Solex Agitator from TMWTGG and whatever the ATAC or something from FYEO (""that's detente.  You don't have it, and I don't have it."")

So can you think of any other tropes that have come up over the years?  And more specifically which would you like to see ressurected in a Craig film?",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,,True,t3_1dg4o5,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1dg4o5/tropes_of_bond/,

Sorry for the late opening of this thread but I didn't had much time today.

But better late than never.

This post won't be really good cause I'm sleepy and I want to go to bed so I'll just post the usual Bond stuff about this movie :).

So **You Only Live Twice** (that's the motto) is the 5th (and last?) Bond movie starring Sean Connery as Bond.James Bond. Out of the 5 (at that point) MGM Bond movies this was the worst by some people.

To be honest I fell asleep when I first watched** You Only Live Twice** but not cause I was bored by the movie but cause I was really really sleepy (I haven't sleep for almost 2 days then IIRC) so that shouldn't stop you from watching this weeks Bond Movie Of The Week (in case you haven't yet).


[**You Only Live Twice**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcIl_6amBvU) has great theme song sung by the great Nancy Sinatra. 

This movie is also based on a novel by Ian Fleming with the same name: [You Only Live Twice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Only_Live_Twice_(novel)).

I feel like I can write much much more about this movie but as I already mentioned I'm really sleepy.

So without further ado I present you this weeks Bond Movie Of The Week:

[**You Only Live Twice**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/)

But now it's time to move on with the second movie about the British agent.

[**From Russia With Love**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057076/)

**From Russia With Love** is a 1963 movie that by many is one of the better Bond movies of all time. The times has changed but this movie remained at the top.

**From Russia With Love** is a movie based on the [Fleming's novel with the same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Russia,_with_Love_(novel)) 

In this double-oh adventure Bond meets new friends and enemies such as the iconic Rosa Klebb, Red Grant, Tanya Romanova and Ali Karim Bey. 

If you thought that Bond's first filmed visit in Istanbul was in the pre title sequence in *SkyFall* you're wrong cause Bond first filmed visit of this lovely city actually happens in this movie.

So can it get any better than Bond pursuing SPECTRE agents? 

You decide cause **From Russia With Love** is our

**BOND MOVIE OF THE WEEK**



P.S. If  you wall saw *Dr.No* last week I would ask you to put your rating of * Dr.No* in a comment in this thread (from 0 to 10) so at the end of all BMOTW editions we can find the best Bond movie in your opinion.

Cheers :)

I personally think he is a fantastic actor having seen him on The Wire and Luther.  He could really pull off some of the more conflicted aspects of Bond that everybody loves in Craig.  The Stringer Bell character is a stone-cold killer with class, and Luther is an intense lawman with deep-seated issues.  That's exactly what Bond is supposed to be.  One issue is that Elba is already 40, so unless he got to the role within six years or so he'd be verging on too old (then again Moore started at age 45 and didn't quit til he was 53 or so, and Elba looks damn young for 40).

Either way, it's 2012 and race should not be an issue.  Not even in terms of continuity - Bond's physical appearance has been redefined so many times (most recently as a 5'10"" blond man with deep blue eyes) that there's no point trying to exclude a certain actor based on what they look like, so long as that actor is a middle-aged British man.

Since it looks like the Clive Owen ship has sailed, I'm pulling for Idris to wear the tux next.  What do you think?",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,,True,t3_161t6v,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/161t6v/lets_talk_about_idris_elba/,

My theory is that they are trying to show how at this point in the movie 007 did not care as much about his appearances as he did in Casino Royale, when he was still a new agent. Also the fact they are both casino/poker scenes makes me think that this connection is somewhat valid.

They're holding a Q&amp;A after the film and I need to bring along some questions. 

I have already devised two questions: 
&gt;*What are the advantages of using digital effects over practical effects? And what situations best serve these functions respectively?*


But I believe them to be very basic. However, I can ask your questions for you and give you results in two days time. 

So Reddit, please help me?

Thank you to the users that are more qualified to ask questions:

* **AUV**:
At what point does a stunt cost so much that it just becomes cheaper to do it digitally?

  How many ""dry"" practice runs does a stunt generally go through before the cameras roll?

  What's the difference between a stunt the actor can do and one they can't, and who makes the FINAL final decision on whether something is too dangerous?

* **handsomebob29**:
With the success of visual effects in recent films such as The Dark Knight, Skyfall and Prometheus, is the film industry slowly returning to the world of visual effects over special effects?

  Movies from the 90s and early 2000s are very dated with their early CGI but some restorations of films such as Back to the Future, Star Trek, and Indiana Jones who were famous for visual effects look better over time. Does Hollywood see a correlation or are is visual effects going to stay a minority?

* **Pypers**: 
Do you think the recent changes in technology over the years has made it easier for teams to provide more professional style effects or do you think it has watered down the art of post-production?

But when the time comes for him to hang up the Walther PPK and someone new steps in, are they going to play it like the transitions between actors in the original series? It's unlikely that we're going to see another total reboot so soon.

Fell free to downvote me if you don't feel like this belongs here.

So, this was my original post:

&gt; 1. An opening bank is announced. Each player decides whether they want to accept it. If no one accepts it, everyone chips in. 

&gt; 2. Both the Player and the Banker get two cards, face down.

&gt; 3. The Player looks at his cards without revealing them. If he gets an eight or nine, they're a natural, and he turns them up and wins, unless the Banker has an equal or better natural. 

&gt; 4. The Player decides whether to stand or draw another card, face up. 

&gt; 5. The Banker looks at his cards without revealing them. If he gets an eight or nine, they're a natural, and he turns them up and wins. 

&gt; 6. The Banker decides whether to stand or draw another card, face up. 

&gt; 7. Whoever has closer to nine wins. 


&gt; Strategies:

&gt; If the Player's or Banker's cards equal six or seven, he should stand. If they equal five, it's his choice. If he gets lower then five, he should draw another card, face up. It's his choice, no matter what - these are strategies. 

&gt; The Banker has a slight advantage in going second. If the Player stood, he would assume that the Player has a five, six, or seven. If he drew, the Banker knows that the Player probably has less than six, and can see the value of the Player's third card. 

I guess this is confusing, so I'll walk you through it. 

Say you're the banker. You would deal four cards from the [shoe](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRhfC_Oi-7xSTWNovSxzXg8Naa7TQ80f0EJiCSpswRhtQJR_nhY), two to the player and two to yourself. The player goes first. There are three ways to end the game: player wins, banker wins, or tie. There are several different scenarios possible:

1. **The player has a natural.**  
If the player has an eight or nine (a ""natural""), he turns them up. The banker also turns his up. If the banker has a greater natural (only possible if the player has an eight), the banker wins. If the banker has an equal natural, it's a tie. If the banker has a lesser natural, he loses.

2. **The player does not have a natural**  
If the player has a number lower than eight, he either draws or stands. He draws FACE UP. Drawing is recommended if his cards are lower than five, and not recommended if his cards are above five. If you draw on five, there is an equal chance of bettering or worsening your hand. If he draws and it equals an eight or nine, refer to step one. Otherwise, it's the banker's turn.

3. **The banker has a natural**  
If the player has a natural, he turns them up. The player also turns his up. If the player has a greater natural, the player wins. If the banker has an equal natural, it's a tie. If the player has a lesser natural, he loses.

4. **The banker does not have a natural**  
If the banker has a number lower than eight, he either draws or stands. He draws FACE UP. Drawing is recommended if his cards are lower than five, and not recommended if his cards are above five. If you draw on five, there is an equal chance of bettering or worsening your hand. If he draws and it equals an eight or nine, refer to step three. Otherwise, move on.

**The End**  
One all that is done, both the player and the banker turn up their cards. Whoever is closer to nine wins. If they are tied, it's a tie.

**Card Value Key**  
A = 1  
2 - 9 = face value  
10 - K = 0

If a score is above nine, only use the second number. Just take ten off the score.


Okay then, hope this helps! Feel free to ask questions and suggest stuff.

So all it took was me to make her a cup of coffee because she was too lazy to get off her ass and make it herself. Ever since she bought it for me she has made plans to have a Bond Marathon (as long as she likes it) with me on her days off work.

Well last night we watched Dr. No, which is one of the 6 bond movies I haven't seen yet (~~From Russia With Love~~, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, You Only Live Twice, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall). Dr. No did not do it for either of us and you could see that it was the first and probably the worst I have seen, too long and drawn out and useless dead space which could have been utilized with Bond action, wit, or girls. 

Well today we watched From Russia With Love and this movie converted her to a Bond fan, she absolutely loved and was laughing her ass off with James's antics and way he treats women (its comedy really) and she enjoyed the storyline as well. Tonight when she gets home from work in a couple of hours we are going to watch one of my favorites Goldfinger, and I've told her if she hates the DB5 (she is a car nut as well) then we are getting divorced.

Right now I'm looking into purchasing Bond-actor signed photographs. 
 
My question to you guys is; do you have any? Where did you buy them? Amazon has a few signed prints by the various bond actors (though I wonder about the authenticity)
Do you know any good places online where I could look?
Timothy Dalton is by far my favorite Bond and amazon has a nice print of Dalton in the tux, signed by him for $119.00 that I'm THIS close to purchasing, I just don't want to buy without browsing online first.

I don't know which collection is the best, and at the best price.

The Ultimate Editions look really nice and have great features, but are out of order.

The Actor Collections (Connery, Moore, and Brosnan) look quite clean, are dirt cheap, and have decent reviews, but are missing some films that I'd then have to get as individual DVDs.

Then there are the Blu-Rays, which I don't know are worth it for some of the older films. I'll probably get Craig's films on Blu-Ray, but stick with DVD for the other Bonds. 

Finally, there's the giant 50th Anniversary box set. I'm not really interested in this, mostly due to its prohibitive price point, size, and the fact that the films are in sleeves, rather than individual cases.

We as a sub-reddit have come so far in a year. Teekay101, lazerwolf852, and I myself joined the moderation team after BearFromPhilly took over. Myself and Bear became good friends, and we all care for this sub quite deeply. With the rapid growth of the amount of readers, and the release of Skyfall, I think this would be THE year to complete the first /r/jamesbond Best of 2012. I would like this to be extensively community driven, so please list some categories you would like to see voted on. When we have some of those picked out, we can stage a vote on the winners!

M was shot and did not say a word about it until it was too late. If she did say something about it they may have been able to stop the bleeding and she may have survived, but she understood the importance of the mission and she stayed quiet about it.

I'd only seen about half of them before now and hadn't seen a full Roger Moore film. (Mind blown, I love him)

So I also have this book by Deborah Lipp called The Ultimate James Bond Fanbook, and I've been reading her reviews of the films in there *after* I watch the film. For the most part I don't agree with a lot of what she says, but she brings up some interesting points, enough to keep me reading, and she definitely knows her Bond history. 

What I'm asking you is; what do you think of The Man with the Golden Gun and A View to a Kill?

I really enjoyed The Man with the Golden Gun, it's definitely flawed, but it ranks pretty high with me. I think Lipp was right to say that it's disappointing compared to film it *could* have been, but she really tears it apart and berates it overuse of ""smut humor"". I believe that she does indeed to her research and listens to what fellow Bond fans are saying, but she claims that fans hate this movie and it's song, which I happen to really enjoy.
I'd like to hear some other opinions.

Also, I finished A View to a Kill last Night and absolutely loved it. Again, flawed, but the things I loved about it are more numerous than the weaker points. When the credits rolled, I had such an awesome Bond-high, I grabbed my book to hear what what-her-face said about it and she gave it a 3/10 and it's her lowest ranked film. I was actually shocked because this has to be my favorite from Moore's era.

I know it's far from perfect and has many irritating aspects, but when it comes to Bond films, I tend to take them for their overall worth rather than nitpick about little things. This one, while weak in many areas, still gave me a fun ride, and that's what it's about right?

The 4th Bond movie takes as in an adventure under the sea in a mission to recover the nuclear warheads who were stolen by member of the SPECTRE organisation.

That member is Emilio Largo, by some people one of the better opponents for Bond, Largo and his shark would prove as tough opponent for our lovely agent but in the end..... see the movie and find out.

The 4th movie much like the previous 3 is based on the novel by Ian Fleming with the same name: [**ThunderBall**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderball_(novel)).

Following the success of the previous Bond movies a real Bond-Mania happened around the world as everyone wanted to see what is next for the British agent. This Bond-Mania had great result as [** ThunderBall**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059800/) became the top earner among the Bond movies for 47 straight years until a new challenger appeared. But about that later cause now we are going back in 1965 to review [**ThunderBall**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderball_(film))

So was this underwater adventure for your taste only? Or will you join me on the overly unpopular opinion-not liking [ThunderBall](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRqWFPLuzvo_9NBLJeyJbn-9NwF4I_yvlkwNHPmMQghEmyArrPd) ?

The Bond Theme was created by Monty Norman and John Barry. Norman came up with the basic riff, which he copied from an earlier song he wrote, [Good Sign, Bad Sign](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6EuzGhIyRQ).

John Barry then came in and helped fill the whole song out, also taking bits from an earlier song he wrote the music for, [Poor Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpsJIsGesTk).

Obviously, when combined, we get [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCIqK6YgkiE).

It is a franchise that has following throughout  the entire world. 

The novels by Ian Fleming, became a global phenomenon. The franchise about 007 inspired many young authors to start writing books, to dream that one day they will act in a Bond movie, even to spoof the world's most famous agent. Throughout the 50 years of Bond we've seen many parodies of the Bond movies, and many movies that were inspired by the majesty's agent.

But 3 movies will always be remembered as the movies that are the ""bastard child"" of the franchise. Bond movies that are not actually Bond movies. Bond movies that did not had the support by MGM, and movies that are really controversial. (while we are at the subject of controversy I would like to mention that throughout the 50years of Bond as we know it, MGM had many issues with the rights of Bond, and there were couple of Bond movies that were never made, but these 3 actually made it).

It all starts in 1954 with the first ecranisation of Fleming's first novel about 007. [Casino Royale starring Barry Nelson Jimmy/James Bond](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310853/).

If you haven't seen this episode/movie than you can check it out on YouTube by simply clicking at this [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bBnVDj5SkA).

The Daniel Craig and Nelson were not the only actors to portray Bond in a Bond movie called ""Casino Royale"". In 1967 a parody/comedy version of Fleming's novel even gets an Oscar nomination for the movie named ""Casino Royale"" and it has Peter Sellers, Ursula Anders, David Niven, Dalliah Lavi, Terence Cooper, and even Woody Allen playing the role of Mr. Bond. I know that this sounds crazy to you but in the movie it makes sense, so you should check that one out if you want to see the ""official"" James Bond parody.

The most famous ""unofficial"" (or non-MGM) Bond movie is [Never Say Never Again](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086006/?ref_=sr_1), and it has the original James Bond, Sean Connery in the role that brought him fame- Agent 007. Unlike the previous 2 movies this is more of an actual James Bond movie than the both versions of Casino Royale.

This will be a special week for BMOTW series cause instead of one you get to rate 4 (!!) Bond movies.

In the comment section bellow leave your ratings for SkyFall, Casino Royale (1954), Casino Royale (1967), and Never Say Never Again.

You can also write your review and your thoughts about the 3 Bond movies of the week.

If you haven't seen the 3 ""unofficial"" Bond movies you can see Casino Royale (1954): [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bBnVDj5SkA).

And you can purchase video/BluRay/DVD of Casino Royale (1967):

And now it's time to see how did you rate *Quantum Of Solace* last week:

  # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.5 | Casino Royale (2006)
2. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
3. | 8.7 | GoldenEye
4. | 8.6 | Licence To Kill
5. | 8.4 | The Living Daylights
6. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
7. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
8. | 8.2 | Dr.No
9. | 8.0 | For Your Eyes Only
10. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
11. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
12. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
13. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
14. | 6.2 | Quantum Of Solace
15. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
16. | 5.6 | The World Is Not Enough
17. | 5.6 | A View To A Kill
18. | 5.6 | Tomorrow Never Dies
19. |5.1 |MoonRaker
20. | 4.6 | Octopussy
21. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever
22. | 2.3 | Die Another Day


Kind of surprisingly but Quantum Of Solace with a score of 6,2 gets the (un)lucky 13th spot in the list.

Do you think that any of the last 4 movies in the series can make major stir ups in the list  ? Are the ""unofficial"" Bond movies the worst? Is the newest Bond the best? Follow our threads to find out.


Note: If most of you haven't seen the 3 movies mentioned in the thread, and think that it will take longer than a week (for any reason) to see all 3 movies, we will have another BMOTW next week, if not next week we will have our grand BMOTW finale where we will see the final results of this series. 

I hope that you are enjoying this series, and as always whatever you are doing stay safe and Bond on.",,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,GG,True,t3_1hgrv3,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1hgrv3/bond_movies_of_the_week_unofficial_bond_movies/,moderator

It became routine to watch director commentary and to hear them say ""we wanted to bring it back to Fleming...""

Very happy with the attention to detail each disc got, and the transfers are spectacular. Makes even the bad installments fun as hell to watch. 

The only two I'd never seen before I got the set were A View to a Kill and The Living Daylights. The former was hard to watch because of Moore's age, but I was very happy with TLD. I appreciate what Dalton tried to do with the character.

I just got Quantum of Solace after having problems with several rented discs. I realized that I had missed several important scenes, like the opera and sinkhole ones. With them in place, the movie flows smoothly and doesn't feel broken up. 

On the shaky camera: literally the only scene with shaky camera was the beginning car chase. Other scenes were *slightly* shaky, but nothing like Bourne, which everyone compares this movie to in terms of the camera. 

Overall, I think it's a lot better than most people think. 

Thanks for reading. 

Also, I heard No Good About Goodbye several times.

It is teen fiction, while it's nothing at all like the James Bond we all know from Ian Flemming and the movies, it's still pretty damn good.

Turning into a blind alley, Bond finds they're at a dead end, and the sharp, narrow-faced man wheels on him, clutching an attaché. Bond straightens the lapels of his coat, moving confidently towards another kill, when he stops, visibly straining toward the man, stumbling and falling. Behind Bond, silhouetted at the end of the alley, is a tall, stunning woman in a long coat with jet black hair, straight as a razor down to the middle of her back. I got it, says the thin-faced man, but she replies that it 
wasn't the bait they wanted, but the catch. She shoots him, and walks over to an unconscious Bond. We see his POV as she towers over his supine form and the camera zooms into the smoking gun barrel.

Opening titles:

Daniel Craig as James Bond in

Like Hell on Earth

Song by Nas

Images of a man, falling endlessly past trailing bullets, women in strong, powerful poses, streams of water, and spinning globes, finally crashing into a map of the world which seems to be made of clay and cracks and shatters on impact, fading into:

MI6 HQ, in apparent disarray. At the cubicle field, phones ring incessantly and the susurration created by many raises voices is more noise than words. M's door is open, an unusual occurrence, and Moneypenny walks into the office with a clipboard. We learn that in Europe's major capitols, MI6 installations are offline. Communication is sparse, but two high-confidence reports are in from allies. MUST in Stockholm and Sécurité in Paris report finding British operatives dead, with no outward sign of injury, but all in a rictus of pain, as if they had died from some unknown but torturous cause. Having made contact with some agents in the field rather than in station houses, M is putting together a picture. Q branch reaches out to a number of agents and starts a tracking map of confirmed alive, confirmed dead, and unknown. It's becoming apparent that the victims are intelligence gathering agents, not typically doing field work so much as tracking and analyzing intel, from the movement of money to communications between terrorist cells and higher-ups. To M, Q, and Moneypenny, one agent stands out as an unknown, with a flashing tag indicating On Assignment. M gives voice to the question that doesn't fit with the rest of the events: where the hell is Bond?

Bond is treading water at the bottom of a well. He has removed his coat and now ducks his head to untie his shoes as well. He probes at the walls for a possible escape, but looks up when the little light above is reduced by the frames of two people, an older man, cold and stony in the eyes, and the woman from before. Angelique, the old man says, wanted to be here for this. Her brother Dominic would have as well, but Bond had ensured that could not be. Bond has a flash of Greene standing in the desert, left to his fate and the grueling sun. 

The fate of Greene, we discover, inspired Angelique to pursue a new project, to revenge herself and her brother on his killer and to create a universal weapon turning life into ashes. Seawater, the old man tells Bond, is only 3.5% salt, but that solution is unsuitable drinking water for any man. Salts, like acids, are miscible with water, creating an evenly distributed mixture, a homogeneous solution. Oils, on the other hand, do not mix with water, and will separate from it, though they can be dissolved by strong acids, or strong bases. Sodium hydroxide, for example. Also known as Lye. With advances in nanotechnology, a laboratory in Berlin was working on new methods of low-temperature chloralkalization. With the development of a new, engineered sodium amalgam, a breakthrough was made. A brine that electrolyzed itself, creating a caustic soda and chlorine gas, simply by ad9ding it to water. Or by ingestion, for that matter, something a number of MI6 agents had discovered in the last few hours, he was sure. A slower acting, older version of the amalgam, designed to be consumed at a meal and then transform into chlorine gas and lye over the course of hours. Killing the victim by toxifying the water in their bodies, creating chemicals that burn and choke worse than the fire and brimstone of the biblical hell. A choice for you then, Mr. Bond, as you gave my brother a choice,  we hear from Ms. Greene: Choose to drown, while the water is pure, or choose to burn. It would be a while before this batch did the trick; the new amalgam works in only minutes. He has a few hours to think about it. In the cold, dark water. A large paper sack, rather like a bag of concrete, tumbles down and splashes a great spray before sinking. The lid slams shut, and the sounds of chains and locks can be heard above.

Bond claws his way up the slick well walls, pulling himself up the slick sides with only his fingertips along narrow ledges and crevices. As he climbs, the water below begins to react. Increasingly heavy fumes start to fill the well chamber as he nears the top. With one arm wedged under the well cover, he uses a swinging motion to kick at the hinged cutout where the cover bolts on. Choking and coughing more and more, Bond summons up the effort to splinter the wood and worm his way out into the early morning sun and air. A farmer's daughter is walking back toward an old farmhouse nearby with two milk pails, and Bond asks in German where he and the surprised Mädchen are, discovering he's in Altscherlitz, near Leipzig, some 120 miles southwest of Berlin. A moment later she trades a set of keys for a quick kiss as Bond gives her a winning smile and kicks some life into a 1970 BMW R75/5, roaring toward the nearest city.

Bond, back in touch with HQ, has a softer moment with Moneypenny on the phone when he realizes she was genuinely concerned for him. M prompts her to put Bond through, and the two men are discussing what's going on when Q interrupts to show M a communique from Quantum. The old man makes a simple statement: Quantum's operations exceed the scope of MI6 and Great Britain. Their machinations concern wealth in amounts unattainable by lesser G8 nations. Their worldwide influence, economically, is far vaster than England's,  as is their political weight. Should they so desire, they could cripple England economically in short order, but find it expedient to their purposes not to do so. However, it cannot be left to chance that MI6 should interfere with some operation at a critical juncture, and so a simple measure will be taken. The capabilities of MI6 will be crippled, destroyed, or turned to Quantum's purposes. Their global operations will be dismantled, agents targeted and buried. 

M speaks to Bond and they conclude he must target the lab where the sodium amalgam is made before any more can be produced and distributed. M advises that they have a friend in the area who can get Bond there quickly. Bond discovers how quickly when he follows instructions to a seeming scrapyard with a helicopter by a shed. He meets Stephan Suchomski, a Polish-German mechanic and pilot with a penchant for fast gyros. He advises Bond that their 200 kilometer trip will take about 45 minutes in his personally modified X2 Sikorsky. As he tore across the sky, Bond asked how he'd acquired the thing, which Stephan explained by telling him he helped them fix a little problem with the propellers. When it goes too fast, he said, the air goes over the blades and pushes down, and they used a feather design he thought up to channel the air. He took one of the prototypes in payment.

When they arrived at the lab, Bond jumped out onto the roof aided by a rappelling cord, and entered to find two of the scientists dead and an armed guard patrolling the area just beyond the foyer doors. He slipped through the door and snapped the unsuspecting guard's neck in a fluid, vicious, and lightning-quick movement. He disarmed the corpse of a combat knife in holster and an H&amp;K G36.  Making his way past humming machines with large storage units he edged toward the back of the lab. A second guard watching stolidly down a short hall also fell, the knife at the base of his skull. As Bond examined the rooms at hand he observes one apparently empty and the next still in operation. An older, round-faced man in a white coat, presumably the lab director, sat at a computer under the eye of Angelique Greene. Bond readied his weapon, and edged toward the doorway when the lab's PA system activated. 

The voice of the old man again. We were not expecting you, Mr. Bond. You really have proven quite formidable. No matter, though. Ms. Greene will see to ending your life once and for all now, and soon others in your organization will fall. We will pick you apart until you no longer pose any threat to us. Starting with you, oh it should be quite started now. Angelique has been mixing the new amalgam and the lab is even now filling with chlorine gas. Yes, you should be having quite a lot of trouble breathing, now, but unfortunately you'll find the lab is in lockdown and there is no escape. 

Throughout this, Bond was trying to escape the lab and finding even the internal hallway doors at connecting corridors were heavy steel and locked automatically. Tearing his sleeve to make a crude mask, he ducked into one of the cold rooms and pushed the door closed. He used the rest of his shirt as a jamb beneath the door, to keep the heavier gas from seeping in. Looking around, he found a vent hood and tried to activate it only to discover it had already been disabled. Angelique had been fanatical enough to ensure even her own torturous death in this building if it was called for. He was lost. Then he thought about the vent, and realized it had to have a direct outside air line. He tore down the aluminum housing and found the unpressurized tube, still too small for him to contemplate climbing. He could feel the burning in his nostrils and eyes as the chlorine gas pervaded the building. He swung up into the ceiling and began climbing along the vent shaft. At one point, the only way to continue upward was to climb by grasping a narrow strut connecting the shaft to a support beam, which was so thin and sharp it bit deep into his fingers drawing blood and a gasp of pain as he put his weight on the metal, digging it further into his hand. For the second time that day, he climbed upward from a pit of doom below, a poisonous world of choking and burning pain. At the roofline, he tried to drive his shoulder up off the side of a beam, and slipped nearly falling down back into the room below. He grabbed at the vent shaft and renewed his efforts after bracing his feet and shoulder. He felt the head of a roofing nail leave an impression in his shoulder as he drove through, then he was on the roof and quickly moving away from the now-deathtrap.

Bond was in M's office, and the head of MI6 was unhappy. Quantum is moving toward something, he said, and they want us out of the way. They believe they're in position to strike first and cripple us, and have their way. Well, that's been tried before. I do not aim to lose now. In fact, I aim to hit back. The newspapers may not say it in the morning, bit as of now this country is at war. It is us, or them. I mean to show them that war is hell. Hound them. 

Kill them, offered Bond. For a start, said M. So where do I start, Bond asked? 

Well, we've been thinking about that, M began. Now pay close attention, 007....


To be completed...

Sunday, 30 Dec 12.

Quantum want us out the picture. That means they feel we are a threat; well I mean to make them feel it keenly. Now they know we'll be sending you after them. They obviously see it as an opportunity to take you at as well. You're going to prove them wrong. You've been lucky so far, but we can't count on that. No, you're going to need an esge. Miss Moneypenny? M called on the intercom. Can you send Q in please.

Well, what have you got for me to play with this time? 007 quipped.

There's nothing childish about this, Bond. This vest is made of carbon nanotube lattice. At the moment of impact, the pressure of a bullet compresses the lattice, strengthening it and allowing the shockwave to pass into this Kevlar backing. This will stop even high-powered rounds, though you may feel a bit of a punch. These contact lenses will transmit and receive images via wireless relays in your clothing,  both dinner jacket and formal attire. This cigarette case is seemingly solid silver, but it will ignite if you press here and here; this activates the epoxy within, which will burn hot enough to get through any lock. Your phone will emit high-decibel frequencies until the object in view of the camera reaches resonance, allowing you to break through glass if necessary. Finally, your gun, Walther PPK, biometric encoding. I'd ask that you bring it back, the last one got me a phone call from a very angry herpetologist with an obstructed lizard.

What about a car? Bond asked.

M looked at Q and nodded. Q shook his head slightly. M once again nodded, perhaps a touch more forcefully, and Q, with some hesitation, finally assented. 

Fine, he said. The One-Seven-Seven. It's fully loaded; cd, dvd, air, machine guns, flamethrower-- plus armor reinforcing and leather upholstery. And we've added one or two special touches to this model. Note this rearview camera....

Edit: I am genuinely sorry, but Ive been sick and taking cold meds today. I was gonna beg off without writing anything but decided against. However,  my brain is too muddled and is doing kind of a weird buzzing NyQuil thing. I cant finish this tonight. I promise that I will tomorrow though. Sorry.

""007: License to Thrill"" played off the themes and popularity of ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" the most recent film at the time. IIRC, they only lasted one year.  

- The rides had a pre-show starring Judi Dench and props from the movie. While Bond was an MGM franchise, and not Paramount, they ride movie was licensed through Iwerks, the manufacturer of the motion simulators. They may have been at other parks too that featured Iwerks simulators.  

- Anyone ever ride one of these? I remember it being great fun. I was 10 at the time and had just gotten hooked on James Bond.   

- This video: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UCA4u1dCCU) takes a look at the ride that was in Virginia.  
Anyone know where you can find the actual ride video? I remember it used to be on YouTube some years back, but I've never found it since. I'd love to see it again.
