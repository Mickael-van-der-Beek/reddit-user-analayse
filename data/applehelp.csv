First, I'll cover some basics that I picked up over the years.

###About me

I worked at Apple as a ""Genius"" for several years in the early 2000's and now am part owner in my own Apple Consulting firm. 

###Software Problems

##Finding the cause, not the fix

Most of the work I did at Apple and do at my current job when confronted with a problem was not trying to fix the issue. The real helpful part is finding where the issue is.

OS X has an easy time rebuilding files that it needs. More often than not, removing the problem files will result in the OS automatically re-creating a fresh copy of the file without any issues. Finding these files is not too hard. Just narrow it down. As always, do a backup of everything incase you accidentally delete something that was more necessary than you might have thought. 

##User or System

Almost all software issues fall into problems with files within the User or System folder. A very quick and easy thing to try is to create a new user and see if the same issue you're having is happening there. 

If it does, you're dealing with an issue with something in the Application or System folders. Try re-installing the App or the [OS](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH3878?viewlocale=en_US). (Please backup first!)

##Libraries or Library

If your issue doesn't happen in the new user, you're problem is in your User folder. 

A few apps, like iTunes and iPhoto have Libraries that might prevent the app from opening. In either of those apps, press and hold down option when opening the app. This will allow you to create a new blank library. If that blank library doesn't seem to have the same issue as the main one, your problem is probably there. (Press and hold option again and choose your old library.)

All apps create a file on your Mac that keep track of how you like things setup. (Window size, customized settings, etc...) It isn't uncommon for this Preference file to get messed up to the point of causing issues with the App. To find it, open the Library. Open the Preferences folder and find the App in question. (It will be named in the following way: com.company.app, for instance, com.apple.iTunes) Move that file to the desktop (backup!) and remove it from the Preference folder. Open the app and see if it works. If not, but the backup file back. 

###Hardware Problems

Similar to the user/system steps with software issues, you can narrow the hardware issue down by trying to recreate the same issue with slightly different equipment.


##Hard Drive

An external drive with a copy of OS X installed has helped me more than anything else. If your computer is acting slow, not booting or a myriad of other issues, a drive like this can help you fix or recover your data with much less effort. 

##Safe Boot/Mode

Turn on your Mac and immediately hold down the shift key. Let go when you see the spinning gear or the progress bar appear below the Apple logo. This will scan your Mac for file system issues (and try to fix them). It will allow boot your computer with a lot of things can could cause problems disabled. (DVD Player, capture video, audio input/output devices, USB modem, WiFi...) If your Mac isn't booting, this can help you backup files before doing a reinstall. Reboot the Mac to get out of safe mode. 

##Other hardware

Some of these things might seem obvious, but worth mentioning.

Video looks distorted? Try an external monitor/TV. Or take a screen shot. If the other device or screen shot is distorted, you've got a video card issue. 

Sound not working? Try headphones or speakers. Also, look into the headphone jack. If you see a red light, the Mac thinks an optical audio connector is plugged in. This might be able to be fixed with a quick blast of compressed air or it might require a repair. 

###If it seems like you've tried everything, these couldn't hurt:###

I see these listed on the right, but I'll list them here anyway (Since I typed it out before seeing it.) These might not be for your exact issue, but it's worth a shot. 

##PMU reset##

This is a quick reset to a small component of your Mac that hold small amounts of data. Resetting this can help with more random issues than I can list here. This won't hurt anything, but will reset little settings like volume level. 

Restart your Mac. Press and hold the following keys: command, option, p, r.

Keep them held down until you hear the Mac startup sound once or twice. Let go and let it boot up. 

##SMC reset##

Another random step to try is to reset the SMC. Again, it won't hurt anything. I had a lot of people bring in their broken"" Macs just to have it work when they get here because of this.

Shut down your Mac then follow the next steps for what kind of computer you have.

#Desktops: Unplug the power cable. Wait 15 seconds. Plug it back in. Wait 5 seconds before pressing power to boot. 
#Laptops with removable batteries: Unplug from power cable. Take out battery. Press and hold power button for 5 seconds. Reconnect battery and boot normally.
#Laptops without removable batteries: Plug in the power cable. Press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time. Let go of all the keys at the same time. Boot normally.

That said, I thought it time to remind everyone here of one of /r/AppleHelp's few rules:

&gt;If it violates Appleâs EULA (Jailbreaking, Hackintoshes, Piracy, Torrents, and/or Betas,) it doesnât belong here.

We are ill-equipped to answer questions about or handle the issues that *will arise* from using beta software, as we are not members of Apple's internal software development teams. Even if any of us were, we'd be under *very* strict Non-Disclosure Agreements and wouldn't be able to help you anyway. The same goes for the other circumstances that would fall under this first rule.

**Please be aware that questions or comments that violate this rule will most likely be deleted.**

The good news is that there are subreddits which can help with all of your questions on these unsupported circumstances. Try a visit to /r/jailbreak, /r/hackintosh, /r/torrents, /r/illegaltorrents, or /r/iphone for help on these particular topics. If you have questions about illegal activities, don't bother asking any of these subreddits for help. They won't respond well.

The mod team here at /r/AppleHelp really appreciate your cooperation and understanding with this issue. Feel free to reply with comments, questions, or complaints about this policy.

It worked flawlessly. All the wine-stickiness on the right side of the board is gone, and it looks brand-new all over. 

Again, this was a **wired, non-wireless, aluminum usb keyboard ONLY.** NOT a whole computer, and NOT a wireless keyboard. I don't know if this will work with a wireless keyboard.

I put it in the dishwasher, top rack, with nothing else in the machine. I did not put soap in, and I didn't let it go through the dry cycle. I used the shortest ""delicate china"" setting on my dishwasher. After I took it out, I put it in a large plastic bag filled with instant rice, put it on a shelf and totally forgot about it for about three weeks.

The buyer used the buy it now within 10 minutes of the auction start (most potential buyers never see inventory appear in searches this early). Again, the buyer has a Chinese name, is in a large urban area, this time Chicago, and sees some kind of arbitrage opportunity. The only catch is that this time, I see that the guy is buying iphones nearly every ten minutes, and his feedback is around 16,000 (to give you an idea of the scale)

What's going on here?

I and one of my roomates have macbook Pros, my other roomate has a macbook.  We use the wi-fi of our downstairs neighbors (we pay them, we all know eachother).  Anyway, we all use Google Chrome, and we are having a serious problem with pop-up tabs opening whenever a link is clicked on and sometimes just spontaneously.

Usually these tabs will open after we click a google result, the url will flash something about google analytics before turning into some other web page, which is usually vaguely related to the original link that was clicked on.  Our friends downstairs, who all have pc's, are apparently experiencing the same issue.  I have also noticed this happening when I use my iPhone over the wi-fi (new tabs opening in safari) and just yesterday something tried to download itself onto my computer without any prompting, just a random file.  Of course Chrome caught it.

We have re-set the router to factory specs, as well as changed the password and network names.  Nothing has changed.  This issue is making our internet almost unusable.  Is there any sort of Google extension to block these pop-ups?  What is causing them?

As such, I'll also be filing a radar with Apple to complain about the way that App Resume is implemented**


**Edit 2: For you devs out there, I mirrored the radar I submitted on OpenRadar: http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1928401**


**Edit 3: For funsies, I decided to quit out of Sparrow, add it to the top of my Login Items, and reboot.  The result is that Sparrow itself still takes a long time to load up, but it doesn't impact the loading of the rest of the login items.  There is definitely an issue with the implementation of App Resume.  I will be updating the Radar filing accordingly.**

For a long time now, so long I can't even remember (probably back on Lion as well), my early 2011 MBP w/ SSD had been hanging up when loading startup items every time I rebooted.  It wasn't a *major* inconvenience because I seldom powered the laptop down completely, but I was having the same problem with my work iMac, which I do power down every night.  I knew that whatever was causing the problem was something common to both computers, and I had a few minutes of free time this morning, so I decided to do a little bit of experimenting to see what was causing the problems.

**My process**:

The first thing I did was to quit every single application and remove every single login item from Users &amp; Groups for my account.  This, of course, didn't account for the few apps that don't use the launch items plist but it was a start.  So I rebooted, and everything was up and running in a heartbeat, as it should be.

So I systematically started re-introducing every single one of my login items, making sure to turn on the ""show in menu bar"" option that I usually turn off.  After re-adding everything, I was still able to reboot and be cranking again almost immediately.

At this point, I knew that the problem wasn't with an actual login item.  The problem was with the App Resume.  So, one by one, I tried starting up apps, then rebooting to see how they interfered with load times.  First Safari.  Reboot with Safari running and a few Reddit tabs open.  Not an issue.  Terminal + TotalTerminal.  No problem.  Reeder.  Not an issue.

Then, Sparrow.  Launch Sparrow.  Reboot.  Sparrow's Menu Item was the first in the bar upon its App Resume, and immediately my system hung up.  Ctrl+Ctrl to trigger Found? Nothing.  Opt+Space for Alfred? Nothing.  TextExpander Snippets? Nothing.

Obviously, for some people, this isn't a *huge* deal because the system itself is still responsive.  You can still launch apps.  You can still interact with the GUI and the windows and *do things*.  But for me, controlling my system is almost 100% dictated by my ability to use Alfred, Found, TextExpander, and Keyboard Maestro.  So the fact that these processes are hung up for almost a minute when I'm on an SSD-based Mac is so incredibly frustrating.  Even worse is the fact that this isn't due to a conflict with other login items.  It's the result of an App Resume interfering with my login items.  So despite the fact that these four key applications are the first four in my list of login items, Sparrow is still pulling rank and trying to load up before them.  Admittedly, this probably isn't Sparrow's fault; I'd imagine it's the way the App Resume mechanic built in to the OS works.  But knowing this, it's the Sparrow people's responsibility to make the startup process of their application lightweight.  I say this as a software developer myself, so I know how difficult these things can be, but this is a major usability issue.

Anyway, I just wanted to throw this one out there for the community.  I'm fairly certain that the reason Sparrow locks up is because the disk I/O portion of their code that pulls in your email database isn't being run completely asynchronously so it prevents the entire application from loading until your entire email database is loaded.  But I'm not an engineer for Sparrow so I can't confirm or deny this.  I'll be filing a bug report, even though their Google acquisition makes it unlikely that they'll do anything about it.

FWIW I don't use Apple Mail and haven't since I bought this machine in March 2011 so I have no idea of Apple Mail causes the same issues.  Maybe somebody else noticing the slow loading of login items who uses Apple Mail can perform a similar experiment and chime in.",,False,,t5_2rfbh,1346702359.0,,3,True,t3_za8ot,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/za8ot/psa_ive_been_seeing_a_lot_of_people_upset_by_slow/,

When I woke up in the morning, my fan was still running loudly even after I stopped and properly deleted the program from my computer. Since then, my fan has been running at full speed regardless of what I'm doing. My laptop doesn't get warm at all. Actually, it's always really cool now.

Shortly after this happened, my battery started showing up as an X. Basically, my Macbook doesn't detect that there's a battery whatsoever unless my computer is plugged in. 

I know multiple people have had this problem and the only solution I've found is replacing the battery. Is there any alternative, cheaper way to fix this problem or is my computer pretty much shot otherwise?

**[UPDATE]** Thanks for the help everyone. Last night I let the battery drain completely. This morning I held the power button which is supposed to cause the internal battery to drain and reset all my settings.

I was having a conversation with my girlfriend and the situation in the screenshot happened.

She typed her second-to-last message, then I replied with two messages, then her again. On my phone, it shows up in the order indicated - her, me, her, me, because she and I sent our last messages at almost the same time, but hers got in first.

But when I looked at Messages on Mountain Lion, it was missing her last message for a second, then suddenly it rearranged. My 9:30 messages showed up above all of our 9:15 messages, but hers didn't.

Likewise, I was browsing back through a conversation with a friend from last night, which went something like this:

&gt; A
&gt;&gt; B

&gt; C
&gt;&gt; D

&gt; E
&gt;&gt; F

But it showed up like this:

&gt; C
&gt;&gt; B

&gt; E
&gt;&gt; D

In other words, all of her blocks of messages were shifted up one block of messages, which made the conversation a huge challenge to try to reconstruct. After that, I decided to come post this, and now when I look back at the window I see that our entire conversation from this morning (about 20-30 minutes) is completely gone from iMessage on ML.

Well today after getting home from work I've realized that this is a persistent issue. After playing around for a bit I've determined that unless I manually mount my share for time machine backups, it will fail to locate the backup share.

I never had any problems previously in 10.8.2 or 10.8.3 backing up to my Drobo 5n, it's officially supported and ready for usage with Time Machine. It's always automatically mounted my backup share from the drobo, just as my macs always used to automatically mount the share on my Airport Extreme that I've been using for years.

&gt;Thank you for this information, just to make sure I understand your issue you are having difficulties downloading your past purchases on your computer. I do want to apologize for this inconvenience. I will be more then happy to look into this for you.

&gt;Are you currently on your computer you wish to download the songs too?

&gt;yes

&gt;Not on this user. The computer is shared and a different itunes account is assigned to each user, but I've always used this account for mine.
&gt;
&gt;Jacob:
&gt;Okay, unfortunately iTunes recognizes the computer not different users separately. In order to download your songs you will need to wait the allotted time before being able to re-download your past purchased songs. I do want to apologize for this inconvenience.
&gt;
&gt;TostaMista:
&gt;But shouldn't I have been able to do this in the first place? I am signed into the account I purchased it with.
&gt;
&gt;TostaMista:
&gt;I also have done this before and have not had a problem.
&gt;
&gt;Jacob:
&gt;I apologize, but iTunes recognizes the entire computer not each individual user for the computer. Only a single iTunes account can be associated with a computer at a given time. Switching between accounts too many times causes this message you are receiving as its a security feature of iTunes.
&gt;
&gt;Jacob:
&gt;I apologize but you will have to wait the allotted time before trying to re-download your past purchases.
&gt;
&gt;

Any ideas on what to do? All help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi everyone and thank you for your help updating my MacBook.
I thought I would make a little update about how it went and see if anyone can help me with a problem I have been having.

The plan was to install a 128 gb SSD in the HDD bay and replace the optical drive with a optibay with a 500 gb HDD. It was surprisingly easy to install the optibay and with a Time Machine backup Lion was up and running on the SSD within 1.5 hours. 

[Install picture](http://imgur.com/Cu8nz)

I made two partitions on the HDD:

1) NFTS - Windows 7 for games and stuff.

2) Mac Journaled - For extra storage space.

There was no problem installing Windows on the HDD and have not run into a problem yet.


I have a MacBook Pro 13"" 2010, so the SSD won't be able to read/write as fast as on a newer Macbook, but the speed increase is quite noticeable still. I did disk speed test of botht the SSD and the HDD.

[HDD speed test](http://imgur.com/EIEbp)

[SSD speed test](http://imgur.com/zSI7n)

To enable TRIM on the SSD I used [Trim Enabler](http://www.groths.org/?page_id=322).

So all in all everything works and I can high recommend moving to a SSD.

Now for the questionâ¦ 
I have downloaded Spindown HD and can [see](http://imgur.com/LjQcA) (and hear) the HDD goes from ""Sleep"" to ""Active"" every ten minutes or so. I've set the HDD to turn off after not being used in 10 minutes, but it still turns again. There are no files on the Mac Journaled partition on the HDD so no program needs to access files from the HDD.
I started looking into how to get the HDD to turn off until I want to use it. I stumbled upon this [guide](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1214298).


I'm having problems making this work. I have disabled Spotlight completely, so that's not the problem.

I have copy/pasted the Applescript code into Alfred extentions as seen in the guide, but are still unable to unmount the HDD after running the script [(as seen here)](http://imgur.com/wXgWq).

I have also set the two partitions to not start up automatically in terminal (with the correct UUID's ofcourse).

[As seen in Disk Utility the HDD is not unmounted.](http://imgur.com/RBXZa). 
I like to give my partition names. Meet Sascha, my fast and furious Lion - Alice, Extra Storage Girl - Sam, the hot and noisy gamer.

Have anyone done this and can come up with a more detailed guide?

And is there anything else you recommend I do to make my computer faster, better or cooler?

I've use a variety of OS installs on this PC, everything from XP to Windows 7 to Windows 8.  My primary file server is a Mini running either 10.7 or 10.8 server.  Currently, my PC is running a fresh install of Windows 7 x64 with SP1 and all available hotfixes.

I connect the PC to a couple of 6 TB shares on the Mini, but I run into a very interesting scenario following a reboot of the Mini.

Every time I reboot the Mini, my shared drives which were previously reachable on the PC now come back and ask me for a username and password, and they don't accept my normal login credentials.  I am unable to hit any shared resources on the Macs.  After much troubleshooting, I discovered I need to go into System Preferences, Sharing, File Sharing, Options.  Then, I uncheck the user account, enter my password, uncheck the SMB sharing option.  Close out of System Preferences, go back in and reenable everything in the same order and it seems to work fine. 

For the sake of clarity, I have always performed clean reinstalls on both the Mini and the PC whenever I went to a new OS, I don't believe in upgrades, and I don't care for the crap they leave behind.  Still, this problem persists.  

Initially, I thought it was an issue with just OS X server, however I am not disabling/enabling the shares via the Server.app, I am doing it through System Preferences.  Also I have the same problem trying to connect to shares on my MacBook Pro (which runs 10.8 client) following a reboot.  I have to do the same trick to get the Windows box to reconnect to it as well.

Is this a problem with SMB, or do I need to do something different with regards to file sharing?

**TL;DR** - I have to cycle my SMB sharing options on my OS X boxes following a reboot, otherwise I cannot connect using a variety of Windows machines.",,False,,t5_2rfbh,False,,,True,t3_17bm5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/17bm5b/smb_bug_in_os_x/,

She's having an especially bad week. I won't sit here and whine about it because I feel guilty writing this already, but I just want to help her and unfortunately my computer skills and the Apple Genius bar's has come to a dead end so now I turn to my one guiding light in all of this. Yes you Reddit and your fellow patrons. So here's the deal.

My girlfriend has a 2009 white Macbook that has a hard drive that won't respond to the system (I think that's how the lady at the Genius bar said it). My options were to replace the hard drive and start over, which I did. The problem is that all of her information for the past 4 years is all on that hard drive. The great genius bar employee at the bar was able to tell me that it is possible to still retrieve the data from the hard drive from a third party vendor, but this could cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. One of the problems is that I am a nurse who is not a millionaire and my girlfriend's scum bag owner of the bar she works at and barely makes enough to pay rent just sold the bar and everyone is being let go, so she too does not have the money. She's honestly the sweetest girl ever and this hard drive (which the Apple store let me keep) and she has files for when she goes back to school and more importantly a ton of pictures of her and her grandpa to which she was very close on this hard drive with no other back up available.

I know this seems dismal, but does anyone have a solution or a cheaper solution? I am willing to shell out what money I have, but I really just want to cheer her up with everything that's been happening to us lately, especially since she's been getting the worse end of the proverbial stick.

Any help would be much appreciated and feel free to PM me. I usually don't get anyone who cares to respond to my questions, but I am really desperate to hope there is someone out there who can truly help me. Thank you for reading this and your time.

**Edit:** First off, thank you all for the great suggestions they all seem extremely promising. I'll be getting ahold of a 2.5 SATA tomorrow hopefully and will let everyone know if it worked or not!

I've tried to completely uninstall Java and re-install, which does nothing. I attempted to get back Java 6, but the directions I was trying were a little too complicated and wouldn't work.

I found an iPhone 4S on the street and have been trying to get in touch with the owner. However, the thing was turned off when I found it, and has a passcode. This means that I can't go into the phone to connect it to my wifi so the owner can trace it with find my iphone. Neither can I find any contacts nor can I make phonecalls. Is there any way around this? Or can you guys think of any other way to locate the owner? I already posted on several lost/found sites and contacted the police and provider (gave them the code on the SIM but that turned up nothing).

NOTE: No, I do not want to bypass the code to keep the thing for myself (I get that on a lot of other forums). If I wanted that, I would just completely reset the thing in recovery mode. That would, however, destroy all chance of finding the rightful owner.

EDIT: First removed my own SIM pin, then entered my own SIM into it so it would have internet. No Find My Iphone messages came up, and Siri didn't know 'me', my mother, father, office or home. Neither was there any music on it, so I think the phone was (remotely, possibly) wiped.

In my first store I started out with a windows based POS system and run quickbooks POS 2011. Its awful because of all the clutter, the tower doesn't even fit in a reasonable place and it just overall looks terrible. But the software is great. My employes are pretty fluent with quickbooks and dont really want to stray away from it. But now with starting a new store im having trouble trying to figure out what I want to go with.
 
I have owned windows computers for awhile and always had problems with them until my son talked me into a Macbook. I have had it for about 4 years and it has worked flawlessly and has had way less problems then all of the windows laptops I have had. I also have fell in love (like most apple users) with there design. Less cords, and just simple ease of use.

So I have been looking into buying an IMac to use as my POS system. I have been working with Apple's Business team to figure out what would be the best software for my liking. I am very stuck because I dont want to pull the trigger so fast and be unhappy, because most POS software is expensive along with Apple's hardware. 

POS software for OSX is limited and I have only found a few that seem to be the best out there. [Lightspeed](http://www.lightspeedretail.com/), [Runit](http://www.runit.com/), and [Checkout](http://www.checkoutapp.com/) are the three that I have found and feel might be the best. I haven't talked to anyone about their experiences with the software and wondered if anyone on this subreddit could help me make a better decision.  

My other thought was to run windows on the IMac with bootcamp and run Quickbooks again. But then again this brings windows back into the conversation and thats what I am trying to stay away from because of all the problems.

Any help would be appreciated.

Secondly, I want to hold my spot in one playlist while I navigate to another.  When I come back to the first playlist it has lost my spot and reset the playlist from the top.  This is exceedingly annoying when you're hundreds of songs down in a playlist, and want to come back to that particular spot.

Our Internet connection is 30Mbps down, 5Mbps up through Charter.  Speed Test consistently looks good with &lt;20ms pings and ~25Mbps / 4.2Mbps on the wire (I'm sure TCP overhead affects this score).  Apple TV is connected to the 5GHz band and the signal strength is ""Excellent"" with 5 bars.

My wife initiated an HD movie rental on the MacBook Pro last night and wanted to watch the movie on Apple TV.  We assumed it would appear on the Apple TV, but it did not.  We did some research through Apple Discussions and the Knowledge Base, and we came to the conclusion that rentals have to be started and watched on the same device.  (We do not use home sharing, and did not want to wait for the entire download to finish on the computer.)

So, disappointed, we dropped another $3.99 to rent the movie a second time on the Apple TV.  The stream said ""Loading..."" and then changed to ""Your movie will start in 4 hours, 25 minutes"" with a progress bar at the bottom.  We thought this was ridiculous, and then watched as the time estimate jumped all over the place from 1 hour, 18 minutes to 6 hours, 5 minutes, 3 hours 45 minutes, and you get the idea.

I checked the router throughput graph and saw that the Apple TV was pulling no more than 2-3Mbps the entire time, which is not fast enough to stream HD.  The AppleTV has no problem streaming high-bitrate video from our media server.

While we waited, we executed speed tests on wireless and over the wire.  Same excellent results as above.  We tried rebooting the router, unplugging the Apple TV, and disconnecting our Airport Express (at the suggestion of an Apple Discussions user).  We even set the AppleTV to connect to the 2.4GHz network.  Nothing changed.

Even for two people who do Mac &amp; Windows IT support as a living, this was getting to be a bit nuts.  I went to the Pirate Bay and found a 1080p BluRay rip of the movie; it was done in less than an hour, but too late for us to start watching it.

Password Problem.,problematicus,14,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/v75d1/bought_a_used_imac_off_of_ebay_need_help_password/,"So last week i bought a used iMac Intel Core Duo off of eBay for my mother so she could Skype and surf the internet.  It came on Friday, booted up fine, I installed all the necessary software and updated the OS to 10.6.8. So while all this was happening the screen saver came on and I thought nothing of it.  After about 30 minutes I went over to the mac to wake it and it asked for a password, which of course I don't have.  I've tried to contact the seller but i haven't gotten any response.
So, r/applehelp, here is my question to you.  How do i get around this problem?  I have tried using the Snow Leopard install disk to reset the password.  But that's not working.  I put the disk in and restart and press the C key at the chime but it takes me right back to the password prompt window.  I've also tried an external optical drive, thinking that the OEM might have been defective, but i get the same results. I have tried pressing other keys at start up and it still takes me to the same screen.
Any help would be appreciated.

tl;dr Bought a used iMac that had a password on the screensaver.  HELP!



Edit 1*
I have tried everyone's suggestions, but nothing has worked. Thank you all for your help. I guess I'm just gonna have to tuck my tail between my legs and have IT take a look at it on Monday.  It's just so odd that the Mac isn't accepting any keyboard commands prior to start up.  I unplug it after every shut down press and hold the commands before the chime and if the doesn't work ill shut it down and do it after the chime.  I've tried 2 different keyboards 2 different drives, but nothing seems to work.  
I will keep you all updated... I'm baffled.
Thank you again.

And here is proof that I'm not a complete moron(hopefully). I was pressing command S and got nothing in return.  
http://youtu.be/5ap0LsYnAl0

Edit2* I took the mac to my companies IT department, and they are saying the previous owner used file vault and my only recourse is to replace the HD.  I'm going to give the seller until the end of the day today to respond to my e-mails and then I guess I'll crack it open and replace the HD.
Lesson learned... Dont buy used computers off eBay
Thank you everyone for your help and suggestions.  

Edit*3  The password has been cracked!
Like I said earlier, I left the Mac with a friend in IT, and he figured out the password through some Google-ing...
The user name was Jonah Jameson, with the password being... wait for it... spiderman.
It just never clicked in my head that Jonah Jameson was that Jonah Jameson.

* So I bought this thing with Snow Leopard. Is there a way to upgrade free to Lion since I just paid so much money for a new machine? It came from Best Buy
* Right click? WTF? Magic Mouse is cool, but are there right-click context menus I should worry about?
* I downloaded Geektool -- looks sweet -- are there places I can get more to use than what came with the app?
* I have been a diehard Windows user since I was 8 (which was about 20 years ago, lol). Is there a graphic that shows common commands that interchange between windows and mac? or cool ones for mac I can learn? I've played with the command key and have figured out quite a bit thus far, seems pretty legit. 
* If you were showing your iMac off to someone who was computer literate and wanted to see cool, interesting things OSX/your machine does, what would you show them?

After about 2 years of laptop only use for all my computer needs with sporadic desktop use at uni (they have imacs) I have come to the realisation I probably need a desktop PC, I'm also having a little posture and elbow problems which I feel the laptop isn't helping.

Having limited desk space, an all-in-one looked pretty good. Looking at the imac's, the only one I can really consider is the very cheapest model, after that I feel the price per performance value gets pretty terrible. And even then I could get a better PC at that base model price.

I'm not trying to troll, and I would really appreciate iMac owner's opinions on their worth.
Is it worth shelling out the cash for the 'compactness'? I do really want the sexy as iMac, but I also want to be smart with my money.

P.S
I'm studying Engineering (CAD etc probable in the future), though all I need right now is general office use.

They replaced both the logicboard and both sticks of RAM. I'm not sure if anything else was done.**


I bought my computer in August of 2012, and it's a [macbookpro9,2](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4132?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US). I'm not sure if this has anything to do with what is going on, but ever since I bought my computer I have noticed that when I move my computer around, and sometimes just on it's own, it makes a weird clicking sound on the left side of the trackpad.

Now, before I tell the story, I'll give a little more information about my computer.

It's a macbookpro9,2
I do have the warranty from Apple.
My internal hard drive is 750GB.
I dual boot my computer with Mountain Lion and Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS.
I also have quite a number of partitions.

* Mountain Lion is the main partition, with a little over 500GB.
* There's an 8GB partition of Linux Swap.
* There's a 1MB partition for BIOSGRUB.
* There's a 25GB partition just for a shared partition because OS X doesn't recognize Ext4.
* There's a little over 100GB for Ubuntu.
* There's the EFI partition, of course.
* And there's also the OS X recovery partition.

I also use [refit](http://refit.sourceforge.net) as a bootloader.

**Story time!**

Anyways, so for the past two weeks my computer has been acting up. If I move it *too* much, or even if I don't move it at all sometimes, it decides to freak out. Lines go across the screen, **in a different pattern every time**. I managed to take a video of it the last time I had my computer on me. Here's a link: [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3dutrtmjr8ho3oj/2013-03-21%2009.22.57.mov). Sorry about the vertical video, I just wanted to capture it before it stopped happening. That being said, once it stopped, I would have to force shutdown the computer, for it would become *completely* frozen.

Then, on Thursday, it was happening again. Only this time, it didn't want to start up anymore. It just beeped.

So my fiancÃ©e suggested that I take it to the Apple store in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. It was only a few minutes from where I was currently, so I said sure. I made an appointment, got there early, and they ended up helping me early as well. I showed one of the guys at the Genius bar the video and started the computer up. It did start up, and I did mention to him about the beeping. He ran some preliminary tests and the computer **passed** all of them. He suggested that I leave it there and that he'd run more tests and give me a call before 4pm that same day (I dropped it off at about noon).

So I waited, and never got a call. I figured they were just busy, and I didn't think anything of it. I called them at about 7pm the same night, and they said they think they figured out the problem. They said it was most likely a RAM problem and that they were just going to switch out the old RAM for some new RAM. They didn't have any in stock though (what computer store doesn't have RAM in stock?), so they had to order it and they said once it got there they'd fix it and give me a call. They guestimated that it'd be fixed on either Friday or Saturday, depending on when the part came in.

I called on Friday at about noon, just curious to see if the part came in. The guy I talked to was a complete asshole to me and said that they'd call me when it's done. *That's it.* He didn't explain anything else, only that it was customary for them to call the customers upon completion. I didn't really think anything of that either. I know I called early, but I was just hoping for it to be completed. 

So I decided to wait; there's no point in harassing the workers if they're working on it. Saturday arrives, and I give them a call at about 2pm to see if they were working on it. I called at 2:10pm and talked to someone who said it wasn't complete yet and they'd give me a call back once it's done. Pretty much exactly the same response as I got the day before. I got a call at 2:35pm and I actually got to talk to one of the Genius bar people. He was much nicer, and actually, all of the people at the Genius bar were much nicer to me than the other employees. He said that it wasn't a RAM problem. They swapped the RAM for some new RAM, and it was still acting up. He suggested that they replace the logic board, but that they didn't have it in stock (yet again). I told him that I really need to get some files off my computer first because I have class on Tuesday and there is a lot of things that I have to do, all of which are on my computer. He said that was fine.

So I came to the store and he gave me the computer, but it wouldn't boot. Neither OS would boot. It would get to where I can choose which OS to boot, and then if I booted Ubuntu it would just restart the computer, but if I booted OS X then it would just stay on the apple logo with the gray-white screen forever. He said that if I wanted to run it over to the other Apple store in Marlton, New Jersey, that they had a logic board in stock for me and they could fix it overnight. I said that sounded great and he called them back up and told them to hold it for me.

Also, when he gave me my computer back he gave me the computer and a stick of my RAM. I asked why it was out of the computer, and he said that it wouldn't boot at all with both sticks in, but if he took just that stick out then it would semi-boot. 

So I took it to the other store and they told me that they'd call me when it was done, most likely the next day, Sunday. I didn't bother to call them Saturday night. I figured it would be better just to wait until Sunday and give them a call if they don't call me.

Sunday I called them at 2:10pm and talked to someone for a little bit. It was just a normal employee at first, who gave me a hard time, and then they transferred me over to the guy who was physically working on my computer at the time. He said that someone had replaced the logic board the night before, but they were still having problems with it. He said he needed to run some more tests and he'd call me back in a few hours at the latest. The time went on, and when it reached 6pm I knew they weren't calling back. The store closed at 6pm yesterday because it was a Sunday. 

----

So for whoever read this whole thing, what do I do? I desperately need it back today. What options are there even? Could they just give me a new computer, regardless of the fact that it'd be a different hardware model? Does anyone actually know what's going on with the computer?

Right now I have the 2.4ghz 2008 blackbook with 6 MB or ram, original hard drive, and the onboard Intel GMA X3100 graphics processor.  What I'm looking for is a computer to plug into a large screen TV that will act as my monitor.  I like my current laptop, but it's starting to limp along, and the graphics were outdated when I bought it (it wouldn't run Civ V when that came out, for instance).  I'm not too hard on my processors; my most intense uses are probably Minecraft or Civ-type games (and youtube, apparently, which sends the computer's fans wild).

I'm looking at either getting the 2.6 ghz Mac Mini with the 1 tb fusion drive and max ram (that I'll purchase on my own) to run the TV; or the 2.7 ghz 15"" (non-retina) MBP with the NVIDIA graphics card and upgrading the drive and RAM on my own.

My concerns with the mac mini are that it only has the intel graphics, of which I am very suspicious that it won't actually be able to drive games displayed on the TV, and then I won't also have a laptop.  My concern with the laptop is its hefty price and weight, and that I'm not getting the retina version.

I'm currently running 10.7.5 Lion and therefore will have a Lion backup. They ask that you have your original OS installation disk, but that is Snow Leopard.

I've read that you can't restore a Lion backup into Snow Leopard AND I can't just upgrade to Mountain Lion because my copy of Logic Pro 8 would then be unsupported. Is there a way to reinstall Lion? I never made a copy of it like some recommended and the OSs get replaced in the App Store by newer versions.

Would I have to upgrade to Mountain Lion and buy Logic 9? I've been waiting out for Logic 10/X so I'd  like to only buy Logic 9 as a last resort.

My plan of attack is to put a new harddrive in first to see if that was the problem, then maybe try replacing the RAM, but I wanted to see if any of you much cleverer people had better suggestions. Are they any methods for me to isolate the problem short of buying new RAM/harddrives and replacing them? I don't currently have any other RAM on hand or a harddrive I can just chuck in there to check, so anything would necessitate some purchases.

Edit: UPDATE! 

I got a new hard drive, bracket, screws etc., and made a time machine back up of my existing computer onto it. I then installed it in the broken MBP and booted from an install DVD - no dice. Didn't recognize the drive or anything. I tried cloning my working drive instead using Carbon Copy, still nothing - the MBP just refuses to recognize the drive at all, and would only show the install disk as the only available disk.

I just sent for a osx snow leopard disc, waited for it to come in the mail, etc. And it finally came. I installed it and it gave me the version 10.6.3. Unfortunately I need to gain access to 10.6.8 for xcode to work.. which is the whole reason I spent 20 dollars to get snow leopard in the first place. 
Is there a more direct way to upgrade to 10.6.8 or do I need to go .1 at a time until I get there. Will this even work? This has been a 3 week process now and I just would like to program on my computer.

Is there an older Xcode I should have access to with this version of OSX? I really don't know how to find out as someone helped me get the xcode I have right now, which is 3.2. Apparently they don't even offer support because my computer is too old.

This has worked well for me in the past, allowing me to make minor adjustments to the placement of the protector and making it easier to get out bubbles.

That didn't work quite as well with the iPhone. I turned it off prior to starting the protector application process, and I was very careful that none of the solution (I used eyeglass cleaner) got into the speaker placed beneath the front-facing camera. Anyway, I already feel like I'm overdescribing what I did--I'll provide more details if you want them.

Trouble is, upon turning on the iPhone, my screen looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/R5gC8.png) when trying to display a white screen. In person, it is apparent that there is a blue tint to the affected areas of the screen, but there are some areas that seem completely OK. 

BTW, that last picture was taken with the screen protector off, about a day ago. The pattern has since changed a bit, plus it varies pretty drastically based on the angle at which you look at the screen (see: [this](http://i.imgur.com/ERt6C.png)). Everything works fine, but the screen now has these defects. It's pretty clearly due to water trapped somewhere underneath the top layer of glass, but what should I do? Should I let it dry? Put it in rice?

If I take it to the Apple store (note: I didn't buy any additional protection), will they claim the phone has suffered water damage, which is an accident not covered by the standard warranty? Keep in mind that, wherever the water damage indicator is on this iPhone, I doubt it got ""activated"". The only places I can imagine the water having entered is around the home button, and maybe the very edges of the screen (but the water didn't get down the sides, or into the headphone jack).

**TL;DR [This](http://i.imgur.com/ERt6C.png) is what my screen looks like after spraying some mist when applying a screen protector.

Hopefully you guys will have a clue, because AppleCare didn't seem to!

Anyway, here's the situation: I work IT for my company and we're a Windows Server environment. Occasionally though, a user requests a Mac, and I'm happy to oblige despite certain inconveniences. In the past, Snow Leopard gave me no trouble whatsoever with what I'm doing, but with Lion it's been nothing but a pain.
So I get this new MBP, set up a local admin account, and join my Active Directory domain. That went fine. Then I log out of the local admin account, and I get this ""Other..."" button at the login screen that lets me type in my personal Active Directory domain credentials, creates a mobile network account on the Mac, and lets me access other network resources that require LDAP authentication, seamlessly, no problem.

Then I installed something that required a reboot, so I rebooted, and here's where the problem starts: I get to a login screen with a white background, with a gray Apple logo near the center, under which there's the icon for my local admin account and a field to fill in the password. No ""Other..."" option.
It looks like http://i.imgur.com/ivd3n.png if you want to see a screenshot.
 
So I log in to the local admin account, then immediately log out, and then it takes me to a completely different login screen with a dark gray patterned background with three options:
- My network account I just logged in as before rebooting
- The local admin account
- ""Other..."" (which lets any user in my Active Directory log in)
Once I get to that login screen, I'm fine. It looks exactly like http://i.imgur.com/nEE6f.jpg except it says ""Other..."" instead of ""Guest User"" under the icon on the right. Also the icon itself shows three silhouettes of heads and shoulders (one in the front, two in the back on either side of the first one) instead of a single silhouette.
 
As far as I'm concerned, if I had to go this log in/log out/log back in routine every time, it would be obnoxious but not a huge deal because I have the local admin password. However this Mac is going to one of my users, and I don't want him to have the local admin password.

I'm hoping you can help me solve an internal debate. I'm sorely in need of a Mac upgrade, my 4-year old black MacBook is on its way out. So I love the retina display MacBooks, specifically for the screen and the flash storage. I'm trying to decide what perks to include now.

I'm a graphic design student, so I'm using Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver on a pretty regular basis. Not for anything *huge* but for regular-size stuff. 

Here's what I want:
â¢Lower-end rMBP, 2.6 GHz
â¢RAM upgrade (from 8GB to 16)
â¢USB SuperDrive
â¢AppleCare 

Do I need all that stuff? I guess I'm trying to shave some of the cost now, and I'm thinking about waiting to get the AppleCare (it doesn't kick in until after the first year, right?)

The RAM is something I really need some help on. Apple's site says it's not upgradeable after purchase, so if I'm going to need 16GB, I need to know now.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: So I bought the computer. After weighing your opinions and those of my parents and girlfriend, I decided to get the extra ram (u/groberts1980 made a good argument there) and the USB SuperDrive. The SuperDrive was a hard decision, but in the end it came down to relative cost (just $79 compared to the final, huge price tag) and the reliability I can expect with it. Plus it looks fancy. I'm holding off on the AppleCare for now, which I think was an obvious decision.

First, I will be buying the 2012 (non retina) 15"" Macbook Pro and I am unsure of whether or not I should invest in the anti-glare display. I see that the resolution is higher and the screen provides less glare, but are both of these noticeably different? I've read that the colors are more vibrant on the glossy, but is the glare that bad? 

Second, Apple charges $180 for a 128gb Solid State Drive and I was wondering if it was worth it to have them install it for me. I am aware of the benefits of an SSD and I really want one, but I've read some other posts that say buying a 3rd party SSD is the cheaper option. This may be true, but following this suggestion is a large list of instructions to make sure it works properly and I am not sure if it's worth the hassle. 

However, I saw that with Mountain Lion one can download the OS via an internet connection to a hard drive that does not have the OS already on it so that may be more convenient. 

The posts relating these 2 questions were a little outdated and so I chose to ask them again seeing as technology is always advancing. 

Also any suggestions on 3rd party SSDs would be greatly appreciated (suggestions were available in posts similar to this one, but they were a bit outdated).

Thanks guys

Apologies if similar questions have been asked, but I have noticed a lot of posts use a lot of terminology/explanations that I simply don't have the knowledge to properly use. Consider this an 'explain it to me like I'm five' sort of situation. I like computers and I know how to use them, but I'm not a programmer or an engineer, so my knowledge is basic. I have a late 2008 Macbook, model number A1278, 2 GHz Intel Processor Core 2 Duo, 5,1, with a 149GB capacity, 77GB available, 2GB memory (or RAM, I guess?), running OS 10.5.8. I haven't made any real software or hardware changes since I bought it in January 2009, but just over time it is starting to run extremely slowly. Physically it is still in excellent condition, and I am wondering if it would be worth it to make some upgrades, like increasing RAM and upgrading to the newest OS. I've read the specs which says to only upgrade to 4GB of RAM, but that people have upgraded all the way to 8GB with the appropriate software updates. I don't run any large or high tech software, but with upgrades, I would like to be able to run programs like ArcGIS or CorelDRAW. I was thinking to do an upgrade to 6GB along with a full upgrade of Mac OS. Or would 4GB be good for my purposes?

Specs:
 * 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor
 * 500 GB HDD
 * 4 GB RAM

For $650, I get the HP ENVY dv6t-7300, which has
* 2.4 GHz quad-core i7 processor
* 750 GB HDD
* 8 GB RAM
For $50 you can add a 32GB SSD Hard Disk Cache for speeding things up

I've tried searching for info on this, but I'm not quite sure how to word my question in order to return good results. Here's what's going on with my Mac:

I recently bought a Mini and 2 x 23"" IPS displays, which I love - but it's almost useless for me to have that 2nd display, because whenever I play a game in full screen, or hit the 2 arrows in my browser to maximize it to full screen, the other monitor becomes useless.

When I play a game, it goes black. Not like it's turning off, but rather more like the black around the edges of the game, or at the top/bottom of letterbox mode. When I full screen my browser, the second monitor gets filled up with a gray, textured background and I can't do anything with it. 

The right monitor is the main, with the dock at the bottom and is hooked up with the HDMI to DVI adapter, and the left monitor is using the Thunderbolt to DVI. Both displays are running at 1080P resolution, and both work fine if I don't have anything full screen, which really defeats the purpose of 23"" monitors.

I'm hoping someone can help me out, maybe I've got a setting wrong, or maybe that's just the way Apple functions, or maybe I should reverse the adapters. I'm at a loss here, and I can usually figure these things out. I've been working in Windows IT for 14 years, and this is my first venture into Mac. So far, I love everything about it, except this.

I'm willing to go back down to a single monitor, if necessary, as I'm within my return policy on both of them.

Anyone else experience this or better yet, have a fix? 
It worked fine on iOS 5.

Update: Still no fix, but I thought I'd document what did not work...
First, I increased the autolock time to 5 minutes. It still did not sync when plugging in to power. 
Next, I killed all the apps. Still, no sync. 
Next, restarted the iPod. No sync. 
Next, attempted to initiate sync via iPod general settings. Did not sync. It seems that it could not find the Mac.
Finally, remoted into the Mac and initiated sync via iTunes. This worked. (Though sometimes it doesn't work until after I restart iTunes.)

It seems that somewhere in the process ITunes and the iPod loose a tight connection. iTunes still shows the iPod is present, yet it will not sync automatically when the iPod is plugged in to charge or when sync is initiated from the iPod. 

So... I guess I will just have to manually sync every morning until Apple figures this out. I'll be sure to report the issue, but I would hope they are already aware of it.

* Do most apps auto-backup their data to iCloud?

* If your device goes obsolete (I feel like the Mini will lose support *fast*) and an app on the App Store stops supporting your version, are you able download from the store an older version of the app?

* Does lightning-&gt;HDMI out work on screens of arbitrary resolution (I'm considering getting an old dell LCD monitor, which isn't 720p or 1080p)

* What is considered ""usage time"" in the battery monitor? All time with the screen on, or does it include music playback with the screen off as well?

* How is the WiFi range on the iPad?

* Any PDF that works on a Mac should work on an iPad, right? iOS seems to have, architecturally, the best and smoothest built in PDF support...

*less important, more for confirmation*

* For music apps aside from the iOS iTunes, will they maintain control of the double-tap music controls over long periods of time? (i.e. my Nexus on cyanogen will keep the play button for TuneIn and Google Music but after a few minutes stops working with Spotify).

* Can I delete music from the iPad without the Mac iTunes trying to put it back on?

* Can third party apps use alarms? (i.e. Android TuneIn can set an alarm for a radio station)

Therefore, since I no longer use my optical drive - I wish to replace it with a SSD. However, my problem arises in the fact that the early 2011 Macbook Pros only had a SATA III (6Gbps) channel for the harddrive, but not the optical drive (SATA II, 3Gbps). 

The simple solution to this would just be to place the hard drive in the optical drive slot, and place the SSD in the old hard drive slot. However, the Macbook's only have a sudden motion sensor on the hard drive slot, not the optical. This means that if the hard drive was in the optical bay, and I moved my Macbook suddenly, like I frequently do, it is prone to break. 

So what do I do? Is there a minor difference in SATA II v SATA III speeds, therefore negating the need to have the SSD on the SATA III channel? If not, are the hard drives very prone to break if moved and not spun down by the motion sensor?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1352269196.0,12,self.applehelp,12s7o8,Help picking an iPad for my [legally blind] mom?,bastawhiz,13,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/12s7o8/help_picking_an_ipad_for_my_legally_blind_mom/,"A little background: My mom is completely blind in one of her eyes and has irreparable optic nerve damage in her other eye (i.e.: glasses don't help) due to glaucoma as a teenager. She has never used a computer, though she understands how it works and most of the core functions of it (I'm a software engineer, my dad is a hobbyist; she picks up on bits and pieces).

Right now, she is able to text using a Nokia flip phone (!) through the use of a high-power magnifying glass and muscle memory. T9 is the only way that she knows how to ""type"".

For Christmas, I want to buy her an iPad. I've heard that they provide exceptional accessibility features, and I think my mom would take well to using the device. Even if she limited her usage to taking pictures, email, playing music, (maybe....probably) Words With Friends, and other simple stuff, I think she'd get a pretty good deal of use out of it.

I'm having trouble picking one out, though. Here's my breakdown; please let me know your thoughts.

* iPad 3rd gen: It has Siri, which would make it a whole lot easier for her to do simple stuff without having to do a lot of tapping/looking at the screen. It has a ""large"" screen. Downsides: she has literally zero need for a retina display or a fast processor; somewhat expensive. Not incredibly portable.
* iPad 2nd gen: It's cheap and the screen is ""large"". Very thin, which I think would work to her benefit (the more compact, the better). No features that she doesn't need. Downsides: No Siri, not incredibly portable.
* iPad Mini: Cheap and compact. The screen is probably sufficient in terms of touchable area (maybe?). Siri. Downsides: Is it too small to use the iOS accessibility features easily?

I'm really leaning towards the Mini, but my biggest concern is that the screen won't be big enough to use the accessibility features well on. Can someone give some feedback on that?

Some notes:

* Cost isn't a barrier. I can afford all three, but I'd prefer to spend less money if I could.
* The screen resolution is literally meaningless. Retina won't be of any material use to her.
* She'll never use the Maps app (or anything with GPS, probably), don't care about that.
* She won't be having 3G or any other cellular service with it.
* She has a Gmail account (my dad checks it for her now)
* She doesn't need a whole lot of space. She likes to take pictures of birds and my cats (we literally have SD cards FULL of bird and cat pictures, most with her finger obscuring the camera in some way), but she doesn't have anything that couldn't be uploaded to Dropbox or whatever if need be. She won't need more than the smallest amount of space (16gb?).
* My parents own no other Apple devices whatsoever (and probably never will).

I haven't done a clean install since Mac OS X Leopard (that I can remember! Maybe it was even earlier than that). So since 2007 at least.

I switched macs many times and always used migration assistant and more recently time machine to transfer everything...Users, settings, apps, Libraries, Preferences, etc.

I just bought a Retina MBP, and although I have no issues or conflicts or bugs whatsoever (imagine that if this were a windows machine haha), I am getting a little OCD with the amount of random crap floating around in the form of dead preferences for long gone apps, stuff in the library, stuff in the system library, etc. 

I want to do a Clean install with Mountain Lion. A few questions:

1. What are the best practices/tips to do one? (What is the most painless way to do it?)

2. What about stuff I do want to transfer from my time machine? I am aware that I can transfer the documents folder, movies, pictures, etc separately from the time machine... But what about all my emails, chat logs, etc? Aren't those in the Library? (transferring the library would defeat the purpose).

3. Is this even worth it?? Should I bother??

I'm now thinking of replacing my home theater PC (a Dell Studio Slim Desktop) with a Mac Mini. I considered an Apple TV instead, but I use my home theater system exclusively for playing games, web surfing, and watching DVD ISOs - don't even have cable - so the Mac Mini seems like a better choice.

For those who are using a Mac Mini in a home theater context, I have a few questions:

* How is the noise level? I fully expect a Mac Mini to be quieter than my current machine (which isn't actually an HTPC, and the fan is remarkably loud); just curious about what I should expect.

* How is the Mac Mini at streaming video from DVD ISOs streamed from a NAS? Do you recommend any particular software for playing DVD ISOs - e.g., an equivalent to WinDVD? (Currently I use VLC, but it's kind of a hack - e.g., it starts playing the largest VOB, rather than just showing the main menu).

* Are you generally satisfied with its performance? Would I be satisfied with running non-performance-intensive games via a Parallels Windows image / DOSBox / MAME?

* Mac Rumors suggests that a new Mac Mini is just around the corner. Should I wait (guessing the answer here is yes) or just take the plunge now?

Thanks in advance...

I migrated from a MacBook Pro to a Mac Mini to have a little beefier desktop but have been having trouble with Bluetooth and my Magic Trackpad from day 1. I should note that this was a clean install of 10.7.0 followed by all patching. The trackpad connected, but I could not see it in the Bluetooth menu's list of devices and every time I rebooted it'd disappear. It also would show connected but not paired. Also, every time I went to add it back, even though the Bluetooth preferences said the radio was on, it asked me to turn it on because it was off.

Long story short, after digging around in the logs I saw some stuff that didn't make sense, about blued not being able to sync. So some more googling and I get a list of files to remove. Only problem was that they were directories instead of files. So I unpaired and deleted everything that the Bluetooth system knew about (probably not needed, looking back). Then ran the following commands (as root) to delete the offending files:

    rm -rf /var/root/Library/Preferences/blued.plist*
    rm -rf ~&lt;USERNAME&gt;/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth*
    rm -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist*

I then rebooted and paired the trackpad. Everything worked perfectly and has been functioning as expected (including getting battery level) since.

Strange that those .plist files got created as directories instead of files, but whatever. Nuking them fixed my problems.

Standard disclaimers apply. It's a nuclear option and you shouldn't blame me if you break your system. I had a full backup I could restore from if I really trashed things.

I previously posted about repairing a slow imac with missing pictures.  I found most of the pictures in a random library folder, but I decided to reinstall the OS because the customer actually has disc 1 and 2 of Tiger.  

However, after successfully wiping the machine with Disc 1, Disc 2 will not work.  I tried using a mechanical hand-crank cleaner, perhaps 20 times, and it continued to spit it out.  I had Family Video polish the disc, and it finally tried to copy files, then quit.  I had them polish it a second time, and it got to iWork, and now it's kicking out an error message saying ""Install failed: Some files for iWork extras may not have been written correctly""

One thing I notice is that Disc 1 and 2 are different.  Disc 1 has the typical chrome finish of a retail DVD.  Disc 2 has a blue/purple finish, identical to DVD-R's.  I hypothesize that Disc 2 (the application disc) gets burned by Apple right before the OS is installed, because it ensures the applications are up to date upon delivery.  Disc 1, the OS, gets stamped like a normal disc.  Disc 1 is quite scratched and reads fine, but Disc 2 can't read properly even after being polished perfectly.  

Has anyone else had this problem?  Or has a solution?  I called Apple and (of course) they don't support anything over a month old, and told me that, unless a NOS retail version of Tiger is laying around the warehouse, I'm out of luck, and I'd probably have to pay for it anyway.  Even though my customer legally owns Tiger.  If I can't get the disc to work, I'm probably going to try to have a friend torrent it for me.  I'd love to find a better solution.

I am in the need of replacing both my desktop and laptop and I was thinking a MacBook Air could do both.

What are your experiences or recommendations for such setup? Can you just use your MBA while it's closed shut ?

However, I am extremely frustrated with using iTunes. iTunes was one of the main reasons I had stopped using iPods back in the day and now I am hating it again with the iPhone.

Here are my main problems that I am hoping you guys can help me with:

1. I would like music from my Windows Music Library to be automatically added to iTunes when I download it to that folder. I am aware that the easiest way to do this is to download/put music in the ""Add Automatically to iTunes"" folder within the iTunes folder. HOWEVER, I cannot do this as I need all my music to stay in its current folder so that my torrent trackers remain correct (it is a massive pain to update all of them for 180gigs of music).

2. My Smart Playlists don't sync to my phone even when they are shown in iTunes. For example, I made the Smart Playlist ""New Music"" to contain all music I have added in the past 5 days. In iTunes library I can see the three albums I have downloaded in the past 5 days. I then go to iPhone in iTunes and set that folder to sync. I can see the playlist ""New Music"" on my iPhone but it is empty.

3. I am unable to sync with by wi-fi. My phone will be plugged into the wall in the same room as my computer and router and the error message I get is: ""iTunes cannot sync apps to the iPhone '______'s iPhone' because the apps installed on the iPhone could not be determined."" Additionally, multiple times when connecting my phone to my computer by USB, I get the message: ""The iPhone '_______'s iPhone' could not be synced because the connection to the iPhone was lost."" When I check my Windows explorer it shows that the iPhone is connected and visible. Normally I need to restart iTunes in order for it to recognize my phone.

I kind of thought I'd just been ignoring it before and only noticing it recently, but it took me about 15 minutes of force quitting and restarting just to get safari or firefox open enough to post this (safari worked in the end).

I have been keeping an eye on the activity manager for a while as well, and configd is usually around 103% when it freezes, which kind of doesn't sound that great to me. A quick look online says it does stuff to do with drives, so I can't really quit it, but is there any way to limit it? Also, when things start freezing, the fans go crazy and stuff - I thought it was heat problems for a while so I used it only on tables while raised so there was a good air flow - no difference, and the mac doesn't feel that warm until *after* the fans have been going a while.

My macbook has a 2.3GHz processor, 4GB memory and it's running OS X 10.6.8 (I don't have reliable internet to update regularly so I'm behind, and I don't have money to get new OS Xs). It also has a Windows partition through bootcamp. I don't really run that many apps on it, and I don't think I installed any new ones or updated around the time it started freezing. I don't use Time Machine or anything else like that (I backup manually to my harddrive and cloud).

I'm not that technical a person, but if anyone could tell me what to do, I'd be super grateful.

I took em and was texting friends while working on this, and didn't think once to screenshot this stuff. 
I have an Early 2011 Macbook Pro, with an upgraded disk, and ram. I opted for the [Seagate Momentus Hybrid Drive](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1505940&amp;SRCCODE=WEBGOOPA&amp;cm_mmc_o=mH4CjC7BBTkwCjCV1-CjCE&amp;gclid=CIu0_MbMnbMCFWGnPAodg0wAQQ)

Anyway, I began noticing that I had ""very little"" disk space left. I was down to about 90gb left, which is a little concerning to me because I do projects all the time with video and audio, and what have you. So, optimizing my disk usage is key. (I have back up drives and other storage drives, as well.) This is my main, portable machine, so I take things with me to go. (obviously).

I got to to looking and realized that I had a huge ""Other Section."" I downloaded Daisydisk, and began to investigate.Upon investigation, I realized I had 3+ year old iPhone backups. So those went, and I began to weed out the old backups, that I no longer needed. Upto 6 months ago. That freed up a great amount of space. I rebooted and looked back at my disk usage with the ""About This Mac"" tool. Prognosis: Surprised. All that free space soon became ""Back Ups.""

Enter ""Pissed Mode."" I began looking at it, and searching around a bit. Turns out, that free space soon became home to Snapshots from Time Capsule. I disabled Time Machine and stopped it from backing up wirelessly to Time Capsule. Reboot. Reset PRAM for good measure. 

Back to ""About This Mac"" Seems to have done the trick. Reluctantly, I enable Time Machine again. Reboot one last time. Phew. Back ups are a minimal level now, and I've got over 315gb of free space!

Hopefully this helps someone!

2. I can't seem to invoke the netboot option when there is a firmware password.  Does anybody know how to do that?

I do apologies I'm not an Apple guy (yet), mainly Windows Server. I work for a school and we've just purchased 30 iMacs and a Mac Pro Server. We also got in an apple consultant who helped setup and image the clients.

Initially I wanted our students to be able to login to the iMacs using their Active Directory credentials. I know this was possible because I've read about it and it's commonly done. Unfortunately we don't have much space on our Windows servers to give our users any more then 300MB so we purchased 8TB's of internal storage for the Mac Server.

Now the consultant said I can't authenticate using AD and have a home drive mapped to the Mac Server. It has to be mapped to the AD home folder. We can't do this because the music projects are going to get very large, very quickly. He said he can export the users from AD and import the CSV onto the Mac Server. However... I went back 5 hours later and he'd typed in manually 400 students because the import didn't work!

Now he's gone, we're left with a system that we now have to manage separately to our Windows network with over 1600 students. 

I'm not looking forward to Tuesday when the kids come back from their Easter Holidays.

Now I've tried Google'ing the problem but its hard to get the results im looking for because it assumes I want to map the Windows home directory and I don't want that.

I'd really appreciate any help and advice on how I go about doing this. I'm about to read this PDF (http://www.afp548.com/netboot/mactips/activedir.html) to get a better understanding but I doubt it covers my situation.

It was my little sisters phone and it was stolen out of her locker so it was probably a 12 year old boy or girl.

We have a few ideas of who it might be, but it is based on who my little sister thinks it is.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

**Edit** The phone was recovered!!  We contacted the school and one of the administrators did some detective work and found numerous witnesses.  We used find my iPhone and stated that we knew where the person was and to email us so we could get the phone back.  The girl who stole it was 12 so she freaked out and gave the phone to a guy who later became freaked out because we knew where he was too.  He eventually admitted to getting our messages and ditching the phone.

The admin went to the park where it was located on gps and looked for it but the kid did not find it.  He told the parents and the parents took the kids back which is when the kid admitted to it and retrieved the phone.

There was no damage either we are pretty amazed that this worked out so well.

I've had the computer for about three weeks, and today I decided to start up World of Warcraft. Immediately I noticed my power icon, while plugged in, switched to saying ""Not Charging"" when I was logged into WoW. I tried to figure out what was going on, and eventually called AppleCare.  They weren't able to help me, and directed me to the Apple Store, who basically told me there was nothing they could do about it.

What appears to be happening, for some strange reason, is that running WoW uses more power than the power adapter can handle (85w adapter). Therefore, the system runs off both the power adapter *and* the battery. According to coconutBattery, the battery usage is fairly small- currently sitting between 4-6 watts and has drained about 6% of the battery in the last hour(ish).

I'm rather disappointed that what is otherwise an amazing machine can't seem to do something as simple as regulating power usage for a video game. I love my macs, and generally think they do an exceptional job- but if this is indeed an engineering issue, and there is nothing I can do about it, that is extremely disheartening.  Especially considering the rather absurd amount of money I payed for the machine, and all the months I saved up to be able to afford it.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for in posting this, except to maybe share with some folks.

I have read a couple of posts already on this subject, but I wanted to specifically tune a post towards my situation.


I'm a new support tech for a large hospital/university campus.  My boss recently suggested/requested that I work on getting Apple certified as we are an Apple authorized service center.  My questions revolved around how much certification I should bother with, and the best way to get said certification and have the training be as relevant as possible.


From what I understand, there are three certifications my boss thinks I need to get.  The general Apple OS support cert, the desktop cert, and the portable device cert.  Is this true?  Mind you the company is paying for this training and testing.  Also, most of the Macs use Snow Leopard, and I assume the current certification uses Lion.  What can I do to learn to support Snow Leopard as well?


I'll have access to the GSX website and all the training material there.  Is this material alone easy enough and thorough enough to follow and pass the test on a first try?  If not, I've seen a lot of recommendations  for the peachpit books, and some have suggested the 5 day training courses to me.  Any feedback on those?  Which peachpit books are worth it, which are not?


Any advice on this topic, even if I didn't ask specifically would be appreciated.


TLDR - New tech, need service technician cert, company pays for training and PASSED test, what should I use to prepare.

I've found lots of good stuff, and a fair bit of bad stuff too. I'm putting a lot of the bad stuff down to the fact that generally, when people buy good stuff, they don't crow about it on the internets as much as when it doesn't work. 

Anyway. Do you have a Mid 2010 MBP? Did you get an aftermarket 512GB SSD? Does the thing work like a dream, or does it cause you untold pain? (First world problem I know..)

**EDIT 1** I spoke to a Crucial rep today on instant chat. They informed me that there is a 3 year warranty on it, plus a 45 day no quibble guarantee if I'm not happy for some reason. 

The drive price had dropped Â£20 since the start of the week, and Quidco (a money back/coupon type site that I have used in the past) had an offer of 15% cash back if you click though their link so I pulled the trigger on the 512GB SSD I linked to.

We'll see if it lives up the expectations! :D

**EDIT 2** OK. I had some installation woes. I ordered it with the SATA to USB cable expecting a quick disk clone. Nope! First I had to update the Firmware (from 009 to 0309!!!) but you have to download the ISO from their site, burn the ISO and boot from it. Of course it won't see the drive when it is attached with the SATA to USB adapter. When I placed it inside my MBP, it saw and updated it fine. 

Clone. The Software must be installed on your Mac then run on the desktop. The copy on the CD crashed on loading every time with Lion. I downloaded the latest copy. This worked and started the process (note: no fucking instructions on how to do this from Crucial, only a small Quick start guide saying: run the software....) Thanks guys. The data was transferring at about 20mb/s and I couldn't be bothered waiting so....

I swapped the drives out. Updated the firmware (as above) then booted from the old HDD connected with the SATA to USB cable into Lion recovery mode, then restored to the SSD from a TimeMachine backup. Took about 3 hours. 

Soooooo... loading. Fuck a duck. I use Filevault so it comes up with the chime and logo then prompts for my credentials. HDD time to desktop was 1 min 20 seconds. SDD time from hitting enter after my password is.. about 3 seconds. Everything loaded in 5. I shit you not. No fresh build remember.. all my apps and settings intact (including who knows how much junk, although I try to keep it tidy!). Opened all the apps I could, they come straight up. No bouncing. 

SATA 2 as discussed: Black magic is showing about 285 or so on both read or write confirming my thoughts about the bus limiting the read speed. Don't care, it's fast!!

* No internet, no keyboard, and no audio (\~30%)

Each of these problems are resolved by rebooting, at which point, the setup works great.

If i store a e-mail message as a draft, they wont appear in the default Drafts box.. but again, IMAP will create another box for it.

I can't find good software very easy and when I do, it's really expensive. I don't like piracy and on Windows I mostly use open source software which is very good. 

What I like about the Mac is it has some mindblowing features, but I can barely find them because I'm not used to them. For a noob, it seems just great, because I'm sure he would learn to use it much easier than Windows, but for me, after learning each and every Windows feature and shortcut it's pretty hard to change habbits.

When I boot into Windows and look through my OSX file system, everything seems alright at a glance, except /Users/myname, which has nothing in it except what right-click-&gt;Properties in Windows calls a 'File', has no name and is 0 bytes in size.

My last computer was a 2008 15"" MacBook Pro, so it was a HUGE improvement. This new imac stayed at work. (I'm a web designer.)

Anyway, Friday, a client was standing up from my desk, and his elbow caught the edge of my imac, and it landed flat on the desk, right on the front glass. 

Luckily, it didn't affect the display at all, it's still perfectly usable, but it looks BAD. It cracked only the glass near the top beziel, the black part, at the top. The FaceTime camera is blurred from the crack, but other than that there is no other damage.  It has to stay on my desk for client meetings, so just 'dealing with it' isn't an option. 

So, what are my options? I can buy AppleCare, since it's only a few days old, and my warranty is of course still active. I'm hoping they can give me some leniency on the repair costs. I just dropped $1,670 on the imac, I can't afford another $800 on a refurb thunderbolt. :/ (if anybody has one they want to sell for cheaper, I'm interested!)


One particularly interesting thing was that the AppleCare technician couldn't even get a code for the part. It was the first one that he'd seen cracked. Maybe I could convince them that they should cover it, since it technically wasn't me that broke it, it was an everyday work hazard?

I've decided that I'm taking it into the AASP today at lunch.

I'm want to setup a mac I have in another country (where I'm originally from), and be able to access the files in it with my laptop in the US. 
I can use teamviewer to manage the mac and if I need to mess up with the router my dad can help on the other end, but I don't know what steps to follow. I don't think I want FTP, since it's not encrypted, so I guess I can try to setup a VPN or an SFTP, but I don't know how to start. I've been reading a lot about it on google, but couldn't find specific steps. People just say use Filezilla or something, but I think for that I need to create an account to have a host. I want this to be free. The reason is that, my mac in Peru has 2 TB, and my laptop has barely enough, so I want to have my backups and documents on the server.

The mac I have is a mac mini with mountain lion. Let me know if you need more information. Thank you for you help!

ps: I created an account in no-ip, so i can fix the issue of dynamic IP in the mac. I'm reviewing how to set it up now.

EDIT: This is what I have done so far:

On the Mac Mini
1) Activated sftp and ftp, and tested them using the terminal.
2) Used UPnP port mapper for port forwarding. I'm assigned some port (21, 990, and 3000-400 as I saw on an tutorial)
2) Created an account with No-IP, and set it up. So even if my public IP changes, I have a host name.

On ubuntu
1) Downloaded Filezilla and I'm trying to reach the mac, but it is not working.

Edit2: [Solved]

Alright so steps: 1) create a no-ip account for dynamic dns.
2) make internal ip static

4) Activated sftp on mac (check remote login) and enter command on terminal:
sudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist

5) check that port 22 is reachable, check hostname, and open a ftp client on client computer to test.

1369978754.0,9,self.applehelp,1fe09t,Here's a challenge for you guys - I'm at wits end. My MBP won't boot from the hard drive.,electric_dolphin,9,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/1fe09t/heres_a_challenge_for_you_guys_im_at_wits_end_my/,"Here we go. I have a Mid-2010 MacBook Pro (identifier 7,1 / model A1278). It started having a problem where, upon boot up, it would get stuck at the grey/white Apple screen with the spinning cog beneath the Apple logo. Here's what I've tried so far and has not fixed the problem:

(PS: I have successfully made a full backup image of the HD in Disk Utility so losing data is not a concern.)

- Reset PRAM
- Reset SMC
- Tried to boot from safe mode by holding the shift key at startup (immediately after the chime). It gives me the loading bar, gets about a third of the way, then just goes to the spinning cog/Apple logo screen and gets stuck again.

So then I booted the computer from a Mountain Lion image on a partition of my external hard drive, and tried the following:

- Went into Disk Utility, and ran a permissions fix, which fixed a few things then it was fine. When I ran ""verify disk"" on the drive it resulted in no errors. Then when I ran ""repair disk"" (just for the hell of it) I got the error: ""Partition map repair failed while adjusting structures to fit current whole disk size.""
- Tried to just erase the drive. Error: ""Disk Erase failed with the error: Couldn't unmount disk.""
- Tried to format the drive from the Partition tab. I got the same error.
- Tried to just re-install Mountain Lion, still using the image on my external HD that I'm booted from. I immediately got the error: ""An error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again.""

Tried to boot up from a physical CD of Snow Leopard, in case it was a problem with Mountain Lion's disk utility and installer. Nope. Kernel Panic every time.

I have a hard drive docking station, so next I hooked up the new HD from my MacBook Air (which is working normally) and used Disk Utility to erase/format the drive just fine, and install Mountain Lion onto it. Worked great. When I installed the hard drive back into the MacBook Pro, it still won't boot from it.

Other things I've tried:

- Booted up from an image of TechTool Pro 6.0.3 and ran all the tests- it did not find any problems with the memory, graphics, or hard drive.
- Booted up from an image of DiskWarrior 4.4, it found no problems.

I am able to boot the computer from an Ubuntu disc, version 12.04 LTS. I can run Ubuntu and try to format the drive as Apple Partition Map and Master Boot Record, and it gives the error: Error creating partition table: helper exited with exit code 1: Error calling fsync(2) on dev/sda: Input/output error.

I have no idea what else to try. I at least what to figure out what's wrong with this thing. It's not under warranty. I have burned GParted and PMagic discs which I've heard can do some cool things but I'm not sure how to use them.

Anyone have any ideas?

Yesterday, I turned on my iPad and it looked like this:

http://imgur.com/GlGwFhq

The screen was grainy and there was a lot of purple and green and it was flickering a little.  I did a factory restore and it didn't work.  I made an appointment with the apple store and when I got out of my car at the mall, my iPad was working again.  No problems at all.  So I considered myself lucky and cancelled the appointment.

Then last night it suddenly did this:

http://imgur.com/7BwmEIZ

Basically a black screen with white moving across.  So I made another appointment last night for today.  The guy at the apple store told me that the warranty expired yesterday and there was nothing he could do for me.  If I want to trade it in and get a new one, it'll be $249.

First, I just want a working iPad.  So if you know how I can fix it, let me know.

Second, if it's not an easy fix, where can I turn?  Can I appeal this decision or email someone that can help me.  It seems like bad form to make devices that break the day the warranty expires and really it broke yesterday anyway.  I just want to do whatever I can to get my iPad fixed without paying a lot of money and hopefully you can help.

edit: I have another appointment in an hour. I have the email for the appointment yesterday and I will try to speak to a manager if the genius doesn't comply.  I'm not a rude person anyway, but I'll be on my best behavior.  I guess we'll see what happens.  Thanks for the help.  I'll let you know.

When viewed from straight on, the patches are white and make it very difficult to view any sort of image.  If you look at the screen from an angle (especially from the top) they appear to be a shade of orange.

-It is not dead pixels
-It has not been dropped sustained any sort of impact/water damage.
-It's annoying.

1) Do I spent the extra money on the [OWC Data Doubler Kit](http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other+World+Computing/DDAMBS0GB/) or should I just buy a [cheaper bracket] (http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Unibody-MacBook-SuperDrive-Replacement/dp/B0058AH2US/ref=pd_cp_pc_0) on amazon and follow some youtube instructions.  If the latter, can you point me to the best set of instructions for replacing the optical drive with an SSD?

However, can anyone be more specific here as to how they exactly set this up? Is the home folder still located on the SSD but with symbolic links linking back to HDD?

It went on the **left** side of the keyboard and fan. 

In the time it took for me to rush to the next room to retrieve some wet wipes I presume a small amount seeped through the keyboard and fan. I say small because the noodle-juice is slightly less runny than your average water or coffee spill. 

Anyway, the noodle-juice dried quick, one good thing about it. I powered off immediately and removed the MagSafe adaptor, as instinct. I wiped the laptop over and tried to remove any residue.

So when it was clean on top I powered on. Still working. But I noticed it was running slow. I only have a 128gb drive and 2 gig of RAM, but it usually ran pretty fast for a laptop crammed full of films and files. To give perspective, it ran faster than my friend's brand new 8 gig ram Windows laptop.

It could barely do a non-strenuous task such as use Chrome. That night every time it went super-slow I would restart and it would be running OK. This happened 4 days ago. It can run Chrome fine, not great though. It is alright at browsing mainly text websites such as reddit, but it is impossible to watch a flash video throughout.

I also cannot watch videos on VLC player at all without the computer going into a lagg-o-spasm. Music makes the computer more prone to super slow mode and videos are a no-go.

The laptop is prone to random flashes on the screen if it hasn't been used for a while (Like random blocks of black-static-stuff, like you see in movies when people's computers are being hacked). I am a hardware noobie but perhaps the noodle got on the graphics card? Would that cause this?

I intend to go visit the Apple retailer near me, they're quite helpful with this sort of thing I think because they're a licensed retailer, not an Apple store. 

Please help, and also give and estimate on how much it would cost to repair, and whether I should consider a new laptop. Greatly appreciated.

lately my MacBook Pro has been really sluggish.
At first, i thought it was chrome since it seemed to be most affected, but after using Safari for a while the same problem happens there.

Text sporadically lags in textboxes, F3'ing (showing all windows), clicking in system preferences etc., is all laggy.

And I say laggy, because it doesn't really seem SLOW, it just.. lags.
F.ex, Photoshop starts in a couple of seconds from a cold boot, but at the same time, other applications might have this lag i'm talking about.

I formatted and re-installed (10.8.3), but still no improvement(!).

So... can it be my SSD drive? i ran one of those scan app's, but it said the disc was healthy.
RAM? is there a way to check that?

Please help :/

I'm very familiar with troubleshooting issues on PC and have some exposure to Macs, but not a whole lot.

I use a MBP as my home computer, but I never have problems and certainly not the type of problems I see in a typical corporate setting. The person we had primarily supporting the Macs left the company and I see this as an opportunity to step up and learn to support Macs as well as I do PC's. Anything more than the most basic problems requires me to research the issue (aka Google) which isn't a bad thing, but I would really like to become more proficient in basic troubleshooting. There will always be issues that are deeper than just the basics, as with troubleshooting PC's.

Luckily my boss and company are pretty supportive. They have budget for training set aside for the year. Are there any books that are recommended? I was looking at Peach Pit Press and also O'Reilly. I was also considering taking theApple Certified Macintosh Technician (ACMT) Certification course. Anyone have any experience with that (good or bad comments welcome).

tldr; Job has an opportunity for me to step up and start supporting Macs. Need recommendations on any books, online resources or certification classes that would help get me ramped up quickly

I've had a MacBook Pro for about 18 months and have loved it. However, after about six months of use, the charger failed, and I had to get a new one. I wasn't sure what could have gone wrong, as the MacBook sits on my desk and is rarely moved, but I didn't think much of it and got a replacement. 

A few months later, the same thing happened, and I had to get another replacement charger off of Ebay (brand new/in packaging). Cut to this week, and I've run into the problem for the third time--another unresponsive charger. With this latest charger, my paranoia level was so high that I took incredible care not to ever tweak, bend or otherwise damage the device, (not that I ever mistreated the previous two) and yet it still broke. I chalked the first two up to freak occurrences, but at this point there's obviously something going on. 

Thinking this must be some kind of overheating or electrical issue, I took my MacBook to an Apple store today, and after spending some time with the device, the person helping me came back and pointed out about a 1x1 cm area that evidently had water damage as indicated by the discoloration. He noted that the damage, although small, was on the logic board and that it would cost $750 to replace. I...can't really afford to eat $750 at the moment, and I'm wondering if I have any alternatives. $750 seems exorbitant considering the prices of piecemeal computer components. On top of that, as I said earlier, the MacBook is treated with great care and very rarely moved, so I'm a little worried about dropping $750 to fix something that seemingly crept up out of nowhere despite the amount of care I took in handling the device.   

Anyone else run into issues like this? Am I really facing a $750 charge? For that price and the money I've put into chargers, I could have just purchased a brand new PC for that price.

I think there's something wrong with my macbook,acornty,12,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/17efpl/losing_50_gigs_worth_of_hard_drive_space_within/,"A very strange thing has started happening to my macbook pro retina lately. I had somewhere around 110 gigs of free space on my HD, then after a few days, I'm down to 60 gigs of free space. To get to the bottom of this I downloaded JDiskReport and scanned my HD. What I found confuses the hell out of me. For some reason, under /Volumes, there is a folder that takes up about 60 gigs of space. It's labeled as MobileBackups. Now, you'd think it'd be as simple as navigating to /Volumes and deleting this folder right? Wrong. It doesn't exist, yet the space is still being taken up. I've tried turning on hidden files, but it's not there. Another strange thing I noticed was that when I click more info under ""about my mac"" and go to the storage tab, it says there are around 70 gigs of space that have been taken up by backups. This is strange because I always backup to my external HD, never my internal. Could these 70 gigs be related to the MobileBackups folder?

We sent each other a lot of text messages during the trip but I was careful to try to only use iMessage whenever possible to avoid racking up massive international text message fees. As I had turned data roaming off, this meant that I tried to stay connected to WiFi as much as possible.

But I noticed that a lot of the messages I was receiving from my wife were arriving as text messages, not as iMessages, even though I thought I was connected to WiFi. 

What was happening was that my iPhone was turning WiFi off when it went to sleep. Normally this isn't a problem as it can just rely on the data network to receive any messages. But when I am roaming this either means that the message is received as a text message, or if data roaming is turned on, it comes in as an iMessage but huge fees can build up due to the insane international roaming fees. 

As hard as I looked, I couldn't find a way to keep WiFi on during sleep. 

It was also a problem with Face Time. If my phone was asleep and my wife tried to call, it would just get rejected because WiFi was turned off and it was not connected to the cellular network.

I am not posting this to bitch about Apple or iPhones or anything, but more of a cautionary tale for when you travel abroad. You may think you are connected to WiFi, but you may not be and you could be incurring charges you were unaware of.
