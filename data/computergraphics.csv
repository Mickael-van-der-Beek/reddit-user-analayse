Both as a refresher for the android platform and as a tool for artists to display their portfolio on the go at interviews, conventions, or anywhere else.

The current features supported are:

* OBJ models (triangulated or quad based works best
* Up to 3 lights (1 in the free version, 3 in the pro version)
* Normal mapping
* Fresnel based Specular (alpha channel is used for roughness currently)
* Emissive textures in pro version
* Wireframe overlay
* Full bright texture display
* Live wallpaper
* Multiple object scenes
* Gallery mode in the pro version

Some of my future plans currently include:

* Replace the colour picker
* Shadows
* Image based lighting
* Glossy reflections
* Velocity based camera (swipe and the camera slowly comes to a stop essentially).

There's still some edge case bugs with loading that need to be resolved still so feedback is welcome.

Yesterday I wanted to create a normal map for a very low poly object and wanted to keep some edges hard. After trying to use the crease border tool I couldn't get the result I wanted; I googled a bit for a better solution and found that after using the crease tool in Maya and GoZ it should keep the edges as I wanted them. The result was still not very good, the edges still deformed a bit when subdividing.
After that failure, I decided to try Mudbox, and after fiddling with it and watching some tutorials, all the functions I wanted and needed were there and seemed easy to use, the interface was well organised and much more intuitive (probably because I'm used to Maya), moving the camera instead of the object was more pleasant, and overall it seems like a great easy to use sculpting software.


That made me wonder why we don't hear much about it. Every time I see something sculpted in 3D, read about the movie and games industry pipeline Zbrush is mentioned, but very rarely Mudbox.


I find Zbrush extremely hard to use, and I was thinking about dropping it for Mudbox; this could be a problem if I eventually get a job in this line of work as I would be expected to use Zbrush.

Why is Mudbox so underrepresented, and would it be a bad idea to focus and invest on it?


Edit:
Thank you very much for all your comments, you were really helpful! For now I'll stick with Mudbox to get more comfortable with sculpting as I need more practice, and try Zbrush again once I feel ready to expand my knowledge.",,False,self,t5_2qhxp,1368023040.0,,,True,t3_1dvh0e,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/1dvh0e/zbrush_vs_mudbox/,

I only had 1 and 1/2 days to finish it, so I used a couple of pre-sculpted assets that they liked from my portfolio.

I did a new sculpt and added the elements to match yesterday, then today I re-topoed, baked, then textured and finished this afternoon. Probably about 6 hours or so of work.

Shoot 720p (or VGA) videos and capture 3-axis camera rotation and acceleration with your iPhone.

Axis3D® is simply a great tool to create camera tracking backdrops for your favorite 3D or 2D application. As you shoot your videos, Axis3D records the camera rotation and acceleration movements and store all data on industry level compatible files. You can then import everything on your favorite 3D or 2D animation software like Maya, 3DS Max, LightWave, SoftImage, Blender, Cinema4D, After Effects or any 3D or 2D app that can read Collada 1.4 files with camera geometry and create professional amazing animations.

You can use Axis3D to simulate real life situations like walking, earthquakes, camera or ground trepidation, bike or vehicles accelerations and use this to animate your 3D models or other objects making them behave like the real deal.

*Files created by Axis3D are compatible with industry level animation software like Audodek Maya® 2011, Audodek 3DS Max® 11, Audodek Softimage 2011, Newtek Lightwave 9.6+, Blender 2.4x, Maxon Cinema 4D® v.11, Adobe After Effects® CS5* and any other application that can read Collada files with camera geometry or Maya ASCII files.*

**I will drop a note here on reddit when it is available. You can also send your email to *i-p-h-o-n-e---at---a-d-d-f-o-n-e.com* (remove the -), if you want want to receive the announcement on your email.**

I’m a graduate student at SCAD studying Animation.  I am beginning work on my masters thesis this quarter and I wanted to include you all in my research because I am developing tools and methods primarily for people like you!

My thesis is centered around the collaborative effort of talented people such as yourselves to produce an animated short film or game.

**I intend to research and develop tool-sets and methodologies to aid a group of people to collaborate over the internet to establish a decentralized studio capable of taking a script or idea and seeing it through to completion.**

I will be sharing my findings and research with all the communities I frequent, and I feel would benefit from.

EDIT: *This will be open platform, non proprietary tools, and freely distributed research/information.*

The reason I’m posting here is to seek your opinions and gauge your interest.

I have a few very simple questions that would aid me greatly in the development of my thesis.  I’d love it if you could answer them and ask any questions you have for me!

* 1) Would you be interested in collaborating with people over the internet on larger projects?

* 2) Do you currently have experience coordinating, communicating, and working with a production pipeline or similar workflow?

* 3) Would you like to learn?

* 4) Are you a: Hobbyist, Student,  Independant Film Maker, or Professional?

* 5) Which artistic school would you closely identify with? Concept/Previs, Model/Texture, Rigging, Animation, Lighting, VSFX, Compositing / Post-Production?  (Or Other)

I also I developed a [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13A9Tfg49kXFVmEv4LiaiopRe4LCwMhgl8w8QO0mmbx8/viewform) intended for people currently in the industry, working at a studio.  It just contains some simple questions regarding telecommuting.  It should take 10 minutes to fill out, tops... If you’re bored, you have a job in the industry, and want to help further I'd appreciate 10 minutes of your day. :)



Thanks again for any information or discussion that results from this.  Crowd sourcing opinions and discussion is (unfortunately) one of my primary research methods!

I created it to give people ideas and challenges to model for practice and to learn new methods.

I am trying to keep it very open so each daily and weekly challenge can be completed by users of any skill level, using any software of their choice.

If you have any questions or suggestions please post them in the suggestion thread or message any of the mods.

The theme was ""an alien wizard seduced my mom,"" and it was super fun. I'd love to do one weekly on Reddit, anyone else fancy the idea?

EDIT: More thoughts on how it would be handled. 

1. 90 minute timeline. Starting pistol time (say, Thursday at 10 PM Eastern, 7 PM Pacific?)
2. You meet/break the time based off of an image post with a time stamp
3. All the entries get Edit-pinned to the OP's post
4. The OP post at 10 PM/7PM includes the iron chef theme
5. Pure upvotes decides the winner...? Arguably prone to vote rigging, but since this would be for fun/practice with no real prize, I don't think it'll get broken.

Lastly, one of the dudes from my anecdote posted his entry on Blendswap. You can go check out his alien wizard seducer here: http://www.blendswap.com/3D-models/characters/alien-wizard-seduced-my-mom/

The job pays 41k, and is based in the middle of Texas. Not Austin either... a little north of austin. 

Any who, if you have 3 years exp in the industry (doing anything, you could have been the janitor at an indie game studio, modded some games, sold some hats on TF2...) and are interested in moving to the heart of texas without being compensated for relocation, then I have the perfect job for you!

Honestly if you are single and don't like to go out much, the job is great. Big discount for renting a house on campus (cheaper than apt in the area, and bigger)

Position would start in 2 weeks, you would work adjunct (part time) for 7 weeks, making about 20k. Then in april you would be hired on full time. Once you go full time you get full benefits, though there is not much in the way of salary increase. You might be able to talk them into 42 a year if you have a bachelors degree though.

Now, I have 3 computers and a laptop which I wanted to leverage for a render farm of sorts.  I didn't like any of the commercial offerings so, I wrote a program that I'm calling SRM for Simple Render Manager.

I'm a Maya animator, so I designed it to work for Maya.  But, I'd also like it to support any command-line renderer.  That's where I need beta testers.  I could use feedback on the documentation, (is it understandable?) and I'd like to be able to supply configuration files for Max, XSI, Softimage, etc.  but I don't work with those packages, so I need some help there.

I am about to start my junior year in engineering at Purdue University studying electrical engineering. I took a C.A.D class my third semester and really enjoyed creating (even though I was just creating machine parts which was not too awesome) things using CATIA and Autodesk Inventor. Can honestly say this is the only class I've really liked in college so far. My personal past time is working on Photoshop and creating all kinds of fantasy manipulations while reading tutorials ( My deviantart page containing some of my work if interested : http://avngr86.deviantart.com/ ). That being said, I have been thinking about going into computer graphics technology ever since my second semester in college and since I am now seeing more of actual engineering classes past my core classes, I don't think I wanna do this any more. I've talked to an advisor about switching in to the Computer graphics tech department but I just need to know if this is for me. **Maybe you guys can give me your insight as to why you started working in computer graphics, what kind of work you are doing now, if the interests i have mentioned are some of yours as well and (to justify this change to my parents) what kind of job placement there is for the CGT field?**

I attended RPI (Troy, NY), and finished with a B.S. in Architectural Building Sciences.  While I was there, I fell in love with 3d modeling, and decided that I would do whatever it took to get into a job involving it.  I took all of the animation courses they offered, even acting as TA for some, and now have a solid understanding of Maya.  Upon graduation, however, I found that there were simply no jobs for me.  Studios (both animation- and games-based) wanted X years experience, solid knowledge of specific software prior to starting, etc.  Some even flat-out told me that they only hire via college outreach programs, and that if I wanted to work there, I'd have to no only return to college, but to one of a specific set that they work with.

Its been 2 years and 3 months since I graduated, and since then I've lived in varying levels of poverty while trying to improve my abilities, build a portfolio, and get a job.  I'm currently a dishwasher, and even finding a better crap job seems impossible as of late (I watch as friends that are graduating from RPI now can't even get a job at a deli, and it's very sad).  At the worst, I couldn't afford food and lost a quarter of my weight, though now I can at least live slightly comfortably.  I just want to get out of this, and do professionally what I've come to enjoy so much.

I'm months from starting at the Art Institute's Boston campus, The New England Institute of Art.  Now people are telling me its a scam, and that I'll be buried in debt with nothing to show for it.  They say I need to find a niche on an online 3d community, and build online relationships that could get me jobs.  I've tried that on several sites, and it got me nowhere.  Meanwhile, my job takes so much time from me that I can barely find any to actually work on my art... but if I stop working, I'll be bankrupt very quickly.

I just want some solid ideas here.  I don't mind taking the time to earn another degree, but I need to make sure it will put me in a place where I can find a job.  I'm in the upstate NY area, and would prefer to stay in the region, if only because of costs of moving too far.  The Boston/Mass. area seems like a good place to be for the type of education/jobs I want, but I'm unsure.

**TL;DR** Have architecture degree.  Poor.  Have drive, talent, and love of 3d modeling.  Stuck in the upstate NY region.  Ideas?  (Thanks very much in advance for any help.)

**EDIT:** I'd link my portfolio, but I've been trying to update the site recently, and until it's more finished I'd rather not show it.  My most recent 3d project can be found on my DA, here: http://smudgedcat.deviantart.com/

I am looking to buy a new low end computer to watch stuff or surf around on a pretty tesious commute, I also want to look into upgrading from my old wacom bamboo that is slowly going bonkers.

I was thinking maybe one could do both by buying a fancy tablet computer and a compatible stylus pen.

Does anyone have experience with actively using a tablet for drawing concepts and/or sketching stuff out?

I am googling around like mad looking at reviews and such but considering its the first time im even looking at tablets it's pretty hard to get a good grasp on what to look at, so anyone with first-hand experience, please share.

My main concerns are:

* Pressure sensitivity, does it work on tablet computers?

* Hardware compatibility. I mean, does it even work at all?

* Software availability. Can I use photoshop or do I need platform specific stuff?

* Neat extra features? Could I, for example, plug it in as a drawing tablet with secondary screen inside to my desktop? As a cintiq alternative?

I got a job at a super market and used that money to buy myself a nice canon DSLR as well as a decent workstation. I worked day and night creating stuff and I loved it. I graduated and from some recommendations I chose to attend Ai in NYC for it's film program because I felt eh what the hell I'll learn 3d on the side. 


That was the worst decision of my life. Basically in a nutshell I spent countless hours of no sleep, doing shitty projects, over-worked, stressed, teachers that couldn't give a fuck, at some points I was teaching the teacher, and I was surrounded by students who cared more about their precious weed then they did about anything else. I guess film isn't for me. By the third quarter I couldn't take it anymore and so I transferred to SVA. 



The thing is though, I feel so tired all the time now. My sleep schedule is fucked up and I honestly don't feel like doing this anymore.  I like SVA, but I have no motivation to go to class. I get on the computer to try and do some 3d, but I just can't for some reason. My friends tell me I'm burnt out, but how do you over come that?

experience and texture size! Go!",Eagleshadow,13,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/qnhnj/texture_painting_your_workflow_experience_and/,"I'm trying to become much better at texture painting, so right now I'm working on a game character model trying to figure out the best way to texture it as professionally as possible.

I never had any training in it, I did go through various tutorials and such, but I'm still trying to find the most efficient workflow. Few years ago I started off trying to figure out if I can efficiently use the new 3D painting feature in Photoshop CS4, I found it very counter intuitive and hard to work with so I quickly decided to search for a better product and ended up using Maxon Bodypaint. It was pretty good for the time being but when I discovered 3D Coat, I figured I like it even better. I used 3D Coat for a long time to make various textures, although none were too complicated or professional-looking. I also tried painting in Mudbox. I liked some of its features but I went back to 3D coat soon enough becasue it gave me more precision when aligning up images for projection painting.

For some reason I just can't get wacom pressure sensitivity to work correctly in 3D Coat, and I figured I can't do complex stuff with enough precision and efficiency. I went on to try Mari, at first I was very excited about it but then I got disappointed when i realized how badly it supports overlaying UVs, and considering most game models have mirrored UVs, I quickly gave up on using it for game model texturing.

So few weeks ago I tried what was a new approach for me, using Photoshop on the right side of the screen to paint the texture in 2D, while keeping 3Ds Max on the left side of the screen and have it auto update the texture every time i ctr+s in photoshop. I find that working like this is acceptable since it gives the best painting tools available (photoshop) and the artist doesn't have to guess too much about how the texture will look, since it can be previewed in a matter of seconds. It's certainly a step below 3D texturing applications when it comes to convenience or trying to figure out where exactly something in 3D model will be in the 2D space, it often takes some guessing to make stuff line up correctly.

I'm working on a moba style character texture, so think 512x512 px. (same resolution Riot uses for LoL champions textures) So I'm actually working on 512x512 canvas, and I find it a good way to limit myself from going into unnecessary details if I were to be using a larger 1 or 2k texture that I intended to downscale later. The problem is that [wireframe overlay is often very unclear](http://i.imgur.com/OgTf2.png) so it's hard to figure out what's going on and next-to-impossible to paint while having it turned on. And just one last thing to add: I never tried Zbrush texture painting, I know some people are using it but I don't really know much about it, I just somehow haven't got around to trying it.

Here is some of texture work that I did over time using different applications:

* Maxon Bodypaint
 * [texture](http://i.imgur.com/C1Zog.jpg)
 * [test render](http://i.imgur.com/ipYeS.jpg)
* 3D Coat
 * [texture](http://i.imgur.com/XCbTk.jpg)
 * [test render](http://i.imgur.com/3v7KA.jpg)
* Mudbox
 * texture was ptex, so no texture map here
 * [test render](http://i.imgur.com/KsZTI.jpg)
* Photoshop and 3Ds Max workflow
 * [early work in progress](http://i.imgur.com/X9Qyb.jpg)

TL;DR:

*  When texturing for games, do you prefer working in resolution that the final texture is going to be, or do you work in higher resolution and downscale later? why?

* What is your texturing workflow? How did you come to use your workflow?",,False,self,t5_2qhxp,False,,,True,t3_qnhnj,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/qnhnj/texture_painting_your_workflow_experience_and/,

So most of my experience is based around Realflow/C4D/AE. I was thinking of using trapcode but don't feel like I could have much control over the particles system in comparison to C4D or 3DS Max (if i need to learn it).

I have given myself a 6month deadline to create something similar to this - http://vimeo.com/6794856

I'm currently making some plans to hopefully land a job in the CG world (same ol' story) and I'd have some questions for those of you guys who went through all the trouble and managed to get through.

First of all, and it's quite a big one: I don't have any graduation whatsoever. I live in France and I dropped in mid highschool. Thankfully I was quite lucky to never have trouble making some money, and I currently have quite a decent job in a small tv station. The point is, I'm kind of afraid that the fact that I never went through any standard formation system in the industry might lower my odds of being hired. Do companies and studios pay more attention to the fact that you have a substential reel to show or to that you actually went to that one school that gives that diploma?

My second question was more about the work itself. I've been working for about six years mostly on personal projects, learning everything I could here and there, mainly about lighting and compositing. I work on AE, Nuke and Max on a daily basis, but I tend to go in every direction, exploring absolutely every aspect of the softwares that I can, some aspects more lightly than others.
Should I focus on one particular skill and leave the others to a minimum? Or should I diversify, explore other softwares and whatnot? I know that most team-based projects include people working each one on a specific task, so I wonder if being able to occupy several different spots on the pipeline if needed is what most companies are after.

Thanks a lot for your time, I'd love to read some input from guys with more experience than me",,False,self,t5_2qhxp,False,,,True,t3_1gskwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/1gskwy/getting_into_the_industry/,

* Hold X for gridsnap, C for curve snap, V for vertex snap while moving things. also hold D to move centerpoint of objects instead of the object itself.

And how is it rendering-wise? I use a lot of VRAYforC4D. Does VRay exist for modo and if so, how does it compare?",,False,self,t5_2qhxp,False,,,True,t3_1azv3p,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/1azv3p/does_anybody_have_experience_with_both_modo_and/,

The photos are high resolution raws of historic stone. Focusing on large stitch-able sections of walls and doors, arrow slits, windows etc. Large parts of some of the walls have been freshly built, perfect for historic cg of castles etc. They are lens corrected but untreated photos, not tiling textures, but a large amount can be stitched together to make large sections of walls/ramparts. The photos are also shot on very overcast/fog days to reduce shadowing, the result is very flat. My feeling from texturing this kind of work in the past, is to the leave the photos un-cropped and un-stiched.

I feel the textures could be useful for any 3d artists wanting to build historic stone buildings. Especially if they live somewhere that lacks in European historic stone walls!   

So.. I was thinking about trying to sell them just as a little sideline. I'm not really interested in selling individual photos on a stock site, as the photos fit together, they would logically fit together in packs containing 250+ photos. (I'm not trying to sell them to you now as they are far from complete)

But before I do I would really appreciate some input.  

Do you think this is a good idea? Do you think there's a market for the kind of textures I've described?
Do you ever buy or sell texture packs? If so from which sites, which sites are the leaders at doing it?
Would you appreciate un-cropped photo sets instead of tiling textures?

I would like to supply the highest image quality if needed. Which formats would you find useful to download textures as, .RAW, .jpeg, .tiff, .exr etc?  
If I was to set up a small website to sell the textures using a paypal file downloady thing, what would be the best way to promote. 

I would like to give good value to freelancers and for personal use but would like to make more money if it was being used by large companies for commercial work, what do you reckon texture packs are worth to larger companies? 
Do you have any advice?

If this isn't the right forum for this kind of request, please let me know. 

Here's the scope: We're creating a short simulation of a combine driving through a field and loading a tractor-pulled grain cart off to the side. It's from the POV of inside the combine, and we're using two monitors to simulate the view from the left and front windows and possibly a rear-view mirror view as well.
If you [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5_ipWoEpSI&amp;feature=related) from about 1:45 you'll see the view.

It looks like a matter of acquiring off-the-shelf models of a tractor, grain-cart, and possibly a semi truck, and skinning and tweaking them to the client's specs; modeling a corn or wheat field and the rest of the environment; and animating the models going through several maneuvers as seen through the left and front windows of the combine. It doesn't have to be photo-realistic, but something good enough for a decent FPS game. Output is QuickTime to be used in an interactive exhibit. Deadline is Sept. 14.

Can you give me a ballpark estimate of what an animator would charge? Also, yes, we're looking for someone who can do the job. PM me if you're seriously interested. Thanks a lot.

Thank you for your input, everyone. You've given more information than I was expecting, and I am very grateful.  
  
****

Hello,
  
So I'm a web developer/designer by trade, but in my free time I like to experiment with other projects to expand my horizons. Flash for 2d animation and games is great, and After Effects for particle physics fascinates me.
  
However, I've been saving up some money to buy some CGI 3d software (please forgive my lack of technical terms,) and I'd like a breakdown of some software that is currently on the market. 
  
My questions are as follows:
  
* Cut scenes seen in current games such as the later Metal Gear Solid games, Devil May Cry, God of War, etc. What software is used for the character modeling? What software for the landscape and texture modeling?
  
* How difficult are the learning curves in programs like Maya, 3D Studio Max, and Blender? Would having experience in programs such as After Effects help my understanding of the software in any way?
  
* Would you recommend any sites where I could get started with tutorials, breakdown of settings and effects, and such? 
  
  
Thank you in advance for any help you can provide me with.
  
I know I have delusions of grandeur citing examples like MGS4 and DMC, but hopefully with tons of practice and late nights I can make some of my ideas fluidly come to life.

Questions:
Does it make sense to build solid models and then port them over to a different graphics package?

Is this crazy or do people actually do this?

Would imported solids be dumb geometry?

Is there a nice in-between modeling package or a go-between plugin?

Is there an easy way to port my skills to polygon or NURB modeling?

The math is over my head, obviously, but I was wondering if anyone else has accidentally run into the same problem. It would help me narrow down my search for what went wrong in my code.

My code is based off of the [implementation by Stefan Gustavson](http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/~stegu/aqsis/aqsis-newnoise/), but coded in C++11. In case anyone is curious, [my implementation is here](http://gist.github.com/jrandom/5475614) (update: fixed, see edit #3 below). I've currently only ever tested the 3-argument overload of Generate(). This is for a Lightwave plugin, which is where the linked images at the start of this post come from.

*Edit: SOLVED! It's a bug in the reference implementation: There's some array index wrapping using modulus, and modulus preserves sign. This results in negative indices being used to access the lookup arrays. Using the absolute value before applying modulus fixes the problem.*

*Edit #2: Not entirely solved. Argh. A render shows that I now have a [whole new kind of artifact](http://imgur.com/Wfcvfhx) to deal with in the form of discontinuous banding. Crud.*

*Edit #3: Final actual really-reals fix: Incoming integer values below zero must be inverted (subtracted from 255), and also shifted to avoid an off-by-one error. This cleanly wraps all values correctly through the permutation table.*

This is not a post looking for a job. I am not so shameless. I am just looking for for ideas from people with experience*

I have no idea if it is a good idea to post this. I may remove the links later. But maybe I can get some light here...

I work in a very small brazilian studio. I am looking to get a job in another studio anywhere here or in the world that is close to the sea and, if possible, uses blender. 

There are very few studios out there that uses blender. So capable workforce is, as far as I know, rare here. I consider myself to be capable to work in most small studios with blender or 3dsmax. But the results of my quest are difficult to understand so far.

Here is my reel, though outdated (I plan on doing a new one next months) hhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV-uzAzOXuw&amp;hd=1

Here are my commercial stills http://guismoale.tumblr.com/post/32517216112/trabalhos-produzidos-nas-empresas-onde-trabalhei

The thing is, all small studios I've sent email have not even answered me. One small studio was looking for someone with my specific habilites to work with blender. They only answered ""your data is in our database now. Thanks"" and never more.  Another one that I personally went, again working with blender, said my work was on par with their or better, and they would really like to have me there, but later did not answer any emails after I left. Everyone else says that my work is too good for those studios (I don't think that, just repeating what people say). My boss don't want me to go. My ex-bosses keeps asking me to go back.

I am sure I don't ask for a big salary. Actually, I just mentioned in the one looking for people. It was something like 1.300 dollars/month. 

I know you people are probably not from brazil and would not know about the market here (and I am a little scared to ask around in brasilian forums and get myself in trouble in the future for who nows what reason). But what do you think?  Is my works still too bad for a small studio? Is it something else? I ask for too much money? Too little? Maybe it is the way I put the reel?

What should I change in my work or my attitude to get a job with my upcoming new reel? I plan to spend the rest of the year preparing it, and then sending it to every studio close to the sea, with or without blender. I must not screw things when that time comes.

I have been approached by a few of the staff members to help design a low-cost rendering farm for the Simulation and Game Design department.  Currently, all students are rendering on PC's with integrated graphics, and 2.3 GHz processors.  Not what I would really call conducive to completing projects in class in a timely manner.

I have been told that they have a total of 16 NVidia Quaddro 600 cards to use for this project, unless I can come up with a better solution on a low budget.  I will admit that I do not do rendering work myself, so I am still reading up on exactly what all is involved here, to make an informed decision.  

By comparing specs, I have found out that the Quaddro 600 cards are only capable of around 124 GFLOPS, and have 92 CUDA cores per card.  However, I have also seen that the NVidia GTX 560 Ti graphics cards are capable of 1263.4 GFLOPS, and have 384 CUDA cores per card, and the GTX 580 = 1581.1 GFLOPS and 512 CUDA cores. Now, I know that there is a big difference between workstation level cards and ""gamer"" graphics cards, but honestly it would look to me like the GTX series cards would have an advantage here.  Especially from a price standpoint.

The department is wanting to spend as little money as possible, and are not wanting the ""Best money can buy"".  They are looking to purchase and setup an affordable solution for the students to use that will perform better than using the workstations that they are currently using to create their renders.  

So, if anyone would be so kind as to let me know the difference between the GTX series graphics cards, and the Quaddro Series cards for rendering purposes, that would be great.

I got a question, or rather need a sugestion.
So far my workflow for game models is to create high poly, create low poly model over it, uv map low poly model and project ambient occlusion lighting from high poly to low poly model, which i use then for the guide for 2D texture painting in photoshop. I was wondering is it possible, and is there any accesible software that would allow me to paint high poly model in 3D, and then projecting it on the low poly model. I think zbrush has this functionality, but not sure how will it work with models completely modeled in other software with subdiv modelling. 

It would make sense to me to do it in zbrush, but the problem im stuck on is uvw mapping of the high poly model. I tend to work with a lot of separate objects, which will obviously have their own uvw coordinates that will overlap, which im guessign will be an issue while generating a texture in zbrush. And i would really like to avoid unwrapping 2 mil polygon models if i still have to unwrap the low poly anyway.

tl;dr: looking for a software that allows painting high poly models in 3d without necessity of uvwmapping and is able to project it on the uvw coords of low poly version of the same model.

edit: just realised. Will importing high poly model into zbrush without uvw coordinates (which will force zbrush native mozaic like way of uvwmapping(?)) then paint it and then use xnormal function of projecting that ""mozaic"" into proper coordinates?

thanks for any help.

edit2: hmmm just realise one more thing, will zbrush project high poly to low poly if its just colour in similiar way as it can project normal maps? sorry have no zbrush at home so can't check it myself.",,False,self,t5_2qhxp,True,,,True,t3_id62p,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/id62p/realtime_3d_painting_tool_question/,

Just to be clear, I'm not actually animating it, at least that's not my main concern. I know with OpenGL I could just traverse the hierarchy, convert the quaternion to angle-axis, and use the matrix stack to do the transformations.

Here's my current approach: I'm writing this in Python, with two NumPy matrices of shape nbones x 4 (for the quaternions) and nbones x 3 (for the translations). The quaternions are in (w, x, y, z) order. I've also got a list `bone_parents` that gives the index of each bone's parent or -1 if the bone is the root. They're stored in order such that a bone never precedes its parent.

In case the notation is unfamiliar: `numpy.cross` and `numpy.dot` compute cross and dot products respectively, `numpy.zeros_like` just creates an array of the same shape filled with zeros, and `numpy.concatenate` just joins two vectors together for the purposes here. Vector addition and scalar-vector multiplication work like you'd expect them to. You can think of `for i, a in enumerate(b):` as `for (i = 0; i &lt; b.length; i++) { a = b[i]; .... }`. Without further ado, here's the code:

\*\*\* *REDACTED, there's too much bad code on the web already* \*\*\*

So, this runs, and the result in `absolute_trans` looks nothing like the right coordinates when I plot them. Ditto if I first rotate by absolute_angle, or relative_angle. What am I doing wrong?

**UPDATE:** I've solved it, I'll explain my solution for the sake of future Googlers, that they may have more luck with Google than I did. Apparently I a) had a screwy definition of the quaternion product (missing a factor of 1/2, for starters) so I switched to a more explicit definition (straight from Wikipedia):

    def quat_multiply(q1, q2):
        a1, b1, c1, d1 = q1
        a2, b2, c2, d2 = q2
        return np.array([
            a1 * a2 - b1 * b2 - c1 * c2 - d1 * d2,
            a1 * b2 + b1 * a2 + c1 * d2 - d1 * c2,
            a1 * c2 - b1 * d2 + c1 * a2 + d1 * b2,
            a1 * d2 + b1 * c2 - c1 * b2 + d1 * a2]
        )

    def quat_multiply_conj(a, b):
        b = b.copy()
        b[1:] *= -1
        return quat_multiply(a, b)

    def rotate(q, v):
        return quat_multiply_conj(quat_multiply(q, v), q)

The second flaw was with the order I was doing things in, I think. Thinking through it, given the global rotation and translation of the previous joint, the new global rotation was just the multiplication of the previous global with the local quaternion. The more subtle point was that the new global translation is obtained by 
 
 1. starting at the origin,
 2. applying the new local translation,
 3. *rotating that point* by the old global rotation,
 4. adding to this *rotated* version of the local translation to the old global translation.

Here's the corrected code:


    def get_3d_pose(relative_angle, relative_trans, bone_parents):
        absolute_angle = relative_angle.copy()
        absolute_trans = numpy.zeros_like(relative_angle)
        absolute_trans[:, 1:] = relative_trans
        for bone_id, parent in enumerate(bone_parents):
            if parent &gt;= 0:
                absolute_angle[bone_id] = quat_multiply(
                    absolute_angle[parent],
                    absolute_angle[bone_id]
                )
                absolute_trans[bone_id] = rotate(absolute_angle[parent],
                                                 absolute_trans[bone_id])
                absolute_trans[bone_id] += absolute_trans[parent]

As you can see I'm having nasty grain problems in the ears, and pretty much everywhere where there is SSS. Not sure where this is coming from.

I've tried increasing render settings, increasing the light samples, SSS material samples (although I might have done this part wrong), and other stuff.

If anyone has a solution I would be very grateful. 


__________________________


EDIT: PROBLEM SOLVED

__________________________


So, problem solved, and it wasn't anything I would have predicted. I learned a couple things about vray noise and troubleshooting in general from the posts here.

The problem, strangely enough, was that my SSS_COLOR map was too noisy, casing those massive bright pixels. 

I eventually went into photoshop, gave the whole thing a nice blur, and then used that as a scatter map. 

The result is one the left: http://i.imgur.com/GHDvXPC.jpg

Obviously this leaves me with the problem of having a poorly detailed subsurfacescatter color map, but now that I know I can hopefully fix it without reintroducing the problem. 

Anyways, just wanted  to say thanks everyone for all the help. I really got frustrated with this one, but I'm really liking vray in general. Also its the stubborn problems that teach you the most, so I guess I learned a lot.

A friend of mine just heard about 3D printing for the first time.  Her first reaction was ""Oh my god this is crazy. I need one of these. I could make as many Nabisco Shredded Wheat Spoonmen as I wanted! It's my favorite long lost toy from childhood.""  

I think it would be pretty damn cool if we could make this happen...  However, I'm not all that good at 3D sculpting and I am hoping somebody can help point me in the right direction.  I think I can get the basic shape down, but I just know I'm going to have difficulty with the antennae and perhaps the flat part of the feet.  I'm not the best and 3D sculpting and have only been using ZBrush for a short time.  

Here are some links that I've found for reference that I'm going to work with:  
  
A [still photo from flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neatocoolville/300128860/), and this [commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxpfJxzoCXQ) that I found on youtube.  

I'm not sure I can even use ZBrush to recreate these.  The basic organic shape is no problem, but I know I'm going to have some difficulty.  I'll post some pics when I get home from work and get started on it...  
  
Also, I've never 3D printed anything before.  What would something like this cost me?  Any suggestions for getting a good deal?

http://i.imgur.com/znXBz0x.png Here's a little toy plane model. I'm not happy with the messy mesh of the tail. Also I can't figure out how to properly import the material into Unity. I'm going to start Unity Tutorials soon, so if you have any tips on 3D modeling in Unity and using Blender for that, that would be great.

1374806359.0,3,self.computergraphics,1j2m8q,"A key 'uncanny valley feature' in human face graphics, especially animations, that should be easy to avoid",yudlejoza,11,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/1j2m8q/a_key_uncanny_valley_feature_in_human_face/,"I'm a computer graphics enthusiast (not an artist myself) who is excited about improvements with every passing day.

I just came up with a hypothesis, a key reason for the ""uncanny valley"" affect in human faces, especially in animations but in still images as well.

Eye focus and pupil dilation!

If eyes of a CGI character focus on ""camera"", they should come closer to each other or go far apart, depending upon how near or far the camera is. I think most CGI artists gloss over this fact.

Secondly, pupil dilation should also play some part in photorealism. I think the so called ""life-like eye contact"" that's missing in CGI characters, can be manifested by doing something with the pupil dilation.

What do you guys think? I'd love to see someone try these as experiments and post something on reddit.

Although I think this might not be a new idea, especially Disney/Pixar/etc animators might know this already.

P.S.: I was just browsing this amazing artist [SaphireNishi on deviantart](http://saphirenishi.deviantart.com) (NSFW) and came up with the idea.

-Example: I have procedural bumps making pores in skin. They look pretty good to me, but would they look better with a normal map? I just can't see how they could or what sort of light interaction is not happening that should. 

I guess I know that the light is going to be light or dark at opposites in a bump map, do normal maps provide much more accuracy in the sense that it's susceptible to a full 360 degree range of opposition? 

Is it something that is imperceptible at scales as small as pores on a face?

I was wondering if you guys knew the best way of viewing my models in 3D on my portfolio website, I was thinking off the bat that unity would be a fairly good choice, my models are all aimed for realtime engines. If I can I would like an engine that supports anti-aliasing and the 3 basic texture types normal, specular and diffuse. I would also like to avoid third party hosts if I can.

Thanks in advance I'll be sure to post any of my own findings here for you all to see.",,False,self,t5_2qhxp,False,,,True,t3_1dl4dt,http://www.reddit.com/r/computergraphics/comments/1dl4dt/best_platform_for_3d_models_on_my_portfolio/,
