N4G discussion: [SimCity Modder Plays Offline, Could Increase City Size](http://n4g.com/news/1207991/simcity-modder-plays-offline-could-increase-city-size)

---------

Bullet points with recent modding discoveries:

* Players have reverse engineered modding. Significant parts of the game's code is in Javascript.

* The game can be played without an internet connection indefinitely after modding. Can only stay in one city.

* SimCity has behavior for offline save handling. When offline, your city is saved and is uploaded to Origin the next time you go online. Offline mode seemed to be cut hastily. 

* Debug tools were left open, allowing 'griefing' other people's cities by setting DEBUG=1.

* ""Big maps"" are referenced multiple times in the game's code. Possible DLC regions with big city plots? It's the only way they can increase the city size without breaking existing maps.

* Internal terraforming tools were discovered, but requires a special build of the game.

* Population numbers are faked / inflated - *GetFudgedPopulation*. [chart](http://i.imgur.com/AhIm3Gu.png) - thanks fat_ugly_midget.

* After modding, you can play around **outside** 2km^2 plot, and it saves syncs to the server.

* Latest patch has made package files read only, and disabled debug tools / the cheat console. (Confirm please, I do not own / will not support the game)

-------

A reverse-engineered [modding guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a8bw7/how_to_mod_sim_city_2013_getting_started_basics) was posted on /r/simcity earlier today by /u/Plornt. Locked terraforming tools^1 were discovered too.

Thanks to the power of the internet, another user on reddit has being able to build highways outside the 2km^2 plot, removing the fake population inflation^2, and even being able to play the game **without a connection** to EA's servers. In the unmodded game, you will get kicked out after 20 minutes, but now it can be trivially patched to indefinitely. Server features like region play, and save/load handling are obviously not available.

Looking at the JS code posted on GitHub (not linked here since possible copyright infringement), it ~~certainly looks like~~ confirmed the forced disconnect is totally implemented in Javascript and is client sided. This is a really sloppy implementation of always online ""DRM"". 

This is indicative that offline support was hastily removed late during the development cycle. Possible EA/Maxis debate/internal conflicts?

^1: Only developer builds could actually make use of terraforming, but the UI is there. It may be for internal use only (to sell new regions as DLC?), or just buggy / clunky.

^2: The population displayed on the user interface becomes inflated after the first 500 sims. This is intentional and not a bug, as the function name is *""GetFudgedPopulation""*. A 'million' population city only has 100,000 real agents.

**TL;DR:** SimCity kicks you out after 20 minutes of being disconnected from EA servers, JavaScript mod allows you to bypass this part of the DRM.

UPDATE 2: If you guys thought Hammerpoint would change their tune after this fiasco you are sorely mistaken, I just had my game/forum accounts banned.... reading the forums it seems they are once again kicking their censors into overtime, deleting/moving almost all of the negative threads on the game and banning those responsible for them.

I assume my game/forum accounts were banned because I have started some of the big discussion threads on the front page about the game being removed from Steam/the Forbes article.. no matter, refund soon.

UPDATE 3: Sergey is still blaming his customers over himself and still can't work up the courage and decency to apologize. He is also still trying to deliberately mislead people - http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash/

People are having their game/forum accounts permanently banned for trying to show people where to obtain legal and offered refunds from Steam.

UPDATE 4-Xsolla Refunds: If you purchased the game from the website and NOT through Steam, you can go to http://chat.xsolla.com/ and get a refund. Xsolla is their payment company. 

Whether you get one or not will depend heavily on the rep that you get so if you get refused once keep trying. If you did not accept the ""no refunds"" terms of service agreement make note of that to them and even if you did, tell them that it doesn't mean a single thing because it is not legal to bar people from refunds using such methods.

Seriously? The next attempt to join is in A HALF A FUCKING HOUR!?

I don't want to play on a server, I don't want to play with other people. I knew going in to this game that it'd require a constant connection, but to have to wait in a queue? When my only active game is private!? What the fuck am I waiting for!?

I love Sim City, I even pre-ordered this game. But holy shit I've never been burned like this when buying a game.


Whoever the hell thought this was a good idea deserves to be fired.

**EDIT:** Okay, I get it, I made a bad decision buying this game. I figured from everything I'd read that the always-on part of the game simply required an internet connection, not a slot on a server like I'm about to PvP or something. I'd be more understanding if I could just play my *private* region by myself like I intended. Instead I'm pissed.

**ESEA Statement has been released! Full post at the bottom of this post or [click here to read on esea.net](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=12692)**

ESEA Member unisolsz discovered that the client required to play on ESEA was running a [bitcoin miner](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining). After players were complaining about virus alerts being set off from the client and unusually high GPU usage and BSOD errors.

[The thread he made regarding this can be found here](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492102)

ESEA admin, lpkane admits that it was an ""April Fools joke"" that was mistakenly left in the client that ran for only 2 days. He claims only 2 bitcoins were mined in total (Roughly around $280 USD) and that it would go towards a prize pool. [Source](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492134)

He later corrects that it was running for 2+ weeks and actually raised 29~ bitcoins (around $3,602.21 USD) and to apologize awarded all current ESEA premium members a free month of service and that all the money raised will go into the prize pool. He also claims that all bitcoin mining code was removed from the client. [Source #2](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492152)

Bitcoin miners use up 100% of GPU processes and lead to a lowered hardware lifespan, and can actually damage it permanently. 

Link to /r/GlobalOffensive discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1dgad2/esea_client_basically_a_virus/

**UPDATE:** Someone has pointed out that the bitcoin address that lpkane posted [a picture of in his first post](http://www.picsend.net/images/923377coin.jpg) is different compared to the [address he lists in his second post.](http://i.imgur.com/BuPbk5b.png) Very strange...

**UPDATE #2:** I should clarify that no one that was affected lost any money of their own. It was a poor choice of words for me to say that he 'stole' the money. I was referring to the fact that people that were affected most likely saw an increase in electricity usage, and could possibly have had their computer's hardware damaged. Their computers were used without their consent to 'mine' currency, all of which went to the ESEA admins.

**UPDATE #3:** I was contacted by /u/GGTY886 that informed me that he had posted a thread regarding the mining two hours before unisolsz had posted his that was locked by an admin. [Located here](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492064)

There is also a thread located [here](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=491845) by a user that discusses the symptoms of the miner.

He also sent me a recording of a conversation with an ESEA admin discussing the issue which can be listened to here: [The Recording](http://www.twitch.tv/ggty886/b/397871712)

His PM in full in case you're interested:
&gt;I actually posted a thread before unisolz that actually exposed the bitcoin mining. http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492064

&gt;I posted 2 hours before his thread, and my thread was locked.

&gt;Also, one day prior, this guy posted about the symptoms of the mining: http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=491845

&gt;recording with ESEA Admin: http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492190

**UPDATE #4:** Others have pointed out that this isn't the first time lpkane has mentioned mining bitcoins through the ESEA client: http://i.imgur.com/yvMX2DY.png

[Source](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=poll&amp;d=comments&amp;id=806)

**UPDATE #5:** In a thread dated 4/9/2013, lpkane posts in a thread discussing bitcoins:

&gt;and you wonder what the client does when you're not in a server..

**UPDATE #7:** Another image that was requested to be added to the OP showing lpkane's comments on bitcoin mining on September 18th, 2012. http://i.imgur.com/SrhyF8d.png

**UPDATE #8:** Craig Levine ""Torbull"" (owner of ESEA) has posted this statement on the forums regarding the situation:

&gt;The first I learned about any of this was last night (on any scale). I had no idea any of this was going on.

&gt;Needless to say I am completely embarrassed, disgusted, and ashamed. 

&gt;For the past ten years, I've tried to do nothing more than to act honestly and be an upstanding leader in the gaming community and with some bad decisions by some trusted people it has been thrown out the window. 

&gt;I'm wrapping my mind around this whole thing and we'll release a formal response, but for the time being just know that this wasn't some ESEA / company wide scam.

&gt;I'm committed to doing whatever possible to rebuild the trust we lost through this whole fiasco.

[Source Post #608](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492152)

Some more information from Craig:

**Post #632**: 
&gt;It's a failure on my part to have the proper oversight to have prevented this from happening and it will be addressed.

&gt;My primary concern at this point is community trust and how that was destroyed. We need to understand the situation, take the appropriate action with those responsible for it, ensure we have things in place to prevent this from happening, and address anyone who incurred physical damages.

&gt;How we rebuild the trust of the community in the immediate aftermath and long term future is going to be a different discussion that we need to have as I walk through this all.

**Post #710**:
&gt; **Standby for a more formal response with information about the situation and recourse for those impacted.**

**Post #742**:
&gt;the facts of the situation are beyond what has been shared to this point.

&gt;We're going to do everything in our power to address the issue of what happened, the broken trust with the community, and any physical hardware damage. Information coming soon, but this is obviously something we take incredibly serious.

**Post #802**:
&gt;**the money will be going somewhere much more righteous than the prize purse in addition to the prize purse**

**Post #810**:
&gt;why would we risk our business and livelihood on making some inconsequential amount of money on Bitcoins

&gt;I assure you that I and the larger ESEA entity had no knowledge of this. We're working to figure out what happened to respond accordingly.

**Post #829**:
&gt;His ([lpkane's](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=488095&amp;find_comment_number=23#n23)) response there was done more playfully than seriously. We would never knowingly allow this to be done to our community and I'm looking into all of the details for how this happened.

**Post #886**:
&gt;**We will be setting up a mechanism to address anyone who's computer parts were damaged through this process**


**UPDATE #9:** /u/PrincessChoadzilla has posted a analysis of the three bitcoin addresses ESEA admins used to collect the bitcoins [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dglil/popular_competitive_gaming_league_esea_admins/c9qfc56) and found that there has been 1 bitcoin that is still not accounted for by lpkane.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** [ESEA Statement has been released](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=12692):

&gt;Throughout the history of gaming and e-sports, there have been scams and straight up theft by players, teams, event organizers, and even “sponsors.” Over the past ten years ESEA has prided itself on being an upstanding member of the gaming community by providing a high quality service, paying out prize money, and being upfront and transparent with you, the community. We worked hard to build your trust and often took the longer, slower, and more meticulous road than others. That approach has paid off as we had success with our premium service and league. Over the two weeks we failed our community.

&gt;ESEA’s goal is to provide our community with cutting edge technology and tools. Whenever possible, the management and owners at ESEA initiate private tests on potential new products and tools that might interest our community. With the whole fervor around Bitcoin, we did conduct some internal tests with the Client on only two of our own, consenting administrators’ accounts to see how the mining process worked and determine whether it was a feature that we might want to add in the future. We thought this might be an exciting new tool that we could provide to our community. Ultimately, we decided that it was not.

&gt;On April 13, 2013, after the initial tests, ESEA informed those involved in the test that we were killing the project and they should stop using the beta test. It came to our attention last night, however, that an employee who was involved in the test has been using the test code for his own personal gain since April 13, 2013. What transpired the past two weeks is a case of an employee acting on his own and without authorization to access our community through our company’s resources. We are extremely disappointed and concerned by the unauthorized actions of this unauthorized individual. As of this morning, ESEA has made sure that all Bitcoin mining has stopped. ESEA is also in the process of taking all necessary steps internally to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.

&gt;The owners and management at ESEA all apologize to each of you that were impacted by the recent events and intend to make things right. ESEA has issued a free month of ESEA Premium to all of our community members who were enrolled in Premium for the month of April. We also ask anyone who has experienced any physical damage to their computers to open an ESEA support ticket.

&gt;In an effort to maintain complete transparency, we have released all of the Bitcoin wallet addresses as well as data dumps of the wallets themselves. The value of the mined Bitcoins was $3,713.50 and ESEA will be donating 100% of the $3,713.55 to the American Cancer Society. ESEA will also match 100% of this amount for a total of $7,427.10 donated. ESEA is also increasing the Season 14 League prize pot by $3,713.50.

&gt;As a team, we work hard to create cool things and we’ve worked even harder to consistently do things the right way. While it’s incredibly disturbing and disappointing that this happened, we’re committed to improving ourselves and rebuilding trust with our community.

**Original Post**

WarZ Devs have reportedly just released a patch which proves their quick money-grabbing and game-breaking schemes. After changing the description of their game due to TotalHailbut calling them out on false advertising, they have now updated the game with a new patch.

Steam users are reporting the following: ""... They actually increased the respawn-timer from 1 hour to 4 hours. BUT they added a revive button, where you can spend 50GC (real money) to revive them instantly.""
Additionally, they are now forcing you to sign the TOS to play the game, which includes disallowing refunds. This is against the law.

How is it against the law? False advertising, which is still going on. [CLICKY](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/cases/redress.shtml)

**Updates**

News is unraveling extremely fast about WarZ and its current stature. Here is all of the latest.

**1.** I was just banned for spreading the truth. WarZ devs now have control of the forum on steam and are banning/covering up the truth.
Proof: [CLICKY](http://puu.sh/1CvE4)

**2.** User [Thunderbridge](http://www.reddit.com/user/Thunderbridge) makes a great comment below on how they are working their money system.
""Umm how about refund posts are not allowed on these forums. You must submit a support ticket at support.thewarz.com and have your case reviewed. They don't want you going through Steam support to get a refund, they want you to go to their site where, after accepting their new TOS, you are no longer entitled to a refund, while they laugh all the way to the bank. That's called fraud by the way"". Well said.

**3.**User [WinstonBoxfeathers](http://www.reddit.com/user/WinstonBoxfeathers) finds a post by the developers blaming the users for the multiple different ways to interpret their false advertising. [CLICKY](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79251-Steam-purchase-page-issues)

**4.** User [maleficmatt](http://www.reddit.com/user/maleficmatt) tells others how to avoid the TOS - if you have had the displeasure of buying the game.
""Just an FYI for people, if you hit decline on the TOS after the game patches the client will close. You can then simply reboot the client and the TOS will not show up. I have not yet hit ""accept"" on the TOS since the game launched. Not sure if this works with the steam version"". Nice find!

**TL;DR** We get both versions now, and they may be merged one day in the future.

Thank you redditors, you're awesome. And thanks 2K, and to Tom personally, for not ignoring us. Now we know we can affect the publishers' decisions, and I hope this leads to a better future without region locks.

**Important information**

# An interesting possible solution to region locks

From the comments: region lock *gifts*. So you still get the world version for an adequate price (relative money, remember?), but you can't trade/gift it to anyone outside your region. Maybe let you gift games to people from other countries if you pay extra ( $world_price - $local_price ).

**Black list of region locked games on Steam (with publishers)**

* Borderlands 2 (2K, a.k.a. Take Two, no region locks on retail version)
* Confrontation (Focus Home Interactive)
* Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition (Namco Bandai, no region locks on retail version)
* F1 2012 (Codemasters)
* Max Payne 3 (Rockstar, a.k.a 2K, a.k.a. Take Two)
* Ridge Racer Unbounded (Namco Bandai)
* Spec Ops: The Line (2K, a.k.a. Take Two)
* The Witcher 2 (CD Project, 1C -- investigating, no region locks on retail version)

**Clarification on 'no region locks on retail (boxed) version':** The version bought directly from Steam is region locked, the boxed version also uses Steam, but isn't region locked.

This list is based on Steam CDR data, and therefore is fully complete.

**Black list of region locked retail games (with publishers)**

* Darksiders 2 (THQ)
* Prototype 2 (Activision)
* Risen 2 (Deep Silver)
* Trine 2 (Atlus)
* Most, if not all, Valve games
* Most, if not all, Bethesda games

This list is not complete, please suggest more in the comments.

**Black list of non-Steam region locked games**

* Battlefield 3 (EA)
&lt;most likely, other EA games, unconfirmed&gt;
* Diablo 3 (Activision Blizzard)
* Mass Effect 3 (EA)
* StarCraft 2 (Activision Blizzard)

This list is not complete, please suggest more in the comments.

**UPD 19:24 15.09.2012 (UTC):** I never thought I'd have to post that, but it turns out I have. There are people in the comments openly insulting Russia and its people with ultra broad generalizations (ERMAGHERD RUSSERNZ RUIN DERTA FER EVERWERN). As much as I can understand your hate (I don't like playing with such people myself), it should be directed to specific people you don't like playing with, not a country as a whole, and preferably using the Report button and not Reddit for that. I'm not writing this update because I'm Russian, I'm writing this because what you're doing is just outright wrong and you have no right to judge a whole country by a nonrepresentative selection of people you play DotA with. I would have stood up for any country, but trust me, there's more to Russia than DotA kids. So please, if you have nothing to contribute to the discussion except hate and this special form of internet racism, GTFO.

So, here's the whole story. I preordered Borderlands 2, expecting it to be the [global version](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/app/49520). There was nothing stated on the preorder page a few days ago, so I just went for it. When the game showed up in my library, it was named 'Borderlands 2 RU'. That was suspicious, but I decided to wait and see. Today I learned that I got a [completely different version](http://cdr.thebronasium.com/app/217490). What's the difference?

The biggest one is *the AppID*. Basically, *we won't be able to play with the rest of the world*. Ever. (*Clarification*: this is not just because of a different AppID, it's because of the region lock. It is stated on 1C's website explicitly.) And, we likely *won't be able to get DLC* either. The *people who preordered the Season Pass* are now *unable to activate it*, because it's meant for a different AppID.

Secondly, the game is *region locked*. Go outside Russia, boom, you can't play any more. This also seems to not be the case with the retail (boxed) version.

Then, *we can't preload the game*. All we get is *a 40MB package* of no one knows what.

Also, *no one knows if the game is going to be multi-language*. If it's not, we're stuck with one of the worst translations ever. The Gunzerker is called 'Шизострел', from 'шизофрения' - schizophrenia and 'стрелять' - shoot. The most adequate translation I can come up with is 'Schizo shooter'. This is *a whole new level of shitty translations*. And now the Steam pages say that the game will only be playable in Russian.

But wait, there's more. Users from *Ukraine, Lithuania, Estonia, and some other countries* are getting the exact same version. Yeah, the Russian one. The likely *Russian only* one. There are more people who speak English than those who speak Russian in Lithuania. And yet, they're *forced to get the Russian version*. They paid full price. $60, €50, whatever. They didn't even pay less. And now they get a cut version.

Oh, did I mention that the Russian version is *not giftable?*

Why am I posting this to reddit? Because it's not only about Borderlands 2. *Removing languages, region locks for net play, no Steam preloads* - it's becoming *common practice* for the Western publishers. *Diablo 3* is *region and language locked*. *StarCraft II* is *region locked, language locked* and it has *subscriptions*. Yes, you read that right. Only in Russia. *Battlefield 3* is language locked.

Blah blah blah piracy blah blah. I don't care. I paid for the game. I would have paid $60 for the game if that was the price. And now I want to be *treated like a customer*, not like an *evil hacker pirate genius* that I'm somehow assumed to be *by default*.

So here's where you come in, reddit. We need hype. Lots of it.  We need to make this public. We need to make them fix their shit. We want to be treated equally. Please, help us.

After that is finished, I have the rest of the time to interview and video anyone I want at the expo for my own purposes. So I thought to myself, why not let /r/games decide who I interview and what I ask?

If you guys think this is a good idea, here's what I hope to do:

**1. Ask questions and interview people based on reddit requests.**

 The comments and questions that get the most up votes will be the ones I would aim for first. I want to let people interact with the developers so we can have our questions answered!

**2. Provide extremely fast response times.**

I'll do my best to upload video interviews as fast as I can. I'll knock out an interview, upload it and then go straight to the next one. I'll try to make it as quick as possible.

**3. Give you the highest quality footage I can.**

I'm shooting with ~$20,000 of equipment. I can bring high quality to the floor without a doubt. Sound appealing to you? Thought so. :)


Lastly: I know E3 is going to be covered by all sorts of press. Including many of our favorite people to watch. I might not be able to compete with them but I figure I can be very specific and tend to exactly what redditors want to hear and see. Let me know what you think!

TL:DR (I'm going to E3, want to cover what redditors want to see and answer questions directly from redditors. Would that be appealing to you?)

* **Update #5 Valve Employee Response**

**/u/smeehrrr (Valve Employee)**
&gt;**Valve employee here. This was a human error on the part of the support agent moving the funds to the correct account. It is not indicative of an exploit. The account in question has been unlocked and we’re going to look at improving our tooling to prevent similar errors in the future.**

**/u/MonkfishEsq (Sultan Tarquin, the guy from image post)**
&gt;**Valve actually came through and un-screwed my account. Well there's a turn up for the books.**

Summary of /u/jtraub post on http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1heuz7/warning_russian_users_can_use_an_exploit_to_shut/catnn2x

&gt;An evil guy can send a small amount of money (1-10 roubles) **via QIWI payment system to a person he wants to spite**. All he needs to know to deposit funds is an **account name (login). 1 rouble deposit is a really small amount of money which will be almost not noticeable** if you do not read emails from steam. **After that an evil guy fills a chargeback request with QIWI, Valve recieves chargeback request and automatically locks your account per their poilicies.**

From /u/jtraub 
&gt;It seems, that **the technique is no longer works in a way I described.** Steam automatically converts roubles into currency that is used in your local steam store (USD/Euros), but there is a loophole with this conversion. **An evil guy can add really small amount of roubles to your account** so you may not notice this deposite (as I said previously 1 roubles is ~3 cents) and it will not trigger an alarm in your mind. **After that he claims a chargeback in QIWI payment system, Valve recieves chargeback request and automatically locks your account.** It seems, that policies do not allow support to manually unlock your account.

**From /u/MonkfishEsq (Sultan Tarquin the guy from image post)**
&gt;Yo. Tarquin here. I just figured I'd stop by here to set a few **facts** straight:

&gt;-**My steam login and steam username are different** 

&gt;-**I never gave out my steam login name to anyone** 

&gt;-**I never spent the money that went into my account**

&gt;-**Steam automatically converted the rubles into my currency (GBP. It was 20 pence)**

&gt;Blame me for trolling or whatever. But do you really think telling people using global chat like skype to ""sshhh"" warrants me getting my account transaction banned for 9 weeks?

&gt;Yeah.

From /u/HereForGames (OP on /r/steam)

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/18K9bHV.png Can you add this to the OP of your post? Some people are claiming the guy was trying to sneakily spend the 10 rubles ($0.03) added to his account to make Steam look good, which is outright lying.

&gt;**In that image he's seen contacting Steam support about the rubles on the 27th, well before the account lockdown.**

* **Summary of /u/jtraub post on http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1heuz7/warning_russian_users_can_use_an_exploit_to_shut/catnn2x**

* **Ideas that could fix this issue**

/u/name_was_taken
&gt;**Since only Russian accounts can send money, only Russian accounts should be able to receive money.** It's obviously stupid for it to be any other way.

&gt;That, or **just don't lock the accounts when people give them money.** I can't imagine what kind of situation they're trying to avoid by locking these accounts.

/u/konaitor
&gt;**Or have some form of verification on submitting funds.** (like an accept funds notification, or have them enter account info on sending them)

/u/TheJosh
&gt;Here is your confirmation PIN: 1221

&gt;**Steam notification: You have received funds, please enter the Confirmation PIN.**

&gt;**They do it for emails, why not for payments?**

* **Advice from /r/steam**

/u/Thankarat
&gt;**Don't disclose your account name (login) in the first place.**

/u/jtraub
&gt;If you want your account to be safe from things like this one you should use profile name (nickname) wich differs from your account name. **You should not tell your account name to anyone who is not with steam support.** You should use graphic editor to remove account name from screenshots of your steam/browser (when you are logged in) you post online.

&gt;Do not disclose your acccount name (login) to anyone who is not with steam support. This is really vital measure, because evil-doer who knows **your account name can do a lot of bad things even if he is not from Russia.**

* **NOT Advice**

From me : I just wanted to say sorry if this topic make russian steam users look bad or make them to learn and abuse this exploit. I didnt mean to do that, what I wanted to do is make valve/steam to fix this ASAP and make steam users to more careful with their steam accounts... Im sorry.. (also for my horrible english and reddit formatting)

This was the same reason i quit LoL. Me and my wife even took part in the tribunal but to no avail.  There seemed to be no discernible change in behavior. (Riot games gave an awesome presentation on the effect of the tribunal, but i remain sceptical)

it annoys me a lot that good singleplayer games don't get a high rating from some sites because they don't have a multiplayer or only a lackluster multiplayer.

it doesn't change the singleplayer experience.

and that the cod games have a fun multiplayer doesn't make the singleplayer any better.

something i often read or hear is ""limited replay value"" and they make a big deal out of it.

does a book need replay value, does a movie need replay value ?
it's either awesome or it's not.
do people rate a live concert for it's replay value ?

if we want to legitimize videogames as possible pieces of art, we need to make a separation here.

games get rated like cars from some sites.

What is even the point of making Monopoly without online multiplayer in this day and age?,Red_Inferno,3820,1735,472,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/146hpa/monopoly_released_3_days_ago_on_steam_it_has_no/,"It is a single computer multiplayer game. I had a copy of monopoly over 10 years ago that I got for free from a cereal box that was the same thing. The only difference between that and this would be the graphics.

The reason a lot of people don't play monopoly is because you have to gather friends/family and get them to play for 1-3hrs+ and even then you might not even be able to finish if someone decides to quit. 

I was considering buying it and I had friends considering buying it too since monopoly can actually be pretty fun if you have people who will actually play. When I told them it was single computer they all instantly lost interest.

If you were thinking of buying it I WOULD NOT PAY A PENNY FOR IT. Hell I would not even pirate it. I don't even understand why it even got released on steam since I see 9/10 people who bought it wanting a refund.

edit:
Ya so far most everyone who has bought it is [complaining about the lack of online multiplayer](http://steamcommunity.com/app/221300/discussions).

&gt; As of yet no decisions have been made, but we're thinking about a system that could tell the world's story. The idea is to record everything in original languages, i.e. if we'll meet Mexicans in the game, they'll be taking -- Mexican slang even, portrayed by Mexican actors. The player would be able to buy a translator implant, and depending on how advanced it is, he'll get better or worse translation.

&gt; You can't reliably recreate street slang of Los Angeles or some other American city, you can't simply dub it and reproduce those emotions, rhythm of speech, mannerisms. Everything has to be cohesive. Otherwise we'd simply hear that Polish actors are trying to imitate Americans.

1360293049.0,2060,self.Games,183xqu,I got a bit of validation as an adult gamer yesterday.,ggabriele3,4996,2936,646,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/183xqu/i_got_a_bit_of_validation_as_an_adult_gamer/,"This might be a wall of text, but as I'll explain below, there's really nobody else that would appreciate this story, so I'll write it out.

I'm a lawyer. For those who don't know, this is a profession which does not value one's free time. There's always more work to do. Free time? You could be billing. 4AM is a great time for bosses to get started sending emails, and if you're waiting to 8AM to answer them, you're already 4 hours late.  Most young attorneys I know don't have hobbies at all, apart from the occasional round of golf or fantasy football league. I'm the only one I know that I'd consider a ""hardcore"" gamer. I'm certainly the only person with a Steam library and 350 hours in Skyrim.

Growing up, we had video games, but my parents considered them toys. It's basically the same attitude now - not really a ""valid"" expenditure of time. So the suggestion that I might need some time to myself after work / on the weekends for gaming is poo-poo'ed.

Yesterday, I attended a meeting with our lead partner at one of our major clients' offices. These meetings are very formal, in a conference room with several members of the company, and very high-pressure. My job was to operate the powerpoint presentation i made and basically not say anything. There was some chit-chat about the technology, and one of the guys in the room - a surgeon in his 60s - made a comment that he was a **'master gamer'**. I got the sense that was the kind of thing he probably didn't get to talk about in depth with people often, **so I said ""Surgery Simulator 2013?"" He says ""Black Ops II, 3rd Prestige."" I give him a O_o look and the presentation begins.** I don't say anything else.

**EDIT:** the emoticon i used there was meant to be surprise. if you were in the situation, you'd know what i mean. It was not meant as snarky or elitist. everything was very cordial, which doesn't come across in text.

After the presentation, he says ""you know what? come to my office. let's chat a bit.""  this is a good thing. so we get coffee and talk for a while, and it turns out that he got into video games years ago as a way to keep his hand-eye coordination sharp for surgery. It's apparently getting more popular among surgeons who do endoscopy, since you're essentially using a gamepad/joystick. Then he got hooked and he's a total console junkie, spent a ton of money on a home theater system and a 60'' plasma to play games, and he's a 3rd-level prestige in blops2. I don't play COD (also i'm a PC gamer mostly) but he gave me his gamertag and wants to play. 

So, for a good amount of time, my boss sat there with nothing to say while I chatted with the client, and the client explained to my boss why it's fun / cathartic / relaxing to play games where you shoot people. His gamertag is hilarious, but obviously I can't post it here.

The guy ended the meeting by saying that he actually wanted to get home because he had pre-ordered Dead Space 3. In the car, my boss said ""well i guess now you have to start playing Black Ops"".

Just a very unexpected, very positive experience.

**EDIT:** Since this made the front page, I want to give a little bit more context. As I said above, I wasn't being snarky or elitist when I initially spoke to him about games - it was cordial. He's a really nice guy and we were just joking around. Also, understand that in my world, the baby boomer generation is still the overwhelming majority. Most conversation centers around golf, football, and baseball. It's rare that you have an in-depth conversation about tech (although this is happening more often) or gaming (other than mobile games), so this was a pleasant surprise. And by ""adult"" I was referring only to my age, not my personality.

Also: not that playing Black Ops is a bad thing. I stopped playing COD games because I didn't have time to keep up with everyone else. As free time became rare, I switched to single-player games that didn't matter when or how long I played them.",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,1360323870.0,,,True,t3_183xqu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/183xqu/i_got_a_bit_of_validation_as_an_adult_gamer/,

I encourage people with concerns about different companies and online platforms to seek answers. You don't have to rely on hearsay or wait for someone else. The companies are there to serve you, that's what you give them money for. The ""why bother, they're all the same"" attitude is self-defeating and unproductive.

The game was split into 4 discs, with the first three being the main story adventure and the fourth a special compilation disc of sorts.

The game's first disc is the only one that was officially translated and brought outside Japan, which saw limited success. The fans who bought this game fell in love with it, but only to have their hearts broken when SEGA of Japan announced that the last three discs would not see any overseas release.

Flash forward 14 years and you see a team of hardworking fans who've successfully translated the remaining parts of the series, in spite of the Saturn's extremely difficult programming methods. 

Fans have been recording their playthroughs with commentary for years now, some with the fan translation, some without, and here is where our story takes a turn.

Videos of Shining Force games have seemingly been targeted recently, with several users being threatened with permanent account bans. 

The video selection seems to be random, with some users playing the official English version of disc 1, some people playing official Japanese versions, and some with the fan translation. People with commentary and without commentary have been hit equally. Let's Players who've used an HDPVR have been flagged just as much as people playing via emulation. The videos themselves are being flagged in various parts of the games, not specific scenes or screens. Many of the producers don't even have their channel set up for monetization, let alone these specific episodes.

Popular YouTube game critic TotalBiscuit has even had his videos flagged, and while they are now gone, it's not clear if they were removed by YouTube or voluntarily by TB to avoid further issues. The copyright flagging of TB's videos has already caused him an issue, he isn't able to upload unlisted videos to his primary channel as a result of it.

Many others have voiced their concerns at Shining Force Central, widely considered to be the primary site for Shining fans.

[In this thread](http://forums.shiningforcecentral.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=23541), uploaders have reported that their entire channels have been shut down for posting episodes of a game over a decade old.

For many fans, this seems to be the straw that's breaking the camel's back. It is difficult to remain objective for me, but I don't understand the reasoning behind this attack on fans. This game has never been re-released, and the majority of viewers are in countries that never actually saw the games released in the first place. Why work so hard to destroy what is causing you absolutely no harm?

**EDIT** In addition, several Shining series fans made videos recording *themselves*, not a game, just appearing on screen stating how much they'd like new installments of the games. These videos have *also* been flagged for copyright infringement, *even though no game is actually played in the video*, just the person's appearance and voice.

**EDIT** 11/20/2012, 4:01 PM CST

TB's been tweeting.

‏@Totalbiscuit
Also Youtube have denied the counter-claim on the Shining Force LP. Someone at SEGA has essentially gone nuts it seems

@Totalbiscuit
Old Shining videos from SF3 and Shining the Holy Ark are being targeted for no apparent reason, some people have had channels shut down

@Totalbiscuit
Looks like TGS is going to have to get serious on this and go directly to Youtube to find out what the hell SEGA is playing at

(Somebody asked him if it was someone just posing as a Sega employee)

@Totalbiscuit

@Delixe it's sega, comes from a sega email address



**EDIT** 12/04/2012
A LOT of people are speculating that this is somehow related to the upcoming release of Shining Ark, I'm still not entirely convinced. There still has yet to be any official word from SEGA of Japan, and SEGA of America, Inc has basically admitted ignorance of the entire situation. Any articles claiming that this Search Engine Optimization was the cause is pretty much just guessing at this point.

This prompted me to look into a few other things as well, and I found a couple more that had been abusing the system to try to increase attention for their projects/sites. So today I want to talk a little bit about what I've been seeing, and why it's not allowed on reddit (it's actually one of the few things against [the site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules)).

**What is vote-manipulation, and how can you spot it?**

Let's demonstrate with a particularly egregious example. [Here is a screenshot of *some* of the comments that one user posted on Kickstarter over the weekend](http://i.imgur.com/r94iu.png) (a regular user, not a project creator), and he's even posted many more similar comments since the time this was captured. A few aspects of it that make this not just innocent sharing of links:

* Specifically telling people to go upvote something you're associated with (especially if it's your own submission).
* Even worse, telling people to *register a new account* just to upvote.
* Saying things like ""Please help defend"" and ""Keep an eye on the naysayers"", asking people to help suppress any criticism.

This is obviously an extreme example, but even less blatant ones can be noticed by looking at the *intent* behind why someone is sharing a reddit link. Unless it's a self-post, there's generally not a lot of reason for people to be sharing the reddit submission instead of the destination link itself, unless they specifically want to point out something in the comments.

So for example, if you see someone tweet something like ""Getting a lot of great feedback about my game on reddit here: &lt;link to reddit&gt;"", that's perfectly fine. But something like ""Take a look at the new trailer for my game! &lt;link to reddit&gt;"" probably means they're fishing for upvotes, since they could have just linked the trailer directly. And of course, if they directly *ask* for upvotes there's really no question about it.

**Why is vote-manipulation bad?**

When people have their submission removed due to vote-manipulation, they often respond quite angrily and pull out all sorts of strange arguments like, ""reddit should be happy that we're bringing in extra traffic!"" So I want to address why exactly it's a problem and isn't allowed.

First of all, it's important to understand [How reddit Works](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html). reddit is ""an engine for creating communities"", and the idea is that submissions inside each community (subreddit) will be ranked based on the community's opinion of them, expressed through the voting system. But when a group of people do a drive-by on the votes for one particular submission, that's not really *the community* participating any more, just random people with reddit accounts. One of the greatest things about reddit is how easy it is to join and start participating immediately, but unfortunately this also makes it just as easy for people to join for the sole purpose of abusing the system.

Another major factor is how the ranking system on reddit works. Submissions are ranked on a combination of two factors: their score (upvotes - downvotes), and how long ago they were submitted. One thing a lot of people don't realize is that the score factor is *logarithmic*. That is, in terms of effect on the post's ranking, the first 10 points are worth exactly the same as the next 90, and then the next 900 after that. So the first few votes on a submission are the most important by far. Also, each order of magnitude in score is equal to a 12.5 hour difference in submission time. So a post with 100 points will have exactly the same ranking as one with 10 points submitted 12.5 hours later.

Combined, this means that if a post receives a burst of upvotes shortly after being submitted, it will rise extremely quickly. By submitting a post and then immediately soliciting upvotes via Twitter, Facebook, etc., someone can cause that submission to shoot up the ranks much faster than would normally be possible. So not only do you have people not involved in the community influencing the ranking, but their influence will be especially powerful.

**If you notice it, please report it to the moderators**

Hopefully now it's fairly clear why vote-manipulation is an important issue. The combination of reddit's almost-nonexistent barrier to entry along with the ranking system makes it quite straightforward for outside forces to try to influence post rankings, so we need to keep an eye out for this sort of thing happening if we don't want subreddits to have their content chosen by people that don't even participate in them.

Please look out for anything that appears to be vote manipulation, including:

* Someone sending out links to reddit submissions, especially if they're directly asking for votes.
* A submission that appears to be getting voted up at an unusually high rate right after submission, especially despite negative responses in the comments.
* A submission where the comments are quickly flooded with new users making suspiciously supportive comments like ""Looks great!"", ""Wow, this is awesome!"", etc. (and these comments being upvoted quickly).

If you notice anything like this, please [send a message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames) and ask us to look into it. If you actually saw the vote-solicitation somewhere, please take a screenshot of it and send that as well, since these are often deleted.",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,1354029213.0,,,True,t3_13ti3e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/,moderator

1349375597.0,1864,self.Games,10y64k,"Regarding the ""[Warning: /r/all]"" flair",Deimorz,3105,1241,359,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/10y64k/regarding_the_warning_rall_flair/,"We've had a couple posts in the last day that shot up the ranks fast enough to receive the ""[Warning: /r/all]"" flair, and there have been a few modmail messages and comments asking about it, so I think it's probably a good time to start a post to discuss it.

As of right now, the flair is automatically applied if a post gets above #100 in /r/all. The reasoning behind it is that whenever something gets into the first few pages of /r/all we almost always get complaints about the quality of comments in that post. People post ""what is going on with the comments in this thread?""-type complaints in them, a huge pile of reports shows up on the comments on that post, and we often even get a few modmails telling us that the subreddit is going to hell and that we need to start heavily moderating comments, banning people, etc. This flair is meant to try and head this off a bit by explaining *why* the comments in that particular post are full of reaction gifs and such.

The comments in a post that gets near the top of /r/all shouldn't be used to make any judgments about the state of /r/Games, because the community participating in that post is completely different than the one that participates in almost all of the other posts here. Users coming from /r/all didn't opt in to view the content in this subreddit, they aren't familiar with the subreddit's rules or norms, and they often don't even realize that this is a different subreddit from /r/gaming. [One of the top posts here a couple of weeks ago was largely people complaining about /r/gaming, apparently without even realizing that they were actually in a different subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/101swp/can_we_stop_with_the_im_about_to_start_playing_x/c69t485?context=1).

If there was a way to opt out from /r/all, we would. But unfortunately there isn't any way to do that, so this is going to continue happening with the odd post that rises extremely quickly. This is just one of the challenges of being a popular subreddit. [/r/Games is now the 47th largest subreddit on the site, and is quite consistently in the top 10 non-defaults by number of users online and number of new subscribers](http://stattit.com/r/Games/). Despite that, it's still not common at all for our submissions to reach the top 100 of /r/all. Since I first implemented this flair about a week ago, only 3 posts have received it (and the SimCity one very barely made it). That's far less than 1% of our overall submissions, so I think it's a valuable notification for the rare cases where it does happen.

It is still a bit of an experiment though, so if you have any particular feedback about it, please let me know.

Edit: I've removed the word ""Warning"", which I think was the main problem a lot of people had with it. Posts will still be marked, but not as pretentiously.",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,1349387160.0,,,True,t3_10y64k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/10y64k/regarding_the_warning_rall_flair/,moderator

I solo World of Warcraft and Guild Wars, I only play 1v1 in StarCraft 2, and I've never played Left 4 Dead because it requires a team. In each of these games (and every other one), I only team with the handful of people I know in real life, and that isn't very many.

I was talking to my friends last night about how much they missed City of Heroes when I had this epiphany. I'm really afraid of being the one guy in the group who has no experience -- the one who has to be told what to do and what to expect. I feel like, in a team game, if I'm the one holding everybody back with my inexperience, they're going to get angry or frustrated with me. I want everybody to have fun, and I don't want to feel guilty for getting in the way of that. It feels especially inconsiderate in games like WoW or SC2 where a raid or match can last over half and hour. Why should I waste so much of multiple people's time?

Rationally, I understand that everybody has a first time. Almost nobody goes into a game knowing how to play it ""properly"" right away. We learn through experience. We all have to start some time.

I just can't shake that fear. I honestly don't think it's about ego; I don't really care if anonymous people don't like me. Maybe it has to do with my general dislike of negative environments in real life. In real life, I'm the kind of person who'll just leave or check out when the energy in a room gets uncomfortable or confrontational. I'd rather leave than be confrontational.

Does anybody else feel this way? I want to play in PUGs, have more fun, and make friends, but this is getting in my way. Should I not worry about other people's fun as much? Is this problem common? How do you guys deal with it, if you think about it at all?

UPDATE: Wow, this really took off. It seems a lot of people also feel this way. Also, I'm seeing TONS of encouraging advice and anecdotes from redditors. Thanks so much for all your help and feedback!

We've currently got it set to hide the score of comments for 60 minutes after they're posted. The idea is that this should help reduce ""bandwagon"" voting behavior. Someone will often make a completely reasonable comment about a game that's unpopular (Mass Effect 3, Diablo III, SimCity, etc.), and it will immediately receive a few downvotes from people based on their dislike of the game in question. After that, it's often common for the comment's score to continue dropping, which is probably at least partially due to people seeing that the comment's already been downvoted and just continuing the trend.

In a way, this is basically a different approach to the issue of people misusing downvotes (and hopefully it'll be more effective than when we tried hiding the downvote arrow).

Let us know if you have any feedback about this change specifically, or any other thoughts related to /r/Games's rules/etc. in general. For questions about how exactly the comment-score-hiding feature works and what it effects, please see [the post in /r/modnews about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/).

Edit: Since it's being brought up over and over and over:

### Yes, this works on RES and mobile apps too.

RES and the apps just don't know how to handle something with the score hidden (yet), so they'll show a score of 1 (1 upvote, 0 downvotes) until they've implemented it.

So I just wanted to point out the perspective about why it is such a good idea.

[Check out this developer interview if you have any interest for the game](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/100/feature/7165/Trials-of-Ascension-The-Unique-World-of-TerVarus.html)

If a character had a life span in game, an MMO would offer a much richer experience and would solve many of the problems of todays MMO.

1. Risk vs Reward - If a character lost 1% of their toon's existence for every death for example, then each player's progression will ultimately end at 100 deaths. Suddenly the world is dangerous again. It makes every action much more important and brings back the tension to taking those risks.

2. Casual vs hardcore gamer - This concept works for both. It would be entirely possible for the casual gamer to be one of the most powerful on their server. The Hardcore gamer may reach higher skills quicker, but is also more likely to die an earlier death. So the power gamer does not have as large of an advantage. The slow and steady player can progress their character safer and end up with a very stronger character than the faster and riskier one.
3. End game vs dynamic game play - The developers can focus more on world alteration, rather than some grind for rare loot at the end game. Imagine at the end of a life returning to ""starting areas"" only to find the entire area is different then when you first traveled through. As players play, their actions affect the world around them, thriving settlements are now ghost towns, roads over grown. No two lives would be the same.
4. Guilds/Clans - Would rise and fall organically. A strong guild could lose their leadership to death or a master smith to death. A guild has always been the sum of their members, but what would happen if their two best soldiers died? The world would never follow a stale grind.
5. True need for class/path diversity - With loss of characters, comes a true need for healers, crafters, scouts, politics,.... With death a crafters has a real need to apprentice replacements, a healer is needed to prolong life. Imagine being the only Grandmaster weaponsmith in your area instead of everyone being one after 1 month? ""Yeah, we had a weaponmsmith who could make that, but he died last week. Try the town down south, heard they had a guy.""
6. True accomplishment - How much discovery, power, fame can I earn in my lifetime? Isn't a ticking clock the highest form of motivation. With some sort of acheivment system, a player's life takes on true meaning. Ever play on a new server and get excited about being the first to accomplish anything? I have and it is truly a great feeling, never to be felt again after a month. What if you could set new individual or guild records continually?
7. Solo vs group play - This is similar to casual vs hardcore. Regardless of your playstyle the risk will match the reward, without a race to a stale end game, your progression is your own. You will always be behind and ahead of your peers.  More importantly is to see how much fun the progression can really be.  It is not just grab a ton of quests in an area and kill the same monsters over and over.  Progression is the game and all the risks you take are more immerse.
8. No useless zones - How many times do we see a starting zone packed for a month or two only to become a bunch of quest giving NPCs with no one to talk to? There would not be a need for ""new players"" to keep areas thriving, there would already be a circular mechanic of fresh adventures. As mentioned, by the time a player lives out one life, it is quite possible the world he remembered the first time through is completely altered, always offering ""fresh content."" Even a progressed player would enjoy revisiting where he started helping mentor a friend new to the game.
9. Community - Would receive a huge boost. Imagine a vet asking a newbie where something is or for help progressing because the world he knew was gone? Crafting would mean something even at a very low level because of a new need for gear. This would bridge the vets to the newcomers. Add to the fact the world is dangerous again, and there is a persistant need to help each other out.

So there are my reasons why toons need a lifespan to take MMOs to the next level. I think an MMO would have a good chance at a healthy population of gamers for more than a 6 month run. A game that would challnge and entertain for years.

So what would be the draw backs to this?

See any other benefits?

Disclaimer: I used to be an Xbox 360 fanboy, but as of doing this research I became a major PS4 fan and really harsh on the Xbox One, as my comment history will show. Hopefully this post will show why.

**GPU Raw Power**

So this is pretty simple -- the PS4 has 50% more GCN units than the Xbox One. In layman's terms, the PS4 has a GPU equivalent to a Radeon 7870 and the Xbox One has a GPU equivalent to a Radeon 7790. [Source](http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/156273-xbox-720-vs-ps4-vs-pc-how-the-hardware-specs-compare)

So how do these actually compare? Anandtech has a great benchmark tool that lets us see just that - on identical systems, [here's the difference in frames per second across those two cards on a number of games](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/776?vs=857)

For those that don't want to click the link, it'd break down as follows for say...Far Cry 3 on Ultra:

* Xbox One GPU: 31.7 fps
* PS4 GPU: 49 fps

*PS4 performed 54.5% better than the Xbox.*

EDIT: Some comments are saying the 7790 vs 7870 isn't a decent match up because of the memory bus doubling in the 7870, so here's a [7850 (~1.8 Tflops) vs a GTX 560 Ti (~1.2 Tflops)](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/858?vs=778) which does show closer performance (~20% increase), but suffers from comparing two totally different cards with different drivers.

If you want to see potentially comparable cards in the GTX line, look at the [560 Ti above and the 660](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/858?vs=783) (which has a smaller memory bus, but ~1.8 Tflops), and you're back to around a 43% increase on Far Cry 3.

Edit 2: [A great visual comparison between similar cards](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hawc4/the_power_difference_between_the_ps4_xbox_one/caskv6k)

So this performance increase is pretty significant, and is potentially pretty linear as expected (i.e. the 50% more GCN units results in 20-50% more actual performance).

**CPU performance**

This should be near identical. Both are using 8-core AMD APUs that seem clocked at the same speeds. In fact, because they are both running on x86 architectures, porting between the two and between PCs becomes much easier, and we won't see funky things like the challenges the PS3 cell processor raised that resulted in worse ports of games.

**RAM Speed**

So here things get a bit more complicated, and we need to take a moment to understand the APU architecture.

The AMD APU puts both the CPU and GPU on the same chip. Now, these consoles (as well as the Kaveri chips due Q4), are the first time the AMD APUs offer true unified memory (hUMA), where the shared memory pool allows the CPU and GPU to exchange memory addresses. Previously, while both the CPU and GPU used the same memory pools, if data wanted to be shared between the two, the data had to be copied from the GPU's area in RAM to the CPU's area in RAM. Now they can just tell each other where in RAM things are located, by passing memory addresses to each other. We'll talk more about this later. (If you can't wait, [read this article on ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/amds-heterogeneous-uniform-memory-access-coming-this-year-in-kaveri/) for how awesome this is)

So ok, RAM is shared and it's super-neat. So what?

Well, the PS4 went with all GDDR5 RAM, offering a full 8GB at 176 GB/s.

The Xbox One went with 8GB DDR3 and 32 MB of eSRAM for a throughput of ?? GB/s. Well -- we don't actually really know how fast it will be, as the DDR3 runs at 68 GB/s and the eSRAM could theoretically boost this up to 190 GB/s....but we don't really know, and it's only for those 32 MB (which would be being used as a cache in this case).

How and why does this matter? We know from past benchmarks that RAM speed really matters for the performance of APUs in games.

In [these benchmarks](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/memory-bandwidth-scaling-trinity,3419.html), Tom's Hardware looks at various RAM speeds for an APU and several games. While not the same architecture as the APUs in the consoles, we can see that when not bottlenecked by the GPU computation, an increase in memory throughput of 11.2% resulted in gains of 27.5% for frames per second (using the AvP numbers without any effects -- keep in mind the built in GPU on this APU was pretty crappy, so other numbers are going to be compute limited).

I don't know how hUMA will change these results, or if/where there's a point of diminishing returns for RAM speed based on computational power for the next-gen systems, but faster RAM for the APU's GPU can definitely mean better graphics.

**RAM Latency**

So there's this common response to the DDR3 vs GDDR5 memory that says ""but GDDR5 has higher latency than DDR3."" I'm not sure where this myth comes from, but my guess would be functional tests of latency where the discrete GPU itself is an influencing factor.

* Here's the published latency speeds for GDDR5 from hynix: [PDF](http://www.hynix.com/datasheet/pdf/d...FP(Rev0.1\).pdf) (page 48):
* And for DDR3: [PDF](http://www.hynix.com/datasheet/pdf/graphics/H5GQ1H24AFR(Rev1.0\).pdf) (page 113)

For those that don't care to read the above: the timings are better for GDDR5 than for DDR3.

Clock speed still needs to be known for calculating the latency, so let's figure those out real quick.

Xbox One DDR3 clock speed: 2133MHz

PS4 doesn't have a listed clock speed AFAIK, so we'll do a napkin calculation that hopefully gives us a ballpark estimate: The PS4 is using 16 512 MB GDDR5 chips, so theoretically each module has to support a throughput of ~11 GB/s. Using the number on Wikipedia for [Quimonda's clock speeds for a 512 MB module](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDDR5#Commercial_implementation), the clock speed would need to be around 2750 MHz to support 11 GB/s (at 4GB/s per GHz). We then double that because it's DDR and we get 5500MHz. (thanks /u/luggles !!)

So by all measures, the PS4 should actually have lower RAM latency than the Xbox One. *NOTE: This section's math and figures are the ones I'm least certain about, and I welcome better data.*

**Unified Memory Bonuses**

So remember earlier when we were talking about hUMA and unified memory? Well, Mark Cerny, lead architect of the PS4, had an [AMAZING interview with Gamasutra back in April](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_playstation_4_with_mark_.php).

In it, he talks about using a faster eSRAM (though he talks about eDRAM, which is very similar to eSRAM):

&gt; ""One thing we could have done is drop it down to 128-bit bus, which would drop the bandwidth to 88 gigabytes per second, and then have eDRAM on chip to bring the performance back up again,"" said Cerny. While that solution initially looked appealing to the team due to its ease of manufacturability, it was abandoned thanks to the complexity it would add for developers. ""We did not want to create some kind of puzzle that the development community would have to solve in order to create their games. And so we stayed true to the philosophy of unified memory.""

So what are the neat things the PS4 can do that may be harder on the Xbox One due to the complexity of the memory subsystem? *GPU compute.*

&gt; Cerny envisions ""a dozen programs running simultaneously on that GPU"" -- using it to ""perform physics computations, to perform collision calculations, to do ray tracing for audio.""

That extra 50% of GPU power won't just be for rendering frames - if the GPU is operating at only 80% to render a frame, theoretically the extra 20% can be handling physics calculations, etc. This is huge, as it reduces bottlenecks from the CPU in things like AI or physics. And this depends very much on hUMA to do this successfully.

We have yet to hear detailed tech reports from Microsoft on the hUMA potential. The most recent info was about the eSRAM throughput, which is promising, but I really question if 32 MB is going to be enough for a hUMA architecture, or if the speed of the throughput is at the cost of the flexibility of hUMA. Regardless, even if they do have no issues in hUMA, the worse GPU means there will be a lot less of the GPU left over to take on compute tasks.

Ultimately, the hUMA tasks *could* end up being like the cell programming, where it never really gets used properly except by exclusive games, but it sounds easy enough to manage that it shouldn't be difficult to get at least some performance increases in traditionally non-GPU tasks from the system.

**System Availability**

So the Xbox runs 2 operating systems and a hypervisor to switch between them, and the PS4 only runs one. How does this play out for the games?

* The Xbox One has 5GB of RAM available for the games ([Source](http://gimmegimmegames.com/2013/05/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-os-uses-3gb-ram-5gb-ram-for-games/))
* The Xbox One has up to 2 cores of the cpu (25%) and 10% of the GPU reserved for the system ([Source](http://kotaku.com/the-five-possible-states-of-xbox-one-games-are-strangel-509597078))
* The PS4 has 7GB available for games ([Source](http://www.psu.com/a019055/))
* I haven't found any data for how much of the CPU/GPU is reserved for the system on PS4

So the whole ""switching"" OS aspect of the Xbox takes a pretty big bite out of the already inferior system resources.

**TL;DR**

The difference between these two systems is massive. If you only read one section, look at the 2nd link in the ""GPU Power"" section. 

On every single issue, the PS4 is more powerful than the Xbox One. It's better designed for the unified memory architecture, which will likely be a huge deal in the next few years of game programming. The PS4 has least 50% more power, and the Xbox One is an additional 25% of the PS4's price.

Please understand that the difference between these two systems is MUCH bigger than Xbox 360 vs PS3. The closest system difference I could track down was the difference between the GameCube and PS2 -- you can see [here](http://www.gameswelike.com/web/re/RE%20Comp.htm) how that actually ended up looking for a cross-platform port (Resident Evil). I'm not sure if the differences will be greater now (nearly identical hardware may result in better tuning), or less (diminishing returns on noticeable graphics differences). But the difference is there, and it's not some amorphous thing - the technology checks out.

This watermark includes our ACCOUNT NAME (C:\World of Warcraft\WTF\Account\), the time the screenshot was captured and the IP address of the server we were on at the time. The watermark DOES NOT CONTAIN the account password, the IP address of the user or any personal information like name/surname etc. It can be used to track down activities which are against Blizzard's Terms of Service, like hacking the game or running a private server. The users were never notified by the ToS (as they should) that this watermarking was going on so, for two to four years now, we have all been publicly sharing our account and realm information for hackers to decode and exploit.

###**Official Features**

***

Note: No specifications have been officially finalized but everything below has been officially announced.

* The PS4 allows people to resume games instantly upon turning on the system (no startup time) from where they were when they turned the system off. ([Source](http://www.psu.com/a018423/PS4s-Suspend-Mode-detailed-pick-up-games-right-where-you-left-off))

* All PS4 games (that aren't camera-based) should be playable remotely on Day 1 via Remote Play on the PS Vita. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/18ys2w/sony_exec_ps4vita_remote_play_will_work_day_one/))

* The PS4 will allow users to play games after downloading only a small portion of the game's data. ([Source](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/20/ps4-allows-playing-games-as-theyre-downloading/))

* Gamers can charge the DualShock 4 controller while PS4 is on standby. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/197exn/you_can_charge_the_dualshock_4_controller_while/))

* Share button functionality allows for quick screenshots or video upload of gameplay as well as sharing live streams of gameplay with friends or over USTREAM. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/19326z/people_seem_confused_about_how_the_share_button/))

* Users will be able take remote control of friends games to help them through tough spots and such.  ([Source](http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/20/playstation-4-game-streaming/))

* The system will launch with a headset that plugs directly into the controller for more prevalent voice communication across the PSN. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/18yddw/new_ps4_console_will_come_with_bundle_including_a/))

* Cross-game chat is officially supported. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196eq4/crossgame_chat_officially_confirmed/))

* The PS4 will **not** block used games.  Though publishers are free to do as they wish. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/190uv8/sony_blocking_used_games_on_the_ps4_is_a/))

* Game prices will range from $0.99-$59.99. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/191515/ps4_titles_will_be_99_cents_to_60/))

* All PS4 games will be available as digital downloads. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/191dec/all_ps4_games_will_be_available_as_digital/))

* The PS4 will support Move but not the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

* A PlayStation app called 'PlayStation App' is coming to Android and iOS that allows the device to act as a second screen (a la SmartGlass) as well as purchase content and have it directly downloaded to your system. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/18ycb1/sonys_playstation_app_for_ios_and_android_adds/))  It stands to reason that this will also include messaging on the go and other stuff like that.

* The PS4 will support 4K video output but not for games. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* The PS4 is 3D capable but it is not a focus. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/18yvmy/playstation_4_wont_support_4k_games_3d_not_a_focus/))

* Certain apps can run in the background of games (such as the web browser) so you can access them without having to leave the game itself.  ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/196k7x/the_ps4_allows_for_background_apps_much_like_the/))

**Unsupported**

* **The PS4 is not natively backwards compatible** and thus cannot play PS3 games by default.  However, to remedy this Sony has invested heavily in cloud gaming and hopes to have a cloud-based solution to allow for PS3 games on the PS4 as well as other devices. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/18z56v/ps4_is_not_backwards_compatible_even_with_digital/))

* The PS4 will not support the DualShock 3. ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/192wc9/the_ps4_supports_move_but_not_ps3_controllers/))

**Missing Stuff So Far**

* The System Itself - No biggie.  My guess it will be a black box with stuff in it.

* System Pricing - including if there will be tiered models or a PS Vita bundle.

* Hard Drive Size/Upgradability - What size HDDs will launch with the system and will they be easily upgradable like the PS3?

* Pressure Sensitive Buttons - Are the controller buttons still pressure sensitive like the DualShock 3's were?

* YouTube &amp; Twitter - They were both strangely missing for the apps page in the OS preview and USTREAM seems to be the official gameplay stream site of choice for Sony.  This could mean Xbox is about to announce something big in conjunction with YouTube.  ([Source](http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/02/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-ps4-this-week))  Still, USTREAM does support easy uploading of videos to YouTube ([Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/193e70/can_stuff_from_ustream_be_put_onto_youtube/)) so, as long as there is an easy way to watch YouTube, this shouldn't be a big deal.

1359332640.0,1687,self.Games,17ebak,EVE Online: How exactly a war can cost multiple thousands of REAL dollars. (LONG),jimmysaint13,2452,765,935,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/17ebak/eve_online_how_exactly_a_war_can_cost_multiple/,"Hello, all!

I've been playing Eve on and off (but mostly on) since 2005. With all the hub-bub about the gigantic battle in Eve that recently took place, I've been seeing a lot of the same questions coming up, but some of the ones coming up frequently are how exactly Internet Spaceships can equal so much value in real dollars and what makes certain ships so valuable.

I'll be going over:

* Titans, the biggest, most powerful ships and what makes them exactly so valuable
* Other notable ship classes and values
* PLEX, what they are, and how they give us an accurate Dollars to ISK exchange rate
* What started this huge battle

**--TITANS--**

First off, [take a look at this.](http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=16071218)

That is what's called a Kill Mail for a Titan that was destroyed in that battle. It shows who was piloting it, what equipment was fitted to it, the value of everything attached to it, and who shot at it.

It took 954 pilots to bring it down. Those aren't units controlled on a board like in an RTS, that was 954 real people (maybe take a few for the occurrences of people who multi-box in fleet combat) that shot at that ship to destroy it.

This was the most valuable ship destroyed in that engagement, but there were 2 other Titans downed in that battle worth similar amounts. This particular ship, with all its equipment and cargo, was worth 82.4 billion ISK. At current exchange rates, that works out to roughly $2,300 USD. (I'll explain more on the exchange rate later)

**So what makes Titans so valuable?**

The short version is that they take a massive amount of resources, a long time to build, are difficult to build, and people fit really expensive equipment to them to try and ensure that they don't die.

First off, to build a Titan you need to have a Capital Ship Assembly Array (CSAA). These can only be deployed in Nullsec, or Zero Security space. You also need to control the system you deploy it in. Because they need to be deployed in space, people can delay construction or outright destroy it while it is still building by attacking the Player-Owned Station (POS) that it is deployed under. These factors cover the ""difficulty"" part of why they're so expensive.

Second, they take a while. With perfect skills and the best conditions, Titans take about 8 weeks (real time) to build. That is 8 weeks from the time you load all the materials into the CSAA and give it the blueprint (which costs about 3.8 billion ISK ($100-ish) itself) to time of completion. That is 8 weeks that your enemies have to destroy the CSAA before your shiny new Titan pops out.

Third, the resource requirement is staggering. We're not talking man-hours here, more like man-WEEKS of mining time to get the raw materials to create all the components that you feed into the CSAA. Oh yeah, you have to build or buy the individual components, too. Having a major alliance with thousands of people helps out a lot with this.

Lastly, the expensive equipment. People very routinely fit the best items money can buy to ensure they get the most out of their ship. Remember that Kill Mail I linked earlier? The most expensive module on that ship was worth about 2.3 bn ISK (about $50). The top tier of modules are called Officer Mods and their names start with ""[name]'s Modified [module]."" Officer Mods are so expensive because they drop VERY rarely from difficult sites.

How rare? The sites at which they spawn are generated randomly and require specialized skills and equipment to track down. Once you find the site, the boss the item drops from has a low probability of showing up, and even if he DOES show up, it's a VERY low chance that the boss will drop the item. **THAT** rare.

**But why do you want a Titan?**

Well, on top of their enormous tank and damage-dealing ability, Titans have a couple unique things they can do that no other ship can. The first is the Doomsday Weapon. No seriously, that's what they're called. They're the single most powerful weapon in the game and inflict staggering damage, able to one-shot the lower classes of capital ship.

The second reason why you want a Titan is for their Jump Bridge. Basically, a Titan can open a jump portal to another location that other ships can pass through. You can bridge entire fleets through to another location. This is a massive force multiplier to be able to put a fleet a few solar systems away instantly. Relatively smaller alliances might have a single Titan that never sees combat and is used *solely* for it's Jump Bridge.

So yeah, Titans are a pretty big deal.

**--OTHER NOTABLE SHIPS--**

There are 4 classes of Capital ship. From largest to smallest, these are Titans, Super Carriers, Dreadnoughts and Carriers.

**Super Carriers** - Worth 20 to 25 bn ISK ($650 to $730). Not *quite* as hard to kill as a Titan, but still tough. What makes these special is that they can deploy Fighter and Bomber Drones and control more drones at once than any other ship class (20 drones active at once). They also are the only ship class that can use a Remote ECM Burst module. A Remote ECM Burst will target a single ship, then set off an AOE centered on that ship that has an extremely high chance of breaking targeting locks on every ship it effects. This ability can turn the tide of battle in a hurry, especially if a Burst gets centered on the Logistics (healer) group. Remote ECM Burst and their capital-killing Bomber Drones are why you want Supercarriers.

**Dreadnoughts** - Worth 3 to 5 bn ISK ($100 to $150). Damage output, through and through. Dreads specialize in hitting targets either their size or larger, so they are mostly useful for smashing Player-Owned Stations and larger capital ships. Dreads can go into Siege Mode which vastly increase their damage output and tank, but they can't move while Siege Mode is active and they cannot be targeted by friendly forces to receive repairs and power. The catch is that a ""cycle"" of Siege Mode lasts 10 minutes and cannot be interrupted. If you go into Siege Mode, you're stuck until it's over.

**Carriers** - Worth around 2 bn ISK ($60). Logistics (healer) powerhouses of the game. These ships specialize in repairing shields and armor and supplying capacitor power (used to run your modules) to other ships. Carriers can enter Triage Mode which boosts repair rates and capacitor power generation, boosts tank, and also sensor strength, making it harder for enemies to break it's target locks. But, like the Dreadnought's Siege Mode, while Triage Mode is active the Carrier cannot move and cannot receive repairs or power from allied ships and Triage Mode cannot be de-activated early. Triage Mode's cycle time is 5 minutes.

**Battleships** - Worth around 300 million ISK ($8). Battleships make up the main damage group of any large fleet. They're relatively cheap and expendable, but losing masses of them can still add up. Battleships have no special abilities, but are the largest and hardest-hitting Sub-Capital ships.

**Battlecruisers** - Worth around 70 million ISK ($0.80). If you want cheap, disposable damage-dealing ships, Battlecruisers are your go-to ship class. No special abilities, but you still see them very frequently on the battlefield due to their cost-effectiveness. Battlecruisers are one step down from Battleships in terms of size.

Below Battlecruisers you have Cruisers, Destroyers, and Frigates.

**--PLEX, WHAT THEY ARE, AND EXCHANGE RATES--**

PLEX stands for Pilot's License EXtension. A player may purchase a PLEX with real money and receive a code in their email. When they get this code, they can redeem the code in-game for an item to sell on the market for ISK. Another player may buy this PLEX off the market and use it to extend their play time by a month. A month of game time is $15 USD, so 1 PLEX = $15 USD. 

PLEX effectively allow a player to pay for their game subscription with in-game currency.

Currently, PLEX are selling at an average of 550 million ISK. So, $15 = 550 mil. This price can fluctuate wildly. The lowest I can remember seeing it was about 300 mil, but I've also seen it as high as 700 mil.

**--THE HUGE BATTLE--**

Most estimates I've seen gauge the damage done in that battle (total losses from both sides) at around 630 billion ISK. This comes out to about $17,200. So... what the hell happened?

Dreddit (the Reddit-formed Eve Corporation) and Goonswarm (originating from the Something Awful forums) are at the heart of it. In the Long-Long-Ago, when Dreddit was new to Eve, Goonswarm blew them up to find them coming back in Rifters (tiny frigate ships) and basically anything they could fly to keep up the fight. Goons thought this was adorable and offered Dreddit their help and friendship.

Fast forward through a lot of wars and operations together and about 3 years.

Goonswarm now heads up the ClusterFuck Coalition (CFC) which is made up of Goonswarm, Razor Alliance, Fatal Ascension and a handful of other allied alliances. 

Dreddit is head of Test Alliance Please Ignore, an alliance which heads up the HoneyBadger Coalition (HBC) which is basically TEST and another alliance named Pandemic Legion. Pandemic have had a long reputation of being the PVP Badasses of Eve. Pandemic's claim to fame is not only being one of the best mercenary alliances in the game, but being one of only two alliances to win 3 consecutive Alliance Tournaments. Pandemic has **LOTS** of capital ships, but not a hell of a lot of sub capitals. TEST has assloads of sub capitals. It's a mutually beneficial relationship. One rule of fleet composition is that you NEVER, NEVER, EVER field capitals without adequate subcapital support. That's why the TEST-Pandemic relationship works.

1350234797.0,1682,self.Games,11gtdd,Could we start using the term 'Expansion Pack' again?,StezzerLolz,3679,1997,721,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/11gtdd/could_we_start_using_the_term_expansion_pack_again/,"There was a time, many years ago, when dinosaurs walked the earth and flowering plants were a novelty. Slightly less long ago, and rather more relevantly, there was a time when, upon creating new content for a game they had already released, developers would brand it an 'expansion pack' and sell it to customers for bonus profits.

Those were the glory days, of course, when FPS protagonists weren't strapped to corridor-bound snails, before EVE Online and WoW had driven every other MMO to extinction, when the term 'hardcore gamer' was still a tautology. Nowadays, though, things are different. Nowadays, the gaming landscape has changed, and, as the demographic of gamers has grown at the expense of it's fanaticism, publishers have learned to nickel and dime us for every feature they can withhold. Gone are the days of expansion packs, now the digital shelves of Steam and Origin are stocked with 'DLC', a term with far less positive connotations. For, as every hardcore gamer knows, deep in their heart, every bit of DLC is really just a fragment of content, that was rightfully ours anyway when we bought the game, taken away by the evil publishers so they can charge us extra, for far more than it's worth.

But, let's be honest here, that's not true, is it? It's not true, and it's not fair to the decent and excellent bits of DLC that *are* out there.

And so I'd like to ask a question of you, r/Games; Could we start using the term 'expansion pack' again? As far as I can see, the term 'DLC' has been irrevocably associated with the wrong things, and I feel like this is a mistake. I think it's time we started to separate the two terms, and gave them separate meanings. Different in what way? To be completely honest, it all comes down to quantity.

Let me give you an example. Look at the Borderlands franchise. Whether or not you like the games, it is certainly fair to say that Gearbox has got the DLC for them right. For the first game, there ended up being four separate pieces of DLC; The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Claptrap's New Robot Revolution. Each of those was a huge, sprawling set of new content, involving, basically, an *entire new campaign*. That's not DLC. Those are Expansion Packs.

On the other hand, for Borderlands 2 Gearbox has already released a new class as DLC, the Mechromancer. Regardless as to whether or not you like it or think it's worth the money, that doesn't qualify for an expansion pack. It's simply not enough new content, it won't lead to *that* many extra hours of playtime. It's DLC, and that's all it is.

I know this may seem nonsensical to many of you. Many of you will probably be thinking to yourself, ""but DLC simply stands for 'Downloadable Content', it means almost exactly the same thing as 'Expansion Pack'"". This is true. But the plain and simple fact is that, due to the simplicity in the age of digital distribution of creating and shipping new content, it's become impossible to tell whether any new set of content is merely a couple of new guns or a massive twenty hour campaign. And, frankly, I'd like to be able to tell which it is when someone mentions it, and whether I should be OK with spending $5, $10 or $20 on it.

So, what do you say? Are people willing to make an effort to use this distinction? It would certainly be useful, but sufficiently so that people will actually change?",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_11gtdd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/11gtdd/could_we_start_using_the_term_expansion_pack_again/,

This morning I was glancing at reviews, seeing what other people thought and I stumbled across something in the Kotaku review that made me very unhappy and feel like a big reveal in the game was ruined. There isn't any sort of spoiler warning attached to the review either which kinda pissed me off. Sooooo, if you don't want to have any important plot details ruined: Don't read the kotaku review. The offending sentence is below for anyone interested so SPOILER FUCKING WARNING

Edit: Fuck, this blew up. I'm sorry to the people who opened it in RES and saw the spoiler anyway. I don't know how to fix that so I'm just deleting it, if you want to know just go to kotaku (don't) and read the review.

I am an admin of /r/AgeOfMythology and it has been my quest to tell people that AoM *is not dead*. Ever since ESOs closure, everyone thought that titles such as ~~AoE3~~(not Aoe3) and AoM have been left for dead.

However, this is definitely not the case. The games have been abandoned by the developers, but have been picked up by the fans. 

Ensemble Studios Online's closure means that an official multiplayer server has been denied to the fans. So, the fans embraced two different third party programs called Voobly and Gameranger. At their peak, both programs (at once) sport approximately 600-1000 Aom'ers.

We at /r/AgeOfMythology use Voobly in order to play games with each other, host tournaments, and organize events. We chose Voobly due to its relative superiority and features over GameRanger.

We have currently boosted the AoM community's active readership by nine hundred people. 


**Some background about Age of Mythology for those who have never played** :

Age of Mythology is a real time strategy game. It is based around the ideas of Age of Empires and it combines it with ancient mythology. It can teach you about ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythologies in an interesting way.

In my biased opinion, I believe AoM is better than StarCraft. I won't go too much into it because [it has been argued](http://www.reddit.com/r/AgeofMythology/comments/1e5ukn/starcraft_2_vs_aom_discuss/) on /r/AgeofMythology. ;D

If you need any more information I'll be happy to answer questions to my best ability.

1357983928.0,1662,self.Games,16fjon,"I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life, and I was role playing as Hitler the entire time.",GoldenJoel,3479,1817,384,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16fjon/i_just_had_one_of_the_best_gaming_experiences_of/,"(No racism or anti-Semitic behavior involved.) 

I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life on a Garry's Mod server.

A little information to explain:  On Garry's mod, there are a number of servers under the label of DarkRP.  RP servers are kind of infamous on Gmod.  Players can set up little businesses, be involved with the police or crime, or even become mayor of the entire town.  The server I was playing on was a WW2 Occupation themed server, and I just so happened to land the role of The Fuhrer, in charge of the entire Reich army.

How I got this position was merely luck.  Players have the opportunity to vote for positions they'd like to hold.  Each player can vote yes or no on that request.  It gets kind of cluster fucked at times, because people will get demoted for legal and illegal actions in the game.  The basic rule is that Nazis can't fire on Resistance without cause.  If they find a resistance member suspicious, they can search said member and then jail him.  The system is a bit flawed and easily abused, but it works in a weird way.  

So anyway, I nail the role of Hitler, and thankfully I'm already inside the Reichstag. (The Nazi's Base) I start to discuss what we could do as Hitler with the guy who would become my SS Officer.  I decided that I wanted to give a speech and give the resistance a little event to pop a shot at me. 

I have the SS Officer set things up, and I update the agenda with details on my speech.  I also type out a little advert for everyone in the server, giving the resistance the word.  Eventually, the speech was ready to give, and about  15-20 players (There are 50+ in the server at times) followed me out to the courtyard steps as I prepped my speech.

I opened up youtube in steam and mic spammed one of Hitler's speeches, and all the players who were playing German troops started taking pictures of me with the camera tool.  In terms of RP events, it felt pretty legit.

I didn't hear the shot, but soon everyone began to panic.  My SS Officer and Kommandant escorted me from the podium, running back into the Reichstag through the garage.  From the garage, I ordered for my troops to look for the assassin and I initialized a lockdown.  A lockdown is a state of gameplay where the streets are supposed to be cleared by civilians and resistance.  German troops basically institute a curfew and either arrest or shoot violators on sight.
This is where the real meat of the session began.  I began to give more and more orders from my office, establishing a relatively stable rule for the Reich.  This kind of pissed off the Resistance and Citizens outside.  The tone of the server seems very anarchic at times, so with the Reich having order it seemed to really swing things around.  Thing is, a lot of kids come on the server as well.  You know the type, young 12-15 year olds shooting people at random and calling them faggots or whatever.  Thankfully, my SS Officer and Kommandant kept them in line.  I had a lot of requests and meetings as my short time as Fuhrer.  Some were to report suspicious activity, others were just requests for orders.  I eventually began to get overwhelmed and told them to report to the SS or Kommandant for orders.

I didn't stay Hitler however...

At one point, the server crashed.  This meant everyone had to reset their roles.  I lost my role as Fuhrer temporarily, but the person who took it was rather entertaining.  He went by Krieger, and he was a German-Speaking player ONLY.  That's right, we had a Fuhrer that could not speak a word of English in charge of the entire Reich on a ENGLISH server.  The SS Officer and I found this quite hilarious, and tried a number of ways to communicate with our new leader.  We started posting adverts and requests for other German speakers who could translate, but eventually decided that it was too difficult.  The Fuhrer left the Reichstag and started to walk about.  The SS Officer and me began asking random people on the streets if they could kill The Fuhrer.  Most thought we were trying to bait them, but when we explained the situation it led to laughter.

Eventually he was killed and I was placed back in power.  I continued my business as usual.  I tried to be as fair as possible, (I issued lotteries, asked for my troops to request warrants before entering buildings, etc.) but things began to push against me.  I got snippets of information from my Gestapo agent of gathering forces at a bar down the street.  I sent my troops to investigate, and it eventually led to a series of skirmishes in the streets.  A number of battles occurred in the slums and at the bar across the street.

There was one famous skirmish inside a warehouse.  My SS Officer alerted me that the resistance had holed up inside the building, popping shots off at patrolling Nazis.  I gave him permission to assault the warehouse.  During that time, I met a guy RPing as a doctor.  He healed me during a assassination attempt, so I paid him well and kept him close.  He also acted as a spy for me, reporting from the battlefield of the opposition.  I began to trust him, allowing him inside meetings with the High Command.

The leader of this opposition, as far as I knew, was a man by the name of, ""The Bastard"" (Not his actual name but close.  I don't wanna give anyone unwanted attention.)

The Bastard used shady and rule-breaking tactics to try and get at me.   Unfortunately, it was effective and he managed to gather a number of followers.  There's a ""New Life Rule"" that everyone is supposed to follow, and he broke it a number of times.  I recall a time where he was imprisoned and one of my guards, against my orders, executed him.  He spawned back in jail, and in good faith I had him released.  He was still in the Reichstag when this happened, and drew his gun the moment he was able.  This led to him being gunned down by 6 of my men, again...

After a while, The Bastard began to get closer and closer towards the Reichstag.  I got reports of opposition right outside The Reichstag as well as rumors of a distraction attack to lure troops away.  Bastard's final push got the best of me though.  I had mistakenly allowed a man, who I foolishly assumed was another Gestapo agent, to breach my inner circle.  He let the resistance in, and I holed myself up in my office with a small group of troops, my doctor, and a personal friend whom I had made on the server.  We three hid in the corner as my troops fought with the overwhelming opposition, but they eventually broke through and killed us all.

So ended my rule as Hitler.  I may go back to owning a Soviet Spy base disguised as a bar.

---tl'dr Played as Hitler in a WW2 RP mod, ran things as a legit leader.  Gave speeches, issued orders and initiated lockdowns.  Eventually killed by resistance.  One of the best gaming times of my life.---


QUICK NOTE:

To those asking for the Server name or IP address, I'd rather not give it out.  I don't have any permission by the admins to plug the server, and I'd rather not give them a reason to handle a wave of people joining all at once.  It might mess with whatever jive they got going.  If you really want to know, just go looking for it on the GMod server listing.  Sorry! ^^

1358620646.0,1649,self.Games,16vx24,The short-lived experiment with hiding the downvote arrow is over - it was a complete failure.,Deimorz,3811,2162,562,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16vx24/the_shortlived_experiment_with_hiding_the/,"A few days ago, [we made several changes to the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16oz7t/200000_subscribers_time_to_experiment_with_some/), one of which was an experiment with hiding the downvote arrow to see what effect it would have (if any) on the number of downvotes being used for disagreement. The mods had a discussion about it yesterday, and we were all in complete agreement that it was a failure. So the arrow has now been unhidden, and I'll be adding a little pop-up reminder to it shortly.

As for why the experiment failed, one factor was that it seems the number of people on mobile applications, using RES, or with stylesheets disabled is high enough that there were still a ton of downvotes being used anyway, so it didn't prevent much. We knew this was a possibility since it was only a CSS modification and not a true disabling of downvoting (which isn't possible), but the only real way to find out how significantly it would affect things was to test it.

I also personally found myself frustrated several times at being unable to downvote posts that contained incorrect information. For example, there were some posts in the thread about Jay Wilson resigning from Diablo III that contained blatantly false info about the game, but because they were negative and the internet hates Diablo III, they were voted up extremely quickly. They had reached scores of about +25 before anyone responded correcting them, and if nobody was able to downvote, those incorrect posts would have had at least 25 points indefinitely. This is not really desirable, and a perfectly legitimate application of downvoting.

And even though the downvote is back, we're still going to continue moderating some extremely low-effort comments, mostly focusing on pointless clutter posted as top-level responses. This has been getting rid of a lot of extremely useless comments that just waste space, and helps keep the threads a little more on-topic.

**FAQ:**

&gt;Can I submit any information about this event in a different thread?

No. We want to avoid this event dominating the entire frontpage and /r/games/new. After the event is over, you can.

&gt;Why are the comments in this thread of such low quality?

Once this thread reaches /r/all, there'll probably be too many comments for us to moderate them efficiently. Sorry.

We let him think that.

&gt;Which is better? Playstation or Xbox?

Yes.

This is a very exciting move in my opinion, and represents a shift even further towards the burgeoning landscape of digital distribution, and away from (what I believe to be) a much more archaic ecosystem in physical brick-and-mortar retail.

What do you guys think? Got any speculation, or want to extrapolate further based upon this news? I hope to generate some great discussion about this topic!

I have friends, but almost none of them play any games. If they do play games, it's limited to occasional Facebook or iPhone games. In fact I had a friend that was confused as to why there are new consoles (after I explained E3 to him). 

I only know one other buddy who might be interested in playing something like The Crew with me. But he is married and we both work until 8 or 9PM almost every day. The weekends are equally busy

Looking at some of the games shown this E3, I seem to see a trend in which games are moving towards being social and mixed. Be it Destiny, Titan Fall, The Crew, or Splinter Cell Blacklist, it seems like games are now starting to expect that you have a crew of buddies at your beck and call to play games with. Even something like Watch_Dogs, I fear, won't be fully enjoyable without some friends.

I'm kind of sad that people like me are going to be left behind. I'm sure there will be games that don't require this, but I'm afraid of it all moving this way.

Thank you everyone for helping us get Steam's immediate attention to the theft first and foremost! Now let's see if this flaw has also been dealt with.  
  

**TomB of Valve has posted this on my main Workshop thread:**  
&gt; Workshop authors can ban users from the discussion areas for their item only. However, it looks like that ban is affecting users in the Skyrim Discussions area (at the very least in the UI with a ""banned"" string next to the user's name). I've un-banned the affected users and will look at fixing the error.

&gt; I've also given SupernaturalKath a Steam Community ban and banned all their Workshop items.  
  

**Mod note:** Please **DO NOT POST HER PERSONAL INFO** This thread was never meant to start a witch-hunt of her. [Reddit Mods have already spoken on this issue are issuing bans](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1a0qun/flawexploit_in_steams_workshop_discussionforums/c8t5rg0)  

This all started with a Skyrim mod thief called [SupernaturalKath](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067483616/myworkshopfiles/?72850)(dealt with and banned from Steam Workshop and Community pages) being found out to have stolen *many* mods. This includes the popular Skyrim mod - [Footprints](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22745) originally made by **jownd7**  

**jownd7** contacted SupernaturalKath on the mod's Discussion page. He also posted a list of all the stolen mods SupernaturalKath has taken in the main Workshop Discussion Page - [Skyrim Workshop content theft](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/-1/864961721852325280/)  

Additional information given by other users later, have discovered she has stolen over 20 mods, most of which are still on her profile.   

On her stolen Footprints mod Discussion page, SupernaturalKath was able to **edit the original post by jonwd7**  

[The Edited original post and her reply](http://snag.gy/DxGax.jpg) - 
Note the Edit by-line of 'SupernaturalKath' and how she replied just 2 minutes later after the post became 'favourable'. Note that the edited post does not match jon's writing style.  

Even more alarming, she was able to **ban him for 24 hours from ALL Elders Scrolls Discussion pages** - http://i.imgur.com/ZqYTDok.png  

After I posted a comment on her stolen mod page, she removed my comment and banned me from further posting in her mod pages. She also removed the edited Discussion post, when she realized how damning it was.  

Furthermore, she has now been able to **PERMANENTLY** ban ~~jownd7~~ any dissenting users who posted in comments on her mod pages, from all Elder Scrolls Skyrim Discussion pages on Steam - http://oi50.tinypic.com/2dvqxvs.jpg  

Cited reason by her as 'being a spy'  

What started as an investigation into mod theft has now clearly revealed a HUGE exploit/flaw in Steam's mod author powers, allowing them unlimited Edit-Post and User-Ban powers that should NEVER be in the power of a common user.   

Please see here for more information about SupernaturalKath's mod-theft and evidence of her access to higher level mod powers:   
  

**Ongoing discussion about mod theft and correspondence with jonwd7 (locked, please see new main investigation thread)** on the [Bethsoft forums]( http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1349500-mod-stealing-and-recopying/page__st__120) 

**New main investigation thread** - [Bethsoft Forums](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1448749-mod-stealing-copying-thread-2/) (includes ongoing tests to see where the exploit lies. More or less confirmed.)  

**Discussion thread of her mod theft started by jonwd7 on the** [general Steam Workshop forum, which he can still post in]( http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/-1/864961721852325280/)  

**Discussion thread about her and her abuse of mod powers on the** [Steam Skyrim Workshop Discussion forum]( http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/-1/846947320682556820/?appid=72850) started by me  



Please upvote this for visibility. This exploit has far worse potential then just allowing mod thieves to get away scot-free!  

This is being x-posted to other subreddits as well.

Edited for clarity. Do not be alarmed to see my Steam account listed as 'banned' on my Discussion thread. It's part of a test between Bethsoft forum users to determine the exploit/flaw.

**Edit2:** SupernaturalKath is apparently online as multiple people are saying they are currently being banned from Skyrim Workshop Discussion forums the moment they comment on her mod pages with links to this page.

Another user banned after linking this reddit page: http://i.imgur.com/tf7Kssu.jpg

**Edit3:** jonwd7 was approached for comment for this article on [BeefJack](http://beefjack.com/news/steam-workshop-user-found-editing-and-banning-users-amid-accusations-of-uploading-stolen-mods/)

Woah this seems to be getting big, didn't think even one digital article would come out of this.

Also I'm aware of the doxxed information being posted. Please, she's a thief, and an ass-hole, but I'm still against doxxing. The post aim was to a) get her off the Skyrim Workshop and b) make Valve react to fixing this ASAP. I've notified the moderators about the info, please do not repost it.g",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,1362968246.0,,,True,t3_1a0qun,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1a0qun/flawexploit_in_steams_workshop_discussionforums/,

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

**First of all on the background concerning the Honey Badger Coalition and Cluster Fuck Coalition while trying to avoid writing a novel.**

Back in the day when Dreddit was first starting out in EVE they stumbled upon the Goons during a mining operation when someone misread the map and ended up in the wrong end of the universe. Upon stumbling on Dreddit the Goons destroyed them in short order. However the Goons were impressed with Dreddit's balls and decided to extend the olive branch and help them build their space empire. Fast forward a few years and now Dreddit is at the head of TEST Alliance Please Ignore (alliances being collections of corporations) which is at center of the HBC (coalitions being collections of alliances).

For several years the CFC and HBC worked together towards shared goals. Generally these goals were simply taking space from lesser alliances and destroying their enemies but notably one of the more meta gamey things they accomplished was OTEC. OTEC is a cartel that controls an extremely limited resource in the game that is vital for construction of advanced modules and ships. As can be expected everyone participating in the cartel grew rich and bloated beyond reason. Prices and markets were and continue to be manipulated across the universe and holding TECH moons is the goal of any would be alliance.

This very same cartel, however, has a downside. All these allies grew so rich that no one could contest them, this lead to some stagnation. As demonstrated in the summer/fall of last year during the last joint campaign between the HBC and CFC the Southern Coalition was utterly destroyed and evicted from their home space. During the sovereignty transfer of this space relations between the CFC and HBC broke down as the CFC left before the job was finished, leaving the heavy lifting for the HBC. Words were said, many of them not so nice. 

**as pointed out by /u/webo** 

*The HBC asked the CFC to come bail them out after losing a huge fleet fight. It was arranged that the CFC would get some space (the W4 constellation in Delve, among others). The CFC + HBC together broke the back of the Southern Coalition pretty much immediately, so there really were no ""goodfights"", just sov taking. Then, HBC said ""we don't want you to have any space because we don't need your help"".*

*Why would the CFC stay? They aren't getting what they were promised, and their help is no longer wanted in the fight. The HBC literally told the CFC to stop helping them take space, so the CFC went home.*

**Montolio's take on the same situation (/u/Kavok)**

*They wanted some systems for 'defense of the region' - we wanted to handle defense ourselves. We offered to give them NOL-M9 as a symbolic gesture and some resource moons as payment for help. They declined the moons but took NOL-M9. Relations soured further after the transfer and we were given NOL-M9 back when the CFC went back north and pulled out all strategic assistance.*

Since then relations have been strained with things escalating slowly. In order to reduce workloads some allies had standings reset so that they could shoot each other without consequence. There was in effect though a No Infrastructure Pact between all parties. The NIP prohibited any military action against infrastructure in the form of sovereignty, moons, stations, etc. The TECH cartel wheels would continue to roll.

In the last ~2 months a squad within the HBC known as Sperg has been attacking a member alliance of the CFC known as Fatal Ascension. Reasons for specifically targeting this alliance are somewhat contrived but actions against FA consisted of attacking their members as they generated income or trying to catch fleets off guard. Billions of ISK worth of ships were destroyed before things came to a head.

HBC diplomat in charge of relations between the CFC and the HBC, BringStabity, made some rash comments to the CFC just short of declaring war on FA under the protection of the NIP. Obviously the CFC could not just ignore this threat to their allies so this week following a buildup to all out war it was arranged that all standings between the two coalitions would be reset and each party would be fair game **but** the NIP would remain intact. No sovereignty war would take place and income sources would not be attacked.

[Now we arrive at the battle that took place last night](http://i.imgur.com/MnhLmX4.png) . This battle was beyond the scope of what many were expecting. Super capitals are considered to be borderline infrastructure due to their immense force multiplication. As such this could render the terms of the NIP moot and result in full blown war. However The_Mittani (leader of the CFC) is somewhat notorious for being adverse to risk so it's possible that he may sue for peace and attempt to resume peaceful relations to preserve the TECH cartel. It is known though, that Montolio (leader of the HBC) has been out for Goon blood for a while. It is expected that he will attempt to escalate the war.

**Events that directly lead to the fight last night and a summary**

[For the /r/eve thread that I'm pulling information from and summarizing here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/17ckbk/pl_hot_dropped_goons/)

Last night the Liandri was reinforcing a CFC cobalt moon located in low security space with a capital fleet (I'll expand on why this is important). In response Fleet Commander DaBigRedBoat was given the green light to bring in a capital fleet to dumpster Liandri and protect their moon. This is where the fun begins, the problems began when instead of bridging in the fleet (bridges are deployed by Titans as shortcuts across the map) the Titan pilot accidentally JUMPED to the target location by himself.

Sirens and alarms started to go off across the game, a CFC Titan was vulnerable to attack. Pandemic Legion (of the HBC) was the first on the scene with their own super capital fleet as the CFC was bringing in their own super capital fleet with support to attempt to get everyone out safely. PL held the field for approximately an hour while the HBC put fleets together to reinforce. PL suffered the heaviest losses on the HBC side but they inflicted more than they took before help had arrived, and did help ever arrive. The CFC got word of what was coming and they formed up ready to jump in to help but at the last minute they decided against it. 

The HBC was fully scrambled and had even enlisted the aid of mutual enemies to come shoot the CFC. The CFC could not hope to win a fight against 2500+ people, anyone they sent in would only die as well. They decided to cut their losses and began evacuating the system, leaving behind what couldn't be saved. By the time the HBC arrived in force the battle was already winding down as Titans fled the field and lesser capitals were in their death throes.

Unfortunately for the HBC this system was indeed low security. This means that the Titan's most powerful weapon could not be deployed (the Doomsday) and that interdiction bubbles could not be used. Bubbles would have secured almost twice what HBC ended up killing since they can prevent the escape of ships in a massive AoE. Instead the HBC had to use focused interdiction on individual capitals and hope the interdictors could survive the fight. In the end a handful of dictors were lost and some capitals escaped but many more were destroyed.

Final estimates peg damages at 650 billion done to the CFC and 67 billion to the HBC. (~$20,000 to ~$2000)

For many of these, you will need [Grognak's Mod Manager](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=9994), a very simple and useful mod injection tool. 

Here's the highlights of what I've used so far:

[Starcraft Conversion](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=5238): 18 new Starcraft ships with highly unique abilities

[Serenity Mod](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=3734): Pilot the Firefly class ship from the popular TV show

**[Infinite Space](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=3542)**: This is hands down the BEST mod for this game IMO. Adds infinite replayability by removing the sector eight endgame and the rebel fleet chasing you, and (when it deems your ship ready) replaces them with sector minibosses that can be almost as difficult as the rebel flagship. Each time you defeat one, it will provide you with a quest, the completion of which will yield you a unique weapon/augment/drone. There's much more to this mod, go check it out. 

[FTLedit](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=13773): A great tool for making your own ships

These are just a few, there are dozens more and new ones every day. So don't beat the game and let it languish in your steam library with 5 hours on the counter! For the wonderful price of free, you can extend the game's lifetime to unknown limits. 

Thanks for your time and I hope you enjoy :)

1364173887.0,1525,self.Games,1ay2po,"So I played ""The Last Of Us"" for about a half hour at PAX today, here's some thoughts to interested folks",mingie,2520,995,416,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ay2po/so_i_played_the_last_of_us_for_about_a_half_hour/,"I havent really seen anyone talking about the demo here so I figured I'd throw in my two cents. 

So the main reason I've been excited about this game is that it looks rather hard and the combat has a real feel of 'desperation"" to it (judging from the vids), and after playing the demo I can say I'm still excited for this games release. 

One of the bits of the demo has you clearing out a room so you're companions can move through safely. The room has 4 ""runners"" (stage one zombies that are irritable, move fast, and fight you) and 1 ""clicker"" (sees by sonar, has a mushroomy face, tears your neck out if you get close). 

After getting my face beat in by runners and my jugular torn out numerous times by the clicker I was starting to get a bit self-conscious about my gaming abilities. I decided to mix up my strategy and go for the clicker first since it was causing the most difficulty. 

 Now I had two shivs which I was able to ""craft"" earlier from scissors and cloth which enable you to stealth kill an enemy. It is very important to be quiet in this game. I started the area by taking out one of the runners with a shiv, and then waiting till the other runners left the area that the clicker was in. The only way I could approach the clicker however was head on, which isn't a problem if its not alarmed since it doesn't ""click"" to detect things. However it was still tense as fuck as I'm creeping headlong onto this mushroom zombie hoping it doesn't start to click and hoping the other runners don't come back to my area. 

I'm a few feet from the clicker when there's a squeal from my left as a runner spots me, I bolt away from the clicker fearing for my jugular. I turn a corner and run headlong into another runner which I dispatch with a few punches and a final head slam into a desk. As I turn to see what's behind me another runner barrels into me and I dispatch him in a similar manner. I see the clicker rounding the corner. fuck. I run again. 

I run into a side room and hide low behind a desk hoping to avoid detection but it doesn't quite work, the clicker and runner come bolting in so I take out my 9mm which has but 4 bullets. Get a lucky headshot on the runner and unload the rest into the clickers chest. It recoils back for a bit and then looks very pissed off. fuck again. I take out my revolver which has 2 bullets, aim for its head, BOOM there's a splash of orange its dead... NOPE.. i just shattered off its ""mushroom growth shit"", let loose my last bullet and it finally dies. 

I feel like I barely survived, my heartrate is up and the character joel says in a wobbly voice ""alright its clear"" or something to that effect. The voice ""wobblyness"" lended alot to my experience because Joel is clearly shaken, and I am to some extent as well. I mean, I just barely survived (low health) and used all of my scant resources to do so. 

After this zone there was some more exploring and traversing through a ruined cityscape, I managed to find some more supplies and a baseball bat which allowed me to craft an upgraded baseball bat which had scissors crudely fastened to the end of it. This haggard weapon gave me a sense of superiority, I could do some damage with this thing as simple as it was. So as I'm coming up on another group of enemies the booth folks announce that there's 5 minutes left so I decide to just rush in. I find a shotgun right at the entrance and drop the first 2 runners I see. A clicker starts running up to me and I drive the scissored end up the baseball bat into its neck and give it a sharp pull (at least joel did this, all I did was press X). I managed to take down a good number of them until I had used my 3 shotgun shells and my bat broke, my throat was then swiftly torn out. 

All in all though I really liked how the game was presented. You need to think about your encounters, rushing in will get you killed, and even if you have some sort of more powerful weapon, it certainly won't last so you need to really utilize the best way in which to use it. The game is gorgeous and the voice-acting is top notch, it really adds alot to the tense atmosphere. 

Sorry for the wall of text, got kind of carried a way haha

Ask Me Anything!,JamieFristrom,2396,910,457,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ep0ed/i_invented_the_swinging_in_spiderman_2_now_im/,"Hi everybody! Years ago I was technical director and designer on Treyarch's Spider-Man 2 game for Xbox/PS2/Gamecube - and I was the one who came up with the idea for its swinging system and built the first set of prototypes to prove that maybe it could actually work. (Don't get me wrong: it was a group effort, and wouldn't have been as good without the help of a bunch of other people.) 

Lately I've gotten to miss that game mechanic, and there were things I wanted to do with it that I never got to do, so I'm working on a game called Energy Hook, which is swinging-and-wall-running a la Spider-Man 2 mashed up with extreme-sports-style-action a la Tony Hawk or SSX.

I did a [weird Kickstarter for the project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/551129138/energy-hook-0), with only a $1 funding goal. It's basically a preorder campaign like Overgrowth or Desktop Dungeons is doing, just on Kickstarter. The idea is I'm going to finish this game anyway, but I could always use more funds to make it bigger and better.

Also, the game's on [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=145451414) and could always use more votes!

It's one of the major flaws I've seen with existing tutorials. They get pretty confusing to a new player as they just get too deep into the concepts to be meaningful without having already learned a lot of the stuff they're discussing.

One thing I keep hearing:

DRM will make each game become cheap very quickly. Because, like Steam, the devs/publishers are getting a cut from every copy sold. Also, that used games hurt the devs because of reselling and what not. 

I'm thinking that Microsoft would have already said this to defend their decision if it was true. Thoughts?

Personally, I'm leaning on getting a PS4. I just want to hear the other side speak their mind before I drop that much money on a console.

1353087470.0,1440,self.Games,13b31x,Today is the one-year anniversary of /r/Games's creation - let's talk about the subreddit and how to keep it on track,Deimorz,2248,808,298,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13b31x/today_is_the_oneyear_anniversary_of_rgamess/,"One year ago today, Dacvak, tevoul and I [launched this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/metq6/announcement_rgaming_to_branch_into_two_separate/) as a place for people that wanted a general gaming subreddit focused on informative and interesting content and discussions. If you're curious, [here are the top posts that were made in the first few hours](http://stattit.com/r/Games/2011-11-16/), and [the top ones made over the next day](http://stattit.com/r/Games/2011-11-17).

Over the last year, the subreddit's grown extremely quickly. [Looking at the statistics](http://stattit.com/r/Games/), we're now the 46th largest subreddit on the site by number of subscribers, and are typically around the top 25 by number of users online and number of comments being posted. Considering most of the top 20 is made up of the default subscriptions, this makes us one of the very top non-default subreddits.

Overall, despite this massive growth, I still think the subreddit is mostly doing a good job of staying true to the initial vision. We've had to make some small tweaks to the rules here and there, but nothing very major. And on that note, there's a couple of things in particular that I want to discuss today.

### Game recommendations and other rules

Fairly early on in the subreddit's life, we banned ""overly general"" recommendation requests, posts like ""I just got a PS3, what games are good?"" Beyond that, we mostly allow anything, as long as there's at least something to guide the discussion. So asking for recommendations similar to other games or in particular genres is fine. However, there are still quite a few low-quality recommendation requests being posted, and I know that some people aren't happy about them. I should mention that I don't think they're really a huge issue since they're generally downvoted and aren't dominating the subreddit or anything, but they do clutter up the /new page a bit.

So I'd like to suggest an addition to the rules about recommendation posts, which is to also ban **overly personal or specific recommendations**. For example, ""Should I buy Game A or Game B?"" The answers to this are completely dependent on the poster's personal taste, so they naturally can't cause much of a discussion for others. Since we already ban other types of posts that are just looking for a specific answer (""Where can I buy Game X?"", etc.), I think this also fits in well with that.

Any thoughts on this, or any other changes we should consider to the rules? Like I mentioned, I think the voting system does handle a lot of stuff, everything doesn't specifically need to be dealt with by moderation.

### An experiment in ""community moderation""

But on that topic, the other main thing I want to discuss is an idea I had for a potential experiment. As anyone that spends much time on reddit eventually realizes, the voting system has a lot of weaknesses. Specifically, the biggest problem is that it doesn't rank things based on quality, it ranks by *popularity*, which is often very different. On reddit, whatever gets the most upvotes the fastest is the ""best"", which means a subreddit's content inevitably drifts towards things that are quick to view, easy to understand, and non-controversial. This drift can be managed with moderation, but never truly ""solved"" because it's inherent in the site's entire model.

The experiment I've been considering is one that basically adds another system to allow people that have been actively and positively involved in the community to take a more direct role in how it's moderated. It would be somewhat of a middle ground between being a regular user (where your downvote can be canceled out by anyone else's upvote) and a moderator (where your removal overrules all votes). Here's how it would work:

By scraping data from the subreddit, I would compile a number of statistics on the users here, including when they first participated in the subreddit, how often they post/comment, how well their posts/comments generally do, etc. From those statistics, derive a (large) list of users that are high-quality, regular participants in the community.

Then set up a bot that will perform moderation actions if the action receives enough ""support"" from these users. For example, perhaps each user begins with a weight of 1, and it takes a total weight of 5 to remove something. Then when 5 of the eligible users send a message to the bot requesting a particular post be removed, it takes the action. Other than removals, a few other actions could be supported through this as well, like adding the ""[Misleading title]"" tag that we use. Sending messages to a bot isn't very user-friendly, but unfortunately this is about the only way to add any functionality to reddit.

By using a weight system like this, users could also be adjusted over time (based on their participation statistics and correctness of past messages to the bot) to have more or less weight, so perhaps eventually someone's vote puts 4 weight towards performing an action instead of 1.

Overall, this system would allow users that are more involved in /r/Games to directly help keep the subreddit on track. It would also help deal with those edge-case posts that don't technically break the rules, but seem to be considered low-quality. With this system, if enough of the regular members of the subreddit agree that it doesn't belong, it could be removed.

What do you think? Is this an interesting idea that you'd be interested in at least trying out, or is it just overcomplicated and unnecessary?

And as always, any other feedback about the subreddit is welcome.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,1353087839.0,,,True,t3_13b31x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13b31x/today_is_the_oneyear_anniversary_of_rgamess/,moderator

I was watching some random top ten videos on youtube (which I do not take very seriously) and came across this [Top Ten Ridiculous Video Game Boss Battles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN0o9HpnL9I&amp;t=5m40s) when one of the comments the narrator makes struck me as quite thoughtless.

It was in regards to the Big Mighty Poo boss battles in Conker's Bad Fur Day.  He says:

""This is still the best example of video games as art that we have to date.""

Uh, what?

That's just sad.

Ok, seriously, I get it.  The opera singing poo had everyone in stitches.  It's hilarious. It's clever. The more elaborate the fight became, the more seriously it took itself, the funnier the battle got. I get it.

But, the best example we have of video games as art? This comment comes off as so thoughtless and seems to fly under the radar of so many people, I have to wonder... do video gamers *really* care? Are we actually interested in the artistic merit of the games we play? Or are we simply seeking validation?

Closing Thoughts: Next time you play a video game, stop and consider how you let the game affect you.  Are you simply consuming the game, gluttonously consuming the game until you are through, and on to the next? Simply filling time and emotion with a buzz not unlike an alcoholic? Or are you carefully considering the game, the texture, the shape... listening to what it has to say? Allowing it to enrich your life?

Which the trailer strongly led people to believe.

Here are some pictures of the segment from the trailer advertising online modes, and the tweet.
http://imgur.com/a/KUvIH

EDIT:  Also of note is that the store page for the game on psn solidifies the idea that there is online play, showing pictures of what looks like a multiplayer lobby, and advertising ""Network Battle Mode.""  Ad-Hoc multiplayer is probably what they meant, but Network Battle Mode is poor wording when you only mean local play, on an online service that is called the Playstation Network.  

So, anyone who was considering this game, look out.  Might not be what you were expecting.  

**EDIT:**  04/24 - Arc System Works has removed the trailer that advertised online modes and uploaded a hastily edited variation of the japanese trailer.  This is how it looks now.

To install go to properties, betas tab, select performance from the drop down menu

Only major thing missing is mouse capture, played a 3v3 without lag and 60fps even with maxed armies fighting.

EDIT: if the beta patch does not show up on the drop down menu you need to restart steam.

EDIT2: Patch notes for those at work.

Patch Notes for ‘performance build’

Frame rate &amp; performance improvements that increase frame rates up to 50% on low end machines and up to 500% on the high end systems previously experiencing frame rate issues.

Visual fixes:
Windows DPI scaling no longer zooms the in-game perspective.

Default scroll speed increased.

Multiplayer fixes including:

Quitting a multiplayer game triggers a resignation instead appearing as a ‘drop’.

Private lobbies stay private.

Quick match no longer crashes.

Long Steam usernames no longer cause crash.

Hotkeys for multiplayer are correctly saved.

Lobby now enforces that you only play multiplayer with the same build version.

Visual indications of players in your lobby and in game who have low frame rate.

Better networking verification prior to entering game (prevents getting stuck on the voting screen).

Performance warning if you have high ping to one other player who isn’t host or if your data is being relayed.

Multiplayer quick match speed defaults to normal.

Quick match has additional map size filter.

Multiplayer Lobby doesn’t lock to a region for displaying games.

Achievements fix: Single player unlocks achievements properly.

I would rant more about the abuse of Kickstarter by profitable companies, but this isn't the place ;-)

After having to redownload the game several different times and constant searching of different forums, I had finally managed to get the game to start for me without crashing. Just to freeze on the first loading screen. Further research shows this is also a common error people are getting. With Radical entertainment having been shutdown and no word from their skeleton crew on any patches or support. It is looking rather bleak for this game. The forums on steam are loaded with nothing but errors for this game and people frustrated because their tickets for refunds as well as tickets asking if there will be any support are being flat ignored. Sadly, a chargeback is not even a option due to steams policy of disabling your entire account upon receiving a chargeback.

If you can't bother to decrypt his language I'll try to interpret it for you.

1. Microsoft is buying out publishers to not mention the PS4 versions of multi-platform titles, so you can assume if the presenter does not say ""EXCLUSIVE TO XBOX ONE"", that it will also be on PS4.

2. More in depth DRM info at Gamescom. There is no rental strategy, they're trying to just sweep it under the rug and hope people don't remember.

3. Cloud power was designed as DRM. It was Microsoft's idea, and they approached other publishers. EA and Ubisoft support, Activision slightly less so.

4. DRM plans are worse than what they have said.

5. Mirror's Edge 2 at MS conference. **not shown, wait for EA conference.**

6. Prince of Persia (reboot?) at MS conference. **not shown, wait for Ubisoft conference.**

7. Secret Phil Spencer game = World of Tanks. It is said that you still need Gold to play F2P games?

8. Paywall for Xbox One.

9. Dead Rising 3 as Xbox One exclusive. Exclusive DLC for another Capcom game.

10. No paywall for PS4, but it's unconfirmed.

11. Sony is very tight on their DRM policies, so no DRM info.

They're claiming the esram on the XBO can actually push 192.0 GB/s. That sounds really great...

Except if we read the actual statement, it is this.

&gt; However, with near-final production silicon, Microsoft techs have found that the hardware is capable of reading and writing simultaneously. Apparently, there are spare processing cycle ""holes"" that can be utilised for additional operations.

No, they didn't wake up one morning and realize there was an extra data line in their memory module, so lets drill down to what that actually means.

&gt; Apparently, there are spare processing cycle ""holes"" that can be utilised for additional operations.

In other words, no, it isn't capable of bidirectional data transfer. Their trying to push through a few extra memory operations, but the it's still strictly read or write.

Now, look at the actual numbers. I have to give credit to [R_K_M](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1h8x4r/xbox_one_memory_performance_improved_for/cas1jlb) and [Boreras](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1h8x4r/xbox_one_memory_performance_improved_for/cas2g2y) for pointing this out. I'm just aggregating, so I'm going to direct quote.

&gt; If I am not mistaken, that just means that they lowered the clock from 800 to 750 and are using the bi-directonal bandwith number for marketing when everyone else is using the bandwith number in one direction. - R_K_M

&gt; you're right the numbers do match up perfectly for that (750 (GPU clock) * 128 (bus width)*2(read&amp;write during same cycle) = 192.0 GB/s --- if it were 800 MHz you would get 204.8 GB/s) - Boreras

**So we can basically confirm that cboat was correct.** The numbers tell the truth. The esram has been downclocked, and Microsoft's PR department is trying to spin it as an increase in total bandwidth based on some cycle tricks that are probably being exaggerated.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_1h9ix3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1h9ix3/so_did_microsoft_just_spin_a_downclocked_esram/,

1375636493.0,1300,self.Games,1jorqe,What do you guys think are some of the best gaming levels of this generation? *Spoilers probably*,WtfWhereAreMyClothes,2041,741,1904,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jorqe/what_do_you_guys_think_are_some_of_the_best/,"There have been tons of great games, but what are some where the actual levels/missions were so memorable that they're still with you and make you wish you could just play it for the first time again?  A few of mine:

**Fort Frolic - Bioshock** - the level where you first meet Sander Cohen.  Chilling and fascinating, the entire level was just such a freakish thrill ride.  Plus, the piano song known only as Cohen's masterpiece is absolutely brilliant.  I learned how to play it on the piano but it took months - it's insanely complex and incredibly well written.

**All Ghillied Up - COD4** - Back when COD was a lot more innovative, I feel like this level is one that no shooter has been able to come close to matching since.  And that helicopter scene... that's the kind of thing that scripted events should be.

**Winter - The Last of Us** - Probably less a single level and more a large chunk of the game, but Winter felt very isolated from the rest of The Last of Us.  Rather than having a firm goal of reaching the fireflies, the stakes changed, a new villain was introduced, and we got to mix up who we played as.  The entire game is remarkable, but this section in particular was absolutely stunning and could have been its own amazing game.  I would probably consider this one to be my personal pick for level of the generation.

**The Department Store - Condemned** - probably not as well known, but anyone who played Condemned knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  You end up in an abandoned department store where all of the mannequins may or may not be alive.  This level was the cause of many, many screams between my friends and I over the years.

**The Forsworn (not sure what the mission is actually called) - Skyrim** - this mission was the epitome of what a good Elder Scrolls game is to me.  Immersion, intrigue, a sense of helplessness, a sense of power, and its own story arc that made it seem like such an epic, incredible journey that was just a couple of hours long.

**The big reveal - Bioshock Infinite** - I won't say anything about this.  Obviously refers to the last 15 minutes of Bioshock Infinite.

**The cargo plane - Uncharted 3** - Sure, this was only about 10 minutes long but... holy shit. Just holy shit.  Not the best level of the generation, but it sure as hell was thrilling.

What are some of your guys' favorites?

EDIT: Okay, I clearly missed a couple here - the part where you glide through the sands in **Journey** is easily one of the most incredible experiences of this generation.  Definitely very high up there.  The ending of Max Payne 3 is pretty incredible too.  Also, can't forget the ending of the walking dead and the suicide mission of mass effect 2... along with a few from mass effect 3.

If you don't have time to read through the wall of text this old video of mine (Its good, just never really got popular) illustrates my points nicely: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OZ2aEqyN14

I started playing back in the beta around 1.5, for me the beta adventure update marked the first step in the wrong direction for survival mode.  Basically it still feels like the game hasn’t been improved all that much given the amount of time, and money garnered from it. To keep this relatively easy to read I'll spit this up into 5 sections: 

 
Difficulty:

While the addition of sprinting ,hunger and blocking appeared initially to be a much welcomed features it has become much too easy to escape danger, even on the harder difficulty modes. If you were unlucky enough to have a creeper chasing you back in the beta it was genuinely frightening as you couldn’t easily out run it with the push of a button. With the new sprinting feature anyone with half a brain can stay alive during the night even without armour, effectively nullifying the point of setting up a cosy shelter in the first place. This brings us onto the next point of the games near complete lack of progression in terms of weapon tiers and difficulty.


Risk vs. Reward: 

You start up a new map, get your wood pickaxe followed by your stone pick axe and maybe even iron, all within your first day. Then what? You drill a 1x1 hole down straight into the ground until you get to bedrock, all it takes after that is the tedium of mining either left or right until you strike diamond without ever needing to come into contact with an enemy. Even if you were to come into contact with an enemy at that depth, chances are they will still be the exact same as they were on the surface. I was excited when they finally added armour, enchantments and weapons to mobs, but then immediately disappointed when I found out that instead of spawning these harder mobs at a lower depth  they were spawned at a ridiculously lower percentage, no matter what depth. This is also true for many of the unique enemy types in the game such as the spider jockeys, charged creepers, witches &amp; silverfish. 

With only 4 enemy types in the over world it seems nonsensical to have so many monsters which are rarely, if ever seen, why not utilize these more effectively by simply spawning harder monsters the further down you go? T o accompany increased difficulty in depth why not also add at least two more tiers of ore in between the tier gap of iron and diamond. Perhaps even adding something beyond diamond in the nether to actually encourage players to go to the place. 


Variety:

While I do believe that the more recent additions to farming are very much appreciated, for a game about blocks there still seems to be a relatively small amount of building materials. New types of trees, dirt and stone could all be utilized to create additional biomes, along with an increase in the amount of building materials (metals, glass, bricks,etc) would satisfy users who only play creative mode as well. The near complete emptiness of the sea, save for one mob seems like a colossal waste of space; fish, seaweed, corals could all be used to flesh out the ocean biomes and make them less boring. Hell, they could even add predators to scare people away from deep water. I could go on and on about potential addons but this thread isn’t a suggestion list. To put it simply, as a sandbox game it needs more variety for people to actually go out and explore the procedurally generated land.


Mods:

I know alot of my issues with the game can be fixed with mods, the problem with moding however is that often they’re incompatible or flat out break with each official update. The promised moding API has been delayed 3 times now with no official estimate as far as I know. Skyrim did moding correctly, Nexus and the Steamworkshop vastly improved the core experience of the game with relative ease. This should be the most important feature to add to a Sandbox game like this, I don’t expect Mojang to create as much content as the collective Minecraft community but I do expect some level of official support to help facilitate that community. 


Other Questionable design decisions:

This is more based on personal opinion if anything but a few additional issues I’ve got:

1)	NPC villagers should have never been added, for one their overall appearance is questionable at best but more importantly they ruin the feeling of ‘loneliness’ that one gets when playing survival single player, or to give another game as an example; Dark Souls.

2)	The End for a multitude of reasons; Firstly the entire boss fight is honestly one of the worst I’ve ever experienced in a game, it’s not fun, it’s just straight up tedious. The ending itself is about 8 minutes of scrolling philosophical text, who honestly thinks that is a satisfying conclusion? If anything the ‘ending’ for the game should’ve been more like Proteus, keeping it concise, and vague with multiple interpretations. OR to put it simply; no ending at all, it's a sandbox game it doesn't need one. Personally I’ve always envisioned MineCraft as a purgatory world, but that’s me and I’m sure other people don’t even care about the ‘story’ of the game. 



Wow, that ended up being alot longer then intended; hopefully you’ve had the patience to read through it all. If not you can probably gather my points just by skimming through each section.

Regardless of the fact that it's not even that great a game, have you ever wanted to buy a game but been put off by the large DLC catalogues?

I appreciate at least, that this isn't an issue for all games since a lot have inevitable GOTY editions. But games I can think of off the top of my head which don't have DLC compilations include:

- Final Fantasy XIII-2
- Dead Space 1 and 2
- Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom
- Street Fighter X Tekken
- Dragon's Dogma
- Enslaved

Capcom games in general seem to follow this trend (ignoring Street Fighter IV arcade edition).

1360386935.0,1258,self.Games,186g7x,Is it fair to ask if Valve has failed in terms of Half Life Episodes?,jdemart,2058,800,707,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/186g7x/is_it_fair_to_ask_if_valve_has_failed_in_terms_of/,"I want to preface this by saying that I love the Half Life series. I've played every major game, some of the spin offs, and loved all of them. HL2 is one of my favorite games of all time.

That being said, Valve has really dropped the ball on their own terms. Episode 1 was announced and released in 2006, 2 years after Half Life 2 came out. Now, two years is enough time for a full length sequel to be developed and released, but I had no problems with this: Valve never rush their products and triple A games take time. 

The problem lies in what they said at the time: they announced a trilogy of episodic content in 2006 ""that will conclude by Christmas of 2007"", according to their own press release. 3 shorter episodes in about 24 months - and here's the crux of it - "" We decided that a follow-up to Half-Life 2 delivered in 18 months with our first episode was more in tune with what our customers want than waiting 6 years for another monolithic product.""

Half Life 2 Episode 2 came out in October 2007, which is about when Episode 3 was due. Here again I was willing to cut Valve some slack for the same reasons - it was well worth the wait, and delays have unfortunately become part of gaming over the past five years or so.

However, it's now February 2013 and we've heard almost nothing about Episode 3. That means it's been 6 years after the date they said all three episodes would be out by, six years since Episode 2- the same six year gap they wanted to put out episodic content to avoid! - and 8 years and 3 months since Half Life 2 was release. 

Valve, admittedly, owes us nothing. I'm by no means demanding Episode 3 information, a release date, or anything. But after such a long gap, I think it's fair to say that episodic gaming simply hasn't worked for the series for one important reason: the whole justification behind it just didn't work out at all.

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

Over an hour it grew to this. I'm curious what other people think as well.*

Quite simply from someone who tries to objectively view games I find myself in a situation where I can say, easily, that Bad Company 2 was a better 'game' than Battlefield 3.

There are numerous reasons why:

**Health/Damage disparity:** In BC2 you could take 1 or 2 more bullets from nearly every source. This made headshots worth more and made it so if you were skillful enough you could manage to get a kill when surprised by an enemy. In actuality you still have 100 hp... its the gun damages that were altered.

In BC2 the weapons of the offensive kits did about 14-16.7 damage per bullet. In BF3 they do 26-31. This means you die in 4 bullets in BF3 and 7 in BC2.

**The Guns:**
""Man I really like the ak-47! It's just feels like the best for me.""
""Yeah man, I know that feeling. The FAMAS is just a killing machine in my hands!""
That crap is an illusion. Here are the gun stats from [BC2](http://denkirson.xanga.com/722757523/bad-company-2/) and [BF3](http://symthic.com/charts.php).

In BF3 almost all the guns are homogeneous in every way. Every gun class (assault rifle, submachine, etc) may have 12 different skins but there are only 2 different guns. They vary in this way. Either one gun has a lower fire rate but more damage or a higher fire rate and lower damage. Of course once you categorize them this way you may notice that your favorite gun isn't the most statistically superior in the 'lower fire rate higher damage' category and is beat out by another gun with equal stats in everything except reload time. And even then the reload time is only .05 better.

Hell, [here are Modern Warfare 3's gun stats](http://symthic.com/mw3charts.php). They're almost identical to BF3's in every way. They even kill in the same number of bullets.

In BC2 you had more variety. Different guns had special properties. Some had their damage drop off in different ways at a distance, some didn't drop off at all. Some guns had unique firing modes. Some let you switch weapons faster. Some had different spread patterns (mostly shotguns). They had the same homogenization issue but on a much smaller level. Every gun had a statistically similar pair or two... but not 5-8 pairs.

I also enjoyed the potency of the pistols in BC2.

**The Maps:**
The maps in BC3 were almost entirely designed for consoles (by that I mean their max player cap per server). There were very few maps that played properly with 64 players. Hell, on most maps even 32 was pushing it. Quite frankly... this is incredibly obvious from a design standpoint.

Hell, even the god damn vehicle spawns don't adjust for players. It's like they wanted enough vehicles for only 32 players at all times. This creates a situation where on 32 vs 32 on several maps in BF3 you literally don't have enough transportation out of your base. You could fill every seat on every vehicle and still leave several people walking absurd distances. And since most people roll off by themselves you get half your damn base walking.

Too much close quarters combat. They appear to have been trying to cater to the CoD crowd here. I know that sounds like something a forum troll would say but seriously... CoD maps are all about closed sightlines and close quarters combat.

Battlefield is about large maps and large amounts of players battling it out with tons of vehicles and armaments. There are plenty of open areas in BF3 but they aren't places where you should normally be fighting. The funnel the players via incentives and choke points. An incentive is having an objective in a tunnel. A choke point is having to go into a tunnel to get to the objective. BF3 made the mistake of having a god damn inventive in a god damn choke point.

The system that Battlefield's 64 player combat created was that you didn't need large amounts of incentives or choke points to control the action. How it worked was simple. There were so many players that you were literally incapable of not running into someone.

Of course there many subtleties. Since there were two main bases you knew which direction the player would be coming from. Since players could spawn from captured points you knew that was also a possible direction they could be coming from. If you manage to come from an unexpected direction you were almost guaranteed a kill.

This is why crap like Rush is just that, crap. You have one ingress through one or two choke points towards the objective. They know where you are coming from and where you are going. This creates what I like to call a killing field. A killing field is an impassable @#$% house of people camping behind better cover than you.

This includes:
Respawns close to the objectives
Better accuracy because they're camping (being prone)
Smaller profile to hit (they're prone so you are going to have a hard time hitting/seeing them)
Escalating advantage (you take out on point and then there is only one left. This makes it so you can't overwhelm one point when there forces are split. If 32 are fighting 32 and one side has a huge advantage I wonder who wins)

**The Vehicles:**
Honestly this is a big one. So many things were changed. First off the unlock system makes vehicular combat incredibly unfair for new players. This is especially true for anything that flys. The unlocks for jets are what let them fulfill a function for your team. A new player in a jet has no way to defend themselves from the one billion rockets locked on to them or that Ace Pilot Lt. General RapeStorm coming his way with missiles locked on, his codpiece ready, and his extra large pack of flares.

No vehicle in a Battlefield game (hell, no games I can think of) should start of useless. You can barely attack anything that isn't another jet with the stuff it starts with. You have to 'unlock' crap that lets you actually contribute to the team below. Hell, a lot of jet players don't even take such unlocks and just continue to play the super fun jet mini-game in the sky that has 0 influence of the games objective. It's like everyone is playing Quidditch... except everyone on the ground is the chaser while the jet players are the pointless rabble of unnecessary extra positions.

The whole lock-on thing in general kinda sucks. It forces you to bring certain unlocks. It also raises another problem... too many players. The more players in the game the more lock-on sources... but the amount of vehicles doesn't change.

Bad Company 2 did it right and a bit wrong. Vehicles had a powerful presence and were hard to deal with but still being vulnerable to a foot soldier. Even someone ready to take one down would have to have a bit of skill to do it. You had two options hit it with dumbfire explosives (or the vaguely 'guided' launchers) or tag that beast with a tracer dart. This was a solid system because if they were flying in a way that made them hard to hit with the dart pistol then their crew had an incredibly hard time aiming.

When every player can lock-on to your vehicle with a two hit kill launcher from anywhere on the map you need to have a system for the pilot to be able avoid those lock-ons. This results in a single individual being almost incapable of taking down a chopper/jet.

The only problem was when you had a blackbird at the top of the skybox. This created several problems... namely that you literally couldn't stop it. They were higher than you so you couldn't ascend up to them in another blackbird because you couldn't aim your guns straight up... so they would spray you with miniguns until you exploded. They had a permanent floating spawn point.

My solution... lower the damn skybox.

My last issue is the disabled vehicle status in Battlefield 3. It caused several problems.
1. Investment vs reward: In order to take it down in a traditional manner you need to role engineer. You risk life and limb to fire 2-5 rpgs at this beast. You may get lucky and have the rear be exposed or you might risk even more trying to get a line of sight on its ass. You take your shots and bam... 100 points. They all get out of the disabled pos and either get away or get picked off by the rest of your team. Sure you can nab one too but what the hell.

You rolled engineer to blow these things up. A big hulking monstrosity full of players being destroyed should result in the points for 1x hulking monstrosity and 4x players housed within.

2. Only two good ways to blow them up and be properly rewarded. C4 or landmines. C4 is for active destruction (see a tank and blow it up). You can destroy it all at once and everyone inside. Landmines are for passive destruction (ambiently protecting your bases and maps). Land mines have the same property of being able to destroy armor in one go. You need 3 each to completely destroy a vehicle. Additionally landmines don't despawn when you die (which I agree with... but not when launchers aren't viable like they are in BF3) which further compounds their advantage.

**The Server Browser:**
Holy crap. The battle-log is just that... a nice floating log in a toilette. When it works it works well enough. But it never works. Either someone appears offline for no reason, the chat doesn't work (voice/text), the chat does work but randomly omits certain things, and so much more. Playing with your friends on the same team has never been so difficult.

My main complaint is it has all sorts of unique issues in every browser. It's a hulking crapsack. Battlefield has a history of releasing unusable server browsers but in this day and age... come on. It feels like BF2142 all over again.

**The Ranking System:**
Not too many gripes here. It takes a bit too long to level up into class defining mechanics. Hell, it takes too long to level up without resorting to stupid crap like MAV point farming (float the thing to the top of the map and just get points for marking crap and get 1st place at the end of the round).

**The Little Things:**
Lets start with scope glare. Well all sniper scopes have the same two types of glare. A crapload or none at all. That's right that 6x has the same amount of glare as a 12x. Fine, sun glinting off glass is sun glinting off glass. I find it renders snipers and even more compromising class. Not only with all the new players role recon/sniper/1337assassin... they will now role one and be easily targetable at a distance. It also discourages scouting via scope and instead only shooting at enemies you can readily see without a scope.

The flashlight. I just personally find it retarded. Sure even in real life you can temporarily render someone incapable of seeing properly if your light source has a high luminous intensity. I might also add that your eyes aren't nearly as susceptible to this if they are adjusted to daylight.

How certain unlocks are unlocked on a per-gun basis. I don't know what kind of mentally handicapped soldier I am that I can't just remove the scope I unlocked on one gun onto another. Hell, I can even put it onto another that uses the same kind of accessory rail. This exists solely to pad out unlocks.

**Destructibility:**
How BF3 has less destructibility on maps then BC2. Buildings don't collapse, very few walls are destructible, very little cover is destructible, and generally less crap being blow-up-able. This is just another feature that was lost. I enjoyed the changing dynamic of the maps during a game. In the first ten minutes people took cover in this building. At the twenty minute mark that building was a hole in the ground so they all moved on to new locations. That rooftop where all those noob snipers camp bothering you? Blow it the @#$% up.

**Realism is not equivalent to fun nor is it the antithesis:**
People complain about realism in games or want more. If realism adds to the game in a positive way then implement the feature. If it doesn't... then avoid it like the plague.

I'd like to talk about skill in Cod games. Your aim in CoD is far from the most important thing a player needs to succeed. The only real skill in CoD is your ability to move around the map in a way that offers you the most advantageous sight lines while denying your opponent theirs. Being able to do this in an unpredictable manner is the highest level of skill in that game.

As a gamer who enjoyed Unreal Tournament, Quake, Halo, and more I understand how this kind of skill is important... but I also understand how being shot at and dying with zero chance of retaliation in a 'game' is not fun.

Creating a game that has reasonable health pools along with this skill in using sight lines is what creates a competitive fps game with a high skill cap. People often mistake this for the argument of health vs damage. It isn't. It's encounter duration vs player ability (using sight lines and accuracy).

CoD is popular because it's modern setting which appeals to a wide demographic (and it's a setting which lets new players adjust faster and become invested in quicker due to it's familiarity) and how easy it is to do good (and bad).

**In Closing:**
Battlefield Bad Company 2 was a lot closer to the sweet spot in 'encounter duration vs player ability' and differentiated itself from the competition.

Battlefield 3 while advancing graphics steps further from that sweet spot while attempting to play like its competition. These two factors make for a game that is less fun, less skillful, less strategic, and a game that no longer exists within it's own niche.

To me personally it feels like Battlefield 3 wanted to become CoD like draw in its user base and instead of evolving the features of the Battlefield IP (large combat, vehicles, etc) simply used them by saying ""hey we have this feature and CoD doesn't"".

I like CoD (as a player, not a consumer) and I like Battlefield. But I don't like what Battlefield 3 became. All it did was get better graphics, appeal to CoD's user base, lose a ton of features, and stagnate.

Do you consider this fair?",BulldogFanNH,2496,1280,973,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c0gzr/kerbal_space_program_a_game_which_was_using_the/,"For some context. 

Here is [reddit thread regarding the stream where it was first mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1bxuwp/summary_of_dev_team_announcements_for_020_and/). The [video of the stream itself is linked here,](http://www.twitch.tv/kerbalsp/b/388327332) with the mention of the expansion at about the 52 minute mark.

The expansion is heavily discussed in [this thread directly addressing the topic,](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1byoiz/we_now_know_that_squad_plans_to_release_paid/) with Squad(developer of KSP) Community Manager /u/SkunkMonkey defending the news. 

For posterity(because SkunkMonkey has indicated the language will be changed shortly) this is a screenshot of the About page for the game which has since alpha release included the statement.

&gt;[During development, the game is available for purchase at a discounted price, which we will gradually increase up to its final retail price as the game nears completion. So by ordering early, you get the game for a lot less, and you'll get all future updates for free.](http://imgur.com/XCNvlei)

The [FAQ page](http://imgur.com/BdoR2Cq) on the official site reaffirms this with...

&gt;**If I buy the game now will I have to buy it again for the next update?**

&gt;No, if you buy the game now you won't have to pay for further updates.

---------------

In short SkunkMonkey has asserted an expansion cannot be in any way considered an update. [He also argues it's unreasonable to expect any company to give all additions to the game to alpha purchasers and that no company has ever done anything like that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1byoiz/we_now_know_that_squad_plans_to_release_paid/c9br697/) He has yet to respond to the suggestion that Mojang is a successful game company who offered alpha purchasers the same ""all updates for free"" promise and has continued to deliver on that promise 2 years after the game's official release. 

Do you think SkunkMonkey is correct in his argument or do you think there is merit to the users who are demanding that Squad release the expansion free of cost to the early adopters who purchased the game when it was stated in multiple places on the official sites that ""all future updates"" would be free of cost to alpha purchasers? Is there merit to the idea that the promise was actually ""all updates for free except the ones we decide to charge for"" that has been mentioned several times in the threads linked? 

It should be noted that some of the content mentioned for the expansion had been previously touched upon by devs several times before the announcement there would ever be any expansion packs leading users to believe it was coming to the stock game they purchased. 

I think the big question at the center of this is how an update is defined. Is an update any addition or alteration to a game regardless of size or price? Should a company be allowed to get out of promising all updates for free simply by drawing a line in front of certain content and declaring it to be an expansion.

1357939460.0,1189,self.Games,16efty,"/r/Games will hit 200,000 subscribers in a few days. Let's talk about some ideas for improving the comments here.",Deimorz,2063,874,463,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16efty/rgames_will_hit_200000_subscribers_in_a_few_days/,"/r/Games is now the 45th largest subreddit, and should be crossing the 200,000 subscriber milestone in the next few days. And our activity level is even quite a bit higher than our size - [we're #17 for average number of comments posted per day, and usually in the top 25 for number of users online](http://stattit.com/r/Games/), even higher than some default subreddits. This is very impressive growth for only launching the subreddit a little over a year ago, but unfortunately this sort of growth comes with challenges in maintaining quality.

By far the largest complaint we see about /r/Games is a worry about declining quality of comments and discussions. We've already taken a couple of measures toward helping this over the past few months:

1. [We've been putting an ""[/r/all]"" tag on threads that reach the first couple of pages of /r/all](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/10y64k/regarding_the_warning_rall_flair/) to warn that that comments will likely include a lot of people that don't normally visit the subreddit (and often don't even realize it's not the same subreddit as /r/gaming). Of course this doesn't actually *improve* the comments in any way, but it's just a reminder that you shouldn't necessarily come to any conclusions about the subreddit based on the comments in those submissions. They're not representative.
2. A lot of you may not even realize this, but [AutoModerator has been automatically removing extremely low-effort comments for about 4 months now](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zq43i/a_few_minor_rgames_rules_updates/). Comments like ""lol"", ""this"", ""came here to post this"", etc. as well as comments that consist entirely of a link to a gif or meme are automatically removed immediately after they're posted. This has overall been very effective and successful, with hardly any false positives (which get manually un-removed).

So that's helped somewhat, but there are definitely still issues. Specifically, I've becoming more and more concerned lately about how many people are misusing the downvote button as ""disagree"" or ""dislike"" instead of ""doesn't contribute to discussion"". Multiple users have contacted us complaining about it, and I've seen many instances of perfectly reasonable comments being heavily downvoted just because the poster was defending an unpopular opinion. For example, most comments expressing anything positive towards ""popular to hate"" games like Diablo III, Final Fantasy XIII, The War Z, any CoD, etc. will receive quite a few downvotes regardless of the actual quality of the comment.

This is unfortunate, because downvoted comments naturally receive less attention (even being ""collapsed"" by default if they hit -5), so this stifles discussion directly. It also has a more long-term ""cultural"" effect in that users become less willing to express opinions they know aren't popular because they expect to just be downvoted. This is not good for a subreddit that wants to have quality discussions, since some of the best discussions are based around disagreements.

So here's an idea for a potential **experiment** (meaning if it doesn't work out, we can just reverse it) that I'd like to test out to try and improve this situation:

---

Before I get into any details, I want to make it absolutely clear that **there is no way to truly prevent downvoting on reddit**. The best we can do is *hide* the down arrow using CSS. This means that any clients/users that don't pay attention to the CSS (including all phone apps, users that have subreddit styles disabled, users using RES, etc.) are all still able to downvote.

However, our goal isn't necessarily to completely prevent *all* downvotes, just reducing them would be an improvement. And though I have no actual data to support it, I strongly suspect that the majority of users access the site through a standard browser using the subreddit CSS, so there should definitely be a decent reduction. Really, we can't know how well it would work without trying it.

Now, one of the reasons I've always been personally opposed to hiding the downvote arrow is that some posts really do *deserve* to be downvoted. Completely irrelevant comments, trolling, etc. Go look at the bottom of some of the comments pages of some popular posts in /r/Games, you'll see plenty of examples. So if we were to try out hiding the arrow, it would also need to be combined with **more moderators, and increased comment moderation**.

We would recruit multiple users that are active in the community and contribute quality comments often, and empower them to be able to remove the comments that truly should not even have been posted. To be clear, this would not be removing ""bad"" comments (since that's terribly subjective), but only ones that have no value at all. Similar to the ones that AutoModerator already does remove, just with more flexibility due to that whole ""human judgment"" thing. So basically if the comment truly did deserve to be downvoted, you could report it to the mods instead for removal.

In addition, if a user is seen to consistently and repeatedly make comments that have no place in /r/Games, they could be banned. Currently we don't ban anyone except bots, but I think if we want to really start trying to clean up the comments it may be necessary. Of course, one of the reasons that we don't use the ban system is that it's extremely easy to circumvent. Whenever you ban a user on reddit, they're sent a private message telling them they were banned, and they can go create a new account in seconds to continue posting. So this would likely have to be combined with having AutoModerator automatically remove all comments made by users less than a day old or something along those lines to make it less trivial to circumvent.

Anyway, to sum up, here's the overall idea for the experiment:

* Hide the downvote arrow on comments (**not** submissions, only comments).

* Start removing extremely poor comments and banning users that consistently post them.

* Increase number of moderators to handle this additional workload.

Please let me know why this is a terrible idea, or if you think we should at least give it a shot (probably for a week or two to really be able to see the effects). And if you have any other ideas at all about what we could do to improve the subreddit (related to comment quality or not), please feel free to post them as well.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,1357940110.0,,,True,t3_16efty,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16efty/rgames_will_hit_200000_subscribers_in_a_few_days/,moderator

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Tony, our Amazon rep on reddit posted this in /r/SimCity - 
&gt;Hey guys,
&gt;I just saw this note and saw this issue (I was at comicon all day).
&gt;For 100% transparency here is the mistake that led to this issue. Note this was absolutely a mistake, and orders that were did not use CAGROCKS were cancelled as well.
&gt;On Thursday we learned that there would no longer be a pre-load for SimCity. In response I set up a mass mail to go out to every customer who had pre-ordered the game up until we found out there wasn't a pre-load anymore.
&gt;When I filed this request, I copy/pasted a previous request for a mass mail, in this previous request the words ""also please cancel all of the attached orders"" (we had an issue with a product previously that we had to cancel/refund orders on because the product never shipped).
&gt;So, when sending the email out, letting customers know there was no pre-load, we also cancelled all the orders.
&gt;Again, this was totally my bad.
&gt;Cheers, Tony

Seems to me the best way to get results is to ring 8664390310 or get them to ring you, and they can apply the discount directly to your account again.

Any non Americans worried about them throwing a fit over you not being american, I phoned up with an incredibly Northern English accent, spoke to an Irish guy, and he applied the code for me with no questions. I even gave him my English billing address. Phoning 8664390310 with US selected through Skype was free also.",[/r/all],False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_19km6g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19km6g/psa_for_those_that_ordered_sim_city_on_amazon/,

If you have any interest in trying out EVE Online now is the time (feel free to message me for details), summer is approaching and there are going to be defensive fights in all corners of our space.

Essentially we (TEST) have separated from our former allies due to cultural reasons. In addition to resetting the CFC a couple months ago and the recent departure of Pandemic Legion, we have now multiplied our enemies by quite a lot and will likely be putting out fires for the better part of the next 6 months.

We are retaining a small number of allies that hold space near to us but the official leadership stance is to reduce our blues (allies) and not take part in another coalition. As we hold a massive amount of space we are going to be stretched very thin, should be fun.

This should lead to the megawar of the summer.

1363530192.0,1155,self.Games,1agq2e,/r/games is becoming about as substantive as /r/gaming...,Linksawake,5390,4235,880,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1agq2e/rgames_is_becoming_about_as_substantive_as_rgaming/," - Top article is someone completely dismissing the ""bros before hos"" discussion because of a technicality, rather than providing a thought provoking analasys of the base point that using ""bros before hos"" may or may not potentially be seen as offensive and/or tasteless...

 - Top comment of that article is pure snark and the thread there degenerates into ivory tower sarcasm and eye rolling.

 - Then a lot of other articles are pretty much anti-EA/SimCity biased articles. While it's relevant and I don't mind new information be upvoted. **A lot of the same points are being raised over and over**. It feels like someone went ""guy's the cake is a lie, ammirite?"" on /r/gaming. and just mined a bunch of meaningless karma for it.

 - Overall, the attitude seems to be changing from one of discourse, free discussion and thought provoking topics, to one of gaming mob mentality.

 - It also feelst like vestiges of the ""gaming taliban"" are lurking in this subreddit more and more, and this concerns me.

I'm probably not the first or last to observe this, but is there any way, because we have stricter mods on this subreddit (unlike /r/gaming) that the rules could change and become a bit more strict. 

I think people should justify their posts and comments more than just trying to get laughs or DAE posts.

**EDIT 3:** Obviously the title of this thread is exaggerated on a value to value basis - if you take a title like that literally your kind of missing the point, /r/games has rules that will always stop it from being as bad as /r/gaming, but the community spirit, is definitely moving towards /r/gaming and that is the point I am driving at.

**EDIT 2:** I think mods should pretty much ruthlessly cull any post or comment that adds little to a discussion that they see.

**EDIT:** Some redditors think I have some kind of bias with this discussion, yes, the bros before hos sub really annoyed me on multiple levels - I felt it reeked of ""sweep this under the rug because reasons"" mentality, rather than actually discussing the core issue. It was ""agree with me and upvote me"" style post and I apologize if the comment I made on that thread was counterproductive, it was an emotional reaction to the lack of true discussion on this subreddit overall that I am seeing more and more. It means that those that want the status quo never have to defend their position, they never have to construct a decent argument, they just ignore and upvote and agree with eachother.

If you want to see my posts on the Bros before Hos topic, feel free to search it. It was a bad decision to post so angrily, but again, it was my emotive reaction to how downhill actual debate is in this subreddit.

I had never played the game--just heard stories about what a disaster it was at release. I also heard about how there was a new director and they were turning towards the community to help make changes to the game for its eventual re-release this year. When I signed up on XIV's website, I wasn't expecting anything more than a fun curiosity; a memorable train-wreck, or perhaps a nice weekend distraction at best. Boy, did I underestimate this game.

I'm writing this because after having now experienced FFXIV it is painfully disappointing to see such a lack of discussion and anticipation around what really feels like an exceptionally good game.

FFXIV somehow manages to re-capture a feeling I got playing FF games like VI, Tactics, IX, and XI--a feeling which, to me, is absent from SE's other, later releases. This game *feels* like a Final Fantasy title worthy of the name. I'm going to hit on what stood out to me about the game and why you should consider FFXIV a game worth experiencing when it is released later this year.



**1. Atmosphere:**

Holy shit this this thing is one of the most immersive game worlds I have ever experienced. Every detail within the game's environment has been carefully thought about to enhance your interaction with a cohesively designed world that really feels like it is a living, breathing organism. Where some game worlds feel like suburbia, big and empty, this game feels like Tokyo. Dense, no space wasted; strange and beautiful.

Light beams radiate through dense forest canopy, character animations and clothing are *obsessively* designed. Ambient sounds of chatter and laughter are heard throughout a village, based on the density of PCs in the area and what *voice* those PCs chose during character creation. The night sky moves across time with the rotation of the planet. Amounts of light pollution affect how many stars you can see. Sounds of battle echo throughout caves, weather and light changes, and with it the instruments and emotion of the background music being played. Rainy day? Chipper harp and piano arrangement evolve into *fucking sad xylophones.* That's right. Playing this game is like some sort of Synaesthesic fever climax of the eyes, ears, and fingertips.

On the beta forums you can tell this is a special concern of the game designers. To give you a sense of this, among hundreds of other official feedback is this gem:

&gt;Feedback: ""Male [Lalafells](http://i.imgur.com/Tuu13Lvh.jpg) have no nipples. Please implement them.""

&gt;Status: No Plans to Address

&gt;Reply: ""After looking into this, we have decided that we will not be addressing this.""

Yeah, that's right. They *thought* about that.



**2. Gameplay**

The game world feels layered, and this is mirrored in the gameplay. There are a myriad of methods available to players leveling a class or crafting profession and the game's many options for progression across different aspects of play all feel really rewarding. It feels like the kind of game where you can log in for 30 minutes and accomplish something, but that feeling is also pretty addictive..

Solo play is now a viable way to level. There are extra rewards for parties, to motivate players to group up if they so choose. Larger parties get full experience for kill, as well as bonus experience based on the size of the party (up to 8).  ""Limit breaks"", an extra ability for each class, become available in parties. ""Exp chains"", extra experience granted for back-to-back monster slaying on an ever-shortening timer, can be racked up into rediculous numbers with the help of extra players. Lastly, if you attack a monster in a party, an equal number of monsters will attack *you*. In other words, if a 4 person party attacks a monster, 4 nearby monsters will retaliate. This means that playing in a party can be more rewarding, but it can also be appropriately challenging. Partying is really a lot of fun, but it feels like something extra rather than a requirement.

So far, solo combat seems like the game's weakest point. The first 10 levels of the game don't feel very different from any standard mmo. Where the combat really shines in the beta has been the game's dungeons. Even the earlier dungeons of the game have bosses with unique mechanics that encourage you to react individually and work together with your group. It's unknown what endgame combat will be like, but group play, and dungeons especially, are so far where FFXIV's combat seems to be the most fun. I'd say the game starts to really open up around level 15.

You can level any of the game's classes on a single character, and switching your class is as simple as changing your weapon. There is not really a need for alts. Leveling other classes enhances your character by adding specific abilities that are shared across classes. For example, an Archer can level Conjurer to give them a cure ability, or a Thaumaturge (Black mage) can level Marauder to give themselves 15 seconds of lifesteal. This is a good thing because this allows you play with your lower level friends, re-visit or explore new zones, or check out low-level content you missed, while still progressing your main character. Certain pairings of class levels unlock advanced jobs like ""Black mage"", ""Dragoon"", ""Summoner'. You'll want a lot of armor and weapons on hand for what the situation calls for, so all of it is stored and sorted by slot in a separate, special inventory called the ""armory box"". The armory box comes with a gear changer that lets you save and flip quickly between item sets (and thereby, classes). 

Finally, crafting was a fun and dynamic experience. Each item you produce can have a different outcome based on what you do during the crafting process, and you also can sign up for crafting missions, like ""city NPC needs a new pair of gloves"", and what not. Every 5 levels you return to your craft guildmaster and make some special thing for them and they reward you with something very nice to enhance your craft. Currently it looks like you actually *make* money leveling crafting, but I'm not sure it will be this way at release.



**3. Story**

I feel like all of these immersive experiences culminate in FFXIV's excellent story. The previous Final Fantasy MMO was renowned for its great story, and it really seems to be XIV's strong suit as well. I've already written a lot, so I'll just say that I've always been the type to skip all the quest text in mmos, but FFXIV has been quite the exception. The localization is simply amazing, too. Definitely not one to be missed!


Anyway, I'm interested to hear what other people's thoughts are on the game, and what people's reactions are to what I've said. See you in the comments :)

They said to crosspost it to here, I assume that means just to post it here too?  Sorry if that's not the case.


I'm in my 60's and retired, and when he was a kid we played the Nintendo together a bit. I still get around OK, but not nearly like I used to, so I think he got it for me as something to do to pass the time. He got me a baseball game for it, and taught me how to play it. I enjoy the game, it's very realistic, he even helped me create a game version of myself when I was young, which was a bit bizarre.

He showed me how to charge the controller and how to get a game or movie to play, and even signed me up for some online thing (said it was free), but I guess I'm wondering what other games might be interesting? I don't think I could do anything too complex, it took me a long time to learn the baseball game, but I wouldn't mind trying something else out, maybe that I could casually pick up and down.

Thanks Reddit, as always


EDIT:

Thanks for the recommendation (all of you).  I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of responses and encouragement.  I'm sorry that I didn't respond to everyone individually, but I want to thank all of your for all of the support and advice.

I'm learning the controls slowly, but this thread has determined me to get better at it so that I can enjoy some of the games you all have so much passion for. My son is the same way, I raised him to be a tough SOB, but he's said that some of the games he's played have made him a little teary eyed. He's a man's man with a wife and a daughter, and I would want him on my side in any fight, so I believe him when I say that the power of these games to tell a story is real.

Thanks to all of you for the recommendations and advice, I truly appreciate it.

Make sure to keep steam up to date if you intend to use this method, I had a period where my saves stopped working until I let steam update itself. Be very careful with your saved games!

**Update**

**I've tested the method in the link below and I can confirm that it works. Make sure to back up your save data before messing around with it.**

http://www.gamefront.com/bioshock-infinite-multiple-savegames-workaround-guide/

Bioshock Infinite does not support the ability for simultaneous playthroughs on different save slots. It only stores one save at a time and the only way around this limitation is to manually move around some files in your Steam folder as noted in the link above.

so I suppose many of us have moments where we pause for a minute, critically look at what we're doing right now and end up thinking ""Am I really doing this?""

I'd expect most of these situations arise when you're grinding like there's no morning in some games, although maybe someone here has other scenarios where the title applies.

Here's my moment of that kind:
Roughly 2 years ago I was watching through a lot *How I met your Mother* episodes as I just got into it. Because just doing a single thing at a time is too boring for us modern people I decided to play some game while watching.

I loved *Dragon Quest Monsters* on GBC when I was young and found out about *Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker* for the DS. Because I had no DS I decided to emulate it on one of the DS emulators on PC.
While I didn't think the game was particularly great I did enjoy it to some degree and wanted to play through all of it.

Now I don't know too much about the normal DQ games but DQM on GBC was already super grindy and well DQM:J turned out to be even worse. Because you want to raise up a lot monsters to combine them to stronger ones (and repeat) you have to grind an ungodly amount of XP. And as a lot of you may be aware the Metal Slimes and further evolutions of 'em provide lots of XP but are a bit more rare to encounter and hard to kill as they have high armor (thus evade chance) and flee quite often.
There's one extra castle area where you are allowed into a Metal Slime and co. only are after successfully passing a really annoying mini-quest where you have to run around the castle for a few minutes, and you had to do that every time before you were allowed to enter the Metal Slime area for a LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME.

In essence, the game made it ridiculously hard to farm efficiently. 
And although I finished at least the most important part of the game already (there may have been an additional tournament after that, but nothing of importance) I remember that I wanted to get better monsters.

Now there was another place close to one of the end bosses where there was a chance for *Liquid Metal Slimes* to spawn randomly. I started grinding there. But it took forever as well...
So again, I was emulating the game, and the 'advantage' of that is that you can use savestates...
I starting using them more and more to the point where I was quicksaving so, that I would immediately run into an enemy after loading (less than even a second). So I kept reloading the savestate again and again until Liquid Metal Slimes appeared. And in battle I quicksaved so, that when my attacks would miss and the slimes fled I would just reload that one...

In the end I probably sat there for 30mins doing barely anything other than reloading savestates again and again and again. I then stopped and just thought:
""What the fuck am I doing here? This is the furthest away from 'having fun' I can get and getting stronger monsters won't really do much for me anyways. I'm not even playing this game anymore, I'm just abusing an emulator... this is... this is just pathetic.""

After that I felt so terrible, I immediately deleted the game and emulator so that I would never touch that shit again.

**TL:DR**
Was abusing savestates in an emulated Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker game in order to grind super efficiently for no good reason and wasted quite some time not even having any fun whatsoever.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_111gex,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/111gex/your_biggest_what_the_fk_am_i_even_doing_anymore/,

As an adult gamer who has a steady job and ''some'' disposable income, I find myself buying a few games a month. (More during the Steam sales) But since I don't have enough money to spend on the full price of a game I usually have a favourite list and I wait for the game to be 50-75% off. However, over the years I have bought a few Indy games, that after playing them, I would have gladly paid much more for the quality and content of the game.

So here is an idea: Steam should have a tip jar service. The tip would go directly to the game producer (maybe Steam could keep a 5% to manage the service) Since giving a tip would be 100% voluntary it would be another incentive for game developers to offer quality content over cheap quickly produced shit.

Here is a little list of games I like so much I wish to give them a tip:

- Bastion (20$)

- The Binding of Issac (10$)

- Braid (5$)

- Defender's Quest (5$)

- Endless Space (10$)

- Mount &amp; Blade Warbands (10$)

- Terraria (20$)

TLDR: I have bought all of these games on sale and they are so good that I wish to give a tip to the developers.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_1hkum8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hkum8/steam_should_have_a_tip_jar/,

I was playing the Torchlight II demo through Steam, and at the end it prompts you if you want to buy the full version to continue with your demo character. Then it opens up the Steam ingame overlay and you're given a choice between Paypal and Google Checkout.

Figuring it would give me a key to enter into Steam to register it, as I've already downloaded the entire game with the demo so it wouldn't have to re-download anything, I bought it through Google Checkout.

All this does is give you the standalone version, not the Steam version, and allows you to link your Steam account to your Runic account -- this doesn't let you play the game as if you bought it through Steam and the code you get to register it through Runic's website is only to play online. It doesn't work as an activation code through Steam.

I realize nowhere did it say that I was getting the Steam version, but nowhere did it make it clear that I wasn't, and I've seen a few people on the forums that had this same problem. Having it all happen through Steam made it feel like I was getting the Steam version, but that's not the case, apparently.

I've put in a ticket for a refund so I can rebuy it through Steam, I'll update if/when anything comes of it, if this has happened to anyone else.

Also, as of the time I'm writing this, we're the **23rd highest for number of users online**, even above 7 of the default subreddits. Considering this subreddit was only launched on November 16, reaching this level of activity and subscribers in only 9 months is quite remarkable, and makes this one of the fastest-growing subreddits by far.

However, with that sort of growth comes some difficulties as well. Specifically, it's important to understand that reddit's voting system doesn't make it so that the *highest quality* things get to the top, but so that the *most popular* things do. These are often very different types of posts. So I think it's about time that we have a discussion again to make sure things are staying on track for the subreddit to maintain its goal: *A place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussions. Submissions should be for the purpose of informing or initiating a discussion, not just with the goal of entertaining viewers.*

We're completely open to feedback, so please feel free to bring up any concerns or suggestions you have, but here's a few topics that I'd personally like to see discussed:

---

### Comment moderation

This is the big one. I'm putting this topic at the top with larger text and a lot more detail than the others because it would be a very big change, and I think we'd need to see a lot of support for it to even think about implementing it. At the moment, other than things that are objectively banned such as links to piracy sites and un-tagged spoilers, we don't remove comments in /r/Games. It doesn't matter if someone's blatantly trolling, being racist, etc. We don't remove it, and just let the voting system handle it. But we've seen some concerns lately with the quality of comments starting to drop here, and this is a potential approach to try to improve things a bit.

One thing to keep in mind is that the threads that generally have the lowest comment quality are the ones that get exposed to ""the outside"" somehow, to non-subscribers. This subreddit is large enough now that if a post is very popular and gets upvoted quickly, it will hit the first few pages of /r/all. Whenever that happens, people that don't subscribe to /r/Games flood into it, and the comments almost always--to put it bluntly--go to shit. There are also various other subreddits that can have a similar effect, such as /r/bestof, /r/SubredditDrama, and so on. It's almost impossible to stop this from happening, even if we did start to moderate comments. When a large portion of the audience for a particular thread isn't ""from around here"", it's always going to be almost impossible to control it. So don't expect comment moderation to save us from those sorts of things, because it probably can't. Unless the admins ever implement some way for subreddits to opt-out of /r/all, there's not much we can do about this, it just seems to be one of the risks of being a large subreddit.

Now, the reason I generally don't like moderating comments is that it's extremely subjective. People always bring up /r/AskScience as an example of a subreddit where strict comment moderation works, but the difference is that AskScience has an objective measure for determining which comments should be removed. Posts in there are looking for an answer to a specific question, and any comments that aren't directly answering that question in a scientific manner can be removed. But /r/Games isn't like that, the focus here isn't on correct answers, but on discussion. And there simply isn't an objective measure for whether a particular comment is ""good discussion"". Sometimes even some of the comments that seem the worst actually end up being a ""trigger"" that starts off a great discussion, and if they had been removed, that ensuing discussion may never have occurred.

So if anything, the main comments that I think are ""safe"" to remove are the ones that clearly add absolutely nothing. Generally just people being idiots and posting stuff like ""who cares?"" or ""yay!"" to news posts, those sorts of things. But those comments always seem to get downvoted heavily anyway, so it doesn't really seem necessary to actually remove them. Getting smacked with a bunch of downvotes might even be more effective than removal in showing the user that comments like that aren't encouraged, since a comment's author can't easily tell that it was removed, and they'll just see it sit there with no votes in either direction.

Thoughts? Would you like to see comments moderated at all, or just continue letting the voting system deal with it? If you'd like to see moderation, how should we determine which comments should be removed and which shouldn't?

---

And some other topics to consider:

**Kickstarter** - I think the ""no Kickstarter reminder posts"" rule has been working quite well for keeping Kickstarter posts from overwhelming the subreddit, but do you think any further changes are necessary? We had someone suggest that we allow a *single* reminder post for each project in its last 24 hours, just in case anyone missed the project when it was initially posted. I think this could be an interesting compromise, and might give some worthy projects the last-minute kick that they need to get across their funding goal, but what do you think?

**Giveaways** - There have been a number of posts recently for giveaways of beta keys and such. These aren't specifically banned in the subreddit, so they generally haven't been removed, but I'm not really sure that they belong here. They aren't informative and have practically no discussion value. I think we could probably just implement a wholesale ban on all ""transactions"" in the subreddit - begging (already banned), but also trading and giveaways.

**""Accessory"" suggestions** - Recently it's been quite common to have people asking for suggestions for headsets, mice, chairs, etc. These are all items that don't really have anything specifically to do with gaming, but can be relevant for gamers anyway. Do you think these are good discussions to have here, or should these sorts of questions be directed somewhere else, like we already do for anyone asking for PC hardware advice?

I've got a very saddening tale to tell here. I'll tell it from the top.

Do you guys remember coming from StarCraft 1 and WarCraft 3? How we thought StarCraft 2 would be the golden age of RTS? How, furthermore, Starcraft 2 would bring a new golden age of modding?

We got a rude shock when we came into the beta. The custom map system was not like anything we expected. It also didn't work. But we trusted Blizzard to fix it. After all they always have in the past right? The game is releaced with record sales and rightly so. It was the RTS of the decade after all. Made by the most popular company out there.

Literally the day after the Galaxy Editor came out I dug right into making mods. I was pretty much brand new to it. I had done a little programming before but no on this scale. I figured out the Trigger editor pretty quickly but the data editor was a new mystery. I worked on my first map, a remake of Troopers vs Zombies called Infestation Sensation. I worked on it for about 3 months when I ran into a bug. Something was creating a random actor. I spent hours trying to get rid of it but to no avail. I then went back over the previous month worth of saves. I was surprised to learn that an actor that wasn't there was now suddenly being created for every single model in the game.

Hence I had my first experience with an editor that was never properly tested. I then moved onto make a shooter and I made a pretty good system, which I was proud of. It took weeks of testing every possible combination but I finally got it working. At that point I learned something. All of this was useless without knowing the data. So I decided to bite the bullet and learn the data editor.

I started by trying Troopers vs Zombies a second time. I successfully followed a guide to make a WarCraft 3 hero system (thank you bifu!) and another guide gave me a few pieces of the puzzle to make a WarCraft 3 style item shop done in data. I also learned how to change the model for the mineral as well as the model the worker carried back. So now I had mules ""dumpster diving"" into dumpsters and carrying back trash cans. This was a world destroyed by zombies after all. I gained a lot of experience with actors doing that. That took about 6 months of my time.

At this time I was starting to notice, on the forums (which I had only made a few diplomatic post defending Blizzard) that people were becoming very upset about the system. I had figured ""give them 6 months they will get it fixed"" and started working on my main project: World War 2 Diplomacy.

I then spent the next 3 months coming up with a workable amphibious system. I even had a promo version of map published so people could keep up on its state of development. To my shock it made it to page 3 in this almost completely broken stage. After 3 months of experimentation I decided to use the system WW2 Diplo/Fate of the Empire has now. It was the first amphibious system in any map. Of this I think I can be proud of. It has served me well and I've had more than a few people ask me how I made it.

So 1.3.5 came out with the ""fun or not"" system. I couldn't believe it. I knew that there were 2 schools of ""fixing"" the system and this solution seemed to come out of the blue. This was the Blizzard we all knew and loved wasn't it? Were they not given enough time (over 6 months) to fix it? At this point my disillusionment with Blizzard began.

I spent the next 8 months trying to organize the StarCraft 2 wargaming community. It started off with having a plentiful amount members. But in long conversations with them I began noticing a trend. More and more people were starting to lose faith in Blizzard.

My biggest moment though was back when the map allowed for 14 players. We had 14 (full lobby!) and 2 left making 12. The lag was horrendous but all of us had a good time. This was classic diplomacy at its best! Everyone ruthless and backstabbing, people fighting over every square inch of territory, diplomacy alliances to take down the superpowers - The glow of people appreciating your work, even though incomplete was what made all those months of work worth it.

However, to quote Q, ""All good things must come to an end."" And came to an end they did. People started leaving. It became harder and harder to get games started. What was once ""log on and play"" gradually became ""log on and hope to god we can get the minimum amount of players"". I continued, off and on, to perfect the map. But my best efforts could not stop what I could no longer honestly deny - the community was dying.

The reason was obvious. It came from the players themselves. ""The stupid popularity system"". Along with that came statements of ""Blizzard will never fix it"". I decided to join those voices. My mother had been a political activist for a while and her aim mostly succeeded (you will never completely succeed against government). I was very familiar with the concept of making noise. Others were starting to do it, I decided to join them. And I am not one who tends to do things by half-lengths. I started out politely enough but it gradually became more and more vile as I watched the wargaming community die. Making a map in StarCraft 2 is no small investment of work and it all seemed to be going down the drain.

I stuck around, hoping Blizzard would eventually listen and do something. I watched many talent map makers go by the wayside. Rod of Nod was far ahead of almost everyone else - having been an older, long-time modder. 

At the same time we began seeing disturbing signs. Blizzard was featuring maps that needed no help and were also very old - having been at the top of the list for quite some time. Then there was the infamous press release saying that the the mapping community had some very talented mappers and some ""great maps"" out there. He even made a list. What did he list off? The first set of maps on the first page. Claiming that the community was ""strong and vibrant"" when we all knew that the opposite was really true was a major point that solidified the idea that ""Blizzard doesn't care"".

There were flame wars between the fanboys and the complainers and people continued to leave the scene - and not a moderator or community manager or developer to be seen. They would disappear for over 6 months and then make a single post in a thread about some major drama that popped up. And people continued to leave.

And then we heard about patch 1.5. Here I was, demoralized and now finally stunned. They were finally doing something. I tried to keep the words that were already being said by many to myself: ""too little, to late"". It was probably the truth but if I decided to go on that assumption then all my efforts were a write-off anyways.

Then I got a chance email from Blizzard support agent.  They were having trouble with my map and they wanted me to send them the map. I saw the email 2 hours after it was sent and sent them the map. I got a real surprise when a senior software engineer sent me an email thanking me for being prompt about the map and giving me a beta key. This was a real boost. The forums were a lost cause and getting anything through Sixen's private line of communication was pointless given that I wasn't among his favorites but now, suddenly, I had a way in. Over 60 emails of correspondence we got some major issues, including ones with dependencies ironed out as well as critical information about issues affecting every single custom model. Many other bugs and possibilities were explored. I made a point of, without ""over-taxing"" the pip of getting this developer exposed to many issues that people were having. At last I finally had a way past the ****ing community managers who seemed to be both corrupt (backdoor deals with Sixen) and playing favorites. 

However it was one of a few emails that I received after requesting something and I got back from this contact that sent me on my current collision course:
""I know you’ve been waiting on the art tools but I haven’t had any news to share on those since we last spoke. I know that they are still being worked on, but we don’t have an ETA on when they will be ready for you to use. Please trust that I will make sure that you get access to them as soon as we are ready. I’m sure you wouldn’t want us to rush them out in an incomplete state. I’d suggest focusing on polishing other areas of your mod in the meantime.""
Now I never did get them. I do not in any way fault this contact. Someone higher up or a community manager made the decision. However I did not know anything about this until it was, in a way, too late. I began porting over temperary WarCraft 3 models en masse and making custom ones of my own. Maybe all was not lost yet after all.

Gradually my correspondence with the contact fell off. As I said before I never received the art tools never got told that I would not be getting them. Still it had been a very productive month or two. A real boost to moral to say the least.

However the community managers proved as obstinate as ever in trying to block all of my attempts to get in. I highly doubt a single post (most of which had turned diplomatic again as a result of my email correspondence) ever made it through - and not just my own either.

Then I learned that two other developers were reachable. I decided to test the water out. I found out very quickly that both of them were rather new, especially one of them. I did not need to be told outright - simply asking questions about various events was able to give me a rough idea that was good enough to work with. Needless to say I got a few lectures about harsh posts on the forums.

Questions about the art tools and one of my friend's speculations gradually became a clear picture of the art tools being HotS only. This, however, was months away and over half a year of development time had been lost already. I was, after all, still expecting the premium map market about the time of HotS - many of us were.

My map projects gradually ground down to a halt because of issues with all of the ported and custom models I was using in all of them that only the art tools could fix. I tried a third one, World War Zombies: Reanimated and that one also had ported models with issues.

So I tried to find other outlets for my energies as I awaited HotS. I found out by my discussions with these two new developers that the Data Editor Documentation would not include any newbie guides and tutorials. They would rely on the community to make those. At this an alarm bell went off in my head: ""...umm... the 'community' you refer to who can write this documentation kinda doesn't exist - its barely a few people"".

Now instead of going off on the forums with a giant expose or something like that I decided to offer to write the beginner documentation myself. All I wanted was it to be on the main Blizzard website. They didn't have anything in the works to replace it and at least it would be visible and Blizzard could say that they wrote something.

I even came up with how to do it. I made it ""object"" based where each ""chapter"" is designed to get the modder to learn how to make progressively more and more complex things. The first one was ""making your first unit from scratch."" I even made a visual he could take to a meeting: http://i1088.photobucket.com/albums/i333/marshallwellington/Data-Tutorials-1.jpg

However nothing became of that and I decided to drop it. Later on I found out that the UI of the data editor was being changed. At this point 2 alarms went off in my head. One: if he manages to break something almost every map is going to break and he will quickly find himself out of a job and two: this is a person who is brand new to the job and the community - he could easily make it worse and what he did modify so far didn't do much to allay my fears.

So I offered to help. I was pushing the wizzards idea and I found out that they were unsure of how to design them. I offered the following:
Break it down into ""component wizzards"" and make a new UI stream-lined around wizzards. For an ability choosing to add an effect would open up another wizzard where you could create the effect. Granted it would mean a screen full of wizzards but you can easily put checks into make sure there isn't a ""child"" wizzard open.
Here was a layout. I broke the effects portion down into 4 ""master effects"" and 7 ""applied effects"". Here were the 4 ""master effects"": http://i1088.photobucket.com/albums/i333/marshallwellington/EffectCreator-MasterEffects.jpg
This was the sort of layout he asked for. But unfortunately that one also didn't work out either.

So there I was. Nothing I wanted to play. Nothing to do with the game. A lot of time already invested into it. Every route I tried to improve the situation turned out to be false.

I'd had enough. So I told the Blizzard forums I'm leaving and withdrew my maps.

They, in reply, banned me from the forums for a year.

I did send an email the 2 developers (the senior developer and the new guy) thanking them for all the help they've given me and those that worked with me. Also showing the new guy that email from the senior developer I kept telling him about.

I get a reach-out email from the forum team. But am not un-banned and no apology.

I'm happy though. The drama is over with. I had some good times and I managed to greatly increase my skill as a programmer. I learned extremely valuable CG skills on top of it and over all I think I gained from all the work. At the same time if Blizzard goes down the drain I won't feel the slightest bit guilty. No one can say I didn't go the extra mile to make it work.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_13ffky,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ffky/the_tale_of_a_starcraft_2_modder/,

1347199169.0,1092,self.Games,zlnws,Is anyone else not a huge fan of the current paradigm of pre-ordering games?,Ensvey,2244,1152,931,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zlnws/is_anyone_else_not_a_huge_fan_of_the_current/,"I feel like I'm in the real minority here. In my day, whippersnappers, we would look at reviews of games, play the demos, or maybe even rent them first, before we decided if we wanted to buy them. Now everybody pre-orders based on the hype and the franchise or developer, and is totally fine with it. 

Just about every game I've pre-ordered in recent years, I regretted. Diablo III and Brink are 2 examples. Bought into the hype, pre-ordered at exorbitant prices, and played for just a few hours each. 

I understand publishers like to be able to gauge how well a game is going to sell based on the pre-orders, but let's face it, in most cases it has no benefit to the customer - just the publisher and their shareholders. By the time most of the pre-orders start rolling in, there's already a release date. If the game was going to be crappy in the world before pre-ordering existed, it's still going to be crappy with the money they get from pre-orders. 

An exception would be indie games, where they might actually need your money early in order to get by. Natural Selection 2 is probably a good example of this - they've had a loyal fanbase for many years that have supported them and pre-ordered NS2 years ago. It's more like kickstarting when it comes to indie developers. 

However, whether it's a huge publisher or an indie title, pre-ordering doesn't sit right with me. I like to be able to know what I'm actually getting before I order a product. And yet they try to pigeonhole you into pre-ordering by dangling tempting bonuses in front of your face. What good are cool-sounding bonuses in a game that winds up sucking? 

Pre-ordering, to me, would be like if you were ordering something from Amazon, but there were no reviews on the site, no star ratings, and the shipping date was 6 months from now. No one would ever do it, and yet we line up to pre-order games. It baffles me. 

Yes, no one is holding a gun to your head and making you pre-order, but I feel like the hype wins out with a lot of people and they wind up disappointed but keep on pre-ordering. I would love to see the results of a survey of gamers, seeing how frequently they pre-ordered games and how frequently they regret it.

Edit: didn't expect this to be such a popular topic! For all the people saying, if you don't like pre-ordering, don't pre-order - well, sure, that was a great option back when pre-orders were just a way of reserving a copy in a store. Now you almost universally miss out on some kind of content if you don't pre-order, be it just cosmetic content, or weapon packs, or other DLC, or even promises of future DLC. If so many gamers didn't let publishers get away with the pre-order scam, then all games would just come out with their full set of content, no strings attached, just like they did 10 years ago. They wouldn't have to trick us into gambling that the game will be worth the investment when it comes out, and they would actually be forced to make better games because they wouldn't have all that guaranteed pre-order income to fall back on even if the game is rushed and sucks.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,1347232939.0,,,True,t3_zlnws,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zlnws/is_anyone_else_not_a_huge_fan_of_the_current/,

The Revenant is a faction Super Carrier, an ultra rare ship with only a very small number in game. The ship loss is estimated to be at 280-330 billion isk, which is the rough equivalent of 8000-9000 USD. This is the expensive single ship lost to date in EVE Online. In the fight Black Legion killed a few other normal Super Carriers, bring the total losses to an estimated 489 billion isk, equivalent to about 13 700 USD.

**TL;DR** Region restriction all over again with no warning before buying, no option to buy region-free version. Please, raise the awareness.

Now guess what? Bethesda goes the same way. Different AppID (the notification appeared just a few days ago, previously the store page stated nothing), separate patches-DLCs-language sets, all that stuff blah-blah.
The funny thing is that you WERE able to buy ROW (international version) previously but mysteriously it transformed to regional shit right in your library/inventory.
It's ridiculous, some people can't even launch the game now, because of region restriction, but also they can buy only this restricted game from their respective region (you read it right: they are allowed to buy, but not to play): http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1416285-dishonored-rhcp-version-isnt-working-in-country-where-you-can-get-only-rhcp-version/
Bethesda did it once with Fallout: New Vegas, when you had to wait nearly a year (maybe even more) to be ALLOWED to purchase DLCs, now this. And there isn't any option to buy region-free game: Retail copies are the same RHСP (Russia-Hungary-Czech-Poland), and international gift when activated from here transforms to the same shit (I guess the same happens when activating some key, bought from Greenman Gaming or some other store).

**update** So, Bethesda, Arkane, Steam and local publishers cose simply to ignore the issue (none of the forum posts, emails etc. was answered). So far only Destructoid wrote small note on the issue.

1370813794.0,1084,self.Games,1g059d,"State of /r/Games: 300,000 subscribers, new moderators, E3, etc.",Deimorz,1554,470,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1g059d/state_of_rgames_300000_subscribers_new_moderators/,"/r/Games has been continuing its extremely-rapid growth, it's only been [two months since we hit 250,000 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bj2of/state_of_rgames_discussion_250000_subscribers_new/), and here we are at 300,000 already. So even with already being one of the largest and most active subreddits on the site, we've still grown 20% in just two months. As we're just about to start E3, which will likely boost the activity of the subreddit even further for the next week, here's a few recent changes and reminders.

### New moderators

As part of our constant struggle to keep the quality up as the subreddit continues to grow, we've added two more active contributors to the subreddit as moderators: /u/Piemonkey and /u/XavierMendel. Overall, we have quite good coverage with at least one or two moderators active most of the time, so please be sure to report any submissions or comments that violate the rules so that they can be looked at. If something especially needs attention, please send a modmail instead, since that often gets noticed sooner (and also allows you to explain the problem, since reports don't have a reason attached).

### E3 ""event threads""

As we did with the PS4 and Xbox One reveal events, we're going to continue having one ""event thread"" during the larger live events, and removing all other submissions related to the event until it ends. The reasoning behind this is that no discussions really take place while an event is still ongoing, only *reactions*. Sites aren't posting analyses of the announcements, generally just reiterations of the same thing that was stated in the event. And similarly, commenters on reddit are only posting quick reaction comments, while still trying to follow the rest of the event. So in the interest of improving overall subreddit quality, we're going to keep everything related to the event in one thread while it's still in progress, and then afterwards you'll be welcome to create new submissions to discuss specific announcements.

There have been some complaints about the quality of the updates posted in the previous event threads, and we'll be working on improving that. Some different mods will be taking a shot at some of the E3 events, and we're trying to learn from some of the issues with previous ones. Running these sorts of threads is new to everyone, and it's more difficult than it looks to be constantly updating with much quality while still trying to keep up with what's continuing to happen in the event.

Please also note that comment moderation will not be done at its usual level in the event threads. Some of the very worst comments may be removed, but it's not feasible for us to moderate a thread with comments being posted at the insane rate of event threads. So if you're interested in more in-depth discussion of the announcements, please wait for the submissions posted after the event (which will be moderated normally), the event thread itself will almost certainly be a lost cause.

### Official /r/Games E3 team

In case you missed it, [last week we had multiple people come forward and offer to ""represent"" /r/Games at E3](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1fgw2n/would_rgames_like_having_their_very_own/). I honestly don't know much detail about how exactly they're going to be operating, but keep an eye out for posts from the users with flair denoting them as part of the team. I'm looking forward to seeing how this works out, hopefully it'll add a little more ""interactivity"" to E3 for the subreddit.

### General reminders

Just a few quick reminders of rules and some general guidelines in /r/Games:

* Please try to avoid voting based on whether you agree/disagree with comments or submissions. Comments should be voted on based on whether they contribute to the discussion, even if you disagree with the author's viewpoint. And if you see comments that contribute absolutely nothing (reaction gifs, personal attacks, etc.) please report them so they can be removed.
* Avoid sensationalizing or editorializing the titles of submissions. The title should not include your opinion on the content you're submitting. In general, using the content author's title is recommended, modifying it to describe the content if you feel the author did not do a good job of it. If you see a title that is misleading or inaccurate, please report the submission so that we can tag or remove it.
* Blogspam (sites embedding content from other sources without adding anything significant) is not allowed. If you are submitting, please check if the site states that their information came from another source, and submit the actual source instead. If you notice blogspam, please report it so that it can be removed.
* Excessive promotion is not allowed. In addition to blogspam, E3 tends to bring out a lot of people trying to promote their sites by posting major news on it and then submitting here. We allow self-promotion in moderation, but the user promoting their site must have the large majority of their activity on reddit be not related to self-promotion. If you want to promote here, you should give the impression of being ""a redditor with a website"", not ""a website with a reddit account"".
* [Don't ask for votes or otherwise manipulate voting](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/). This includes asking for votes on Twitter, external forums, IRC channels, etc. This is against [reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) and will result in your submission being removed. If you see anyone manipulating votes, please send us a modmail so we can investigate.

If you have any other feedback or suggestions about the subreddit, please feel free to let us know. Enjoy E3 week, hopefully there will be all sorts of exciting announcements and information for us to discuss.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,1370814530.0,,,True,t3_1g059d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1g059d/state_of_rgames_300000_subscribers_new_moderators/,moderator

[Ben Kuchera's delightful interview with Gabe Newell over at The Penny Arcade Report](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/valves-gabe-newell-talks-wearable-computers-rewarding-players-and-whether-w) was recently linked by Kotaku, wherein Luke Plunkett (the inimitable and current talentless captain of said sinking ship) proceeded [to take Kuchera's photo of Newell's bearded state, strip off the watermark](http://kotaku.com/5886466/breaking-gabe-newell-grows-beard) and distill an otherwise interesting interview into something akin to a gossip story with less characters than an everyday tweet. [Kuchera is appropriately annoyed](https://twitter.com/#!/BenKuchera/status/171553949227302912), and I'd imagine more than a little miffed that Kotaku's bite-sized corn kernel might generate more hits, interest or ad revenue than the article he went to lengths to produce.

You might say to me, *random Redditor*, if Kotaku is so problematic for you then stop visiting the insipid site. Here is where things become unfortunate. Kotaku's Australian portal, owned by Allure Media rather than Gawker, has proven to be a good resource for local news about our industry. [Mark Serrels](https://twitter.com/#!/serrels) is a damn good gent and a fine editor (he had the decency to ensure [Plunkett's shoddy article kept the watermarked image when republished to the Australian portal](http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/02/breaking-gabe-newell-grows-beard/)), and [Tracy Lien](http://traceylien.com/) an equally valuable contributor. It saddens me that their quality content is so often eclipsed by the blatant idiocy and outright fuckwittery that is embodied by Kotaku US writers such as Plunkett and Brian Ashcraft. Behaviour such as Plunkett's PA Report butchery and [Ashcraft's abhorrent, titillating reporting on stories of sensationalist interest only tenuously related to video gaming](http://kotaku.com/5881909/video-gaming-interrupted-by-sadistic-sisters-cruelty-ensues) wholly embody what is wrong with video game 'journalism' today. 

I'm not sure why I posted. Just sad that the content of some of favourite writers are being overshadowed or ignored by the actions of the shameless shitspinners they share an online space with. Perhaps we can discuss the current state of gaming news reporting and the lack of any sense of standards amongst some of the more popular writers? I'm also aware that I'm giving more hits to Kotaku by linking to them.

What do you guys think? Does purchasing a game on one console free you from the stigma of pirating it on another, or is it just as bad as pirating a game you don't have (however bad that you may or may not think that in itself to be)?

Mine out some stone, haul it to a workshop, make a pot out of it, have a brewer claim the pot and turn it into a barrel of hooch, and then store the booze for a year or two — and if a dwarf who eventually gets a drink from the barrel has a particular fondness for the type of rock you mined the stone from, he’ll enjoy it that little bit more, which genuinely might be the difference between everything going well, or the entire fortress dissolving into a death-spiral of hissy-fit tantrums, and all because a rabbit accidentally slipped and fell into some magma. The emergent game-play that arises from this depth is often jaw-dropping.

Secondly, it’s brutal. Utterly brutal. A depressed Dwarf — down, perhaps, because he can’t find clean socks — might decide (entirely on his own accord) to murder a colleague, drag the corpse to a workshop, and turn it into a skull-topped spine-bone scepter, complete with little decorative carvings of the socks he can’t find. He will be celebrated for this achievement. It might even cheer the victim’s bereaved spouse up. Mothers have been known to go into battle wielding their own newborns as particularly hideous bludgeons. Entire Dwarven forts have been slaughtered by undead clam-shells. Please don’t ask about the Giant Sponges of Doom, flaming elephant madness, commemorative gold statues of the King of the Dwarves lying in a fetal position surrounded by sneering cockroaches, or the Circus.

Thirdly, it’s actually a really satisfying building and maintenance game in its own right. It’s a bit like Caesar IV in that respect. Only utterly unhinged. There are dozens of different possible directions you can take your constructions. Only a couple of production systems are functionally mandatory, and many are profitable for trading, so you can try all sorts of options out. There’s a rudimentary power system available, so you can create devices that Heath Robinson and Rube Goldberg would have marvelled at. These frequently involve lava. Some people construct fractal bedroom complexes — I know, I’ve seen them, and they look stunning.

There are easy ways into Dwarf Fortress. The *Lazy Newb Pack* is an alternate download that helps make installation straight-forward and provides tile-sets and vital tools. Youtube Dutchman Captnduck has a series of vids entitled *DFVIDTUTS2012*, and the first five or six will teach you enough to get started and feel comfy experimenting a bit. /r/dwarffortress is one of the friendliest Reddits I've found so far. There’s a wildly over-detailed wiki. There’s even an O’Reilly book now, *Getting Started With Dwarf Fortress* — “Learn to play the most complex video game ever made!”.

I totally understand that you shouldn’t need to buy a goddamn book just to get through the initial set-up screen of a free computer game. Dwarf Fortress really **isn’t** for many people. You have to be really quite anal, patient, imaginative and blood-thirsty. But if you *are* those things, then do yourself a favour and go watch Captain Duck. Dwarf Fortress is waiting for you, and there is truly no game experience like it.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_wvdi3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/wvdi3/dwarf_fortress_makes_me_happy/,

A long time ago I made this game called Crayon Physics Deluxe. And we finally got the iPad version of the game done. And we're celebrating the release by giving it away for free. You can download the iPad version free from iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crayon-physics-deluxe-for/id551347494?ls=1&amp;mt=8

In the spirit of celebration and Christmas here's a link to download the PC, Mac and Linux versions of Crayon Physics Deluxe for free as well: http://www.crayonphysics.com/free_for_reddit.php

**edit**: I screwed up the usage of iTunesConnect and the game was $4.99 on iTunes for a while. I'm really sorry about that. Of course this happened while I was sleeping. I set it to be free again and it should stay like that until 3rd of December.

1358356760.0,1019,self.Games,16oz7t,"200,000 subscribers! Time to experiment with some changes to try to keep the subreddit on track",Deimorz,1678,659,880,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16oz7t/200000_subscribers_time_to_experiment_with_some/,"/r/Games crossed 200,000 subscribers last night, so today we're going to try bringing in some new changes to help keep the quality up. Most of them were discussed in [this thread from last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16efty/rgames_will_hit_200000_subscribers_in_a_few_days/). Here's what's happening:

**New moderators** - I've invited a few more active community members to moderate the subreddit. So far, /u/Pharnaces_II and /u/fishingcat have accepted, and there will likely be one or two more added soon as well (Edit: /u/nothis has been added now too). Having more active moderators is going to be important due to some of the other changes outlined below.

**New sidebar** - The old sidebar was extremely long and had a lot of the important information buried in it, so I redid it into a much more condensed version that will hopefully have a marginally higher chance of anyone actually reading it. The submit button has also been moved to the top, instead of being all the way down at the bottom. If you're on a mobile app, you can view the new sidebar here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/about/sidebar

**Responding to discussion topics with a game's name and no detail or explanation is no longer allowed** - When someone makes a discussion topic like ""What stealth games most capture the feeling of sneaking around and have the most immersive atmosphere?"", there are generally multiple users that rush to immediately post game names like ""Thief 2"" with absolutely no justification about why they think that's the best answer to the question. This is no longer allowed. *Explain your answer*, or it will be removed. Please report any comments that are just a game name without any reasoning.

**Downvote arrow hidden for comments** - This was one of the main possibilities being discussed in the thread last week, and the main objection to it seemed to be that a lot of people thought it probably wouldn't work anyway. So we're going to test it out and see how much effect it actually has. This is the change that's most likely to be reverted if it doesn't go well, it's very much an experiment.

**Extremely low quality comments will be removed** - Since downvotes will be less accessible, extremely poor comments (that would normally have ended up heavily downvoted) will now be removed by the moderators. So if there's a comment that really, really should not have even been posted, please report it. Note that this doesn't mean comments you disagree with, or that you think are incorrect. I'm talking about things like someone posting ""this game is shit"" on a news submission, etc. Users that consistently and repeatedly post awful comments may also be banned from the subreddit.

**Self-posts/suggestion threads will be moderated a little more strictly** - One of the most common complaints recently has been related to the declining quality of submissions from users that check the new page. There are a lot of very straightforward or repetitive questions being posted, so we're going to start moderating these a little more strictly and redirecting posters to more appropriate subreddits like /r/AskGames, /r/gamingsuggestions, /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame, etc. Self-posts to /r/Games should have the potential to generate a significant discussion.

Feedback on these changes is welcome, as well as suggestions for other changes we could consider.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,1358363117.0,,,True,t3_16oz7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16oz7t/200000_subscribers_time_to_experiment_with_some/,moderator

1342874171.0,1015,self.Games,wx6nq,Valve taking action against cross-border gifters.,lighthaze,1788,773,386,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/wx6nq/valve_taking_action_against_crossborder_gifters/,"Apparantly some of the big players in the gifting-scene (from russia / the US) have received emails from Valve, urging them to stop gifting to players from Europe. On some accounts, buying games has been completely disabled.

I think this is completely unacceptable. For me, buying games via a US-gifter has never been about getting the game cheaper. It has always been about getting the uncut version of a game.

I see Valves problem from a monetary point-of-view (games are cheaper in Russia / the US than in Europe), but I think it's hypocritical of Valve to use the advantages of globalization, while prohibiting its users from doing the same.

As an adult German I am allowed to buy uncut games. Why won't Valve let me? The German community has been asking for an age verification system for years now and we have gotten basically no answers at all. 

Edit: Most reputable gifters never used the system to get rich. All they asked for was a small tip and paypal-fees. Seriously Valve, I am disappoint.

**Edit2:** There seems to be a lot of misinformation concerning the German system. Therefore I'll add some infos on how it actually works.

Basically you have two big players:

The USK (German self-monitoring of entertainment software) and the BPJM (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons). If a publisher wants to publish a game in Germany, the game needs to have an age restriction sticker from the USK. Classifications include ""no restriction"", ""6+"", ""12+"", ""16+"" and ""18+"". There restrictions are legally binding for the retail sector. If the USK thinks a game is too violent (rascist, etc.) it can refuse classification. In this case the BPJM can index the game which basically means an automatic 18+ rating AND prohibition to advertise the game (which includes displaying the game in retails stores). Buying the game as an adult is still allowed, but getting it can be a problem. Some retailers still have such games below the counter, but if you don't want to buy on the Internet you're probably screwed. Again this is not a situation (directly) forced by law, but a decision made by the retailers due to, probably, low sales.

Important to note is that not the German government censors games. The publishers do, as they want to prevent that their game is being indexed.

Now online it's a really difficult case. Basically Steam already does illegal things by selling USK 16+ rated games to teens. But nobody seems to care. German players just want an age verification system that lets people buy games they could also buy in a German retail / online store.

**Edit3:** Games actually can get banned in Germany. This is the third, but very rare case. It mostly happens to games like ""KZ-Simulator"" (Nazi bullshit) or other games depicting swastikas (Wolfenstein), sometimes really violent games like Manhunt. Here selling the game is actually prohibited (afaik not buying, but IANAL). Whatever, this case is not that importat, because it happens very rarely.

**Concerning proof:** I understand and respect your skepticism, but obtaining proof is pretty hard. I basically repeat what my US-gifter told me. A friend of mine uses a RU-gifter (I don't) and he told me the same. They received Emails from Valve that their accounts are being examined for fraud and that they should stop gifting games. Also buying / activating games has been disabled. At least one of them has regained his account completely by now. So it seems as if it was just a last warning.

**Concerning proof 2:** Just talked to someone who can post proof on Tuesday. He's not home at the moment.

**Concerning buying in another countries store:** http://i.imgur.com/QMHnI.jpg

As usual if you have any suggestions for these threads please, feel free to tell me.

Pricing errors occur because the prices for Steam games fluctuate a lot within the first 10-20 minutes of going on daily/flash/community choice sale, for whatever reason. Just let me know if you spot any and I will correct them.

I compiled a select list of games from the 2009 Holiday Sale and the 2012 Holiday Sale, and found quite a few differences between the sale:

* Games in the 2009 sale were a lot older. The average game was a little less than two years old (643 days ex. Morrowwind), if you count the console release date on ports. Games in the 2012 sale are roughly a half year old (186 days), and most were released this holiday season.
* THQ has steeper discounts, possibly due to their bankruptcy.
* The average discount (1-sum(sale_price)/sum(base_price)) on the 2009 sale was 58%, the average discount in 2012 was 54%.
* New games have 25-33% off discounts. Also, the newest Elder Scrolls game doesn't have much of a discount.

Notes: I'm not a statistical guy, and I only compiled a small list of relevant AAA/indie games. I'm happy to insert more if it didn't already take forever to do this research.

**This does not include Amazon, GMG, et. all, sales**

[Video proof of concept](http://vimeo.com/51438866)

What this means, as far as I understand:

Don't use Safari if you have Steam installed for now, it just executes steam:// URLs without any warning whatsoever.

~~For other Browsers: Be careful, if you get a request to open something with Steam and if in doubt, click cancel.~~

Edit3:

**To find out if this is a problem for you:** [Click this link (should try to launch Steam and run Half-Life 2, don't know what happens if you don't have it installed or own it)](steam://runsafe/220).

If your browser kinda tells you it doesn't know what to do with this or googles the link for you, you will be absolutely ok.

If you get a prompt by **your browser** that it wants to launch Steam, you will have to be careful  and probably want to always click cancel until this is fixed.

If Steam/Half-Life 2 launches or you get a Windows UAC prompt for steam buildbot you have a problem.

If you use Firefox see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/11kib1/steam_security_issue_crosspost_rgaming/c6nepgq) how to deactivate this.

[If you use Chrome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/11kib1/steam_security_issue_crosspost_rgaming/c6ngatw)

~~Edit2: You might have told your browser to always open Steam for steam:// links, so you might not get a prompt after all. Check the link below to find out.~~


~~Edit: Test for those who didn't understand anything in the pdf/are too lazy to read it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/11kib1/steam_security_issue_crosspost_rgaming/c6ndako~~

Should have included something like this from the start..

Three years ago, I was working the graveyard shift. I had a lot of downtime, so I started playing the quintessential office game, [Solitaire.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_%28Windows%29) I won almost every game, so I decided to try something different: I wanted to get all the ""tableaux"" (those four lines of cards) built without putting any cards up on the foundations (the outlines in the upper-right corner where you put the aces and stack cards). I spent a few weeks trying, but I always got stuck with a few downturned cards. I eventually decided it was impossible and gave up...

... for a few months. I kept coming back and trying to win, but I always had the same problem: I could build the tableaux *almost* all the way, but one of the cards I needed to finish building the tableaux was always downturned. I started to wonder whether it was even possible to win playing by my arbitrary rules: other card games [could present impossible problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell#Impossible_games); perhaps I'd found an impossible way to beat Solitaire. 

But I kept trying—not obsessively, but in bimonthly spurts. I'm pretty dumb and don't know anything about math or programming, so I had no way to know whether what I was trying to do was provably impossible. And finally, at 11:17 PM last night, I beat the game according to my completely arbitrary rules. I don't think what I did is impressive: it probably just took me three years to get a winnable hand, and someone else could probably do what I did on their first try. But I've played a lot of video games, and this is one of my proudest video game accomplishments. TL;DR, I need to get out more.

1371160572.0,949,self.Games,1gapu6,WARNING: The Last of Us has an autosave glitch which blocks saves [X-post from /r/thelastofus].,cube1701,1387,438,359,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1gapu6/warning_the_last_of_us_has_an_autosave_glitch/,"I got The Last of Us today played for around 3 and a half hours (and it was amazing), only to notice that the pause screen had a message saying ""Autosaving. Please Wait"".

I left it there for a good 20 minutes and still no save. The Save, Load and Quit options are faded out while it's ""attempting"" to save.

So I had no choice but to quit to the XMB or turn the console off. Quitting to the XMB caused the console to restart anyway. 

Upon loading the game, I was roughly 30-40 minutes into the game. 

The same also happened to a friend of mine, and there's a few people posting it on the official forums.

**Until a patch is released, regularly check the pause menu, if you see it's stuck on ""Autosaving, Please Wait"", leave it for 10 minutes just in case it works, then turn of your console and hope for the best**

Hopefully Naughty Dog can get a patch sorted quickly.

1339512833.0,941,self.Games,uxzxo,Don't let the media get away with gamer profiling. Speak up if you see lazy journalism- worked for me! ,,1553,612,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/uxzxo/dont_let_the_media_get_away_with_gamer_profiling/,"[This article from NY Daily News](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-04-18/news/31363404_1_counts-of-sexual-abuse-neglect-charges-marshals) originally had the tagline, ""James Julius Beaudrie, 36, loves ‘Yi-Gi-Oh’ [sic] and ‘Magic: The Gathering."" Later in the article the games were mentioned again, without context. It seemed to me like they simply wanted to find something ""off-beat"" about this already monstrous person. 

Besides the poor spelling, this kind of lazy journalism further degrades the reputation of ""geeks"" and gamers in popular media. Upset, I emailed the writer, Larry McShane. I asked him why he felt it was necessary to include this information at all. To my surprise, he responded right away. He explained that the authorities were hoping Beaudrie would show up at conventions, where he might be apprehended. *Well okay then, that makes sense*. But why didn't he say that in the first place, instead of just leaving that factoid there, context-free?

He seemed to realize the implications, and sure enough, when I went back to the  article, the tagline was removed and the mention of Yu-Gi-Oh! and M:TG was clarified with, ""and may be traveling the country visiting conventions and trade shows."" 

The moral of this (potentially boring) story? SPEAK UP! If you see a journalist lazily suggesting a link between gaming and corrupt morals, say something. Email them or write a letter to the editor- let's not be complacent in the media's demonization of gamers and gamer culture. 

As long as I have your attention, might I ask- does anyone else have a similar story to tell? Is anything being done to combat this phenomenon? 

**edit for clarification** The part of the article that reads ""and may be traveling the country visiting conventions and trade shows"" *was added later* after I emailed the author of the article. I now understand why the information was included, but part of my point is that **this was not clear in the original article** and without context, it's hurtful to gamers' reputations.

There was an update yesterday that has completely corrupted everyone's save file and then when you do restart the game it freezes every single time after you complete the obnoxious training level. No amount of system cache clearing or reinstalling makes a difference. Team 17 has not responded in any way on their official forums even though I find it highly unlikely that they don't have someone monitoring those on the weekend. As of right now the game is 100 percent broken. I would also have to guess that this update was not playtested in the least consider that it's happening to every single person who has the game.

More specifically I'm talking about the likes of ""We Don't Go To Ravenholm"" in Half-Life 2, ""343 Guilty Spark"" from Halo, the first Scarecrow section from Batman: Arkham Asylum, and many other levels. 

Personally, I absolutely love it when games do this. Sometimes it takes me by surprise, other times you can feel the dread coming a mile away, but these parts of games are almost always the most memorable for me. I feel that they are a nice change of pace and keep the game fresh. A well-done, suitably creepy section, where the player walks into an area and realizes something is wrong, can be just as effective at keeping the player engaged than any million-dollar set piece. A lot of times I actually find myself more creeped out by these singular sections than an actual, dedicated horror game, probably because it is unexpected and forces the player to rethink how the game is played.

Now, of course, these don't belong in every game. But the games that do include them and execute them competently deserve major props, and I hope devs continue to do this.

After running through the installer, I noted that the installer had quietly added (it did NOT ask to install it, or even mention that it would be installed) a little piece of adware called ""Aeria Ignite"". And when I went to start the updater, this chunk of crapware started with it. Bonus: It had set itself up to start with Windows via registry key. Didn't ask me or anything, just dropped the key in there. Allright, uninstalled that crap... and now my game won't start.

I reinstalled the thing and did some digging. I found that the game shortcut pointed to aeria_launcher.exe, a 100K stub that checks if Ignite is installed, and if it isn't, prompts you to install it; then it checks if Ignite is running, and if it isn't, starts it; then it launches the REAL launcher, _Launcher.exe. No integration hooks or anything actually useful; just a malicious pseudo-launcher that forces you to run their crap.

Yes, that's right. You can uninstall Ignite, delete aeria_launcher.exe, change the shortcut to point to _Launcher.exe, and play the game without their ""required"" crapware, no problem. So the app does, literally, NOTHING. Just yet another chunk of useless code to potentially cause problems.

Aeria, I'm sure you're feeling the heat from the new competition in the F2P market, but forcing useless crapware on users is a great way to scare off more technically-minded customers. There are better F2P networks with better games that don't make me clutter my system.

Sorry, just had to vent.",,False,,t5_2qhwp,False,,,True,t3_sz6bt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/sz6bt/this_game_requires_aeria_ignite_hell_no_it_doesnt/,

It's been a while now and I'm starting to get the hang of the system.  I've figured out how to navigate the opening screen to play movies and games, and my son showed me how to download games.  He downloaded a game called Final Fantasy 3, apparently we got it for him a long time ago and he said it was one of his favorites, so he bought it for me and showed me how to start it and played through a little bit of it with me to teach me how to move around.  I like it, because it waits on me to think when i'm in ""battle"".  I guess the game we got him was for a different system and won't work on this one, how they got it to be available without a disc or cartridge I don't quite get, but it's there on the system.  

I went out and got two other games, the ""Little Big Planet"" that people said was like Mario (I actually think I'm decent at it), and the ""Uncharted"" games (1 and 2 came together).  I'm having a hard time with the Uncharted game, although when my son last visited he showed me how to turn the difficulty down, which has made it a bit easier.  I still get turned around trying to run and aim and shoot, a bit too fast paced for me, but the story is interesting so far.  I'm hoping I can improve enough to get through the story.

My wife and I have watched some movies on it, I play a game of baseball most days, and have been playing the final fantasy game as it's a bit slower paced.  I like the story in it as well so far.

I personally loved the production value. The whole system of Dota 2 is perfect. I can watch the stream on Twitch, on Dota2.com or directly in the game. 

Banners on the map for the team, an announcer at the start of a game, a panel of 4 highly different and entertaining experts, funny and interesting interviews which makes even non-english speakers open up and clips showing just how crazy the DOTA2 crowd is.


The atmosphere whenever something great happened was amazing. Shouts which silence the casters and players filled with emotions after close matches.



I really was never that much into E-sports and especially not into DOTA, but this event made me get excited to play Dota myself.

alone in your room playing video games is not

Sure, one can argue that they are somewhat influenced by the details surrounding this particular trial, but these people are supposed to be professional psychiatrists. They should know and understand better than most how today's culture plays out, not trod down the usual path of common misconception. You'd think they had done their fair bit of research on games and the communities surrounding them, yet somehow the stereotypes and odd-out cases seems to have outweighed common friggin' sense. 

This was a questioning of the 2 psychatrists conlusions on Breivik's state of mind, as it have recieved quite a lot of critique in the later weeks. They're going through every detail in the report.

Here's a link for anyone who haven't seen it (in norwegian, sorry): http://www.nrk.no/video/dommeren_var_breivik_spillegal/253537FADFFEC100/

And here's a quick and rough translation of what is said in the video above:

**Judge:** You reached a conclusion of an undisputable personality change in 2006. More specifically, he (Breivik) moved back home, started playing World of Warcraft. When you wrote your assessment, did you know what this game was all about?
	
**Psych 1:** Yes, we knew what kind of game it was, it being explained to us by *some person*.  Other than that, we have no form of expertise when it comes to computer games.
	
**Judge:** Do you think the testimony of Breivik's co-player in-game on how he was so immersed in this game, may have changed your views on possible interpretations of what you describe as personal breakdown?
	
**Psych 1:** No. We feel that playing a lot of computer games gives the impression of a working cognitive function. It is however, something completely different to relate to something in real life, have comitting relationships to other people, arrange meetings, go to work in the morning, have a healthy relationship with a girlfriend, or having common social skills.
	
**Judge:** About this period after 2006, you wrote i.e. that he stayed up nights, played a lot of computer games, mostly by himself alone in his room. Could an alternate inerpretation of this be described as being addicted to games?
	
**Psych 2:** Some would say that, yes. Seeing these events seperate from the later ones.

*And then the kicker*:

**Psych 1:** I would still like to point out that sitting alone in your room and playing games, no matter what the scope of the matter, call it addiction or whatnot, is not normal for a man in his 20's.

Sigh.

TL;DR: The 80's called, they want their stereotypes back.

From /u/Sparten57:

Hello! Thanks for this! It looks awesome. Anyways, I have successfully installed the Star Wars Galaxies EMU using my 'Complete Online Adventures' disc. Just thought I would let you know since I haven't seen anyone else post and say that they were able to do that yet.

**NOT SO FINAL EDIT**

I have made a couple of mistakes that I need to address. Firstly, APPARENTLY you do not need the ""An Empire Divided"" discs, but any discs will work. I am not 100% sure on that one, so if anyone would like to be the test subject and report back, I'll give you a cookie. Secondly, if you want to contact me in game, you do not have to use the ""Urland"" bit - that was my mistake, I forgot surnames arn't used in game messages, so just do /tell Soza.

~~We have a guild hall on Tatioone, and a guild. I have the city in my inventory, but we need more people (and money to pay maintenance) before we place it. I am just collecting names for now, so message me in game if you are interested.~~

Disclaimer: **Is this Legal?**

~~100%. For lack of a better description (this is what I was told by people within the community), essentially, the SWG legal team messed up in the EULA and made it so they, as a company, did now own the data within the game.~~ 

Edit 4: Seeing as people are commenting to quote me on this, point out how I'm wrong and that's it, I admit, this may not be the 100% official explanation, so I bring you  a quote from the swgemu website:

SWGEmu works very hard to stay within it's legal right to produce it's software, and will do it's best to never include copyrighted materials, or infringe on any software patents.

Hello /r/games. 

Yesterday, in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1e4p3o/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/) I talked about recently playing the Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) EMU and was inundated with PMs asking me about the game, how the EMU is getting along and what they could do to get into the game, as well as a few people telling me about their stories related to SWG.

So below, I thought I'd answer some of the most frequent questions I had as well as providing as much information as I possibly can. 


**What is Star Wars Galaxies?**

Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) was an MMORPG created by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) and LucasArts (R.I.P.) in 2003. The game was a huge success and even had three expansions created for it:

JTL - [Jump to Light Speed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies:_Jump_to_Lightspeed) that added a completely new level of game play - open world space combat...think Freelancer, but as an MMORPG with Star Wars ships that multiple people could walk around in pilot/gun. [Here is a combat gameplay youtube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcP95zXWDYU). **This is the UI of the NGE not the pre-cu**

[Rage of the Wookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies:_Episode_III_Rage_of_the_Wookiees) - Added a new planet Kashyyyk.

Trials of Obi-Wan. This expansion pack was released just before the New Game Experience (NGE, see below) and, ergo, carried with it some controversy. The expansion added the planet Mustafar and several in-game items, such as the Mustafar player housing bunker.

I would generally consider MMORPGS to be my faouvtire genre and SWG is by far the best one I have ever played. Ask anyone that used to play it pre-CU/NGE and they will be able to tell you stories until you're deaf in the ear, and how it is one of their favorite games. 

SWG, from the company that created Everquest 1 + 2, follows the same formula as other MMOs, however, its mechanics also set it aside. A hotbar is used, and quests are given but there are no levels or set classes (per say) within the game. When creating a character one is given the choice of a starting class (Artisan, Marksman, Brawler, Medic, Entertainer, Scout) and is thrown into the game, this choice simply determines what your starting items/clothing is. 

Quests are handed out through terminals, and if you want to train a combat (Marksman for example), you pick the quest category ""destroy"". You're given a location of a nest and you go and kill it. But, for example, with other classes, such as an Entertainer, I go to the Entertainer mission terminal, and pick up a mission to go into the cantina and get 10 people to watch me dance. 

It is quite difficult, for me at least, to explain the system of classes, but a Tl;dr would probably be: No fixed class, level up what you want; no levels are shown; you can combine anything you want. 

**Unlike with other MMOs, in SWG, it is the journey, not the destination that defines it.** I create my own class, and my own path to the end. I still remember fondly the freinds I met on the way, the exploits of leveling my medic up by sitting at a designated field zone on a battlefield, whereby about 50 feet away, combat between the Rebels and Empire (players) was raging on.

**What are some of its notable features?**

No matter what I talk about in here, I would not be given the game justice, but I'll name a few that make it a truly incredible game:

* Player cities. The Cities in the game are ALL (besides the main NPC ones) player made (Artisans == Architects create the buildings), player managed and lead. Let me put that into perspective for you. You could be driving through Naboo and come across a city...A CITY that players all live in. Medical centers can be put down, cantinas, city halls, guild halls, shuttleport, class trainers. Cities would hold elections over who would be mayor, and I can remember at times a lot of under hand dealings being done on some of the larger cities on my old SWG server (Bria) so people could become mayor. I can't seem to find the video for love nor money, but it showed a group of Imperial players setting up puppets within a rival city (of a rival guild) to bring it down, iir.
* Open guild warfare. When guilds would declare war against each other, it would be complete open combat (think EvE Online). That means that if Guild A was out doing a raid on one of the open-world bosses, Guild B was free to attack them to crap in their cornflakes.
* Jedis and Bounty Hunters. The path to Jedi was not an easy one. Seeing a Jedi was one hell of a rare site. I can't 100% remember what it was back on the official servers, but I do remember what it was like on the previous emu servers. To become one you had to become force-sensitive by obtaining badges (achievements) by maxing out classes or visiting POIs (Points of Interest) such as Jabba's Palace. From there you would have to speak to RANDOM Npcs and ask about ""rumors"", who would tell you to kill X monster, and not give you the amount...You get the idea. On the other side, Bounty Hunters were given Bounty Hunter terminals that let them HUNT PLAYER JEDIS/SITH. It was a mini-pvp experience. 
* Everything is player made. Everything. Anything that you see in game can and probably has been created by a player at some point. That armour that you see someone sporting? Player made. That expansive player city? Player made. 
* From /u/Dividan84: I think you should add ""Incredibly amazing community"" under features because seriously SWGEmu's community is one of the greatest I've seen in gaming. When I first started playing I had a helper spend the entire day with me teaching me all about the game, and then loaded me up with all the items I'd need to start out. We're really good friends now too.
* Expansive Worlds. Each world was, give-or-take, 16km square x 16km square. All of it could be explored and most of it could be colonized with player cities or factories. 

I'll leave it at that, otherwise I'd be here all day.

**Why was there a need for an Emulator (Emu)?**

This is a question that I get asked a lot, and it'll probably bring a nerd-tear to many of the people that once player the game. Before I start, know that I'm speaking from a bit of a bias.

When the game first came out, it is referred to as ""Pre-Cu"" or just ""Post Release"". This is the state of the game that the Emu is in (no levels, etc., as aforementioned above). First we have the Combat Upgrade (CU). The Combat Upgrade was, in most players eyes, a response to the growing popularity of WoW. SWG was perceived as being a hardcore MMO, with it's level of grind and the difficult learning curve that some people experienced, ergo, much of what was there was redone. Although the CU was seen to be a game-killer, in my personal opinion, it was not the end of the world. It did add levels, and made the hotbar images of moves actually look nice, and did some much needed revamping and additions (for example, rebels and imperials could not fight for control of NPC cities). 

The second overhaul that the game through (and it's most controversial and detrimental) was the New Game Experience/Enhancement (NGE). Everything in that game was COMPLETELY overhauled, and not for the better. Classes were COMPLETLY removed and in place, a set number (can't remember the exact) of ""iconic classes based on characters from the movie"" was put in it's place. For example, the Smuggler was now based on Han Solo, and the Medic on some random droid...It's hard to stress enough how much this changed of the game...what made SWG, SWG was taken out to try and appeal to a wider audience. In the end, however, this was what lead to SWGs destruction. I do recognise that the NGE was not the sole reason for SWG's fall. Licensing issues and SW:TOR probably played a small role in the end.

**How do I get into the Emu?**

Everything within the Emu is free. And you can find an installation guide [here](http://www.swgemu.com/forums/content.php?r=179-Install-SWGEmu). Most people use their old physical discs; you can actually buy these online for VERY cheap:

[UK Amazon Link](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Wars-Galaxies-Empire-Divided/dp/B0000694YE/ref=sr_1_sc_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368365865&amp;sr=8-2-spell&amp;keywords=Star+Wars+Galxies).
[US Amazon Link](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Galaxies-Empire-Divided-Pc/dp/B000067FDY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368365921&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Star+Wars+Galaxies).

Those 1 stars are related to the NGE.

Ebay is also a very good place to look. ~~It **MUST BE THE EMPIRE DIVIDED EDITION**. ((SEE ABOVE FOR INFO ON THIS))~~

There are other more...illicit ways of obtaining the game, but due to the /r/games rule: ""Enabling or linking to piracy"" I will not discuss it. 

If you are struggling to acquire a game, PM me and I will try and find a way of getting you sorted out.

**I'm in. Where do I start?**

Firstly, you may want to read some of the tutorials that the amazing people over at /r/swgemu have made. [Here](http://www.swgemu.com/archive/scrapbookv51/tree/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/swgemu/comments/wvkq5/a_starters_guide_for_starters/). Also, send me a message in game, if you'd like! I don't have much money, but I'm more than happy to help out: **Soza**. I'm also gathering signatures to start a city, so if you'd like to be apart of that, give me a shout!

Edit: Here are some of my new player tips:

* Start as an Artisan. Even if you don't intended to be one, you are given a crafting kit for free that may save you some credits down the line. You can quickly pick up a different class by finding the trainer you want.
* Check out the in-game holocron (press alt to bring up your mouse, and it is in the bottom right of the screen). This is the help.
* Pick your starting city as Coronet on Corellia. It is the most populated. 
* To change the resolution and some other options go to: Computer &gt; Local Disc C: &gt; SWGEmu and double click the swgemu_setup.

*[Trainer Locations](http://forum.galaxiesreborn.com/swg-gameplay/swg-pre-cu-trainer-locations-t4068.html): A list of all NPC trainers.

Bare in mind, there are other emulators about, however, SWG-EMU is the most popular one. If you're solely looking for a pvp experience, for example, you can give Galaxies Reborn a go. Although, I would highly recommend the swg-emu simply so the player base does not get even more fragmented. Pvp exists on it.

Edit 3:

I thought people would be interested to know that I will be starting a city. We need to save up for a city hall but if you would like to be apart of it, I need 10 people to start it, and then everyone is free to come and place down their house!

Dear Stardock customer,

My name is Brad Wardell. I'm the President &amp; CEO of Stardock.  Two years ago, you bought a game from us called Elemental: War of Magic.  We had great hopes and ambitions for that game but, in the end, it just wasn't a very good game.

Elemental was an expensive game. You probably paid $50 or more for it. And you trusted us to deliver to you a good game. $50 is a lot of money and companies have a moral obligation to deliver what they say they're going to deliver and frankly, Stardock failed to deliver the game we said we were going to deliver.

While we did update Elemental: War of Magic (you can still download v1.4). Its design just wasn't adequate to make it into the kind of game it should be. So we decided to start over. From scratch. We made a new game called Fallen Enchantress.

So even though it's been two years, we haven't forgotten about you.  This week, we released Fallen Enchantress. It is a vastly better game and, we believe, lives up to the expectations set for the original Elemental.  This game is yours. Free. It's already been added to your account.

You can download and play it by going to http://download.stardock.com.

We hope you enjoy Fallen Enchantress.  Please feel free to visit the Elemental forum at www.elementalgame.com if you wish to talk to me and the rest of the team. We're there and very interested in your feedback.


Thank you for being our customers and your patience.


Sincerely,

Brad Wardell

This post will only discuss the PVE portion of WoW.

Every expansion creates a bigger and bigger pile of useless content and it's an enormous indicator of WoW's old age. It's also a pretty huge issue that mostly goes ignored.

""What's Naxxramas?"" A new player might ask.

""Just some shitty old raid no one cares about."" A veteran player might respond. 

The addition of transmogging, which allows you to use the look of one armor and apply it to your existing armor might inspire people to run old content but at the end of the day you're still looking at old dungeons and raids that will mostly go ignored. What's beginning to happen is that any new players to World of Warcraft will have this catalog of old raids that they'll never get to experience because the only part of the game that rewards you properly is what you do at high levels. 

The thought that Ice Crown Citadel, in my opinion the best raid this game has ever seen, is now rotting away in Northrend is kind of sad. All those boss fights, all the artwork, all the voice acting, it's useless now. Edit: **This is an opinion, good lord, calm down.**

I think this unveils one of WoW's biggest flaws, that is that the game only seems to care about it's current end game. When people level a character, they're going to spend time in mostly empty zones such as Outland and Northrend trying to reach the level cap as quickly possible since that's where the meat of the game is. You won't find very many people in the previous expansions zones because apart from achievements and cosmetic items, there's really no reason to be there. It almost seems insulting that they still charge money for previous expansions when all you're paying for is to level past those areas.

As more and more expansions are released more and more content is going to become junk, I don't understand how Blizzard is okay with this. There is so much they can do to keep it relevant and yet they only seem focused on the current endgame. Part of why people get burned out at the end of an expansion is because the only rewarding part of the game is the latest, why no love for their previous work? 

I've already decided that I'm going to take the plunge once again with this expansion and I'm beginning to think it might be the end of the road for my journey in WoW. Judging from the beta and the previews I feel this one is going to hit all the right notes and so quitting when this expansion slows down might be a good way to go. I'd like to leave while things are still fairly good.

Here is what happened.,,1348,522,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/s3da6/sonic_2_hd_does_not_contain_a_keylogger_here_is/,"Let me start by introducing myself. I'm Guess Who, a long-time member of Sonic Retro, the Sonic the Hedgehog fan community that birthed Sonic 2 HD. I've been kind of in the middle of the whole Sonic 2 HD debacle; I discovered the hack-prevention code within the game and wrote [an editorial for the Sonic Retro homepage](http://www.sonicretro.org/2012/03/guest-editorial-in-which-i-rain-on-the-sonic-2-hd-parade/) detailing the project's troubled development and recent security problems. I highly advise you to read that article before you proceed. It contains valuable background information about the project, and its accuracy has been vouched for by both Sonic Retro staff and the Sonic 2 HD development team.

Last night I discovered a comment left on the editorial by a MrVestek, a commenter claiming to work for an antivirus company who did some investigation into Sonic 2 HD's behavior after reading my article. He revealed that the game accesses the registry and monitors keyboard strokes even while the game is not in focus. I brought this comment to the attention of the Sonic Retro IRC channel; we debated the possibility of the game being a keylogger. After I discovered the locations Sonic 2 HD accesses in the registry, Retro founder Scarred Sun (who was present in the IRC channel) posted an article on the site warning users that the game is a keylogger.

However, when this was posted, we had not actually investigated MrVestek's claims. Since last night, no one has found any evidence to suggest that Sonic 2 HD stores your keystrokes anywhere, be it locally or remotely. Wireshark analysis confirms it does not access the internet in any capacity. I did confirm that the program does, in fact, respond to keystrokes even if you have another window in focus - say, you alt-tabbed to Chrome or Firefox or whatever. So, for example, if you have ""jump"" bound to spacebar and you have Chrome open, each time you press spacebar in Chrome will result in Sonic jumping in the background. Terrifying security flaw, I know. This only occurs if you use DirectInput for input. Opting to use the raw keyboard option eliminates the behavior, hinting that the problem may be an oversight with DirectInput. Moreover, the game also responds to button presses on a controller configured with DirectInput even when another window is in focus (if anyone can come up with a malicious reason for a program to log your 360 controller button presses, please, let me know). It's also important to note that this only occurs while the game is running. It does not install a service or add anything to your startup programs. This evidence coupled with the lack of any proof of any actual *logging* of keys - a required trait for a *keylogger* - heavily suggests that the problem is merely poor implementation of DirectInput. As my editorial should tell you, programmer incompetence is nothing new to this project.

As for the registry entries, the only things stored in the registry are your video and controller settings and a ""Stat"" entry that is believed to track what you have unlocked in the demo. Normally these sorts of things would be confined to a config and save file, but, again, programmer incompetency. While using the registry to store game settings is incredibly dated and discouraged, it's essentially harmless.

Yes, the game triggers an antivirus alert. No, it's not because of keylogging. As I mentioned in my editorial, the game's executable is packed and obfuscated to deter reverse engineers. Trojans often utilize the same tactic to hide malicious code. The fact that this compression sets off antivirus software is confirmed by Avira. AntiVir detects the game as ""[TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen](http://www.avira.com/en/support-threats-description/tid/3488/tlang/en)"", whose description reads:

&gt;In order to aggravate detection and reduce size of the file it is packed with a runtime packer.

[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/file/844e6a8728463533aabafb782fd0703614a93afad632f84cd1d40df40fd0a2cd/analysis/), an online service that checks a program against multiple antivirus programs, vouches for this - not a single antivirus program detects the game as a keylogger. If you're wondering why the executable is packed and obfuscated to begin with, it's not because it is malicious. The programmer, LOst, has a severe case of paranoia and does not want Sonic Retro members to reverse engineer his engine (refer to my editorial for the absurdity and hypocrisy in this).

So, to summarize: **your personal information, as far as anyone can tell, is not in any danger if you played Sonic 2 HD. The game is safe. Any antivirus warnings you get are indeed a false positive.**

http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/03/29/bioshock-infinite-the-video-game-that-lets-you-shoot-robo-george-washington-should-you-be-worried/
 
 
Not gonna lie, just knowing the URL that it came from I was expecting the worst. But after reading, I was pleasantly surprised. The writer of the article takes some of the claims that ultra-conservatives would have problems with and breaks them down at length. I'll put it some excerpts that I found nice.
 -----------------------------------------------

**Is Bioshock Infinite anti-Tea Party?**

*""No. If anything, given that it takes place in 1912, it’s much more an attack on the sort of jingoistic sentiments that motivated Americans at the turn of the 20th century, and that caused writers such as Sinclair Lewis to openly fret about America itself going fascist. Its Christian and Founders-oriented iconography is not meant to reflect the evils of Christianity or the founders, but rather how easily the concepts advanced by Christianity and the Founders can be perverted in the service of authoritarianism.""*


*""[...]In other words, the game is less a dedicated attack on conservatism than an attack on the most dysfunctional elements of American politics generally.*


*""it’s [also] easy to see how conservatives might find the game especially distasteful, given that the the player is required to do things like shoot at giant, mechanized statues of George Washington with angels’ wings made out of American flags, called “Motorized Patriots,” who recite quasi-Biblical statements of faith.*

*However, even these elements of the game make more sense in context. Physical resemblance aside, the Motorized Patriots are first presented in the game as frightening propaganda-spewing robots intended to whitewash the racist and fascist (they refer to Columbia as “the fatherland” much the same way Nazis did) vision of the game’s villain. In other words, their resemblance to George Washington is meant to reflect on the delusion of the people who run the city, who see themselves as latter day Washingtons, not as an attack on Washington himself.""*
 -----------------------------------------------
**Should children play Bioshock Infinite?**

*Absolutely not. The game is rated M, which in video game ratings is the equivalent of an “R” rating.*

Good on you guy. Doesn't complain that it will corrupt our children or anything.

 -----------------------------------------------

**Was the game created by Marxists/atheists?**

*""There is no evidence to suggest that the people involved in making Bioshock Infinite held Marxist ideas. In fact, it would be out of character for the series if Marxists worked on this franchise at all, given its overwhelming concern with criticizing political extremism.""*
 -----------------------------------------------


So yeah. It's a good thing the was able to grasp that this is more a critique on society than the actual philosophies of such. The only disappointing thing is if you were to scroll down and read the comments. THERE are the people complaining and saying ""I will NOT let my 9 year-old play this!"" and ""More proof that gamers are out of touch morons who take this crap too seriously. Why would an adult spend countless hours on a video game unless you were out of touch. No wonder our Republic is lost..Have fun with your childish hobby the rest of us are busy trying to save our country.""

I guess putting up comments on the internet without reading the context it's linked to isn't a trait of gaming websites.

In that time:

- The music dropped out and sound effects are missing, creating a really bizarre, silent atmosphere.

- The frame rate is unstable and randomly dips to unacceptable levels.

- The camera is skittish, perspectives change abruptly and without proper transition. In one fight scenario the camera was so far zoomed out that I couldn't see Kratos at all.

- A container holding orbs couldn't be opened, context sensitive prompts wouldn't appear.

- Context sensitive prompts in general are flakey, sometimes you have to stand in very precise locations to see them.

- Various clipping and animation bugs

Several resets and 2 patch installs have not fixed this. I did some research and apparently this is widespread. The latest patch has caused many people to be locked out of their game completely, it just freezes at the startup screen.
