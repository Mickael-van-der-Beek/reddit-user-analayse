I realized this quickly but my phone was dead and couldn't call my friends who dropped me off. It's 11 at night I have no idea where I am or which direction to go...

I start walking around, trying to get any car to stop to at least give me some directions. I was in some bizarre industrial area where there were no shops, stores, or really much of anything. 

Finally, I get someone to stop. It's a guy with a mohawk covered in tats. He tells me where I am, where I need to go, and that it's going to take me a really long time to get there. I thank him and he pulls away. 

I start walking and about ten minutes later he shows up again and offers me a ride most of the way to where I'm going (about 10 miles). As he was driving away the first time, he realized that I was in a tough spot and was going to have a hell of a time getting home. I happily accept the ride.

We have a nice chat as he drives me up to where I'm going.

It wasn't the 100 SUVs, or middle-aged parents, or ""normal"" people who decided to help me, it was the guy with arms full of tattoos and a mohawk who offered me help. So to anyone who drove past me as I tried to wave you down last night, ""fuck you"" (though I understand). And to my new friend, ""thanks a lot man, you're a life saver.""

1293547703.0,1164,self.offbeat,esk68,For those of reddit who are socially awkward: How to be socially graceful,johnnyshill,2337,1173,632,http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/esk68/for_those_of_reddit_who_are_socially_awkward_how/,"I know it's very arrogant to say I know how to not be socially awkward. But I do. So hear me out! And I'm not gonna just say ""be confident, and don't give a shit"", cause that is stupid and impossible to fake. 

And there are plenty of different ways that social awkwardness can manifest itself. This post is to address the manifestation that is by far the most common and easily visible, the kind that affects awkward people the most.

**First:** You aren't as bad at conversing as you think you are. You know how you go to a party, or into some social situation, and are afraid to talk in case you won't be able to think of something funny/interesting to say? It's like when I went abroad to Europe for a semester: I liked America better as a result, and it isn't because I left and realized all of these great things about America that I was missing. It's because I realized that other countries also suck, in their own ways.

Same with other people. They are all just like you, not always funny, don't always have something interesting thing to say. Here's why this leads to such a big difference between you and them: they grew up popular, or grew up not caring, and *don't view this as a negative*. They just view this as what socializing is, and realize this is what everyone is like, and they don't expect other people to always be interesting. In other words, the difference between you and them is not your *ability* to socialize, it's your *perception* of what socializing is. I can't tell you how many times I've hung out with cool people and no one had anything interesting/funny to say. To be honest, a lot of them are much lamer than unpopular people.

So don't be afraid of that. Don't be afraid of conversations, because trust me, most conversations at parties are much much lamer than you think. They're basically just people telling stories to each other, and most of the stories aren't that good. The amount of shit you know from just browsing reddit will allow you to interest people more than most.

**Second:** This one is easy, you just gotta practice a little, and this is where it gets psychological:

Don't be instantly reactive to situations - give it a second. So many awkward people I see respond to questions/situations instantly. Something happens, someone asks you a question, someone bumps into you. You turn and, with absolutely no thought, in .01 of a second, you stutter out a response. If some girl asks you ""Hey, is this your drink?"" You instantly look at say, ""Uhh no! Oh wait, yeah it is! Sorry, haha...""

It's a state of mind. By that I mean, your state of mind is that you are reactive to situations. *Instantly* reactive. Non-awkward people are not reactive like that. If a situation occurs, they don't just instantly react. They take a second, think, and then respond. One. second. Even half a second; all you need. I know it seems like a small amount of time, but *that is why you don't notice it*... But 1 whole second is *100 times* longer to think than the amount of time awkward people take, and it is plenty of time to organize your thoughts, view the situation, and respond normally. Think about the example with the girl asking if it is your drink. You instantly respond, not wanting there to be any silence, with ""UHH"" and then react, often with a dumb response, that makes you look awkward and stupid. You can't think in .01 seconds - no one can - and this is why you trip up. No one can, and socially graceful people don't. Simple as that. If you took one second, you would see it is your drink, and say ""yeah"". Or take two seconds if you want. One second to marvel at the fact that this girl is talking to you and stop yourself from bugging out, then another to think about the question. It's nothing, and you can completely compose your thoughts in two seconds, and then give a good response. Just keep your face expressionless while you think, and talk nonchalantly when you respond ;).

Whenever you go into a social situation, think about these two things. Get yourself in the state of mind where you aren't instantly reactive to whatever occurs. Just think, ""I'm gonna be relaxed(at least as much as I can, which will be enough), think about any situation for just one second, and then respond.""



**tl;dr:** I'm a big proponent of the idea that often when people say, ""I suck at something"", it isn't that they suck at it. Its just that they're doing it wrong, and can be shown the light. Trust me, you aren't lacking some magical quality that socially graceful people have. You're just doing it wrong. This isn't really a tl;dr, so read what I wrote. 

**EDIT:** Thanks for the upvotes

I want to point out a certain response from lphoenix

&gt;I realize I've seen that pause being taken hundreds and hundreds of times, by people who weren't worried about talking, but also were conscious that there's some ""acting"" going on all the time in social settings. As I look back, I'm realizing too that what the person taking a moment is doing physically during that moment is very important. And there are a lot of choices. Making eye contact, looking the person over, giving a slow smile, looking away and back, tilting the head, moving closer or back--you can't just stand there paralyzed in thought, the body has to be in the mix, and send whatever message you want to send: flirtation, humor, that famous thing where you make the other person feel like they're the only person who matters in the world right now, all that. It's not just talking. Relaxing helps you be present body and mind, and creatively responsive, not reactive.

This is what I'm talking about, and I didn't mention this, because first you gotta practice taking a second to respond. What lphoenix said will naturally come later, once you've gotten the pause to become habitual. The stuff he mentions, like tilting the head; you won't have to worry about that, that will simply come out, through your personality, in the pause. That is, once you don't have to think about pausing.

**EDIT #2:** I responded to someone with this, and I think I should put it up here:

Here's the thing about confidence: Your brain works better when you're confident. Funny things to say just pop into your head, your brain runs smoothly and as a result you come across as cool. You are literally a funnier, more interesting person when your brain is filled with confidence. And if you need to think of something cool to say to continue the conversation, that will just pop into your head also. 

It's the *fear* you have of failing in a conversation that is the problem; it is like throwing a wrench in your brain: it holds back your ability to converse. In other words, it's not that you aren't confident because you can't think of cool things to say; it's that you can't think of cool things to say because you aren't confident.

The first things in my post should help with confidence once you get that stuff down, hopefully.",,False,,t5_2qh11,True,,,True,t3_esk68,http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/esk68/for_those_of_reddit_who_are_socially_awkward_how/,

Lots of expensive clothing stores, banks, old people, and about 15 Starbucks.

After lunch today, I parked my car, and made the walk back to my office bundled up tight in my hat, gloves, and scarf.  It was pretty cold, so when I had the unfortunate luck of having to stop at a red light, I was pissed.

The light in question was at the junction of a one-way street and a major 4 lane artery, so it takes absolutely forever to change.  After silently cursing my bad luck, I noticed an elderly woman emerge from the building across the street from me.

She approached the curb, meaning to cross the same way I did, but from the opposite side.  The woman, who had to be going on 70, whipped her head around, looking both ways, picked out a narrow gap in the steady stream of cars, and hustled her way across 4 lanes of traffic in my direction.

She looked at me as she passed.

""Live dangerously,"" she recommended with a wry smile and a laugh.

Needless to say, I felt like a total wimp sitting in my cubicle at work for the rest of the day.

And I guess a large number of them came here from 4Chan, I forgot the article where it was mentioned. 

Anonymity encourages trolling behavior. And 4Chan is kind of a heaven for trolls on the Internet. Their users have no identity. Hence, this behavior is evident on other sites where such users go. 

I guess Reddit must work on this issue, as most of the time, and interesting or worthwhile conversation is diluted when teens jump into it. 

I was once a frequent visitor of ATS (abovetopsecert forums)  and I am huge fan of their rules. I am not saying Reddit should implement same strict conversation rules which even penalizes comments using the the acronym 'AFK' instead of Away from the Keyboard. 

But they must have to set new rules where healthy discussion is encouraged and people are 'penalized' for trolling. You can't rely on Moderators alone for this. Since most of them are teenagers too.

For instance, I'd propose to show comment karma of the user along with every comment they make. so that users could generally get the idea what kind of commenter this guy is.",,False,,t5_2qh11,True,,,True,t3_ojnqc,http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/ojnqc/alright_i_am_sick_of_teenagers_on_reddit_i_can/,

I use these every day.,Sagerian,1471,747,604,http://www.reddit.com/r/offbeat/comments/gcdrk/my_list_of_34_general_life_tips_i_learnt_from/,"1) Stop: Stop: Play. Skip advertisements in movies and go strait to the movie. 

2) If you ever find yourself in the situation where you are in trouble with the police, do not say anything and wait for someone who knows more than you do to help. This is normally a lawyer. 

3) At the end of your shower turn the hot water off completely and stay in under the cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. It also helps close your pores and prevent build up of dirt and bacteria.
 
4) Turn it off and then on again. 

5) When you have forgotten someone's name, say: ""sorry what was your name again?"" If they sound offended or even if they don't, say: ""oh no sorry, I mean your last name."" That way you have both of their names and no one is offended. 

6) To peel a boiled egg perfectly: crack the whole thing evenly, then peel it off from the membrane of the egg (the skin like material between the egg and the shell). 

7) Pour salt on liquids that are going to stain carpet immediately after they're spilled. Allow to dry for one day then vacuum. Will completely remove the stain. 

8) Peel bananas from the bottom. 

9) Walk on the side of wooden stairs and they don't squeak. Also works with wooden floor boards. Lifting the door handle as you open the door does the same thing. 

10) Wearing socks helps you take off your pants. 

11) Put salt on your coaster and your fucking cup won't stick to it. 

12) When you get brain-freeze, drink something warm. Works instantly. A not so effective, but still works if no other option, option is to push your tongue really hard against the roof of your mouth. 

13) On most elevators press your floor number and the close door button. It skips all other floors even if the elevator is being called. 

14) If you're writing an article and are not allowed to cite Wikipedia as a source, use the sources in the “notes” and “references” section and just use Wikipedia as a guide.

15) To test if your remote is working, press buttons while looking at the end of it through a digital camera. They can see light outside the visible spectrum. The remote is working if you can see a flash. 

16) Put anon-existent address on a letter and the actual address as the return address. You don't need a stamp this way. However, mail fraud is a federal offence... 

17) If you're making a public address, speak so slowly that it sounds stupid to yourself. Also, bring a bottle of water to the lectern with you. If you find yourself in a difficult situation, have a drink of water and take 15 seconds to get your thoughts together. No one will be any the wiser. 

18) Jump to the left, step to the right, put your hands on your hips and hold you knees in tight. Not totally sure why. 

19) If you need to turn a light on and your eyes are already adjusted to the dark, keep one eye closed and you'll save yourself being completely dazzled. 

20) House numbers on streets number away from the city.

21) If your shoes smell, treat your feet not your shoes. 

22) If you were alive in 2006 you won the 2006 Time Magazine Person of The Year Award. In the addition when they announced the winner they said it was awarded to everyone and made the front cover as close to a mirror as possible. Use it on your CV. 

23) Always walk like you know where you're going. Works exceptionally well when trying to get past rent-a-cop security such as at concerts or festivals. 

24) If you ever find yourself in a situation where you're going to need to fight, be fucking confident; make yourself loud then make the first few hits as hard and as fast as you can. 

25) Give girls presents that actually mean something to them. Just because they cost a lot doesn't mean they're going to like it. In fact if the reason you got it was because it was expensive chances are they won't like it at all. 

26) Learn from your mistakes. 

27) If your Internet isn't working, unplug everything from your modem and wait 30 seconds. Plug it back in. If it doesn't work, restart your computer. If neither of these work, do them again until it does. 

28) You never know when you're going to need details. Always pay attention to the small things. 

29) Don't kid yourself 

30) Know the difference between its, it's, there, their and they're. 

31) If you do not feel comfortable looking someone in the eyes, look at their nose or alternatively focus on the space behind their head. They'll be none the wiser. 

32) Eye contact in general can be used for a lot from comforting to intimidating. It is very powerful. Learn to use it appropriately. 

33) Chivalry is not dead. Open the door for girls and walk on the road side. 

34) Be confident.
