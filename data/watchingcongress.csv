We have nearly 4500 readers already and this is barely off the ground.  I have experienced a situation like this once before and I learned that it is important to keep the momentum going, the next few days are crucial to this community taking off.  Here is the status from my perspective, please give your feedback in this thread.

* **The Bot**

  I've just updated the bot to pull from govtrack.us, they have a simple feed and their summary pages are very informative.  At this point it is just pulling in the RSS feed and creating a self post.  I think we need to improve this to have more summary information in the text of the post.  Even though ideally people will actually read the bills and discuss them having a good summary will at least prevent some mindless comments.

  I've recieved lots of messages regarding working on the bot, so I've posted the extremely basic code running things to github: [http://github.com/koshea/congressbot](http://github.com/koshea/congressbot).  I look forward to the improvements the community can make.

* **The Moderators**

  I appreciate everyone who has volunteered to help moderate.  At this point I'm not exactly sure what we want out of the moderators here, so I am keeping a list of everyone and once things settle we can figure this out.

* **The Logo**

  Looks like we have some great logo ideas posted here, unless anyone objects I propose we plan a thread for this Saturday and the highest voted logo after 24 hours will be made official?

* **Thread Creation**

  Part of my original idea for this subreddit was to avoid editorializing in posts and have the place restricted so the only threads were created by the bot.  I think we need a little more time of open posting while we all organize here, so maybe after next Wednsday or so we could lock it up, and then for the next few weeks we could have a weekly ""state of the subreddit"" post by the mods where we could continue to discuss improving the format of this venue.",,False,,t5_2u065,True,,,True,t3_t1dgk,http://www.reddit.com/r/watchingcongress/comments/t1dgk/the_state_of_watching_congress/,

I have enjoyed how things have turned out with the bot though, and there have been some decent discussions on the bills it is posting.  Plenty of what happens on the congressional feed is boring, but it is great to know what is happening.  I haven't felt like this subreddit is cluttering my front page, it is just a few nice nuggets each day.

Please comment in this thread if you have ideas regarding how this subreddit should grow.  A couple things I think we should discuss:

Should I add additional moderators?  How should we choose them, and what should their role be?

What do we need to add to enhance the bot posting?

Your signal-to-noise ratio sucks. Making people read 40 pages of legalese is hard enough without first making them read through a subreddit full of administrivia.

You should stop talking about doing this and just do it. Let convention arise organically; how are you going to know what works when none of you have actual experience doing it? r/us_legislation has floundered because no one actually got around to doing the boring work.

Government (usually) works extremely slowly. If you don't keep idle chat to a minimum, you will wind up with a subreddit that is inaccessible to people who actually want to keep themselves informed about the workings of their government. You will only satisfy people who want to talk about how to get involved in setting a procedure for staying informed at some later date. If you aren't prepared for the pace of government, you're going to get bored and meander into idle chatter. To maintain a good signal-to-noise ratio, I have generally maintained that all submissions must be links to primary sources. In naming conventions, I have generally held that the submitter should not have a privileged position to opine over other commenters.

I can tell you that bills submitted without a summary get fewer upvotes. Most bills are uninteresting to most people anyway.

4. Have important bills in a special awareness area, which could be another subreddit or a sticky post

I'm not sure if this will work, but this should prevent trolls, spam and get awareness to freedom-incringing bills.

EDIT: Adding more suggestions below:

5. Format for bill posts: [Bill number][Bill name][Brief description]. Inside posts you include the same information, with a bigger description and the exact text of the bill, plus a link to opencongress (Or if we don't self-post (selfs mean no karma, another plus), then we link in the title). We also have the party that introduced it, the speaker that introduced it and where they come from. At the end of posts we include a tl;dr. Of course, the descriptions+tl;drs would only apply for important bills, as it's hard to do a description for every bill ever put through from today. *I think this included all suggestions at time of writing.

It has been quite a while since we had a feedback thread, so why not now?

I've enjoyed the feed of bills mixed into my front page this past nine months, but I think there is room for improvement in both content and discussion.  Please provide your complaints and ideas.

The primary complaint I see is the fact that the bill text is unavailable at the time of the post.  I agree this is less than ideal, but I am not sure as to the best solution.  We can't bump posts when they are updated, so even if we add that information after the fact it could be long buried.  Do we want to queue bills until the text is available rather than posting them as they are addressed?

Thank you for your feedback, and for any code you can contribute (see the github link on the right).

Thanks,
