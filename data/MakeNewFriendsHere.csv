1360906281.0,42,self.MakeNewFriendsHere,18kewz,Statistics warning: I decided to check the number of comments based on sex of the poster...,Lord_Squint,47,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/18kewz/statistics_warning_i_decided_to_check_the_number/,"Well, this post by /u/sencinitas :

http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/18i5vf/its_funny_how_each_female_post_on_this_subreddit/ 

made me curious as to the imbalance between male and female posters vs comments. And since I am enjoying my son deciding to sleep, I decided to do some statistics with a tiny survey.

The basics: I reloaded /r/MakeNewFriendsHere and started looking at the poster and the number of comments. Plain and simple. I took no regard of age, location, topics mentioned, anything. Just sex of poster, and number of comments. (I lied, my son woke up about halfway through this part and started screaming). Since I didn't want to spend hours on this, I just took the first 30 posts that I ran into for each sex, and counted the number of comments.

Some guidelines:

- I didn't count posts with more than one person.

- I didn't count posts that were a random question (what's your favorite food that...).

- I DID count posts that had 0 responses, if they didn't break one of the above criteria.

******The results:******

Average number of comments:

Male poster: 8.9

Female poster: 27.4

Now, some interesting things to be noted:

- There were 3 posts that had zero comments, all the posters were male

- If I removed the top and bottom 2 outliers for each sex: male averaged 6.96 comments, female averaged 22.27 comments. Maybe these popular and unpopular people had mentioned something in the thread that scared people off and/or they were responding in gifs of Ridiculously Photogenic Guy and/or Emma Watson the whole time. So I wanted to kick the top and bottom few to see what would happen.

- The outliers mentioned above were (2 highest, 2 lowest) for males: 59, 27, 0, 0. For females: 121, 114, 4, 3. So apparently even the really boring females were enough to get a tiny bit of attention. Sorry bros.

- My nerd side wanted to complete the basic statistics and get the median as well as the mean. Male: 4.5, female: 17.5.

Disclaimer: This was a super small survey and so obviously could be more precise if I decided to expand the pool of posts studied. However, unless there is a crazy amount of interest, I won't. Again, I did NOT look at subjects of any posts, anything said, age of poster, whether they acted like a tool, even if they couldn't type and were just banging their forehead into the keyboard... I just took the first 30 male and female posts that I ran into and got the number of comments.

**TL:DR Women are more entertaining than men.**

Keep doing what you all do! And I feel obligated to say it: join us on IRC and keep me from being bored at work (button is -----------&gt;). Follow the rules and play nice kids.

So, I'm looking to make a new friend--or new friends, plural. Circumstantially. Which means you need to know who I am. 

In terms of the short and simple qualities, I'm male, young (late teens to early adult range), [INFJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFJ#Characteristics_of_INFJs), and live in New England. 

In terms of, you know, who I am, as far as anyone who'd want to befriend me is concerned, I'm...complex. I'm very intuitive, and often follow trains of thoughts that seem intangible or perplexing from an outside point of view, but this typically manifests as mere 'peculiar behavior'--or, as society more often prefers, I'm a weird geek. 

More relevantly, I'm compassionate. I tend to seek the happiness of those around me without fully being aware that I care. When I do care about someone, I get very involved with the process of keeping them happy and entertained, often going to great lengths to ensure that they're never troubled or upset, regardless of the difficult or lack of plausibility this brings up. 

I have a Steam account--avid gamer--, a Skype account, and this here Reddit account, all of which I'd be happy to friend people on. My interests gravitate toward books and videogames. (I'm a bookworm, if a somewhat ignorant and not-well-versed one.)

And...alright, I'll be honest, I might as well, I'm lonely. Not in terms of the romantic ""Oh, gosh, I MUST have a loving caring partner NOW, or I will COMBUST,"" or anything typically attached to a statement like ""I'm lonely."" I mean more like I...often feel misunderstood by those around me. Which is also common, but what I'm trying to get at here is that I want a new friend who I can connect with on a deep level without being romantically involved with in any way. A 'partner in crime,' as it were. 

Don't feel obligated to share my interests, and especially don't feel obligated to go following societal norms like 'politeness' or 'reservation.' Those tend to hinder friendships which form for the sake of the friendship.

I got in contact with the mods who said it was okay to make a post here about a new subreddit you can check out /r/randomactsofcards. (This post has also been x-posted to /r/needafriend) It's a new subreddit to either give or receive cards to anyone who wants one.  It can also be a good way to make a new friend. 

One of my close friendships started with a card.  I sent a deployed soldier in Afghanistan a card.  It took a month before he unexpectedly replied back.  From there it went to Facebook friends, then text buddies when he returned, and now I have a close friend who I share a lot with even though we live in different states.  Friendships can come from unexpected places if you put yourself out there.


So if you get a chance come check out /r/randomactsofcards.  Make an offer or a request.  Do a card swap if you like.  Look through other posts to see what people's interests are and comment on it if you have something in common.  You never know what might happen. :)

All of our friends have schedules that tie them down and honestly I want to give the opportunity to a stranger so we can make a new friend and provide that opportunity to travel and have an awesome time. Gas is covered by us, as well as any hotels. We would be staying at my parent's house when we get to California where there is ample room.
I don't expect anything in return except for a good time! I hope there are some takers out there who are willing to take this adventure. PM me for all the details. Thanks!

About myself: I am a military professional, as well as my friend. We are both very outgoing, warm hearted individuals. I can provide pictures and skype with you...whatever you'd like.

I'll also listen to anything that you want to talk about, and I'll tell you my opinion if you'd like help with something. As for me, though, it takes me some time to open up. I get a little nervous when pressure is on me to talk about myself. I'm really looking for someone that can be a little patient and not cut and run if I go quiet for a bit.

Joining and leaving in a minute at most means that someone might not have even noticed you are there.

IRC, as described by someone who has been using it for years (not me), is for professional idling. You might have to wait a minute or two to get noticed if no one else is there. I'm going to try to hang around in there and get more people hooked on it, because talking to strangers over the internet is what we do best :)

For example, I joined today, hung out for a while, left, came back, and WFW was on there. We chatted for probably an hour off and on. She's in France. I'm in Kentucky, USA. It was fun! Many grammar mistakes were had because my French is a bit rusty (she was humoring me, letting me try).

TL:DR - Easy steps for success:

1) Click ""Click here to go to our chatroom"" ------&gt; That a way ---&gt; At the bottom of the side bar.

2) Type in a screen name and captcha

3) Wait a few minutes to see if anyone is there, DON'T just immediately quit.

4) Chat with nice strangers on the interwebs! (be smart with your info, not all strangers are nice)

EDIT: If you have IRC questions, I might be able to help. Maybe. The connect button for this one is easy. Hopefully we can't screw clicking a couple of times up too badly.

EDIT 2: If you join, say ""hey"", ""hi"", ""what's up"", etc... IRC usually flashes the tab (browser dependent) when someone says something.

* This summer I'm spending my time applying for work, learning guitar, messing with Spanish on Duolingo, and trying my hand at html/CSS.  
* I like reading! ASOIAF is great, and I'm currently making my way slowly through the Wheel of Time series.  
* I also like TV. ""Anything that's good"" is a pretty broad description of what I watch, but recently I've marathoned Breaking Bad and Downton Abbey.  
* I like lots of really typical things like video games (MMORPGs are my thing) and cats and really supportive mattresses. I also like slightly uncommon things like eurogames and dancing (the I'm-a-dancer kind, not the let's-go-dancing kind).  
* I like eating sweets and drinking bourbon and/or coffee (hence the username, slightly).  
* I want you to be my friend! Tell me about yourself. :)

I prefer penpals over real friends(because It is hard to find mature and smart one, and in real life everyone tends to harass me), so I have decided to post here. 

* I don't really like to talk about what your average 14-years old boy should be talking about. I like to talk about mature topics(stuff like drug abuse, self harm, politics, science and etc.) or have a smart debate. I don't seek to have fun. In fact, I dislike people who want to be inadequate on purpose or talk stupidity just for the sake of laughing. Please, no, be mature.

* I am more like a listener type of person, because I am not that confident and I don't really have much to tell about myself. However, I am open-minded and open-hearted, I have no secrets from anyone. I wouldn't mind to talk about my problems with anyone.

* I am a honey badger.

* I am really into singing(my dream is to become famous singer), Reddit, anime, meditation and videogaming. 
Reddit is my lifestyle. It is like a big freaking club which can relate to any of your interests, periods of life and mood, but better. And it's free. Love ya' all, redditors!
I love playing multiplayer games with pals, but, however, my laptop is cuurently broken, and It isn't that powerful anyways(I can't handle anything more powerful that TF 2, DOTA 2, and Minecraft). 
Final Fantasy XII and Corpse Party are my favorite videogames, and my favorite anime is Code Geass.

I don't really know what else to say, haha.

No pressure to stay for the whole thing if you end up hating me or having to go somewhere. Similarly, there's no need to communicate via speech if you're more comfortable typing.

I don't care if you're male or female or where you're from. As far as age goes, I'm guessing my sense of humour is probably more compatible with 15-20 year olds but I don't care if you fall outside of that range.

Welp, I'm fully prepared for this to get zero replies, but if you're interested just leave a comment or PM me and we can get down to it immediately or at a later time if you'd prefer. Bye!

I'm Kayla, or Jely for people who don't like using real names for whatever reason. I've got a lot of free time at the moment because I'm not in school and I'm still looking for a job, so I'm looking for people to talk to.

I have very bad social anxiety and I'm sometimes difficult to talk to, because I'm not really sure how to navigate conversations. I do try, though, and I think I'm a kind and somewhat interesting person. So, give me a shot, maybe?

I like video games and tv shows. Sometimes anime. I'm watching Attack on Titan right now and I'm also following orenronen's LP of Super Dangan Ronpa 2. My favourite show by far is Supernatural. I could honestly probably talk about it all day. As far as video games go, I'm mostly a fan of RPGs and I might possibly have a teeny tiny thing for otome games shhhh.

I'm also a role player and I really enjoy writing. Sometimes I over-share, as there aren't many things about myself that I care enough about to keep secret, you know? So I might end up talking to you about personal stuff when it comes to me, but don't feel like you have to do the same! 

I guess I'll stop rambling now before I scare everyone off. Comment or message me if you'd like to talk? ",,False,,t5_2vfcm,False,,,True,t3_1jbkqy,http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1jbkqy/17fusa_social_anxiety_looking_for_understanding/,

I'm just really, really sick of all these lonely feels. And I'm sure you all sympathize with that--hell, I have confidence that you all understand that. 

But I'm tired.

This isn't my first post on this sub. This isn't anywhere close to my only post on subs like this. It's not even that my posts fail, that I fail to make friends, it's that they don't...stick. They leave. 

I guess sometimes I leave, but only because they leave mentally. 

And I'm infamous for my rants. Go on, then, check my posting history. It's an irony of ego and confidence issues in the same human (that'd be me, yes); I say ""read my other posts,"" and no one does, because *why the hell would they?* There's no incentive. 

It's the same as the paradox of dating sites--you find a profile you like and tell them why you like them, they see no reason to like you. You find them and tell them why they should like you, they see no interest themselves from you. 

There, that's a sufficiently rambly and nonsensical rant. 

I'm done. I'm just really, really done, and some obscure part of the back of my brain still hopes--dares to dream--that someone will pick me up, drag me out of my self-prescribed doom and despair, and friend the fuck out of me until I'm alive enough that I don't need to depend on the reliability of close friends in order to operate or succeed at any capacity. 

But, then, I'm ironically selective, aren't I? 

So go on. Make your choice. You've got three. 

1. Downvote! Nonsensical post lacking ASL or the norm? Idiot OP! 

2. Comment! You can befriend OP and cheer the poor OP up! Surely!

3. Be crazy! Read OP's previous posts! Mayhaps you genuinely connect with OP? Maybe you'll PM OP and play games and cuddle and talk to OP? Ah, who cares anymore! 

It's a rather simple choice, when you look at it.

I am an introvert who enjoys reading, watching movies, walking, absolutely love shows like Doctor Who, Downton Abbey, Charmed, Law &amp; Order, and Murder, she wrote (to name a few). I am a RPGamer with a decent collection of games spanning a few consoles. I also play, or played, several MMOs. I don't now because I am burnt out and need to recharge.

I love to talk about anything spanning from fashion to explosions to pranks. I am very easy to get along with and I am a great listener. However, in reality (that is, outside the world of internet) I am incredibly shy and take a while to warm up to new people, which makes it very hard to make new friends.

I love gaming, music, movies, and reading/writing. I game on PS3 and Vita, and I'd love people to game with. My usernames are in my posts on those subs, or you can just PM me. I also have a 3DS, but the online isn't working on that ATM. 

I love alt rock, and especially stuff like the Killers, My Chemical Romance, Coldplay, M83, Vampire Weekend, Paramore etc. I like some rap, like Kanye and Kendrick, and I love pop stuff like JT. 

Movies wise, I watch pretty much everything. I'm about to watch Upstream Color (love Carruth and Primer). I saw This is the End recently (thought it was great) and am super psyched for Pacific Rim.

I just finished Neil Gaiman's new book (fantastic, if a bit short) and am now about to dig into the rest of Abercrombie's First Law trilogy.

I live on the east coast of the US, and am currently working on my college campus this summer. I'm a CS Major working in IT and as a student programmer . I have a dark sense of humor, enjoy swimming in the ocean and crochet. Most of my friends leave for the weekend, which means I've been kind of lonely. I would really like someone to watch movies/TV maybe even standup with, like watch it together and discuss it after? Geek out with me/ rant. I don't take many TV shows/Movies very seriously. Most of my friends bond over video games, and while I do game a bit I prefer to bond from talking and watching things. I tend to find that even if you have stuff in common with another person, if there's nothing new to fuel conversation it tends to pander out. So I like watching things with people to hopefully always have something to talk about.

I'm currently in the middle of watching/want to watch:
 
* Buffy the Vampire Slayer(I'm in Season 2 or 3 I think)

* Hannibal (I have 2 episodes left of the first season. I will probably finish it tonight, actually.)

* Teen Wolf (BIG MAYBE. and only to make fun of it. It deserves a MST3K-ing I think.)

* Doctor Who (I stopped after Season 5. I really didn't like Moffat's writing or River Song. But I might be persuaded to give it another chance.)

* Cowboy Bebop (I started it and never finished it though I liked it.) 

For just like a sample taste of films I like: 

* Pulp Fiction
* Fight Club
* Hot Fuzz
* Up
* Die Hard series (minus Die Hard 2, I have a weakness for Bruce Willis) 
* Evil Dead series 
* Black Dynamite
* I Sell the Dead
* A ClockWork Orange
* They Live
* The Room
* Batman (1966 with Adam West. I adore this film, I cite this as the ultimate campy film.)
* Rushmore
* Doctor Horrible
* Avengers verse (I have a weakness for superhero movies. I can talk far too long about superheros. Captain America is my favorite.)

TV:

* Arrested Development (I forgot about this when I originally posted. I am ashamed.)
* Pushing Daisies
* Black Books
* Monty Python's Flying Circus
* Community
* Psychoville 
* The League of Gentlemen 
* Sherlock 
* IT Crowd
* Seinfeld 

So yeah, if you're interested or have any recommendations feel free to PM me and we can set something up. Thanks for reading or even skimming all my text.

So Im interested in someone to talk to, doesn't matter gender/age. To start off, here's a little about myself. 

I'm a female age 17 living in Pennsylvania. I have a rather large family and love my siblings &amp; parents very much. I'm leader of a group of high school students who is against the use of drugs and underage drinking, but we also stand against bullying, self mutilation, and eating disorders. It is honestly my life. I love this group like my second family. However, I do not force my ideals on anyone else. Live and let live. I'm not religious but again, if you are, feel free to praise sweet baby Jesus. It's not my right to judge. 

Alright. I frequently can be found lurking r/nosleep, r/letsnotmeet and r/serialkillers. I'm really into psychoanalysis and serial killers, and my favorite movie (and now the only tv show I've ever followed) is Hannibal. I find psychology intriguing.

I am hoping to go into nursing and work on the NICU with the babies. I grew up around them and I love caring for them, especially when they're so small. 

I can be straightforward and abrupt and stand up for what I believe in, however I know when to back down.

As you might have guessed, I am rather a fan of horror and more morbid or dark subjects, most particularly, of the psychological, cosmic, or Gothic sort. I have a great passion in writing and drawing on the subject, and also with regards to history- particularly medieval and anglo-saxon. There really are few things I don't enjoy researching in great depth, and as a result, I have turned my hand to a range of different crafts and exercises throughout my twenty-three years of life, and am always looking for something new to broaden my base of knowledge. Psychology and the extension of compassion and understanding, to humans and animals alike, has always been one of my foremost passions, as has any observation of nature. Most recently, I have been interested in astronomy, at an amateur level, but I hope to progress to astrophotography, so that I can get a fine photo when the stars are right again. I also have a long standing affection for flights of wild fantasy; games often appeal to that inclination in me. Personally I have a liking for Warhammer, and a range of videogames- provided I enjoy them enough to justify the cost of time- but I would play almost any game in company. But therein lies the rub; my aptitude for living life almost entirely inside my own cerebral cortex, isolated, and alone, has made that company hard to attain, and I feel it is only to my detriment.

  A few of my interests:
*I love to watch UFC
*I love to train Muay Thai
*I love to play League of Legends (until the trolls coming a knockin)
*I love to skype with friends

**Favourite music**
* Lower Than Atlantis
* Enter Shikari
* Young Guns
* 30 Seconds to Mars
* Linkin Park (their older stuff)
* Kanye West
* Jay Z
* Eminem (again older stuff)
* I could go on and on but you get the idea,

I also love all things sci-fi and mysterious so if you liked Fringe or Lost I'm probably gonna like you. However, out of all my interests nothing beats looking up at the stars at night and just imagining how small we are and how big the universe is. Just contemplating how astonishing this whole world is and how lucky I am to be alive, to be given this opportunity to experience life got me out of a dark place in my life.

I like to look at everything and imagine how it would've looked had humans not existed, had nothing been built and it comes close to bringing me to tears of joy with what humanity has accomplished.

I honestly don't expect many/any replies and I have a lot more interests like comedy (stand up and tv shows) but I'd be writing for hours on end and condensed this post as much as possible. But if you do have any similar interests or don't but just wanna chat feel free to post or PM me.

What I'll talk about: Absolutely anything. If you are up to talk about anything in your life, than I love you, since I sometimes just want to rant or complain or speak strangely or be honest or have something who will listen or someone who will just talktalktalk a lot.

What else we can do: Watch anime or tv shows or movies, play League of Legends ( or other games if you have anything that works on a Mac x_x ), share interesting websites, listen to music together, maybe even make silly faces on webcam... and if you have something that you've always wanted to try with an internet stranger, please tell me!

I'm looking for males specifically because I just get along with them better. I've never had a good track record with other women.


I read Terry Pratchett and other fantasy type of books. Love watching anime, Disney, decent horrors, sci-fi and all kinds of animated films. I despise 'reality' shows; toddlers and tiaras, Big Brother, Real women of the OC and all that shite. Soap operas too.


Video games are a massive part of my life. I play all kinds of games. Just ask! I've just started The Secret World MMO and am looking for friends there too.


I am in my final year of Uni, doing my BA(Hons) of Design for Games, specialising in environmental effects such as fire and cloth. I can also 3D model.


I like to talk, am sympathetic, good at listening. I just want someone willing to do the same as often as possible. Preferably daily. (I may sound needy, but that's because I am (: ) I have Skype (no cam or voice, IM only), IMO, Steam and iMessage. Looking to IM and game with. 



Other things you might need to know; single, hetro, probably agnostic (I have no problem with religious people as long as they treat it like a dick ""It's fine to have one and be proud of it, but dont whip it out and try to shove it down peoples throats"".)

Folkloristics, Esotericism (magick, gnosticism, hermeticism, etc), Spirituality, Ethnomycology/Ethnobiology, Casual gaming.

**Musical preferences:** I love music with metaphorical/intricate lyrics and female vocals. 
I don't limit myself to genres so if the lyrics and vocals are good, I don't care if its death metal or hip-hop, I just listen to it.

**Meyers-Briggs Personality Type:** INFJ

I really like reading and I write a lot. I don't think I'm very good at it, but it makes me happy and I'll probably write about you! I love heart warming movies, and I'm a massive fan of Disney and Dreamworks.

I'm also into listening to new music from bands nobody has ever heard of. Not in the hipster sense, but I just get sick of hearing a song on the radio a billion times. I do like Top 40 too though.

- **computer programming** - I am a full-time programmer. Languages include PHP, ASP.NET C#, JS, Java, etc...

- **lolita fashion** - I'm not a brolita (girlfriend isn't into that!) - just love dressing fancy and going to meets with my beautiful girlfriend who got me into the fashion, and fashion in general, in the first place

- **metaphysics** - I love this branch of philosophy, especially when it fuses with the more ""traditional"" sciences

I use E-mail, Facebook, Skype, and my mobile phone as my main mediums of communication.

I am here representing a forum looking for new members. We're a nice bunch who love talking about almost anything and have members from all over the world. We've been in a slump recently when it comes to activity and are hoping that more new members will make things a little more lively. We talk about almost anything although most of us met on a film site and are of course film geeks. A lot of us are into gaming so we also skype with each other sometimes daily and play games like Team Fortress 2 or Civilization V together. 

We do a lot of ""events"" too, and currently have a Murder Mystery going on. Sadly since it's going on we can't have any more players added =[. Unless of course enough people join that the host decides to add in another killer from a second group of players. That could be fun.

Preferably looking for people 18+ as that is the age of our current youngest member. 

Also thought I'd mention we're about 65% male. Not sure if that matters to you. 

Anyway, here's the link to our forum: http://korovamilkbar.b1.jcink.com 

You can register by clicking register on the top right I believe. After making an account you can go to the forum labeled ""General Discussion"" and within that forum there is a subforum called ""Introductions"". You click Make a New Topic on the right side in that forum and you can post a little about yourself and we'll all stop in to say hello! I'm not sure if you can see the forum without making an account first, so you should probably make an account even if all you want to do is lurk. 

I figured this was a cool way for some of you to make a ton of friends at once! It would also be cool if you mentioned that I linked you there in your intro =p. My name is currently ""Saint Benjamin"" on there by the way. My real name is Tim. 

Also any people in Ohio near the Columbus area, feel free to message me if looking for some IRL friends. Not that I don't consider my internet friends IRL friends, I'm actually visiting one of them in the summer.  

Hope to see you on the forum, and if you want to know more before joining feel free to message me here!

I'm a 25-yr-old girl from Germany looking for people that I can hopefully develop fun, long-lasting friendships with. I've recently realized that the number of actual, true friends in my life has decreased over the years, for numerous reasons. In addition to that I simply like getting to know/interacting with people. I'm pretty outgoing, extroverted, social and optimistic. I'd definitely call myself a people-person. 

A little about myself: 

I'm addicted to anything audio. My favorite bands are Queens of the Stone Age (anything involving Joshua Homme for that matter), Wolfmother, Guns N Roses, Bring Me The Horizon, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Sigur Rós. 

Whenever people ask me what's my favorite movie I say Fight Club though I do have many favorites. Unfortunately I spend too much time watching tv shows. 

I have eight tattoos and I plan on getting many more. Other interests of mine are reading, cooking, psychology, history. I used to play tennis and I still occasionally watch the Grand Slams. I'm a Saints and Giants fan but I wouldn't call myself an expert when it comes to football.

My humor is a little weird at times but anything cracks me up really, I'm pretty silly and giggly. 

If any of you want to get to know me feel free to comment or PM me. I have Skype or we can just use emails or Facebook.

After a couple difficult games lately I think it'd be great to just have some new people to play with. Whether you're new and want some basic help, around my level and want to get better with me, or experienced players who can coach me and help me improve, I'd love to hear from you. :) If you're new or want to try out the game, I also have a low level account I could play with you.

Of course I'd like it if we were friends as well so a little about me- I'm a junior in college and I enjoy music, anime, and movies. Talking on Skype during our games would be fun, but definitely not required if you'd rather not.

Hope to hear from you guys! :)

Hello everyone! I'm looking to make friends with similar interests as I don't often get to talk about the things I love with many people in my day-to-day life. Let me tell you a bit about myself.



I'm a student in university studying physics. If you've got a similar inclination, hooray! I would love to talk science with all of you. My intention is to pursue a graduate degree in astrophysics after my undergrad. What are you studying? If you're passionate about a subject, tell me about it. I'm keen on learning about the interests of other students.

Miscellany:

* I quite like music. I've been playing the drums for 11 years now and I sometimes like to mess around on the piano, though I wouldn't dare claim any proficiency. I listen primarily to progressive rock, classical, metal, instrumental music. Here are a couple examples of what I'm currently listening to! - [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0NyZPZdOrs), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKeTD8E8Nkg), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWTWM6XUoC0), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rFPXc9sWtDc), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWI0l4I2RaE). Let me know what you think!

* I enjoy reading. I generally read fantasy, sci fi, and nonfiction science. What types of books do you read? Perhaps we can read a book together and discuss our thoughts.

* I tend to prefer television shows to movies as I feel they allow more time for character/plot development. My list of favorites includes but is not limited to: Star Trek, Sherlock, Firefly, Breaking Bad, Flight of the Conchords, Archer. Just started watching Orange is the New Black, but I haven't seen enough to comment on its quality. I also watch a fair amount of documentaries. Anything regarding space is sure to pique my interest. I also enjoy the occasional episode of 'How It's Made' or the like. I did say I prefer tv shows, but that doesn't mean I don't like movies. In fact, there are a few I'm quite fond of. A few of my favorite movies: Midnight in Paris, Romantics Anonymous, The Room, Amélie, V for Vendetta, LotR, among several others. Looking for a tv show or movie watching buddy? I'm your guy. 


* I'm learning to speak french. I'm not very far along, but I'm making great progress and I'm enjoying every bit. Because I've started learning this language, I've been watching French movies to get some extra practice in. If you're interested in learning with me, please let me know. I've been using [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com) and that's been working rather well. Also, the Pimsleur audio lessons work very well.

* I like to go disc golfing in my free time. I also occasionally play tennis and racquetball. 

* My personality type is INTJ. Curious about which type you are? Take the test [here](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp).  
 
* Want to see something awesome? Check out [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKPrGxB1Kzc) video about a creature that lives in the ocean. 

* Here's an artist whose work I enjoy: [Evgeny Lushpin](http://lushpin.com/)

* My favorite Pokémon Gameboy game was Red version. I think Squirtle is the best choice for starter Pokémon. 

* I witnessed the world's longest yo-yo throw. Cool stuff.

* My least favorite house-cleaning activity is dusting. 

What I'd like from you:

If you've made it to the end of this post (and enjoyed it) please post a description of yourself and your interests! Let's be friends.

I am 15, currently living in an oppressed, depressed and unhappy society, but I like to think that I don't let any of those things influence my personality. 

When it comes to school I am conscientious, and I actually^^enjoy_it accept it. My favourite subjects would be English, Biology, Chemistry, Geography and German. 

Apart from all schoolwork, in my free time I enjoy swimming (in a pool, not the sea because my hometown is lame), going out either to watch movies, parties or simply just hang out. I also enjoy travelling and meeting new people so I can consider that I am quite sociable. :)

~~(And even though I might commit Reddit suicide I'll have to admit that I prefer dogs to cats)~~ 

When it comes to music I can only think I have a weird bipolar thing going: I enjoy indie and hard rock, in languages like French and German, and all in the same playlist because I can.

I also read books, currently reading the last volume of the Millennium trilogy.

You can hit me up any time, regardless of age or gender (as I am not going to sleep with any of you) to talk about anything you like, I'd love it if you said a little something about yourself there too. 

thanks and have a lovely time. you're awesome!

I'm a HUGE movie/TV buff - I own literally hundreds of DVDS from many different genres (I have a particular fondness for horror and crime movies. But I also love musicals!). I've been told I have an encyclopediac knowledge of movies - my friends have referred to me as a ""walking, talking IMDB."" Some of my favorite movies include Goodfellas, Let the Right One In, Moulin Rouge, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Inglorious Basterds. Oh, and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is AMAZING. 

So if you're a movie/TV buff (or if you'd just like to talk to me about your own interests), I'd love to talk to you. I'm also into a bunch of television shows (some of my favorite shows include Doctor Who, Parks and Recreation, Breaking Bad, and Hannibal), so we can talk about those, too.

I'm also a fan of Steam gaming - The Walking Dead game from Telltale Games was incredible! Some of my other interests are nature, hiking, and adorable animals. 

PM me if you're interested in chatting. Since I'm a straight guy, if you're a girl (and at least 18 or older), you get bonus points if you include a picture of yourself with your message - I always like putting a face to the user name, and I will, of course, send you one of my face in return.

This is a throwaway and this request is a super long shot but here it goes:

 So my date for this wedding completely flaked on me and doesn't really deserve to go anyhow. I need a date for the wedding that preferable knows how to drive manual and is willing to take this awesome roadtrip with me and a good friend of mine. You would be gone from the 1st of June thru the 16th and we would be taking some awesome adventures. 

Why did I turn to reddit? All of our friends have schedules that tie them down and honestly I want to give the opportunity to a stranger so we can make a new friend and to enjoy learning about them while traveling across the US. Gas is covered by us, as well as any hotels. We would be staying at my parent's house when we get to California where there is ample room. 

I don't expect anything in return except for a good time! I hope there are some takers out there who are willing to take this adventure. PM me for all the details. Thanks!

EDIT: I am a military professional, as well as my friend. We are both very outgoing, warm hearted individuals. I can provide pictures and skype with you...whatever you'd like. (As well as the whole background story of course!) I am a male looking for a female and I am 22.",,False,,t5_2vfcm,1368040066.0,,,True,t3_1dwix3,http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1dwix3/looking_for_a_date_to_wedding_an_an_epic_road/,

1367444770.0,7,self.MakeNewFriendsHere,1dic9k,35/M/Toronto. Evening strolls or simply shooting the shit by the Harbourfront?,teeohent,10,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1dic9k/35mtoronto_evening_strolls_or_simply_shooting_the/,"I'm a very plain individual. Plain as a white cotton t-shirt I sometimes say.

I live in downtown Toronto, am very happily married, no kids, a (mostly) 9-5 job with various hobbies and interests that keep me amused. Not a whole lot of excitement happens in my life, and I try to maintain it that way on purpose.

I'm very fortunate to, more often than not, have lots of free time in the evenings by virtue of my work schedule and lifestyle choices. Almost every evening after dinner and chores, I spend my personal downtime by taking myself for a stroll down by the Harbourfront area for a good hour or so - even when it's raining or snowing. When I go on these strolls, I listen to music, the news, text or call up a friend to shoot the shit for a bit, browse the web, or just take in the scenery and wax philosophical about life and the grandiosity of it.

That's all spiffy and good...so what am I doing here??? I'm trying to answer the question ""Surely there must be others like me!?""

Every now and then, I get bored and go through a sudden curious phase where I decide to try something new and out of my comfort zone (but not too far out!) Today was one of those days, and so here I am! I've sometimes told myself during these strolls that it would be cool to meet someone else who is in the same life state as me.

By life state, I mean someone who doesn't have somewhere to go or something to do in the evening and would enjoy just strolling or sitting on a bench by the water and shooting the shit for 15, 30, 60 minutes or whatever, and then we simply go on our way to live our respective lives for the rest of the evening. Rinse and repeat every now and then.

I'd like to think that I'm a very open minded individual and won't judge you for your lifestyle if you don't judge me. I am mature and immature all at once. I'm old (relative to the the demographic here), but I try to keep my spirit as young as possible, and as much as this 35 year old body and mind can keep up compared to you energetic 20-somethings!

I typically don't drink (because of my unhumanly low tolerance for alchohol), but when I do, I prefer to sip a smokey scotch. This is kinda irrelevant to the topic here because I'm not looking for someone to go have a drink with, but I felt it necessary to state my position on this for some reason.

I smoke cigs, cigars and trees.

I'm a proud Ent, and often I'm somewhere above [0] when I'm on a stroll, but please don't expect me to share trees with a stranger whom I just met via the internet. That's not going to work well at all. You might be a cop, you might not. There's no way I will be able to tell. If we ever hit up a smoke lounge, then sure whatever, but out in the open in a public space, sorry...byob. I will *not* share/sell trees. Period. Please understand that this is a firm position that I'm taking for my own safety. It's unfortunate, but I feel it is a reality of the current state of affairs on this front.  I would prefer meeting ent-friendly people, but they don't have to be ents themselves.

I'm not interested in organized meetups or group get togethers. That's a different aspect of my life that has already been fulfilled by my occassional participation in local photography club meetups.

One might ask: where's yo' wife in all of this? She likes to spend her downtime in different ways (prime time TV, hitting the gym, browsing the web at home). That's perfectly fine by me. Everyone needs a bit of personal time to themselves to keep things peaceful. That's the philosophy that both of us have settled into for as long as I can remember.

My social network is quite 'complete.' I have a great network of close friends as well as an obligatory 'best friend', but none of them live within random 'hangout' distance anymore that doesn't require scheduling them a week or two in advance. They're also all in a different stage of life than I, and many have entered into a cycle of constantly being busy for various reasons (active lifestyle, kids, prefer to stay home, etc.) I'm understanding. It's all good.

Still, I am Charlie Brown left by himself at the end of the party wondering ""Where did everyone go?""

I may possibly be among the most lonely, and at the same time not-lonely, people in downtown T.O.!

I always enjoy meeting new and friendly people, and I'm a better listener than a story teller, but I can babble with the best of them as well if in the right mood and on a topic that I have a thing or two to talk about, which is varied.

As the saying goes: The scope of my interests are a kilometre wide, but an inch thick.

Lastly, I am a regular on Reddit, but this is an alternate account. What do I got to hide? I don't know. It just felt right to post anonymously. :)

So with all that said...if you're the type that likes to do what I do, and it doesn't matter if you're a guy or a gal, hit me up and maybe we can amuse one another for a bit if the stars align properly.

I'd rather not advertise myself. I did that a bit in my old post, and if you really want to see me advertise my better qualities in such a way as to motivate you to talk to me, feel free to click that attractive blue link up there. Don't worry, I'll wait. 

Good? Great. I decided to crack down and be a bit more specific here. Though I made a number of valuable and comforting friends last time around, I'm less looking for new friends, this time, and more looking for a...a partner in crime, of sorts. Someone to talk to and trust, yes, but also someone whose hobbies sync enough with mine that we can collaborate. I'm talking, like, playing hour-long dubstep or drum n' bass mixes on [Beat Hazard](http://www.humblebundle.com), and, I dunno, designing videogames together, or collab writing projects. 

Or stuff less intimate than that--I understand collaboration isn't everyone's gig. I wouldn't usually say it's mine, even. But someone to bounce ideas off of, and be able to do that in a trustworthy manner, would be...nice. It'd be nice. 

The following is stuff that *should not discourage you from saying hi,* but does point out qualities that are closer to what I'm aiming for here. Even if you don't hit a single one of these, if you want to speak up, ***for god's sake, speak up.***

A Steam account would be nice. Steam games would be even nicer. (Did I mention gaming, yet?)

A Skype account would be nice. More for convenience than for the implication that I want to videochat with anyone, mind you--though such is a possibility, it's remote, until the hazy unknown future. 

Bookworms are cool. (Hey, you. Yeah, you, thinking you're not a bookworm. You're a bookworm.) 

N-doms are cool. That's psychology talk, for those confused, so to put it in more universally comprehensible terms, ENTPs, ENFPs, INFJs, and INTJs are cool. 

Alright, this post is suitably lengthier than I'd ever hoped it to be, so I'll cut myself off, now. As a closing thought, I'll just reiterate: 

Don't. Hesitate. To. Say. Hi. The absolute worse thing that happens is that we don't have a meaningful conversation, and in the grand scope of bad things that can happen, that's really not very painful.

I'm a Canadian born and raised in the nice, warm place known as northern Alberta. I've never traveled much, but I'm planning on vacationing to Taiwan for a month or two in 2015 when I finally get some time off work. I figured it would be great to make a few friends to visit during that time!

I am ethnic Chinese, so I was taught Mandarin as a child, though I can't really speak all too well anymore and only understand very basic Chinese. I am open to a sort of language and cultural exchange. I think it would be a bit fun teaching English if that's something you might like me to help you with.

I would love to learn as much as I can about Taiwan to prepare for my trip and maybe even get a few ideas for locations to visit. I figure that you never know there's a place that locals know about that's never mentioned elsewhere!

I'll toss out a bit about me if you're interested. I'm sure there's something we'll have in common. I have way too many hobbies, including knitting, computer gaming, fire spinning, lock sport, Warhammer miniature conversions/painting and photography. I have a passion for anthropology and the engineering fields, though I have absolutely no formal training on either.

My favorite music is instrumental, post rock, though I can listen to absolutely anything (maybe minus death metal). My favorite artists are Modest Mouse, Kashiwa Daisuke, God is an Astronaut and World's End Girlfriend. I don't watch very many movies or much television, so it's unfortunate I'm pretty ignorant of media culture in general.

In all honesty, I'm pretty open to talking about anything and I'd love to learn anything any everything about anybody. I like learning things, plain and simple. Just give me a shout!

* Indie games, FPSs (not much time to play nowadays though)
* Stand-up comedy (Louis CK! Sarah Silverman!)
* All kinds of music (anything from Bach to Daft Punk and Queen)
* Acapella music (sang in a choir for 13 years)
* Playing the piano (played for 10 years when I was a kid, just recently started again)
* New and shiny gadgets
* Jogging, hiking and biking, seeing new places

Stuff I'm not so comfortable with:

* Small talk
* Large crowds
* Aggressive sports
* Getting drunk for no reason
* Going to bars just to ""pick up women"" (I'd prefer to have a real intelligent conversation)
* Bothering other people about my problems (this post counts as such ;)

I currently reside in San Diego, I'm a photographer and avid gamer. I generally tend to mix up the two with my own art, I've currently been creeping into the Cosplay photography lately. I'm also a writer/contributor to a online geek-culture blog.
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how to go on with this post, so I guess I'll just start with the basics? I'm heavily into art as stated above. Mainly photography, I've dabbled in film, I loved it but honestly it grows expensive. I've most definitely have been using polaroids whenever I can buy the film in bulk (how hipster of me, eh?). I also currently am wrapping up a zombie photo project at the moment. I'm always up for sharing that if anyone is interested.

Also stated above, I'm a gamer/film &amp; zombie lore aficionado, I do enjoy a good cheesy SyFy film every once in a while. Lately, I've been playing a mix of Fallout: New Vegas &amp; XCOM: EU. As for music? I'm a mix of rock (Black Keys, Jack White, Nine Inch Nails), and of certain rap (RZA, Mos Def, Common).

So my reason being for writing this submission? Honestly, I don't feel like I connect with people my age. Yes, I do have friends in my own age group, but honestly, it just gets tiring of the whole ""Lets drink and smoke everyday!"" mantra and I just wish to move away from that.

For now I'm using a throwaway account incase this just fails or someone somehow figured out who I was from this...., I've had friends before and used to but I decided they weren't exactly good friends and I could probably make nicer, better friends or it took me a while to realise they were dicks. So I don't really know how I should go about this but here goes.

I enjoy gaming but I don't do it to much because I usually end up doing it on my own and have an xbox 360 and mostly old-ish games. Might attempt building a pc if I save up in the future but will probably fail at that. Some of my favourite games would be the LoZ series, pokemon but not for a few years (waiting for X and Y), DeusEx:HR, Dishonored, Metro:2033, Cod4, Bioshock, Tes Oblivion, Dark Souls kind of recently got into it, Halo, there are probably others but like I said I haven't really played anything in a while.

I like anime and manga (Haven't read as much manga as anime) but don't watch as much as I used to, I know of a lot but have either never bothered to watch them, dropped them or haven't seen them yet, I used to sometimes rely on people to convince me to watch something but seeing as I'm making this post...you get the point. Favourites include Gurren Lagann, One Piece, HxH 2011, Mirai Nikki, Psycho Pass, Cowboy Bebop, Fma:B (original fma being the first anime I ever watched), H:Ultimate, Ixion Saga DT, Welcome to the NHK, Elfen Lied, GTO, Shingeki no kyojin is good so far, Btooom, Needless, there'll be others but I probably can't remember them. Manga would be Psyren, Dogs:Bullets and Carnage and One Piece, they're the only ones I enjoy enough to own.

I listen to any kinds of music but mostly started out with rock then eventually metal, or I at least think so, I've never been good with genres. Some favourites are Daft Punk, Arctic Monkeys, Blue Stahli &amp; Celldweller (Celldweller's overall favourite), Close your Eyes, Black Stone Cherry, Get Scared, The Ink Spots, Dean Martin, Nina Simone, Nat King Cole, Jamie's Elsewhere, Muse, Oceanlab, 30 Seconds to Mars, Above&amp;Beyond, Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows, Pendulum, The Prodigy, Queens of the Stone Age, Rise Against, Sonic Syndicate, Thrice, We are the Ocean. There'll be other stuff but I just haven't mentioned it and none of those lists were in any order of favouritism either.

Sports like rugby or mma are what I enjoy watching most, just started weightlifting in the garage, please do not say do I lift xD I used to do karate since I was 4 but it just became full of kids and the rugby team I used to play for had all the players leave. I used to like acting but the place I went to do it just became crap.

I've started reading a bit more, such as the Gone series, Ender's Game, The Sword of Truth series currently Stone of Tears, ASoIaF, The Hornblower series, 1984, Metro:2033, Bzrk, any suggestions are appreciated.

I'm trying to get back into learning guitar as I stopped a few years ago because stuff happened so I'm basically attempting to teach myself online, trying to get better at drawing manga too but that's taking longer so lot's of practice to come. That's about everything I can think of to put for now and sorry for the really long essay you had to read if you did read this, but thanks for reading if you did.

There are quite a few reasons why I could use some new friends, but we will get to those in just a moment. 

My first memory ever is a headache. The worst, most mind bending headache you could ever imagine. It never went away, either. Day in and day out, I had a headache. I was treated by my pediatrician from age five years old for a recurring sinus infection that was never really there. One day, when I was eight years old, I was taken to the local emergency room, slipping in and out of consciousness. 

I was given radioactive contrast dye through a shot into my veins, a benzo to keep me calm and still and an opiate to ease my tremendous amount of pain. I was then put into an MRI machine. This was over twenty years ago, and the technology was not at all what it is now. Instead of taking twenty or thirty minutes, I was required to lay perfectly still for two hours while images of my brain from every possible angle were taken. I was pulled from the MRI machine and taken to a triage room while the images were compiled and read.

I was asleep when my parents were given the news. I had an Anaplastic Astrocytoma, a WHO grade III brain tumor. They could perform surgery to remove most of the tumor and take my pain away and reduce neurological symptoms, but in the doctor's opinion, there was a zero percent chance that I would live past five years. A neurosurgeon was called in immediately. He read the MRI, and his opinion was the same. I was immediately admitted into the intensive care unit, and pumped full of steroids to increase my appetite so that I would gain a bit of weight because the doctors said that I was not heavy enough for the extremely invasive surgery. 

After some time on steroids and opiates, the day of the surgery came. My parents still had not explained to me what was going on, because at such a young age, I would not have been able to grasp the seriousness of what was actually happening to me. They also did not reveal to me my prognosis of five years until ten years later. The anesthesiologist came into the operating room, slipped a needle containing powerful anaethetics into my arm, put a gas mask over my face, and told me to count down from ten to one. I think I made it to four.
The next thing I knew, I woke up in the recovery room of the hospital, hooked up to many machines. I had machines pumping saline into my body, machines monitoring my heart rate and my breathing, etc. My head was shaved, and I was afraid. Nine hours had passed, and I was unaware of what had happened to me.
I was immediately aware that my body function had drastically changed while I was under. My right arm, wrist, hand and fingers were all but useless. My vision was severely limited out of my right eye. My hearing was diminished out of my left ear, etc.

I was in physical therapy for years afterward, but it had very little effect on my motor skills. For the remainder of that school year, I had a tutor who came to my house every day so I would not fall behind in my school work as I recovered. However, as the next school year began, I had severe anxiety about going back. My right arm just did not work, and I knew that I was going to be made fun of for this.

I was right. All throughout the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades I was made fun of, teased and bullied every day. I was sporadically beaten up because I was drastically different from the other children, and had a VERY visible disability. This caused me to become very withdrawn and depressed from an extremely young age. 
When I entered high school in a completely different part of the country, this all changed. I made new friends who were more mature and did not make fun of me. However, the damage had already been done. I had a complex. I had already been on antidepressants and seeing a therapist for years. I grew to be popular, but was still very shy and withdrawn. I graduated high school with honors, close to being valedictorian.

I had dabbled in drugs as self-medication from a young age, to ease the pain of consistently being bullied and made fun of. When I got to college though, it became much worse. I started using hardcore drugs heavily. Cocaine, PCP, Amphetamine, a plethora of prescription drugs, etc. I was in a downward spiral and really didn't care to pull myself out. 

Fast forward about ten years. My fiancé had broken things off with me and I was in a severe depression. We were still living together at this point, and she was making my life as tough as humanly possible. The drug use only got heavier until one morning I had a massive overdose and woke up in the hospital on a respirator, with several IV's in my arms and wrists and a defibrillator on standby. Apparently I had stopped breathing and they were afraid that my heart was going to stop. After I was stabilized and released, things only got worse. I left the horrible living situation and to avoid any more drama, I gave up my rights to anything that we had bought jointly. I gave it all to her just to avoid a fight.

I moved in with a person whom I thought was a good person, but truly was not. While in that house, I witnessed things that no one ever should be forced to witness. I witnessed domestic violence towards his now ex-girlfriend. He pulled a snubnose revolver on a friend of his which ended several hours later with SWAT coming and him getting rifles, shotguns and handguns from all around the house, loading them, cocking all of them and placing them all around him on the couch. Eventually, a SWAT negotiator showed up, but they were unable to reach a mutual resolution. After a few hours of trying to reach a resolution, the negotiator gave up and told him that fully armed agents were coming in to the house with body armor. He also told my ex roommate that if he fired a shot, SWAT would kill him. He was escorted out of the home peacefully. After this, of course, I left because I had finally saved up enough money to move to another home and live by myself.

Over the course of the breakup, friends of mine who had been friends for several years sided with my ex for no clear reason. I still do not know why any of them did this, as I did nothing at any of them. Anyway, I decided to cut my losses and not ask questions. Now, I am totally alone. I live alone, and due to my complex of being made fun of for several years am very shy. I also work an absolutely insane schedule, and do not have very much time at all to meet people. However, if a truly quality person or two were to step into my life, I could certainly make time for them.

I am a busy, young professional just looking for good conversation and people to get to know.

I work as a residential support worker in a shelter for young mothers. I work mostly overnights which has caused insomnia. So for the most part I am up at weird hours and just looking for people to talk to .

I also work as a writer and editor for a psychotherapist. I write her blog and anything else that she asks me to. I would like to be published some day, but I need to come up with something worthwhile to write about.

Favorite band is Coheed and Cambria, closely followed by City and Colour, Mother Mother, and Alexisonfire.

I watch Dexter, Adventure Time, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones.

I don't really like one particular genre of movies or music. I enjoy a wide variety of things and I am always up to try something new.

Any other questions, I would be more thank happy to answer. :)

I'm a university student studying science and just going through life experiencing the things any average 20 year old would. I'm not sure if it's a coincidence i picked now of all times since uni is starting back soon, so, i can't promise much of length since i'm about to get rather busy.

I find so many things interesting in the world, ranging from the more serious stuff like politics, philosophy or economics to things significantly more chill like movies and music, i like pretty much any genre of either, ranging from classical to rap and movies like Infernal affairs to things like Eurotrip. I really enjoy learning things and i enjoy a good documentary as well.  Considering the time here (about 5AM) i am a massive night-owl. I've tried to break the habit and yet i seem to keep drifting back here, so, i'm well suited to talk to people outside my timezone.  

Probably one of my biggest interests is philosophy, it absolutely fascinates me, in particular, i focus on philosophy of religion, so, i'm pretty big on sharing other peoples beliefs as well.  My favourite genre of music is probably symphonic metal but my music library is packed with pretty much every genre and i have a soft spot for eurovision. To relax, i like to walk through some of the nice parks we have here or go for a run, i also enjoy photography. I also like Sherlock Holmes (the novels and the current shows going on about him).

I've recently been home-schooled and thus my typical day at ""school"" is just me sitting on the computer all day...

I don't really have anyone to talk to as my friends in real life have a hard time maintaining a mature conversation and I try to stay away from Facebook. 

Reddit is pretty much the only chance I have in socializing with other people.

I'm Matt, 24 from Adelaide, South Australia. 

I've had a somewhat interesting life, perhaps different from what others might immediately thing of as interesting. My parents are both in their mid 60s, very low income earners, gave up owning their own house 26 years ago when their first son, my brother Brett, was announced as having Down Syndrome with a life expectancy of 18, they left and moved closer to the city to be able to have easier access to the hospital. He is currently 26, pushing that expectancy, making me worried that he is essentially on a countdown, he has listless amounts of health issues. My parents do foster care for 2 children from disadvantaged homes who are also disabled, causing the household to be very hectic, and this is their only source of income, due to my parent's ages. They both also do volunteer work, but getting a paid job has proved difficult, Dad lost his job in 2008 during the recession period, as he was working for a friend's small business that couldn't afford to stay open. Also in 2008, when I was 19, I was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, and went on to have an unmatched donor bone marrow transplant, as was my only chance of survival. I also have a sister, 22. My family now only consists of those I've mentioned, and my Mum's deteriorating parents. That's all of us. No cousins, Dad was an only child, Mum's brother has been out of the picture for years. 

Through my life experience I have been the Leukaemia Foundation's ambassador, representing all of Australian blood cancer survivors, as well as worked on committees to help shape the adolescant/young adult cancer services in Australia. 

My dream is to one day meet Dave Grohl, I've tried for years to contact him somehow with no success.

This is the VERY short version, but there's a bit about me! Also, AMA if you like, I'm very open about my life.

Tell me about you, let's be friends!",24M,False,,t5_2vfcm,False,24M,,True,t3_12mvbg,http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/12mvbg/hi_guys_lets_be_friends_im_from_adelaide_south/,

At the start of this year I wanted to make a change and stop being forever alone. It seemed to went well but it turns out my friends don't last too long, people just disappear without a word and I'm afraid they just look for free entertainment rather than good friend. I don't need help that often but when I do, I find nobody is available.

Now I'm left with one person I can talk to and I didn't take well my last loss so I'm in a bad shape right now. I want to find more people to chat with, maybe find a good friend, maybe just someone to talk to which will keep me distracted. I always try to keep up with everyone, be helpful, supportive and not judging and listen when others have some trouble.

I have wide range of interests which include: anything technology related, electronics, space exploration, science, nature, photography, indie and alternative music, reading articles and learning new information every day. I have more technically oriented mind but I'm open to talk about almost everything including philosophical topics, maybe apart from pop culture because I don't follow that.

I'm undergrad student in molecular biology and study in Moscow State University. I also work in the lab of regulation of genetic processes in Gene Biology Institute. I hope to live in one of english-speaking countries one day, so I need to practice my English.  

The problem is: although I effortlessly read all kinds of text (fiction, nonfiction, science papers, blogs), I have trouble expressing myself in English, since I'm more of a passive lurker. That's why I want a friend who is a native speaker and also has grammar nazi tendencies (to constantly tell me when I'm wrong).  

About me: I love science (duh): all that is strange, unexplained or downright bizzare. Favorite topics: molecular genetics, aging, cognitive science, astrophysics, cosmology, quantum physics. I also like talking about various philosophical themes: consciousness, morality, knowledge and so on.  

As a general rule, I favor long in-depth discussions over the light chatting. I like exploring other people's worldview and arguing about issues where my opinion differs from the majority.  

My more frivolous hobbies include PC gaming (less so since my videocard broke a year ago) and anime. Sometimes I also take photos and videos of skyline from my window and draw on ipad with my finger.  

I'm not sure how this friend-making process works, but I think it would be better if you PM me, although I prefer instant messaging. As far as I can tell, skype doesn't send a message until you both online, so that's a nuisance for people in different timezones, right? Even so, here's mine: rowen_lki.

Besides studies in psychology, I am a cinephile; I love to watch classics and am a huge fan of horror, foreign and domestic. My musical tastes are quite varied as well; I listen to everything from Beethoven to Die Antwoord, and the Red Army Choir to Frank Zappa. Just about anything really.

My biggest hobby is quite controversial these days, but I might as well mention it: I love to read about the technological history of firearm development, as well as collecting firearms both antique and modern.

I like to think that I am a pretty nice person and I am looking for the same. Anyone who respectable, is someone I would consider a friend of mine.

So, where to start? I'm socially awkward with more than a touch of obliviousness, but I try to be the best friend I can be. In person, I'm a bit shy, but you probably won't see that side of me 'cause online I can be a little chatterbox :D However, I almost always prefer to be a listener whenever I can, even if I don't always know the right things to ask (what if I ask about something they don't want to talk about?! &gt;_&lt; ).

I like video games, movies, and music, but mostly I enjoy them with others. Cooperative games appeal to me the most. I love to talk about every day boring stuff (nothing is too boring for me, I promise!), but I don't mind discussing more abstract stuff, like math or politics or whatever. I much much much prefer to agree than to disagree, but disagreements can be okay as long as it doesn't get heated. Really, we're just two people, so what if we disagree on how to handle the economy? And if you want to talk about the stresses in your life, your fledgling romances, your ridiculous boss, your struggles dealing with a disability, anything, I'd love love love to listen :3

Jeez, I hope that didn't turn out too long! I much prefer IM like Skype or Yahoo, btw, if that's important.

I'm a 27 year old Washington DC native currently living in Brooklyn, NY. Unfortunately, this weekend I helped my best friend move out of NYC and over the last few years I've helped just about everyone special to me move away. I like to be a good friend and be there for them when they need me but it sucks to not have anyone to hang out with anymore and it seems that we tend to drift apart as time goes on.

I'd love to meet someone new and fun, man or woman, gay or straight, on paths similar to mine and on ones different from me. I just want to meet good people and share some good conversation.

A little more about me: I'm a photographer, illustrator, musician, designer, graffiti artist, painter, etc and the only thing I love more than art is learning new things. I know lots of random things and do a lot of studying of new topics. My most recent project is starting a photography blog, it'll be a place to display my street and fashion photography.

I'm also vegan...mostly...but have a tendency to cheat every now and again. I'm not perfect and don't claim to be. It's okay if you're not vegan at all. I'm not very judgemental. I see people for who they are and try to accept them. I'm probably the sweetest guy you'll ever talk to but at the same time I'm also a New Yorker and can be snarky as hell.

If you think I sound somewhat cool and would like to chat with me feel free to toss me a message. I'll reply ASAP.

Thanks so much!

I'm still going to school to get my diploma for studying, but I have no idea what I want from life...
I have no hobbys except playing videogames, watching movies and reading from time to time. (mostly books about psychology and some novels)
But when I break out of my shell, I can be a nice person with a good sense of humor (hope so, lol..), and be almost a bit hyperactive.

I hope this doesn't sound too boring, I just want to be honest with writing about myself.
If you have any interest in Texting/Skyping with me or any other question, write a comment or drop me a message. Please.

Recently single and ready to mingle, and I figured r4r is another way for me to meet new people in addition to bars and parties.

**About me**

I don't know what to say, it's always hard to talk about yourself without listing things.  I am a student in NYC who will be applying to medical school this summer.  5'9, Asian, slim, stylish, funny, adjectives. I have 0 talent in music but I love good music and dancing.  I'd like to say I can twerk it, but if the music isn't right I can be stiff.  Sometimes, you just need to feel it to work it, yknow?  I enjoy learning choreography especially if I can channel my inner swag.  All I've been listening to is old RnB and rap, but I very much enjoy bands.  Most recent band to be added to my iPod was Band of Horses.  Listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar and A$AP Rocky.

I am also reading a lot more now.  Currently reading ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking and before that, I reread ""Siddartha"" by Herman Hesse.  It's hard to fit in leisure reading with my schedule.  

This is starting to sound like I'm filling out an application so I'll just give you a run down of a typical weekday.

*Wake up. (drank).

*Coffee. (Breakfast)

*Shadow doctor in ER / Class / Research in lab

*Lunch

*Catch up on readings

*Class

*Dota 2/Reddit

*Gym / Dance studio sometimes

*Work (Read books and study)


So that's me. I am just looking for friends to go shoot the shit, drink some whiskey, dirty dance with at the clubs, and just have fun.

But even more so, I love music and play lead guitar in a metal band. I don't want to put anymore here, because that'll take the fun out of getting to know me.

If you study any kind of science, have a love for intelligent discourse, or just really love music, then I want to hear from you!",22M,False,,t5_2vfcm,False,22M,,True,t3_17bw3o,http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/17bw3o/22musa_looking_for_people_to_talk_with/,

I wouldn't say that I like all genres , but I'm into many different types of music and always open to listen to new stuff.

1357529580.0,5,self.MakeNewFriendsHere,163ke6,27/M/Chicago - Trying to make some new friends (x-post r/r4r),medrolific,7,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/163ke6/27mchicago_trying_to_make_some_new_friends_xpost/,"I posted this about a month ago in this subreddit, but I received very few responses. So, I'm trying it again. (As stated in the title, I also posted this in r4r, but I figured I'd give it one more shot here.) Get ready, there's a lot of info about me coming below. 

-------------------

After years of not having many friends, I decided to give this a shot. I'd like to make some new friends. Ideally, I'm trying to find new people who would be interesting in hanging out, doing things, having conversations that extend beyond a few sentences, etc. If you're not in Chicago, just talking online is cool, too. 

I've been told that I'm ""shy,"" and I know that I'm introverted, but I don't *feel* that way. Personally, I think that I can be a little [zany](http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users9/dexy/default/big-pimpin-daddy--large-msg-113537718852-2.jpg), but maybe that's just me.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in English.

In college, I was an avid photographer, and I spent a lot of time in the dark room. Last year, [my photography was in an exhibition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dggEorHctA8&amp;feature=plcp). I haven't been doing much of that lately due to the cost and time commitment. I'll probably get back into it within the next few years. 

I wrote a screenplay a few years ago. I write every now and then for leisure, but I haven't come across a story idea that I want to develop into anything longer. I really enjoy collaborating with people on writing projects. So, if that's your thing, I'm definitely game for that.

I am [currently](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-b-C4BZpO1pI/UKHaSWKXueI/AAAAAAAAAjY/OxoSXSzNxok/s439/photo.jpg) in the second year of a nursing program. I plan to work in an ICU prior before moving on to graduate studies. Working in health care has always been my goal. 

I have been working with people who have developmental disabilities for about a year. 

I am a CPR/First Aid/AED instructor. I think I'm pretty good at it.

Some of my favorite authors include Truman Capote, Charles Bukowski, Vladimir Nabokov, and Kurt Vonnegut. 

My favorite movies are *[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove)* and *[What About Bob?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_About_Bob%3F)*

I used to have a [radio show](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zN3K5faGsVI/S4YFyLEu4hI/AAAAAAAAAAM/vIbGiblgmlg/w537-h644-p-k/2010.02.11.JPG) at the University of Chicago (WHPK 88.5 FM Chicago). During that time, I obviously listened to a lot of music. So, I could rattle off a list of artists/bands/genres that I like, but the ones that I really enjoy listening to the most are [Frank Zappa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa), [Captain Beefheart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Beefheart), [Tom Waits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits), most funk, and [free jazz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_jazz). 

My favorite television show has always been [Twin Peaks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks). Currently, I'm keeping up with Dexter, Homeland, Breaking Bad, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. 

Every now and then, I like to go out for a cocktail or some good beer. My favorite drinking locations include [The California Clipper](http://www.californiaclipper.com/), [The Map Room](http://maproom.com/), and [Delilah's](http://www.delilahschicago.com/).

Sometimes, I like to go out and sing karaoke and pretend that I'm an avant-garde Howlin' Wolf-esque reinterpreter of songs. [Especially when I'm on a cruise ship and accompanied by a live band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s9arCixF7Y). 

I also like to show up in [news segments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQLSBv93m5Q&amp;feature=plcp). (3:26) Here's [one more](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKozu0igPM&amp;feature=plcp). (2:48)

I think that should about do it for now.

Anyway, if you're in the Chicagoland area, that's great. If not, that's okay, too. Shoot me a message, and I'll shoot one back. Tell me what you think. Let's ask each other questions. Let's try to keep a conversation moving beyond two messages.

I'm hoping to make a few new friends, maybe some that I wouldn't mind chatting with on a more frequent basis (Skype).

So here's a few things about me::

~Books:: I'll read most anything. Except cheesy romance novels. . . ok, well, I'll read some smut. But I'm pretty picky. I love fantasy, thrillers, spy/noir, murder mysteries, even conspiracy and horror. I like the occasional ""odd book"" like The Fuck Up, The Perks of Being A Wallflower.

~I love Horror. I love to scare myself. I even love B-Rated for laughs(: I scare and startle really easy but that doesn't stop me. At all. I don't really have a favorite movie, serious or otherwise.

~I've found that I'm pretty nifty when it comes to making some pretty tasty treats. I love trying/baking new things and seeing what new thing I can come up with(:

~I love dogs. Especially big dogs. Something my size that will cuddle and love me to bits? YesPlease. Right now, I have a little dachsund name Angela. She's 9 and fat like a sausage almost, with a perpetual puppy face. She's super derpy but smart when she wants to be haha

~I love stuffed animals. Or just anything soft that I can cuddle and hold on to. It's a sort of safety blanket for me as well as just comfortable.

~I'm incredibly shy in person. I have a tendency to hide behind my hair or turn incredibly red when I first meet someone. I mumble somewhat but I'm getting better at that(: 

So tell me what you like, how was your day, or what you've been up to today(:

Edit:: I'm also a rainbow demon xD (look in comments)

Edit2:: Apparently I have to clarify that **NO**, I am **NOT** looking for a relationship. I am already in one. **NO**, I do **NOT** want to cyber. There are other subreddits for that and other people who I am very sure would love to make your day in those specific areas.

I don't have much preference for your gender, feel free to reply regardless of how you identify yourself. Let me tell you a bit about myself.



I'm a student in university studying physics. If you've got a similar inclination, hooray! I would love to talk science with all of you. My intention is to pursue a graduate degree in astrophysics after my undergrad. What are you studying? If you're passionate about a subject, tell me about it. I'm keen on learning about the interests of other students.

Miscellany:

* I quite like music. I've been playing the drums for 11 years now and I sometimes like to mess around on the piano, though I wouldn't dare claim any proficiency. I listen primarily to progressive rock, classical, instrumental music. Here are a couple examples of what I'm currently listening to! - [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYfQ1I-VV7M), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csBEUb_eNp8), and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtQ2-5wWP8). Let me know what you think!

* I enjoy reading. I generally read fantasy, sci fi, and nonfiction science. What types of books do you read? Perhaps we can read a book together and discuss our thoughts.

* I tend to prefer television shows to movies as I feel they allow more time for character/plot development. My list of favorites includes but is not limited to: Star Trek, Sherlock, Firefly, Breaking Bad, Flight of the Conchords, Archer. I also watch a fair amount of documentaries. Anything regarding space is sure to pique my interest. I also enjoy the occasional episode of 'How It's Made' or the like. I did say I prefer tv shows, but that doesn't mean I don't like movies. In fact, there are a few I'm quite fond of. A few of my favorite movies: Midnight in Paris, Romantics Anonymous, The Room, and I just recently watched Shall We Kiss. I must say, I really enjoyed that movie. This past weekend was a great movie weekend for me. I watched Silver Linings Playbook (beautiful movie, in my opinion) and Django Unchained. I enjoyed both in very different ways. I also watched To Rome with Love, which I wanted so badly to love. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed with that one. 

* This brings me to my next point. I'm learning to speak french. I'm not very far along, but I'm making great progress and I'm enjoying every bit. Because I've started learning this language, I've been watching French movies to get some extra practice in. If you're interested in learning with me, please let me know. I've been using [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com) and that's been working rather well.

* I'm not particularly athletic or knowledgeable in regards to professional sports. I've played many sports, but enjoyed few. The few I enjoy are tennis, disc golf, and racquetball. 

* My personality type is INTJ.

* I enjoy playing board games and video games when I can find time in my schedule. If you're interested in playing co-op, do let me know. I typically find myself playing Ghost Recon Future Soldier, but I've got many other games that I've picked up during various Steam sales. 

* Information you may or may not need: I'm an atheist, I've only broken two bones, and I have great difficulty sleeping on airplanes. 
 

What I'd like from you:

If you've made it to the end of this post (and enjoyed it) please post a description of yourself and your interests! Let's be friends.

I'm an **online college student with no time to venture out to meet people.** Not having a car sucks too. I have tried other subreddits, such as /r/textpals, and it is hard to find PLATONIC friends on them. That word needs to sound more intimidating. 

I am **mostly interested in making friends with a girl** because I currently have none. I have a boyfriend and I have some cool guy friends but the two don't mix very well. I don't have anyone to hang out with anymore. **If you are a guy and you are really interested in messaging me go ahead but please remember it is JUST FRIENDS** (reddit can be like a creepy dark alley for those who admit to having a vag.) Also, remember that **I want a TEXT friend, NOT AN IM friend, please.** I already spend 12 hours a day on the stupid computer. I can add you on facebook too.




**About Me:**

I love to text and talk on the phone. I like listening and helping with advice. I am not an extremely feminine/materialistic girl but I like shopping, painting my nails, attempting eye shadow, baking, and talking about boys, etc. I am super empathetic and I can be very supportive. 

I do like hiking, traveling, camping, and random drunken adventures. I have broken the law on occasion just for the bucket list. I like to party hard and I like to sit at home and do boring things. I love driving long distances. Hmm... and I like photography and looking at animals. Etc etc etcccccc.

My favorite movies are from Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill's) and Tim Burton (Big Fish). My favorite books are from Michael Crichton (Sphere or Eaters of the Dead). I don't watch TV, just movies. If I do bother to turn the teli on I try to find some crazy conspiracy aliens visiting Earth show or Netflix documentaries. My favorite music is from MGMT (Weekend Wars) and Pink Floyd (Wish You Were Here). I just got a 3DS and I am addicted to Animal Crossing. I have been addicted to Zelda, RCT, Xenosaga and Pokemon before.

I am in my last year of undergrad studying Microbiology. I just started volunteering at a marine science place and I do literature research for the boss as of the moment. No paying job, sadly. Nobody loves me enough to hire me. I am starting to think I look weird and they would be afraid of me scaring customers away :'(

I like going to the cinemas, shopping, doing sports (mountain biking, gym), going out for dinner/lunch and going to the clubs.
The reason why I am looking for girls to hook up with is, that I normally can get along better with them like boys. And I am not a person who is dick-driven …
I grew up in a ""well-to-do"" family. Idk if ""well-to-do"" is the right word.. in Germany we say ""gut situiert"" it means that i didn't grew up in an ""poor environment"". This means i know how to behave in good locations (clubs, restaurants etc.) and being a gentleman.
But this doesn't mean I am a boring person … People who know me better can confirm for 100% that I am NOT ^^

So if I have sparked your interest don't hesitate to get in contact with me!
I can also send you further informations if you ask for them.

I'm not sure what else to put here, really. I'd rather just talk to someone without them knowing my interests right off the bat. We're bound to find some things in common between us; either way, I believe that opposites attract in both atomic and platonic senses.

I like long walks, but not necessarily on the beach. Friends describe me as an honest, genuine person that's not overly two-faced. They also say that I have a wonderful voice, figuratively speaking, that shines through in my conversations on and offline. I'm pretty open-minded and receptive to what others say, so I like to think that I'm a generally nice guy.

But I'm ill so I thought I would try to make some new friends.

I'm generally really happy in life. There's no one I'd say no to getting to know either. I love scents, hence the lavender and bath bombs are so great too. 

I'm a recovered bulimic, woohoo. I'm quite sporty now and I like to keep active, I run quite a lot - mostly in aid of charity. I do a lot of work and fundraising for a local charity and the children that they support. So much that they found themselves in a position to pay me to do it, so that's my job. I absolutely love it.

I also do quite a lot of work with the school that I attended where healthy eating, eating disorders and body image issues are concerned, no one really picked up on it when I attended so I try to do talks and presentations whenever I can.

I have many interests: Cooking, going to the gym, running, reading (excessively. I want my house to be full of books), writing, tree climbing, rock climbing and recently I took up skateboarding for fundraising purposes - the local skaters find it hilarious that in three weeks I have to 'drop in' on a twenty seven foot ramp and I can't even stand straight.

In between all of that I do find time to enjoy a movie, I'm proud to say that me and my brother collectively own every disney DVD ever released to date (and on going). Also a massive fan of Dreamworks and How To Train Your Dragon is my favorite movie of all time.

Music - If you play it I will listen, and I will probably enjoy it. I'm very open and love all kinds of music and have a mood to suit every genre, I'm sure.

TV - Modern Family, The Office (U.S.), Arrested Development, It's always sunny in Philadelphia, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad. My guilty pleasure or one that I'm otherwise usually too embarrassed to admit is Desperate Housewives.

Food - ALL THE FOOD.

I enjoy all kinds of music really, right now I'm getting back into Daft Punk, and I listen more to hip-hop and such (not mainstream though ;) ) I love Community, Breaking Bad, Suits, The Walking Dead, and I still kind of like The Office, but not really. I don't game as much as I use to, but i've been playing CS:GO and a bit of league of legends here and there.

I also enjoy video games.

I've never really had many people I can call friends, even now I would say that I have a grand total of 3/4 people I would happily call friends and that would say the same about me, and that includes my fiancée, and also 1 or 2 people I met here on Reddit who have become good friends of mine.

I like anime and manga, gaming (mainly PC), web design, movies, stand-up comedy, just about anything that will make me laugh.

What I would really like is someone that I can play games with, I have a Steam account and an Xbox Live Gold membership (but not many 360 games, as I said, I'm mainly PC), but if you don't play games and we share some interests, then we can just chat about anything.

So if you want to chat I have Skype and MSN (I use Skype much more than MSN though), send me a PM here and we can chat and if you have either program we can talk on there as well.

There is obviously no limit on how far away you are, the closer you are the easier it is to talk at sociable hours and of course any age or gender :)
