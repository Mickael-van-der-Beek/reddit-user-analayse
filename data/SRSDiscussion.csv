**Why are minorities so annoyed all the time?**

When SRS rolls into town, it is a common occurrence that the discussion turns toward bigotry, the use of offensive racial language as well as stereotypes, and Caucasian-American privilege.  Often well-intentioned liberals and anti-racists have been game for a scuffle and have put forth some very excellent points.  I commend you.  You are a credit to all of our races.

However, I find myself occasionally scrunching my nose up at what I find to be one of the weakest arguments that arises.  The idea of the *echo* of a racist past.  The belief that racism has deleterious effects passed down through generations once those policies that were in place have been removed is a substantive point.  If one group was denied education, they are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to legacies and finances.  If one group was denied any representation, they have to work to move the Overton window until their very civil rights become acceptable.

Now, before I get too deep into it, I have to say that this is a very valid point and based off of the nature of civil realities as much as discourse.  And since it is so valid, it is often the easy point to make.  But there is one big problem.  It assumes that racism and racist policies just suddenly ended.  It implies that the system now works and it is simply groups trying to catch up that explains why they are so far behind.

 [AfAm educational attainment is about half that of C-Am and C-Am educational attainment is about half that of AsAm]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_outcomes_in_the_United_States_by_race_and_other_classifications#Education_Attainment).  [As for average salaries]( http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/HR%20Statistics/Salary%20by%20Sex%20and%20Race.htm), AfAms make 20% less than C-Ams who make 8% less than AsAms.  However, [the poverty rate]( http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p60-239.pdf) for AfAms is **3 times** that of C-Ams while AsAm poverty is currently **25% higher** than poverty rates for C-Ams (AsAm poverty is relatively steady, but C-Am poverty has been increasing toward it due to the recession, so as little as 5 years ago the difference was 50%).  If AsAms have twice as much schooling as C-Ams, why would they have higher rates of poverty?  The simple answer seems to be in legacies of inherited wealth, which minorities lack due to how recently they achieved access to educational opportunities. 

--&gt; That, of course, in no way explains why **college-educated Asian-Americans have unemployment rates [33% higher](http://www.epi.org/publication/snapshots_20090422/) than those of Caucasian-Americans** despite double the educational attainment levels.

So we hit a telling snag with the *echo of a racist past* point.  For example, AfAm salaries are 14% higher than non-white Hispanic/non-white Latino salaries and educational attainment is up to **50% higher** for AfAms but poverty levels for blacks are *slightly higher* than for Hispanics.

Something has to explain why education and salary are not good indicators of socioeconomic status for some groups compared to others.

**Why are black people so annoyed all the time?**

Since I'm black and have far more experience exploring these issues from a black perspective, that will be the point of view from which this effort post goes forth.  Now, let's start at the beginning.  And I don't mean with your typical [little kids are raised to be racist against blacks]( http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/17/ac360-series-doll-study-research/) meta-horror but with some systemic failures of the justice system.

First, children are generally not responsible for most of their stupid decisions.  And yet, we have a corrective system in place to handle juveniles who break the law.  [That juvenile system imprisons black youths at six times the rate as white youths](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_23_97/ai_62298420/) -- **for the same crimes, with no criminal record**.  More importantly, despite being only about 15% of the under-18 population, black youths are 40% of all youths tried as adults and 58% of all youths sent to adult prisons.  Black youths arrested for **the same violent crimes as whites** when comparing those with **no prior record** were **nine times as likely to be incarcerated.**  Nine.  Fucking.  Times.  **NINE HUNDRED PERCENT.**

Of course, if you're tried as an adult, your record isn't expunged and you can stay in prison past the age of 18.  This means a non-Hispanic white can commit just as many crimes as a black person and the black person will be treated like a career criminal and the white person may not even be sentenced to probation.

But let's keep going, shall we?

You see, we were assuming that this black juvenile actually committed a crime.  [Unfortunately, this is not always the case]( http://newsone.com/nation/associated-press/racism-is-a-major-factor-in-unjust-convictions/).  And unfortunately still, white people, who are the largest population in the United States, [are the worst at making cross-racial identifications, particularly when it comes to black people]( http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/3501656-1.html) -- black people have no noticeable disability with cross-racial identification toward any racial group.

But how was he even put into the system?  Could it be the [ridiculous number of stop-and-frisks]( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/opinion/police-stop-and-frisks.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss)?  The 400% arrest rate of blacks over whites in places like [California]( http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/Targeting_Blacks_for_Marijuana_06_29_10.pdf)?[The disproportionate sentencing once someone is found guilty of a drug crime]( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06disparities.html?adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1324587938-JA8OosWAi53x7QaNx/pGoA)?  That last part could be the reason more than half of all people imprisoned for drug possession are black.  It's not because black people do more drugs because they [engage in that activity at the same rate]( http://criminaljustice.ncbar.org/newsletters/criminaljusticefeb11/racialdisparities.aspx).  But seriously, [Daloy Polizei]( http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/03/02/decades-disparity-0).

Then again, what happens once that person is in prison?  Well, [blacks (and Hispanics) face harsher, longer sentences than non-Hispanic whites for the same crimes]( http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/sp/disparity.pdf).  And if the victim is white, the punishment is even harsher.  This is even more the case when it comes to the *death penalty.*  In fact, [the very crime of being black is enough to push your punishment into death penalty territory]( http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-penalty-black-and-white-who-lives-who-dies-who-decides#TheRawData).  Yes, I said *the crime of being black.*  There is as much predictive validity in being black for determining whether you get the death penalty as there is if you could have killed an innocent bystander.  Being black is nearly the equivalent of reckless endangerment for death penalty sentencing.

--------------

**But what does this have to do with black people being pissed off at white people?**

Well, I didn't actually say that, but let's get comfortable.  This gets really complicated.

[A study of 115 white male undergrads]( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207163811.htm) found that the *dehumanization* of blacks by whites made witnessing brutality against black people acceptable.  And we're not talking brainwashing, we're talking the priming of subtly held racist beliefs about the *inhumanity* of black people.  You see, when these undergrads were primed with images and words like ""ape"" and ""brute,"" they were no more likely to find the violence justifiable against the white suspect whether or not they were primed, but those who were primed by these words were more likely to consider violence against the black suspects justifiable.

And, no, I don't think that's why so many black people might be pissed off at white people.  I think it has more to do with the fact that [black people with college degrees have unemployment rates approaching the national average]( http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/07/28/african-american-middle-class-eroding-as-unemployment-rate-soars/).  Or that [**white felons** are more likely to find employment than black people with *equal qualifications* and **no criminal records.**](http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/09/study-black-man-and-white-felon-same-chances-for-hire/).  This probably helps explain why [unemployment among blacks is more than twice as high as the average for the country]( http://www.epi.org/publication/snapshots_20090422/).

Or maybe not.  Maybe, like all of the other minorities, black people are just tired of the [goddamn hate crimes]( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/tables/table-5-offenses-known-offenders-race-by-bias-motivation-2010.xls).  Especially the ones that are [unreported]( http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2005/winter/hate-crime).

Actually, it's a little unfair to be so broad about something that is actually quite rare.  Let's put a head on it.  The real reasons some black people might be pissed at white people is not how society treats them but that, despite all of this, white people tend to think that [*they* are the greatest victims of racial discrimination in this country]( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110523124220.htm), [46% don't think racism against blacks is widespread at all](http://www.gallup.com/poll/109258/Majority-Americans-Say-Racism-Against-Blacks-Widespread.aspx), and a full [63% of them]( http://www.gallup.com/video/108865/Perceived-Treatment-Minorities-Differs-Race.aspx) think that the way black people are treated is *completely cool*.

""But wait!  I voted for Obama!""  [No, fuck you.]( http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-obama-could-be-bad-for-racial.html)

But I don't believe that white people are racist.  I am reluctant to believe that most white people are racist.  Perhaps many of them simply don't know any better, which I, with some magnanimity will grant.  It's not like someone collected all of this into one place for them to peruse or anything.

Also, who are the fuckers in the overlap between ""racism is widespread"" and ""but whatever, black people are treated fine?""  Someone answer me that.**

&gt; [One more study you may want to add to your amazing effort post, OP](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/nyregion/13frisk.html).

&gt; &gt; Blacks and Latinos were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped by the police in New York City in 2009, but, once stopped, were no more likely to be arrested. 

You'd think once they got to two or three times as many stop-and-frisks without showing an increased likelihood of criminal activity they would stop.  Oh well, guess they ""fit the description.""

To be precise, between blacks and whites, the whites who were stopped were 40% more likely to be arrested than the blacks who were stopped **(1.1 for blacks versus 1.7 for whites)**.

**EDIT 2:** And thank you, steviemcfly for [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/o4qsa/effort_an_american_perspective_why_black_people/c3eil0z) bit about pervasive racist myths on scholarships.
&gt; In America, it's, ""Black people get scholarships, but white people have to pay for college!"" even though [minority scholarships account for a quarter of one percent of all scholarships](http://www.timwise.org/2011/03/a-bad-year-for-white-whine-college-scholarships-and-the-cult-of-caucasian-victimhood/), only 3.5% of people of color receive minority scholarships, and [scholarships overwhelmingly and disproportionately go to white people](http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/09/13/318153/scholarships-go-disproportionately-to-white-students/?mobile=nc).

(i.e., 0.25% of scholarships go exclusively to minorities while 76% of scholarships are given to whites)

**EDIT 3:** Lots more comments.  Some interesting, some counterpoints, and some absolutely nonsensical.  Still, I think there's merit in this.

1) **If you disagree with something, then cite a refutation/counterpoint.**  Just saying, ""I disagree with this and refuse to acknowledge it"" isn't discourse, it's whining because your feelings were hurt.  You know who does that?  Politicians.  **Do you want to be a politician?**  Do you want to cry because you don't like facts that disagree with you?  If you can't come up with an actual, substantive, cited reason why you disagree with something then chances are *your prejudices have just been challenged.*  There's hope!  Just breathe slowly.  Walk away from the computer.  Think about it.  Then come back and type, ""Wow, I never really gave it that much thought but I suppose you're right.  This explains so much about the world and has changed my view.""

2) **Don't even comment on something unless you take the time to read the source.**  It's why it's there.  If you don't think you can find a citation, it's because what you are reading is a follow-up to the previous citation *in the sentence before it.*

3) There are some very uncomfortable truths you are going to uncover if you *seriously* engage the material instead of pulling a 63-percenter and sticking your fingers in your ears.  *Ignoring facts does not make them go away.*

4) Anecdotal evidence has a margin of error +/- 100%.

&gt; The results of our study were straightforward and striking: *In cases with no blacks in the jury pool,* black defendants were convicted at an 81% rate and white defendants at a 66% rate. *When the jury pool included at least one black member,* conviction rates were almost identical: 71% for black defendants and 73% for whites. **The impact of the inclusion of even a small number of blacks in the jury pool is especially remarkable given that this did not, of course, guarantee black representation on the seated jury.**

**BULLSHIT:** ""That's all well and good, but the real problem is [insert paraphrased anecdote from your angry, racist uncle.]""  In fact, if your angry, racist uncle would say it, you should probably avoid it altogether -- *no matter how clever it sounded at the time*.

**CONSTRUCTIVE:** ""Your points may be valid and well-sourced, but this study shows that [insert citation and statement here]...""  That's good because then other people can refute you and then you can volley back and then some semblance of the truth can be achieved.

**TL;DR:  How can sex work (pornography, prostitution, stripping) be considered positive and empowering when it so often contributes to the objectification and marginalization of those it employs?**

Take this quote from [Derailing for Dummies](http://derailingfordummies.com/complete.html#disbelief) as an example of an argument I typically see:

&gt;   if a sex worker is making the claim that sex work can be a positive and empowering choice or the issue isn‘t the work but the stigma levelled at it, you absolutely must say they are obviously a very Privileged® sex worker because “real” sex workers are always degraded, hate their jobs and are forced into it.

This strikes me as, well, a little problematic.  I get that the stigma is in large part the issue (that because a person *does* a certain thing for work that they *are* a certain thing which is obviously not true), but to me it seems as if this industry (stripping, prostitution, pornography) is largely defined by marginalization and dehumanization.

Also, relevant to a related conversation I had on this very forum recently, there is the notion that becoming a porn star, for instance, could be considered ""empowering.""  The issue was never really resolved, but, to give you a sense of where it wound up, we ultimately were left more or less debating the merits of indentured servitude versus slavery.  My argument was that embracing the demands of your oppressors and internalizing them, perhaps even to the point (as in the case of Jenna Jameson) that you become an advocate in favor of others doing the same hurts yourself and others in a *real* sense (by perpetuating and, in the eyes of many, providing a rationalization for your oppression) even if it serves to improve your personal immediate circumstances.  This appears complacent to me, and complacency, to my mind, isn't synonymous with empowerment.

I don't want to be mistaken for *blaming* such persons for their situation or choices, and I don't mean to imply that a person can never simply choose sex work for themselves and be fine with it or enjoy it the same as anyone else enjoys any other job.  But at the same time, isn't it true that these industries by in large *are* degrading and (in the case of straight porn, at least) tailored to serve the male gaze and diminish women to sex objects?  

The vast majority of pornography I see seems to be almost if not entirely about the *abuse* of women.  I would not hold it against someone for trying to make a living in that industry, but are they really *empowered* by contributing to it?  The best answer I've heard in response to this is that it may be empowering for them even if it contributes to the broader oppression of women, but, seeing as they are also women, how can something be simultaneously empowering *and* oppressive?",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_10uki1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/10uki1/hang_ups_about_sex_work/,

A lot of people who love and respect women don't have much luck with them either, (Contrarily, it's a silly argument, because a lot of misogynists get laid CONSTANTLY.  There's a misogynist having sex somewhere right now, as you read this.) and this reverse-slut-shaming really does no one any favors.  

Consider this: SRS undoubtedly has supporters, male and female, who ""can't get laid"".  Maybe they have psychological issues, (Hello PTSD) maybe they're still unsure of their sexuality/gender, or they're celibate/asexual, or they're just plain physically unattractive in the conventional sense.  They don't want to speak up when someone on SRS goes on a tirade about some misogynist with a few choice jabs at his supposed inability to seduce women because hey, don't break up the circle jerk.

1338690578.0,267,self.SRSDiscussion,ui1jt,[TW] Do any of you remember a woman under the name 'theoculus' who was accused of faking a sexual assault claim last September? I am she.,troubladour,311,44,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/ui1jt/tw_do_any_of_you_remember_a_woman_under_the_name/,"Greetings and salutations.

For those unfamiliar with this story, I will lay it out for you. In September of 2010, I was beaten and sexually assaulted on the streets of Toronto. I posted a topic to r/reddit.com with a picture of my messed up face trying to raise awareness about rape culture. Soon after, a user posted a link to a previo us post of mine wherein I had a fake wound for a Zombie walk, using this to disprove my story. Loads of users then rallied to scour my post history drudging up any information that would prove I was a liar.

For more detailed accounts of this situation, please refer to [these effortposts](http://www.reddit.com/r/littletigereffort/comments/r73r5/effortpost_once_upon_a_rape_culture_a_classical/) or [this Jezebel article.](http://jezebel.com/5839306/reddit-users-hit-a-new-low)

The situation then ended with me having to post a video of myself wiping my face with a wet facecloth to prove my wounds weren't faked. 

I was partially vindicated I guess, and then the subject was dropped. But not everybody dropped it. While the majority of reddit stopped talking about it, I was receiving death threats. At first it was just through reddit, I contacted admins and such, and they were mostly helpful but more accounts just kept popping up to toss me some shit. Then I started receiving threats and jeers to my facebook, to my e-mail, and even my cell phone. I had to change numbers, lock up all my internet shit, and move. It was horrendous.

Above all, I was so angry. I was furious. I wanted so desperately to come back and bring light to this situation. The problem was, now, I was afraid to. I could come back, talk about how fucking unacceptable it was that I was assaulted, talk about how being injured as such caused me to be a semester behind in school, how I'm STILL going through emotional therapy and physical therapy, and how I endured all this with receiving daily death threats from some fuckheads who still believed I was lying. 

What would talking about this whole fiasco accomplish? I would be labeled an 'attention whore' once again for bringing up the subject. Beyond death threats and general mockery, I received pleading messages from moderaters asking me to let the subject die. I logged in to find all my submissions deleted. I deleted my account for good, and moved on.

But now, I am ready to talk about it. I need to talk about it. There are so many people who don't believe misogyny is an issue on reddit, that everyone here are just hyper sensitive PC Nazis. As a victim of these attacks, I feel it prudent to discuss it fully and clear up any speculations.

I work at a hostel while I'm travelling abroad so I encounter a lot of people getting drunk/hooking up, etc.  Tonight there was one couple and they seemed to be getting on well, but at one point the guy just invited the girl up to his room and she said ""no"".  He continued asking until she started to relent a bit and at this point he basically lifted her up on her feet and started guiding her to his room, but you could just tell she wasn't doing it fullly willingly and was dragging her feet.

When I got back to where the event happened, the guy and 3 other people around me said I ""cockblocked"" him and that she was obviously into it.  

Two of these people were my coworkers and I'm not sure I really know how to look at them anymore and not feel kinda disgusted, that not only were they willing to let someone be raped, but then defended the assailant.

Why of all the things you could have said about MLK and the American Civil Rights Movement you chose *that*?

2. It's not about free speech. It's about not being a dick. Is there any reason you need to use the same lame, rehashed jokes over and over, that are racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic?

This is a website on which you will in all seriousness receive more sympathy and calls for [""communication and understanding""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ojyjf/i_snooped_hes_been_looking_at_child_porn_what/c3hvdku) [+61] than if you're fat, a woman, or, the worst crime imaginable, a fat woman.

6. I don't know if it's the internet or Reddit but people on this website are *mean*. When I spend time with friends IRL they have flaws but they're basically nice people. I go on here and people are *nasty*. I don't want to be a part of that anymore.

7. Your treatment of women is appalling. It is impossible for a woman to post a picture without you either making sexual remarks, or ""ironically"" noting that ""oh, it's a woman"". FUCK OFF THANKS. Nothing more to say on this one.

8. Your treatment of people with any kind of partners is imbecilic. ""Hey, look x has a girlfriend!"" is not a good response. You do realise that normal, healthy people in relationships do *stuff* together (stuff that isn't you being on reddit while your partner weeps for being so terribly alone, I mean) and that stuff is sometimes worth of reddit! Shocking, I know.

9. But hey, that's not all redditors! See here. I study history. In history, we often have to infer what people believe from not necessarily very much. But in reddit, we have a very good metric for seeing what people think: upvotes! So what if it's 1000 upvotes out of a community of 300,000? When you see a poll do you assume it's bullshit because they've not asked everyone in the entire country the question? Reddit has a *very* strong basis on which we can say that there seem to be very prevalent attitudes. And dear God there are some so very fucked up attitudes on here.

Okay think that's pretty much everything. Thanks to SRS for making my last few months in this shithole halfway bearable. Tata folks!

1374220001.0,245,self.SRSDiscussion,1imazl,Tired of the Racism on Reddit?,black_in_america,283,38,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1imazl/tired_of_the_racism_on_reddit/,"I don't know how active this subreddit is, but I guess I am writing this mostly for my own solidarity.

I've been a Redditor for about a couple of years now and these past few days, since the Zimmerman verdict, have been eerily filled with racism on Reddit or maybe I've just had my filters and blinders on too long. Most likely a equal parts of both. 

What hurts the most is that I remember arriving to this country at the age of five. It was also the Fourth of July when my family landed in the airport, so my first impression of America was fireworks blasting in the sky. As a kid, you can understand how impressionable a first impression like that must be. This is the land of the free, the stars explode and rain down on you at night to let you know you are safe.

Growing up in America has allowed for many great opportunities in terms of university studies and furthering education. But it comes at a cost to some people, some more than others. As a Hispanic, who identifies as Black because of my nearer to ebony than ivory complexion, my kinky hair, and because there is never a moment in which I am not reminded of what my place in the stratum of society is, I have been subjected to the American experience of Being (with a capital 'B') Black in America. I've been unlawfully detained by police, unlawfully searched, not allowed to eat at a restaurant because I had a white girlfriend, received racial slurs from said girlfriend's family, see and understand fear and/or disgust in people's eyes when they feel my existing near them makes them uncomfortable, heard countless amounts of 'nigger's and 'spic's thrown my way. I never let it weigh me down, however abhorrent these things are, I manage to retell the stories to friends in lighthearted tones with a smile and a can-you-believe-that-happened attitude. 

But something about these past few days has put me in a slump, perhaps my filters and blinders have been wearing out, perhaps it's about time that I stopped turning a blind-eye to these injustices and see them for what they are. I tend to be very dismissive of things. But not anymore. I will not allow another tongue-in-cheek racist remark or joke slip out of somebody without informing them about their bigoted views. I will not allow another woman-kitchen joke be uttered without informing the person they are sexist. I will also fight for my LGBT brothers, sisters, and any identifier that does not fall within the master's gender dichotomy.

I used to not understand why activists can come off as angry. I'm never an angry person and I've dealt with many horrible things just due to the fact that I left my house. Just because I went outside. ""Can you believe that?"" But if you are angry because of any injustice, you are well within your person rights to be angry at this oppressive society. I will no longer feed these oppressive institutions by turning a blind eye, that is what this system thrives on, it perpetuates the proliferation of hate and bigotry when we decide to be silent. I will not be silent.

Many on Reddit can claim and upvote that Black people need to get over playing the race card if we want to progress our race relations. That we are the bigger racists. That we get benefits when we check in a box that we are black. We get facilitated acceptance into a university if we check in a box that we are black. We get accepted into a job if we check in a box that we are black. I want these people to know that to know this: You don't check a box to walk outside your house.

Where does a person of color look for inspiration in the history of this nation? It cannot be with the founding fathers, they were the ones who set this system into motion, they were the oppressors themselves. How can a person of color feel at home in a nation that does not acknowledge them if not as a bull's-eye for tossing their darts of hate? I don't know. But you know what? I still am American, no matter what any bigot out there who plays into the institution of ""White"" dominance may say. 

Take America Back? Take America Back? How do you feel marching to that tune? Especially when America was built on the blood, sweat, and tears — but mostly blood — of enslaved Africans and the eradication of Natives. America was the rape of aborigines, its infrastructure built by blacks. And you want to take America back from whom? To what?

I leave you with a poem from Langston Hughes and would like to remind you that your American experience is not the same American experience of others. Check your privileges at the door, take a number, sit down.

I, too, sing America.

I am the darker brother.  
They send me to eat in the kitchen  
When company comes,  
But I laugh,  
And eat well,  
And grow strong.  

Tomorrow,  
I'll be at the table  
When company comes.  
Nobody'll dare  
Say to me,  
""Eat in the kitchen,""  
Then.  

Besides,   
They'll see how beautiful I am  
And be ashamed—  

I, too, am America.  ",,False,,t5_2t5sa,1374268543.0,,,True,t3_1imazl,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1imazl/tired_of_the_racism_on_reddit/,
1328442912.0,250,self.SRSDiscussion,pbrg0,"Why Your Racist Joke Costs Me Money
",successfulblackwoman,328,78,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pbrg0/why_your_racist_joke_costs_me_money/,"This is largely an opinionated [rant](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ZgEA3jBblIE/SeNtTHN4EKI/AAAAAAAAAUA/s3Y7_hWYpic/s400/rant_small.jpg).  I shall endeavor to explain why your [""totally funny](http://images.mylot.com/userImages/images/postphotos/2462581.jpg) racist joke"" is actually causing me real, honest to goodness harm.  And not just me, but everyone that the joke could be about.

Bit of background.  At my job, I do almost all of the [hiring interviews.](http://0.tqn.com/d/jobsearch/1/0/P/O/behavioralinterview2.jpg)  During the hiring season this takes about 50% of my time.  The other 50% of the time I write code.  My job is to, in a very short period of time, evaluate a candidate, and figure out if he or she (probably he) is a good cultural fit for whatever [web development team](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/20/rails_logo_heart.png) we're assembling, is competent, and should be hired.  We're encouraged to [no-hire](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html) over hire, to be picky as hell, and to always tell someone ""no"" if anyone dislikes them.

So, this is a great opportunity for me to be racist.  Yes, [racist](http://www.forgetthebox.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/racist.jpg).  I might be a [minority](http://cdn.thefreshxpress.com/freshxp/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/educated-black-woman1-300x260.jpg), but behind that hiring desk I've got both power and prejudice.

This observation started after binging on [youarenotsosmart.com](http://youarenotsosmart.com).  I began to introspect on how often I make decisions on [bad](http://api.ning.com/files/DXH8raKkb7NWenALnGHEEMcRDczjhvmnLovDYdC1NRMkGCwNH1yiRbKqoVFirWqGZdNTu7cY726IzTBJbiLF1BvoV6Af-cPv/BadData.jpg) or superficial data.

While testing myself I've viewed hundreds of pictures with colleges and voted ""would hire / would not hire"" based on the photo and nothing more.  This has taught me some uncomfortable facts.  If you walk in with [baggy pants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMwhl4IrPNc&amp;t=33s), I'm going to dislike you.  If you're too tall or too short, I'll like you less too.  Now, I'm not justifying these opinions, but I am acutely aware of them.

There's no hiring manager in the world that has these subtle biases about subjective evaluation.  And thus anyone can lose a job interview just because of bad luck or, if the opinion becomes widespread, systemic bias.  You [think its your skill](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/07/the-just-world-fallacy/) that brings you success, but no, environmental conditions matter way more than you think.

So what does my bias have to do with your joke?  Mostly because people are [really bad at determining their own motives](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/05/26/the-perils-of-introspection/) and are vulnerable to manipulation from all sorts of directions.  Racism, even in a joke form, works as a very effective form of [priming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1OVhlRpwJc).  All it takes is a few bad stereotypes to form the kind of subconscious thought into that will actually affect their judgement.  So when you tell a joke about, say, asian people being [horrible drivers](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1hFDIyrM3EY/TLtycb1i76I/AAAAAAAAAPg/8RB1dyguAhI/s1600/thailand-car-crash-thumb.jpg), and I absorb that joke, then the next time I have to evaluate who is qualified to work offsite with rental cars on the company dime, I may very well subconsciously assume the [white guy](http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/demotivational-posters-tolkien-white-guy.jpg) is the better driver even though I have no evidence to support this.

You do it too.  And the [hivemind](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/02/10/deindividuation/) is making you more racist every day.

Now you can try to combat subconscious bias with conscious thought, but outthinking these patterns are hard.  Extremely hard!  It's like we're wired to find people [not like us](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/08/21/the-illusion-of-asymmetric-insight/) and assign negative qualities to them.

Now for me, I can usually outthink shit about my own race and gender, because I have myself to anchor on, but after cracking a bunch of jokes about Indian telemarketers take a guess who I don't want calling the customers?  That's right, our indian guy.  Now for the record, I noticed this behavior and corrected it, and he's one of our most eloquent speakers.  Still, how much behavior do I not notice every day?  How many times has hearing a racist joke cost the most qualified candidate his job?

So here you are going ""Herp Derp, what's the difference between a [black guy and a pizza](http://lowhangingbadapples.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/herman-cain-large-pizza.jpg?w=390&amp;h=300)?""  Ok, [very funny.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwg6ezepWy1qzjix8.gif)  Except that every time someone hears that racist ass joke, they might actually to subconsciously assign it some measure of truth, and once they assign it some measure of truth, it's going to affect their decision making.  Even if they're not consciously racist.

Even more importantly, thanks to [confirmation bias](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/) and the [backfire effect](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/) if a person has even a trace of racist thought, you can be sure exposure to racist jokes and the subsequent ""but X aren't really like that"" will both amplify the effect.

You might think yourself immune, but consider how many proverbs and [meaningless aphorisms](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/14/hindsight-bias/) you absorb as truth every day.

Subconscious, split second decisions about which fare a taxi driver should take, about [which car a cop should pull over](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_While_Black), about which defendant is guilty, about who to hire, who to promote, who should get a raise, who should be let go, who to date -- all of these things affect people, all the time.  You might think you're being rational and logical, but more often than not you make decisions and [justify them afterwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias).  And you, like me, are making these subconscious decisions with all those racist biases you've had instilled.

So when you tell a [racist joke](http://www.jokesprank.com/images/inoffensive.gif) and you don't consciously reject it, you're making my life a little bit worse.  When you tell it to your [non-racist](http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-graphs-what-is-said-after-saying-im-not-racist-but.png) friends, you're making my life a little bit worse too.

The effect is magnified on minorities.  Jokes about upper class black females don't really stick with me, but how many black female hiring managers are there, especially for well paying jobs?  I've met like, [two](http://i.kapook.com/glitter/2010/th/09/T240910_10C.gif), in my life.  More broadly, a joke about a minority will be spread further and faster, accepted more easily, and have greater impact than a joke about a majority.  That's why racist jokes about minorities, even if they're equally offensive, are worse.

Thus, I might have a [hard time getting a raise](http://newsone.com/files/2011/07/WEALTH-GAP.jpg) because you're telling jokes about black people.  That's my lifetime salary you're diminishing there.  And I'm posting not just for me, because [I'm doing ok](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3354/3239475698_54c011e8e1.jpg), but for everyone you tell a racist joke about.

But I think it's pretty obvious now that the link on Gawker wasn't ""doxxing.""  It was a fair profile, it talked to the subject of the profile beforehand, it was honest and forthright.

That's not doxxing, it's goddamn journalism.  It's watchdog journalism, investigation.  It's talking to sources and crafting a narrative.

Reddit treated it the same as if Adrian Chen had shown up and just posted VA's home address and phone number and a sign marked ""Pedophile"" next to it.

But those aren't the same thing.

Look, here's the deal.  I've been doxxed before, by an angry ex-boyfriend using a keylogger and then spreading vicious lies mixed with just enough truth to keep people believing.  It was horrible.  It was among the worst things that ever happened to me.  He sent messages to my family pretending to be me, he gave people my address who should never have had it.

And this isn't the same as that.  It's just not.  I've also been a journalist.  Public figures -- people who have MADE THEMSELVES PUBLIC FIGURES THROUGH THEIR ACTIONS -- aren't being ""doxxed"" when someone who knows their name reveals it.

I guess I don't see what's wrong with this or why we have to pretend to be against it.  This wasn't doxxing.  Don't cede ground to these assholes.  Adrian Chen isn't in the wrong and this is actually a point worth fighting over.

Do you really think Reddit should be a place where, so long as you break no laws, no matter how public a figure you become, everyone should work in concert to keep your identity a mystery?  People played VA's identity-secret game for a long, long time.  He took risks constantly.  It caught up to him, as it often does with public figures and the paparazzi.

Way too many of y'all are either saying, upvoting, or not reporting cissexist or transphobic stuff. We need to do better.  This stuff needs to stop, and I need y'alls help to make this happen.

Okay, lets start with the most recent example, that was over in SRSGaming.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/9AThm.png) comment was up *way* too long before it was reported, and it was *upvoted*. 

Now, I don't [particularly care](http://www.socialjusticeleague.net/2011/09/how-to-be-a-fan-of-problematic-things/) if the original game designers handled the character poorly, that's not an excuse for SRSers to say stuff like ""transgender male"" in this context. If someone says ""transgender male"", they generally should be talking about a trans guy (a dude who was assigned female at birth). 

Which brings us to the concept of ""biologically male/female"". Please read this article, *""[Bilaterally Gynandromorphic Chickens, and Why I’m Not “Scientifically” Male](http://skepchick.org/2011/12/bilaterally-gynandromorphic-chickens-and-why-im-not-scientifically-male/)""* if you haven't done so. I'll wait. 

While we're on that subject, please try to be more mindful about saying shit that assumes that someone with a penis = man, someone with a vagina = woman. Its not cool, particularly in the fempire.  This isn't third grade health class, I think we can move beyond assumptions about any particular body part (particularly genitals) equaling a specific sex or gender.

few other points:

- Trying to differentiate between trans* and cis people based on ""socialisation"" is usually going to be inaccurate and harmful.

- Chromosomes are not an accurate judge of anything and saying you have such and such a karotype is silly unless you have had them tested.

- if you are cis, you do *not* get to say ""die cis scum"". DCS is not your term to use, don't appropriate that shit, yo. While we're at it, ""cis scum"" is not shorthand for SAWCSM, ffs.

- Folks, I really shouldn't have to say this, but for the love of ~~gaga~~ tamera, using slurs is *not okay*, even ""ironically"". You know that one slur that starts with T and ends with Y? Yeah, don't fucking say that shit, please. just... don't do it.

JaronK provided this explanation, for anyone who was thinking of asking:

&gt;In case anyone was wondering, here's the answer: because all our history classes are taught primarily as white history. Our version of World History is pretty much just European History with a slight touch of South America and maybe China or a touch of the Middle East. But mostly, it's just European, to the point where folks actually believe that all major cultures started in Europe. And our version of US History is all white history too... mostly presidents and battles, with a touch of MLK thrown in.

&gt;So the reason we don't have a White History month is because there's already eleven of them... we just don't say it quite so explicitly.

&gt;The reason we have Black History month is to try and fill in just a little of the massive gaping hole in the history we teach. Should we need it? Absolutely not. George Washington Carver should be taught along with Thomas Edison. The Tuskegee Airmen should be taught along with Patton's tanks. Timbuktu should be taught along with Athens.

""Checking one's privilege"" is the act of honestly and comprehensively self-evaluating one's motives and perspectives as a person of privilege on some axis. It is not simply telling everyone what your race/gender/sexuality/other statuses are before you begin a discussion about a race/gender/sexuality/other issue. It is actually something you should do on your own, before you even enter into those discussions, that involves saying to yourself, e.g.: ""Is there something I'm missing here because of my relative privilege in this sphere? Is there more research I should do before I try to have a conversation like this as a person of privilege? Is my privilege allowing me to engage in this conversation in a way that others are unable to? Am I putting people who lack this privilege in an uncomfortable position in the conversation?""

I am concerned by the fact that some people here seem to believe that ""checking one's privilege"" is the mere acknowledgment that one is white, or a man, or cis, or whatever. Actually, posting about, for instance, a race issue and adding the ""disclaimer"" that you're white is quite the opposite of checking your privilege: it's asking other people to check it for you. I read it as shorthand for ""I'm white, so if I mess up, that's why, and I'd like to be corrected."" Don't get me wrong - I think it's important to be forthcoming about one's privilege in these conversations, and to acknowledge the shortcomings in understanding that might result, but acknowledging the *fact* of one's privilege is not the same thing.

At that point, it's basically just a more social justicey version of walking into a conversation about sexism and saying ""Well, as a man, here's what I think...""

Again, I don't mean to call anyone out and I don't think badly of people who do this, regardless of how hostile this post may sound (the tone is a reaction to a pet peeve, not a social justice grievance). It might ultimately just be an insidious mutation of vocabulary that has taken hold in this space (and perhaps others).

As others do, I find it to be problematic that whenever there's any talk of mass shooting, mental illness is a quick topic to come up. However, in examining the races of the killers, it appears that mental illness is a hot topic . . . only when the shooter is white. Below is a list of high profile mass shootings in the past decade (post-Columbine) in the U.S. If I forgot any, let me know.

The first number is the google search for the exact search phrase on the left. The second number is that search phrase with the word ""mental"" attached. One shouldn't try to go by percentage comparisons, as there are way too many variables to make any meaningful inferences from it. I included the first number though for a frame of reference, as the searches reveal widely varying numbers. 

Some of the names have the word ""shooter"" attached or a middle name removed. This was done to get the most accurate listings possible. For example, James Holmes, without the word ""shooter,"" has over 100 million results as there are other famous people with the name. You can mess around as well and see what you come up with. However, the findings from my search:

Adam Lanza shooter (W) -  2,940,000 / 2,170,000 

James Holmes shooter (W)  - 2,150,000 /  1,910,000

Wage Page shooter (W)  4,630,000 / 1,840,000

Jared Loughner (W) -  2,250,000 / 615,000

Michael McLendon (W)  1,580,000 / 1,630,000

Malik Hasan - (NW) 8,000,000 / 1,310,000

Seung-hui Cho (NW) 959,000 / 243,000


Hasan (not white) and Cho are the only non-white people, and they both rank in the bottom three for number of searches with the word ""mental."" Hasan would be in second place were it not for Jared Lougher, a lesser-known shooter.


Because so few non-white men have committed mass shootings in the past decade in the U.S., there aren't that many data points to go on. But this search indicates that mental illness is a hot topic . . . only when the shooter is white.

I have to admit, I'm getting kind of sick of some (obviously not all, but enough that I've noticed it) of the ""Hey, don't be so mean towards Christianity!"" or ""I don't know why people assume there's some correlation between Christianity and homophobia."" 
I don't know if it's some circlejerky response to r/atheism where we want to be pro-Christian. I mean, I get it. r/atheism is pretty immature. Nobody is doubting that. Well besides them, maybe. But let's be honest, Christianity is, and will always be, the tool and guidebook of the oppressor. Religion is the ultimate grooming tool. Christianity isn't ""used"" by homophobes. It was created by homophobes. They put that stuff in to make sure that homophobia stayed alive and well. 

""Oh no, The Bible is just so vague that it can be used to mean anything! These bigots are just making stuff up!""
Bullshit. When it comes to alternative sexualities, The Bible is very clear. Shall we go over what The Bible says about us?

Leviticus 20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

So in basic terms, if a dude fucks a dude, kill them both. The favorite book for anti-gay marriage opponents to quote. More? Alright.

Deuteronomy 22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

Deuteronomy 23:18 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

Remember this. The Bible puts ""whores"" and homosexuals in the same group. This will come up later. Oh yeah, The Biblical term for homosexual is ""dog."" Nothing bigoted about that, right?

Samuel 20:30-20:33. Some backstory here, Saul is pissed off that his son is having a gay affair. 

Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness? For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done? And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

Stab. Your. Gay. Son. Gotcha.

Kings 14:24 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

Kings 15:11 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father. 
Kings 15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 

Make  God happy, remove abominations (homosexuals) from your land.

Kings 2 23 23:7 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.

Josiah pleases God by burning down houses of homosexuals. 

Isiah 3:9  They declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul!
Isiah 3:10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
Isiah 3:11 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him. 

Homosexuals hide it not in Sodom! Woe unto them!

Daniel 11:37 Neither shall he regardthe God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.

This seems kinda harmless, until you realize that they are talking about the Antichrist. According to The Bible, homosexuality is literally Satanic. 

Romans 1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
Romans 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 

Romans 1:28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 

Romans 1:31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful. 

Romans  1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. 

Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.

GSMs are absolutely dispised by The Bible. And the effects are clear on society. There's a lot you have to ignore if you want to say that Religion hasn't fostered a culture of hatred. Name a single anti-gay law that didn't get major funding from a Christian group. Find a common thread with all of the major anti-gay politicians. Admit the correlation between The Bible Belt and hate speech/crimes. Think of the last time gay marriage was opposed by somebody who didn't bring up some garbage about Adam and Steve. Think about all of the GSM kids across the world getting bullied by kids who say they are going to Hell. Think of the anti-bullying laws that says it's OK to bully [gay youths](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/01/tn_bill_would_give_anti-bullying_laws_a_religious.php) to suicide as long as your religion says it's OK. Think of the hate crime victims who were told that they are going to Hell before they died. Think of the wildly succesful megachurches which remind it's followers that homosexuality is a sin. The most popular Christian TV show in the country is vehemently anti-gay. There are billboards across America preaching hatred against gays in the name of [God.]  (http://www.thegavoice.com/images/stories/10-29-10/billboard-body-11-2-10.jpg)

Remember that part of The Bible where it equates homosexuals with whores? [This is why I mentioned it.](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/17/us/texas-judge-eases-sentence-for-killer-of-2-homosexuals.html)

Gee, I wonder where he got that idea?

Do you honestly want to defend that just because it might piss off a bunch of teenagers who just read Nietzsche for the first time? 

I'm sure some Christians will read this and complain that I'm reminding them of the bigoted roots and effects of what they call their religion. Check your privilege. I don't have any interest in coddling people who fully embrace the culture of my oppressors. It's your religion, you deal with the culture it spawned. I know I have to.

**I'm Privileged, Now What Do I Do?**

*Privilege isn't your fault ~ Stompy Privilege Boots ~ Privilege Blinders ~ Use Your Powers for Good, Not Evil*

Recap on privilege:

&gt; (social) privilege is a set of **advantages**, given to members of a **power majority**, due to unbalanced and unfair **power structures** in a given society.

##Privilege isn't your fault.

Even if it sounds like an insult, it really isn't. And honestly? If someone *is* using ""privilege"" as a straight-up insult on its own, they probably don't fully grasp what privilege is.

Individuals are never born asking for privilege, and nearly everyone will have some form of privilege along some set of axis: racial, gender, sexuality, class, disability and so on.

But! The point about privilege is that it gives the privileged two things: great big stompy privilege boots, that can shut down the voices of the less privileged, and privilege blinders, which means that the privileged never have to see or experience what life's like for the unprivileged.

It's these two things - the boots and the blinders - that combine to make privilege harmful. But it is perfectly possible to participate in any cause even if you are a member of the majority. Remember to be aware of those boots and those blinders!

##Stompy Privilege Boots

Imagine having a crappy day - for whatever reason, nothing quite goes right. You've run out of milk, the coffee machine's broken, there's a traffic jam, the internet mysteriously refuses to work (but works for everyone else) - whatever. A million little things have happened that add up to make it a terrible day. 

Naturally you might want to vent to someone or at least try to fix some of the little problems - but imagine that every time you try, you get shut down with, ""But that's no big deal!"" or ""Why are you fussing?"" and *no one will listen*.

Extend the day to every day of your life, extend the little things to rather *big* things like housing and education and job issues, and imagine that those voices are not only loud and annoying, but *everywhere*. That is the effect of the Stompy Privilege Boots.

The Stompy Privilege Boots shut down conversation, trivialising issues and derailing conversations. The thing is, the privileged aren't always aware that they're stepping on someone's toes, and they don't always mean to be rude or what-have-you. But having the boots *on* makes it hard not to step on people's toes.

The metaphorical boots are metaphorically welded to your metaphorical feet. It's not something you can take off at will. However, being aware of your privilege boots can help. By being aware of the stompyness of the boots, you can make sure you're not stepping all over the marginalised and stopping them from speaking. By learning about the ways these boots shut out their voices, and the impact of this silencing, you can help combat not only the effects of privilege, but can help by showing *other* boot-wearers what not to do.

##Privilege Blinders

The boots also come with a complimentary set of blinders, by which I mean that privilege not only pushes others out of the way, it means that the privileged don't ever have to realise what they're doing.

The privilege blinders are what lead to well-intentioned but ultimately hurtful statements like, ""If someone called me pretty on the street it'd make my day! [with regards to catcalling]"" or ""Hey, aren't positive stereotypes okay?"". They also lead to the phenomenon of majoritysplaining: ""As a straight ally, I think pride parades are too intimidating, here's how they should be run..."" ""As a man, this is how feminism should work..."" ""As a cis ally, the trans\* community are scaring away potential allies, here's what they should be doing instead...""

You are well within your rights to suggest potential improvements, true, but remember the boots? The privilege blinders make the boots occasionally hard to see. And so things like telling the marginalised how to run their movement is a clear case of stomping - but it doesn't seem that way. It just sounds like good solid advice. Except... I guarantee you the movement has heard it before. Heck, they've probably tried it before, many many times, and it's not working or it simply costs far too much to keep doing. So it leads to resentment and lashing out and everyone getting upset.

It is hard to remove the privilege blinders. It may be impossible to completely remove every last trace of them. Because of the blinders, it is impossible to fully relate to the experiences of the marginalised. A straight person is never going to fully understand the gut-wrenching fear and doubt that accompanies coming out for the first time. A cis person's not going to fully understand life as a trans\* person. A white American is not going to be able to completely understand the police harassing you just because you're a black American. The little things and the big things that add up to shape a marginalised person's life, are honestly too numerous and too pervasive to fully describe. But not completely understanding is okay! The important thing to remember is not to *dismiss* these experiences, just because you can't see them or don't think they happen.

It's these two things together that cause many of the problems between the privileged and the unprivileged. Having privilege is not inherently bad - the bad part is not understanding how it impacts your views and actions. That's the frustrating part, and if you're here, you're probably well on your way to fixing that problem.

##Use Your Powers for Good, Not Evil

A tl;dr of everything up until this point:

&gt; Sit down and listen to the marginalised.

That's all there is to it, really. When you feel hurt or maybe offended by something the marginalised say, try not to get defensive immediately - sit, maybe ask them why they said that (respectfully! they deal with enough crap as it is), and *listen*. Listen to their grievances, listen to their experiences, and listen for their suggestions. If you do this you're on the fast track to being an Amazing Person.

Being an ally of a cause is a constant process, it's not a little medal or a title. Being an ally of a cause means constantly examining yourself, your biases, the biases of people around you, and looking at how and why they form. Let the marginalised lead the show. Allies are like bodyguards, in a sense: your job is to deflect Stompy Privilege Boots headed at the marginalised, perhaps with your own Boots of Stomping +1, and to teach others to take off their blinders.

That's where privilege can actually help you, and might even help you reach further than the marginalised can by themselves (controversial point of view). Sometimes, the only occasion a privileged poopwizard will even begin to consider an alternate point of view is when it comes from a fellow member of the privileged group. The privileged can use their advantages to create more platforms for the marginalised to spread their message. Those stompy boots can knock aside other stompy boots. Taking off your own blinders might encourage those around you to realise what's blinding them, too.

In conclusion: don't blame yourself for your privilege! You cannot control the circumstances of your birth any more than the marginalised can. But starting off with extra advantages is not something to be upset by. Help change the power structures in society, so that EVERYONE gets to start off on an equal footing. It's very tempting to succumb to privilege and look for ""short cuts"", but changing things is not easy. Change is difficult, it is scary, it is risky - and you should do it anyway.

I hated myself too for a *very* long time and I'm only *just* starting to get used to the idea that I can maybe, *maybe* be a good person if I really really try hard enough.  

When you tell somebody you're depressed, they say shit like ""well, just cheer up!"" or bullshit like that.  When you tell people you're ADD, they disbelieve you.  When you tell people you're bipolar, they say you're just moody.  But BPD?  When my mom found out about my diagnosis (she saw a book I was reading on the subject in my apartment), she burst into tears and ran out of the room.  People *hate* you if you're borderline.  They hold it against you, personally.  They say you're manipulative, evil, that you exist to drag people down, they call you a psycho if you're a guy and a psycho bitch if you're a girl.  They look down on you, they persecute you, they make casual comments on major websites that make you burst into tears.  I'm not pretending that other sufferers don't have it bad, and I am in no way trying to belittle your problems, it's just that this is what I see in my own personal life.

Some goddam brilliant armchair psychologist said in a thread about a bad breakup, ""If it matters, she probably has Borderline Personality Disorder and is just being manipulative.""  Well **fuck you too**.  You might as well be saying ""she was probably black and that's why she robbed the convenience store"" or ""she was a woman and that's why she got all hysterical"" or ""she was probably gay and that's why she's a pedophile.""  No.  None of those things are okay, none of those things are *true*, so why is it okay to treat somebody who is **suffering from an illness** that way?  ***I'm not evil I'm sick.***

White, cis* (fuck I still hate that word - but terminology is terminology, in my day to day I stick with straight) really enjoying the everloving fuck out of that white privilege/invisibility thing.

*(Apparently I meant to write straight - though cis still applies, I can comfortably forget my unwarranted animosity to a term I only became aware of three months ago)

Then I started a relationship with a latina who is probably ten to fourteen times smarter than I am (and I think I'm pretty smart, most of the time). She laughed at my racist, misogynistic jokes. We enjoyed our problematic media. Things were going great.

Then one day she sits me down and says, in so many words, I love you, but you're completely deluded, aren't you? There is literally an entire world you have no idea about, one which makes it easy for you to say the offensive shit you say, and if anyone were to get offended, that's on them because 'you're only joking.' But you need to be aware of who you are and what you say.

So naturally I got defensive - really, is there a white, cis male that doesn't get defensive the first time he understands what an utter, world class shit he has been? And we argued. And argued. This went on for weeks. I would make passive aggressive statements, deliberately needling her about point of view about me. I'd remind her about all those times she almost peed herself laughing when I would do my little racist/misogynist jokes. But she held her ground and, god bless her, remained patient (she's an excellent psychologist btw) and really got me to see a few things. It's not about me, it's not about being sorry for how I was born, etc. It's that in her eyes I'm a fundamentally decent guy who is making the same mistakes over and over again because I'm completely invisible to my whiteness and inherent privilege. Nothing more, nothing less. She didn't even want me to change my sense of humor, which always geared towards the dark, and which, she said, in fairness was pretty caustic and mean-spirted to everyone, white males included. All she wanted was awareness of what I was saying. That my privilege not go unexamined simply because it's hard to admit something about yourself that you wish weren't true.

And then as the weeks went on, and I began to pay more attention, I saw her point. Let me rephrase. I felt like my eyes were opened for the first time in years. Posts on reddit that used to just irk me or strike me as needlessly sexist (seriously, is there a single non-sexist meme even indirectly related to women?) began to bother me more. There was more of a darkness. The constant references to rape and forced sex (which I never cared much for in the first place, given mine and my girlfriends history - we were both sexually abused as children) went from harmlessly offensive to 'wow, this dude must really have some unexplored issues.'

And like any newfound awareness, this was just the onion that stunk the more layers you peeled back. Did you guys know that most TV is absolutely fucking terrible? That 'How I Met Your Mother' for instance, is a show that celebrates the lives of serial rapists and their apologists? That 'Law and Order SVU' (girlfriend's favorite show) is one of the most racist pieces of shit since minstrel shows? That almost every popular website says some seriously disturbing shit almost every day? I didn't. I do now. And it makes my little white privileged brain fucking hurt. Things are awful. Why didn't anyone tell me sooner?!

I used to read Jeremy Clarkson's column in the fucking Times for Christ's sake. I mean I always thought he was just kind of a prick, but even in context... I mean, what the fuck could I have been thinking? This man is a complete asshole. Just a horrible, horrible person.

But this is it, isn't it? You can't unlearn this shit. Like the existence of rape culture, for instance. I hate rape. I hate its under-reported, under-examined nature as a crime, I hate the cultural stigma attached to victims, I hate the kneejerk reaction I STILL FEEL when I read about a person accusing someone of rape (could they have gotten it wrong? A misunderstanding? They were both drunk after all...) but then I regain my sanity and all I can think is FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK. This is FUCKING AWFUL AND I CAN'T STAND THAT I STILL THINK THIS WAY. Fucking apologist thoughts. 

And then there's the culture. Our movies. Our TV shows. Our music. Pay attention for five fucking seconds and it really is obvious, isn't it? Women are objects. Barney Stinson is an unrepentant serial rapist, but his victims are all stupid whores, so LET'S LAUGH, EVERYBODY. And seriously, are there any DECENT roles for women that aren't being the wife to an important historical figure? Is the best argument we can make for a strong feminist role model Buffy the Fucking Vampire Slayer? 

So for me, and the whole rape culture thing, the evidence keeps mounting up and very soon I'm going to have to admit, fuck, fuck fucking fuck people like me, we have a fucking awful fucking rape culture. And I hate that more than words can possibly fucking say. But that's the truth, and the anger and indignation and shame I feel is 1/1000th the amount a woman or minority has had to put up with, so really, I have no excuse for getting depressed. This is something I need to deal with instead of plaintively whining about it. There are no excuses or apologism or mitigating factors. Some things are just true.

And now to be brutally honest and reveal myself for the asshole that I am: I hate that this is true. I hate that this is a thing. I honestly thought, and I can't even believe I was this delusional once, that if we just ignored race and gender and sexuality then eventually everything in society is gonna be ok. Make no mistake: This. Is. A. Child's. Thinking.

So that's where I'm at, in a nutshell. I'm not looking for affirmation. I don't want cookies. Maybe if I actually do something worth a damn someday I might deserve a 'hey, you did something exceptional for all people today - really above the call of duty, have a biscuit' cookie, but that day is not today. I have a long road ahead.

I'm sharing my story because I do want to be better, I do want to fulfill the basic requirements of being a human being. I'm not there yet. I'm still an asshole, just maybe less of a complete asshole than I was. But I think I can get there, and I think I'm going to make it because my girlfriend loved me enough to sit me down and say 'You're full of shit.'

So if there's someone like me in your life, man or woman, who you think has the spark of something approaching a decent human being, don't give up on them. Show them that you love them, but pull no punches. I'm just glad I got exposed to this relatively early, before I got too set in my ways, before I had too many years of looking back and saying, 'Jesus Christ, what a fucking asshole I was.'

Edit: Huh. Quite a response. Wasn't expecting this much.

I just want to reiterate what may have been a little lost in my expletive-filled, sometimes incoherent post: don't give up on people you care about. It sounds cheesy, but love and respect are very powerful when it comes to changing someone's point of view. My girlfriend and I are going to be married in a few years, after that, children. I want them to be able to see that their father has the slightest vestige of decency and integrity, hopefully a 1/10 as much as their mother.

As for my anger, it grows by the day. I'm trying to balance what I am learning with my everyday life. I've had to learn to shut up when watching SVU with the girlfriend, as she is well aware of the problems with the show (someone below summed it up very eloquently - the show has gotten much, much worse than it used to be) and is comfortable with herself enough to tune them out so she can enjoy her guilty pleasure. I need to relearn that trick, so I can switch it on and off and not be such a downer sometimes.

But the anger is there, and I want to do something with it. I've been out of school for almost ten years now, and the first thing I want to do once I have some free time is revisit some of the feminist writers I too easily dismissed when I was in college. After that, who knows. I've dedicated time and energy in the past to causes I believe in (ACLU, Planned Parenthood) I should try to get some of my earlier idealism back, and offer the support that I should have been offering all along.

I'm older, I don't have the time I used to. But I have more focus than when I was younger. I also live in an area with one of the highest concentrations of academics in the world. I have no excuses.

I used to only be tired of the repetitive jokes and memes and puns and novelty accounts and could not see past them to the worse things. The biggest problem for me isn't even the blatant racism or misogyny that reddit displays as I consider the average redditor to be a 14 year old who wants to be edgy.

The most troubling issues (for me) are things you don't notice at first, like redditors using ""female"" instead of ""girl/woman"" and other more or less subtle ways they belittle people different from them. Those are things you cannot pass as ""edgy jokes.""

I'm a SAWCSM, but I try to be as un-shitlordy as possible.

I wanted to share this story to let people know as odd as the fempire is, it taught me some very valuable lessons.

I started reading the fempire when the great violentacrez saga happened. I initially was upset with SRS for exposing another users identity. (FOR CLARITY I know SRS had nothing to do with violentacrez)  But i was curious about the situation and figured out SRS had nothing to do with it.

The fempire now had my curiosity and attention. I started reading more and little but little I started to see why this subreddit existed. My final ""conversion"" to the SRS ideals is when SRS had a couple links to poop from /r/pics. Both of links were awesome pictures of little kids. Both threads were littered with pedophilia comments. I thought to myself why would people make comments like this in a public forum? I did some more searching and found a couple more pictures with kids in them on reddit. Almost every single one of those posts had pedophilia comments in it. It shocked and disgusted me.

After this eye opening experience I wanted to learn more. I started learn: more about feminism and why the public needs it, why gender is a sensitive issue, why a lot of jokes here aren't funny, why rape should never be joked about, how society oppresses women and most IMPORTANTLY how to respect people in a proper way. 

Before the fempire I was never disrespectful in IRL or online. What I'm trying to get at that I wasn't a shitlord but not necessarily the most respectful person either. But the fempire opened my eyes on how to treat people with more respect and sensitivity.

I also learned more about myself. I'm your typical redditor I guess. I'm in my 20's, male, white and an engineering major. I learned about male privilege and how not take advantage of it. To get to the bottom of all this SRS has made me into a better person and I really enjoy the change.

I wanted to share this story because I want all you wonderful people to know your making a difference and keep working hard. You have all taught me a lot and I want to keep learning.

Hello friends! So for the past week, since about 3 am GMT last Tuesday, I've been replying to about a reasonable number of the posts linked through SRS asking if they'd met /u/Human_Decency. The results have been interesting, there's been a whole lot of love, often from SRSters, and a reasonable amount of hate/madbro's. I've spawned 2 accounts created to reply to me /u/A_sense_of_humor and /u/WhoAreYouToJudge, the latter of which has since changed their mission to be more generally mad at anything they consider ""feminism"". I've somehow only screwed up and replied to either the wrong account or post twice, one of each. Each time I got a few messages from users informing me of my mistakes within half an hour. I didn't really start with too much of an idea other than missing the great and now sadly defunct MRAbot_2000 and hoping that perhaps a little humour could show reddit where they're lacking empathy for the fellow humans they love to be shitty too.

Anyway, on with some results!

[Posts per sub posted in. (Some posts will be me replying ""Thank you friend!"" to positive comments.)](http://i.imgur.com/To6eW.png)

As you can see the great majority of posts are in the [""family friendly""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/14w60i/reddit_ceo_yishan_wong_it_turns_out_that_default/) default subs! Also, the three subs that enjoyed me pointing out their shittiness the least included Politics, Atheism two of reddit's supposedly biggest progressive circlejerks and Europe which I would have felt would enter the same catagory were it not for their legendary hatred of the Roma. Cringe and Justice Porn, subs devoted to thinly-veiled hatred of those different from the posters, and Rage, a place for madbro's to be mad, all gave me significantly more upvotes and less downvotes.

But what were people enjoying my mild disapproval of?

[Human Decency's greatest hits!](http://i.imgur.com/WOPD9.png)

The top 10 posts sorted by vote balance, coincidently all posts that were over 100, gave us a wide spread of Reddit's shittiness. Misogyny, racism, bullying and mocking suicide victims, creepy harassment, transphobia and a healthy dose of rape culture and MRA awfulness. The last post while deleted spawned a reply far better than all of mine put together by /u/Shaysdays [""If you'd like proof, over the next week, I won't look for them, but every time I come across sexual assault being treated as a joke, I can pm you and send you the link, or tell you the TV show or article."" And she follows through in replies to her own post, ofc there are a lot of them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/14q8s7/its_all_about_the_laundry_nsfw/c7fums2) Note that in all of these posts my replies to anything homophobic do not appear. This is not because I didn't reply to things that were homophobic but I think shows the phenomena that has been noted in Prime that reddit is somehow ""over"" homosexuality. There have ofc been a recent spate of people posting pics from gay weddings/ceremonies post November elections in the US and they've been shouted down for not being special and just karma whoring, internet points being what they were after all along and significantly more important than an expression of their equality and human dignity.

But does upvoting me mean that Reddit approved of Human Decency more than they did of their ""jokes"" and casual shittiness? In the most blatent cases yes, about half the posts I replied too eventually dropped to negative karma, or at least less karma than my reply, posts I wasn't as popular in though tended not to see a drop even if they were approaching peak reddit.

[""Jokes"" about women dying and unable to get healthcare? Definitely more important than human decency.](http://i.imgur.com/b6nxk.png)

[General drunken shittiness targeted at women? Of course that's more important!](http://i.imgur.com/mgMNh.png)

I suppose some solace can be taken that it was the more blatant posts that went heavily negative though. Then again ""I can see why your patients might molest you, you sexy sex object"" ^not ^100% ^accurate ^quote was awarded reddit gold with the downvotes &gt;.&gt; My reply to that post also furnished /u/Human_Decency with reddit gold, on the one hand it's amusing to have given someone that much entertainment, on the other it's cash going to the current reddit administration, eww.

I didn't really start out with a goal for this account, do I think anyone who's seen my replies has genuinely rethought their position of approval of the posts I responded too? Not very likely, I think it's more likely that people who already agreed that the posts were lacking empathy upvoted me, be they SRSters or not. Did I learn anything? Well I knew reddit loved novelty accounts, I knew some really shitty stuff makes its what through SRS. As a relatively recent reader of SRS it did give me some exercise in thinking why the posts linked were ""shitty"". This has been very useful to reinforce things in my mind as I can still have trouble not using shitlord language and not checking my privilege myself at times. Hopefully others who enjoyed my posts have seen they were mainly also linked to by the anti-SRS bot network or the numerous time I was accused of being an SRS bot and may have followed through to check out /r/ShitRedditSays. If this is the case for anyone reading this through looking through my comment history, yes I am an alternate account of an SRS reader. Yes, I am pretty one note. Yes, you should check out /r/ShitRedditSays if you liked my comment, there are other people out there who think reddit can be a really terrible place at times, you don't have to like everything about SRS to enjoy a lot of it and I would suggesting reading around before commenting!

http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2013/01/08/rape-prevention-aimed-at-rapists-does-work/

""The “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign is a public service rape prevention campaign launched in Edmonton in 2010, and adopted by other cities in Canada, which took the radical step of aiming its message, not at potential rape victims, but at potential rapists. It took the radical step of educating potential rapists about what rape actually is. It recognized the role that alcohol commonly plays in rape — and it educates potential rapists that having sex with someone who doesn’t consent, or who is too drunk to consent, or who is passed out and therefore unable to consent, is rape.

The campaign didn’t target the stereotypical media image of rapists, the drooling psychopaths springing on suspects in a dark alley with a knife. It targeted ordinary folks, frat boys and partiers and bar-hoppers and folks who just like to toss a few back now and then… who have been brought up in a culture that teaches that drunkenness equals consent. It was influenced by a study out of the U.K. showing that 48 percent of men ages 18 to 25 did not consider it rape if the women was too drunk to know it was happening. And it teaches them that no: drunkenness does not equal consent, being stoned does not equal consent, being passed out does not equal consent. It had slogans like, “Just because she isn’t saying no… doesn’t mean she’s saying yes.” “Just because you help her home… doesn’t mean you get to help yourself.” “Just because she’s drunk doesn’t mean she wants to f**k.” It had slogans on every poster saying, “Sex without consent = sexual assault.”

And the campaign has been so successful, the number of reported sexual assaults in Vancouver fell by 10 per cent.""

For the new influx of folk that just arrived and long time readers, we felt that it was time we introduced a new required reading list. We wanted to keep it as concise as possible so people will actually *gasp* do their reading while covering all social justice concepts as comprehensively as possible. If you can think of gaps we missed or find us better resources (particularly for explaining Racism 101 and GSM issues 101) that'd be much appreciated. 

Feedback on individual resources and the list welcome too.

**Guide:** This required reading is for everyone who wishes to participate, even those already familiar with the Fempire. If you are unfamiliar with the Fempire and have discovered us through SRS, read the **[ShitRedditSays FAQ] (http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/o0pdv/meta_srs_faq/)** first. First, as a precursor to participating in SRSD you should acknowledge the validity of social justice movements as outlined in the 101 concepts. The clarifying concepts section gives further facts and addresses deeper reasoning behind key social justice movements. Finally, the last section addresses some FAQ-type questions that come up within SRSD. You should search those terms within SRSD before posting about them. While not required, those threads may answer your question and help you avoid a situation where a mod has to remove your thread because of repetition. Doing the required reading is not a replacement for lurking/listening and getting a feel for the community.

1333502173.0,120,self.SRSDiscussion,rs4i5,A Tale of Blue and Orange:  A Hypothetical World of Microaggressions,successfulblackwoman,128,8,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/rs4i5/a_tale_of_blue_and_orange_a_hypothetical_world_of/,"I talked earlier about how racist jokes actually have more of a real world impact than people might realize.  Today I want to try to model why minority groups are so sick of them, and why majority groups don't realize how often they're collectively telling them.

I'm actually going to expand ""jokes"" to include all kinds of microaggressions.  The term is pretty well [defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression) and you can find plenty of [examples](http://www.microaggressions.com/) but for purposes of this post, let's define a micro aggression as any negative behavior which causes some discomfort in the other person but does not rise to the level of requiring retaliation or even calling out.

Think about little things, like interrupting someone multiple times, or aggressively rolling eyes when someone talks, or getting inside someone's personal space.  It may or may not be motivated by prejudice.

Now let us imagine a world filled entirely with blue people.  (I'm using theoretical races here to avoid any emotional charge.)  In this world, everyone commits microaggressions against one another.  Most people do a few every day.  However, people also occasionally do nice things for one another.  For the most part everyone is treated pretty equally.  Sure, the world has its assholes, but we don't really notice them.

Now, let's disrupt the balance of this world and introduce a population shift, such that 20% of the population is orange.

In the model as it currently stands, despite the existence of a minority group, everyone's getting the same degree of micro-aggression.  From the viewpoint of an orange, 80% of the micro-agression comes from the blue population, but that's to be expected.  After all 80% of the nice behavior comes from the blue population as well.

Now let's introduce some stereotypes, add a dash of cognitive failures and see what happens.

Presume two negative stereotypes arise.  The first is that, say, blues are loud and obnoxiously drunk in public.  Orange, meanwhile, are considered to be cheaters at school.  Maybe a few actual examples kicked off the stereotype, but for the population at large its unfounded.

Let's say that, thanks to a popular joke, both ideas spread through the population.  They become part of the collective subconscious.  Nobody is seriously mandating social change, nobody takes the opinion seriously, but both blue and orange start to have prejudice regarding the other.

Neither blue or orange believes their own stereotype, at least not nearly to the degree they believe the stereotype of the other.  The belief might be half-hearted, but it's there.  Enough to maybe make a crack about the validity of an orange education once in a while but ""come on man, it was a joke.""

It might also be enough to cause a college professor to pick a blue candidate over an orange one because he subtly thinks blues are more academically honest.  Or it might cause an orange landlord to exclude blue candidates because they're too likely to damage property during their raucous, drunken partying.  Imagine lots of subtle, snap decisions made from stereotypes, decisions which aren't obviously prejudiced when examined on an individual level, but from which a pattern emerges.

What is it like living in this world as a blue or an orange?  Both of them have negative stereotypes attached, so what's the logical outcome?

Remember that when we first introduced oranges to the group, micro aggressions were evenly distributed.  But with regards to these color based stereotypes, we end up with a whole class of microaggressions that are strictly cross-color.  

Now lets say, on average, that people confine themselves to one color based micro aggression every 4 days, and said agressions are distributed evenly throughout the population.  On average, this means that a random member of the orange population experiences a microaggression every day.  Meanwhile, a member of blue goes two weeks before he experiences a microaggression.

Again, neither blue nor orange is being more agressive than the other.  This outcome comes entirely from the population difference.

If a hypothetical orange complains to a blue, blue has absolutely no idea what the fuss is about.  After all, compared to orange, blue experiences a mere sixteenth of the color-based microaggressions.  Additionally, a researcher might examine the behavior of a population of orange vs blue and conclude neither side is more prejudiced than the other.

Blue's experience with the effects of prejudice is highly diluted, he gets a lot less than he gives.  Orange, on the other hand, gets significantly more than he gives.

You can adjust the frequency or the severity evenly across the population and arrive at similar conclusions.  Even within the microagression framework, you can run in severity from a backhanded complement, ""oh look, the orange won again,"" to the clearly awful, ""I wouldn't trust my daughter with a blue.""  What matters is that as long as individuals are evenly awful, and spread their awfulness strictly across the color barrier, the minority experiences significantly worse results.

Of course this model is an oversimplification.  It presumes mainly one on one interactions.  It misses how a large group can generate intimidation.  And this is merely examining the effect of majority / minority groups in terms of population.  It says nothing for institutionalized power, or the effects of mob rule and violent consequences.  I also haven't examined the probability that people overestimate the times they are affected by microaggressions, and underestimate the times they cause them.

I just hope that the next time you get ready to tell a hilarious joke, you remember that the minority group probably has heard it far more often than you think.  Chew on that the next time you're about to make a totally funny crack at the expense of a really small minority like a trans* person.

There were some unfortunate implications of this post which were pointed out in the comments. I thought I would clarify (I also cleaned up a bit of the initial post to clarify things):

* The gender cue which trumps all others is someone telling you what their gender is. This is now the pronoun you should use unless otherwise stated by the person.

* Yes, sometimes people might lie to lend their arguments ""credibility"", but you have no way of knowing if they're lying.

* The results if you *do* accuse someone of lying are as follows: you catch someone out on something that didn't affect their argument anyway; you deliberately misgender someone who is not male (and possibly trigger them) and/or trans readers may be triggered by the accusation as it is something that we have to put up with continually.

As you can see, there are no good outcomes.

What I'm going to say here is that the interplay of oppressions is not, in my opinion, fully appreciated. In many ways this is a very white middle class feminist place. At least racism is given short shrift, but questions of class, ableism and cissexism are often looked over.

I'm going to focus on class here because I really think that it's a weak point for SRS. I'm not saying we're all snobs who look down on ""the lower orders,"" what I'm saying is that

1. We fail to call out classist attitudes anywhere near enough, and sometimes perpetuate them. In the neoliberal climate that ""westerners"" live in, this is understandable but no less excusable. At least in the UK, we are invited to laugh at working class people, to mock and disrespect them. This permeates politics and the media, and goes hand in hand with widening inequality. The UK was one of the most equal ""western"" societies in the 1970s, and is now one of the most unequal, and so this mockery is very much the laugh of the conqueror over the conquered.

2. We fail to connect class with other forms of oppression. The working class is more diverse and understanding in terms of ethnicity and sexuality than the middle classes, with their gated communities and closed shops (law, media, politics etc). The problems that ethnic minorities face, that women face, that trans* people face, that other GSMs face, (there are others and I'm sorry if I've neglected you) are all amplified by class. 

3. While the response to most forms of oppression is to (rightly) demand respect for these identities on their own terms, the dominant narrative with class is that individuals should escape the working class, which implies that working class people are worthless failures, and thus hurts those that don't become middle class, along with all the other minorities that are working class too.

Very often right wing tropes like ""welfare scroungers"" are interpreted as racist (and they often are) but they make no sense without appreciating the class contempt involved. SRSers often respond to those statements by noting that most people in the US on welfare are white, without saying that it's a bullshit criticism. It's as if to say ""yeah they're losers, but there are white losers too!"" which utterly disregards the class component to the whole thing.

In many ways the problems that SRS has in these respects mirror the problems that the left in ""western"" countries (US, UK, Australia, France, Germany, etc) exhibit in abandoning class politics in order to pander to an imagined dominant middle class.

**What is rape culture?**

Rape, we can all agree, is a horrible crime. It leaves long-lasting physical and psychological scars. Rape is a crime seen by some as on par with murder; there is no one in society who wouldn’t shun rape.

Why, then, are we living in a supposed “rape culture”?

Let me be clear on one point: “rape culture” is not the same as “a culture of rapists”. Rape culture does not demonise men. Rather, rape culture refers to the fact that we live in a society where the behaviour, thoughts, and actions of rapists can be concealed in a socially acceptable fashion. Rape culture allows rapists to justify their behaviours to themselves and hide among the rest of us.

Rape culture, then, could be summarised as:

* A collection of beliefs in society that allows the mindset and behaviours that lead to rape to flourish.

These are beliefs like, 

* Only slutty girls get raped/“Good girls” don’t get raped
* They were drunk, so it was okay
* It’s not rape if you enjoyed it
* All men are horny anyway, men can’t get raped
* Rape jokes are just that - jokes.

There are many, many, *many* more examples.

As it stands, [statistics on rape](http://www.sexualassault.army.mil/files/RAPE_FACT_SHEET.pdf) paint a startling picture. **14.8%** of ALL women were raped at some point in their life. The majority of rapists are men. **85%** of cases are never reported. Of the 15% that are, only 10% will ever be filed. Of that 10%, only a paltry 40% might result in an arrest. That’s **0.6%** of the original cases. *Less than one percent* of all rape will ever end in an arrest.

**Doesn’t it demonize men?**

In a word, no.

Though the majority of rapists are men, these men make up a [tiny minority](http://www.publicintegrity.org/investigations/campus_assault/assets/pdf/Document5_Lisak_study.pdf) of men as a whole. Furthermore, rape culture dismisses or otherwise downplays the threat of female-on-male rape, as well as prison rape. Only an estimated [1 out of 100 cases](http://www.usu.edu/saavi/docs/myths_realities.pdf) of male rape are ever reported.

[More information on male rape.](http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32361)

**The Fear of False Rape Allegations**

Nearly any lengthy discussion on rape will inevitably mention false rape accusations. These false rape allegations are made out to be absolutely horrible, destroying reputations, lives and futures. Women are portrayed as having ultimate power over a man’s fate; just by pointing at him and yelling “RAPE!” she can ruin his life. It is true that false rape allegations can indeed have a significant negative impact on a man’s life, especially if the case then goes to trial. Due to the stigma surrounding rapists in society, those accused will often be ostracized.

The statistics, however, tell a different story. Some [8% of rape cases filed by the FBI in 1995 were closed as “unfounded”](http://www.annalsofpsychotherapy.com/pdf/Winter2008.pdf#page=45). However, the “unfounded” category does not necessarily translate to a false rape claim aimed at ruining a man’s life. From the same report,

&gt; a report of rape might be classified as unfounded (rather than as forcible rape) if the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect, if the alleged perpetrator did not use physical force or a weapon of some sort, if the alleged victim did not sustain any physical injuries, or if the alleged victim and the accused had a prior sexual relationship. Similarly, a report might be deemed unfounded if there is no physical evidence or too many inconsistencies between the accuser’s statement and what evidence does exist. As such, although some unfounded cases of rape may be false or fabricated, not all unfounded cases are false.

Therefore, it is very, very hard to determine actual statistics for false rape allegations. Studies done of false rape allegations have put the possible percentage of false claims at anywhere from 1% to 90%. Those studies which *have* been done are often of limited sample sizes, and not very many have been done. False rape allegations are not the only aspect of rape claims that lack sufficient data; data related to female-on-male rape or prison rape is very rare, often because of the way rape is defined in different countries. 

Although false rape accusations are indeed very serious, this is **NOT** an invitation to treat rape victims callously. Rape victims deserve our support and sympathy; just because some claims are false does not make it okay to treat EVERY claim as if they are false. Furthermore, the rates of reported rape are incredibly low. In 2008, [90,000 women reported that they were raped, but an estimated 75,000 cases were never even reported](http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/data/table_01.html). Against such a backdrop, the sensationalizing of false rape allegations, though they have a legitimate base, does not seem as realistic as otherwise claimed.

To sum up, the actual number of false rape accusations are hard to define, and rape allegations (real or otherwise) already have an incredibly low chance of getting to court because of the lack of failsafes for rape. Though it is very important to assure that the claims are real, there is no reason not to treat victims with sympathy and respect, *regardless* of the perceived validity of their claims. Err on the side of caution, and don't use the possibility of false rape accusations as an excuse to act callously towards rape victims online.

**Victim-blaming and the Just World Fallacy**

A survey in the UK, conducted by Amnesty International, [found that](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16393921&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=115875&amp;headline=asking-for-it-name_page.html)

&gt; **34% believe women who flirt can be blamed if they are raped and 26% say if a woman is in sexy clothing she is partly to blame.** More than a third of people - mainly males - believe girls trying to chat up men are partially or totally responsible for being attacked. A quarter reckon a woman wearing a provocative outfit is at least partly to blame - especially if she has been drinking. One in 12 thinks she is a natural target if she has had a number of sexual partners. And a third believe she is responsible to some degree if she has clearly failed to say No.

This depressing phenomena is called **victim-blaming**, where the victim is blamed - wholly, or in part - for what has happened to them. Think about that for a while.

**Nobody asks to be raped.** Nobody deserves it, no one wants it, nobody “hints” that they want it. End of discussion!

And yet this victim-blaming mindset is very common, even among women. It’s not always as straightforward as “women who flirt are asking for it.” A common rationalization of rape cases is, “well, if you dress provocatively, you’re more likely to be raped.”

[Not](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/776945.html) [so](http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?14+Duke+J.+Gender+L.+&amp;+Pol%27y+125). Although it definitely influences how we perceive the victim, dressing provocatively does not make you more likely to be raped.

It is very important to remember that rape is **not about sex.** Rape is [primarily motivated by rage and/or anger](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/55/5/795/); sexuality is very rarely the main factor in rape. It is about dominating another, using sex as a weapon. 

Another possible reason that victim-blaming is so prevalent is the [Just World fallacy](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/07/the-just-world-fallacy/). The Just World Fallacy is a logical fallacy, where - because of the assumption that the world is inherently fair and just - people who suffer misfortune must, therefore, in some way *deserve* it. This gets applied to rape and rape victims. In a just world, only the guilty are punished; these people have been ‘punished’, so they must have been guilty.

**Common Rape Myths**

There are *loads*, so I will try and address ONLY those which have not already been mentioned in the parts above.

* The view that “real rape” (whatever the heck *that* means) is a stranger jumping out at you from a dark alleyway and overpowering you.

[From RAINN’s information page](http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders): 

&gt; Approximately 2/3rds were committed by someone known to the victim... More than **50% of all rape/sexual assault incidents** were reported by victims to have occured within 1 mile of their home or at their home... 43% of rapes occur between 6:00pm and midnight. 

* There are different ""levels"" of rape/stranger rape is the only ""real"" rape/date rape doesn't count

This one is particularly odious. Repeat this with me: Rape is rape. There is no distinction between different ""levels"" of rape. Rape by intoxication is just as dangerous, and much more common, than rape through the use of physical violence. 

The issue here that confuses many people is the issue of consent if one or both people involved are drunk. If someone uses another person's intoxication as a way to get past their defenses, *that's rape*. Even if the drunk person initiates it, err on the side of caution. Don't have sex with drunk people.

Consent is a tricky subject, and probably worth an entire effortpost by itself. It's a topic with lots of valid points. That said, it's important to remember that enthusiastic consent to sex is always the safest bet, if in doubt get a clear confirmation, and finally remember that consent can change at any time. Just because someone kisses you, it doesn't mean that they will necessarily consent to sex.

[More info on the link between alcohol and sexual assault.](https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/health/pdfs/alcohol_sexual_assault.pdf)

* If she doesn’t fight back or struggle against it, that means she wanted it.

From this [frankly amazing 101 post](http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2009/10/rape-culture-101.html) (which inspired me to write this), 

&gt; [Rapists] rape people who are strong and people who are weak, people who are smart and people who are dumb, people who fight back and people who submit just to get it over with, people who are sluts and people who are prudes, people who rich and people who are poor, people who are tall and people who are short, people who are fat and people who are thin, people who are blind and people who are sighted, people who are deaf and people who can hear, people of every race and shape and size and ability and circumstance.

* It’s a misunderstanding - what if the rapist didn’t know she was saying no?

[Here you go.](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/03/24/why-rape-isnt-one-big-misunderstanding/) 

&gt;  The young men who participated in the study displayed ""sophisticated and nuanced understandings"" of different ways people could indicate sexual refusal. But when it came time to talk about non-consensual sex, these same men were startlingly eager to explain away acquaintance rapes as communication failures instead of deliberate assaults.

* Rape fantasies in women are really common - what if she actually wanted to be raped?

Once again, **no one asks to be raped**. A rape *fantasy* is very different. A rape fantasy, like other sexual fantasies, are typical methods of exploring our sexuality. There are all sorts of reasons why someone might have a rape fantasy, for example they may enjoy the feeling of being dominated or overpowered. Rape fantasies require the consent of *both* participants and VERY careful planning and communication, the result of which is a good time had by both parties. This only works if the people involved have previously consented to it. Being raped is in no way the same as acting out a fantasy. 

**What now?** 

A rape culture is sustained by misinformation. Learning about the truth behind rape myths, calling people out on harmful behaviour such as telling rape jokes, victim-blaming or spreading other misconceptions, reduces the ease with which actual rapists can hide among other people. Rape culture allows rapists to rationalize their actions. It shames and scares victims into never telling their stories and never seeking justice. Ending rape misconceptions will help stop rape.

We hope all of you can make it.

*The Topic:*

**Race: It's not black and white**

This evening will discuss the intricacies of race and racism today. It will go over briefly a history of racial tensions and key events, just to remind us all what's happened in the past to bring us here. Guest speakers will be from varying backgrounds and should help to give a unique perspective on racial relations they face. We will cover topics of interracial tensions, multiracial peoples, different PoC minorities and how race affects them, and a discussion on ""passing"" privilege and how we all identify (or are privileged enough to ignore) race in our day to day lives.

*How to join:*

Join room #SRSEducation on synirc on Saturday April 28th after 6PM EST.

**Do not join** if you cannot answer yes to this question: Do you think your opinion could be changed if you were presented with reasonable arguments?

*Rules:*

* Do not argue over dictionary definitions. We may briefly go over privilege and language use, but we are using the standard sociology definition that *-ism(s) requires both individual advantages and institutional power. Reverse racism don't real.

* Do not use ALL CAPS. You will be kicked.

* Do not use colours. You will be kicked.

* Do not flood chat with many lines of text. I think the current standard is 6 post in 6 seconds will warrant a kick.

* Be polite and respectful, even to those you disagree with. OPs can and will kick based upon their interpretation and reading of content, not on any supposed intent. Intention means nothing, it's up to you to ensure that your text doesn't come across in a mean-spirited or disrespectful way.

* This is a place for education. Please come in good faith. If OPs feel that you are trolling, they will kick and/or ban you. We will try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but we want to keep the discussion flowing and as informative as possible.

* Do not use slurs. Slurs will get you kicked and/or banned. This includes some of the more common but relatively still accepted terms, so you might want to brush up on what's race/sex/cissex/able/hetero/ect-ist.

* If you have been kicked three times in a session you will get banned. Depending upon the severity of the offence, you may have to message one of the OPs in order to have that ban removed. Generally, we will try to remove bans for the next topic.

* Please remember that this topic is for people to learn about their own privilege and how minorities experience the world. Do not interject or comment if you are privileged unless you are asking a question or providing thought-provoking and *worthy* information. If you are trying to argue about a minority person's lived experiences and understandings about their disadvantages in society from a place of privilege, you will be kicked and/or banned.

Today's lesson will be an introduction to transgender studies.

* **Gender is more complex than what we are typically taught**

There is more to gender than just the typical binaries: man and woman, masculine and feminine. There is a whole range of gender identities and gender expressions! Gender is also not the same thing as sex, which is (supposedly) the more “physical” traits we tend to associate with certain genders. It can also be incredibly fluid, instead of a static, fixed thing. Gender is how a person sees themselves and how they relate to the rest of the world.

Think of it this way: we are typically taught that gender is black and white, when really gender is more of a full spectrum of colors, tints, and shades! A person can be all genders, or pangender, or with no gender at all, or agender (or neutrois).

For more information on gender, here are some useful links with information specifically on gender diversity:

* **Even sex isn't so simple.**

Just as we are taught that gender is as ""simple"" as man/woman, we are taught sex is male/female, no exceptions, and that sex is determined solely by sex chromosomes. However, nature allows for far more variance than that! There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of way a person can ""deviate"" from ""100% female"" and ""100% male"" (which, by the way, are pretty meaningless statements!). Sex is determined not only by sex chromosomes, but all sorts of things, including neurological sex, secondary sexual characteristics, hormones, and internal morphology. 

Just because someone has XX does not mean they are female; there are cases of men having XX sex chromosomes. Likewise, XY does not mean male; there have been cases of XY women who have given birth to XY girls. XX and XY are not the only combinations, either! Among some of the different combinations include X, XXY, and XXYY.

There are plenty of other ways a person can have a variance in their sexual development and sex chromosomal variances are not the only ones.

People with in-born sex variances are called **intersex**.

Note: Some intersex people are transgender, though certainly not all. Most are cis, though there are a few that do not identify as either transgender or cisgender.

* **What does the word “transgender” mean?**

The word “transgender” is an umbrella term in reference to people whose gender identity or gendered appearance (or gender expression) is in great odds with what society expects. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, trans men, trans women, agender people, genderfucks, etc.

* **What in the world does “cis”/”cisgender” mean?**

“Cis” means that a person's gender identity lines up with society's expectations of what their gender identity “ought” to be. It is not an insult; rather, it is a term created by trans* activists in order give voice to the unacknowledged benefits non-transgender people get in society. 

In other words, “cis” means “non-trans.”

* **I've been seeing this term “genderqueer” floating around. What does it mean?**

I'm going to start off by saying that not all genderqueer people see themselves as transgender. Many do, but certainly not all, and these people do not necessarily see themselves as cis, either. Genderqueer is a sort of umbrella term within an umbrella term. It basically covers any non-normative and/or non-binary forms of gender.

* **What does the word ""transition"" mean?**

When a transgender person transitions, they are attempting to reveal their true gender to the world, rather than the gender that society has forced upon them. There are many ways to transition. The most basic one is ""socially"" transitioning, such as asking people around them to refer to them by their preferred pronouns and getting a name change. They may also adopt to dress in clothes of their gender, or they may not (this **does not** negate their identity! Gender expression and gender identity are not always the same). They may also opt for medically transitioning, including taking exogenous sex hormones and/or getting chest or bottom surgery. Doing both is the most common way to transition, though some opt only to socially transitioning (not sure if some have opted only for medical transitioning, but I'm sure someone out there has). Transitioning for transgender people is for many a medical necessity, and without it can lead to severe depression, even suicide.

Though most people who are transgender that opt to transition are trans men or trans women, there are some genderqueers and other non-binary identified transgender people who also transition in order to eliminate some or all of their gender dysphoria, or the horrible feeling of not being recognized as their true gender. This is entirely possible, and the news version of the Standards of Care has guidelines for therapists and physicians to follow in order to guide genderqueer and non-binary transgender people along their transition.

Note: **Not all transgender people transition. Not all transgender people can or want to transition. This does not make them less transgender. Similarly, not all transitioning transgender people go through the same process; some get hormones and no surgery, some get surgery and no hormones. There are endless combinations of medically transitioning, and each person's need for transition is a unique journey.**

* **What is “cissexism?”**

Cissexism is the idea that cisgender people and identities, are better, more “natural”, more worthwhile, and more “real” than transgender people and identities. It often takes form in cissupremacy, or a system of oppression against transgender people. Often, cissexism is very subtle (but isn't always!), and sometimes takes forms in microaggressions, or seemingly small things, like deliberate misgendering of people and scare quotes around people's preferred pronouns and/or name. It also comes in much more overt forms, such as the rape, assault, and murder of trans people (particularly poor trans women of color).

**Transmisogyny** is a specific form of cissexism that has strong ties to misogyny and femme-hate or “femmephobia.” It is the scapegoating of trans women and other people on the trans feminine side and those perceived as trans women or trans feminine. Essentially, it not only views them as “less than” cis women, but also punishes them for being women and/or feminine and transgender.

**Gender binarism** is a more specific form of cissexism that out-right denies or erases genderqueer and non-binary identities and people or views them as “deluded” etc.

* **What is a preferred pronoun?**

A preferred pronoun, simply put, is the pronoun, or pronouns, a person prefers to be used in reference to them. Some people have no pronoun preference, while others certainly do. Some may not have so much as preferred pronouns as “not preferred pronouns.”

Because of gender binarism in society, many genderqueer and non-binary transgender people have had to invent pronouns to refer to themselves in order to feel more at ease.

**What is privilege?**

It's not the dictionary definition. (Which, for the record, is: a right, immunity, or benefit enjoyed only by a person beyond the advantages of most: *the privileges of the very rich.*)

But it does get close. In a social activist-type context, ""privilege"" refers to a set of advantages that groups favoured by society receive, just by being in that group.

Think of it like this: upon birth, members of the privileged group get an invisible jetpack. They're so used to having this jetpack that they don't notice it at all, even though they use it to help them get past daily obstacles. For everyone who's not in the privileged group, the jetpacks are pretty damned obvious. The thing is, if you had the pack on, you'd never notice unless you started looking for it.

This is privilege: benefits or advantages that someone receives by being part of a majority group. (I am referring to a power majority, not necessarily a numerical majority.)

Privilege is very dependent on culture. For example, a white person living in America is privileged, because they are part of an ethnic majority. But if the same person moved to China, the list of privileges they would have would be drastically different. Similarly, a Han Chinese person living in China would have very different privileges if that person moved to a country where the Han Chinese were an ethnic minority.

tl;dr: Privilege is a societal phenomenon, where members of a certain, favoured group have advantages that non-members do not have.

There are many lists on the internet that detail the specific kinds of privilege different groups have. They are generally written as if a member of the privileged group was saying them, but are often compiled by the non-privileged group.

**Who is privileged?**

Generally speaking? Groups which have held power over the country for a long time, and those that society views as ""normal"". In other words:

* racial majorities
* men
* straight people
* cisgendered people
* neurotypical people (i.e. not on the autism spectrum and without mental disorders)
* able-bodied people (people without disabilities)
* sexual people (people who experience sexual attraction)
* religious majorities (if applicable)
* the rich
* the well-educated
* middle-upper class

I'm sure there are more that I've not thought of.

Lots of people are privileged in some way. In fact, I'd wager that most of us are. Remember, though, you can't 'cancel out' privilege. Being privileged in one area and not another doesn't balance out and magically get rid of someone's privilege.

**Being privileged is not an insult.** Being privileged doesn't mean that you cannot be discriminated against, or picked on, or insulted...

...but being privileged *does* mean that you have put up with a lot less crap than people who aren't privileged in the same way. And this is a very important thing to keep in mind. This goes double for those of us who are not privileged in one way, but privileged in another. Always, always, always remember to check your privilege.

When people start denying their privilege, that's when things get ugly. When people ask you to check your privilege they're not being insulting, it's generally just an attempt to ask you to recognize that you might not be as qualified to speak on some topics.

Another effect that privilege has is its normalizing effect on the experiences of the privileged, and its othering effect on the experiences of the marginalized. Things that the privileged group experience are the ""template"" for what society sees as normal: for example, the ""normal"" or ""standard"" human being in America could arguably be a white, middle-class, educated straight cis man. Those are all traits of privileged groups. Minorities or other people who don't have those same privileges are seen as the ""other"", forming a barrier between the privileged and the non-privileged. This has massive consequences; off the top of my head, one of them is the use of this non-privileged identity as the sole defining characteristic of a character in media (if you know TVTropes, think of tropes like The Chick or the Magical Native American). This is like putting a minority character in the spotlight and going ""hey, look! Isn't this person *strange*?"" Needless to say, this is very offensive.

**Intersectionality and Passing Privilege**

What do I mean by ""intersecting privilege""? Well, as I've said above, privilege comes in many forms and in many different areas. Sometimes, these areas overlap. A rich man, belonging to a racial majority, benefits from many more privileges than a poor woman belonging to a racial minority. But when you start having different combinations of privilege, this starts to get a little tricky.

Essentially, you can be non-privileged in one way, but privileged in many others. The net effect is, therefore, positive: you are disadvantaged in some aspects but have an advantage in many more. This is why, for example, men can say that some women do better than them. This is true, but completely misses the point: that the *majority* of women are not, and - because of privilege - don't have access to the same kinds of resources or opportunities.

For example, an upper-middle class person benefits from the intersection of privileges from being financially secure, being part of the middle class and presumably being well-educated. If the person is also part of a racial majority, that person benefits from another form of privilege. In short, this person enjoys many different intersecting privileges (class, financial, education and ethnic majority privileges). 

**Passing Privilege** (Thanks to throwingExceptions for help on this bit.)

Quite a lot of how people interact with other people is dependent on perception. In fact, sometimes what people think you are is more important than what you actually are. Passing privilege stems from that. If people think that you are a member of a privileged group, they will treat you the same way, and so you have access to the same advantages.

For example, a closeted gay man might be able to pass very easily for a straight man. Therefore, he'd have passing straight privilege so long as he does not come out. Of course, the major problem with passing privilege is that it's all based on keeping the assumption intact. (For example, the gay man's ""straight assumption"" - he is assumed to be heterosexual.) Passing privilege can happen without any move towards acquiring it specifically, or by intentionally hiding or obfuscating the truth, or by outright lying about it. Possessing passing privilege is sometimes a major barrier, as fear of losing this privilege can sometimes form an obstacle to confronting the truth about yourself.

Passing privilege can also be described as ""conditional privilege"". Conditional privilege makes it somewhat clearer that this type of privilege depends on a certain condition being maintained; this conditional privilege is gone once people no longer perceive you as part of the majority group.

As far as I'm aware, term itself comes from mixed race people who could ""pass"" for white, and so could enjoy white privilege - provided that assumption was never lost.

**SUMMARY:**

Privilege is a social phenomenon, where members of a favoured group get advantages that other groups don't get. Privilege comes in many forms and in many different areas. Privilege does not cancel out; being privileged in one area does not remove privilege in another. It is possible to benefit from more than one form of privilege at the same time. If people think that you are a member of a privileged group, even if you aren't, you have ""passing privilege"". 

Last but not least: one thing that is universal to ALL privilege lists is that the privileged group never has to be aware that they are privileged. Knowing is the first step to dismantling this whole unfair system.

I write this in the interest of understanding the plight of black communities from a perspective of intertwining interests, from ordinary white citizens to mayors and city leaders to developers and urban planners. I will write post as a case study of Baltimore, where I went to college. 

Residential segregation in urban areas had one of its starts in Baltimore as the first major city to create a racial zoning law drafted to keep white and black citizens separate from each other. In 1910, an ordinance divided the city into black and white areas on a block by block basis. To quote the ordinance in question, [which you can read here](http://www.sundaymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/19101225-2-baltimore.pdf).

**1. That no negro may take up his residence in a block within the city limits of Baltimore wherein more than half the residents are white.**
 
**2. That no white person may take up his residence in such a block wherein more than half the residents are negroes.**
 
**3. That whenever building is commenced in a new city block the builder or contractor must specify in his application for a permit for which race the proposed house or houses are intended.**

Other cities across the South such as Atlanta, Louisville and Richmond, VA quickly caught onto the idea. The practice was eventually challenged in [Buchanan v. Warley](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0245_0060_ZS.html), which deemed such blatant racial discrimination unconstitutional as a breach of the 14th Amendement. From that point, such residential discrimination became a gentleman's agreement between mayors and important developers to not only block large investments in designated black areas, but to prevent black homeowners from buying properties in these areas. As tbe Great Migration saw hundreds of thousands of Southern blacks crowd to these neighborhoods, landlords made fortunes on the perennial shortage of apartments new migrants could rent.

Before this time, the federal government had largely ignored the choices of such cities. In 1934, the National Housing Act was passed to slow the rate of foreclosures in the midst of the Great Depression. It also allowed banks to  categorize neighborhoods by risk for future investment, forming the foundation of redlining. Blacks were denied loans to buy properties in their both increasingly black and traditionally white areas.

Fast forward to the end of World War II, when the G.I. Bill allowed returning veterans access to low interest loans and fueled urban sprawl and white flight from the nation's large urban areas. The end of the war had left black veterans without these benefits and many brought their families north and increasingly west looking for work. As an increasing college educated population left cities, so did the manufacturing jobs that had been at the heart of their economies. In Baltimore, [Bethlehem Steel slowly shrunk its manufacturing base from its peak in 1960 (35,000) until the late 80s where its workforce was less than 10,000.](http://www.nathanielturner.com/robertmooreand1199union3.htm)

[Efforts to desegregate our urban areas have been thawed by the lax enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which remains to be treated on a systemic basis instead of case by case.](http://www.propublica.org/series/living-apart) It had also prevented by a sure refusal to integrate the region using any mass transit system. [What was once a fairly comprehensive 70 mile long system](http://www.roadstothefuture.com/BRRTS.html) was shortened to one simple line, approximately 15 miles long, connecting Johns Hopkins Hospital to the Inner Harbor and the Green Spring Valley  surburbs northwest of the city.

[tw for discussion inside]",laurieisastar,124,25,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/168qcb/debunking_the_debunking_of_the_washington_post/,"I wasn't sure where to put this. I decided on SRSD, but if this is not the place, I'm happy to repost in the correct subreddit.

Ok. So, I don't know if any of you have seen the infographic from the Washington Post depicting the [proportion of rapes to false rape claims](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/01/rape_infographic.jpg). But it's been making its way around the internet. I came across, in the wild, the Men's Rights ""debunking"" of that image. Before I link it, **HUGE TRIGGER WARNING** for a picture depicting graphic violence (more on that later). The infographic was posted to Men's Rights [23 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/166d02/the_truth_about_false_rape_accusation/) and is sitting at +1492 (+2586/-1094). Here's a direct link to the image if you don't want to wade into MR. Cannot emphasize the trigger warning enough. [Here](http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/5836/24675342.gif). 

It made me really really angry. So angry, in fact, that I spent way too much time combing over each bullet point. Not surprisingly, the only this that isn't bullshit is the image in the top left corner of Stephen Lyne. Anyway, if you see this image on Reddit, challenge that shit.

**#1: Prof. Kanin's major study of a mid-size Midwestern U.S. city over the course of 9 years found that 41% of all rape claims were false. Kanin also studied police records of two unnamed large state universities, and found that in 3 years, 50% of the 64 rapes reported to campus police were determined to be false, without the use of polygraphs. (Cited E. Kanin)**  

Dr. David Lisak has written extensively on sexual assault and false rape allegations. Hilariously and ironically (to me at least), he currently holds a position at the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at UMass Boston. Anyway, he has said ""Kanin’s 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape. It certainly should never be used to assert a scientific foundation for the frequency of false allegations.""(Lisak, D. (2007). False allegations of rape: A critique of Kanin. Sexual Assault Report, 11, 1-2, 6, 9). This is because **1.** It lacked any sort of *real* scientific methodology (including a failure to utilize any type of coding system, nor independent coders to prevent bias). **2.** It did not independently check false accusations, but relied on the police department's conclusions, thus by definition building a HUGE bias into his study (particularly egregious since the police department he was studying used procedures 
that are now specifically discouraged by the U.S. Department of Justice and denounced by the International Association of Chiefs of Police). You can read more about how ridiculous this study was [here, on page 1323](http://www.icdv.idaho.gov/conference/handouts/False-Allegations.pdf). Oh also, the police department Kanin studied has never been revealed, meaning Kanin's results can never be verified. 

By the way, that link also contains an actual, legitimate study of university students, using similar constituents that Kanin did, but designed by a respectable scientist. They found a 5.9% rate of false reports. Another study, the largest and most scientifically rigorous study of false reports *ever* by the British Home Office which studied rape reports spanning 15 years found [an 8% false report rate](http://library.npia.police.uk/docs/hors/hors293.pdf). It should be noted however that the categorization of ""false"" was still up to the discretion of police officers, who discounted reports depending on things like the intoxication or mental illness of the victim, without conducting a full investigation.

Oh and lastly: [""Kanin (1994) himself cautioned against the generalizability of his findings from a single police agency handling a relatively small number of cases, calling for future studies in other cities to help assess the representatives of these statistics.""](http://www.law.depaul.edu/centers_institutes/family_law/pdf/duke_lacrosse_case.pdf).

**#2: A landmark Air Force study in 1985 studied 556 rape allegations. It found that 27% of the accusers recanted, and an independent evaulation revealed a false accusation rate of 60% (Cited C. McDowelll)**  

That paper raises some serious questions as well. It's not available online, at least that I can find, so I'm relying on other sources. According to [this group](http://www.mediaradar.org/mcdowell_kanin_credible.php), McDowell did two studies of the same data. The first try found 80 false reports. The second, of the same data, found ""60% of 556 rape allegations"" false. That equals 334. The same group of researchers, using the same data, did this twice, and found the rate of false rape allegations increased over 300%? This doesn't disprove their findings, of course, but at the very least implies some serious methodological flaws. I'm also intrigued as to why [the Center for Military Readiness says that the rate of rape found by McDowell was 27%, not 60%](http://tinyurl.com/aac92bt). And [this one says it was 45%, not 60%](http://www.theforensicexaminer.com/archive/spring09/15/). What gives?

Also, recanting a rape allegation is not necessarily correlated with the veracity of the report. 

**#3: The FBI has compiled crime statistics to show that women lie far more often about rape than other crimes. (Cited B. Danks)** 
 
I spent some time googling the source on that third point, and as far as I can tell, The Politics of Sexuality by Barry Danks does not exist. If it does, it's not on the internet. Therefore: major citation needed. Preferably one from the FBI that shows these statistics about women lying far more often about rape than other crimes. Out of curiosity, especially given Men's Rights activists favorite point that men are raped more than women, do men also lie far more often about rape than other crimes? Anyway, even if you can pull up this book/journal/whatever, Barry Danks is not a credible source. Mr. Danks is a former professor who has made a crusade of [ending the stigma and disapproval of teacher-student relationships](http://dankprofessor.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/crushing-student-crushes/). He even has a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/groups/234909767093/) dedicated to the cause of getting rid of rules which ban teachers and students from having relationships (which are obviously banned because of the *obvious* power imbalance and conflict of interest.) He also once compared banning these relationships to the ban on interracial relationships, in this [article](http://www.ejhs.org/volume1/bdank.htm). I'm at risk of slipping into a ""poisoning the well"" fallacy here, but since I can't find or read the source, I'm going to take my chances. 

**#4: Feminists claim that 1-in-4 of female students will be the victim og sexual assault or rape during their time at college. The number is actually 1-in-1877. Even if you drink the Kool-Aid that 90% go unreported, it's still only 1-in-188. Crime statistics are publically [sic] available from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and Duquesne University (Cited some dude on a blog)**
  
Holy shit, really? We're citing random blogs now and saying it's fact because this one dude did some flawed math on a napkin? This source is complete shit until it's written and peer-reviewed like all other usable, credible sources. I thought Reddit loves science? I can already see a gaping hole in this dude's methodology. Saying that the 1-in-4 statistic (which, as many feminists would probably admit, needs a reexamination) is disproven because there aren't an equivalent of *reported sexual assaults* is like, the, worst designed study bias I have ever seen. Another guy in the comments notes that this guy interprets that 25% of college women are assaulted each year and not in their time at college. 

There are plenty, plenty, plenty of studies that are actually conducted by trained people who know what they're talking about that find a much less ridiculous number than 1-in-1877. Including [this study by the Department of Justice](http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/e03021472.pdf):
&gt;The most recent large-scale study, including students at both two- and four-year colleges, found 35 rapes per 1,000 female students over seven months (rape was defined as ""unwanted completed penetration by force or threat of force""). Based on this study, a college with 10,000 women students could experience 350 rapes a year. This conflicts with official college data. *In 1999, reported forcible and nonforcible sexual offenses totaled 2,469 incidents for all U.S. college campuses combined, underscoring the low levels of rape reporting*.

But no. Let's go with the idea that women just aren't assaulted at all, instead of the Occam's Razor approach that says people and colleges just aren't reporting the numbers. 

Just for shits and gigs, here's International Association of Chiefs of Police explanation about what is and is not a false accusation:

&gt;The determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be made only if the evidence establishes that no crime was committed or attempted. *This determination can be made only after a thorough investigation.* This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to prove a sexual assault occurred. In that case the investigation would be labeled unsubstantiated. *The determination that a report is false must be supported by evidence that the assault did not happen.* (IACP, 2005b, pp. 12-13; italics in original)

This doesn't mean the accused must be guilty if such evidence is not found, and it also doesn't mean that if the case is dismissed or dropped that it was a false accusation. Also [""Cases in which the victim is unable or unwilling to cooperate, in which evidence is lacking, in which the victim makes inconsistent statements, or in which the victim was heavily intoxicated frequently get classified as “unfounded” or “no-crimed” (e.g., Gregory &amp; Lees, 1996; IACP, 2005b; Kelly et al., 2005; Rumney, 2006).""](http://www.icdv.idaho.gov/conference/handouts/False-Allegations.pdf). So anytime you see someone say ""unfounded"" claims are the same as ""false rape,"" yell at them.

In conclusion, there is no mass conspiracy to defraud men. It's also incredibly fucking difficult to determine how many false rape accusations there are, but the vast majority of scholars who aren't wingnuts who advocate for teachers banging their pupils say the proportion of false rape claims to actual rape is really low.

PS: I googled the case of that beaten young man in the bottom left corner. The man who assaulted him should be in jail, and I will stand up right along anyone else condemning vigilante justice. However, [nowhere in the article (TRIGGER FOR THE GRAPHIC PICTURE)](http://thesun.mobi/thescottishsun/news/4671526/Paperboy-is-innocent-victim-of-a-vigilante.html?mob=1) does it say the girl lied about her rape. Merely that the prosecutor chose not to pursue it. As we have seen above from the IACP guidelines about what constitutes a false rape claim, this does not meet those standards. Blatant lie in this ""corrected version"" (and a pretty fucking gross one since it's using the graphic image of a beaten boy to push that lie).

I was laying in bed yesterday thinking, and my thoughts wandered here.

And I had an epiphany, and how something being a ""joke"" is not an acceptable reason for something. It isn't that SRS doesn't ""get"" humour, it's that the ratio of jokes made about visible minorities, women and homosexuals is **incredibly** disproportional to the number of similar jokes made about straight white men, and SRS's circlejerk, while not balancing it out, does something like that.

So while much of reddit may not be *overtly* misogynistic, racist and homophobic, it still is disturbingly easy to see how much it pervades everything, and how everything is done under the pretense of a ""joke"".

I enjoy offensive humour. It's my favourite type of humour, but it has to be clever. Saying *""hurr durr watermelon fried chicken""*, doesn't cut it at fucking all. And the average redditor seems to think it does, and isn't reflective of their bigoted viewpoints. 

I don't know if I'm on the right track here, but I hope I am.

While researching this post, I found this comment. It really resonated with me, and I wanted to know what [/r/SRSDiscussion](/r/SRSDiscussion) thought of it: 

&gt; I say this not to generalize an entire group of people but to reflect my personal experience. I have known and been friends with (and lived with, and dated) many, many gamers. And in my experience, the gamers I knew were as a whole the most blatantly and unapologetically misogynist and homophobic people I knew. Being called feminine or gay (often synonymous in this context) was the worst type of insult you could levy against another person. 
	
&gt; The worst threat in their lives was not sexual violence or gender bias, but ""censorship"" - the idea that anyone could ever stop them from their right to speak. As young, generally-white, straight males, they have never had their privilege truly challenged. Their perception of themselves as cultural outsiders who do not have to follow the same rules. They view themselves as lacking cultural capital in the sense that they are not the richer, more powerful alpha males of the world. They saw themselves as victims of the women who were not sleeping with them, victims to the world that told them they were lesser beings than the richer, more masculine, more powerful men who stood above them. And while they would just as quickly claim that their actions/behavior had no effect on the dominant culture, I would like to point out that the entire marketing industry is driven almost wholly by their demographic. If that's not cultural clout, I don't know what is.
	
&gt; What they didn't understand the fact that their very freedom to speak was actively hurting and oppressing others. They didn't know about the fact that what they thought was ""edgy"" was actually just reinforcing the dominant culture steeped misogyny and which glamorizes rape as an act while at the same turn debasing and blaming its victims. They did not think about themselves in the global or local sense as being so close to the top of the privilege tower that they could nearly touch it. That they, too, are victims of the misogynist culture they help to reinforce. That you can joke about whatever you want to, but that you can't be surprised or angry when someone is hurt, offended, upset or unimpressed with your lack of sensitivity and callous disregard for the lives and experiences that differ from your own. And that telling someone that they aren't entitled to their feelings or experiences is a way that cultural oppression silences people - even if you ""didn't really mean it"" and even if ""it's just a joke"". - [sasshat of Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/100148/Phalluses-Wolves-and-the-Wheaton#3496513)

1366936045.0,91,self.SRSDiscussion,1d4df2,A few good points on classism,starberry697,120,29,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1d4df2/a_few_good_points_on_classism/,"I saw this on Tumblr because I do see a few problems with classism in the fempire every now and again, and I think this is a good summary and hopefully we can expand on it/discuss it further:

&gt;Far too often, I’ve heard radical queers and feminists, in their hipster garb, talking their academic jargon about checking one’s privilege and being accountable, and in the same breath mocking poor people. It’s not always explicit. Actually, in basic human decency circles, it hardly ever is. Many of you know not to say words like ghetto or white trash, or at least I hope you do, because of its classist and racist implications, but that seems to be where the anti-classist work stops. So, let me help you.

&gt;Every time you push your vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian diet on people, remember that your diet is a privilege that doesn’t make you superior or more of an environmentalist, food justice champion, animal lover or good human. I know you know about food deserts. Well, you don’t have to live in one to not be able to afford to have a restrictive diet.
Furthermore, poor folks went green a long-ass time ago. I don’t get why you feel so special about your mason jars and bicycles. Oh good for you for taking the bus when you could’ve driven. Do you want a vegan gluten-free cookie?

&gt;Yes, Wal-Mart is evil. So, is Urban Outfitters. Get over yourself. The only reason why Wal-Mart is singled out is because poor people shop there and it is easier to distance yourself from the problem. So, stop judging poor consumers who are just trying to feed and clothe their families, and start working to dismantle capitalism, or at least organize for workers’ rights (preferably in a non savior complex kinda way).
Your shitty college dorm room, apartment or shared house, does not make you poor, neither does shopping at Good Will.

&gt;There is a difference between being broke and poor, much like the difference between acute and chronic pain. Learn the difference. 

&gt;For those of you who do work with poor folks, you are not special, and you are not a savior. Like I said before, drop the savior routine. It makes a big difference when you take the cues from the communities you are serving. And, just because someone isn’t a college educated career activist, doesn’t mean they don’t know what is best for them and their communities. So, don’t be a condescending ass when people don’t talk like you, and practice some real nonjudgmental allyship.

&gt;Pro tip: classy, trashy, hood, ghetto, dangerous/sketchy/seedy (in reference to poor PoC neighborhoods), white trash, etc are all really classist terms and hella racist too. Think about it, why do we specify that the trash is white? Because all other trash must be brown, right? If you don’t have a claim to these words, don’t use them. 

&gt;Anyway, the examples could go on, and if anyone wants to add onto this, please do. I just don’t understand how a community that prides itself on fighting body-shaming and slut-shaming, could be so unequivocally class-shaming. In your own words, you better check your privilege.

&gt;To add: Every time you focus on shaming poor people instead of dismantling the system that makes it cheaper to exploit and abuse human, animal, and environmental resources, you are doing it wrong.

1364941624.0,95,self.SRSDiscussion,1bjony,"It's time to stop shaming bisexuals for ""erasure"".",felicity_dont_real,132,37,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1bjony/its_time_to_stop_shaming_bisexuals_for_erasure/,"Hi, I'm genderqueer.  Or, possibly, agender--I don't really know for sure.   I
don't have a firm understanding of what gender really *is*.  I was assigned a
gender at birth, but I don't identify with it any more than I do the other
gender.  For sure I hate my gender *role*; if I'd known 15 years ago what I
know now, I would quite possibly have made the decision to transition and live
closer to the other gender role.  But at this point in my life, I choose not
to.

So with that in mind, I want to talk about bisexuals, and the fairly common
complaint that a particular meaning of the word ""bisexual"" is erasing people
like me--that is, people who don't identify at either end of the gender
binary.

I am bisexual.  What I mean by that is that I could, potentially, be attracted
to anyone.  Some people prefer to use ""pansexual"" to describe that.  Recently,
I've been hearing quite a lot that my identity is wrong; people tell me that I'm
not bi, but rather than I'm pan, and that calling myself ""bisexual"" is oppressing
people who don't identify with the traditional gender binary.

I find this discomfiting, because I identify strongly with the ""bisexual"" label,
while ""pansexual"" leaves me cold.  That's not to say that people who do identify
as pan are wrong either, only that I don't feel like the word describes me.

So why is ""bisexual"" problematic?  The common complaint seems to be that it
contains the word ""bi"", literally meaning ""two""; therefore it reinforces the
gender binary, excluding genderqueer people, or at best, it requires a scale of
""male"" to ""female"" that all people can be placed on, which still excludes
agendered people.

As far as that goes, I see two problems.

Firstly, words often change their meaning over time.  ""Bisexual"" might have been
coined in an era when we only had a gender binary, but as the concept of gender
expanded, so did the concept of bisexuality.  I, personally, do not know *anyone*
who uses ""bisexual"" to mean ""I am only attracted to people who are 100% male or
100% female""; which, of course, doesn't necessarily mean that such people don't
exist, simply that I don't think this is the usual definition of the word.  To
define a word based on its etymology is an [etymological fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy),
and ignores the *huge* changes which have taken place in discussion of sexuality
since the word first appeared.

Secondly, bisexuality is hardly the only orientation which could be accused of
reinforcing the gender binary; what about ""gay"" and ""lesbian""?.  

I mostly present as my AAB gender; maybe I have some mannerisms or dress habits
which aren't prescribed by that gender role, but in general a random person I
meet could probably identify me as belonging to a particular gender.  So let's
say I begin a relationship with someone who identifies as a gay person of that
same gender.  ""Gay"" usually means ""attracted to the same sex or gender""; so is
that person erasing *my* identity by continuing to identify as ""gay"", even
though they're not the same gender as me?  Should I constantly remind them of
that, until they agree to identify as pansexual instead, just because I told
them to?

I've never heard anyone, ever, argue that.

I'll admit that when I realised I was bisexual, I had no idea that pansexuality
was a thing.  Would I have chosen to identify as pan if I had?  Honestly, I
don't know.  What I do know is that bisexuality has a long history, and besides
the literal meaning, it has a political meaning.  To be bisexual means something
beyond a simple sexual orientation.  I identify with people who have come before
me who identify as bisexual, and with people here, now, who identify as bisexual.
I'm proudly bisexual; it's not just a word that describes who I fuck, it's part
of my identity.

Bisexuals already have to put up with criticisms that gay people don't: we can't
be faithful, or we're not really bi unless we have equal amounts of sex with
either gender, or we have ""passing privilege"" because we can date or get married
to the opposite sex, or even that bisexuality doesn't exist, and we're really
either straight or gay and just can't admit it.

And now it seems we have another criticism: that we're reinforcing the gender
binary and gay or lesbian people somehow aren't.

Frankly, I'm tired of that.  I *hate* enforced gender roles, and the concept of
the gender binary, and the idea that everyone has to pick a gender and stick
with it (or else come out as trans and stick with the other gender).  These
problems personally affect *me*; they stop me from being who I am.  Anyone who
knows me can attest that I'm all for tearing down our society and replacing it
with something that's friendly to queers, whether cishets like it or not.

But you know, I don't think calling myself a ""bisexual"" is preventing that from
happening.  I'm not the one oppressing you; I'm not the person who thinks your
gender identity don't real, and I'm not the person who's denying you your rights
because of your gender, or lack thereof.  

So stop telling me that my identity is wrong, and instead focus on the things
that are holding *all* of us back -- genderqueers, trans* people, gays and
lesbians, and anyone else who falls under the ""queer"" label.

I would like to open this thread to any male rape survivors who would like to share their stories and talk about the challenges they've faced.  Patriarchy hurts and affects all genders in different ways so we should have a thread to talk about men and what they face when it comes to rape.

One of Third Wave feminism's great contributions to feminist theory is the concept of intersectionality which recognizes that there are various separate axes of oppression that intersect in varying combinations in each individual's life. As a result we now recognize race, sexuality, gender identity, size, and so on as separate though interlinked axes along which women (and men and everyone else) may be oppressed and that all of these are just as important and relevant to feminist discussion as womanhood is. 

In my opinion, motherhood is one such DISTINCT axis all by itself. This is a controversial opinion even in feminist circles, even on the Fempire. Many SRSisters and committed feminists argue that on the contrary *childless* women are socially disfavored, or that mothers' oppression is the same as women's oppression, or that it is offensive to say mothers are oppressed when so many infertile people desperately want children. Many are of the opinion that motherhood is a voluntary choice, and since people cannot be oppressed for things they voluntarily choose to be, mothers cannot be oppressed.  

None of these positions are evil or bad or even completely inaccurate. Motherhood occupies a very unique and confusing position in the intersectionality discussion. One of my aims is to clear up this confusion.



My thesis here is that 

(a) mothers' oppression is very often distinct from misogyny, in that mothers experience oppression from being mothers, specifically, not just because they are women. (In fact some mothers are not even women.) 

(b) even regardless of (a) it is useful and necessary to treat it as its own axis of oppression, because that's the only way mothers' issues are going to become visible in society and in maintream feminism. 

**What is my goal?** 

To wake mainstream feminism up from its long sleep vis-a-vis mothers' issues. Motherhood is truly the unfinished work of feminism. I want visibility, I want recognition of mothers' unique struggles, I want solidarity, I want activism from within feminist circles on behalf of mothers. 




**What this essay does not do:** 

Much to my regret, I don't have the time or resources to research this from a global perspective. This essay is very US-centric. Also, I do not analyze at all, not nearly to the extent merited, the intersections of race and mothehood, of poverty and motherhood, of marital status and motherhood, sexuality and motherhood, gender-identity and motherhood (many mothers are not women), and so on. Again, not enough time, not enough resources. I apologize for these shortcomings, and I will do my best to get to these issues in the near future. Another significant mention necessary is other unpaid caregivers. There is a lot of commonality between mothers and other unpaid caregivers. Unfortunately other unpaid caregivers is a topic for another day and another person, as I do not feel qualified to talk about it. 

With that out of the way, here is my argument. Buckle up, knuckle down, and other ck verbs as well, because away we go.


-----------------------------------------------------

##Objections first. This is quite a radical idea, and a lot of people are going to have kneejerk reactions to it. I would like to get these out of the way right at the top.

**Objection #1: motherhood is a choice, and people can't be oppressed for things they choose**

Well... *maybe*. And motherhood is only a choice if we ignore the copious brainwashing and social conditioning of women from birth that their purpose in life is to get married and have babies, if we ignore the humongous pressures on childless women to have children, if we ignore the biological drives of both men and women to procreate (not just have sex but procreate). But how much sense does it make to ignore all those forces? Becoming a mother isn't really a choice if the options are so weighted, is it? Note also that it is NOT a choice on a societal or species level. Motherhood is a must for the survival of our species.

But more pertinently, BOTH FATHERS AND MOTHERS MAKE THE CHOICE TO HAVE CHILDREN AND ONLY MOTHERS ARE PUNISHED FOR IT. This is why the ""choice"" objection is so bogus. 

**Objection #2: childless women are pressured to become moms, and THAT is oppression.**

They absolutely are, and that is absolutely misogyny. I want to be very clear here that this is not an attempt at oppression olympics. I want recognition for mothers' oppression, and that is all. I am not at all saying that childless women have it easy and don't experience nastiness from society for being childless. 

I don't think there is a separate thing as ""childless women's oppression"", however, since that is not really something that affects *every single area of life* in dramatic, unexpected ways the way a Real Axis of Oppression^tm does (definitions are coming up right after this section, you'll see). Instead, it manifests as a rather narrow and contained unpleasantness - ""social disapproval"" - which is why I think it belongs in the larger category of misogyny rather than becoming a separate axis of its own. Motherhood on the other hand, as I will show here, leads to oppression in a HUGE variety of ways to EXTRAORDINARY extents, its effects spilling over uncontainably into unexpected areas of life. Everything from mothers' retirement accounts to mothers' ability to eat what they like to mothers capacity to freely occupy public spaces is affected. That's a classic hallmark of an oppression - the inability of negative effects to be neatly contained into one narrow avenue of life.

In my opinion, the pressure on childless women to become mothers is indirect but strong evidence for mothers' oppression. It's indirect but strong evidence that **in a patriarchy, having children is a way women lose power dramatically**. This is why there exists the disturbingly common phenomenon of abusive husbands and boyfriends [forcing or tricking women/girls into getting pregnant](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20071010_teen_boyfriends/index.html) - because women with children are easier to control, easier to dominate, easier to oppress. So while yes, absolutely, childless women are pressured very hard to get pregnant, and that is terrible and misogyniostic, that only stregthens my case that mothers' oppression is a real thing rather than refuting it. 

**Objection #3: many cis women, trans women and gay women desperately WANT to become mothers but CAN'T, and this essay is offensive to them.**

I sympathize very much with people who want children and cannot have them, but that doesn't make mothers not oppressed in our society. And it does not make *saying* mothers are oppressed offensive in some way. I mean, fighting marriage inequality  isn't offensive to people who are stuck in bad marriages and are desperate to get out, right?

That said, I am absolutely open to people pointing out any insensitive or offensive wording I may have used that might hurt anybody else. It's highly possible I have made such mistakes and I will gladly correct myself if called out. Apologies in advance.





**Objection #4: this is only misogyny, not a separate axis of oppression**

Yes, mothers' oppression has its root in misogyny. But so do transphobia and homophobia - and yet we have no trouble recognizing those axes of oppression as separate. It's not like all mothers are women, either, since many trans men  have given birth and experience mothers' oppression. 

In this essay I'll be showing you how it's *motherhood* and not (just) womanhood that causes mothers to be oppressed. If feminism can recognize that color is an axis and pay special attention ot WoC, that sexuality is an axis and pay special attention to lesbians, that fat is an axis and pay special attention to fat women, then we MUST recognize motherhood as an axis and pay special attention to mothers too. 

**Objection #5: But this sounds like I'm saying childless women are privileged and are oppressing mothers?! How can that be?!**

Actually, no, I am not saying childless women oppress mothers. I'm saying *all of society* does.  It is indeed my argument that non-motherhood (men and women!) is an axis of privilege, in that being nonmothers (of any sex or gender) makes people exempt from mothers' oppression. But that privilege, as usual, is not the FAULT of nonmothers, nor does it mean they are the only oppressors of mothers. Just like male privilege isn't men's fault, and it's not JUST men who perpetuate women's oppression - everyone can use the patriarchy to oppress women, including other women. 

Also note that intersectionality means I'm not saying nonmothers are ONLY privileged and experience no oppression. Childless women, who are a subset of nonmothers, experience a shit-ton more misogyny that mothers may be exempt from (people continually asking them when they will have children, people including mothers condescending to them as if they *are* children or somehow less than a real woman, and so on). One may have non-mother privilege and at the same time experience women's (or other) oppression. 

**Objection #6: mothers have high social status, we practically worship mothers**

I will deal with this in greater detail below, but for now: (a) this is only lip-service, and (b) putting mothers on a pedestal is oppressive for the same reasons and in the same way as putting women or model minorities on a pedestal is. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With that, we're ready to leap into the meat of my argument.

**What is oppression?**

The systematic, socially and institutionally supported, often also internalized, pervasive mistreatment and exploitation of a group or category of people in varied spheres of life (rather than in just one narrow area), even when oppressors may not explicitly intend to oppress. 

(I cobbled this definition together from the wikipedia page on oppression, so as to not need three paragraphs to define oppression. I think this defintion does a good job.) 

*If mothers can be shown to be systematically mistreated and exploited in the manner described above, that qualifies as Real Oppression^tm* 

**What qualifies something as a distinct axis of oppression?**

If that something can be shown to result in oppression when all other characteristics of a person are held constant, then it qualifies as a distinct axis of oppression.

*If mothers can be shown to experience oppression that nonmothers, including childless women, don't, then motherhood can be classified as a distinct axis of oppression.*

**What is the evidence for the existence of mothers' oppression?**


The answer to that is very long indeed and can be found [here: in part II of this essay](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/y5707/mommys_first_effortpost_motherhood_as_an_axis_of/c5sf8c5).

There's the justified criticism of some of the techniques they use, but sometimes it goes much further and inadvertently throws stones that hit innocent glass houses- mocking those just for needing help with dating. It's almost the reverse of slut shaming. People-who-for-whatever-reason-are-unsuccessful-at-dating shaming. 

But of course, whenever someone comes to this place, askwomen, or TwoX for help, they're often told to be himself or herself. Which is not tremendously helpful, considering their track record. When faced with not changing, or going to someplace like r/ seduction, what do you think they're going to do? We all know what Einstein said about insanity, and at least they're offering something new.

I'm envisioning a place where we can get honest critiques, advice and encouragement without judgment on our current situations or sexism and objectification. Maybe help on bar etiquette, fashion advice, conversation help. How to ask out a friend you like with minimal awkwardness or ruining the friendship. How to have a FWB arrangement without any pitfalls. A sex-positive place for people who want to enjoy sex and want the people they do it with to enjoy it, too.

Like... if they're assuming the victim is a liar, surely they should equally assume the alleged rapist is lying about the victim lying?

They always complain about how on the minuscule chance the victim is lying, the alleged rapist's life will be destroyed over a lie.

But if the victim isn't lying (hint: they probably aren't), and the rapist convinces people they are, that's **so much fucking worse**. Now the victim is sent to jail by their rapist. Holy shitting fuck.

As a bit of a preface, i am not neurotypical. i spent my entire childhood homeschooled because the public school system wanted to put me in special ed classes after i was treated like shit in private school. i went to a bunch of summer camps, after school programs, and eventually a public highschool in normal classes.. but i've been called retarded, a sped, all kinds of shit and generally bullied and treated like crap for it forever basically right up until highschool. i've heard pretty much everything you can yell at someone in that category and been taunted in quite a few ways.

I never had any opinion about ""stupid"" other than that it meant acting without thought, in the same sense as thoughtless, being a ""dumbass"", etc. when i saw people up in arms here my reaction was pretty much ""o_o... wut""

I'm not unwilling to accept this, it just reminds me of the furor in bad faith caused over neckbeard, or the whole kerfuffle over ""shitlord"" possibly being ableist against people with affected bowel control. 

i realize no bridge is too far in not being an asshole, but sometimes like the issues we had with special snowflake, it seems like it's a bunch of neurotypical, able bodied(and mostly SAWCSM/Ws in general) sitting around deciding what's theoretically offensive to people in those groups without even being in them.

An effortpost is a long self-post, well written, often with many sources. If it looks like a fairly lengthy blog post, but is on SRSD, it probably qualifies as an effortpost. Note that an effortpost is not just about length, but also about quality; simply writing upwards of a thousand words does not necessarily mean that your post will get a spot on the compilation.

1327548142.0,88,self.SRSDiscussion,ox2mg,I'm starting to think that it isn't okay to use the term 'cracker'.,outwrangle,107,19,338,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/ox2mg/im_starting_to_think_that_it_isnt_okay_to_use_the/,"I recently got into an [argument over in /r/subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/owf3v/a_anticirclejerk_circlejerk_leads_to_an_srs/c3ko9t1) about SRS's satirical use of the word 'cracker'. I started out the argument being pretty sure that it is not hypocritical to call out Reddit for using racial slurs while at the same time using the racial slur 'cracker'. The three premises to my argument for SRS's use of the word ""cracker"" were as follows:

1. It is satire, so there isn't any actual hatred behind it.

2. It does not perpetuate racism the same why that 'nigger' perpetuates racism because it does not have the same historical and cultural subtext behind it.

3. SRS is majoritively white, so it's okay.

However, one Redditor pointed something out to me that I did not know. See, [the term 'cracker'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracker_%28pejorative%29#Etymology) is thought to have come from the south. Slaver foremen used bullwhips to discipline African slaves and these bullwhips made an audible cracking sound when they were used; the foremen who cracked these whips were thus known as 'crackers'.

The Redditor I was arguing with went on to point out that the term 'cracker' *does* perpetuate racism. It perpetuates the notion that white people are inherently oppressive of people of color because they are white. It suggests that all white people are inherently oppressors, just as the slave foremen were hundreds of years ago. It further suggests that all white people are inherently hateful towards people of color and are predisposed to treat them as property.

This new revelation seems to undermine my argument, because:

1. Invalid because ""It's just a joke!"" is not a proper defense.

2. Invalid because the term 'cracker' *does* perpetuate racial stereotypes.

3. Invalid because racism isn't justified simply because it is internalized.

There are also the deeper implications to the word 'cracker'. If 'crackers' are slave foremen, then that means that non-white people are *slaves*, does it not? It seems to me that using the term 'cracker'  perpetuates the cultural roles of white people and people of color; the cultural roles being that white people are powerful (employers, leaders, businessmen) and people of color are only there to serve the 'crackers'.

Furthermore, SRS has a serious image problem. We are already at a disadvantage since we are arguing against racism and bigotry on Reddit, so when we use terms like 'cracker' we are scaring away people who might otherwise be sympathetic to our ideals. They accuse us of hypocrisy and I'm starting to think that they are right. How can we call out Reddit for using racial slurs when we allow 'cracker' to be used openly in our own subreddit?

All this has lead me to conclude that I was wrong, and that it is not okay to use the term 'cracker' as a slur under any circumstances. I believe this now puts me at odds with the rest of my SRSisters, and so I don't want to make that judgment just yet.

I scrolled to the very bottom to look for jokes about straight white men.

Closest thing to it are 9/11 jokes. 

It's weird, right? 

The word ""offensive"" in this context becomes ironic.

Because all the misogynistic / homophobic / white supremacist attitudes in these jokes are *so old* and *so regressive* and not transgressive *at all* within the context of a misogynistic / homophobic / white supremacist community. 

The jokes y'all make about shitlords and their attitudes are *actually* transgressive (and thereby *actually* offensive) within this community, and they fucking *despise* SRS.

Redditors don't want or delight in offensive humor, they want ""offensive"" humor, humor that places them as the bright shining centers of the universe. 

This kind of humor disparages other races, sexual orientations, and genders while celebrating and elevating the race, sexual orientation, and/or gender of the teller.

[TW] The weirdest fucking thing about it is that while so many of these jokes mock and disparage the ""other"", the jokes about pedophiles, especially bloody and violent child rape, are told from the first-person perspective.

Sorry. I spent so long looking at that thread and badly wanted to puzzle out the underpinnings of all this shit. It seems super, super weird to me there are no jokes about racists, rednecks, wife beaters (framing them as shitty and/or subhuman rather than as, at worst, stern disciplinarians).

Full disclaimer: I'm a rich gay white cis-man myself, which is what the HRC is dominated by and works primarily for.

My thoughts on this mirror the thoughts of a lot of LBGTQ individuals: we don't approve of the HRC's politics, their ""pragmatism"" that amounts to throwing almost everyone under the bus, social-networking/bumper-sticker slacktivism, and the creation of a symbol specifically for straight allies.

For more information about the HRC's problematic politics (they've been called the Walmart or Komen of gay rights), you can read about their [aggressive fund-raising](http://sundial.csun.edu/2011/10/equality-for-some-a-critique-of-the-human-rights-campaign/), [endorsement of conservative politicians](http://books.google.com/books?id=Z2MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Kaiser,+Charles.+%2818+July+2000%29+d%27amato+factor+advocate), [exclusion of protections for expressions of gender identity](http://boycotthrc.wordpress.com/), and [role in watering down demands for rights](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/national/09gays.html?_r=0).

More than the HRC's official stands, however, the organization has not done much more than issue supportive press statements for the end of DOMA and repeal of Prop 8. Lawyers and activists that worked tirelessly to bring those issues before the Supreme Court are entirely (or almost entirely) funded by and from other organizations. Thus, the appearance of the HRC's logo all over social networking gives the impression that they actually did a lot (more than anyone!), when nothing can be further from the truth.

But going beyond the activities and non-activities of the HRC: the equal sign is an explicit symbolization of the homophobic, transphobic, bigoted idea that the pride flag and all it stands for is ""too gay"" and flamboyant for the mainstream. It's the easy way to display your political stances without having anyone question your gender identity or orientation. It's the physical embodiment of ""I'm not gay but,"" much like the rebranding of feminism to ""egalitarianism.""

Furthermore, the pride flag was designed by LGBTQ individuals and is *not* associated with any one organization, making it ideal for showing support of all causes (or any of the other flags, like the bisexual and gender queer flags). It came into modern usage primarily to avoid another type of misappropriation: that of the pink triangle and Holocaust imagery/associations.

Like all things in which someone is an ""ally"" of a movement (male feminists, for example), I think what's important is that one doesn't pretend to speak for the oppressed -- which can happen if someone displays/uses the pride flag and isn't, themselves, a LGBTQA person. But it's also *extremely* offensive, I think, to attempt to distance yourself from the movement with qualifications like ""I don't hate men, but"" or ""I'm not a feminist, I'm an egalitarian,"" and ""I'm not gay, but."" 

That message, the ""I'm not gay, but,"" I argue is *intrinsic* to the HRC equal sign. So much so, that I, even before I thought about it, and articulated why I didn't like it (or even researched the actual stances of the HRC or knew that they were the organization behind the symbol), I wasn't comfortable displaying it. I'm gay, and I feel that displaying it would give the impression that I actually was not gay, that I was speaking in favor of gay rights or the euphemist ""equality"" because I was a liberal rather than speaking as someone who vehemently opposes instances of individual, political, and social homophobia because they're *wrong*.

The HRC logo is a statement of political tribes, of politics, and organized ""activism."" The pride flag seems to me to be a statement of pride, identity, and  acknowledgement that gay rights aren't just correct to advance for political reasons, but also for extremely compelling moral and ethical reasons.

Of course, that could be partly my privilege speaking. But I don't think I'm wrong in saying that the equal sign stands for something that people really shouldn't be comfortable with.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_1b4r1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1b4r1v/the_hrc_equal_sign_logo_vs_the_pride_flag/,

And I'm fucking sickened. This isn't any one comment, it's the entire discussion excusing the abuse leveled against this kid. The man's point is NOT that his cousin shouldn't be stealing or pretending to be 'hard', he's just pissed that his cousin did not treat him with the proper deference.

The kid breaks down halfway through it. If there is any one fucking video I would use to make people realize that being brought into this world 17 or 18 years ago does not mean you will have the maturity of an adult, it's this one. At this point, a full grown man trained in martial arts beats a crying child to reddit's thunderous applause.

Might I point out that now is the only time that reddit regards 'urban' culture as deserving of consideration rather than throwing out their ignorant, biased judgement of it?

Hell, it's ok, a former gang member said it was! He could have hit him in the face! He could have attacked him with a chainsaw, so clearly this isn't abuse!

And this is the problem with JusticePorn. It's thinly veiled voyeurism and outright support for violent reactions, no matter the context or supposed offense. Prejudice is regularly featured, so of course bestof eats this shit right up.

In my view, that subreddit is a short step away from being a hate group. I'm posting this here because, as I said, it's not any one comment that's problematic, it's damned near all of them. What do you think of this?

Edit at 17 hours after posting: Hmmm, 6 posts in the past 2 hours about how respectful I should be about beating a kid like a rug, all but one from people who have never posted in any fempire sub before. I wonder where the bridging is coming from?

Anyways, I could link to the mounds of studies that show no correlation between the use of corporal punishment and deference to authority or likelihood to commit crime. In fact, the only real correlation for corporal punishment is likelihood of child abuse. It is not effective at instilling discipline.

But really, the video speaks for itself. The kid starts crying before most of the assault occurs. He's not crying because of physical pain, he's crying because he is used to people in authority over him using this kind of discipline and he knows what it looks like when it's about to happen.

*Ugh the misogynist attack on @femfreq continues, they are now trying to hack her website, email and other social media accounts.*


------------------------

On the upside, this series of events has arguably raised some people's awareness about the level of misogyny women, particularly feminists, have to face routinely online -- and the Feminist Frequency Kickstarter has now earned many, many more times what it was originally asking for. Anita is keeping on and not giving in, despite the hate.

But -- especially as I've corresponded with Anita and feel I 'know' her a little personally, as well as admiring her greatly -- this seems a really horrible, if perhaps depressingly normal for the internet, turn of events.

It's particularly dismal that there seem to be so many foolish and spiteful misogynists online, with so much apparent energy, so many 'allies' and a certain level of tenacity and skill, channelled in a miserable direction.

Is there anything a big and progressive group like SRS can do as a support task force in cases like this? It's an open question -- not trying to suggest any course of action, but it's kind of frustrating to feel helpless when great people with great projects are being harassed on a personal (public) level.

1330727114.0,86,self.SRSDiscussion,qf33g,[Effort] Derailing 101,,115,29,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/qf33g/effort_derailing_101/,"The purpose of this post is twofold. First off, derailing tactics have become common in SRSD, and I hope that this post mitigates their use and minimizes the anger that ensues. Oftentimes I will see people who make derailing comments being linked to the very comprehensive and apt [Derailing for Dummies](http://derailingfordummies.com/) (I've done the same.) However, I've been told that its sarcastic tone may alienate those who have yet to understand completely the 101 issues of privilege. My second reason in writing this to provide allies and other learning folks a resource without the snark.  If you're worried about being seen as a concern troll, or see your comments often being dog piled by angry offended people, this is the post for you. 

Derailing describes a pattern of behavior expressed by members of the privileged class, allies, or other marginalized groups which result in silencing the opinion of a marginalized person or distracting from what a marginalized person wishes to discuss. While privileged people employ these derailing tactics most often, members of marginalized classes may also not understand the nuances of a situation and end up derailing. Derailing causes conversations to shut down and distract from what otherwise could have been a real attempt at education. What follows is a list of common derail tactics I've seen used in SRSD and elsewhere.

**Demanding Education**

This derail occurs most commonly in real life and outside of SRSD, where the conversation usually starts when a marginalized person points out the bigotry in a joke/reddit post/whatever. The offender who first expressed bigotry then will get overly defensive, complaining about PC-ness or over-sensitivity while saying something like ""How could you possibly think I'm bigoted?"" The marginalized person at this point will give up and stop engaging or tell the offender to Google it. The offender then employs this derail to demand an education. 

The reason this derail can be so infuriating is because it attempts to guilt marginalized people into educating when they don't have an obligation. Just because they understand their marginalization does not mean they have the mental energy or fortitude to deal with bigots all the time. They understand that any attempt to educate will most commonly end in a derail because they've had this conversation so many times and have observed this pattern of behavior. In addition, many resources already exist out there for privileged people. If you know how to use Google, Feminism 101, Racism 101, and all sorts of other topics are right at your fingertips. There is no excuse for saying, ""If you won't teach me, how will I learn?"" (This isn't to say you can't politely ask questions; just be careful not to cross the line between asking and demanding.)

**Tone Argument**

The tone argument is where you object to someone else’s argument against bigotry based on its tone. You ignore the truth of the argument based on the way it's presented. It's a common derail tactic used to silence and shut down righteous anger from anti-bigotry activists. Common phrases include: 

* ""I agree/would have agreed if you would say it more nicely."" 
* ""You're not going to convince anyone like that.""
* ""Hate will not solve any problems and will make the situation worse.""

The tone argument can come in many forms: an appeal for allies, or in conjunction with that ""demanding education"" derail, an appeal to eradicating bigotry through education. The most frustrating part of the tone argument is its focus on what the marginalized person is doing wrong instead of the wrong that already occurred (bigotry). We often see it in the form of people ""not getting"" or disagreeing with SRS--they fail to see a need for progressives to have a space to vent their frustration and express anger without being shamed for it. The tone argument also denies the viability of shock tactics (such as glitter bombing or ""die cis scum"" tattoos) and the possibility of people becoming educated despite (or because of) hostility.

**What about the &lt;insert privileged group here&gt;?!**

Most commonly seen in ""What about the menz?!"" form, this derail is the one most MRAs love to use. When feminists want to talk about issues that affect women, MRAs will insert their opinion and write about how that issue affects men instead, frequently ignoring the difference in magnitude of prevalence. That way, feminists will be forced to talk about men, and the conversation turns to how the patriarchy harms both men and women, the topic no longer focused on women's issues. In conjunction with the tone argument, this derail tactic may be used to make the conversation about the feelings of the privileged instead of marginalized people. A different form is ""What about the alliez?!"" where a movement may become derailed by coddling and catering to privileged allies instead of focusing on its main mission of helping the marginalized group. 

**False equivalence**

This happens when you try to make a poor comparison or analogy due to the unequal nature of society. For example:

* ""Having to work for wages is like slavery.""
* ""Saying you hate white people is using the exact same logic that leads white people into being racist!""
* ""You're the real sexist!"" 

False equivalence happens when you deny that systemic privilege exists. An oppressed person who gets insulted for being a member of a marginalized class has it unequivocally worse off than a privileged person being insulted for benefiting from privilege. A woman who has been raped fearing men as potential rapists should not be compared to a woman-hating man. Those two things cannot be equal, so trying to make it seem so is a derail.

**Privilege-splaining**

Otherwise known as mansplaining, cissplaining, whitesplaining, straightsplaining, etc. This is when you try to tell a marginalized person how to feel about their own marginalization. You barge into a safe space or conversation where privileged opinions are obviously not needed and proceed to explain how a marginalized person's opinion on bigotry is wrong. They often begin with, ""As a privileged person...""  It is incredibly infuriating not only because the arguments are usually a combination of derail tactics, but because marginalized people already face being silenced in society. Part of being privileged means that your voice will always be heard over those of marginalized people, even within an anti-bigotry movement. There is a time and place for privileged people and allies to speak, and it is never when a marginalized person is explaining why they take offense to something. In addition, you need to understand that there are conversations about topics where your opinion is simply unneeded. For example: in a post about black hair, you don't have to talk about your poofy white hair or how your cat's hair can get narly and knots, too. 

**Special Snowflake**

This is a marginalized person's counterpart to the privilege-splainer. Basically, a marginalized person doesn't take offense at something so they tell other marginalized people they shouldn't take offense. It's perfectly within your right to feel any way you want about your own marginalization. However, you should not shame or police the words of other marginalized people if they feel differently.

**Oppression Olympics**

Oppression Olympics happens when one person tries to derail the conversation about one marginalization by bringing up another. The term is used when two or more groups compete to prove themselves more oppressed than each other. It attempts to prevent or deflect discussion of one kind of oppression by denying its legitimacy or existence, downplaying its importance, or simply switching the focus to another. Oppression Olympics ignores intersectionality and turns oppression into a competition in which everyone loses. 

**Moving Goalposts** (Courtesy of Benthebearded)

This happens when a marginalized person ends up extending an argument against your claim that is damaging, exposes a logical inconsistency, or draws a conclusion from your arguments that you aren't comfortable with. Instead of rebut their valid points you just say they aren't debating the same thing you are. This happens over and over again, so the refutation of your original point gets so off-track you are essentially ""moving the goalposts"" on the argument.

**Magical Intentions**

This happens when you try to deny the impact of your words by pointing out that you never intended to offend. ""Intentions aren't magical"" means you can't deflect the *hurt* you caused by bringing attention to your intentions. You have already hurt someone, regardless of your intentions. The best thing to do in this situation is to apologize and then move on from there.

ETA: (JulianMorrison) [O]ffense isn't the problem. Oppression is. That's why good intentions don't fix it. What happens when somebody is, for example, sexist, is that they are coordinating their actions with patriarchy - whether or not they know or intend it. It's what the other people are doing that makes what you're doing a problem, rather than a rude idiosyncrasy. Because of them, you don't have the option to be harmlessly misogynist - your misogyny joins with theirs and does harm.

1338451724.0,81,self.SRSDiscussion,udl7p,[Effort] Male rape,,100,19,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/udl7p/effort_male_rape/,"Notice first of all that when we talk about rape in general terms we tend to assume a male perpetrator and a female victim. This is because our ideas of rape are gendered. Rape is an act of subjugation, and subjugation is associated with femininity where as domination is associated with masculinity. Masculinity is also associated with virility, potency and power while femininity is the opposite, weak, emotional and so forth. As a consequence, we have difficulty comprehending the concept of male rape victims. Many people think male rape only happens in prison as a consequence of the isolated all-male gender order established there with dominant men and subjugated (forcefully feminized) men. 

So what do we know about male rape today? It is true that men use rape to dominate other men, but it does not only happen in prison. Further, rape is a complex phenomenon that does not always involve physical violence. Here are some examples of male rape documented by researcher Stephanie Allen (1)

* A middle aged man explains that he used to work at a warehouse. During a regular work day a young delivery man asked him to climb up in to the van to help him unload the goods. The old man froze out of shock when his pants were pulled down and he was raped.
* A young man describes how he got taunted by a group of men in the street for being too feminine. They chased him in to an alley and gang raped him.
* A mentally disabled young man explains that sometimes his friend makes his butt bleed.
* A gay man describes a violent relationship with another man who among other things smashed a mirror over his head and then raped him.

Here are some other cases I have encountered in the past.

* Two men refuse to pay the cab driver and it turns in to an argument. The two men eventually pull him out of the car and force him to perform oral sex on one of them.
* A young man is on the way to his girlfriend’s house late at night. He gets beaten and raped by an older man in a park in the middle of the city.
* At a college party a young man enters the bathroom while another young man is using it. He locks the door and forces him to perform oral sex on him.

Rape is a shocking experience. Male survivors display high levels of psychological disturbance and health problems, even years after the assault (7). Men experience similar trauma as female victims but due to the perception that rape only happens to women some effects appear to be particularly common among male victims. Many victims can or do not want to define what happened to them as rape. With young victims it is not uncommon that they refer to it as “started having sex early” and with older victims they may refer to it as an assault. It is also common that male rape victims start questioning their masculinity. As a man, they think that they should have been able to defend themselves. In cases where they did not resist physically self blame often includes questioning ones sexuality. Since I didn’t resist, does that mean that I wanted it? One study that investigated gender differences in rape reporting concluded that men fail to report rape when it jeopardizes their masculine self-identity while women fail to report rape when the rape does not fit the classic stereotypical rape situation. They also found that women reported victimization more frequently than did men. (8) Because of widespread ignorance about male rape it is likely that it is even more underreported than female rape. Many victims never seek help and try to forget that it happened. King and Woolett (10) found that only 17 out of 115 men who received help from a UK male rape support group had ever reported their rape to the police. Mean time from assault to contact with the support group was 16.4 years.


###Male Rape: Myths And Facts (6)

**Myth:** Men cannot be raped.

**Fact:** Any person can be sexually assaulted. Although some state laws define the rape of men as sodomy or some other category of criminal activity, the reality of the crime and intensity of its impact make sexual assault one of the most devastating acts of violence a man can experience.

**Myth:** The rape of men happens only in prison.

**Fact:** Those who claim that rape of men happens only in institutional settings contribute to the continuing denial of rape in every community. Sexual assault can occur at any time in any place.

**Myth:** Only homosexual men rape other men.

**Fact:**  The overwhelming majority of men who rape other men identify themselves as heterosexual. Rape is an act of violence and power, not an act of sex. Rapists seek to dominate and humiliate their victims.

**Myth:** The only males who are raped are children or very weak adults.

**Fact:** Any male, regardless of his age, class, race. physical strength, or sexual identity can be raped.

**Myth:** If a man experiences an erection or ejaculation while being raped, it means he wants to he raped.

**Fact:** Some men may experience an erection or ejaculation while being raped, not as the result of pleasure or an expression of consent, but as an involuntary physiological response to intense fear, pain, or anxiety.

**Myth:** Very few men, if any, are ever raped. 

**Fact:** Until very recently, male rape remained a hidden crime. Like the rape of women and domestic violence, its incidence was considered low or nonexistent because most cases went
unreported. Evidence now exists that demonstrates that male rape is both a frequent and serious occurrence. Several studies estimate that of the total number of rapes, 5% to 10% involve male victims. Other organizations, such as San Francisco's Bay Area Women Against Rape, estimate that 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 10 men will be raped in their lifetime.

What about female perpetrators? Can women rape men? Yes they can. Violent rape with a female perpetrator happens, but is extremely uncommon. Not all rapes are violent though, and looking at date rape an intimate partner rape female perpetrators are not uncommon. Struckman-Johnson found that 16% of males and 22% of females in an undergraduate sample had been pressured or forced to have sex at some point in their adult lives (9). In a similar study Davies, Pollard &amp; Archer found that 14% of males compared with 24% of females in a student sample had experienced forced sexual contact or intercourse (5).


###Concluding thoughts

The taboo surrounding male rape is a consequence of patriarchy. The masculine-feminine binary renders male rape victims invisible. Men are more likely than women to agree with rape myths and blame both male and female victims of rape (2, 3, 4, 5). These attitudes need to change. Many people are still ignorant about male rape and male rape victims have not received as much attention from researchers and policymakers as they deserve. It is likely that female date rapists just like male date rapists do not see anything wrong with their behavior. Therefore we need a healthy discussion about perceptions of gender and sexuality and particularly about our ideas of consent to possibly decrease incidences of rape of both women and men.

In fact, feminism is a *collection of movements and ideologies.* For the purposes of education, I thought it would be useful to outline the predominant variants of feminism and provide links to essays from each. Please note that these ideologies occasionally overlap, and many feminists identify themselves with several branches or schools of thought at once.

* It would prevent pedophiles from acting on their urges

* It doesn't actually hurt the child

* Pedophiles are people too, and we should stop shaming them

I don't have any words for this. The reason for my posting this in SRSdiscussion is not just to rant about the shittiness of Reddit; I want to ask all of you something about this ""argument"". Is it a means of somehow qualifying the actions of the person who makes the argument? I can't quite fathom how someone would honestly believe that sexual exploitation at a young age *wouldn't* damage a child. I also don't understand the ""it would prevent the pedophiles from acting on their urges"" argument, because it implies that a) pedophiles are *literally incapable* of stopping themselves from raping children, and b) that watching children get exploited would somehow relieve them of these urges.

I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, or is in the wrong place, but I'm a bit flabbergasted by all of this. I really want to understand, though I'm pretty sure that my post is worded terribly and I apologize for its probable LQ-ness.

I am in recovery for an eating disorder and I am friends with, roommates with, and acquaintances with many other people who are in recovery for eating disorders. Most people I know with eating disorders also have a cross addiction with drugs. 

I am very upset with this comment

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/uwuuv/woman_comes_out_as_bulimic_boyfriend_splits_with/c4zac5l

""Normally I disregard single-digit upvote counts but HOLY SHIT THIS IS HORRIFYING. He seriously compares bulimia to a drug addiction. What the fuck.""

I feel very angry right now because I feel this is vilifying drug addictions. Many young women when i first got into rehab thought that it was okay to have an eating disorder but it was ""bad"" to have a drug addiction, so they would only focus on their ED and ignore their drug problems. There are many people who feel that eating disorders in the form of purging or deprivation are the ""good"" or ""virtuous"" type of addiction and drug addictions are the ""bad"" type of addiction. 

In every single treatment program I have been in, my eating disorder has been treated as a disorder and an addiction. I feel invalidated when someone says I am not struggling with an addiction, because I most certainly feel that I am. I use my eating disorder to cope with my feelings, and through my many years of living with and being friends with many other women in recovery I can say that it most certainly acts like an addiction. 

I don't think that compairing eating disorders to drug addictions is bad because I don't think that drug addictions are ""bad"". I think that drug addictions are a sickness and to infer that comparing one mental illness to another one is negative is extremely mean. People with drug addiction already struggle with an extreme amount of shame and I think it is completely shitty to make out drug addictions to be a bad thing to be compared to. They are a mental illness just like any other. They are all equally hard to deal with. On the reverse side, to make it out to seem like an ED is BETTER than a drug addiction is equally shitty because it is making out EDs to be ""good"". 

Thank you for reading and letting me vent my angry and frustration. And I really would appreciate it if no one directly tried to invalidate my feelings right now because I KNOW what I am talking about because I live it.

Let's take a look.

First off, here is a lovely little quote in which she drops the t-slur:
 ""I just don't feel that it's all that sexy. It's weird. And uncomfortable. I look at photos of myself, and I look like such a tranny! It's amazing!"" (http://celebrities.ninemsn.com.au/?blogentryid=318809&amp;showcomments=true)  Thanks, Gaga.  You just equivocated transsexuality with ""weird"" ""uncomfortable""* and ""not sexy"".

She's used that word a lot, in fact....

And when asked if she was trans, she responded with ""No, I'm *really* a woman.""  AKA, transwomen are not women.

She also has a history of using trans people as jokes/shock images in her music videos.  (http://gudbuytjane.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/lady-gaga-sets-the-record-straight/)

Taking into account her use of a ""trans alter ego"" during the MTV awards and her general use of transsexuality as a prop, I think that I can safely conclude that Gaga is a bit of a cissexist asshole.  Particularly when she is marketing herself as a LGBT+ spokesperson.

There are more examples, but I couldn't find them easily so I won't cite them without a source.

*not to be confused with her saying transsexual people are uncomfortable with their bodies, but that looking like them and seeing them makes her/others uncomfortable.

**Proto-feminism** refers to activists and writers who wrote about feminist ideals *before* the formal advent of feminism. *Epître au Dieu d'Amour (Epistle to the God of Love)*, *[Declamatio de nobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus (Declamation on the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female Sex, 1529)](http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-71692)*, [*The Ladies Directory (1661)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Woolley), [*Respuesta a Sor Filotea (Reply to Sister Filotea)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_In%C3%A9s_de_la_Cruz) and [*De l’Égalité des deux sexes, discours physique et moral où l’on voit l’importance de se défaire des préjugez*](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k82363t) are all considered protofeminist works.

**First Wave** (19th through early 20th centuries)

 Concepts | Key Works
:--|--:
Focused primarily on *de jure* (officially mandated) inequalities, including [sufferage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_suffrage), the right to be educated, better working conditions, and double sexual standards. Occurred mainly in the Anglosphere (English speaking nations) and was championed mainly by white, upper class women. **Landmark events included**: [The Seneca Falls Convention](http://www.nps.gov/wori/historyculture/report-of-the-womans-rights-convention.htm) (1848), [Representation of the People Act 1918](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918), The Sex Disqualification Removal Act 1919, Matrimonial Causes Act 1923, Married Women's Property Act, [The Nineteenth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). **The passage of the Nineteenth Amendment is considered by most feminists as the formal end to the First Wave.** | [*Vindication of the Rights of Women*](http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/vind.txt), *[The Subjection of Women](http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/subjwmn.txt)*, *The Matriarchate*, *[Married Love](http://books.google.com/books?id=M13Q0aymFJoC)*, *[Women in the 19th Century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Lawsuit)*, [*The Declaration of Sentiments*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Sentiments), *[Ain't I A Woman?](http://www.womenwriters.net/domesticgoddess/truth.htm)*, [*The Woman's Bible*](http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/wb/index.htm), [*Woman, Church and State*](http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/wcs/index.htm), [*A Room of One's Own*](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/). 

**Second Wave** (1960s through the late 1980s) 

Concepts | Key Works
:--|--:
Focused on *de facto* inequalities, such as official legal inequalities, the workplace, sexuality, the family, and reproductive rights. Tried and failed to add [The Equal Rights Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment) to the US Constitution. Besides this, the movement was *very successful* and many feminist landmark events occurred during this wave. **Landmark events included** [the advent of the birth control pill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill), [Presidential Commission on the Status of Women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women) (1963), [Equal Pay Act of 1963](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963), [Civil Rights Act of 1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964),  [Griswold v.

Concepts | Key Works
:--|--:
 Seeks to challenge/avoid the essentialist definitions of femininity espoused in the Second Wave, which predominantly over-emphasized the experiences of upper-middle-class white women. The Third Wave is focused on further changing stereotypes and depictions of women, as well as redefining the language used to define women. Incorporates queer theory, postcolonial theory, woman-of-color consciousness, globalization, post-structralism, ecofeminism, transfeminism, a rejection of the gender binary, and sex-positivity. The glass ceiling, sexual harassment, maternity leave, single motherhood are all concerns of the Third Wave. **Landmark events included:** [The Feminist Sex Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_Sex_Wars), [The Riot Grrl Movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_grrrl),  [1992 Year of the Woman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Woman), [The Vagina Monologues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vagina_Monologues), [SlutWalks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SlutWalk) | [*This Bridge Called My Back*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Bridge_Called_My_Back), [*To Be Real*](http://www.rebeccawalker.com/work/to-be-real), *Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism and the Future*, [*Becoming The Third Wave*](http://heathengrrl.blogspot.com/2007/02/becoming-third-wave-by-rebecca-walker.html), *Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions and Third World Feminism*, *Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism*",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_pfsf1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pfsf1/effort_the_waves_of_feminism_101/,

My thought process is, maybe I can open someone's eyes to *why* this thing is shitty/not appropriate, and also that I have taken the passive ""Internet culture is a misogynistic, racist, homophobic shithole and always will be"" stance for too long.

That said, I've been getting lots of downvotes, which doesn't surprise me. I'd just like to share my thoughts on this one particular shitty thing I keep seeing somewhere where people will be understanding (because it's hard to wade through a sea of shit without any positive response).

So...I keep seeing the ""Be attractive"" ""joke"" and in addition to downvoting it, I actually tried to explain *why* today over on r/funny. For those of you not familiar, the joke is from an SNL skit about how men can avoid workplace sexual harassment charges. The entirety of the ""advice"" is just ""1. Be attractive. 2. Don't be unattractive."" Implying that women are never harassed by attractive men (they are always flattered/interested) and any attention whatsoever from an ""unattractive"" man will be labelled ""sexual harassment"" (which implies that all ""sexual harassment"" is is women being mean to unattractive men).

[Here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1g4c76/hey_lisa/cagqdy1) to my original comment, as well as the ongoing back-and-forth between myself and a guy who thinks I just can't ""understand the joke."" **I am not asking for any bridging or upvotes on that board**, I would just like to have a discussion here about the many, many problems with this particular joke and how I could better explain this in future.

Edit: Wow, I actually got a good response! The original guy who posted the comment responded to me and, after hearing my interpretation and argument, agreed how it could be offensive and apologized.

I have some thoughts that I think need to be discussed outside of the circle jerk. I'm more than familiar with the Fat Acceptance movement- I'm a follower of HAES, and an active feminist advocate. I recognize that fat people face oppression in our society, and I have faced fat shaming before. However, this dismissal of talking shit about thin people's bodies as somehow less serious irks me for two reasons. 

First, because sometimes, people do have eating disorders. Calling a skinny person anorexic, or ribbing someone because they eat everything and seem to stay thin may seem pretty harmless, but what if the person you're directing those comments at actually has an eating disorder? I have been in situations where I am with someone who I know has an eating disorder, and someone else will rib them for being too skinny, eating too much and staying skinny, eating a lot of carbs, etc. For that particular person, those comments are poison. They are extremely hurtful, and can be triggering. My friend shouldn't have to be out about their eating disorder to everyone in order to avoid those sorts of comments. People just shouldn't say them. It doesn't matter if thinness is valued in our culture in these situations. This is a different axis of oppression than fatness/thinness. These comments can be just as harmful as fat shaming.

Second, because body policing is a feminist issue. Insisting that women are supposed to fit some beauty ideal (and let's be honest, these comments are more often directed at women) is treating women like they are objects who should be pleasing, not people who look like whatever they look like. I believe that this is an intersectionality issue between feminism and fat acceptance. Telling someone they are too thin is not oppressive from the perspective of fat activism, but it is oppressive from the perspective of feminism. This is a fuzzy line, though, and I understand if people disagree with me here. 

So yeah... Basically I think saying things about skinny people's bodies IS just as bad as saying things about fat people's bodies, but not because skinny people face the same oppression that fat people face. Rather, there are different axes of oppression at work here. 

EDIT: Hey guys, I was working from the assumption that everyone here was on board with the fact that fat people are oppressed in our society, and that thin people have privilege over fat people. If you disagree with either of these facts, please go somewhere else. The rest of Reddit is basically already your oyster. Thanks.

_____

[Kyriarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy)

&gt; describes interconnected, interacting, and multiplicative systems of domination and submission, within which a person oppressed in one context might be privileged in another.

Kyriarchy is an [intersectional](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/p8k1z/effort_intersectionality_101/) elaboration of the concept of [patriarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy). Instead of focusing primarily on gender oppression as patriarchy does, kyriarchy allows for an extended analysis of internalized and institutionalized oppression. 

The term was originally coined by [theological feminist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_feminism), [Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Sch%C3%BCssler_Fiorenza). By applying [critical theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory) to classical literary and religious documents, Fiorenza was able to [solidify the concept of kyriarchy](http://books.google.ca/books?id=u7XoAi3VfOEC). Bearing that in mind, the term is largely used by theological feminists, [who are interested in internalized and institutionalized vectors of oppression in Biblical antiquity](http://www.stm.unipi.it/Clioh/tabs/libri/8/16-Teraukalns.pdf). However, the term has become popular in progressive circles, and has earned wide use in the [feminist blogosphere](http://myecdysis.blogspot.com/2008/04/accepting-kyriarchy-not-apologies.html). 

In a kyriarchy, interdependent [stratifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification) - such as gender, race, class, religion, etc - represent *structural positions* assigned to each of us at birth. People inhabit several structural positions at once, and positions with privilege become [*nodal points*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_point_%28optics%29#Nodal_points) through which other positions are experienced. So, for example, in a context in which economic class is the prevailing [privileged position](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nygqe/effort_privilege_101/), gender and race would be experienced through the lens of class dynamics. Kyriarchy conceptualizes power and privilege into a pyramidal scheme of power structure, in which various actors grapple for the upperhand or lord/master role.

&gt; 

&gt; [It is important to see kyriarchy for how complex it is, and to see that we exist on spectrums of privilege and oppression, and the points at which we exist change and vary. However, this is not an excuse for privilege. We cannot deny any or all of the privileges we have at any given point if we are to truly recognize power systems.](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~haydo20s/classweb/world_politics/kyriarchy.html)  

Consider the following examples of kyriarchy at work:^1

Example| Intersections
:--|--:
men of color dominating women of color | race and gender 
straight women putting down lesbians | gender and sexuality
black women being homophobic towards black lesbians | race and sexuality
upper class white men exploiting working class Asian women | class, race and gender
physically able white women deriding disabled black men | ability, race and gender
gay men and women refusing to acknowledge trans men and women in the queer movement | gender/sex and sexuality
indian girls belittling korean boys | gender and ethnicity
a black woman telling a white disabled woman that racism is a bigger problem than ableism | race and ability

The default assumption that every thread is about the US on SRSD is starting to bother me.  I don't know if that thread was supposed to be about Irish Americans or actual Irish people.  If it was the former, then it should really state ""Irish Americans"" in the title.  Many responses immediately start talking about Irish Americans without any explicit statement that they're referring to the US.  In my view, the responses in the thread are implicitly dismissive of the vast majority of the history of Irish oppression, and especially issues surrounding the modern conflict in Northern Ireland.

Throughout SRSD, I see lots of usages of the word ""our"" to mean ""US"" - ""our laws"", ""our government"" etc., as well as ""here"" to mean ""in the US"".  In a lot of cases, threads which are open to discussion by people from any nation get pigeonholed into a discussion about the US, and this discourages contribution from people of other national backgrounds.

This is pretty easily rectified - general discussion threads which do not strictly have to do with the US should not be phrased making implicit reference to the US, and responses should state, rather than imply, that they're referring to the US.

Yes, most people on here are from the US, and the majority of viewpoints will therefore reflect that.

So the left-wing response to Chik-fil-A's bigotry has been boycott, which makes sense to me. Why give your dollars to a company that funnels its profits into hatred? But the right-wing backlash against that boycott has really bothered me. Their argument: that the left-wing boycott is wrong to punish Chik-fil-A for exercising freedom of speech.

Now, ignoring for the moment that the boycott also constitutes an exercise of free speech, what's wrong with this picture? I think there's an analogy to be made for what would happen if we repealed the Civil Rights Act. For those of you that don't know, the Civil Rights Act prohibits private businesses (like Chik-fil-A) from discriminating on the basis of race, among other things. That particular prohibition, however, is particularly controversial because, the right-wing claims, it interferes with the business owner's right to deny service to people of color, which, the right-wing further claims, is a right guaranteed under the 1st Amendment.

Now there are all sorts of (semi-) complicated reasons why the 1st Amendment doesn't guarantee business owners the right to discriminate on the basis of race, but, to add insult to injury, the right-wing also argues that markets solve discrimination. Specifically, the vocal opponents of the Civil Rights Act argue that if businesses did deny service to blacks, the market would force that business to close, presumably through organized customer backlash like a boycott.

Of course, now faced with organized customer backlash in the form of a boycott against Chik-fil-A, the right-wing is claiming that it is unfair to use market tactics to punish particularly disgusting instances of free speech.

I am the proud father of a 2 year old daughter (and 4 year old boy).  I come from a quite liberal family background, and my wife works, in fact in the same field as me and she is (much) more successful than I.  Point being, my daughter is exposed very little to the direct ""boys do this, and girls do this"" stuff in the home, and does not lack for female role models.

That said, I have become fully aware and frustrated by the male focus of our society and the way it will impact my daughter.  A small matter, but just as an example yesterday we went to buy my daughter a lunch box.  No issues here, right?  Well, the store had organized the lunch boxes in a way that clearly delineated the boys' lunch boxes from the girls'.  The girls' lunch boxes (other than some with cartoon characters on them) were bland and blindingly pink.  My daughter picked out a lunch box with planets on it from the ""boys side"".  My son and his friend said ""she can't get that one, it's for boys"" -- when I asked why, they said, in effect ""because it has planets and a rocket on it"".

The message -- the celestial bodies - stars, planets, space - are for boys.  Science, basically, as well.  It's just crazy.

Wile this has huge sexist potential, the very first submission is already pretty interesting.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/r8rcg/ladies_and_gentlemen_i_present_to_you_sane/

The first thing I want to point about this meme is a problem of epistemology.  the status of sane girlfriend is betowed by a man, and this the boundaries of acceptable feminine behavior are limited and determined by male desires.  In this case, the desire for women to act like objects and gratify without complain male demands is accepted as defaultly acceptable, while the imagined alternative scenario with an 'insane girlfriend', the girlfriend asserts her existence as a subject and expresses her opinions about porn instead of automatically bowing to male desire.

The second is the normalization f porn sex.  In case anyone lives under a rock, porn sex is sex specifically designed to be filmed and sold, and since the pleasure of the viewer is paramount and the pleasure of that actors is irrelevant, the sex acts tend towards being a bit 'fucked up' as they say.  Just see the several thousand rage comics about the same tired topic: ""oh oh, I masturbated but after orgasm found my porn choice disgusting"".  And I as a man can attest that when I've used it porn tends to draw me towards acts I find less than decent.

But it is assumed that the woman, if she is 'sane' (ie idealistically objectified) will be totally willing to replicate these porn acts because the man found then to be enjoyable.

Third, I gotta nothing.  Bu lemme know what you think.

Sometimes less explicit than that, more along the lines of 'immigrants have it too easy', 'PC has gone mad', type stuff.

Anyway, I wanted to see if anyone else was feeling this too and what people think should/can be done about it. 

It goes without saying that I'm not averse to people discussing the complexities of immigration. Sometimes people don't get on well together for all kinds of reasons. But. Malta is not France. France is not Denmark. Denmark is not the UK. The UK is not Germany. One doesn't even have to be 'for' immigration** to see the danger in this trend for viewing Europe as a monolith, even with the EU bringing a certain coherency. 

On a personal note, it bothers me to think that the social life I have, in the UK, and that many people in Europe have, where you know and interact with a bunch of people from ... well, saying 'from different cultures' is something of a cliche. It's to do with people having multiple lives all at once, and people existing at a sort of intersection, with the dangers, yes, but also freedoms that involves. It bothers me very deeply to see this so misrepresented to people in America or elsewhere, but the reality is such a subtle thing it's difficult to explain.

I've always thought of myself as a progressive, liberal, compassionate person, however I can't help but recognize various shitlord rational as things I would have said ten years ago. I didn't think that way because I had an agenda, I thought that way because it made the most sense given the data I was working with. The problem is that data set was my personal experience. I valued my experience above all the other ""idiots"" around me.

Over the years I met more diverse people, but most importantly, I learned that my experience is is colored, at all times, by my inescapable context. I will always see the world through the eyes of a white man and I'll always be treated as a white man. Thus I realized the importance of deferring to those in a different context for my understanding of gender, race, etc. Understanding the limitations of our own view, and how much I don't know and will never personally know, inevitably led to less shitlordly  opinions.

Now for something completely different...

I grew up with the Internet. I mean, literally as I grew and matured, so did the Internet. In Jr high I'd have the family computer, a blazing fast p90, on one phone line and my friend's 486 DX2 on the second line both pirating games off local BBS's. Then we were hacking AOL accounts, then by 9th grade I had my own computer and a geocities page. It had animated skulls and blinking text on a fire background. The point is, I'm not new to the Internet. I've always known the Internet was full of pedos and the like, but since they had been there the whole time, it was normalized in my head. I thought of it just as part of how the world is: there are always   sickos online and there always will be. Seemed like the best course of action was to just ignore it, like I did with casual racism.

But SRS has shown that we can make a difference. It isn't just pointless arguing on the Internet, you really can get those who are willing to see to better understand racism, gender, and consent. And you've shown with project PANDA that you can actually do something real about the pedos and it really doesn't take that much work.

It disturbed me and I began to think how it all happened. If you'll grant me a single assumption, I'll share my perspective on why the 'seduction' community can be so corrosive and awful, and how it relates to rape culture.

The assumption: North_america_blows didn't intend to rape, or understand he raped the victim. I think the fact that he didn't try to hide it evidences this ignorance.

Building on that, what went through his mind that led to the rape? How does an innocent dumbass turn into a rapist? I don't really believe in biblical evil or anything like that, so some form of this question has always bugged me.

 The first thing that comes to mind, was that N_A_B wanted to have sex. And by sex, I don't mean he wanted to share the most vulnerable parts of himself with another person with the hope that their two perspectives would fertilize each other and grow into something transcendent. No. He only wanted to put his penis into a woman. However, desire for a personal experience doesn't explain all of what happened. He wanted to tell his friends about it afterwards, and be recognized for doing it.

""Pick up artists"" form a community that values the act of sex, almost to the exclusion of all else— theres something about self improvement in there, but only as a vehicle to obtain sex. Now, we're all members of many communities, but only a few communities strive for identity primacy. You can tell which ones they are, because people say ""I am a [[noun representing community member]]"" as opposed to ""I work with"" ""I own"" or ""I like to.""  For example: I have brown skin, I work in an HR department, I own a prius. Compare that to ""I am a Christian, or… I am a pick up artist.

Now when you consider that these ""I am"" groups introduce a perspective to your mind that you have to satisfy, you might begin understand why the seduction community is a fundamentally creepy organization. If a group introduces an 'other' into your mind who you constantly strive to satisfy, that could be a beneficial. ""What would Jesus do"" could conceivably lead you to feel good for helping others. However, the seduction community introduces a standard to the minds of men that is fundamentally dehumanizing. We see the results in a pure form with N_A_B, he's too young to have a solid perspective on life or have thought everything through for himself, so the mores of the pickup community inform his whole decision making facility, to the point where his sexual experience, regardless of whether or not it would be satisfying to him, is the greatest good he can understand, even over the protestations of a young woman in front of him. 

In the PUA mindset, she turns from a human filled with possibilities into an adversary in his pursuit of sex. Think of how people can lose their heads in the pursuit of some form of wealth or a symbolic product because they feel it'll increase their status or worth as a human being. Then think of how N_A_B ignores all the reality, feelings, and possibilities of connecting with someone around him in order to obtain the 'currency' of the group he belongs to. Sex, the coin which will earn him the accolades of his peers.

The horror really becomes apparent when you see the eager naiveté with which he posted what happened to Reddit. N_A_B believed that *he was doing the right thing*! Something he should be *proud of*!  And he's just a kid! Where did his ideas come from?! I think we have an answer to that question, after all he reported back directly.   

In that way, I think every mention of sex as a commodity encourages rape culture. Negotiate with the woman to use her body! Be tricky if you have to!  It takes a lot less thought to frame a story in those terms, than to imagine and expand on the real values of intimacy. And an advertiser or writer can shield themselves from any sort of exposure of their own vulnerabilities by playing to the popular, crude ideas of sex.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,True,,,True,t3_r6dnv,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/r6dnv/discussion_of_rape_culture_in_the_pua_community/,

It's interesting sitting here at the DMV and being confronted directly with some of the privileges you have.

(For background - middle class able-bodied white single straight cis male, employed as the head of IT.)

I was sitting next to a guy for a few minutes who has a kid and a manual labor job.  Every hour he's at the DMV is an hour he's not getting paid.  At the same time, he couldn't drop his son off at school any earlier than 8, and the further past 8 you get here, the longer you wait.  He was screwed either way.

A lady down the way is juggling a kid, his bottle, what sounds like a call from work, and her car registration.

All these people are taking time out of their day to get these things done.  A lot of them are taking time off work.  They're missing out on pay, or sick leave, or both.

Here I sit, privileged enough that this trip only takes about 10 minutes out of my workday.  The company pays for my computer, subsidizes my cell phone bill so I can have tethering turned on, allowing me to work despite waiting in line for 2 hours.  Why am I privileged here? 


Direct contributions:

* Class privilege (Employed in a position that gives me this flexibility)

* Race privilege (Don't have to wait for a Spanish-speaking teller, not assumed hostile, etc)

* Being single (No family to care for, meaning no coordination with others required)

* Able-bodied (No wheelchair, crutch, or other considerations required)

Indirect:

* Class Privilege (Grew up with computers in the house)

* Education (Parents supported me learning about them, which led me here)

* Race privilege (had some racist/good ol' boy bosses that got me into the industry)



As I finish typing this, I realize that there may be a way to help mainstream the idea of privilege.  I mean, next time you're sitting around waiting for something that everyone goes through, all you have to do is ask yourself ""How is this easier for me than the person next to me?"".  They say change starts with the next generation - schools are already starting to integrate the idea of privilege, and this makes me happy.  My mom, who has always considered herself conservative, was recently introduced to the idea and it's really stuck with her.  (She's a secretary at a diverse-background high school)  

During one of their team building/inservice days, they had a presentation about it.  Everyone was asked to line up along a starting line.  They were given a series of questions.  If you answered yes to one (""Were your parents an attentive part of your education?"" for instance), you took a step forward.  ""How much easier is it to win this race now for some of you?  This is privilege.  You can't go back and change what's already happened, but you can make the most of it.  Recognize the fact that not everyone starts at the same point.  Learn to recognize the position you're in, and how you can help offset that privilege.

1347168758.0,75,self.SRSDiscussion,zlara,"One of my friends on facebook posted about a pretty interesting incident that reflects why ""unchecked privilege"" is a thing, and why it matters.",sick_burn_bro,95,20,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/zlara/one_of_my_friends_on_facebook_posted_about_a/,"There were two facebook statuses on my news feed today.  The first:

&gt;At the University of Houston speech and debate tournament, we had a competitor making a suspiciously large number of racist jokes directed at our team members, with the use of exclusionary language. While all incidents were unacceptable (ESPECIALLY when leveraged with strangers on first-encounter), the most heinous was a decision not to shake hands with one of our competitors upon their first meeting on the grounds that the student ""doesn't really associate with black people."" He told another student that was in line that he should go to the end of the line because ""you're black and I'm white and therefore superior."" 

&gt;I understand (without condoning) the amazing extent to which privilege blinds one to the hurtful nature of words and actions. I might even almost understand (without condoning) the acceptance by one person as an indicator that such behavior might be acceptable to others. But I find it unacceptable to repeat these with such high frequency, making race the first issue on which all humor is based. Then, of course, I also don't condone it anyway because your Totally-Cool-With-It Black Friend is not a racial ambassador. Problems with the dynamic of a so-called friendship that tolerates constantly exclusionary language based on a history of direct discrimination, oppression, death threats, and terror (and which evokes the subtle and oft-unseen-to-white-people racism that still remains) aside, you don't open in such a way with other competitors, and you don't interject any (terrible) humor in a way that disrespects a competitor with an extended hand.

&gt;The tournament said that they would pull him from the tournament. When the powers that be found out that no judge heard it and only 5+ of my students heard it, they decided to leave him in the pool. The slighted competitor from OUR school is expecting to sit out of the second half of the swing because he does not feel welcome at this tournament. When our competitor has expressed in conversation that this behavior is unacceptable, he has been told on multiple occasions (including by other coaches) that he is overreacting. So the person who won't shake hands with black people is still in the pool, and our competitor - a man who was made to feel unwelcome at an educational and purportedly-progressive event, is likely to be out of the pool. 

&gt;So we will no longer be attending tournaments at the University of Houston. We will not spend our tournament dollars at a school that does not stand up against racism, even if it is guised as jest. This is a community that frequently speaks up against racism and speaks for justice, but when the difficult time to act on our principles comes about, the community does nothing - likely in the name of politics. This is unacceptable on so many levels and has all of us at our college livid at the experience.

&gt;So to those of you who say that racism is over, that we live in a post-racial society, or that Those Uppity Black Folks Had Best Stop Having A Chip On Their Shoulders, I say this:

&gt;WAKE UP, FORENSICS COMMUNITY. Your tournaments are hosting competitors who are discriminatory, bigoted, rude, and threatening. Your tournament directors are standing with the abusers against the abused.

&gt;WAKE UP, AMERICA. Racism ain't dead. Institutions still support it, but it's a lot harder to see - especially when you keep looking the other way.

&gt;WAKE UP, EVERYBODY. To some extent, this incident is the result of total blindness on critical issues and a lack of empathy and/or understanding. We all need to use this incident to examine our own privileges and assumptions, as well as in what areas we are defining how our actions affect others, without listening to what those other people are saying.

The second status, which just went up:

&gt;I want to apologize for not giving an update regarding what happened after the incidents listed here. We were busy giving our all at the tournament, and we were proud to take third place in the overall sweepstakes - we're ready to go in tomorrow with all we have and try to get an even better award this time around.

&gt;First, I want to acknowledge the grace exhibited by the members of the debate team - in the face of an event, nearly everybody who came into contact with this incident was stressed, angry, confused, or all of the above. In spite of these emotional (and understandable) responses, the students focused their acts on performing to their fullest capacity at the tournament. Huge shout out to them.

&gt;After the incident, the offending student made another joke in a round where two of our own (and other competitors) were present. A disparaging joke was also made about our director of Forensics by the student. Our students informed us and the tournament director, and based on this incident, the offender was removed from the tournament. The student and coach appealed the decision, and two witnesses were called at the time. From the two witnesses, one corroborated (the other did not recall). What is clear is that both witnesses did not believe the student's words to be a big deal. Regardless of intent, we made the point that the student's conduct was unbecoming of somebody at a Forensics tournament, that what was a joke to one person was a serious matter to another - a student of ours who still is considering quitting this wonderful event. On these grounds, the tournament director finalized the decision to remove the student.

&gt;There are still several problems we have had with this. For starters, the disparaging comments about our coach were treated with far more gravity than those made about our students. Second, that we had to witness a repeat offense has still left many of our students wondering the extent to which the tournament considers these serious matters. And of course the way that the student's coach defended him was concerning; while I understand the instinct to stand up for your own students, there was no question about certain items that were said - the only debate on many of these points was ""whether they were serious.""

&gt;However, the item that matters is that when potentially-exclusionary humor is inserted into the public arena, it is the excluded - and not the excluder - who has the grounds to determine whether a joke is offensive. If I tell a joke that does not bother me, and it bothers you deeply, I have no right to inform you that you are Wrong about how bad my joke is. 

&gt;We are not trying to sharpen pitchforks. I do not wish to see people delight in the emotional trauma the offender experiences as a result of being removed from the first tournament of the year. I also do not wish to see or hear of any comments disparaging the offender's own minority status - this isn't the oppression olympics, but oppression in all of its manifestations is terrible. What we have is a tragic scenario that was created by unchecked privilege (it's not just about the Ivory Tower!), and one which hopefully has been a learning opportunity for the offending student. I hope that in time, the student can rejoin this community as an avid defender of the rights of the downtrodden. At that time, and with an apology for past behaviors, I would encourage our community to take him into the fold and help him as he learns about the deep and often-confusing social reality in which we live. Until that time, all I can say is that there is much learning to be had.

&gt;For those of you who have offered your support to us and to our students, thank you. For the time being, we would like to first have the necessary meetings with our own school administration - this is a PR matter for us every bit as much as it is for the University of Houston, and working with our own administration which has supported us so much is a crucial way of making sure that the well-being of all of our students is secured. We will likely ask you for your help at a later time. For now, your emotional support has been more than enough.

&gt;And, of course, I would like to encourage us all to use this incident into a lens for examining just why discussions of privilege matter - on an individual and personal level. We may intellectually appreciate the perspectives of those in different social settings from ourselves, but to come to terms with the Whole Emotional Reality of living day-in, day-out with some sort of minority or oppressed status is a difficult struggle for us all. Commitment to justice and fighting racism is easy enough when matters are clean-cut; it's a lot more meaningful to be self-aware during these ambiguous and difficult times. We must all take upon ourselves responsibility in accordance to the privileges given to us by society. As members of this world, we use what is at hand to build a legacy of fairness for all. Sometimes, our notions of fairness can come into clash - whether it is on the Speech vs Offense spectrum as here, or in the November election where the Right to the Product of One's Labor comes into clash with the Right to Be Cared For When In Poverty. Let's not forget that at the end of the day, we're all bringing our own mess into this messy world and trying our best to make sense of it all. Let's be civil, let's be productive.

I might preface this by saying that I’m an incontinent person who actually shits himself (hence the throwaway), and that one of the things I really like about the fempire is how much effort is put into being accommodating and inclusive. I also should say that this is all more than a little meta and I considered about putting in SRSMeta before deciding that is in fact no more meta than the original shitlord post.

I was thinking back on that “It’s not that I’m offended” bit that used to be all over the place on SRS. By drawing the distinction between institutional and personal discrimination, one can get conversations about social justice over the hump of “but there are also people out there that hate men.” Because—and I promise I’m not getting all “but what about the men!?” here—on an individual level it’s unquestionable that people are sometimes discriminated against for being male or being white. However, while I think it’s safe to say that most people here are sympathetic to the individual suffering and offense of men and white people who are discriminated against, on a societal level these forms of discrimination are basically trivial and they don’t belong in most conversations about social justice, which are rightly concerned with problems more addressable than stopping donkeys from braying.

By SRS’s nature, it’s something of an offense driven machine. We deal in individual representations of discrimination, which generally reflect institutional discrimination but are occurring at an absurdly trivial level. It’s hurtful and angering to be discriminated against, and it was really awful to be fifteen and shit myself in class. Undoubtedly being unable to control one’s bowels is an ability issue, and people who mock it are ableists to the hilt. However, the associational chain that leads one from being bullied to being triggered by references to shit as something disgusting seems to me like one of those issues that push us back on the hump of “I’m offended,” especially given that outside of middle school you’re generally not treated as if you chose to shit yourself and (often after a rocky, humiliating start) most people manage to sort out their incontinence issues to the point where one isn’t in perpetual danger of embarrassment. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that while part of being an offense driven machine that is also concerned with actual social justice is being open to examining your own faults, another part is exercising some judgment about whether some specific offense deserves redress. I think back to the post on Otherkin, that trans- parody group that was rightly dismissed here as having an illegitimate grievance. In that case, too, the argument-by-analogy would suggest that the Otherkin *should* be taken seriously, but the terms of the analogy only line up in a superficial way.

So when I saw the OP of the shitlord post write:
&gt;I totally agree wit not calling people 'stupid' or 'retarded', but I feel just as bad when hearing anything to do with ""poop"" related things

I was pretty put off, because shitting yourself and being humiliated isn’t any more like having a mental disability than being white and occasionally being discriminated against is like being black.

How is it different to say ""a female should dress conservatively to avoid being the target of rape,"" than ""a person should not display their money in order to avoid being the target of robbery?""

I understand that it is never the victims fault (in either the case of robbery or of rape) and that most rape is not perpetrated by a stranger.  I also realize that while not all potential robbery targets are valid targets, in that they might not have anything to steal; All potential rape victims have what the rapist wants. Is this fact alone enough to condemn the first statement?

I guess the real question I'm trying to ask is: When does urging caution cross the line to victim blaming?

[note: I'm not trying to equivocate the two statements at the beginning, but rather trying to tease out the reasons they are different]

**EDIT: WHAT I'VE LEARNED:**  I've learned from this thread that provocative clothing is not a factor in how a rapist chooses his victim.  The only advice that could be given to people to avoid rape is the buddy system, well-lit areas, and other GENERAL CRIME PREVENTION tactics.   Thanks to those of you who kept it civil.  No thanks to you who tried to psychoanalyze me and say that I had a completely skewed worldview.  I will  now stop responding to people who are misreading/misinterpreting my question or who have obviously not read this *important* edit.  

**EDIT2: MY QUESTION FAIRLY ANSWERED:**  Thank you ItSoBeautiful for not calling me a victim-blaming transactionalist mysogynist, and just simply answering my question.

&gt;(I'm not expert on the subject, but I have a feeling you're not explaining it in a way that the OP can relate to. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

&gt;You can explain it in terms of triggers. What triggers a rapist? What triggers the thief stealing the money you have waving around?

&gt;A thief will be triggered into stealing your money when he sees the money. ie ""There's the money. It will be easy to take. I'm going to steal that money."" You can remove that trigger by not waving that money around.

&gt;In the statement the OP said above, he's falsely equating thief/money with rape/clothing.

&gt;**A rapist is not triggered by provocative clothing and you can't say that dressing conservatively will remove that trigger. A rapist is triggered by, what? Looking submissive? Gaining trust and feeling like he can get away with it?**

&gt;To remove a rapist's desire to rape, you'd need to look confident and not trust anybody which is basically impossible and absurd to ask the victim (and potential victims) to do.

&gt;Basically, there is no way for the victim to remove that desire for a rapist to commit rape. It's just there.

**Edit 3:** I just received this private message:
""Thanks for asking the question about rape prevention in SrsDiscussion because I have been thinking the same things. And every time you got a negative bashing response you told them everything I wanted to tell them.""

Feminists want a career, AND a family. We want reproductive freedom AND doors held open for us. We want equal pay AND automatic custody of our kids in divorce cases. We want to be seen as strong and independent AND perpetual victims. We want to ride the ""cock carousel"" AND eventually find a husband. And so on, and yada yada yada so forth.

Okay, so none of that stuff is even true. But lets pretend it is for a second. Lets entertain the ridiculous notion that feminists are people who want the best of both worlds. People who actually like the patriarchy, but only when it ""suits"" them. 

Aren't MRA's the same way? Lets review some of the contradictory goals of the Men's Rights Movement, **with particular emphasis on traditional conservative sects like The Red Pill.** This is important, so keep it in mind.

1. MRA's say every child needs a father, and that absentee fathers are the cause of a large number of issues in society. **But at the same time they want to be able to abandon their children completely at the drop of a hat, and pay zero child support if they don't want too.** (And do you honestly believe that an MRA run society would grant women the same freedom?)

2. MRA's want to blame female rape victims for their attacks based on what she ought to have done. (ie, dress modestly, stay home after dark, not drink, etc.) **Yet if a woman displays even the slightest bit of apprehension around them, they want to get offended and say it's misandry that women are afraid men will rape them.** Even though it's a totally valid concern. So basically, if you cover your drink and carry mace it's misandry, and it you don't and you get raped, it's your fault. 

3. Certain MRA's claim that traditional gender roles are rooted in biology, and that everyone would be happier and life would be simpler if they would just conform to said roles. Hey, whatever floats your boat. If you want a consensual relationship based on traditional/conservative gender roles, who are we to judge?

But the thing is, MRA/RP men they only like the aspects of trad/con values that serve to benefit and empower them. for example,

a. Traditional gender roles say women are naturally predisposed to obey and serve men = immutable bio truth rooted in evo-psych or whatever.

b. Traditional gender roles say women are natural child rearers, and therefor should be given more consideration for child custody than men = misandrist feminist hamster conspiracy, and totally NOT patriarchy. 

   .4. And lastly, certain MRA's believe men are predisposed to play, referee, and give commentary on the game, and that women are predisposed to sit on the sidelines with water and orange slices. They want you to swallow the ""red pill"" and accept the fact that men are all powerful and women are subservient. AND YET.... wait for it....

**And yet patriarchy doesn't exist, never has existed, and there's no way it ever could exist.**

Yup, according to the MRA's (especially the red pill sorts) men are all powerful, and women are naturally weak and silly, and yet we've somehow managed to create some vast matriarchal, gynochratic tyranny in which being a man/manly is a crime punishable by death. 

Probably with the help of our Beta Orbiter Lackeys.

In conclusion, I would like to say that feminists, myself included, accept the fact that equality means... 

Women will have to sign the draft, unfit mothers will have to give up custody of their kids, (And really, this is a non issue, since men get custody about half the time, when they actually ask for it.) and that women won't be allowed to hit men, (Or that no one will be allowed to hit anyone.) and that we won't be given special attention just because we're women. (And honestly, if guys would stop feigning chivalry/niceness to get with me, and instead afforded me the same decency as anyone else, that would be great.)

Yet, we're the ones who want to have it all? I'd say that our demands are reasonable; afford us the same justice and decency as anyone else. Don't treat us like sacks of meat, but don't treat us like dainty princesses, either. Just, like people. 

MRA's, on the other hand, just want to move the goal post around willynilly, and call it misandry whenever a woman manages to win.

I'm going through various SRS subs, doing as much reading as I can, and otherwise trying to learn. But SRS has made me think about SJ topics way more than I think I should. I'm a SAWCASM and I understand that marginalized groups don't have the option to not think about issues that affect them, but I'm spending hours each day struggling. Morality was so much simpler before I discovered SRS and now I'm constantly questioning whether I'm actually a good person.

Jokes that I previously thought were fine now bother me. Books, shows, movies, and games that I loved before are apparently rife with problematic things. I guess it's a good sign that I notice, but being bothered more often has the net effect of making me less happy, not making me feel like I'm a better person.

I'll admit I've explored antiSRS a bit. Their views tend to be far closer to everything I've been taught throughout my life (in what I thought was a very progressive and accepting home; and still is, relative to most) which made it more palatable to me. But I know deep down that they're wrong. Words have meaning, the world is messed up, and SRS is trying to make it less so.

All that being said, I just want to stop thinking about it so much. If this reeks of privilege, I'm sorry, but I don't want my thoughts to be consumed with social justice yet. I want to be a good person, but I want most of my thoughts to be about school, sports, acne, and girls (or boys), not radical feminism, gender identity, subtle racism, and ableist language (which is so ubiquitous that I wish I could learn to ignore it again).

A final note (and I know this sounds like a Privilege Denying Dude meme): SRS has kind of messed up my masturbating and sexual arousal. It's not just that it's making me question the ethics of pornography (and whether a man has any right to be sex-positive, because of course they will because it benefits their penises), but the entire ideas of objectification and the male gaze and everything are making me feel terrible.

Something came up a few days ago in prime, wherein an SRS poster used an insult directed towards white people (it was either whitey or honkey, I don't recall) to refer to some shitlords saying the usual terrible racist shit.  I replied wondering if this was allowed, as rule III simply says ""No slurs in the jerk,"" and it was explained that derogatory terms applied to privileged groups were not considered slurs.  Everyone was very polite in correcting me and all is well, but it did leave me thinking about this question and wanting to know more from those more knowledgable on social justice issues than I am.  

As someone with several types of privilege, I understand and accept that slurs directed towards oppressed groups are fundamentally different in nature (far more oppressive, more demeaning, pretty much worse in every way) than those used towards privileged groups.  But I had thought that when derogatory terms were used that targeted one or more privileged class, they would still be slurs, as they do imply that someone is wrong mostly because of something they *are*.  

So I have a couple questions, and I'm really trying to ask this in good faith as someone that tries generally not to be a terrible shitlord, so please if I'm off base let me know.

First, perhaps the rule on prime could be clarified to make it more clear that slurs against oppressed groups are not allowed, but similar language directed against privileged groups is allowed?  I see that here on SRSDiscussion the similar rule is much more specific to this end: ""do not use language that demeans or stereotypes marginalized groups.""  I find this much more clear, and while I personally would still not use language directed towards either marginalized or privileged groups, this rule is clear that the only the former is against the rules.   

Second, while I'm on board that slurs directed towards privileged groups are way *less* bad than slurs directed towards oppressed groups (thousands of years of oppression less bad), I don't really think they are good, either, since they do still imply that someone sucks because of something they *are* (white, male, straight, etc) rather than something they said or did.  I guess I personally prefer to let the terrible shit speak for itself and only use insults that could apply to literally anyone (e.g. shitlord, asshole, etc) rather than only apply to some group of which the shitlord in question happens to be a member.  Is this just a personal preference or am I making any kind of sense to others here?

Since I started joining subs for my favorite tv shows and book series I've started noticing a certain bias crop up every so often:

If there's a weak character,

- Is it a man? Bad writing / just ignored in discussions / make a joke out of it

- Is it a woman? Should be thrown out of the story / should be killed / is the worst thing that's happened to the series

The issue I have is not that a female character can't be a bad character. Of course they can be, and sometimes they truly are the worst character in the story. But most of the time, people seem to display a very large bias towards ""forgiving"" (?) female characters.

For example,

In the book series ""The Kingkiller Chronicles"", people think that the character of Denna (which is the only recurring female character of substance) drags the chapters down. There are many other male characters who add absolutely nothing to the story, and who have much less of an impact on the main character, yet people choose the woman who basically friendzoned the main character (regardless of the giant mystery that surrounds her and the fact that she could be pivotal to the plot in the third book).

In the TV series ""Stargate Universe"", I've seen people say that if Chloe were thrown out of an airlock, then the series would not have ended. And yet, this Chloe character managed to solve a bunch of problems for the whole crew on the ship while other, male characters were nothing more than an extra pair of hands required to operate consoles. Chloe did nothing wrong for the series -- oh no wait, she had sex with the buff army guy instead of the math geek.

In the TV series ""Grimm"", some people want to get rid of the main character's wife. This after she has become the overarching plot of the second season. There's no reason why she should be cut. No one ever gives any reason. 

There's also the bunch who hate River in ""Doctor Who"" simply because she's badass and likes to one-up the Doctor... like that's a bad thing.

So, I dunno, it's something of a pattern that I've observed happening. Has anyone else noticed this?

I'm as serious about my atheism, secularism and humanism as I am about feminism (and in fact they're all intimately connected for me), so it has pained me to see bigotry and prejudice instead of enlightenment and progressive thought in atheism. I think A+ is a good attempt at a serious solution. Also, it's inevitable that a growing community branches off into different schools of thought, and I've rarely seen a better reason for a split.

Why is it that we entirely write off progressives or allies who aren't quite progressive enough? A guy like Dan Savage is not like Rick Santorum. He might have some problematic views, but his heart is clearly in the right place. The It Gets Better project is *huge* and that it dismissed so quickly is mind-boggling to me. When somebody like Dan Savage expresses a problematic view, can't we expect them to be more receptive to people giving constructive criticism? Why don't we try to help people who are mostly correct be completely correct instead of writing them off as being as bad or worse than the people who are entirely wrong?

Yes, Dan Savage has expressed a lot of problematic views; mostly in the past, but some more recently. I don't agree with him on all counts. But he's done a whole ton to advance progressive causes and a sex-positive viewpoint. I'm not saying we should give him a free pass, but I definitely don't think he should be fed to the wolves because he doesn't toe the party line as close as we'd like.

When I meet new people, I play a little game. You can play it too! It's very simple: count the time between being introduced to them and when they ask where you are “really from.” Doesn't have to be those exact words, the sentiment will do. Some lucky members of the audience may never have it happen!

You don't know what the sentiment is? Well, let's start from there.

White people\*, in general, do not know the sentiment I am talking about. This is not an insult: they are lucky to never have to deal with it. They never have to deal with either the implicit insult or the greater harm that is caused by it. They can answer “Where are you from?” and never have to deal with it, because no one ever questions their answer.

They always question mine.

The sentiment is this- the unconscious, unthinking assumption that I am a foreigner. The completely oblivious preconception that I, because of the color of my skin and the shape of my eyes, cannot be “from” the same somewhere as my interrogator, that I must be from Elsewhere. They never mean anything by it. If you accused them of being racist they would be shocked, SHOCKED!

And somehow that makes it hurt even more.

But when I say this to people, I am disbelieved. Sometimes it's obvious- “So you're really from China, right?” Sometimes it's insidious- “So where is your family from?” In any case, the message is clear. My Americanness is not real. I am Asian first. I am Foreign. I am the Other. I can see it in the little head nod after I finally give in and say “Well my parents came from China, originally.” They have placed me in the little mental box that says “Chinaman,” and moved on.

These people are not malicious. They are not evil people. They are you (yes you, the reader of these words. You've probably done it.) It seems like such an innocent question. But for me, every instance is another tiny reminder that I Am Not Wanted Here. That this space is not for me. That I will always, always be the Other. So I smile to your face and die a little inside and laugh it off, because if I call it out I'll be the asshole, the oversenstive fucker who ruined a nice conversation with his overreaction to an innocent question. And people wonder why I don't like meeting new people.

Of course, there's a thousand other little reminders of this. The people who try to speak to me in stuttering, toneless Chinese, or worse, Japanese, expecting me to understand and compliment them on their skill at “my” tongue. The people that compliment me on my “excellent English.” The innocent, “So when are you going home?” or “How often do you go home?” The incessant questions about my opinion whenever China is in the news. The sad faces when I admit that I can't really speak Chinese well myself: “Well it's a shame you've lost your culture.” On one hand, assimilate. On the other, lose my culture. Welcome to the double-bind, the Chinese fingertrap, ha ha, of being Asian.

On a greater level, the attitude behind this is dangerous to every Asian-X (insert whatever European or American country you want [Australia can come too]) person. The attitude that we cannot be TRULY a citizen of our countries of residence and in many cases birth leads to terror and death. It the attitude that got Wen Ho Lee prosecuted mercilessly for espionage he never committed (may I add, he was a Taiwanese-American being accused of spying for the PRC. Anyone who actually knows anything about history should find this utterly laughable.) This is the attitude that got me spit on in the street and told to “GO HOME” during the spy plane debacle on Hainan Island (I was twelve.)

This is the attitude that got Vincent Chin murdered.

So what I'm saying is, next time you meet someone, and you get the urge to ask them where they're really from?

Don't. We appreciate it.

1) Shitty statements should be called out as shitty

2) This can be used to educate people and raise awareness

3) You can like problematic things, or you can chose not to like problematic things. 

4) I really don't care how you call 'em out, cursing and yelling or calmly and kindly (although with an exception for death threats and other violent threats)

But I really, really don't like the way that callout culture is evolving, esp. on Tumblr. While yourfaveisproblematic is sort of... approach-neutral, it seems the blog is being treated by others as a sort of 'permanent record' for offenders, and no matter what they do henceforth (apologies, rectification, behaviour change, whatever) they will forever be considered shitty because of the shit you see on yourfaveisproblematic (especially since popular posts may get frozen in their 'first' draft because of how Tumblr's reblog mechanic works, when YFIP issues corrections or updates to his/her/their lists on a regular basis). Like, I've seen people's names used as slurs on tumblr because they've said problematic shit in the past. That's... absolutely bizarre to me. I sure as shit don't like some of the people whose names are being made into slurs, but unlike Santorum or OSC they don't seem to be actively and unapologetically trying to repress other people's rights so making their names into slurs (which will linger forever, being slur-y) seems fucked-up to me. 

I don't like this because it seems to be devoted to assuming the worst from people (e.g. that every shitty thing is deliberate and done in full knowledge of the finer points of cultural and gender studies) and assuming a static nature that does not actually exist in humans.

[Scrubbed Gawker article.](http://i.imgur.com/XRNwU.png)

I thought, upon reading this I'd either find a short little blurb about a guy who lived in a shack by the river, or a teenager who invented VA as a means to an end. What I didn't expect was......what I can only describe as commercialism at the heart of this, and a very normal guy acting abnormally because he'd found a way to turn Karma into actual power. 

I feel the most illuminating part of this article was:

""What was surprising was the community support for it.""

I took this to mean that he knew that what he was posting was offensive, borderline illegal (or at least in a very gray area of the law) and he fully expected people to be disgusted and outraged. He was a self proclaimed troll. I'm sure it comes with the territory. And yet, what ended up shocking him was how quickly the Reddit community rode to his rescue. I can't help but wonder how many times he sat at his computer screen thinking, ""What the hell is wrong with you people,"" as Reddit claimed there was nothing wrong with beating women, having sex with minors, stalking women, etc.  Of course there was something wrong with it. That's why he posted it in the first place. 

With his request to be a ""mole"" and out some of his ""fans,"" I can only assume the answer was very often. 

Personally this article gave me some hope for the future. I wish Reddit hadn't blocked it. I think it would do much of this community good to know that even VA recognized that what he was doing was extremely offensive. Not ""natural,"" as his supporters would argue, not ""covered under free speech."" 

In the article he's quoted as saying, ""People take things too seriously,"" and on that issue I think he's correct -- though not in the way he probably intended it. A portion of his followers think he's serious about beating women and the like. Imagine how much better Reddit would be if those groups could just stop a minute and realize that VA was only playing the part of a villain to earn, for lack of a better word, respect. That their rally calls to defend him made absolutely no sense and would have probably been shut down long ago if it didn't afford him a certain amount of celebrity.

",urban_night,94,24,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/zwf4i/just_want_to_vent_re_stems_and_shitlordery/,"I can't stand it anymore. Why should I have to feel like shit because I chose to study something that isn't ""science"" (it is *science*, just not a natural science or engineering or whatever)? I'm so frustrated. It's difficult for me to brush off because my brother is in bio-something and he constantly rags on me for being in political science. 

Here's what I think STEMshits are not comprehending about social sciences in particular:

They think there's a lack of methodology. I can only speak for economics, international relations, and political science, but I think it's true for all social sciences: not only is there a vast array of methodology, including natural science methodology, but there is a constant debate (for lack of a better word) about it (i.e., should we be more qualitative? Quantitative? Other means?) There are volumes and volumes of books dedicated to research design. Scholars are completely aware of it. 

In fact, the main problem about quantification in the social sciences is the research design. Social scientists aren't working in a lab, they can't control the variables, much less identify them all. And when they can observe them, how do you assign measurement or magnitude of changes in variables? In the instances when scholars have the opportunity to experiment (what is coming to my mind, as someone studying international aid and development, is introducing a program to some areas while withholding from others), it then becomes a question of ethics. So, yeah, it's not a hard science, it's a really hard science. 

Economists can quantify, use models and formulas, because they have numeric data. But, they use assumptions, just like a given in a mathematical proof. Sometimes the models are good, sometimes not, but the whole idea is to generalize. You want to explain the statistically significant. That is something that can be done in social sciences but there's so much you have to pay attention to. 

Here's an example. Last year a senior advisor at USAID came to my university for some seminars. His background was in livestock sciences. He said that they were working with a few villages in Uganda, IIRC, where people were suffering from undernourishment. They raised goats for meat. Given the nutritional quality of goat's milk, it made sense to try to introduce it into their diets, but in their society they didn't drink goat's milk. It was a taboo. So what did the USAID team do? Mix it into a porridge. I was horrified. 

During Q&amp;A I asked him if they ever took a group's resistance to certain programs or USAID into consideration (this was around the time the GMO corn Monsanto-USAID project in Nepal was imploding). Not only did he dismiss my concern, he didn't answer my question. And you wonder why USAID is derided? And why some aid and development programs fail? What could possibly be going on here? 

So, no, STEMshits, us social science scholars are not sitting around waxing philosophical and making educated guesses. We seek the exact same thing you do, but sometimes we can't or don't want to use the same methodologies. We're not incapable.

My parents were Indian immigrants, and I was born and raised in a very white part of America. Growing up Indian, especially after 9/11, I experienced my share of stereotyping and racism, from individuals and society at large. I've heard every hilarious joke in the book - 7/11, call centers, dothead, cow worship, many-armed gods, etc. My history classes in middle school and some of high school taught me that the country my mother came from was a place of superstition, poverty, disease, backwardness, oppression, and caste system, caste system, caste system.

In addition to the outright racism is the constant feeling of alienation. I am in many ways a foreigner in my own country. Each time I hear ""where are you really from?"" it's an implicit affirmation of the fact that I will never be fully American.

I identify as Indian because it's who I am, but also because it's how others identify me. My ethnicity is part of my identity, and it's something I've had to defend my whole life, something I've had to develop pride in rather than shame.

To me, appropriation isn't just enjoying Indian food or music or film. It's claiming aspects of Indian culture as your own, it's indiscriminate theft of poorly-understood aspects of Hinduism and Indian culture. It's the fact that yoga, a multifaceted idea with profound connections to Hindu spiritualism, is now a hip exercise craze for rich urban whites. ""Yoga"", the subject of the Gita itself, is now a word for tight-fitting spandex pants. Appropriation is every deluded hippie who waxes philosophical about their ""third eye"" or Kali worship or Tantric sex (the only thing whites can associate Tantric philosophy with), it's Julia Roberts turning an entire country, people, and religion into a quick stop on her way out of an existential crisis.

Appropriation is a way of saying ""this is not yours"". It is an assault on my identity because it means not only can white America demonize and ridicule my heritage, they can take what they like from it and make it their own, destroying and distorting the original in the process. Whites surrounding themselves with a mishmash of Indian symbols and artifacts and Hindu ideas haphazardly lifted from some New Age book make a mockery out of an identity that is very real to me.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_usxyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/usxyo/a_personal_perspective_on_cultural_appropriation/,
1332233014.0,71,self.SRSDiscussion,r4uq0,Welcome to the Pine Ridge Indian reservation. Effortpostin within.,eugenevictordebs,80,9,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/r4uq0/welcome_to_the_pine_ridge_indian_reservation/,"The Pine Ridge Indian reservation is located in South-West South Dakota. It borders the state of Nebraska on the south, and is roughly the size of Deleware and Rhode Island combined. It has a population of 28,787, most of them Lakota Sioux. It is known as ""The Rez"" to it's residents. 

That is, however, about all the good you can say about it.

The Pine Ridge Reservation is quite possibly the most disgusting and inhumane abuse of human beings in the entire first world, it is indicative of the continued racism and dangerous apathy that pervades this nation, even reaching to the highest seats of power.

Pine Ridge has a 80% unemployment rate, with at least half of all families living well below the poverty line. As many as 45% have no electricity, running water, sewer or heat, relying on wood burning stoves (Which often have to burn furniture, tires and anything else flammable the families can get a hold of) to survive the brutal South Dakota winters. The per capita income is roughly $3600 per year. Pine Ridge has the lowest life expectancy, 44 for men/ 47 for women, of any area in the entire industrialized world. This number is lower than even Somalia. Diseases such as polio are still present, and cancer is now at epidemic rates due to toxic groundwater. The infant mortality rate is 300% the US average, and those that do survive face a grim childhood, with adolescent suicide 6 times higher than the national average. Diabetes is the largest killer, followed by alcohol related deaths (Mostly car accidents), exposure, and alcohol poisoning. All this despite alcohol being illegal on the rez. The law on the rez is very odd with lots of loopholes, worthless, underfunded and corrupt enforcement, which leads to rates of crime and violence being very high. Many violent criminals are released simply because they cannot be given a speedy trial in the underfunded, overworked justice system. There is an average of 17 people living in each home, and the average home has 2 rooms.

Hospitals are few and far between, with sporadic, at best, ambulance services, so many natives die of easily treated conditions. The IMS (Indian Medical Service) spends $2100 per patient, per year. To put that into perspective, Medicare pays $8000 and Medicade pays $4200. It is estimated that the reservation system is worse than that of Afghanistan.

The tribal councils are incredibly corrupt and operate off a spoils system, with people elected to office simply giving all positions to their friends and family as the loot the tribe's funds for as long as they can. Only 1 in 90 Natives actually vote anyway, with most of them incapable of reaching the far flung polling places. A recent attempt by the South Dakota Democratic Party to mobilize, register and make sure that Natives voted was greeted by violent assaults from rednecks, vandalism and police harassment.

The reservation lacks any real economic opportunities, which are the root cause of most of the problems. An example of this would be the economic ""production"" of the rez. Despite the land being set aside for the Natives, the state of South Dakota has allowed white farmers to buy or lease much of the best land, meaning that of the $33 million worth of agricultural production occurring on the rez, less than 1/3rd will ever find it's way into the hands of any member of the tribe. A large problem is, that although the rez has decent farmland, they could not, even if they had the money and resources to run an operation, sell their own crops. In order for a crop to be sold commercially, it must be inspected by the USDA.

The USDA, however, flatly refuses to inspect any crops produced by a member of the tribe, citing some obscure tribal law or another.

This system forces any Natives who wish to farm their own land to sell their land and go to work for a white farmer. Sharecropping is still alive and well on the rez.

To add insult to injury, the state allows, if not encourages, stealing the rez's water, most of which is pumped off to irrigate the farms of white farmers or to white communities elsewhere in the state.

The rez has tried, at various times, a Moccasin factory, meat packing plant and fish hook factory. 

All of these enterprises were shot down by the federal government, who has basically made it impossible for Native produced goods to be sold outside the rez with a bizarre tax and customs system. The only successful venture is the Prairie Wind Casino, which, despite ""making money"" (Most of which is pocketed by corrupt officials) is as much harm to the tribe as it is good, sucking many Natives even further into the spiral of debt, alcoholism and despair.

The Natives have risen up in the past, however. It really began with the American Indian Movement. Founded in 1968, they initially followed the teachings of such men as Martin Luther King and Gandhi, sticking to peaceful, albeit aggressive, protest. They understood that working within the American political system was worthless, and engaged in a campaign almost similar to that of the Yippies, boisterously seeking publicity wherever it could be gained. One of their earliest actions was seizing a replica of the Mayflower, followed by occupying Mount Rushmore.

As is to be expected, this did not work. They changed their tactics, and became more aggressive and radical. In 1971, they partook in their first real violent action, seizing the Bureau Of Indian Affairs HQ in Washington, DC. Seeing this, the Federal government became terrified and ramped up it's well known COINTELPRO to stop these filthy natives from achieving equal rights

In 1973, the AIM ramped it up even further, with as many as 1200 natives taking up arms to depose Dick Wilson, a teapot dictator set up by the Feds. Not only was he a prolific embezzler of tribal funds and unelected, but he went so far as to set up death squads called GOON (Guardians Of the Oglala Nation) which regularly engaged in robbery, rape, murder and extortion. He had specific orders from the fedral government to engage in ""paramilitary activities"" to destroy the AIM.

The AIM seized the town of Wounded Knee, and within the same day (Probably thanks to intel from the many infiltrators) the FBI, US Marshals, state police and army had surrounded the town.

The AIM held out for 71 days, engaged in sporadic firefights with the federal forces. Despite the Federal forces having attack helicopters, APCs, assault rifles, snipers and explosives, they never broke the stalemate with the AIM. The Feds at first attempted to starve out the AIM, but thanks to successful smuggling operations directed by the community, this tactic was not successful. The siege eventually reached a peaceful conclusion, however 2 FBI agents were killed and a US Marshal was paralyzed in the firefights. 2 Lakotas were killed, both being shot in the head as they slept.

Terrified, COINTELPRO escalated things further, supplying the GOONs with military grade weapons and training. During this time, all out war broke out on the reservation, with Pine Ridge having a murder rate of 170 per 100,000, 7 times that of Detroit. Most of the deaths were the government sponsored death squads killing AIM members and government opponents. It got to the point where even FBI agents were assisting in the killing, as was evidenced by another incident, the 1975 ""Pine Ridge Shootout"" where Federal agents attacked AIM activists.

The AIM activists fired back, killing 2 FBI men. The killers spent some time on the FBI's top 10 most wanted fugitives list, and were eventually caught.

However, due to the federal attempt to fabricate evidence to make the AIM seem like they were in the wrong, 2 of the 3 shooters were acquitted. The third, Leonard Peltier, was found guilty, thanks to a racist judge not allowing in the evidence that acquitted the other two men. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he remains to this day.

Already weakened, the final blow was dealt to the AIM in 1976, when Anna Mae Aquash, a Lakota woman and prominent AIM activist, was murdered. The Federal Government initially attempted to cover it up, stating that Ana Mae had died of exposure and refusing to identify her, instead saying she was a Jane Doe. It was not until 8 days after her burial that the AIM was able to exert enough pressure to get a second autopsy, which found out who she was and that she was shot, execution style, in the back of the head. Despite one of his bodyguards planning the murder, providing the weapon and possibly even pulling the trigger, Russell Means has never faced any charges, nor has he ever been called to testify.

After this murder, the AIM was never really active again, being reduced to a splintered, largely ineffective group.

On a thread quite some time ago, I read a trans person's account of how society seeing her as her true gender changed her experience and made her realize privileges she'd had before and never noticed. I think that trans people who have transitioned or present as their true gender rather than the one they were assigned at birth are in a unique position to comment on privilege.

So what I would like to know is: When you began to express your gender, what changes did you notice in how society treated you, relating to your gender?  What things were easier or more difficult when society perceived you as the gender you identify as?

I don't know if my question is clear or if my wording is correct (if something sounds wrong/offensive, PLEASE tell me how I should edit it!), but I just thought this might be a really enlightening discussion about gender privilege if we can get anecdata from people of various genders (including non-normative ones).  

Obviously not all trans people fit into this mold, but I welcome any and all experiences of those who noticed shifts in how they were treated by society when they changed how they presented their gender.  Of course, you only have to contribute if you are comfortable sharing your experience, and I expect everyone to conduct themselves respectfully.

As moderators, we've seen some confusion over the purpose of this subreddit, some from SRSters who thought it would be best to direct shitposters from Prime here, to others who have used this space to vent rather than discuss. To clarify, the rules of SRSDiscussion stay the same fundamentally. You're still expected to participate in good faith, and you still need a firm grasp of social justice principles outlined in the required reading (now conveniently in our wiki!), which is a prerequisite for participating in this sub. You should not circlejerk, and you should offer substance to your contributions to foster discussion.

What will change will be moderator participation--expect to see more active moderating, particularly enforcement of Rule I, II, and V. We haven't always been on the same page, but we are working on coordinating our warning, removal, and banning system to present more transparency for users. **To better support us, we want to ask users to refrain from commenting on moderation policies and rules themselves.** If you do see content that does not belong in SRSD, please report it and send a modmail to us, or if you feel up to educating, leave them a link to the appropriate 101 required reading article. Please do not accuse users of being trolls or posting in bad faith.

With the rising popularity of the sub, we've also noticed a rise in trolls, as well as posters in good faith who, for whatever reason, haven't done the required reading.To better serve the latter population while preventing their well-intentioned but often basic-level questions from overwhelming the progressive atmosphere at /r/SRSDiscussion, we've created /r/socialjustice101. We're specifically catering this space to be supportive to people who are not familiar, but would like to be more informed, on social justice issues. If the sidebar interests you, we would love subscribers here to participate as learners and educators.

**Content you would usually find in /r/SRSDiscussion that would fit better in /r/socialjustice101:**

* ""I just discovered I'm privileged/I'm just now noticing how shitty everything is - what do I do? How do I be a better ally?""
* ""Is X (being a common, frequently observed phenomenon) problematic?""
* ""I find I disagree with this particular social justice stance; can someone help me unpack why?""
* Your comment or thread was removed for derailing a thread or for violating a rule in SRSD, and you don't understand why
* Anything 101-level that would be answered by the required reading or resource compilation, but might need some clarification, ie drunken consent

**/r/SRSDiscussion should still be used for the following:**

* Questions on why something got posted to SRS, unless it's truly 101-level
* Higher level questions/discussions on social justice issues
* Seeking feedback from community on best strategies for social justice activism, or engagement on social justice issues

The basic situation was that there was a young man who would occasionally do things that required my correction, like every other kid in existence. I don't get angry or yell or shame my kids; I rely heavily on the Teacher Look and other subtler techniques and strive to avoid placing my students in embarrassing situations. As a result my classroom is usually very low-conflict, so it really threw me off guard when this young man started responding to my corrections with statements like ""you're just doing this because I'm black,"" and I don't feel like I handled it well. 

I know that the first step in responding to a comment like that is to make sure that I'm not in actual fact doing [x] just because the student is a POC, and I don't think that I was, though I realize that my own assessment might be unreliable. After this student said that the first time I became concerned that I might be disproportionately reprimanding my minority students, so I printed out an extra attendance sheet and made a tick mark next to each student's name whenever I corrected their behavior instead of just keeping track in my head. That didn't reveal any obvious patterns, but I realize that the actual act of monitoring myself may have changed my behavior.

I asked some other teachers how I should deal with this, and the least problematic advice that I got was to just ignore it since it's just something that kids say to throw you off/get their way. Obviously that is shitty advice, and it also goes against my entire teaching philosophy, particularly the part where I believe that children are people. It also occurs to me that even if it *had* been the case that he didn't actually feel discriminated against, it could still be damaging for me to behave as if his accusation wasn't worth taking seriously..

What I did the first time and ended up continuing to do when it came up in the future (three or four times, total) was telling him that I didn't want him to feel that way, and that if he wanted to discuss it with me at a more appropriate time (i.e. not in the middle of class), he could, but I feel like this was an inadequate response. For one thing, I think that ""we'll talk about it later"" is so encoded as a way that adults dismiss children that getting a kid to believe you mean it sincerely is difficult. For two things, even I as a pretty privileged adult have a great deal of trouble confronting my professors about situations that are much less charged than race relations, so the mere fact that this student never discussed the issue with me further doesn't mean he wasn't still bothered by it

After some easy googling, I found it in Google's webcache.

[Here is the link:](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:l5aDmiOUjVAJ:cherryblossomlife.com/2013/02/01/are-men-aware-of-their-condition/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us)

As a black man reading this article restating my innate criminality and violence, but this time from a different angle pretty much made my blood boil.

&gt; I would like to express how the knowledge of men being innately violent + a mutation has affected me in my everyday life. I knew that male violence was related to male biology for a year 1/2 maybe? (in that only men could be violent in that way and create a patriarchy) but when I read Sonia Johnson’s book where she explained how men were a mutation, this changed my sentiment to men.At first I was really happy to find this out because it made complete sense, in many ways (too long to explain though). It comforted me in ignoring men and acting as if only women existed, and focusing on creating safe women-only spaces.  But something I never felt before, I started to feel sorrow for their state.  It annoys me because I have never felt sorry for men before, only contempt, or ignorance at best.  I look at them and I imagine what it would be like, knowing somewhere, deep down, that you are flawed, a mistake, and that your are dead, or not fully human, or inherently destructive, and if I knew that, I would probably kill myself. To imagine feeling this made me feel sorry. Do they know it? Or do they not fully understand it? All these efforts in making women believe we are aliens, non-human, naturally and internally flawed, walking defects =&gt; this is them projecting on us. They must know on some level they are flawed, but do they experience emotional pain from it? Do they feel emotions at all, or do they just pretend to? To which extent? Are they aware of their condition somehow?

&gt;The thing is, if I treat them as mutants, what’s stopping us from killing them? Empathy? Fear? Fear of hurting ourselves, or that it will destroy our soul to do so, because being violent to someone means cutting yourself from emotions, therefore being more dead inside? Would it be bad to kill them all? To what degree does violence affect them or not? Can they only be affected by violence, and nothing else? Do they only understand violence? How does this affect our actions and decisions to take power away from them?

What the fuck is this shit? This is literally nineteenth century racist psuedoscience regurgitated. I would expect to hear this pouring from Himmler's mouth about the Jews, or from Stephen Douglas on Blacks. I'd expect to hear this from the Young Turks on Kurds. Is THIS what radfem is about? Because that's what she and her commenters and stuff self-describe as. So I'm some emotionless alien, filled with self-pity and violence?

I just finished reading this book and it's difficult for me to wrap my head around this issue completely.  I read it at the same time as ""Delusions of Gender"" so that tended to complicate things even more.

For those who haven't heard of the book, ""Female Chauvinist Pigs:  Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture"", is a book written by Ariel Levy in 2005, which essentially critiques what she sees as the modern feminist movement's embrace of ""the old objectification.""  What she seems to mean by this is activities such as stripping, amatuer porn, constantly trying to look ""hot"" etc.  She rejects the argument that these things are ""empowering"", and instead tends to seem them as merely internalizing male gaze.  
She's especially concerned about the effect this has on younger generations, and spends a considerable amount of time dealing with what she perceives to be a disconnect between sex and pleasure for adolescent females.  Levy's observations seem to suggest that instead of being given the opportunity to explore their sexuality, young girls face societal pressure to be exhibitionists, and that sexuality is increasingly becoming a sort of pseudo-popularity contest for girls that has nothing to do with their -own- pleasure.  She blames this on the idea that sexuality for females is about performance rather than pleasure; which is perpetuated in what she sees as a hyper-sexualized media.
It's worth pointing out that she's fine with ""raunch""; what she objects to is its narrow confines -defining- female sexuality.  Levy see's the sexuality in the media, in porn, and in public society today to be ""artificial"", something that does not ""exist in nature"". 

Anyways, apologies if that summary is bad.  This is an issue that has very much been bothering me for a while. When I watch ads on television, or see things like the ""lingerie football league"" being completely commonplace,  or when I see the trends in modern female fashion , I constantly find myself wondering how much of what I am seeing is influenced by patriarchal norms of objectification.  On the other hand, I worry that I am sub-consciously passing judgement on these women that I obviously have no right to.

Let me know what you think.,emshlaf,91,24,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/zsqgq/i_tried_submitting_this_to_rfunny_naturally_they/,"Hey Reddit.

We need to have a talk.

I absolutely love you, Reddit. You are unmatchable to any other website out there.
I’ve spent hours adoring the baby animals in r/aww, laughing at stoner comics in r/trees and reading intriguing stories in r/AskReddit. Reddit is a great, great website. The format is good, the discussions are good, and the content is good… well, sometimes.

A few months back I was browsing r/funny, I noticed this post had made the [front page.](http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/5e/33/5e3368_3652728.jpg)

The top-rated comments in the thread seemed to mostly agree with what was said here, with most people concurring that there are indeed “no girls on the Internet.”

Please, if you would, allow me to dissect this argument piece by piece.

&gt;“In real life, people like you for being a girl. They want to fuck you--”

I’m gonna go ahead and stop you right there.

“Being liked” is absolutely *NOT* the same thing as a bunch of horny men wanting to put their penises inside of you. When you like someone, you legitimately admire and respect who they are as a person. When you want to fuck someone … well, you want to fuck them. Let’s be honest; you could probably determine whether or not you want to fuck someone upon first or second glance. Determining whether or not you actually enjoy someone’s company takes a bit longer. Which brings me to my next point:

&gt;“…they pay attention to you and pretend what you have to say is clever or interesting, or that you are smart or clever.”

This is, quite possibly, the single most anti-woman piece of rhetoric I have ever read. The author of this post is literally saying that *all women* lack intelligence, or “cleverness.” Yup. Literally all women. Women are just dumb, vapid bodies made of tits and vaginas for men to gawk at. But surely you wouldn’t go as far as to say that women are only good for sex, *right?*

&gt;“On the Internet, we don’t have the chance to fuck you.”

Oh.

&gt;“This means the advantage of ‘being a girl’ does not exist. You don’t get a bonus to the conversation just because I’d like to put my cock in you.”

How exactly is a man wanting to put his cock in me a “bonus to the conversation?” Who is this benefitting, exactly? It’s usually pretty obvious when a man has ulterior motives with a woman. And it is *extremely fucking uncomfortable.*

When you, a man, walk down a busy street and notice men’s faces; what do you see? How do they perceive you? You probably get a lot of blank stares, maybe a smile or a wave here or there, but for the most part you are just one of many faces.

Now when you, a woman, walk down a busy street and notice men’s faces – the perception is much different. You see men you don’t even know eyeing you up and down. Making lewd remarks or catcalls, even if you are walking hand-in-hand with your husband. If your shorts are just a little too short or your shirt is just a little too low, you are immediately prone to a barrage of derogatory and degrading remarks. (And that’s some of the least harmful stuff that can happen.)

We just went over how, according to this poster, all women are mindless, uninteresting piles of flesh intended solely for the male genitalia. Women experience this first hand every single day. But hey, thank you for completely validating all of the uneasiness that women feel around strange men.

&gt;“When you make a post like ‘hurr durr, I’m a girl’ you are begging for attention.” 

The only time I have ever felt compelled to indicate my gender is when someone mistakenly refers to me as a man. Do you know why I correct them? Because *they were wrong!* They made the mistake; not me. If a man were mistakenly referred to as a woman online, chances are he would not be accused of “begging for attention” when he corrected them. And honestly, what kind of “attention” do you think women are “begging” for, exactly? Hundreds of orange envelopes filled with requests for nude photos? I’ll go ahead and rename that from “begging for attention” to “correcting someone’s mistake and receiving unwanted, perverse and degrading marks in return.”


And even if a woman indicates her gender in a non-correcting manner: *so what???* Women comprise half this planet. Chances are, you’re going to run into a few of them online. Notice that this isn’t even an issue when the genders are flipped. No man, anywhere, ever, has ever been accused of mentioning his gender for the “attention.” 

&gt;“The only reason to post it is because you want your girl-advantage back, because you are to stupid to do or say anything interesting without it.”

Aaaaannnd we’re back on the whole “all women are stupid” thing. Fantastic!

	&gt;“You are forgetting the rules, there are no girls on the Internet.”

There sure as hell won’t be if these types of posts continue.

&gt;“The one exception to this rule, the one way you can get your ‘girliness’ back on the Internet, is to post your tits.”

…Women *have* to post their tits? One of the most private parts of their entire body, and you are pressuring them to show them off to the entire world just for mentioning that they are female? What on earth does this accomplish besides completely degrading a woman and reducing her to her naked body?

&gt;“This is, and should be, degrading for you, an admission that the only interesting thing about you is your naked body.”

Wow. You said it yourself. I guess it doesn’t accomplish anything at all except *making a random woman feel like total and complete shit.*

In one post, this user has managed to reduce women to their sexual organs, call them all dumb, vapid and uninteresting, completely undermine the fact that all women do not enjoy being hit on by strangers, and pushed the ever-hateful stigma that the Internet is strictly a boys’ club, and that if women dare venture into the mens’ lair, they had better show off one of the most intimate areas of their bodies, or shut up, lay low and act like one of the dudes.

*And most of you agreed with it.*

I am not posting this for a discussion. I am not posting this for karma. I am not posting this for any other reason than to tell you this:

It is this type of sexist, hateful message that makes the Internet a “boys’ club” to begin with.

I don't particularly agree with the linked quote, nor necessarily think it shouldn't be in SRS. What I find problematic is some of the comments from SRSters, which seem to me to come dangerously close to an automatic lionisation and glamourisation of the military and military service. I've always thought the automatic respect accorded to soldiers was a huge problem in the UK (and from observation in the US and other countries); this respect is fine if you're looking at it in the sense of people who have bravely endured a lot of terrible shit, however, it seems to often serve to insulate the military from any criticism. I also find it telling that, for example, coal miners and deep sea fisherfolk aren't accorded anything like the same level of widespread respect, despite enduring comparable hardships and risks. The armed forces are massively oppressive institutions, both towards their own soldiers and towards the civilians of other countries, and their own. I know recruiters are often coercive and duplicitous, but I do think, on some level, that people who serve in the military should expect some criticism for upholding these institutions. I also find it very difficult not to view many of the actions of soldiers as ethical, or to believe that the people carrying them out can be completely good people. Soldiers are trained and conditioned to perform unethical actions, but to what extent can soldiers be held accountable for participating in their own training? As an anarchist, I don't believe in the legitimacy of the state, so to me, a soldier who kills a civilian is a murderer. Should the fact that soldiers volunteer, or are co-erced, in to a dangerous job somehow protect them from these ethical judgements? To what degree does their co-ercion (if it does take place) remove their capacity to make an ethical choice.

I have lurked SRSPrime for some time now and really enjoy and appreciate an atmosphere of unrepressed mocking of the toxic unexamined privilege that is so damn common on Reddit. 

Which is why I was really upset to see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/wp99h/1steffort_jews_worse_than_hitler_according_to/) hit the frontpage today. I searched SRSD for information about how the Palestinian situation is usually approached within the Fempire, and it seems that there really isn't much of a group consensus on it. While I realize that SRS is mostly concerned with misogyny, white privilege, homophobia, and transphobia, which are the main ways shitlordism expresses itself on Reddit, it seems really incongruous to me to see opposition to settler colonialism called out as poop. When the general purpose of the Fempire seems to be calling out and addressing issues of marginalization and oppression, it's odd to see the anti-Zionist opinions that sometimes show up on Reddit called out as if they were equally shitty as the hatred for women, PoC, trans* folk, and GSM that crops up like turdweeds all the time. 

Granted, the thread that u/SRSly_fantastic called out did have some people expressing views that were borderline offensive. But I really, really can't jerk over [""As a Jew, fuck these guys. Also please try and keep the anti-semetic comments to a minimum. There are assholes everywhere, no one's claiming Jewish people are an exception.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wp10x/settlers_make_fun_of_the_palestinian_woman_after/c5f7rbe). I think it's really important for people of Jewish background (myself included!) to call out Zionism for what it is. I have avoided posting what-I-see-as-poop relating to the I/P conflict precisely because I think that other people might not agree that it's poop and that it's important to keep SRSPrime united against the important issues (aforementioned misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, racism, etc). That said, I think it's pretty shitty to see a photo of a bunch of SAWCSMs gloating over literally forcing a woman of color out of her house at gunpoint and immediately call out Reddit for getting upset about it. There is a serious power differential in the occupied territories and it seems to be that the job of folks concerned with social justice is not to be tearing down people for sympathizing with the subaltern - even if they're getting carried away with it - but rather trying to use this anti-colonial sentiment as a teaching point for awareness of subaltern issues as a whole, and how they tie into misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, racism, and other issues relating to oppressed and marginalized people.

I'm interested in what other people think about this issue and how it should be approached within SRSPrime and the Fempire at large. Should people be siding with the Palestinians? Should we avoid posting poop related to the conflict in any way? What do you think? Does anyone else feel uncomfortable seeing posts like this on SRSPrime?

1361957501.0,61,self.SRSDiscussion,19bie7,Can we talk about how to use trigger warnings effectively?,srs_anon,74,13,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/19bie7/can_we_talk_about_how_to_use_trigger_warnings/,"I've noticed a trend towards using [TW] on posts that merely mention things like rape, sexual assault, racism, fatphobia, and so on. I certainly don't fault anyone for overusing TWs, but I think they do so out of confusion about what TWs are for, so I'd like to hear your perspectives on how TWs can serve you personally.

Some questions for people who suffer from some issue/oppression that TWs are used for:

- What does being 'triggered' mean for you? (For some people, it means having a PTSD flashback, while for others, it seems to mean being deeply emotionally hurt. There are probably a lot of other responses subsumed under the label 'trigger' as well.)
- What kind of content do you want TWs on?
- When you see that a post is marked with a TW, do you avoid reading it?
- Are TWs useful to you in some other way? For instance, do they allow you to mentally prepare yourself for triggering content?
- Do you see TWs being used in SRS subs where they're unnecessary, or not being used where they are necessary?

I'm a PTSD sufferer as a result of rape and sometimes really graphic descriptions of rape can trigger me into having panic attacks/flashbacks. (This is rare for me, at least now, but there was a time when it happened quite frequently.) However, I almost never avoid content with TWs on it because I feel that the meaning of 'TW' has been so far diluted that it's not really a valid indicator of whether triggering content will appear.

As I've said above, I don't fault anyone for this, and I think people are just trying to be on the 'safe' side and don't understand that using TWs too freely can also be troublesome for the people who need them. That's why I'd like to talk about what people who need TWs for various issues - in order to give people who DON'T need them a better idea of what kind of content should be marked with a TW.

Another thing I'd like to address is that a generic TW isn't really going to be very helpful, unless it's clear from context what sort of triggering content the post will contain. I think there was a time when TWs were used almost exclusively for sexual assault, but now they're used for all sorts of content. I think it's best to include a short description of what sort of triggering content will be found, e.g. [TW: racism] or [TW: self-injury], so that people who need TWs for a certain kind of content don't feel the need to avoid ALL potentially-triggering content.

And one last thing I wonder about is whether, in some cases, the phrase ""content warning"" might be more appropriate than ""trigger warning"" - depending on how you feel about what 'triggering' means. I'm not sure how others read the phrase ""content warning"" and would be curious to know. My feeling is that 'triggering' means to trigger a psychological response like a panic attack or PTSD flashback, but I know others are using this word differently. A ""content warning"" can perhaps be used more generically to warn readers about content that might be upsetting or disturbing, but not necessarily 'triggering.'",,False,,t5_2t5sa,1361962644.0,,,True,t3_19bie7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/19bie7/can_we_talk_about_how_to_use_trigger_warnings/,

&gt; This weekend I read an article in Bitch magazine about Project Unbreakable. Last fall, then 19-year-old Grace Brown began photographing survivors of sexual assault holding posters with quotes from their attackers (or, in some cases, the police or others they told about the attack). It’s a powerful art project that highlights the emotional manipulation (“I love you,” or “If you tell your mom she’ll hate you for causing us to break up”) that often accompanies rape and sexual abuse. I’m only posting a few here, but collectively they illustrate many of the justifications perpetrators give. The quotes chosen by the survivors also make clear that the demands to keep the incident secret and the efforts of abusers to justify their behavior are as much a part of the attack as the physical element.

So yeah, it's some truly intense and heartbreaking/anger-inducing stuff. If you want to check Project Unbreakable out, [here's a link to the site](http://projectunbreakable.tumblr.com).

One thing that really popped out for me is just how many of these quotes are eerily similar to the narratives we see frustrated Redditors construct about women, often supposedly in jest. Whether it's the invalidation of women's feelings or ""ruining them for other men"", it's all things we've seen expressed over and over again on Reddit.

And to make things worse, there is a massive echo chamber on Reddit that supports and normalizes these narratives to the point where the only thing that's truly objectionable in all of this is when people call out these toxic narratives about women.

What do y'all think? While the real world has so many issues with rape culture, it's kind of terrifying how magnified it all is when all these dudes can suddenly hide behind anonymity and really let us know what they think.

I know this is all very obvious, but I found this project to be really amazing in showing how sexual assault is so much more than just violence (and how therapeutic it can be for survivors to write it all out) and I'd love to hear people's thoughts on it.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,1340127651.0,,,True,t3_va9rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/va9rz/tw_project_unbreakable_and_just_how_closely_it/,

In doing so they are conflating two completely different actions:

 * **Censorship** - An entity, private or public, acts to quash the publication of speech.
 * **Editorial discretion** - An entity, public or private, acts to not publish some speech.

There's a difference. What Reddit is doing is not censorship. They are not preventing other people from publishing jailbait. They are engaging in editorial discretion and refusing to publish jailbait under the Reddit name. The difference is that censorship restricts the **negative right to speech**, and editorial discretion restricts the **positive right to be heard**.

All rights come packaged with them the responsibility of another party to do something to ensure that right exists. A negative right requires that others stop themselves *from* doing something, while positive rights require that some other party *do* something to provide you with that right. Positive and negative versions of a right have different qualities and can sometimes even interfere with each other.

What most people seem to mistakenly think is that the first amendment is somehow a positive right to be heard. No, no it is not. It is a negative right to speak and not speak. If people had a positive right to be heard, then someone else would have to publish their words and that would violate their negative right to not speak.

Reddit is exercising their negative right not to speak. They have no obligation to publish anything. In fact I would argue that Reddit has erred too long on the side of not exercising this right. They should have used their editorial discretion a long time ago on these very subreddits. They already use editorial discretion on personal information. What many of these jailbait subreddits have been trading around is tantamount to personal information in the first place, so really it's not even a change of policy so much as it is a clarification of already existing policy.

Dear reader, let us start with an exercise.

Think of the first movie or character that comes to mind for each of these questions or statements. Don't worry too much about it- whatever comes to mind first, even (especially!) if it's “fucked if I know.” Should only take you a minute to do all of this.

Note: Western movies only here, the answers are obviously a lot easier if you include, say, Hong Kong or Tokyo Cinema.

1. Think of the last movie you saw or heard about where an Asian man has an on-screen romance with someone.
	
 A. Last movie where they kissed

 B. Last movie with a sex scene

 C. Last movie where the other person wasn't Asian

2. Now do the same for an Asian woman- Except, replace 1C with “WAS Asian.”

3. Think of the last movie that had an Asian lead that did not in any way involve martial arts. 

 A. Yes, gun-fu counts, nice try

Done? I'm willing to bet you have a lot of blank spots- and if you're anything like me, half of your answers are “Harold and Kumar.”

Next question is obvious: Why the exercise? What does all of this mean?

We'll get back to that later. For now, just keep it in mind while I talk about the first and foremost problem with the portrayal of Asians in media- the removal or corruption of portrayals by whitewashing. Whitewashing, for anyone who is unaware, is the process by which roles that are obviously Asian or in general non-white are changed into roles for white actors and actresses.

---

The easy example here is the infamously shitty movie adaptation of Avatar, The Last Airbender. Let's demonstrate with a series of pictures!



[http://i.imgur.com/YqaZz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YqaZz.jpg)

This is the female lead of the series, Katara. She's pretty cool- as you may be able to tell by her garb, her background is Inuit inspired. Pretty clearly a Native American or Native Asian role.

[http://imgur.com/EeOzO.jpg](http://imgur.com/EeOzO.jpg)

This is her brother, Sokka. Same idea.

Now, let's see what they look like in the movie.

[http://i.imgur.com/IPcGV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IPcGV.jpg)

[http://i.imgur.com/9xyZC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9xyZC.jpg)

...Oh. Well then.

What about our erstwhile hero, Aang?

[http://i.imgur.com/fXRlH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fXRlH.jpg)

As you can tell by his color scheme and lack of hair, Aang is based on something between a Tibetan monk and a Shaolin monk. Either way, pretty clearly an Asian role, right? Let's see his movie version.

[http://i.imgur.com/3A1Ru.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3A1Ru.jpg)

...Well, that's a bit of a trend. You can argue it's not as egregious as the previous two, but still.

What about our conflicted antagonist, the driven and angry Prince Zuko?

[http://i.imgur.com/DnHS5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DnHS5.jpg)

His aesthetic is pretty clearly based on the Qin Dyntasy of China- if you've ever seen pictures or been lucky enough to visit the famous Terracotta Soldiers at the tomb of Qin Shi Huang Di, you can see the resemblance in his armor. Let's see who they tried to cast as him originally.

[http://i.imgur.com/IWT8m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IWT8m.jpg)

Wait, wait! Luckily ex-Bieber Jesse McCartney was forced to drop out due to other commitments, and we got an actually Asian replacement! Amazing!

[http://i.imgur.com/Tz6UJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Tz6UJ.jpg)


...hang on a second here. Something is bugging me about this.

Oh, luckily enough some kind folks have bashed together something already to explain what it is.

[http://i.imgur.com/5V07H.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5V07H.jpg)

Funny how that works out, isn't it.

---

So Hollywood managed to take a series about Asians fighting other Asians in fantasy Asia, and turn it into white people fighting brown people, by whitewashing roles in a way that removes positive Asian roles and corrupts the narrative, making them only the villains. This is an example of what is referred to in identity politics parlance as “Otherization,” something that has plagued all minorities- the ideation of members of a group as monolithic “others” who can be distrusted and cannot be portrayed except as stereotypes. It is a fundamental dehumanization of the group being otherized.

This is why whitewashing is so harmful: it removes from the public consciousness a portrayal of this “other” group as a human being similar to them, and in many cases replaces it with yet another portrayal of them as little more than a stereotype. Not only does this lead to mistreatment of minorities in person, it can lead to far, far darker things. When European powers were pillaging, raping, and murdering their imperialist way across the Middle East and the rest of Asia, they justified it with a larger scale form of otherization which is now referred to as “Orientalism”- a belief that Asian cultures were fundamentally similar to each other, and fundamentally different from European cultures in a way that meant nothing was possible except conquest and conversion. The echoes of this attitude are still with us to this day- many stereotypes of Asians of all stripes stem from orientalist views, and anti-immigrant backlash against Asians is often heavily based in an idea that the culture they bring with them is just too different for things to work. When you hear someone rail against those dirty foreigners, you're hearing the centuries old voice of Orientalism roaring from a new mouth.

For further examples of whitewashing in modern Hollywood, consider that there is an Akira (yes, the anime) movie being made- with no Asian actors whatsoever apparently involved. For a movie that has already been released, the movie 21 portrays a primarly white group of students where the original group was majority Asian- the Asians in the movie are relegated to a pair of token nerds.

---

Now that we've laid some basic groundwork, back to the questions. Why are they important?

Each question illustrates a brick in the otherization wall for the portrayal of Asians in the media- a stereotype or tendency that contributes to the idea that Asians are different and abnormal. The first lesson of the first question is pretty obvious- Asian men are consistently portrayed as either sexless or sexually predatory.

As an illustrative example, let's look at the Jet Li movie Romeo Must Die. As you may be able to tell, said movie is a retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, with Jet Li as Romeo and, importantly, Aaliyah as Juliet. Some changes have been made, of course- both leads survive, and in the end stand together, in love and victorious... then share a hug and walk off together.

Wait, what? A Romeo and fucking Juliet retelling without as much as a kiss?

Here's the thing- a kiss scene was filmed, and then promptly removed, because test viewers found a kiss been an Asian man (Jet fucking Li, ladies and gentlemen) and a black woman too distasteful, because Asian men aren't supposed to be sexhavers. I haven't even heard of a movie where an Asian man gets to have an on-screen sex scene with anybody. 

“Well, that's just the consumers being racists” you might say. “You can't blame the studios for bowing to what their customers want.”

Yes, I fucking can. By bowing to such pressures, the studios tacitly reinforce them- in the same way that remaining silent during a racist joke allows the person to continue being a racist.

Anyway, it's not like this is a new thing. The archetypical Asian male roles in media are Martial Artist (sexless), Mentor (sexless), Sidekick (sexless), Nerd (sexless or possibly predatory in an ineffectual way), and Predatory Villain (sexual, but only in a way intended to scare white people). Asian men are not romantic leads, ever- because their sexuality is either nonexistent, constrained to a frightening or “humorous” attempt at getting “white women,” or tokenized to a equally stereotyped Asian woman. And the impact of such portrayals is pretty easy to see- why is it that Asians are the ones who are stereotyped as having small penises?

---

So that's the point of the first question. What about the second?

The second is an illustration of the way Asian women are portrayed in media. Sure, unlike Asian men they are “permitted” to be romantic and sexual... but only in a way that emphasizes their submission to men. In a way, they are stuck in the same “sexless/predatory” dichotomy as the men, as their sexuality is not used as an active expression but a passive one if they're a “good” one, or as a weapon when they're a “bad” one. The language I'm going to use here is offensive, and I'd advise against using it on any real Asian women- but the two stereotypes are most easily thought of as “exotic beauty” and “dragon lady.” 

For the purest possible example of the “exotic beauty” archetype, take a look at Memoirs of A Geisha. It's hard to sum up how awful it is without watching it, so if and when you do so, note how much action the main character (in theory) does, and how much she simply passively receives. “Good” Asian women are consistently denied agency- they are passive receivers of the actions of another. On top of that, they are fetishized as “exotic” “different” beauties, another fine example of otherization. 

The flip side of this is the “Bad” Asian woman, the Dragon Lady. She gets to be assertive and aggressive and active and many other things starting with A- in return for being “evil,” i.e. likely to be defeated, killed, or converted to “good” via a dicking- and still a secondary character to a man or white person. The absolutely defining example in the last twenty years is Ling Woo from Ally McBeal- another one that really should be experienced to be believed, but I think this description of her from an Asian-American studies professor should about sum it up: ""a neo-Orientalist masturbatory fantasy figure concocted by a white man whose job it is to satisfy the blocked needs of other white men who seek temporary escape from their banal and deadening lives by indulging themselves in a bit of visual cunnilingus while relaxing on the sofa.""

So the third question's purpose should be obvious at this point- There are almost no depictions of non-martial artist Asians of either gender as lead roles. Asians are almost without exception secondary characters, backup players to a more “American” or “British” or whatever lead. An easy example is any of the Karate Kid movies at all- note how the main character is never Asian, only the mentor. The Asian occupies a secondary position to the accomplishments of the non-Asian, always and forever. Watch some movies with Asian characters mixed with non-Asian characters, and you'll see this dynamic literally everywhere you look- The Green Hornet, The Forbidden Kingdom, Kill Bill, the list goes on and on.

Now, to the point- What should you take away from this? I know I've left a lot of gaps where I've asked you to do some of your own reading and watching and thinking- so what is it I am trying to say?

What I am trying to say is that the media tells you that Asians aren't people.

I'm not entirely sure this is the appropriate subreddit, but it looks like a good match. In case it's not, I'd be grateful if someone could point me to a better venue.

I come seeking advice. Back in late July, I accidentally found a rather heinous subreddit ([/r/hotrapestories](/trigger) ) in the output of a completely unrelated search. My first reaction was to report the subreddit in its entirety, on the basis that the mods would be unlikely to listen to my arguments if I were to report individual posts. I haven't found a clearly defined way of reporting entire subreddits, so I tried sending a message to #reddit.com then an actual email to abuse@reddit.com. I wanted to get Reddit-the-company to take notice and then take action. I imagined an end-goal where the subreddit would be deleted and the posters banned.

I never heard back from Reddit and nothing happened.

Some time later, I discussed the situation with a friend of mine who told me that short of legal action, Reddit-the-company would be unlikely to lift a finger. She's more clued in to the ways of reddit than I am and I had other things going on, so I left it at that.

It's been bothering me, though. I'm not a very active redditor at all, but since then I've become distantly aware of SRS and I think there must be people around here who have experience dealing with the nasty corners of reddit. I never spent much time there, but I checked just now and that subreddit is still around.

So, what does one do? Does Reddit-the-company ever shut down subreddits? Same friend mentioned that subreddits can be taken over. Does that happen? How? Does SRS as a collective entity know what to do?

Thanks in advance,

[Eugenics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics) is

&gt; the study of or belief in the possibility of improving the qualities of the human species or a human population, especially by such means as discouraging reproduction by persons having genetic defects or presumed to have inheritable undesirable traits (negative eugenics) or encouraging reproduction by persons presumed to have inheritable desirable traits (positive eugenics). - [Source](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eugenics)

However, eugenics was wildly popular in all Western countries in the early twentieth century. The [International Eugenics Congresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Eugenics_Conference), (1912, 1921, and 1932), were presided over by famous minds such as [Leonard Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Darwin) (that's Charles Darwin's son), [Winston Churchill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill), and [Alexander Graham Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell) (who, it turns out, was very [interested in the deaf]( http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED033502&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED033502)), and eugenics was largely considered [""the self-direction of human evolution"", which would allow humans to direct evolution via the application of a wide range of academic disciplines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eugenics_congress_logo.png). For the purposes of simplicity, I will be focusing mostly on the [American Eugenics Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States) because it so greatly informed and inspired the other eugenics programs throughout the Western world. However, it is also important to note that eugenics programs were practiced in [colonies during the Imperial era and should be considered carefully in discussion of the atrocities of colonization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics#German_colonies_in_Africa). 

**The American Eugenics Movement**

Prior to America's involvement in World War II, the United States boasted a large eugenics program. In fact, it was the American eugenics program that [provided much of the inspiration](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2003%2F11%2F09%2FING9C2QSKB1.DTL) [for the public health programs](http://books.google.com/books?id=1lvbUy441m0C&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) [of Nazi Germany](http://books.google.com.co/books?id=UGYfRv3DWuQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=eugenics+is+a+forms+of+racism&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=8sQfTpb_IKbr0gHljO3XAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eugenics%20is%20a%20forms%20of%20racism&amp;f=false). The American Eugenics Movement fostered good down-home (read: weird) American fun in the form of ""Scientific"" [Better Baby Contests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States#Better_Baby_Contests) ([examples of Better Babies](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=43&amp;search=&amp;matches=)) and [Fitter Family for the Future Contests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States#Fitter_Family_for_Future) ([examples of Fitter Families](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=8&amp;search=&amp;matches=)). However, there was a *pronounced* dark side to the eugenics movement, including [immigration restrictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924) and horrific forced sterilization and euthanization programs.

[Indiana](http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=1829) was the first state to pass a eugenics-based [forced sterilization]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization) law in 1907, with thirty other states quickly following suit. In 1927, [the Supreme Court ruled that states could](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=39&amp;search=&amp;matches=) [sterilize anyone that they judged to be unfit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell) (note: this ruling has *never* been overturned). Between 1907 and 1963, [an estimated 64,000 individuals were sterilized under eugenics sterilization laws]( http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html). The last forcible sterilization [occurred in Oregon in *1981*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170108/). As of today, those forcibly sterilized have received no apology or reparation for their suffering. 

**Feminism, Birth Control &amp; Eugenics Programs**

It is interesting to note here the connection between American eugenics programs and feminism. [Many early feminists supported a eugenics platform](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol311/211-236.pdf).  The most prominent feminist advocate of eugenics programs was [Margaret Sanger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger) ([Works](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/s#a693)), birth control advocate and creator of the wonderful, [Planned Parenthood]( http://www.plannedparenthood.org/). Sanger was a great proponent of negative eugenics programs, and sought vehemently to prevent the reproduction of persons [that she deemed to be unfit, even going so far as to state that she supported, ""coercion to prevent the ""undeniably feeble-minded"" from procreating.""](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2135230). To be fair, some argue that Sanger was merely attempting to incorporate the language of the eugenics movement into the birth control movement to capitalize on the popularity of the eugenics movement at the time. 
 
Because women bore children, they were seen as more responsible for the betterment or the detriment of the scientific fitness of the human race. Therefore, eugenics programs were [targeted mostly at them](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=33&amp;search=&amp;matches=). This meant that upper middle class and upper class white women were *denied* birth control and sterilization if they requested it, as their duty was to produce more ""fit children and ""better the human race"". Poverty, on the other hand, was seen as a sign of unfitness, so lower class women were *encouraged* to use birth control and *discouraged* from having children. Impoverished women who did not submit to a birth control program were often sterilized in order to control their sexuality and reproductive output. (Critchlow, Donald T. (1999). Intended Consequences: Birth Control, Abortion, and the Federal Government in Modern America. New York: Oxford University Press).

**The Fall and Resurgence of Eugenics Programs**

In reaction to the [unethical public health programs of the Nazi regime](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=41&amp;search=&amp;matches=), eugenics and eugenics programs fell quickly out of favor after WWII. Countries who formerly touted large, booming eugenics programs began to dismantle them quickly. However, eugenics began to enjoy a resurgence in interest in the 1980s, due to advancements in the field of genetics and genetics engineering (see [The Human Genome Project](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml)).  Richard Herrnstein's popular 1994 book, [The Bell Curve](http://books.google.com/books?id=s4CKqxi6yWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+bell+curve&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LYYPT63VHsTZtgfB2Ln1AQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20bell%20curve&amp;f=false), which argued that immigration from countries with low average IQs is undesirable, as well as the popular 2006 film, [Idiocracy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/) have also greatly popularized eugenics programs positively both in pop culture and in public consciousness, prompting some people to call for forced sterilization of those on welfare or an exam a couple would have to pass before reproducing.

 **Discussion starters**:

- Are there ways in which eugenics could be practiced ethically?

- Why would feminists in the First Wave be proponents of eugenics platforms?

- Margaret Sanger. WTF? 

- Some individuals claim that current birth control information programs actually constitute eugenics,
since they may disproportionately target people from certain socioeconomic, racial or educational
backgrounds. Do you agree with this claim?

- On the other hand, some claim that the current trend for birth rate to decrease at higher socioeconomic
levels is a problem and should be reversed, either by reducing the birth rate at the lower end or
encouraging larger families at the upper end. Are their grounds for concern that higher birth rates among
less educated or advantaged individuals could negatively impact the gene pool? Is any kind of eugenic
effort in this direction ethical?

1344451042.0,64,self.SRSDiscussion,xw7a4,Criticism of sportsmanship in male vs. female athletes,textrovert,83,19,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/xw7a4/criticism_of_sportsmanship_in_male_vs_female/,"Gymnastics is mostly what I know, so that's where I'll focus this post, but if anyone has noticed what I'm talking about in other sports, I'd be curious about that, too!

Lately, I've been mostly taking a break from The Fempire and other parts of Reddit I usually inhabit since it's Olympic time. I was a competitive gymnast for years when I was younger and still follow the sport, though most intensely around the Olympics. So I've enjoyed hanging out on /r/olympics and /r/gymnastics and talking about Yurchenkos and sheep jumps instead of the privilege and patriarchy for a while. I've thought for the most part, both communities were pretty great, but of course, eventually the Reddit creeps in. I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/xlz8x/who_cares_she_won_a_gold_medal_so_good_for_her/c5nmczw) in SRSPrime about some [racist reactions](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/xlz8x/who_cares_she_won_a_gold_medal_so_good_for_her/c5nj8np) to Gabby Douglas's historic and incredibly well-deserved all-around win, but I want to talk about gender, too.

One of the many things I love about the Olympics is that it's the one time it feels like there is genuine interest and admiration for women's sports on the same level as for men's. I loved seeing [McKayla Maroney's jaw-dropping vault](http://deadspin.com/5930714/relive-mckayla-maroneys-phenomenal-vault-in-super+slow-motion) hit the #1 spot on /r/olympics, followed by a lot more articles and posts about her (she is possibly the best vaulter in the history of the sport). At first, the ""I'd bang her"" comments about this 16-year-old girl were buried in downvotes, but they became more prevalent. People started implying she was bitchy or slutty (when would this world-class athlete and teenager have time?!), seemingly mostly based on the fact that she is a cute 16-year-old girl, and not even her behavior. 

But then, after she sat down one of her vaults at event finals (so rare for her that it's never happened in the past few years) which resulted in silver, there were [all these comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xqudj/goals/c5ot369) ridiculously critical of how she handled herself afterward. But if you watch it, she just looks shocked and like she's trying to hold it together. She gives hugs to the other girls (though she misses one, but not intentionally and said she hugged her later). She doesn't cry until she's down from the medals podium and in private, and during the ceremony a photographer catches her making [this face](http://i.imgur.com/tXVIH.jpg), which to me looks like, ""I'm disappointed in myself."" Which is exactly what she said in interviews later - that she knew she didn't deserve gold for sitting on her butt, that she is not disappointed with silver but with her performance, that she's happy for the other girls. Basically, she's a pro, especially for a teenager, but she's also human. What better could you expect? She is *by far* the best vaulter in the world, has been called the best in history, and was upset that she had screwed up when she could have easily won gold, her lifelong dream. She's *so* criticized for things we forgive easily or don't even notice or mention in men.

There was [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xrnci/coldest_point_in_the_universe/) about how when female gymnasts congratulate each other, it's obviously fake and cold. Contrast that to the reaction to the men at the high bar final, where *all* of them hit and gave incredible performances, culminating with the Netherlands' Epke Zonderland's outrageously dazzling routine. There were so [many comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xtsnv/zonderlands_golden_exercise_on_the_horizontal_bar/c5pj6ii) saying that the level of sportsmanship was [so much better than the ""females.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gymnastics/comments/xtrdh/amazing_high_bar_final_wow/) But this was an exceptional final, where everyone hit and the results were obvious! Of course they were exuberant! It's not like all men's events were like that - take just the day before, when the silver medalist on rings was immediately telling the media that the gold medalist didn't deserve it. The women have been great sports, too! No one talking about how, after Aly Raisman's gold floor routine, supposedly the biggest ""diva"" of women's gymnastics, Aliya Mustafina (who won bronze, and who narrowly edged Aly out in the all-around), gave Aly a hug and a thumbs-up for her performance (they don't speak the same language; also, now that I think about it, especially lovely and Olympic-y because it was between an American Jewish girl whose floor exercise was to ""Hava Nagila"" and a Russian Muslim girl). Or people on Reddit were racistly complaining that Gabby Douglas didn't deserve her win over Russia's Viktoria Komova *and* saying that Komova was a bad sport for crying, while Komova herself said of Gabby, 

&gt;[""She performed beautifully today, and I believe that she earned her gold medal. She was very, very good tonight….I am proud about what I've done today, but nevertheless I am a little disappointed because I wanted to gain the gold medal. Well, it didn't happen.""](http://www.thecouchgymnast.com/?p=7068)

I'm just disgusted with it. It seems to me that with men, people *only* take notice in cases of good sportsmanship, for which they are lavishly praised, and give them a break for whatever reaction they have to wins or losses. With female athletes, if they hug and congratulate each other, it's ""fake."" If they get upset after losing or a bad performance, they're ""divas."" If they're not excited enough, they're ungrateful ice queens. If they are excited despite a competitor's loss, they're insensitive bitches. What are they supposed to do? These are kids! It just seems like people go to the utmost lengths to see these girls in the worst light possible, despite their sweet actions and gracious words.

The situation pains very much and I hold a very deep hatred for her rapist. It makes me very angry when I think about it and what he did to her.

I am a small unit leader in the military and early this morning I got a call from one of my subordinates informing me that one of my soldiers had been arrested late the night before for domestic violence. Part of my job is having to sort issues like this out in a neutral and what could even be a sympathetic or apologetic way is not careful. I and another person in his chain of command went to the local court house for his arraignment but since his partner, who I had been in contact with throughout the day to ensure she felt secure in her home and had access to the family finances, declined to press charges he was released into our custody. (Btw this surprised me - I thought domestic violence cased were automatically prosecuted since an abusive relationship is also  manipulative and the victim may be too fearful or powerless to think she can get out of it.) 

I then was in the car with a violent abuser, the type of person who abused and raped my spouse and whom I hate. If I witnessed abuse I hope that I would intervene and think that I would want the abuser to feel the pain and powerlessness that his victim feels. But because of my professional position I was supposed to be neutral and continue being his leader. I explained to him the immediate and likely future  legal and administrative consequences of his actions. We even stopped and I bought him food and something to drink after he told us that he had not had anything to eat since his arrest and was afraid to drink the water in the jail. And it didn't take until after this happened for me to realize how my behavior contradicted my feelings and beliefs on abusers and rapists – I fully comprehended how I should be helping this person, how they are owed nothing. It felt weird then and it feels weird now and that means I was probably doing something wrong. Did I do this wrong? Was I acting sympathetically? I think I was. What am I supposed to do.

Yesterday, after our now seemingly usual discussion about how homosexuality is not a mental illness. After I told him for the n'teenth time about how homosexuality exists in so many species and is part of nature, as a refute to, his words: ""TabrisTheLast, I assure you, if we look into your DNA, we will see heterosexuality coded in it."" What? This is bullshit right? Does anyone here have some source which counters this? SOmething to help be believe that what he said is crap?

And that's not the half of it. After that happened, came the worst part. On the same topic on homosexuality, he told me, in a serious voice ""Tell me, what can a man offer another man (in terms of a relationship)?"" I just stood in silence, I mean, how are you supposed to answer to a married privilidged SAWSCM?. He answers: ""**NOTHING**.""

I was so shocked, so appalled by his words. I started laughing, like I was crazy, I couldn't believe my ears. This man, whom with I've shared so much with for 5+ years, my issues with my sexuality, my growth, my troubled times in high school, my private feelings, who has supported me (or so I thought) for so long, finally shows his true, ugly colors.

And it didn't stop there. WHen I yelled at him he was wrong in a somewhat angry stern voice, he said: ""Oh, you're just angry cause you know I'm right ;) you're angry because you know I'm telling you the truth."" (NO mr.psychology I-can-read-minds asshole, I'm angry because I KNOW you're wrong.) ""Woman compliments man. This is the truth TabrisTheLast, I'm the one telling you, and it's time you man up and learn it. MAN UP. Be a man. (*se hombrecito*)""

""Man.. up..""? What the fuck? What is this? WHo have I been seeing all this time? Why? He was the only one I still trusted, but now he is just like my father, to whom I'm a joke to (he jokes around with ""gay"" even though his son is gay, behind my back of course), and my mother, who again thinks I'm disgusting and a joke.. Why is it the people you love who hurt you so bad? The people I respect, have none in kind for me. Why does it have to be this way? Everything feels so hollow now, I feel so lonely. Everything, life, is such a joke.

Who is he to know what a man can offer another in a relationship? What a woman can offer another woman? WHo the hell is he to judge? Happiness, love, true love. WHY IS HIS MIND SO SMALL?? Someone who went through medical school and has seen so many patients, why?

I mean, has HE been in a gay relationship? of course not. But no, he has a family and is straight and educated, the ""ultimate"" (privileged) rightful happiness, he KNOWS everything. I don't think there's a clearer example of a Shitlord, is there?

I mean, he's the typical Redditor: he says he's on your side, you know, with freedom, lefty, liberal, etc. Yet shit starts dripping from his mouth without knowing. And deep down he's as shitty, sexist and homophobic as all the rest.

I feel so broken, confused. It's like he's invalidated all the love I can feel in my life, and all that I am, what I've become. It's all bullshit because I'm not giving my penis to a vagina where it belongs...

""Man up"" uggh, I have more ""balls"" (I'm using this because this is his language pretty much) than he ever will. I want to see him, some stupid overprivilidged SAWSCM open and share his thoughts and deepest feelings to another man. I want to see him touch and kiss another man, the way he has his wife, see if he can. I want to see him come out. Please... He's the one governed by fear. At least I'm open to sharing something with a woman, learning and having a relationship etc.

It all just seems extra crazy because HE was the one who told me before homosexuality cannot be ""cured"", and that the most homophobic are repressing the homosexuality in themselves. It all just boggles my mind.

Anyway, thats it. I just wanted to vent, I wanted to share this here, where so many people I respect are. I wanted to hear some of your opinions on the whole deal.

For instance, I think many people in SRS agree that circumcision isn't acceptable. I also personally think that instances of sexual abuse on males tend to be neglected in terms of social services, etc. Furthermore, prescribed gender roles hurt both men and women in a huge way, especially those of us who don't fit in to the stereotypical roles. 

Also, in my time working in nonprofit organizations, I've seen that a lot of these services focus on women (like when it comes to sexual assault/abuse or human trafficking), even though there are plenty of male victims of those crimes. 

I truly do believe that men's rights and women's rights go hand in hand -- you can't really have one without the other. I also do think that MRAs sometimes do bring up legitimate complaints. 

The problem is the amount of hateful, despicable drivel that a lot of these groups are saturated with, and the way these complaints are turned into harmful attacks and generalizations about women. Are there any groups (whether it's a forum, a blog, or an organization) that *aren't* so terrible? 

EDIT: Originally I asked for a ""men's rights organization or group"" that isn't so terrible, but let's broaden that out to *any* organization that somehow helps address a men's rights issue. It doesn't have to call itself a ""men's rights"" organization"". It could be an organization that also focuses on women -- but really, any organization that directly and legitimately is addressing the needs of men. For instance, I've heard of groups that are targeted towards male victims of sexual abuse -- forgot the name though...

&gt; an ideology which promotes and embraces open sexuality with few limits.

Its exact antonym would be *sex negativity*. The terms ""sex negative"" and ""sex positive"" originated in [Wilhelm Reich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich)'s fundamental 1936 essay, [Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf](http://ia600603.us.archive.org/3/items/Reich_1936_Sexualitaet_im_Kulturkampf_2te_k/Reich_1936_Sexualitaet_im_Kulturkampf_2te_k.pdf) ([Sexuality in the Culture Struggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Sexualit%C3%A4t_im_Kulturkampf)). The [essential point](http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Negpos.pdf) of this essay was that some societies conceptualize sex as inherently good and embrace open sexual expression (sex-positive societies), whereas others view sex and sexuality negatively and seek to repress and control sexual freedom and drive (sex negative societies). 
Because of this essay, sex positivity is often defined in direct contrast to sex negativity. 

Perhaps predictably, sex negativity is seen as the dominant cultural view in Western cultures. Sex positivity advocates [typically point](http://books.google.com/books/about/Pleasure_and_danger.html?id=DTjBQgAACAAJ) to traditional Christanity as the source of sex negativity in the Western world - [traditional Christian mores have permeated Western traditions so deeply that they define Western cultural conceptualizations of sex](http://www.thefamilyinternational.org/dossier/books/book5/main.htm). Under these traditions, sex is seen as a destructive force when it is not directly related to its ""saving grace"" of procreation. Therefore, [sexual pleasure has been correlated to sin and ruination](http://whychurchfatherswerenegativeaboutsex.blogspot.com/), and sexual acts are [ranked in a hierarchy](http://aphroweb.net/articles/sacredpleasure.htm), with marital heterosexuality at the very top, and sex acts and orientations that deviate from the societal norm near the bottom. 

The sex positivity movement intends to work directly against the detrimental force of sex negativity. It is

&gt; ""an attitude towards human sexuality that regards all consensual sexual activities as fundamentally healthy and pleasurable, and encourages sexual pleasure and experimentation. The sex-positive movement is a social and philosophical movement that advocates these attitudes. The sex-positive movement advocates sex education and safer sex as part of its campaign."" - [Source](http://www.sexpositiveculture.org/)

With the above in mind, the sex-positivity movement makes no moral or ethical distinctions between sex acts. [BDSM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM), [polyamory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory), [asexuality](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/opzyo/effort_asexuality_101/), [transexuality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexualism), [transgenderism](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nulaq/effort_post_trans_101/), and all forms of gender transgression are accepted by advocates of the movement.

[Sex-positive feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism) is a [variant of feminism](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pec4y/effort_variants_of_feminism_101/) that was catalyzed during the 1980s by the [Feminist Sex Wars](http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/The_Sex_Wars,_1970s_to_1980s). It centers around the idea of sexual freedom as a fundamental component of women's freedom. With that in mind, it opposes any and all legal or social control over sexual activities between consenting adults. 

**Major Issues**

- **Pornography** - [Access to pornography and erotica is as important to women as it is to men.](http://www.wendymcelroy.com/freeinqu.htm) [There is nothing inherently degrading to women about pornography](http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/Forum/pornography/background/CMC_article.html). 

- **Sex Work** - [Men and women can have positive experiences](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/) with and as [sex workers](http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2008/03/13/feministe-feedback-can-a-feminist-be-a-sex-worker/). Therefore, the industry should be decriminalized, destigmatized, and regulated to discourage STDs transfer, human trafficking, and exploitation. [Sex workers themselves should not be seen as criminals and need to be destigmatized.](http://meanjin.com.au/editions/volume-70-number-1-2011/article/sex-work-and-feminism/) ""Prostitute"" is a pejorative and the appropriate term is now ""sex worker"". 

- **BDSM** - [Consensual BDSM activities can be thoroughly enjoyed by women and validate some women's sexual inclinations](http://jezebel.com/5666107/bdsm-and-feminism-stop-telling-me-what-im-supposed-to-like-dmn-it). [Deriding the sexual desires of women as being ""antifeminist"" or a sign of internalized misogyny is an inappropriate form of attack.](http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/feminism-and-submissive-desires/) There is no documented connection between consensually kinky activities and sex violence/crimes.[ It is also important to remember that within BDSM, roles are not fixed to gender, but are deigned instead by personal preferences (women are and can be dominants, men are and can be submissives).](http://www.alternet.org/sex/113745/?page=entire)   

- **Gender Identity** - [Supports the right of all individuals to determine their own gender, and promote gender fluidity as one means for achieving gender equality.](http://books.google.com/books?id=V_mHAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sex+Changes:+Transgender+Politics+%28&amp;dq=Sex+Changes:+Transgender+Politics+%28&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EedHT7boIsTEtgfMg8ykDg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA)

- **Villification of male sexuality** - Male sexuality is often villified by radical feminism. This is inappropriate and the full spectrum of human sexuality should be embraced, not demonized. 

- **Statutory Rape Laws** - There is an emergent debate in sex-positive feminism about consensual encounters between adolescents and older people. According to some sex positive feminists, [statutory rape laws](http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Law/Feminist-legal-analysis-and-sexual-autonomy-using-statutory-rape-laws-as-an-illustration.html) are [misogynistic](http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Law/Feminist-legal-analysis-and-sexual-autonomy-using-statutory-rape-laws-as-an-illustration.html) because they [assume that young pubescent women are nonsexual and naive, and need to be protected](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6700/is_n1_85/ai_n28650099/pg_10/?tag=content;col1).  This is illustrated most clearly in the controversy over Eve Ensler's inclusion of (TW) [""The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could""](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/blog/TVMscript2006.pdf) in *The Vagina Monologues*, which, lets face it, [may not be the most sex-positive play in the whole world.](http://www.equityfeminism.com/articles/2001/betty-dodson-rips-the-vagina-monologues/)

Sociology, Political Science, Psychology, Philosophy, Anthropology, Communications, and all the other social sciences seek to make sense of the social world human beings have created for themselves over the past million years of our existence. For myself, I chose to study Sociology, the study of  human interactions. Much like many of the other social sciences, it has it’s roots (in the western world, other societies have their own forms of all these fields hundreds or thousands of year before Europe) in the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. Because the period that Sociology came into being along with other social sciences it’s focus was on Europe and interactions between European people, to the detriment of other societies and groups of people.

Europe’s barbanistic and imperialistic interactions with the rest of the world over the intervening 200 years influenced the social sciences in a way that is classist, sexist, and racist in both their theories as well as the professional practice of these fields. Examples of racism for instance infecting these fields is the “culture of poverty”, eugenics, functionalism (or at least some applications of said approach), the entire field of Anthropology, and Democratic Peace Theory.

Although in recent years, the influence of the Civil Rights/Black Power, Women’s Rights, LGBT*, Anti-Colonial, and Anti-Capitalist movements have influenced a new generation of social scientists who have not been as influenced by these oppressive circumstances, problems still remain. I can only speak for myself as an African in Sociology, but there are still great and many barriers to having the oppressed voices heard in the social sciences. especially for those of us who are practitioners of those social sciences like myself. One of the most important and basic of these barriers is what I would like to call the “Assumption of Oppression Bias”.

I don’t know if I have seen this concept in other writings or pieces but I think it’s something that anyone from an oppressed background will immediately recognize. The basic dynamic of Oppressed Bias is more or less the same as all other forms of bias, that because of one’s connection to a particular idea, people/persons, or institution said person can not or will not make an objective scientific analysis of X issue. Oppression Bias is then the idea that because one is part of X oppressed group they can not or will not make an objective analysis of the conditions of that oppression, the oppressed themselves, or the oppressors involved. This is a very serious issue that I believe in many circles has and is stifling the voices of those of us who come from oppressed backgrounds.

Speaking for myself, I got involved in Sociology not for the simple purpose of learning and studying human behavior. I got involved in the field to study human behavior  for the purpose of using it (or someone else using it) to dismantle oppressive systems in our world and help build better systems of human interaction. Sociology especially has been split largely between those who feel our field’s only legitimate purpose is to catalog and organize information about human behavior while others, such as myself, argue that Sociology is only relevant in relation to it’s usefulness to fighting oppression, furthering human society, and building better institutions (regardless of political persuasion). For those of us from oppressed communities (of a racial, class, gender, or sexual nature), we have two imperatives for getting involved if we’re on the “interventionist” side of the divide. The first is because since most Sociology through its history has been done by people of privileged backgrounds, we feel that we can better understand the social circumstances related to our backgrounds than someone who has no real life interaction with them. The other reason is explicitly to contribute to information base that can further the liberation struggle of those who share our oppressed social position. Unfortunately for those two reasons people of privilege often ignore our world assuming the oppression bias.

The Oppression Bias language can be seen in many ways. One is the discouragement by Sociologists in the classroom for people to speak from anecdotes. We all know that anecdotes don’t constitute scientific information by itself but when you’re the only one in the classroom who remotely has any engagement with a certain social phenomena you would assume that people would give some deference to you on that point. Unfortunately often comments referring to life in the projects, coming out of the closet, or being from a rural town is met with silence and/or little engagement with the point or worse the student/scientist is reminded that their anecdote isn’t a scientific snapshot. Both of these responses discourages oppressed individuals from speaking from their lifetime of experience with X issue that I believe is relevant even if it didn’t come out of a research journal.

Another form of this bias that also happens in classrooms often is when an oppressed person  thinks of a writer who is not a social scientist who said or wrote something that they feel is relevant to the discussion. An especially common example of this is when a working class or poor student/scientist brings up Marx’s theory of revolution and change. We can argue all we want about whether it’s right or not but it’s interesting to always see the weird looks one gets when they reference him and one would assume that the looks reflect thoughts that resemble “commie…” It also happens when racial minorities mention revolutionaries of their people in conversation. There’s an assumption that often goes through the person who’s about to speak head that these people will dismiss this writer’s point because they aren’t a “scientist” like they are.

Assumptions of Oppression Bias of the above mentioned forms and others (“they have an “agenda”"" accusation is another one) stifles voices of students, social scientists, and laypersons alike and contributes to a weird Catch-22 that all oppressed people in the social sciences have to face, or will face. You come into the field wanting to study “your people” because the current crop of people and studies have failed to do so in a decent way (or at all) and indeed there is almost a responsibility to do so because no one else will. The problem is that because you do that, you are assumed to have an agenda and much of your writing is proving the worth of either the topic of discussion itself or super reinforcing your logic to make sure NO ONE can question your work. This is a very uncomfortable position to be in and for many of us, it wears us down…a lot.

For Sociology and other social sciences to move forward towards a more fair and equitable picture of the social world, we will have to confront professional/psychological forms of suppression such as the Oppression Bias Assumption. If we don’t our fields will continue into the far future to be too heavily weighted in favor of the interest, logic, and perspective of the privileged to the disadvantage of  the oppressed. That is a field I’d rather not be a part of.

It has reached the point where I can’t unsee it, whenever the *Daily Show* and *Colbert Report*. In their—and the writers’—world, if you are a Republican they disagree with, it is fair game to delegitimize their opinions by making jokes about how fucking fat and ugly they are.

[An older article from 2009 about weightism on Colbert](http://jigglybits.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/stephen-colbert-talks-weightism/). An excerpt:

&gt;Now that I’ve watched it again, I find more things disgusting about it than I did before. I think what really bothers me is that I feel like the audience isn’t laughing at the satire of what he’s saying, but rather laughing AT fat people. That, I believe is why I’m so disturbed by this video which is fantastic otherwise…
&gt;
&gt;(...)
&gt;
&gt;However, I still have major issues with Colbert’s topical introduction. I know it’s his gimmick to be satirical and present the opposite opinion of what he really believes, but I just can’t get over the fact that in order to introduce the topic of weightism, he had to crack jokes about fat people being x/y/z. Afterward, though I was pleased with the discussion, I still left feeling a little put out. I know that sometimes when I watch that show, I listen to his funny monologue, and then I switch channels when the experts come on (because often, I’m only watching for the jokes). If I had done that last night (and I almost did), I would’ve missed the real substantive part of the interview.

I hear this phrase from time to time, mostly on Reddit for the sheer fact that I spend most of my time on Reddit, but it's certainly not a thought unique to this site.


It frustrates me that people try to dismiss the feminist movement because they think that, because the definition includes the word ""equality"" in it, it must therefore include men in it, as well.

It frustrates me in part, because it demonstrates a lack of knowledge of what feminism is about. Feminism isn't just about women - it's about our understanding of the conceptualization of gender, the influence of society on the gender system, the gender system on the influence of society, the intersectionality of constructs like race, gender, class, sexual orientation, body variations, etc on the formation of identity, privilege, and power.

People who say something about feminism not being about equality demonstrate a serious lack of understanding about what feminism and feminist theory actually are. Right now I'm reading a book called ""Masculinity Studies and Feminist Theory."" I really like it. I think masculinity studies are important. But the more I read about it, the more clear my understanding is of how masculinity studies and feminist theory are really quite compatible, the more I get pissed off over how the loudest dissenters of feminism are also the most ignorant about it.

But another thing that bothers me is that feminism is the only movement that is held to the standard of having to pay attention to all groups, including the one in power. Nobody is calling into question race-based civil rights or gay rights activists in their declaration of the desire for equality, even though we don't see people of color talking about ways in which White people are oppressed or gay rights addressing laws are problematic for heterosexual couples.

But I think that misogyny is the driving power behind most of what the movement produces in terms of literature (particularly the monetized literature like beta/alpha male how-to blogs and people like ""Dr Tara"" - who got her degree from a diploma mill).

What I want to know is if anyone has looked into this in a systematic way to find out what the movement is really concerned about. Because when we read the threads on MR most of what we read is hatred for women, and not concern for other men. I think that the movement has an issue where their collective masculine identity is so egotistical, angry, and violent that they cannot muster up public empathy or support for other men, and instead direct their energy into hatred towards ""modern"" women. When they *can* rarely muster it you can see the unease and vulnerability in their voices because it is entirely out of their element.

I suppose what I want to ask is *who makes up this movement*? Because based on the central issues named in the thread title - it seems like it is a very fearful, very paranoid, and very sexually and emotionally insecure minority of men. This is not to say that there are other good members who don't fit that description, but that the major driving force behind the movement is made up of insecure ""beta males"" looking for a group to identify with.

Make no mistake though, it isn't really about the sperm.

Before I begin, a disclaimer.

I am a single person. My experiences do not, and cannot, represent the full picture of asexuality, nor am I some kind of designated asexual spokesperson. At the end of the day the only things I can take full credit for are my own experiences.

I also have a sinking feeling that a large part of the stuff I'm going to say will be ~~pulled out of my ass~~ unsourced. I consider myself a probably-aromantic sex-averse asexual.

**What is asexuality?**

The general consensus and the [AVEN](http://www.asexuality.org)-given definition is,

&gt; Asexual people are people who do not experience sexual attraction.

I am very hesitant to label anyone as asexual. If the label fits and sounds right, use it. Nobody can pick a label for you. 

**The Asexual Spectrum**

The asexual spectrum includes asexuals, grey- (or gray-) asexual, and demisexual people. Though often we talk of asexual people, more correctly we should be talking about people in the asexual spectrum. 

So far we have asexuality defined as not experiencing sexual attraction. However, for some people, this is not as clear-cut. Grey-Asexuality is a descriptor for people who partially identify as asexual for a number of reasons. Demisexual people on the other hand do not experience *primary* sexual attraction, but do experience secondary sexual attraction.

What's the difference? Primary sexual attraction is attraction-at-first-sight, so to speak, the instant flash of ""ze's hot, I'd want to have sex with zir."" Secondary sexual attraction is sexual attraction that happens after getting to know the person better, forming emotional and/or romantic bonds.

**Is it really a sexual orientation?**

Short answer: yes.

Long answer: Yes, because asexuality is not the complete lack of sexuality at all. Some asexuals have a sex drive. Some don't. Some are repulsed by sex. Some are indifferent. Some like intimate physical gestures, like kissing. Some don't. The asexual spectrum is not a monolith.

**Asexuality and the DSM**

Although asexuality is not explicitly in the DSM-IV, Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) is. [HSDD is defined as](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoactive_sexual_desire_disorder):

&gt; a sexual dysfunction... characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity for some period of time.

Technically, a person has to be distressed by said lack of sexual fantasies or desire for sexual activity to be diagnosed with HSDD. However, it patholigizes asexuality, slapping an unnecessary label on people who don't have HSDD. Currently, there's a campaign to amend the definition of HSDD, so that it accommodates asexuality. 

[A detailed post about the campaign to change HSDD in the DSM-IV.](http://asexystuff.blogspot.com/2009/03/hypoactive-sexual-desire-disorder-and.html)

**A Brief History of the Asexual Community**

Though asexuality has presumably existed for a very long time, the asexual community - and the term itself - is relatively young. In 1994, a survey of some 19,000 British residents found that 1% had never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all. The 1% figure is still quoted as the approximate percentage of asexual people in a given population.

Because of the difficulty in communicating and sharing experiences, it wasn't until the development of the internet that the asexual community started. Because of its relative obscurity, and the extreme normalization of the experiences of sexual people, it was very hard to realise that asexuality wasn't just a personal issue. The first online asexual communities were set up around the year 2000. AVEN, currently the biggest asexual space, was set up in 2001. Some communities were also set up that catered to anti-sexual views. At this time the definition of asexuality was varied and the community was fractured. Eventually a definition of asexuality was constructed based on orientation, and (at least on AVEN) it was decided that anyone who identified as asexual was asexual, regardless of other factors like sex drive. The community expanded steadily. Media interest grew, and asexual symbols - such as the upside-down triangle (for AVEN), wearing a black ring on the right middle finger, the purple flag and the odd fixation on cake - were developed.

[Everything taken from this thread on AVEN.](http://www.asexuality.org/en/index.php?/topic/62278-a-history-of-asexuality/)

**Sexual vs. Romantic Orientation**

Though we usually merge the two together and assume that A follows B or vice versa, when you remove sexual attraction from the equation, a different picture emerges. Generally we are told that if person A is heterosexual, we can infer that they are both sexually attracted and romantically attracted to members of the opposite gender. If person B is homosexual, they are sexually and romantically attracted to members of the same gender and so on.

However, for asexual people, there is a distinction. Asexual people are not automatically aromantic as well, though of course some are. You can very broadly separate asexual people into two groups, aromantic and romantic. Aromantic asexuals do not experience romantic attraction, while romantic asexuals do. Romantic asexuals can be heteroromantic, homoromantic, biromantic, panromantic or really any other combination. It's also possible to be a sexual aromantic, or (for example) a bisexual homoromantic. In my own opinion this separation of sexual from romantic attraction is much more flexible and accurate than lumping the two together. Again, this is on a spectrum - just as there are grey-asexuals and demisexuals, there are also grey-romantics and demiromantics.

**Common Questions**

Many of these were lifted from the Asexual Troll Bingo. Go Google it.

*""Do you masturbate?""*

I have no idea why this is always the first (or nearly the first) question. I mean. Seriously.

The answer to this is that it depends on the person. Some asexuals are libidinous i.e. have a sex drive, and so may masturbate. There are a lot of reasons why. Some asexuals don't have a sex drive, or have a reduced sex drive. Some asexuals might have sexual fantasies. Some don't. Some asexuals have fetishes, as well. Some don't. Again, it is always individual, and it makes no sense to make a blanket statement like ""asexuals all do/don't masturbate"".

*""Are you sure there's nothing wrong with you?"" or ""Have you had your hormones checked?""*

Asexuality is not due to any aberration in body chemistry, and certainly not due to hormonal imbalance. While it’s true that some people suffer from a decreased sex drive due to hormonal changes or other changes to body chemistry, asexuals lack sexual attraction – it’s not the same thing. Plus, it’s insulting, because it infers that asexuals must have something wrong with their bodies to ‘make them that way’.

*""Are you sure it's not just a phase?"" or ""Are you sure you're not just straight/gay/bisexual?""*

Good grief I have seen this one thrown around a lot. Yes, sexuality is fluid. But, for this opinion to be valid, consider the fact that if you think we’re not really asexual, then it follows that a gay person might not really be gay and a straight person might not really be straight. Even so, you should support whatever sexuality a person identifies as. Just because there’s a possibility of change doesn’t make it any less valid. The same is true for the opposite direction; if you once identified as asexual, that doesn’t then mean that all other asexuals are going through a phase. Everyone has their own experience.

The other problem with the second question is that the asexual community occasionally gets attacked and artificially split up, by people outside the community, according to romantic orientation. This has happened before in discussions about whether or not asexuals can call themselves queer; I've seen some very vitriolic comments saying ""heteroromantic asexuals aren't queer enough/are encroaching on queer spaces"" or some variant of that (aromantics... tend to confuse them.) 

*""Isn't it unfair if you're dating a sexual person?"" or ""So do you only date other asexual people?""*

Being a romantically inexperienced probably-aromantic I am not going to be very good at answering this! But from what I can gather, it's (again) an individual thing. Every relationship is different, and everyone will have different views on what they want in a romance.

1366085052.0,57,self.SRSDiscussion,1cfvqz,"PUAs, MRAs, Sex Tourists: reproducing colonial discourse OR MRA Worldview: sexist *and* racist?",ThePerdmeister,74,17,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1cfvqz/puas_mras_sex_tourists_reproducing_colonial/,"So I've been doing some reading on global sex tourism, when I came across the following quote taken from a flash banner on a sex tourist website:

""Know what the difference between sex for money and sex for free is? Sex for money is a LOT cheaper! Are you an adventurous single male? Recently been FUCKED over in a divorce perhaps? 

*Or maybe just looking for a good time with women who aren't feminist, Men-hating BITCHES!*

Learn all you'll need to know to enjoy a vacation or start a new life among beautiful, young, nubile, NON-complaining women! Women whose soul [sic] desire is to please YOU and not THEMSELVES!""

It got me thinking. Most of the ""men going their own way"" or whatever pick up artist communities (as well as MRA communities) seem to hold similar opinions regarding the current cultural status of Western women (that is, women seem to be all too free for their tastes), and a number of members of such communities encourage other PUAs to expand their conceptions of viable prey to include non-white women in countries such as Thailand, Brazil, Costa Rica, The Philippines, Kenya, etc.

The relationship between this sort of activity and colonialism is readily apparent, but I think it becomes even more clear when you consider this quote from Stoler's *Making Empire Respectable*: ""Sexual control affected the very nature of colonial relations themselves. In colonial scholarship, sexual domination has figured as a social metaphor of European supremacy. Thus, in Edward Said's treatment of orientalist discourse, the sexual submission and possession of Oriental women by European men 'stands for the pattern of relative strength between East and West.' In this male power-fantasy the Orient is penetrated, silenced, and possessed."" It seems PUAs and sex tourists have merely taken a page from colonial discourse and made it an essential part of their worldview.

As well, the whole trope of blaming American women for the shitty behaviour of men (IE- ""those stuck-up feminists made me go overseas to fuck underage sex workers"") seems to parallel another aspect of colonialism which I think can be explicated by another quote (sorry for the essay format): ""Men were considered more susceptible to moral turpitude than women, who were thus held responsible for the immoral states of men. European women were to create and protect colonial prestige, insulating their men from cultural and sexual contact with the colonized... Sexual temptations with women of colour would be curtailed by a happy family life. Moral laxity would be eliminated through the example and vigilance of women whose status was defined by their sexual restraint and dedication to their homes and to their men."" Sounds awfully similar to the ""woe is me, I can't find a wife who'll stick to the kitchen"" and/or ""all women are promiscuous/cheat/lie about rape to cover their promiscuity"" mentality of MRAs and PUAs.

It's always been readily apparent that MRAs and PUAs attempt to reproduce sexist power structures, but I had never considered the possibility that the two reproduce racist, colonial power structures as well. It's relatively obvious now that the PUA community reproduces colonialist ideology in their belief that white, straight, American women are prissy, selfish, over-sexual (ironically conjuring up colonial attitudes about marginalized groups' sexuality and placing them on white women) and whathaveyou, thereby reducing non-white, non-Western women to this submissive, Ideally Feminine™, housewife-ish archetype. But it seems the racist tendencies of MRA communities are more subdued or implicit. Are the anti-feminist tendencies of MRAs also guided by racist beliefs? Is it fair to say that, in conjuring an image of (generally white, regardless of their belief in colour-blindness) American women as man-hating, overly-progressive feminists, MRAs implicitly designate non-American women as more in-tune with natural femininity (ie- more primitive, to borrow the words of bell hooks)?

Or maybe there's a more explicit example of MRA racism that I've wholly forgotten. Anyone have any further reading I could do in regards to this? Any thoughts? I'd really like to explore the intersections of sexism, heterosexism, and racism in MRA ideology, and I'm sure there've been a number of posts with similar sentiments. 

EDIT: I realize that the MRA preoccupation with male ""gender discrimination"" and ""reverse-sexism"" ignores issues of class, race, sexuality and such, and in that way the MRA movement is implicitly racist, but I'm wondering more specifically if they reproduce colonialist attitudes in a similar way to PUAs and sex tourists (perhaps the overlap of MRA and PUA communities is enough to dismiss the two as racist).

EDIT2.0: Is there any indication that MRAs are against affirmative action? I can only imagine much of the movement is libertarian and thereby knee-jerkingly against any sort of patronizing, paternalistic leg-up programs (that are nonetheless an important step towards formal and informal inclusivity), but this might just be due to my interactions with Reddit MRAs.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,1366153603.0,,,True,t3_1cfvqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1cfvqz/puas_mras_sex_tourists_reproducing_colonial/,

I like to think of analogies for things and was trying to figure out one that helped me conceptualize why this situation was definitely rape. This is one I thought of and I was wondering if it's accurate or if you could think of a better one:

You go into a grocery store everyday and there's a police officer by the door who tells you not to leave the store without paying for your food or you will get arrested. You decide to listen to the officer's advice and go about your shopping, paying for your food and then leaving. You do this for a few months, years, whatever.

Then, one day you decide to go shopping, get your groceries, but as you approach the register, you realize you have no cash on you. You decide to walk straight past the police officer without paying and you do just that. The officer doesn't stop or arrest you and you can go home without paying for your groceries.

Regardless of the police officer's behavior in this situation, you *still committed theft/robbery*.

1340984694.0,56,self.SRSDiscussion,vss05,"How can we engage in conversations on fraught subjects?  In particular, health and weight --",SRSAltAcct,64,8,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/vss05/how_can_we_engage_in_conversations_on_fraught/,"This has been freaking me out for a while now.


For the last six months, I've been working with a non-profit affiliated with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  We work with NYCHA residences, privately run shelters and mental-health residences, public schools, and outreach programs to bring awareness and assistance to the needy and underserved -- targeting a number of different metrics.  The most important, in the New York City projects, is weight and nutrition.


There is a culture of fat-shaming on reddit, on the internet at large, and in the modern developed world.  It is vicious and hurtful.  SRS, and in a much larger fashion, most of the progressives that I know, do a good job of challenging the idea that being overweight is somehow fair game for criticism and mockery, and that is an extremely important task.  Obesity has a huge number of factors, and among the *least* relevant is willpower; genetics, emotional trauma, socioeconomic background and upbringing are all vastly more important to understand when looking at the sources of the modern obesity epidemic.


But I work in communities stricken with obesity.  I work with children whose idea of lunch is a bucket of Crown fried chicken, who can't climb the stairs of their own elementary schools, whose idea of fresh fruits and vegetables is entirely limited to the one browning apple a day they get at their free lunch program.  I work with families whose medical histories look like bad jokes; heart attacks and heart disease *down the line*.  I work with mothers whose EBT coupons go to processed bologna, mayonnaise, white bread and beer.  I live down the street from a hospital, and every time the ambulance drives by, the stoop-sitters down the street shout, 'Fried chicken got another one!'


Obesity -- at least of the urban poor variety -- is dangerous.  It is very often a disease of the underprivileged, and in communities like this, there is no way of separating 'health' from 'weight' in a way that isn't disingenuous.  The way that kids eat here is bad because their food is overloaded with saturated fats, processed sugars, and sodium.  Those foods make them fat, and those foods sap their energy, and those foods make it hard for them to exercise and to study.


I *cannot* have a conversation about nutrition in the communities in which I work without addressing the fact that their parents are dying younger because of their weight, their kids are struggling in school because of their diets, and obesity is both a result and a cause of both.


So when I come on reddit and see people being treated terribly because of their weight, it makes me horribly sad.  But it also makes me horribly upset to see what a vocal defense is made of 'being fat' [as a population statement, rather than an individual one].  Obesity is a disease, and like any disease, it is *nobody's* fault that they are sick.  If your life is satisfying, that is absolutely awesome, and you owe nobody an explanation or a defense.  But I don't understand how you can justify extending that sentiment to another person; particularly when that person is a child, or a member of a societal group virtually forced into the circumstances of their own illness.  It sounds to me exactly like the 'special snowflaking' that we mock so greatly; you're a woman and you don't mind being objectified?  Great!  Stop telling all women how to feel.  You're overweight and you feel good about your health and your body?  That's awesome!  But I don't see how you get to speak for the community of overweight people.


I don't know how to phrase this discussion.  I don't know how to address in myself the cross-sectional anger that comes from reading cruel and petty shit attacking fat people on reddit at large and then reading the diametric opposite; some sort of 'fat apologia'; on SRS.  Nobody ever *blamed* the impoverished for being too skinny due to malnourishment, but we still as a society tried to give them food -- the malnourishment now takes a different form but the result is still unhealthy.


Blah.  I've written a lot and I hope I haven't said anything hurtful.

I'm posting this with a new account because I discovered (to my surprise) that my main account was banned here despite never having posted in this or any other SRS-related subreddit. I assume this is because I made a post in antisrs asking about the nature of SRS, though I think it's an unfair move as I was very even-handed about it. I'm not here to argue against any of the fundamental assumptions made here. I'm just here to listen and discuss.

I've attempted to look up all of the jargon used around here, so here it goes: I'm a heterosexual, cisgendered, able bodied white male. I'm in great physical shape and have been told I'm attractive. I come from a lower-middle class background, but I was never starving or in a questionable neighborhood. The only thing that puts me in a fringe group is the fact that I'm an atheist, but that's not exactly something that I wear on my sleeve and is probably not a basis for open discrimination against me.

I'm here because I saw a post that I thought discriminated against minorities, and made a comment contemplating the nature of racism and discrimination. I made the assertion that discrimination against anyone because of their race or any other association of that type was wrong. I also said that it's just as wrong to discriminate against or stereotype white people, since all hatred is the same. I was shocked when this comment was posted to /r/ShitRedditSays (which I hadn't heard of before), and widely derided as being somehow racist. I felt as if there had been a terrible misunderstanding, but it didn't seem like anyone wanted to hear what I had to say about it.

I now recognize the ""circlejerk"" nature of /r/ShitRedditSays wasn't exactly conducive to clarifying the views of social justice advocates. It felt more like an aggressive slap in the face than a civil discussion. When I lamented about this, it was suggested by someone at /r/antisrs that I come here to make my inquiries.

I've always considered myself to be about as colorblind and open-minded as they come. I think equal rights are fundamental, and find discrimination against people due to race, gender, sexual orientation or any number of things is abhorrent. However, I felt as if many assumptions were made about me immediately and unfairly by the folks at SRS. It seemed like they found my very existence offensive. I'm hoping that any discussion here will be more productive.

So, what should I know? What should I be doing to make the world a better place for everyone? Why isn't it okay for me to be upset when someone says something derogatory about white people as a group? I feel as if someone is judging me by the color of my skin rather than the content of my character, to paraphrase MLK, Jr. I want to hear your opinions and perspectives. My mind is open.

They've been very enlightening so far, and have done a great job of pointing out to me how limited my life experience has been when it comes to these matters.

First, I think that when MRAs look at a situation like the 14-year old getting pressured into having sex (or any girl for that matter), they automatically misinterpret the situation due to fear. This happens because they imagine themselves hooking up with a girl who is mildly excited, but maybe not incredibly enthusiastic about hooking up and has no apparent reservations. They believe they both had a good time (maybe decent, but certainly not horrible) and the guy gets a rape charge thrown at him.

[TW]

However, is this really how the situation is EVER played out? Wouldn't it be pretty obvious (if not incredibly obvious) to most guys if the girl wasn't interested and was too scared to say no? Wouldn't the girl not be into things at all if she was as reluctant as the 14-year old? I'm not saying she's going to be fighting the guy off with fists because after reading so many rape stories posted on Reddit, it seems most women are frozen in their tracks. How could a man continue to take things further if the woman didn't seem downright enthusiastic about it? I've definitely been in situations where I would be kissing a girl and have attempted to take things further but her excitement seemed to stop and from there it was pretty obvious for us to take a step back or for me to end things right then and there. I'm not trying to toot my own horn but do most rapists just lack this ability to read other people or do they simply not care?

I'm curious as to the answers to some of these questions. I think they are important for showing a lot of MRAs how it's not as ""easy"" to be a rapist as they think or get falsely accused of being a rapist. I haven't done a lot of r/MensRights browsing lately (I used to frequent the subreddit about a year ago) and maybe it's changed, but I don't think most of them are completely oblivious. I think they just mistrust women which, while not a good thing, does not mean they're going to be rapists. But I do think it's important that some of them are told that most of them are not going to be falsely accused of rape because they're probably decent judges of body language and can tell when a woman isn't feeling it.

Maybe this is the completely wrong way to go about doing things and will contribute to an increase in rapists (I hope not) but I think it's a different way to understand the MRA perspective because I was once there and somehow made the change.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_snje6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/snje6/tw_discussion_about_mras_and_their_response_to/,

As we've seen with the latest drama over Rebecca Watson's blog, a whole lot of people have this idea that Reddit and the internet in general is complete anarchy. There are no rules, they can say whatever they want, up to and including threatening to rape children. Seriously ugly, nasty, hateful shit.

It's supposed to be funny.  Why can't we take a joke?

That sentiment seems to last right up to the point where we post and comment on that sort of behavior in SRS. Somehow, the internet is a total free for all, people who get upset about it are whiny bitches, and it's all just a joke that we shouldn't take seriously. And then SRS talks about someone on the internet, and we're evil trolls who are destroying everything. We're a hate group. SRS should be banned.

So what's the difference? How come we're all supposed to be able to take a joke, no matter how offensive or hurtful, but we're horrible people if we turn the mirror around or give any back?

I thought I was a special snowflake and that my husband's racist comments were hilarious... But I've grown up, informed myself and helped my husband come around too. Unfortunately I can't say the same for some of our friends.

The more I try to inform myself, the less I can stand being around my husband's best friend. It seems like he can't go 5 minutes without saying something sexist, racist, or homophobic.

I've been avoiding him but last night we went to dinner and I didn't smile the entire time because of the disgusting shit that kept coming out of his mouth. His friend joined us too and he was just as bad.

Between these two pieces of shit here's what I heard last night.

-when we first arrived he saw a waitress with a short skirt and was creepily staring at her. He said ""with a tattoo on those legs I really can't help but stare."" I said ""you're a grown man, control your impulses""... He just kept staring and when she walked away he went ""I don't regret it, I saw panty.""

-a group of girls walked in and sat down at a table next to us. Some of them were Asian and he just said ""Asians"" in disgust 

-the girls used some chairs that we were hoping to get for friends joining us later so him and his friend used this as justification for insulting them the whole night. They referred to them as plugs, questioned their right to be there because they weren't watching hockey, and used a multitude of Asian slurs

-used vagina and gay as pejoratives

-called our waitress a slut when she didn't notice that they were trying to get her attention

-joked that they should get the East Indian manager to get them a cab since obvi he knows all cab drivers hurr durr

-LOL FAT PEOPLE

Etc...

&gt;This.  The racist attack against a white person is simply to presume that they are a racist or a bigot based on nothing other than the color of their skin.

&gt;This cuts to an actual stereotype about white people that people believe, and is genuinely hurtful to white people who are *not* racists.

&gt;They can be extremely self-conscious about it, and even that self-consciousness is lampooned.  (How many times have you heard the old, ""But I have plenty of black friends!""?)

&gt;Don't get me wrong.  If this is the worst racial oppression white people ever have to face, we got the sweet end of the deal by *far*.  But to say that there is *no* racial bigotry directed toward white people, no stereotyping, or that a white person has never been made to feel inferior based solely on his or her race would be inaccurate.

Why is it wrong to say that calling all white people racist is offensive? As a person who puts a lot of effort into not being racist, I think it's reasonable to say that one of the most hurtful things you could accuse me of is racism.

Humanities, Shitlordery, and Reddit",textrovert,69,18,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/w4sw1/antiintellectualism_in_the_sciences_v_humanities/,"Sorry about the length of what follows. Full disclosure: I'm a PhD student in a humanities discipline who partly studies the historical development of concepts of objectivity and subjectivity in both the arts and sciences, so I feel like I have something of a vested interest in these questions on multiple levels, and have been thinking about them in a variety of contexts and am partly just getting it off my chest. But I think it's really central to my idea of why Reddit is the way it is and thought some of you might have also been thinking about it, so I wanted to know what the Fempire thought!

I've been thinking about [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/w3sbr/have_you_read_the_myth_of_male_power_if_not_here/) (reminder: don't touch the votes!) over in the anti-feminist bastion AskFeminists, as well as [the thread here on credentialism](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/w06ny/credentialism_every_legit/). In the former, someone posted quotes from the MRA demigod, Warren Farrell, one-time first/second-wave feminist scholar and now widely discredited cultural theorist and critic. I pointed out that when 99% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic global warming is happening, it's fair to dismiss the dissenting 1% who think it's a conspiracy theory as probable nutjobs, not see them as crusaders for truth against a delusional conspiracy, and then argued that the same applies to gender scholars, for when 99% of them agree that patriarchy is a thing. Predictably, they essentially said it's not the same because gender studies really *is* a conspiracy, and further, it's not a hard science so it's bullshit anyway.

So I'm thinking about why it's so easy for them to dismiss, and what their views on gender have to do with their views on the humanities and social sciences that are not primarily quantitative. It strikes me as really anti-intellectual, something that Reddit is ostensibly against, but you know, they only seem to use ""anti-intellectual"" to talk about people who reject science. But to have a bunch of people with no training in or even real exposure to these fields dismissing them as useless and delusional and lacking in methodology or rigor (!), and thinking that that is not anti-intellectual but actually the opposite, is just bizarre to me.

And here's where the part on credentialism comes in: I'm aware that science is *not* like the humanities in many ways because the humanities are meant to be drawn partly from ""subjective"" everyday experience, and should be somewhat more accessible. We accept science based on networks and structures of trust, built on credentialism - I have absolutely no way of scrutinizing the existence of the Higgs-Boson but I trust that someone found it and I equally trust that it's important because now we can account for mass on the subatomic level. It's not the same with social theories - people ought to be able to recognize and identify with them on some level, and should be able to scrutinize them. But where do you draw the line? How do you balance the fact that really smart people devote their lives to studying this stuff and have to be subject to rigorous peer review with people's lived experience? I'm also reminded of [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/vzgbb/picture_of_chained_slave_this_little_guy_ran_away/c597hse) I got the other day, about the odd position humanities disciplines are in, both relying on the status quo of unjust social and economic structures to survive, but also being in the position of challenging them.

I also suspect that part of the ability to dismiss entire fields while maintaining a self-image of intellectual has to do with the fact that these fields have, in the last 40 years or so, been flooded with both women and minorities - and by ""flooded"" I mean that the gender balance is close to 50/50 in many of them, and the number of scholars of color is still far less than the general population but significantly closer than STEM fields. Since ""straight white able-bodied cis etc. male"" is the universalized default (uh oh, now I'm getting into theories of gender!), to be something else creates the perception of bias, as if everything you do is colored by - and skewed by - your identity in a way that it's not for white men. The drop in credibility of these fields (way more people used to be English and philosophy and history majors, and they were considered worth and noble pursuits, mid-century and before) corresponds pretty well to those fields being opened to those who had been construed as ""others,"" and I don't think that's a coincidence.

**tl;dr - Why do you think Reddit so easily dismisses non-quantitative scholarly consensus? Is it fair to compare widely-accepted scholarly consensus in the humanities and social sciences to that in science, even as an analogy? Is it classist, elitist, etc. to value scholars' over laymen's opinions in those fields? Or am I right that its dismissal has something to do with its pervasive sexism, racism, privilege denial, etc. - or am I comparing apples and oranges?**",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_w4sw1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/w4sw1/antiintellectualism_in_the_sciences_v_humanities/,

I wanted to examine just a few of the things he's said in response to the general kinda-sorta defense of his style I tend to see from people who otherwise try not to be shitlords.

&gt;Everybody has different words that offend them, different things that they hear that they get offended by... To me, the thing that offends me the most, is every time that I hear ""the N-word."" Not ""n----r"" by the way. I mean ""the N-word."" Literally, whenever a white lady on CNN with nice hair says, ""The N-word,"" that’s just white people getting away with saying ""n----r,"" that’s all that is. They found a way to say ""n----r."" ""N-word!"" It’s bullshit 'cause when you say ""the N-word"" you put the word ""n----r"" in the listeners head. That’s what saying a word is. You say ""the N-word"" and I go ""Oh, she means 'n----r'."" Your making me say it in my head! Why don’t you fuckin' say it instead and take responsibility, with the shitty words you wanna say. Just say it, don’t hide behind the first letter like a f-----t just say it. Say ""n----r"" you stupid c----t!

This is literally the shit we hate redditors for. Taking something that's really ugly with a monstrous history and then saying ""You know whats worse?""

Louis CK is here arguing that someone that doesn't want to take license with the n word is more offensive to him than the slur. He wishes people would just say the word so he could be more comfortable.  This isn't sophisticated humor ABOUT racism. This is just ignorant bullshit.

more:

&gt;Louis C.K.: (pointing to himself and Chris Rock) ""We say ""n----r"" on stage, you guys don't.""

&gt;Gervais: ""We can pair up different ways, but that's definitely a pairing.""

&gt;L.C.K.: (pointing to himself and Gervais) ""You and me say 'n----r' in private, these two guys don't.""

Seinfelds response in this conversation is great he says ""You've found the humor in it. I haven't found it. Nor do I seek it.""

There's nothing to defend Louis for here. He's admitting to taking license with the word, and joking that others say it when no one is around. It's not humor about racism, it's using a word he has no claim to and further joking about flippant use of the word when there's no one to hold them accountable.

more:
&gt;I sometime say terrible things 'cause it's funny to me. It just makes me laugh to say ""AIDS..."" I know, it's childish right? And the word ""n----r"" just makes me laugh. It just does. And it's a terrible word and I think that all of us, all of us that use it ironically and think that we're being not racist are fooling ourselves. Because say it to a black guy with your little ""goatee irony"" and see how funny he thinks that shit is. It's cowardly, and I'm definitely a part of that cowardice. 'Cause it's just so awful, that it makes me laugh to say it copiously.

And yeah, I get what he's saying here, so please don't tediously try to spell it out for me, Regardless of anything true he's saying here, He's still taking license with the word.

I was going to include another bit he did where he argues that the word shouldn't be taken out of Huckleberry Finn. Because I agree with his reasoning if not his ability to cram saying the word about 50 times into his short argument on the matter.  The reason I don't include it is because I simply don't believe him.  He found a defensible stance to take that lets him indulge his unbridled love of saying the word out loud.

He's a funny guy a lot of the time. He's also a grown man who should know better. And we have a people explaining on SRS prime that his humor is actually nuanced humor ABOUT racism. Please. He's saying a horrible word as much as he can because he straight up likes saying it. He's normalizing its usage but because he tickles our funny bones we're super eager to write off his views on the N word as nuanced. 

Edited to add:

Bonus points and I can't believe I forgot this, because it was my first time watching his show. But this bit right here?

There are several points I dislike. I've been offered drinks by men I haven't been interested in. I like being bought drinks. I accept because they are offered, regardles of whether I'm interested in the man. This is apparently unacceptable behaviour according to Reddit. I still converse and chat with my new acquaintance, regardless of attraction.

I feel if I'm offered something I want, there should be no harm in taking it. I also believe I don't owe someone anything for accepting it.

However, people see this as leading me on and being a bad person. That it's goldigging and shitty behaviour. I understand if I ask to be bought a drink maybe it would be different, but being offered... I don't know.

These thread call women slurs if they don't end up flirting/attempting to be romantically interested.

What does SRS think?

**EDIT**: Okay I think I've found out a lot more about expectations, social cues, objectification and sexualization around this thread. Here's a little summary on what I've found pertaining to hetereosexual rituals of men buying ladies drinks:

When people buy drinks for eachother it is considered a social cue of interest. If it is not towards women you are attracted to it is considered a friendly offering of good will. If it is towards a woman it is a sign of romantic interest. Doesn't mean sex, but could lead to it.

Some people believe it is the woman's perogative to turn the drink down as to not get the guy's hopes up. That it is anywhere from slightly shady to morally unacceptable.

I guess what I have a problem with is the sexualization, sexism and objectification going on with the whole interaction. The sexism being that it seems that heterosexual men will buy drinks for eachother as sign of friendship and interest, and there's no perogative or expectation surrounding the giving and accepting. Whereas it is apparent that a lot of men only buy a drink for a woman out of romantic interest, and it is the woman's perogative to either being romantically/sexually interested in him, or turn the drink down. No in between of it being a friendly interaction, without further intentions. Even the concept that the man is ""wasting"" his money if the woman is not/does not romantically/sexually interested in him is a bit sad.

As one person said, it's the ""nice guy"" view distilled into one action.

So in conclusion, I have to say I will continue to accept drinks. I take it as an invitation to a conversation, after all when someone gives me a gift I appreciate I will certainly spend time with them, maybe a round of pool.

If someone gets mad about attraction not being returned after a drink purchase, they need to re-evaluate their actions.

(Specifically, Hawaiian)",keakealani,67,17,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1661oy/im_not_sure_how_many_people_will_be_able_to/,"All right. I really hope this doesn't come across as ranty or unproductive, but I admit I'm still a little upset.

This is an issue I've been chewing on for a while, but it's hard to articulate and I feel like there is a lot of background history that needs to be summarized for context, so forgive me for being a little verbose.

For personal context, I am a person of part-Hawaiian decent who was raised in Hawaii and very recently moved to the mainland for the first time, after living in Hawaii for around ~20 years. I am also engaged to a person who was also raised in Hawaii, but is not part-Hawaiian. I also have family roots (besides the obvious Hawaiian ones) that span back several generations, while his parents are military transplants to Hawaii and all his roots from there are from the mainland or Europe. So we've discussed a lot of these issues coming from both those perspectives, but necessarily don't have a great grasp of the flip side - we have no first-hand perspective of not being raised in Hawaii.

So anyway. This is a combination of several issues, but it came to mind especially tonight because of a post on another subreddit about the item of clothing which, to my understanding, is referred to on the mainland as the ""Hawaiian Shirt"". (The analogous item of clothing is referred to in Hawaii as an ""[Aloha Shirt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_shirt)""). For some brief historical context, while Aloha shirts are absolutely a part of modern Hawaiian attire, they are not derived from the traditional attire worn by pre-contact Hawaiians; there are even some vague imperialist overtones in the fact that collared shirts originated in Hawaii due to missionaries, who deemed traditional Hawaiian attire to be inappropriate for a church setting. The Wikipedia article also points out that they were originally created by a Japanese person living in Hawaii, so on all counts, Aloha shirts basically in no way represent anything about native Hawaiian culture, even though they are part of the modern culture (which is itself a vast mixing pot derived from many cultures).

Why does this matter? Well, to me, it was one tangible example of something that I've been struggling with for a while. In general, native peoples have been pretty oppressed through post-colonial history. And in general, native peoples have suffered from a strong issue of not only being overtly oppressed, but downright erased. In the same way that few modern US History textbooks actually discuss in great detail the pre-Western-contact societies and histories that existed on the North American continent, I feel as if a similar erasure has happened about native Hawaiian peoples, outside of Hawaii itself.

Now on the one hand, why should mainland Americans care about a culture that is not from the mainland? I can't give you a good answer - maybe they shouldn't. Technically, Hawaii isn't part of the North American continent, and while it's politically part of the US, I guess there's no other good reason to care about it, other than I guess general curiosity or empathy for various world cultures.

But, I'd like to posit that implicit on admitting Hawaii as a state in the union, it kind of deserves the respect of the country as having had a history before 1959, in the same way that I feel (and I would hope most of you would agree) that the native peoples of North America deserve to have an acknowledged history prior to the 1600s or so. (And forgive me, because I'm a true product of that - I know very little about this history, which saddens me greatly).

So yeah, that's a big tangent. Where it comes back, simply, is that I feel very, very erased, especially by terminology. The contentious word, really, is ""Hawaiian"" itself. Amongst residents of Hawaii and people of native Hawaiian decent, the word ""Hawaiian"" specifically refers to people who trace ethnic lines to the native peoples of Hawaii. 

And hopefully you see the conflict here. It is my understanding and experience that things and people from Hawaii, regardless of their ethnic background or cultural relation to native people, is referred to ubiquitously as ""Hawaiian"". And of course - that's what people call it, right? So I have to live with it.

Again, I posit - just because one group of people traditionally referred to people of African heritage as [n-slur](/trigger), it of course does not mean that they have to tolerate a name appropriated upon them by an oppressing group. But, the conflict here is that it's not nearly as clear, in the case of the term ""Hawaiian"", that the usage is oppressive. In my experience, it is borne more than anything out of ignorance. And while ignorance doesn't make it right, ignorance is not malice, so it's an imperfect comparison at best. 

Yet at the same time, the appropriation does, to me, have at least some meaning in oppression. Appropriation by non-Hawaiians of non-Hawaiian cultural items or icons as being analogous to, or part of, a specific cultural tradition necessarily erases the validity of that tradition. Any tradition that is based more on myth and stereotype than fact renders that tradition less valid in society. In other words, I feel as if Hawaiian culture ""means less"" to the average non-Hawaiian by virtue of the fact that the only knowledge anyone has of it is generally speaking things that aren't even a part of the original, pre-contact culture -- as if that culture never existed or isn't worth talking about. And coming from the one place where, obviously, that wasn't cool or okay... it's shocking and upsetting to me.

I was raised to be very proud of my Hawaiian heritage (and proud of every other part of my mixed heritage, too). And every kid who is educated in Hawaii, public school or private, will have taken at least one or two Hawaiian studies or culture classes, regardless of heritage, because it's the heritage of the place. And while I'm not suggesting that any other part of the world has a duty to study the culture of any and every other place in the world (that's impractical at best, obviously), it seems to me that erasing it off of the consciousness of the rest of the country - the country whose taxes we pay and to whom we owe national allegiance - is still a little unnecessary, especially when so often its existence is replaced with untrue and often imperialistic stereotypes.

I'm sorry this was so long. If you actually read it, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I'm not sure what I hope to achieve, other than hopefully gaining a perspective I haven't had before, or maybe a little comfort that I'm not alone. I know this is not the only group that suffers from this problem, and I hope that maybe I can empathize better with other groups through sharing and understanding this specific context as it applies to me.

So when I'm with them, I listen to country music too. Sure most of the songs are cheesy and they all use the same chords but there's something about them that just makes me love them to death. It wasn't until recently that I realized that it was because there seems to be a base level of respect for women in these songs that I just don't see in rock or rap music with comparable airtime. In country music, by both male and female artists:

- Women are depicted enjoying sex and wanting sex

- When men talk about women that they love, they don't just mention their appearance but what they do and who they are as people. Mainstream rock songs tend to focus on how much the man is in love with the woman (lots of ""I love you's,"" ""I want yous"" etc) but they never really focus on the why besides perhaps a line or two about how the girl looks. Meanwhile country songs will be about some sort of good time that the couple had together (like, ""I love that time we went fishing and we took off our clothes and swam in the river"" or something). The listener understands more about who the woman is, and she seems more human. 

- More of the songs are about couples in long term relationships which means that the relationships depicted are more nuanced. There are more songs about couples doing day to day mundane things or coping with hardships, or making up after fights. There are also more songs about young people wanting to get married and grow old together.  

- Women have been and are much more influential in country music than in other genres. This means that there is a female perspective in country music that is generally absent from our male dominated mainstream media as a whole.

It does feel good listening to a song about two people in love, knowing why they are in love, and also knowing that the woman in that relationship enjoys sex and is respected. 

I don't feel that way when I listen to mainstream rock songs, especially metal, even though that is my favorite genre of music otherwise. There was one song by Ludo that made me feel so angry that I could not listen to that band in general for a really long time after it came out ([here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUw-V0GPvQU&amp;ob=av2e) if you care. It's pretty much redditry in music form.) 

Yet I also wonder if this is actually because there women are respected more in the culture where the music comes from than we are in, say, the sort of geek rock culture that Ludo comes from. 

Country music comes from the church going, guns, beer and Jesus, socially conservative culture that all American SRSters are familiar with. That culture has also bread some of the most anti-feminist politicians in the Western world as well as a noxious brand of homophobia that is driving gay teenagers all over the country to suicide. This could also explain why the love in country music is generally between couples. They do not deplore the superficial sexualization and objectification of women in pop culture for the same reason that feminists do but because they consider promiscuity outside of marriage to be sinful. You see plenty of couples enjoying sex but women enjoying sex outside of a relationship are noticeably absent. Non gender conforming couples including queer couples are also not depicted. 

So what do you end up with? **Much of the sexism in both pop culture and ""geek"" culture is hostile sexism.** Men write most of the stories, and most of them are about men with the exception of the occasional token chick. Women, if they are there, are heavily sexualized. In sexual works, women are not generally shown enjoying sex, and degrading sex is considered to be a turn-on. Meanwhile, women that do want to participate are called attention whores, and female creators receive gendered slurs and are held to much higher standards than their male counterparts. This is the type of sexism generally shown in mainstream American culture, as well as in ""geek"" culture that reddit occupies.  

**Meanwhile, the sexism in the culture that country music comes from is more of the benevolent variety. The women that conform are treated with respect while non-conforming women are shunned.**

I think that the difference between the hostile and benevolent sexism explains why so many conservative women dislike feminism. I think that it is difficult for many people, liberal and conservative, to imagine a world where people are promiscuous and women are respected. The cultural meme that a woman's power is tied to her ability to withhold sex from a man leads to the idea that women have no power in a sexually promiscuous culture. If people are kept in this box, we end up in pissing contests between liberals who claim to be feminist and conservatives about which is the lesser of the two evils. 

Within this context, it makes sense that conservative women hold their ground. They see it as a choice is between a culture where sex outside of marriage is looked down upon but all people (all ""normal"" people anyway) can have a stable relationship with someone that they love and between a culture where men can have sex with whoever they want, have children out of wedlock, and then abandon them for another woman, and they blame feminism for women who are in that other predicament. If that line of reasoning seems familiar to you all, it's because we've all heard it from the mouths of female MRA's, girlwriteswhat in particular. 

So I guess my point of discussion is whether there is a notion of benevolent sexism tied into conservative culture in the United States (and Canada for that matter, GWW is from Alberta after all), whether or not this is any ""better"" than the hostile sexism we've all grown to know and love on reddit and in other areas of life, and what the reality is for many women, particularly working class women in America who feel like they have to choose between two equally perilous lifestyles, and how feminism views them. 

Discuss away!   

**TL;DR: See the bolded points.**

**EDIT:** Another point of discussion that I just thought of is how SA in a way proposed a tentative alliance with social conservatives when it considered alerting church groups to the dangers of reddit. Does this suggest that, when push comes to shove, SRSers do think more highly of American social conservatives than they do redditors?

So, Laura Bates is a pretty great woman. She got fed up with casual sexism and decided to do something about it.

I felt like I effectively argued for it. That if someone says they won't date a certain race, or says they are unattracted to a certain race, then that belief is a racist belief.

I argued that those preferences were the result of cultural upbringing and how the environment interacted with the brain, and whether or not these choices are fully conscious or voluntary, that excluding people based on race is racist. I never tried to demonize people who had these biases (as I likely have them as well, to some extent) but that it benefits us to simply be aware that they exist.

The term 'racism' is obviously culturally charged, so I understand why people were not receiving my arguments very well. However, I felt like I explained the belief quite clearly, but that people were saying that because it's an unconscious, 'personal preference' that it can't be racist.

Also, one thing I found a bit hard to respond to was the ""Is it sexist if a hererosexual woman doesn't date women""? I thought the parallels between sexual/gender attraction and race were really too thin to make a comparison like that, and it seemed very disingenuous.

Now, just so we're straight here...this comment was made in a thread specifically designed for discussion of sexual preferences. This wasn't said by someone in response to a non-sexual photo, no one underage is involved, it didn't just come out of left field in a totally inappropriate time. The question was posed, ""what is a weird thing about the opposite sex that you find attractive,"" and the quote that made it to SRS Prime is just part of a discussion about preferences about height (which, granted, isn't very weird, but that's hardly the complaint here). 

What I'm seeing in the SRS thread is a bunch of people projecting all kinds of crap on this guy and acting like he's a shitlord because he used sexually suggestive language and has a preference for petite girls *in a sexually suggestive thread*. 

&gt;Ugh, I find this disturbing because its so close to what some assholes say to me on the street. It's incredibly intimidating.

Ok...but this isn't on the street, and this didn't come out of nowhere. If someone just says this to you, that is shitty. If someone is asked what they find attractive about the opposite sex and they make a sexualized response, that's not shitty. 

&gt;Also, I had one man once tell me that because I am small I would fold up nicely in a trunk.

Wow. Mega-creepy for sure...but not even close to what this guy said. 

&gt;What you see here is men that percieve themselves as having no power wanting a woman they can feel powerful over. Sick.

Let me introduce you to power play fantasies... Some people want to be dominant in sex, some want to be submissive. You don't have to like it, and as long it's not expressed in inappropriate times/contexts, I don't think there's any conceivable reason for you to be offended by it.

That's a fine personal preference. But again, there are people who don't share it, and that doesn't make them shitlords.

For once, this discussion is happening in an appropriate place and we're still throwing a shitfit? What the hell SRS? Why is this guy a creep? Why is he being shamed?

If you're using ""trashy"" to refer to a group's or person's sexual choices, just don't use it because that's none of your business to judge.

Comments/PMs on style and clarity would be greatly appreciated.
________
**Morality and Justice**

Libertarianism is a theory of justice, not morality. It can be hard to distinguish between these two topics, but some examples make it clearer at first pass. What is moral is what we should do, and what is immoral is what we shouldn’t. Normally, it’s wrong to lie or cut someone in line at the supermarket, but we only call these actions unjust in very particular situations. Or, I can cut off contact from a friend for a few weeks, leading them to believe they have wronged me in some way. In truth, they haven’t done anything of the sort; I take a perverse pleasure from hearing about their distress from our mutual friends. This is immoral and even unfair, but it is natural to say that it is not unjust. There are a couple of ways to get at the distinction (though I do not deny that there might be others). 

First, justice is closely tied to rights. We can even offer a definition, sort of: A just action is one that respects rights, an unjust action violates rights. Similarly, an unjust society has institutions that violate rights, a just society’s institutions respect or protect them. I think that one could argue for this point, but it does not seem to be contentious so I won’t waste everyone’s time (note: Virtue Ethics recognizes a virtue called “justice” and they can do it without rights, but this differs from common understandings of justice). At any rate, historically and contemporarily, the two notions have been tied together in this way. People who believe that redistribution is just often argue that there is a right to equal opportunity or social equality.

Occasionally, we see someone defend an action of theirs by saying that they were acting within their rights. We can concede the point, but go on to say that they shouldn’t have done it; their action was unkind or dishonest or something. “I was within my rights” is a bad moral defense; it is practically an admission of wrongdoing. This points to a difference between what is just and what is moral.

Second, we can understand a theory of justice as a theory about moral enforceability. If an action is unjust, we are morally permitted to use force to ensure that it doesn’t happen or that it is rectified. Murder is not only wrong, it’s unjust, and we are permitted (if not required) to use force to prevent murders. Callously refusing to call my mommy (love ya!) on Mother’s Day is immoral, but no one thinks I should go to prison or be restrained in any way until I make the call. The link between justice and enforceability will ultimately have to be argued for: anarchists and extreme pacifists hold that there could be no such connection. This is the basis for John Locke’s libertarian social contract. I won’t be arguing that there is such a link in this post, but I want to note that most people believe that there is a relationship between rights and enforceability, and it’s helpful in illustrating the difference between justice and morality.

With justice and morality distinguished, it is easier to make sense of the claim that libertarianism is a theory of justice, not goodness. This can be seen another way by looking at the contexts in which these two issues are discussed. Moral philosophy and political philosophy are different but closely related fields. People who argue for libertarianism, socialism, or other forms of government tend not to discuss the differences between the different moral theories. In fact, libertarianism, socialism, and the others are all compatible with the Big Three moral theories: deontology, virtue ethics, and consequentialism (at least that’s how it looks. This seems like an interesting question to me, but I couldn’t find anything in the literature).
______________

**Libertarianism**

The question libertarianism tries to answer, then, is “Which actions are just?” Or, to put it another way, “What are our rights?”.

*What are Rights?*

Libertarianism is most at home with, and gets most of its support from, a status-based or natural rights theory. This family of theories holds that there is something special about being a person in virtue of which we have rights. This might be personal dignity or the intrinsic value of each person or something like that. When somebody commits an affront to this dignity or value, they have violated a person’s rights. Natural rights theorists have a lot of work to do in making sense of the notion of personal dignity or intrinsic value. We have to avoid Jeremy Bentham’s protest that natural rights are “nonsense upon stilts”.

If rights are natural, then it seems that the difference between an immoral action and an unjust one is a difference of kind, not degree because an action either offends the intrinsic value of a person or it doesn’t. On this picture, it is hard to argue that institutionalized immorality is unjust if that action would not be unjust in a social vacuum. Institutionalization seems to be a matter of degree; there is no “magic number” of institutionalization at which point it offends dignity. Non-libertarians have to argue for an asymmetry. Arguments for libertarianism trade on the qualitative difference between justice and morality. I think this is a difference that one can believe in without undue privilege. If you’d like to talk more about this, please PM me.

Natural rights theories are among the most popular accounts of rights. The other main accounts of the source of rights are consequential or instrumental and contractual.

* Instrumental theories say that rights are an instrument for some goal. Instrumental accounts are thought to give rise to rights that are too weak and are charged with letting the ends justify the means. We have the rights we do because enforcing *these* rules (and not others) is the best way to bring about some end. So if the end could be better served by killing someone, there’s no reason not to do it. Note, this is a concern whether the end is utility or equality. Instrumentalists also have to explain why their chosen goal is worth enforcing in a way that doesn’t become status-based. Along with natural rights, instrumental rights are the most popular among philosophers.

* Contractual theories can be found in John Rawls and Thomas Scanlon. On a contractual account, we have the rights we do because a certain group of people would agree to respect these rights. Their agreeing to respect these rights is supposed to give *us* a reason to. Contractual theories are unpopular. Philosophers object that the group’s agreement (for Rawls, people in the initial position, for Scanlon, ideally reasonable people) cannot really give us a reason to act unless there are already natural or instrumental rights there to provide the reason.

*What are Our Rights?*

Libertarians argue that rights are very limited. You have a right to self-ownership or autonomy and you have a right to obtain and hold property. These should both be understood as forms of control over the thing in question. If we accept the relationship between justice and enforcement, then people are permitted to use force to protect their control. Libertarians think that being in control of yourself requires that you and you alone embark on “uses” of yourself or uses of your property. When someone else can make demands on the “uses” of you or the uses of your property, this is because you have already entered yourself into an obligation to them. This is the case when we promise or contract, and no one can make a promise or sign a contract on your behalf unless you have already given them permission to do so.

* Autonomy

Everyone who believes in rights believes that autonomy is one, and that as long as it does not interfere with another’s rights, everyone should be free to exercise their autonomy. Whether you believe in redistribution or not, respect for autonomy is at the core of rights talk; some arguments for equal opportunity try to establish that the social, political, and economic barriers oppressed groups face constitute affronts to their autonomy. Libertarians respond that their notion of control is too strong and leads to bad consequences. There is no principled distinction that licenses Affirmative Action, say, but not other illegitimate forms of government interference. Since there is no principled difference, they are both illegitimate. The challenge for the egalitarian is to establish how illegitimate taxation does, but Affirmative Action does not, impede autonomy. This is very near the dispute over [positive and negative freedoms]( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/). (You won’t find a resolution to the debate there, but there are references and plenty of discussion)

* Property

The libertarian understanding of property is descended from John Locke’s discussion. He famously held that in order for someone to acquire a piece of property, they have to mix their labor with it in the appropriate way. A shepherd comes to own the sheep (assuming for sake of the example that animals can be owned) and the pasture by planting grass seeds, building a fence around the area, and tending to the sheep. When a person mixes their blood, sweat, and tears with an unowned thing, they extend their autonomy into it. It becomes a part of their personhood, in a way. If a person does something to an owner’s property against their will, they have offended against that person’s autonomy since it was partially “in” that item. The best way to understand how “extended autonomy” works is on analogy with [extended minds]( http://philpapers.org/browse/the-extended-mind/), the idea that we can move many of our mental processes outside of our heads. I think this also answers [a recent SRSD challenge to property rights]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/wkllc/capitalist_property_rights_are_not_natural/). (Incidentally, I think the poster misunderstands the nature of the social contract and what natural rights are)

Robert Nozick has pointed out a serious problem with acquisition as mixing of labor. If I own a can of tomato juice and spill it into the sea, I lose my tomato juice. I don’t come to own the sea. But I have mixed my labor with the sea! People who believe in private property (whether they are libertarians or not) have to give a non *ad hoc* account of “mixing labor” that avoids this consequence.

Another problem comes from Locke himself. If I own some land, I can hire people to work it for me. They mix their labor with the land, but I still own the land and its produce. Why doesn’t their labor push my autonomy out and replace it with theirs? Or, to put it another way, how can labor be rightfully alienated?

These two objections are powerful, but they may be answerable (and I have my own opinions about how best to do it). Believers in private property (remember, most people who support redistribution believe in *some* private property rights) can still fine-tune their theories and give a good account of property. The libertarian leaves us with a promissory note to provide a good theory in the future. Loren Lomasky’s 1987 *Persons, Rights, and the Moral Community* and Hillel Steiner’s 1981 liberty and equality are both attempts to cash this note in.

There are also special concerns having to do with [intellectual property](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/). A libertarian can, in consistency, reject intellectual property rights by holding that it is impossible to mix one’s labor with an idea in the appropriate way.

________________
**Left- and Right-Libertarianism**

When thinking about property, libertarians splits off into two branches depending on how they conceive of natural resource acquisition. Right-libertarians believe that nature is initially unowned. When someone mixes their labor with it, they come to have full control over it. Radical right-libertarians believe that there are no constraints on resource acquisition, though most libertarians subscribe to the Lockean proviso in some form or another. The Lockean proviso holds that natural resources can be appropriated as long as enough and as good is left for others. Nozick, the paradigmatic right-libertarian, interprets this to mean that no one should be left worse off by resource acquisition than they would have been had the resource been left alone.

Left-libertarians, on the other hand, believe that we all have a claim on the natural resources in some way. Some of them interpret the Lockean proviso to say that we all have an equal share of natural resources, and any acquisition beyond that equal share must be compensated. Others think that any resource acquisition whatsoever must be compensated. For more interpretations of the Lockean proviso and more on the distinction between left- and right-libertarianism, see the [SEP entry on libertarianism]( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/).

____________
**Libertarianism and Social Justice**

We have seen that libertarians have a very limited conception of rights, but they are free to have as extensive a theory of morality as anyone else. It is open to the libertarian to recognize that there are social structures that give unearned advantages to members of social groups by virtue of the power of that group. So, libertarianism is not inconsistent with privilege.

Libertarians should also admit that, historically, certain groups have been put at a disadvantage and that current social structures perpetuate that disadvantage. For reasons that everyone else does, libertarians should recognize that these structures are immoral and deeply so. They can and should work to bring an end to these institutions. However, because they do not believe in rights to equal opportunity or social equality, libertarians cannot say that these institutions are unjust. Moreover, taking injustice as the condition for enforceability, libertarians cannot force others to stop perpetuating the institutions. Libertarianism provides no grounds to object to social justice as an idea, it only bars us from calling the movement social *justice* and constrains the methods we can use to right the wrongs.

It is vital to remember that many libertarians *do* deny that privilege or these immoral social structures exist. Their belief in libertarianism surely bolsters this further belief (causally), but it is not evidence for it. The reasons to believe in privilege and immoral social structures are independent of the reasons to believe in libertarianism. Denial that privilege exists (and similar beliefs) is a failure of rationality on the part of that specific libertarian, not a failure of the theory. *To the extent that, as a matter of fact, belief in libertarianism leads to denial of social inequality, libertarianism is a dangerous theory.* This doesn’t mean that libertarianism is false: people used Darwinian evolution to support eugenics, but that doesn’t mean that Darwin was wrong. 

A libertarian who is against social justice activism that does not involve legislation misapplies the theory. Libertarians should do everything in their power, short of force, to end social inequality.

From what I can tell, it's mostly survival sex work, as the women look like they're having a rather rough time of it.

This morning, I left my apartment to get some coffee from the cafe across the street.  As I was waiting, a woman who was clearly high, maybe even in the throws of drug induced psychosis, was having a meltdown in front of my apartment block.  She was opening mailboxes, slamming the complex gate, trying to open car doors.  She was screaming at the cafe patrons to ""Quit fucking staring"" and telling them that she'd ""Fuck them up if they didn't fuck off"" and the like.

My first thought was ""Oh man, I don't want to deal with this.""  I had a bit of a hangover and just wanted to get my coffee and slob around on my laptop.  

I realized that my theoretical compassion actually didn't translate practically, and I felt pretty shitty.  I understand that this woman clearly had bigger problems in her life than wanting to surf the net with a $5 coffee, but in that moment I was faced with the reality that understanding her disenfranchisement didn't stop me from being annoyed that she was banging around my apartment block and screaming at cafe patrons.

Benign activities bogged down with comments ranging from judgments about her character based on her appearance, ratings on how do-able she is, criticisms of the activity she's involved in, and so on.

Also in more than one place, I've heard it mentioned that the harassment and criticism would be avoided is brought on by the women themselves! Its not just the fact that [they're obviously going out of their way to appear in the pictures](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/vfcqv/sick_of_the_girl_in_front_of_object_comic_strip/), but [that they should have *known* that pictures you post on Reddit or Facebook can fall into the wrong hands and be abused.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/vsviw/hot_chick_facebook_profile_pic_evolution/c57em44)

For example, the most memorable to me is the Fire Bubbles incident, where [this girl](http://www.redditpics.com/set-bubbles-in-our-hand-on-fire-in-class-yes-that,832077/) shared a picture from her science class, and within a few hours had her personal information posted by some super-awesome internet detective, along with some veiled threat of ""yeah, we're gonna find you, little girl."" A mod took down the post, but no bans or punishment followed.

Probably the most infuriating reaction I heard out of the whole thing was the fact that the girl was somehow to blame for her harassment. She should have known that Reddit was a hive of scum and villany. She should have expected this kind of reaction for being an attractive female. She should have known that some image hosts don't remove exif data from your uploads, and that things can be easily traced back to you.

When I hear someone go on about how the internet is a dangerous place and women could just avoid harassment if they did x or y differently, I want to barf.

1339316968.0,49,self.SRSDiscussion,uue3x,[Effort] Crime and Poverty in Black and White,BZenMojo,61,12,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/uue3x/effort_crime_and_poverty_in_black_and_white/,"Aka, ""Why Reddit needs to shut the fuck up because it really has no idea what it's talking about on the subjects of race, crime, OR poverty.""

------------------

First, the chase.  The ratio of black crime to white crime in the NCVS is **2.23 to 1**.  The ratio of black poverty to white poverty in the US Census is **2.73 to 1**.  2.23 is smaller than 2.73.  (This is important.  Moving on...)

Frequently, the [relationship between crime and poverty](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime&amp;Inequality.pdf) is brought up to explain the disparity in reported crime between ethnic and racial groups.  This seems to make sense: poor people have a lot of pressures that drive them toward anti-social behavior that would otherwise be non-existent for those with money, power, and education.

An increasingly common counter to this is that, ""Well, that's just not true.  Adjusted for poverty levels there is still a huge difference.""

I used to stare at this cross-eyed and wonder where this mysterious study was done.  I would even retort, ""[citation needed]"" as if racists need citations to get upvotes.  Also, a couple of points to consider:

1) How do you do a study like this?  Do you interview victims and ask them how expensive their robber's watch looked at gunpoint?  Do you interview convicts and ask them their employment status and net worth?  Do you ask what kind of car the guy who carjacked you was driving before he jumped out and traded with you?

2) Where do you get your samples from?  The Bureau of Justice's NCVS does thousands upon thousands of interviews with people around the country.  Meanwhile, the FBI's UCR has voluntary reporting from police districts based solely off of arrest numbers.  And these are the two most reliable collections available.

So, never getting a response I figured, ""How poorly considered an adventure would it be to try it myself?""

So...here goes.

------------------

**A Comparative Study of Crime by (Black and White) Race and a Correlative Analysis of Poverty...**

^...With ^some ^3rd ^Grade ^Math ^On ^Top....

--------------------

The goal of this effortpost is to establish some way of quantifying the correlation between crime and poverty among blacks and whites to address the use of this comparison in Reddit discourse.  My first step in this goal is to establish a series of ratios that can be assigned to blacks and whites based off the analysis of statistically valid numbers.  In this first instance, I used the [NCVS numbers for violent crime rates based on race (Table42)](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus08.pdf)

Using these and the equivalent racial definitions from the US Census categories, I compared national black and white racial groups in their criminality.  To represent this, I calculated a ratio between their represented proportion of crimes and their represented proportion of the entire population.

 |[White, Single Race](http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-05.pdf) (72.4%)| [Black, Single Race](http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-06.pdf) (12.6%)| Other | Not Known|
:--:|:--:|:--: | :--: | :--:
Violent Crime Rates | 58.4% | 22.8% |6.7% | 12.1%

* What I came up with was a ""*criminality ratio*.""  To put it in perspective, one would expect a race that is 50% of the population and 50% of crimes committed to have a criminality ratio of 1:1, or 1 = proportional representation.

 |White| Black| 
:--:|:--:|:--: |
**Criminality Ratio** |0.81| 1.81

* The black population is identified as violent crime offenders at a rate **2.23** times that of whites.

 |White | Black | 
:--:|:--:|:--:
[**Census Bureau Poverty Rates**](http://www.infoplease.com/business/economy/2010-census-poverty.html) | 9.9% |27%

* The black population is impoverished at a rate of **2.73** times that of whites.  To control *only* for the level of poverty, find the ratios of poverty and crime between black and white populations.

* **Relative Ratio of Violent Crime to Poverty Among Racial Groups**

    (Criminality Ratio/% Poverty)

 |White|Black|
:--:|:--:|:--:
Violent Crime/Poverty | .081 | .067

So the first thing discovered is that, adjusted for those vaunted poverty rates, black people are actually less likely to commit crime than white people.  **82.7%** as likely, to be precise.

**Note 1:** *76% of all crimes are single-offender crimes (Table 37)*
-----

**zxquarx** notes that [you can't get exact numbers](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/uue3x/effort_crime_and_poverty_in_black_and_white/c4yn0as) from this calculation.  I try to address this and with the addendum below.

-----

*Addendum 6/10 2:05 PM PST*: Note well that this assumes that people above the poverty line commit crimes at the same rate regardless of wealth.  While there is documented correlation between poverty and crime rates, there is as yet neither a documented correlation between wealth and crime rates nor evidence of racial or ethnic influence on crime rates.  The numbers provided show merely that it is *possible* that all crime disparity disappears with poverty.  This shifts the burden of proof to racial and ethnic essentialists who lack evidence or an angle of approach.

----------------------------------------

Although, if you want to base it on actual household net worth, the numbers change drastically.  If in this case net worth is measured as an inverse measure of gross poverty:

[**Pew Research Center Poll on Household Net Worth**](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealth-gaps-rise-to-record-highs-between-whites-blacks-hispanics/)

 |White | Black | 
:--:|:--:|:--:
Household Net Worth in $k | 113 | 5.6

Then you can calculate the relationship so: **Relative Ratio of Violent Crime to Household Net Worth Among Racial Groups** (Household Net Worth in $/Relative Violent Crime Rate).

 |White|Black|
:--:|:--:|:--:
NetWorth/Crime Ratio | 11.41 | 0.21

So, dollar for dollar, black people are only **1/54th** as likely to commit violent crime as white people controlling for Net Worth alone.  However, we're talking specifically about poverty and the Fortune 500 otherwise skews the numbers against whites as a group.

---------------------

I went ahead and used the [UCR arrest rates by race](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/table-43/10tbl43a.xls) although I have misgivings about it which I will discuss in the notes below.  For those of you unfamiliar, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports uses self-reported data on arrests from districts across the country.  In a multiple-crime arrest it only counts the highest crime.  Reporting is completely voluntary.  And it ignores prosecutions and convictions.

 |[White, Single Race](http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-05.pdf) (72.4%)| [Black, Single Race](http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-06.pdf) (12.6%)| 
:--:|:--:|:--: | 
All Arrest Rates | 69.4% | 28% |
Violent Crime Arrest Rates | 59.3% | 38.1% |
Property Crime Arrest Rates | 68.4% | 28.9% |

* **Arrest Likelihood Ratios**

 |White| Black| 
:--:|:--:|:--: |
Arrest Likelihood Ratio |0.96| 2.22
Violent Crime Arrest Likelihood Ratio |0.82| 3.02
Property Crime Arrest Likelihood Ratio |0.94| 2.29

* **Relative Ratios of Arrests to Poverty** (Arrest Rate/% Poverty)

 |White|Black|
:--:|:--:|:--:
All Arrests/Poverty | .097 | .082
All Violent Crime Arrests/Poverty | .083 | .112
All Property Crime Arrests/Poverty | .095 | .084

Even using arrest rates reported voluntarily by the police in the UCR, there's a noticeable trend with overall crime.  Blacks as a group scale lower with regard to poverty rates than whites do.  The exception to this is violent crime, but I address that anomaly in the note below.

The fact remains, observing relative poverty rates and statistics on criminal reporting by race, the only argument in which black people *adjusted for poverty* still show high levels of criminality is in the case of *reported arrests for violent crimes.*  In identification by victims of violent crime and in statistics for other categories of crime including both arrests and self-reports by victims, this is not the case.

------------------------------

**Note 2:** Despite being the most comprehensive study of its kind, the NCVS relies on perceived racial identifications for offenders.  But unlike the [FBI's Uniform Crime Reports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Crime_Reports#Criticisms_of_statistical_validity), it uses victim statements.  This ameliorates the documented racial bias in [arrest rates](http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/arresting-blacks-marijuana-california-possession-arrests-2006-08) and [stop-and-frisks](http://www.nyclu.org/news/nyclu-analysis-reveals-nypd-street-stops-soar-600-over-course-of-bloomberg-administration) which are the *sole sources* for the FBI's statistics.

**Note 3:** The NCVS and UCR seem to have insignificant disparity between white violent crime reported and arrest rates.  1.5% difference to be precise.  However, the UCR's reported arrest rates for black violent crime are actually **67% higher** than violent offenders cited in the NCVS.  Furthermore, the UCR shows comparable arrest rates between property crime and all crimes for whites and blacks (all crimes is not an average of property and violent crime).  However, it reports much, much higher violent crime arrest rates for blacks and much, much lower violent crime arrest rates for whites.

-----------

I'm sure someone good at Calculus could come up with better nomenclatures for comparing rates with each other.

The top replies to these comments were in many cases things along the lines of ""this don't real, stop saying it"", and in some cases the dissenters were threatened with bans. I think this response is somewhat problematic.

I'm female, and I'm in my first romantic/sexual relationship, with a male for whom it is also his first romantic/sexual relationship. Everything we do sexually is new to both of us, so there is a lot of exploring of boundaries and actively figuring out and redefining what we are comfortable with. We were making out recently when I put my hands inside his pants. He had said something previously that made me think this would be ok, but I did not ask if he was comfortable with it beforehand. He didn't object, and I thought nothing of it. But a few days later, he told me it had really made him uncomfortable and that it upset him that I didn't ask explicitly before doing that. 

I have been feeling terrible about it since - I am furious with myself for failing to do one of the most important parts of enthusiastic consent: continuously checking in with my partner and making sure that enthusiastic consent is still there. I wasn't attentive to his feelings, and I made him feel violated. That is a big deal, and it does ""real"". One of my responses has been to think about why it was that I had thought it was ok at the time to cross that boundary without asking. As the female in the relationship, I think I tend to assume, whether subconsciously or consciously, that he is likely to want to do more sexually than I am and that my comfort level is likely to be the limiting factor. One implication of this is that I did not place sufficiently high importance on actively establishing enthusiastic consent - when I hear feminists talk about enthusiastic consent, I typically think of it as a message primarily directed at men, and I guess I hadn't internalized it as much as I needed to. So when I saw the dominant sentiment in this thread chanting that my wrongdoing ""don't real"", it bothered me - what I did was very wrong, and I should be vocally criticized for it. My being female should not make me immune to these criticisms.

Yes, rape culture is rooted in patriarchy and sexism, but I don't think it's appropriate to just shut down the idea that women need to establish enthusiastic consent too. Is there a way to emphasize that it's something women need to pay attention to too without being patriarchal/sexist?

For those who don't know, Deen has been repeatedly using the n-word on set, and I assume she's generally making racist remarks. I assume this because a few weeks ago she was in the news for wanting to dress POC up as slaves to serve people food during a civil war reenactment dinner. Uggggh.

I'm just so annoyed because so many of these comments are making a joke of the situation, blaming the victims, or writing stuff off. And this is Buzzfeed, which from what I see of the site is that it generally has progressive content.

The first top comment I agree with:
&gt;I hate when racists apologize for being racist. It's the way you feel - you can't just say sorry and magically NOT feel the way you do. F** her.

But it's met with a lot of criticism, basically ""well she can change her ways"" and all that crap.

The second top comment:
&gt;That apology needed more butter.

Sure, lets make jokes out of this! And then we have all kinds of gold:

&gt;we all have done and said things we regret. I think we all need to be forgiven now and then. Paula is human just like the rest of us, she is just in the public eye.

.

&gt;Who amongst us has not used some word that would offend someone these days? NONE! I support her, and try to understand that this a woman from the deep south raised at a time when the Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Funny we dance around the ""N"" word but nothing else. WHY? Be adult and discuss it in a respectful manner, not like we are little children.

.
&gt;How would some of you like a Black person coming up to you saying “What’s up poor White trash” You will most likely be offended and label them as racist. But it is acceptable for a white person to call another White person by the same name without being label a racist. Get the point.

~~What does that even mean?~~
**edit** from /u/thefundontstop, ""wait, that seems good to me. seems to me like they're explaining to people (or trying to) that just because black people use the n-word doesn't mean it's okay for white people to.""

&gt;So i should start suing every rap star i hear using the “N” word? Sounds to me like someone who just wants a piece of all the money she has.

That quote exists in several hundred iterations.

And I don't even want to start on all the people coming to her defence on the Food Network website. Or the people who somehow find it relevant to bring Obama into the topic of conversation.

Sometimes it just floors me that people are so racist and don't understand. It also really upsets me when people try to silence victims by telling them to ""get over it."" You have every right to be angry and upset about the situation.

Second of all. The term PoC or ""opressed people"" includes everyone from asians to latinos to indian to blacks.  That alone I have a bit of a problem with as these people don't have the same experiences.  I've never heard or driving while asian or indian college students being profiled and searched by American police while walking home.  That's not to say that these people do not face prejudice and stereotypes in their own ways, but I just think it's different, far different from American blacks at least. 

The other thing I have a problem with is that if all of these people by virtue of being a certain race that has been historically marginalized can be categorized as ""oppressed"" Is the thousands of years of oppression that jews have faced ""not enough""?

The Ironic thing is that I hear from tumblr leftists and SRS folks the same type of derailing tactics you'd expect from stormfront or whiterights.  ""Jews are not a race.""  While technically this may be the case Jews can often be identified by facial features and skin tone. I myself am labeled as a Jew whether I want to be or not.  Furthermore anti-semitism has played out in a way that is pretty much identical to racism.  With people being mistreated for being born to the wrong parents or looking the wrong way (Nazi racial science was heavily influenced by the same racial science used to justify slavery and classify various ethnic groups in Africa during imperialism) So for people who claim to be ""anti-racist"" to sweep that under the rug is very discouraging to say the least. 

Anyway, downvote, ban do whatever. I agree with most of the stuff on this board but I can't help but feel very left out.

I'm sure it's been posted all over reddit, hyped up and glorified as acceptable science, and there's probably a wealth of comments to analyze all over. Take these for example at the at the bottom of the article itself:

""One more science study proving women are more shallow than men.""

""Body and facial hair are defining masculine traits the way women's breasts are feminine traits. Denying or trying to change these facts are ignorant. Who would not want their man to look manly?""

The moderators actually did an OK job deleting inane comments in there.

For the past few decades the burgeoning growth of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology has had more than its share of negative affects. Pop-science magazines have taken evolutionary psychology claims out of context and used them to support and reinforce gender roles and race differences, which in turn get abused to support sexism and racism.

Meanwhile, these depictions are reinforced in the media, which gets digested by WEIRD (White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) college students that are effectively the only population these psychologists use in their studies. And then pop-science abuse these studies and the cycle continues.

The diversity of the original top ten has greatly changed. Every single new entry is a reply to something misogynistic, I suppose we could take from this that in upvoting my replies to these comments reddit realises there is a problem with the way it treats women. The alternative of course being that reddit cares even less about PoC, GSM and their own general shittiness than the first 7 days lead on.

At the time of my Seven Days post two novelties had been created to reply to my posts, this number has increased dramatically.

These accounts aren't really a problem, it's just a lot of mail to ignore, there have been other users who prefer to channel their manger in to direct mail, I'm sure it's seemed the past week that I'm posting something to /r/SRSMailbag everyday.

[A delightful example.](http://i.imgur.com/iuaGc.png)

I could draw from this that their is some kind of madbro conspiracy behind my increasing downvotes, bans and reply novelties but that's all a little /r/SRSMythos and probably giving them far too much credit. In all likelihood it's just because for all intents and purposes this is a novelty account and reddit has a very short attention span, what it saw as a joke, rather than mild disapproval of it's lack of empathy, got old and it started to lash out.

[There have of course been highlights that made everything worth it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMailbag/comments/15gy0l/does_he_hate_me_or_does_he_want_to_date_me/) And having even [just one person](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/151mm7/seven_days_of_decency/c7o52hu?context=3) really think about their use of language and level of empathy on reddit and in the wider world, maybe even consider what /r/ShitRedditSays is with an open mind then at least something, however small, has been accomplished.

As the tone of the whole post and fact I'm not posting on [Human_Decency](http://i.imgur.com/BAjiW.png) may allude to I am pretty much set on retiring the account, I see the most likely future being full of frustration as the number of subreddits I can post in grow smaller and the hatemail I receive grows larger. I would like to thank anyone who's ever replied to my posts in The Fempire, or even just upvoting me, for giving me support and making this easily the most entertaining experience I've had on reddit, I don't kid myself that I have done anything great or noble but thank you all for being a large part of it's inspiration and giving me, if no one else, a lot to think about.

I have a gardener come every couple of weeks depending on the season. I also have a cleaner come once or twice a week to clean the house and do laundry. The only thing I do myself is load and unload the dishwasher.

According to several friends and aquaintances I'm a patriarchal throwback and if I was a decent human being I'd spare other people the chore of cleaning up after me. I try not to mention it because of the negative response I get, like I just admitted to being a plantation owner.

Obviously I don't see it that way. I'm not exploiting people, I pay legal workers a fair wage and am flexible about when and how they do the job. I'm not disabled or elderly, I just really hate housework, and would much rather spend my time earning extra money (i run a construction company) and pay someone else to do it.

I can see that there is maybe some class issues at play here, and maybe racial ones? The gardening company I use is owned by a british ghanian man, and his employees are all black afaik. But I'm not sure how I'm harming anyone, or how doing my own housework and completing fewer buildings would be good for anyone. The response I get from most people is that I just 'don't get it'.

* it feels like it's just one more of those little ways in which trans women are invalidated in feminist spaces

SRSEducation night was a great success! Thanks so much to all our speakers and all those who attended. Beyond a minor low-effort trolling incident at the beginning the conversation was very informative and respectful.

This is just a description. Don't argue about race in the comments please, all such comments will be deleted. If you were there and had any feedback you are welcome to leave them here.

Here is a link to the full logs, the only thing I removed were entry and exit messages, as they were unnecessary and most had IPs: http://privatepaste.com/2854592c08

For those who are not interested in going through 5.5 hours worth of the conversation (although I do recommend you do because it’s *very* informative!) here’s a long tl;dr

Introduction:

The objective was to present to you the perspectives of PoC, starting with an overview of racist past events and continuing into discussion of PoC experiences.

* Nadir of race relations in the United States.
* Reconstruction improved the lives of PoC of all types.
* When support for it was removed PoCs lives got worse.
* Support was removed because of pressure from the white populace in the South and the North.
* The murder of Vincent Chin:
* Vincent Chin was a Detroit student who was due to be married. In 1982, on the night of his bachelor party, he was ambushed and beaten to death by two white men with baseball bats. The two white men were automotive workers. At the time, Japanese (note: *Japanese*) car manufacturers were overtaking the Detroit auto industry. And these two men, in misguided vengeance, went out and beat the first Asian person they saw to *death.* Vincent Chin was not an auto worker. Vincent Chin was not Japanese. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
* The two men were sentenced to 3 years probation and a 3000 dollar fine. The judge was quoted as saying ""These weren't the kind of men you send to jail... You don't make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal.""
* The incident helped to created a Pan-Asian movement of solidarity
* The Vancouver Police and RCMP are in trouble in Canada for basically ignoring the murder of dozens of First Nations women.
* Harper shut down Sisters in Spirit, an organization dedicated to tracking down the hundreds of missing aboriginal women across Canada.
* “Residential schools” for First Nations is a good place to begin looking up Racism in Canada, but TW for the content.
* The most important part of all of this is unified racial movements emerging from these events
* We unite across nationalities and ethnicities because the world is *hostile*.
* That's linked to how racism is defined here, and the definition we use: Prejudice + Power
* Racism as a system that can be reinforced by thoughts, actions, and inactions of everyone. Prejudice sort of implies that you have to actively be malicious against a race, and I want to point out that that definitely doesn't have to be true.

* A great book on Aboriginal oppression in Canada is called Prison of Grass

Race Relations:

* We're really only used to seeing it as white vs. ___, but I think what we should really focus tonight is, how do we as POC sometimes keep each other down, how do we build more solidarity.
* LA  Race Riots of 1992: So to give a bit of an overview, Rodney King was beaten by police, a video was leaked, and that was what sparked the race riots. the problem was that the damage done was largely to the Korean community in Los Angeles at the time, and to complicate issues, a black girl was shot by a Korean store manager who thought she was attempting to steal.
* Part of the reason the riots escalated is because the LAPD didn't see ethnic enclaves or neighborhoods as a priority. They left the city so abandoned that Korean Americans had to form vigilante groups to protect their stores. And it ignored the whole issue about how the Korean Americans were sort of recent immigrants to the area and the black Americans who have lived there for a long time felt that they were taking away economic agency by running all the convenience stores/groceries etc.
* Some of it was justified because black people *were* disenfranchised w/r/t economics. They have always had the short end of the stick when it comes to the nation's wealth. This just compounded it. But a lot of that anger was misdirected toward the Korean community. Especially when you consider the ""perpetual foreigner"" stereotype that Asians have to battle.
* Wen Ho Lee
* ""But EVERYONE'S racist can't you see?!"" Is not an excuse to be racist. 
* The perpetual foreigner stereotype is something so many PoC have to deal with. One of the worst parts of it, is that you're not even comfortable in your own home. Or even in the city you've grown up your entire life, you feel out of place. It's a terrible thing.
* Perpetual foreigner is something that is used by white media and white interests to divide PoC.
* Many white people love the ""prejudice only"" definition of racism, or the dictionary version, because it benefits them to not have to think critically about their actions/words/thoughts. People do not want to think about how something innocuous can affect others, or that they may be doing something racist without realizing it. Saying, “But I’m not affecting overt violence or abuse, so it can’t be racist,” is a derail and perpetuates this idea of racism being only overtly violent actions against PoC.

Beauty standards:

* The ""white"" perspective dominates even our choice of partners, and friends and coworkers, since who we find attractive even influences who we choose to socialize with on any level. Many people, PoC included, when told to envision their ideal mate, will automatically envision someone who is white.
* Basically, the beauty standard in America (that is now arguably international) as it focuses on PoC, specifically those who are black, is based heavily in classism, racism, etcetera. It dictates that to be beautiful, you probably should start off being white. Preferably blond. If not, you should have some measure of Eurocentric features. For example, the reason asian hair is considered ""beautiful"" is because it is straight and full - ""white"" features. That focus is clearly rooted deeply in our history and one way of marginalizing and eliminating black women (and people) throughout history is to other them. The first thing we are 'othered' by is our completely opposing set of features when compared to white people. Especially women.
* “Exotic” is often used to describe PoC who have “white” features; the term implies a fetishization aspect to the beauty of PoC.
* Sarah Baartman is a good example of fetishization.
* Tropes about black women are based in the slave breeding myth and impressions from legends like Sojourner Truth. Strong, stalwart and most of all /desexualized/ black women. And the tropes that come with it. Basically, black women come in only three flavors when it comes to beauty or even just as women. Sapphire, the equivalent to the Asian stereotype ""Dragon lady"" (if you recognize it), Jezebel and Mammy.
* Hair relaxers are commonly used on black women in order to make their hair “like everyone else’s”. It is expensive and damaging to the hair, but many professional settings will require it for “professionalism”. Some places have even tried to ban black women from wearing their hair natural, in dreadlocks or in braids.
* In the 60s and seventies we saw one of the first natural hair movements. That’s when the Afro burst onto the scene. And it was a big deal and not ""Just hair"" because black people’s hair is always relatable to being “uncivilized animals”. Black radicals wore afros for a very obvious reason.
* The Paper Bag test was something used at college sororities or yore. The black ones. A fine example of internalized racism/shadism. Your skin had to match a brown paper bag and be no darker or you couldn’t join. 
* Blue vein societies are a southern -and- a sorority issue and also of not-so-long-ago days of yore. If you weren't light enough to see the bluish tint of your veins, you were out.
* Colourism in the Asian communities has other influences. In china for example, being tan means you work in the fields and are some poor peasant farmer. So the beauty standards there is super pale = good, affluent, rich. With black folks, its means you're prettier somehow. More ""exotic"" or just ""good enough"", commonly, depending on if you're talking to black people or white people. In Hispanic communities it's also tied to nativephobia, and mixed blood Cherokee are given higher status but that's been going on since Andrew Jackson days. Mixed blood Cherokees were all in families of high wealth and prestige

Mixed race:

* Stereotypes about appearance dominate the issue about “how to classify” a person who is mixed race. Commonly, it is only after a racial status is known that someone will treat you differently. This is commonly found in communities where racial stereotypes are usually cultural, such as in Native Americans, rather than based upon visual standards of beauty. If you are biracial and fall on the wrong side of classification, you do get many of the subtle racist comments or actions, such as watching you closer in a store, speaking slightly more slowly to you, asking if you can speak x language, and conflation of many different cultures into one large conglomeration (particularly prevalent with Native Amercians, Hispanic, Asian, and African tribes and cultures). If you fall on the “right” side of classification, you will often hear jokes made about your race that are personally hurtful but difficult to speak out against precisely because you have been pegged as “white”.
* Mixed race, and those who are from communities that are often conflated, don’t have “culture”, they have “history”. It is common that these “cultures” are perpetually made to be pre-modern and shamanic stereotypes are one of those attempts.
* The words Hispanic and even Latino are Anglo and European inventions. Similarly, common names for Native American tribes are heavily anglicized.
* PoC will never be able to claim a real slice of the pie unless they figure out how to build identities that aren't based on internalized white definitions and assumptions. Assumptions like what language(s) you speak, what foods you like, what your hobbies are, all play into this.
* Long before the bracero program or before the mass migration started California relied on ""asian"" labor. Part of bringing in Mexican migrants was because of resentment and hatred of Asian Americans so Mexicans displaced quite a few agriculture workers
and railroad companies, farmers, etc. used it constantly to agitate both communities. Filipinos also have it tough because they often get called Mexicans or Mexicans of Asia and have their identities erased.


Important resources:

* Trail of tears.
* Mexican lynching during reconstruction

Race and Education:

* Basically, people like to pretend that we ended segregation in schools w/ Brown vs. Board and everything in education is now peachy. Schools are actually *more* segregated today than they were 10 years after MLK's assassination. Basically after the courts overturned segregation, they tried for a period to allow bussing and using race as a determinant factor in choosing applicants to schools. The courts eventually turned away from that because they follow a ""strict scrutiny"" philosophy on race, meaning all classifications on race is treated as suspect. They actually think that we need to be rid of race as a classification in 25 years. This is the majority opinion of the supreme court of our land. So now we're not allowed to try and racially balance our schools. The result? Poor black schools with severe neglect. School violence skyrocketing. Poor teachers. Lack of resources. Schools where there's a 40-60% drop-out rate for students of color. This is compounded by factors like school funding, which is tied to residential racial segregation, which is affected by racist laws regarding housing. 
* So, bussing happened a little after Brown vs. Board. Some schools started using race as a factor in deciding who to let into their schools to make the white/non-white ratio more balanced. That kind of resulted in a lot of kids being bussed to different districts far away. There were actually white riots following that, because white parents were horrified that their kids had to be forced to go to school with black children.
* Pedagogy in these mostly black schools is really awful and mostly serve to teach these black/minority children how to follow directions and sit obediently. That way when they graduate they can move on to some minimum wage job that will offer no advancement opportunities. It's really no surprise kids drop out and lose interest in school.
* Education reform in the US is “mostly focused on the ""achievement gap"" and how do we solve the race issue in schools”. Right now the solution is to privatize schools, charter school movements, school ""choice,"" etc. All of these solutions kind of sideline the funding issue of our public schools. There are awesome public schools. They are mostly white.
* Education researchers and academics have tried and tried to get the courts to acknowledge that during the period where we tried bussing, that actually kind of worked. Nothing else since has. And a lot of these ""reforms"" are done under the guise of improving school culture/quality, when really they just want to break up the teacher's unions. We are not saying that there aren't bad teachers out there. There are. However, working in a mostly black school that lacks resources is a completely shit job. Many teachers get no support from administration or the organization TFA, and quit quickly. So the bad teacher trope is largely a myth. There are amazing teachers that work in these schools under impossible conditions. We really need to find a way to support our teachers. And it's not just about shitty teachers, this problem is so much bigger and systemic than that.
* Magnet schools are usually pretty good public schools. The thing with magnet schools is sometimes people of color get sidelined even *within* schools. They put all the white kids in the good magnet program and relegate the ""bad"" kids in the regular program.
* Asians overwhelmingly do better at traditional education, not because they are some sort of test taking supergenius model minority, but because most of the Asians they use as examples for that are middle class. Kids of immigrant families from Asia are usually the top 1-2% from their home countries. Poor Asian communities do not do any better than any other poor minorities.
* There's actually research that shows when a school is racially balanced, that not only do the white kids learn about other cultures and become more aware of social issues, but the minority kids benefited *a lot* from going to a clean, nice school with competent teachers.
* The civil-rights era busing period could be considered analogous to Reconstruction: It seems like things got better when there was active support, and then got worse once that support was removed.
* A lot of people have the misconception that affirmative action actively hurts anti-racism, because it uses racial standards to benefit one race over another. The problem with that interpretation is that it completely ignores the reality of the education landscape today in America, which I just outlined. Education is not an even playing field for most people of color. They're years behind their white peers starting in elementary school. So affirmative action is a (non-perfect) way of addressing that inequity. It acknowledges, ""as a black person you've had to work this much harder to get to where you are today to be on the same footing with this white person."" But it is non-perfect. We don't know how certain institutions like colleges and workplaces implement the policy.

Otherization:

* So imagine the consequences of being told, from the day you can understand it, that you are the ""other"", that you are ""not normal"", that you are ""different."" Because that's something all PoC have to hear. The sentiment in every ""but you're just so x/so not x"" the subtle and unsubtle exclusion from spaces.
* Common things to hear (all are forms of bullying, of referring to race and removing identity):
* An Asian joins a group of people playing a videogame, out come the Asian starcraft jokes.
* An Asian grumbles about their grades with their peers, ""You're Asian though…""
* ""an A in English, lol but you are Mexican!""
* In a literature class, people balking that a Mexican wanted to read an Anglo author and not Sandra Cisneros or Pablo Neruda.
* ""You're OTHER, you have these traits, and these things.""
* ""All A+ Asian"" is really, really shit. You start to think that failures are doubly bad, because you're not supposed to be bad, but if you get an A, well that's just what Asians do so you don't receive recognition for working hard.
* Stereotypes are a double bind. You play into them, and you get criticized for that. You break them, and you get criticized for that. You can't escape it because it's pervasive-the best you can do is stay aware of them and remember that they're affecting your behavior.
* ""generic American"" is a really terrible goal to have. That the problem is not PoC, or their behavior, but the racist power structures that surround us. Nothing PoC do is going to *ever* make them into a generic American - what must be done is to deconstruct the very idea of what ""generic American"" is.

Q&amp;As:

* Q: Are there any positive steps we can take towards that deconstruction? What can we do to help reduce otherisation?

* A: Frankly, the best thing you can do is to believe what PoC say. A lot of it is people letting false constructions of what we are in their heads override what we actually experience and tell people. People literally glossing over my ""I was born in X state, and then I moved to Y state.."" to go ""well yes where re you REALLY FROM"". Esp. about their experiences as PoC. being told your feelings about racism just isn't ""true""  or ""logical"" is really damaging, especially since we struggle so much with finding a way to even voice our concerns. But, the inherent problem here is that minority anger isn't taken as a sign of what it is- frustration at the things we're expected to just shoulder.

* Q: So those are great personal steps, what about when dealing with other people in society? If I see my coworkers treating somebody as an 'other', is there anything useful I can do?

* A: ""hey, cut that out."" Or redirect the conversation. Frown tactics work well too: you just kill the mood by frowning or saying something like ""that joke's not funny"". Sometimes you really just can't control your emotions, and that's something we as PoC have to deal with more than allies, who don't really have a personal connection to the whole thing.

Interracial dating: 

* Every subgroup has its own particular stereotype about relationships. All the ones about PoC, surprise, are otherizing and harmful. For example, there is a constant, constant message that asian-american men are sexless and poor lovers. From penis jokes to portrayals in movies, it all ties back into this idea. This leads to a lot of tension when PoC try to date outside of their own particular ethnicity. 
* There are two ways to go with unsavory racial implications of dating. There's ""Will not date members of x race"" and there's ""Will only date members of x race."" Both of those are just as awful. Being fetishized is not any better than being outright rejected because they both come from the same place - the idea that PoC are this monolithic block of people who all have the same characteristics. So, dating for PoC is a minefield. There is a constantly worry about if partners or potential partners are creepy fetishists, operating on predatory assumptions PoC have to worry about the way people will react to their choice of partners and them just walking around. They have to worry if their *own* standards haven't been warped by racist society. All because of the power imbalances in play.
* It doesn't matter why you're being fetishized, it doesn't make it any better. It’s the same otherization and reductionism of identity hidden in a satin glove. It’s being viewed as a sexual object.

Cultural appropriation:

* Do not get tattoos of kanji/hanzi characters unless you can read them. English speakers love to make fun of ""engrish"" but they often fail to recognize the random characters as tattoos, on little $5 prints at the mall. They're the same damn thing! If you aren't buddhist, don't put buddas in your house. Many people also fail to realize that the yin-yang symbol has real significance and isn't just something for people to draw 'cause it's deep and stuff. In fact, ""duality"" is an incredibly facile reading of it.

* Neopagan white people you do not have spirit animals. Neopagans appropriate a lot of mysticism from various Native American tribes and it is really annoying when they take various rituals for their stuff.

 Important references:

* Very good documentary about white people and hip hop: http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/sxo92/blacking_up_a_documentary_on_hiphop_in_white/

Thanks for reading. Hope you found it interesting!

TL;TL;DR: Just read the damn thing. It’s a 5.5 hour conversation. If you’re too lazy though: Racism is enacted in many subtle ways. Avoid reinforcing beauty standards, don’t other people or appropriate their culture, and recognize that there are many problems within the education system. If you see someone doing these things, call them out on it. Work toward being a better person and making the world a better place for PoC.

I've got a few good suggestions for non-problematic webcomics inside.",BlueBob-Omb,81,27,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1gsqay/after_the_latest_posts_about_gabe_in_srsgaming/,"Yeah, I wasn't reading PA religiously but I don't think I'll ever stray that way again. But here's a choice few of my favorite webcomics, and most of these are pretty good, fun and non-problematic comics. Mind you these are my favorite of favorites so if you guys have a problem with them it might take me a lot of convincing to drop them. But I'm willing to listen.

First, my two favorite gaming webcomics:

[Fanboys](http://www.fanboys-online.com/) | [First Comic](http://www.fanboys-online.com/index.php?id=2) is about the only gamers-on-a-couch comic I could ever think of recommending to anyone. This comic is hilarious for all the right reasons. This one does rely a lot on character humor so starting from the top is recommended. As such I must warn that it's very rough and unpolished in the beginning. Note that sometimes Slipshine ads will show up on the site, if you are uncomfortable with that.

[Brawl In The Family](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/) | [First Comic](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/2008/05/01/alpha-comik/) is an adorable comic about the Nintendo universe. You cannot find a more kid-friendly atmosphere than this. The artist once worried the word crud would bother his audience. This comic relies a lot on knowledge of Nintendo games but does have plenty of character humor that relies on the comic's built-up personalities instead of the 'canon' version of that character. The yearly Christmas comics are an amazing treat!

And my favorite non-gaming comics:

[Wasted Talent](http://www.wastedtalent.ca/) | [First Comic](http://www.wastedtalent.ca/comic/anime-crack) is an autobiographical comic by Angela Melick, or ""Jam"", which follows her as she goes from engineering student to a full-fledged engineer. It's pretty good. That's all I really can say about it.

[El Goonish Shive](http://www.egscomics.com/) | [First Comic](http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2002-01-21) is, as author Dan Shive describes it, ""A strange comic about a group of teenagers and the bizarre, often supernatural, situations that they face. Includes a continuing storyline with non-linear joke comics on the side. WARNING: Often ignores the laws of Physics."" To be more exact it's a comic about magic, science, relationships, genderbending, acceptance, and occasionally big battles! This one is very progressive. Definitely something you want to start reading from the beginning, but takes a loooong while to really get good.

1363701956.0,48,self.SRSDiscussion,1alcf1,I feel that the reaction the news agencies has had about the Steubenville trial has a silver lining...,Spam4119,67,19,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1alcf1/i_feel_that_the_reaction_the_news_agencies_has/,"So there has been a lot of reactions and people pointing out the way the news agencies has characterized the verdict of guilty to the two teenagers with remorse at the loss of ""promising"" football stars and how their previously ""bright future"" is now tainted by being on the sex offenders list and all that.

But that is where I am seeing the silver lining... the fact that all of a sudden there is all this information about *how horrible the news agencies are being*. I am finding it everywhere now. From other news articles pointing out that those commentaries are way off from what needs to actually be said about justice and closure for the victim... to news articles about how badly people are reacting to the agencies expressing remorse at the perpetrators... to articles about how disgusting it is that some people on twitter are even defending the perpetrators, and pointing out how wrong that is. 

Even reddit has seemingly jumped on board in many regards. There was a captain hindsight meme that was upvoted to the very top of the frontpage that basically read, ""If you don't want to be labelled as a sex offender, DON'T rape anybody.""

I am even finding comment threads like this in various posts (yes, somebody makes a rape joke, but look at what the reaction is):

It is good ol' fashioned satire. They are making fun of how the reaction to a girl being raped is to apologize for the rapists is completely nonsensical. Satire is a GOOD thing. It can be a very powerful tool to get at difficult topics, and I have been seeing those sorts of comments in various threads the past few days.

So yes, people are really upset over how the various news agencies has covered the verdict which has caused a backlash... but I think that is the silver lining. That there has been such a huge backlash. Is it bad that there needs to be a backlash? Yes. But I think that such a big backlash exists is a very good thing and really has pushed a lot of information about rape myths into the face of people where they can't brush it off so easily, and has even made it so that attacking rape myths is no longer taboo, at least for the time being.

However, I understand that being referred to as the wrong gender is distressing for many people, including some people who are trans* identified, and I would never, ever suggest that anyone else should react in the same way I do (or react in any way other than what they are comfortable with). I'm wondering if my making light of the situation when it happens to me is an example of my cis privilege that I need to check, or if it's okay for each person to react to being called the wrong gender however they personally see fit.

1359526044.0,48,self.SRSDiscussion,17jqjt,How do we counter Stormfront's BUGS?,pronhaul2012,69,21,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/17jqjt/how_do_we_counter_stormfronts_bugs/,"Basically, Stormfront has been starting a concerted recruitment drive through discussion forms, such as reddit, 4chan, youtube and just about any public news or other discussion.

They call this BUGS. It's centered around posting ""mantras"" or bits of propaganda, which are to be posted simply to arouse discussion and force people to talk about their ridiculous ideas. 

Here's the information you need:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/17dosp/so_you_know_how_everyone_says_reddit_is_being/

Also, going to repost this, which are some of their BUGS guidelines:
● 1 Stay on message; we deal with the genocide of White people and the perpetrators, anti-Whites. When talking to the general public don't go into a rant about Jewish conspiracies, banking families, NWO, etc. White genocide is the first step to establish a beachhead in the general population's consciousness -- we can expand on other ideas later.

● 2 Use the Mantra and our talking points. Everything anti-Whites say always leads to our genocide, and we have good ways to counter their talking points. You can customise our stuff and use it for yourself.

● 3 Use our terminology; ""Anti-White"", ""Pro-White"", ""White genocide"", ""Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White"", ""Africa for the Africans, Asia for the Asians, White countries for everybody"".

● 4 ""Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White"" should be the last thing in your post if possible.

● 5 Don't use their terminology; ""racist"" should ONLY be used in ""anti-racist""; ""nazi"" should ONLY be used in naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews""; ""HATE!"", ""holocaust"", ""facist"" ""LOVE!"" should be avoided; ""diversity"", ""multicultural"" can be pointed out as meaning less White people. Avoid using ""The White race"", ""Caucasians"", ""The Whites"", because it makes it look distant and turns it into a philosophical debate; use 'Our people', 'My people', 'White people', etc.

● 6 Capitalize ""White"", when you're talking about our race.

● 7 ALWAYS use ""Genocide"", NEVER use ""Extinction"", ""Population Displacement"", ""Demographics shift"", etc.

● 8 NEVER call them ""antis"", they are ""anti-White"" - they are against White people existing.

● 9 Use ""As an anti-White"" e.g. ""As an anti-White why do you think more assimilation is required in ONLY White countries?"".

● 10 Don't argue, make our point: ALL White countries &amp; ONLY White countries are told by anti-Whites, who claim to be ""anti-racist"", that they must accept millions of non-Whites and 'assimilate' with them, which is genocide under UN genocide conventions. If people get annoyed of hearing our message that's good, it means they can remember it!

● 11 This isn't about anti-Whites; we are talking to the general public, USE the anti-Whites to humilate them and point out that they support White genocide. A lot of the general public are tired of ""anti-racists"" (anti-Whites) and WE have to show them how to defeat and humiliate them.

● 12 Be aggressive and take the moral high-ground; if they call you names say ""You're only saying that because I'm White"".

● 13 Think before you talk. Talking about commiting violence is a no-go. No talking about genocide tribunals because it makes us look dangerous. Using lots of bad language is going to make you - and us - look stupid. That does not mean treat anti-Whites with dignity.

● 14 YOU ask the questions. If you don't get a reply keep asking them - it means your opponent is embarrassed and is trying to get off the subject. If they demand you answer questions say ""WE ask the questions, because YOU support/justify genocide of MY people!"".

● 15 Use emotional language; ""Why do you hate little White children?"", ""Why do you want to genocide little White babies?"".

● 16 Winning isn't important; you should be winning all of the arguments with the anti-Whites if you do what Bugsters do, but don't worry if you lose a few of them -- this is about imposing our terminology and getting the public talking about White genocide.

● 17 Know your target audience and wrap our message around what appeals to them. Young adults want to talk about education fees and housing prices, Teens want to talk about music, Old people want to talk about pensions, etc. Try to connect with the people using their language/colloquialisms e.g. ""Dude"" ""Mate"" ""Bloke"" ""Howdy"" ""Yeah"" ""Lol"" ""Rofl""

● 18 Flip the script. What if ALL Asian countries were told to bring in immigrants and assimilate with them? What if ""anti-racists"" in Africa demanded that Africans stopped patrolling their borders and kicking out illegal immigrants?

● 19 We're all part of the team. Remember to report any places that you post The Mantra or mini-Mantras in Where did you post the Mantra today? II Bugsters will offer you advice if you're new, ask them for help Swarming and they'll arrive on the link to help you out.

How can we best counter this? Any discussion or debate with them seems to be playing into their hand, but simply ignoring it seems far too passive.

I think we can all agree on that. However, I feel like the reactions in SRS Prime and sometimes Circlebroke of ""Holy shit are you seriously defending a pedophile?"", ""YOU ARE SEXUALIZING A CHILD. PERIOD."" etc. might not be the proper way of looking at things. (I have an open mind and don't intend to concern troll or post in bad faith. Please tell me if I should fix anything.)

I think one of the big reasons my perspective is different is because I'm a teenager (I just turned 16). Reading someone say they think a 15-17 year old is attractive doesn't trigger a gross gut reaction the way it might (or should) in someone older, especially considering I probably find whoever that person is attractive. Also, on Reddit the majority is not much older than me, so I tend to assume the person typing is in high school or college. 

I probably shouldn't give the benefit of the doubt like that when there's a small chance it's an adult who's out of college, maybe way out of college. But I also don't want to demonize someone who's probably a teenager for making a teenager-y remark about someone who it's ethically fine for them (overwhelmingly a him) to be attracted to.

Now, to the other topic I want to ask about here. The whole ephebophilia vs. pedophilia idea and how it relates to the age of consent. I understand that sexualizing of children by adults is disgusting and bad. But isn't there a huge difference between pedophilia and ephebophilia? (Warning, I have no scientific understanding of this. Please tell me if there are any biotruths/other poop.) Normal, healthy people are not attracted to pre-pubescent bodies, I think. So being attracted to them, when you factor in them being children who are vulnerable, can't consent, etc. is a serious, serious issue and you should see a therapist/stay away from kids, etc. But is it wrong to be attracted to someone with a developed body? If they're under the age that society deems them able to consent, it's absolutely wrong to act on that attraction in any way towards them, post images of them or make sexual comments about them (assuming you're not in their age group I think; goes back to my first part). But is it wrong to simply be attracted to them and even fantasize about them?

As for age of consent, I know we need to have one for society to work and to prevent people being taken advantage of. But ethically, when does someone cross the threshold regarding sexuality and what factors does it depend on (maturity, age of the other person, etc.)? Is it as soon as they've reached the age of consent? After? It really depends? I assume it's not before. 

It may sound like I have a bunch of preconceived opinions, but I just wanted to offer my thoughts. Please correct me if I'm thinking about this wrong. I just always see one of two extremes: Overt and gross sexualization and demonization of the former. I'd love to hear some real discussion about it.

William Ryan's ""Blaming the Victim"" part 1",KPrimus,61,13,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/12x6ec/lets_read_along_with_kprimus_william_ryans/,"Welcome to the first part of an indefinite part series where I summarize and quote passages from books that I think everyone here ought to read sometime.

Our first subject is a seminal work of radical sociology, and in fact the origin of the phrase ""victim blaming"" as a term in common parlance. *Blaming the Victim* makes the case that the ""solutions"" enacted to ""fix"" the problems in poor, PoC, or otherwise marginalized communities were in fact methodologies to ""correct"" the behavior of the *marginalized* rather than fixing the environment, societal, and economic factors that create those behaviors.

Chapter 1 is a general overview of the attitudes and methodologies of well-meaning victim blamers. In particular, it cites the examples that are to be presented in following chapters (which I will cover in more detail when we get there): inner-city education, black family life, teenage and unmarried pregnancy, health care, slums, law enforcement, and much more. If these examples sound familiar, it is because they are the same problems that remain to this day unfixed and unaddressed.

For reference, *Blaming the Victim* was originally published in *1971*.

Ryan explains blaming the victim as a way for those guilty of perpetuating the attitudes and issues that marginalize the powerless to assuage their guilty consciences while still giving the appearance of ""making progress.""

&gt;By focusing our attention on the Negro Family as the apparent *cause* of racial inequality our eye is diverted. Racism, discrimination, segregation, and the powerlessness of the ghetto are subtly, but thoroughly, downgraded in importance.

&gt;The problems are there, and there in great quantities... these disturbing signs reflect inequality and a puzzlingly high level of unalleviated distress in America totally inconsistent with our proclaimed ideals and enormous wealth. This thread -- this rope -- of inconsistency stands out so visibly in the fabric of American life, that it is jarring to the eye, and this must be explained to the satisfaction of our conscience as well as our patriotism. Blaming the victim is an ideal, almost painless evasion.

&gt;The second step in apply this explanation is to look sympathetically at those who ""have"" the problem in question... and define them in some way as a special group, a group that is *different.* This is a crucial and essential step in the process... The Different One is seen as less competent, less skilled, less knowing- in short, less human.

He then gives the example of campaigns to ""inform"" inner city parents against the dangers of allowing their children to eat or be exposed to lead paint. He points out that when said children are harmed by such exposure, the framing blames the parent for being not present or inattentive. However, inner city parents are usually working in a desperate effort to stay afloat- a situation that permits little time for child care. And more importantly, *the presence of the lead paint itself is the fault of slum landlords illegally using dangerous paint and failing to maintain their buildings.* The solution to the problem is not to tell the parents to perform impossible acts of childrearing- it is to properly regulate and punish those who are exploiting and abusing the poor. Blaming the victims allows those responsible and those complicit by inaction to force attention away from the central target, societal inequality, discrimination, and racism, and onto the individual affected.

&gt;In each case, of course, we are persuaded to ignore the obvious: The blatant discrimination against the Negro, the gross deprivation of contraceptive and adoptive services to the poor, the heavy stresses endemic in the life of the poor. And almost all our make-believe liberal programs aimed at correcting our urban problems are off target; they are either designed to change the poor man or cool him out.

I end with some pictures- not because I cannot summarize this passage, but because I cannot summarize it in a way that does it sufficient justice.

1325456796.0,49,self.SRSDiscussion,nyzul,On abstaining from raping people,dedaigneux,57,8,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nyzul/on_abstaining_from_raping_people/,"I don't understand why rape is such a contentious topic.

Honestly, it has to be the easiest thing in the world to avoid sexually assaulting or raping someone. All it takes is consent, and it's not like it's hard to determine consent.

If, for whatever reason, one is unsure if the person/people one wants to engage in sexy times with fully consent to the idea, it seems obvious that one should *ask*, perhaps more than once. Hilariously, this idea of *asking* for sex is somehow considered unsexy. You mean some people don't want to be told that you want to have sex with them? Honestly, it's like someone just assumed that the only way to consent to sex is to say ""I consent to sex right now"" in a very dry, asexual, posh voice. Doesn't anyone think it's sexy to be told what someone wishes you to do to them? I think it's hot. Come on, I can't be the only one.

And what's with the bizarre scenarios? I get that the impulse to navel gaze is alluring. I have a degree in Philosophy, believe me when I say that I get it. But it strikes me as manifestly absurd to object to the whole idea of getting consent before (and during) sexy times because of some rare hypothetical that nobody has actually ever heard of happening in real life.

These hypotheticals usually surround one of two issues: drinking and other substances that impair judgment, and age. Why do we only contemplate the aftermath of such hypothetical encounters? Why is it that the ultimate and only question is whether or not the hypothetical is rape? It would simply be easier to establish that in the rare circumstances in which the ability to give consent or the ability to perceive consent are impaired, it would be best to err on the side of caution and decide that sexy times are not worth the risk of raping someone.

Furthermore, it seems suspicious that that risk -- raping someone -- is not something that is weighed in the calculations of rape and consent as often as the seemingly all-important tragedy of falsely accusing someone of rape. Everything I've read on the subject of rape and convictions thereof seems to suggest that actually imprisoning or convicting anyone of rape is extremely rare, given the unfortunate proliferation of sexual assault and rape, and that it follows that imprisoning or convicting someone of rape that they did not commit is therefore, even more rare.

It seems foolish to treat rape accusations as uniquely dubious when we don't level the same sort of criticisms  against other crimes like theft or murder. If people were actually apt to accuse the rich and powerful of a crime in order to profit off of it, it seems that any crime *other than* rape would be easier to falsely substantiate. After all, the incredible amount of criticism and shame that follows any high-profile accusation of a sexual crime seems not to be worth the effort at all. And what's the payoff supposed to be if this false accusation sticks? There's very few people who serve numerous years in prison for sexual crimes unless they were incredibly violent or incredibly prolific rapists. Likewise, settlements in such cases are nowhere near as profitable as those for cases involving things like personal injury or employment discrimination.

The most oft-stated reason one would wish to ""cry rape"" is shame of being caught having sex. Why then would anyone want to draw attention to the idea that they had sex, even if it was ""not consensual""? Not only will everyone in your immediate peer group know that you had sex with a certain someone (even if it has not been established to be consensual), you'll be forced to go over your sexual history in excruciating detail in the following trial and proceedings up to it. I highly doubt that anyone so ashamed of their sexual nature to accuse a consensual partner of rape would be willing to spend the better part of a year, or more, solely concerned with their own sexual behavior as it is scrutinized by the legal system and the court of popular opinion. Of course, that also begs the question, where are these people that are uniquely supportive of rape victims? What perceived gain is there to accusing someone of rape that isn't the fevered delusions of someone utterly unfamiliar with the way our actual and public opinion ""courts"" work?

But back to the calculation of whether or not to have sex in the first place. Who, in their right mind, given the chance of raping someone versus not having sex at a given time, chooses the former as the acceptable risk but not the latter? It's incredibly foolish, short-minded, and irresponsible to risk violating someone in such a grave manner simply because one wishes to have an orgasm. Yet, it's given as a coherent objection to the idea of establishing consent, as if doing the incredibly easy task of not raping people is actually demonizing all forms of human sexuality. I suppose that if your sexuality revolves only around conquer, force, and rape, it might seem rather disappointing to have to have sex with people who actually want to have sex with you too. Of course, justifying that toxic idea of proper sexuality hardly seems rational, let alone moral.

Finally, the idea of perpetual consent. It's taken as somewhat understandable to assume that just because a person has consented to sex with you once, that they have consented to you for sex for the rest of their life. Think for a minute of how incredibly silly that sounds. Is there any other voluntary interaction between two or more people that works like that? Just because you invite someone over to your house one night doesn't mean it's a good idea to climb in their window any night of the week and crash on their couch. Just because I pay you $50 dollars to fix my drain doesn't mean you can just take whatever amount of money you please from me because I consented once to pay you. Yet, it's somehow coherent to claim that having sex with someone in particular way at any given point establishes consent to have sex at any other point in any other fashion.

Who actually thinks that way?!? Likewise, its not only thought as reasonable to assume consent from previous encounters, but it's also presumably understandable to assume consent from something as benign as flirting, being nice, wearing certain clothing, or acting in any sort of fashion whatsoever that may sexually arouse anyone else.

How does any of how we talk about consent and rape not drive everyone absolutely mad? It makes no sense at all in any rational sense of the world.

Not raping people actually seems like one of the easiest tasks I am responsible to perform during the course of my life. That anyone would say otherwise, as if it was hard or at all confusing, is completely and utterly bizarre.

Here's my thinking: If you separate out trolls and hardcore racists (both hopeless in their own way), you're left with the ""average"" reddit racist, and I don't think he's racist so because he's a hateful, evil person, but rather because he believes things that aren't true about American culture.

I picture the average redditor as a white, maybe early to late 20s male, who prefers remaining inside to going out. (I know this is a generalization, but whatever.)  His main sources of information are television programs and popular culture as opposed to actual life experience -- hence the constant repetition of stand up comedy bits.

Within a totally mass-mediated world view, there is very little racism. On television, everyone is friends with everyone, no matter the race. This shallow (or maybe post-modern?) worldview regards history as inconsequential -- a redditor lives in the perpetual Now of movies, TV shows, internet memes, and other weightless ephemera, and all messages point to immediate gratification through consumer consumption as the ultimate answer to all questions. 

Because the average redditor is a decent fellow, he chooses to believe we live in a post-racial world. Wouldn't we all like to live in a world where skin color doesn't matter even a little bit? In this seemingly post-racial world, white people can casually throw around racist terms without thought, because, hey, it's just a joke, and we're all good friends here.

",thinkythought,74,24,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/15t2h7/on_gamer_essentialism_gaming_culture_and_the/,"this started out as a short comment in reply to a great post on srs by thel109

&gt;What is with with these nerds and this ""gamer essentialism"" horseshit?

i started writing a short reply, which turned in to a pretty long reply, which turned in to a fucking goddamn wall of text essay. and i realized i actually had a lot of good thoughts on this that i've been desperately wanting to get down on ""paper"" and discuss.

&gt;They want to be seen as legitimate hobbyists, ala film appreciation/movie buffs or even literature geeks(this one sounds more comparable if you think about people specifically focused on scifi or fantasy)

&gt;The problem is that gaming is sort of its own category, not really that similar to anything that's existed in the past. It's simultaneously experience based and ownership based, whereas most hobbies or fandoms are one or the other. 

&gt;Do you own a sunbeam? If you join the sunbeam drivers club, you're a hobbyist pretty much instantly and surrounded by like minded geeks. Watch a bunch of movies by specific directors or in a specific genre? Well then you're a movie buff/fan of X type of movies who can probably speak about that at length. 

&gt;The problem arises when someone comes in who normally wouldn't be considered part of the group. With either ""fandom"" I just described, there would be a fairly simple litmus test of ""well have you participated in X activity/do you own and love X thing?""

&gt;The problem is that there isn't any easy way to determine between the hardcore fans and less intensive fans without being a fucking bag of cocks. There's obviously a difference between someone who plays games a couple times of week after work for a couple hours, and someone who plays multiple hours every day constantly and owns 500 games... But they're both gamers. 

&gt;Where the jimmies start to rustle is that the super nerds want not just barriers of entry, but some sort of informal ranking that people within the scene respect for how hardcore of a fan you are. 

&gt;This is something that doesn't exist much outside of really neckbearded fandoms. There might be a guy in a bike club who has one decent bike and participates sometimes, and a guy who has 20 and restores them himself and teaches classes. The latter guy may be more well known and respected for his knowledge and expertise, but they would both readily be accepted as enthusiasts and members of the group. 

&gt;The only place you see this pecking order bullshit is anime clubs, star trek conventions, ""gamer culture"" and gaming conventions, magic/other TCG groups etc. 

&gt;This stems(lol stem) from the somewhat flawed belief that nerds should be a protected class and respected as a legitimate minority, especially from a social standpoint. They view themselves not as a hobbyist group, but more like the queer or trans support group at their college, etc. there's a nebulous belief that outsiders only want to heckle them, or are just doing it for attention/to be cool or attempt to gain their respect through association with their group. That's something a wall of text could be written about on its own. 

&gt;But before I lose you here, there's a point to this that i'm getting out. and while i'm treading dangerously close to the territory of the recent ""are there artistic works that have inherently more value?"" thread, the difference is between fandoms that are actually respected as something that people other than guys who live in their parents basements participate in, actual art, and well, nerd stuff.

&gt;these are the same people who argue that games are a legitimate art form, and yet they turn around and present them in a way that makes that a *really* hard pill to swallow. they pretty much want to have their cake and eat it too. have the recognition and respect that would come from that, but at the same time keep it locked up in a basement where they are the sole arbitrators of who a true fan/person appreciating it actually is. 

&gt;i started another paragraph that was a long writeup on the similarities between that and small music scenes around various punk, and home rolled electronic music have evolved.. but that honestly lends them *way* more credibility than they will ever deserve.

&gt;there is no true corrupting force here except for themselves. there isn't anyone trying to ""sell out"" their scene. this is pure highschool lunch room bullshit. the popular kids chastised them until they sat in the back corner table, and now that normal people, or worse, *females*(gasp!) want a seat the table they're exercising their newfound attention and legitimacy to *exclude people entirely for their own entertainment*. 

&gt;i'm not saying this kind of shit doesn't happen in other fandoms, but it's just the way it's being performed here makes them look *really* fucking bad. this kind of behavior has absolutely grenaded ""scenes"" around various things before, and ruined artists reputations when they get involved. and you bet your ass they *do* here. i've heard a lot of this type of ""real gamers"" crap directly from the horses mouth of people who i've sat on panels with at PAX, etc. the poop runs deep. 

&gt;basically, it's going to reach a point where they have to choose between mainstream acceptance and approval, which they're on the precipice of since this shit is really starting to get legs, and the ""legitimacy of their scene"". and every time they kick and scream and spew this shit *everyone who isn't a fucking awful nerd* wonders if it really *is* just some pet rock fleeting thing that only shitty nerds care about. 

&gt;but don't listen to me. i'm just a guy who knows people all around the industry from one guy iOS game devs to major studios, has actually hung out at(and interviewed several times for a position at) valve, has been involved in all aspects of ""gaming culture"" since 5 1/2 floppy drives were common, and has also been involved in several small music scenes, and is friends with all manners of artists and musicians(and is also an artist/musician trailing back to music school in the 90s) from people who play basement shows to people who play sold out festivals. 

&gt;i'm also extremely fucking nerdy, and have a bunch of really nerdy friends. i work in IT, have done some small scale web dev stuff, etc. i've been involved in all kinds of nerdery from TCGs, d&amp;d type stuff, tabletop, all manner of dice/board games, working on classic cars and the people surrounding that, movie fandom(and i don't mean star wars or one specific franchise, general appreciation of movies), star trek/star trek conventions, anime, you get the picture. if it's nerdy, even if it's not computer nerdy, i've probably at least dipped my toe in it. 

&gt;to close, the gun is pointed squarely at the cock here. they control their own destiny. exclusionary tactics *in this way* only exist on things that have been pretty damningly branded as that shit neckbeards do that isn't really art.

(Essay from Slate)",saffanah,57,6,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/,"Read [this](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2012/10/22/is_islam_misogynistic.html) today and not sure how I feel about it:

--------

As an Arab American woman raised in a conservative Muslim family, I would say that yes, Islam is a misogynistic religion.

The messages about gender that I received from my parents, extended family, family friends, religious teachers, and so on ranged from subtle to extreme. I was told, among other things, that:

Women can't speak during prayer to correct an Imam (men can) because their voices are too ""distracting."" (This is based on the hadith, see ""From Hadith – Regarding Concealment Of Voice During Prayer"")
Women should lower their eyes in the presence of men. (To be fair the stuff about lowering one's gaze is also directed toward men, not the other stuff though. This surah is significant in that it is often cited as evidence that hijab is a requirement of Islam, which is a subject of debate within the religion.)
Women shouldn't wear tampons, to preserve their ""purity."" (No quotes from the Quran on this as tampons weren't around in those days, this is another topic of debate and from my understanding, people outside of Islam also debate the issue. So I have only anecdotal comments here in that every Muslim woman I've known has been told something to this effect, and on a personal level, when my mom discovered I was using tampons, she completely freaked out, started screaming, and threatened to take me to the doctor and have them check to see if my hymen was still intact, which seems to be not infrequent behavior—a Muslim friend of mine who was caught skipping class had her parents ask the doctor to check her hymen. But again, this is anecdotal, and I'm just mentioning this as a qualitative ""data point,"" as it were.)
There are passages in the Quran that advocate beating disobedient wives (see this paragraph""In fact, the word in the Quran in 4:34 used for ""beat"" is ""idreb."" It is a conjugate of the word ""daraba"" which primarily means ""to beat, strike, to hit"" - Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, page 538"").
Polygamy is legal and practiced in many Muslim countries and permitted by the Quran
... and so on and so forth. Honestly it would take me hours (and probably lots of therapy) to be able to cogently list all of the misogynistic aspects of this religion and the cultures that have flourished from it. Maybe some of the aforementioned things seem minor, but in my mind they're not negligible, and taken together, so many things have made me feel like my religion hated women.

It's ridiculous to me to hear qualifying statements that Islam is ""paternalistic, but not misogynistic."" Believe me, as a young woman growing up and struggling in Islam, there is little to no distinction between the two.

I'm not saying by any means that these characteristics are unique to Islam. But the question was not ""Is Islam more misogynistic than other religions?"" but rather ""Is Islam misogynistic?""

Some people have mentioned that there is a distinction between culture and religion in Muslim countries. I would argue that that's not really true, at least not in the way that it is in the West. Islam is integrated into Arab cultures in a way that's probably unthinkable to many in Western countries. With the exception of the occasional very small Christian minority, virtually everyone in Arab countries is Muslim, and this basically dominates the culture. Public newscasters casually attribute occurrences to Allah without any controversy, domestic airlines recite surahs from the Quran over the intercom during flights, and so on.

Muslim countries touted as being more liberal, such as Turkey, are such because they are not as strictly and fanatically religious as countries like Saudi Arabia, where the laws and regulations are for the most part drawn from edicts in the Quran and where ""religious police"" (note that they aren't called the cultural police) patrol the streets, harassing women for showing their ankles, preventing women from driving, enforcing the laws that prevent women from working or travelling without permission from a male guardian, and oh, don't forget ""beating young girls"" to prevent them from escaping a fire because they weren't wearing proper religious dress.
I understand, respect, and appreciate people outside of Islam trying to be open-minded about this religion. But to be honest, sometimes it bothers me, and I think people can try too hard to be ""politically correct,"" for lack of a better expression, about this topic and overlook the reality of life in Islam.

I'd like to reassert my argument that Muslim countries heralded as being more liberal are not following Islam as strictly. Any Muslim country that affords, for example, a woman's testimony in court the same worth as a man's testimony, is not actually following the Quran (one male witness equals two female witnesses). The same holds true for countries where polygamy is illegal, and in most cases for any Muslim who affords a female heir the same inheritance as a male heir.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_11wek4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/,

**Note: This is written from a Western, North American, ASL-based context**

**What is deafness and Deafness?**

deafness is the audological condition of being deaf. Viewed as a disability by able bodied/hearing culture.

Deafness is not about ears or about disability. Deafness is about being culturally Deaf - usually being deaf in some way and knowing ASL and participating in the local Deaf community.

**OK, so this disability thing. Tell me more?**

Deaf people view who they are as being a way of life in a positive manner. Certainly we do lack hearing, but that doesn't mean that we are solely any of those words in the manner that they imply for most of us\*:

* disabled
* hearing impaired

\* Here, I am a disabled person so I tend to include deafness as a disability alongside cerebral palsy (my other disability). The view that I footnoted does not make much sense for me due to this, but I'm including it so that you are aware of the Deaf mainstream / majority view.

**Deaf culture as an ethnic group**

Deaf people are an ethnic group as indicated by the capital D. Deaf culture has a few things...

* a visual sign language - ASL\*
* values and norms that are primarily visual

\* There are other sign languages around the world, not just ASL.

Most people that aren't Deaf are called Hearing people. Hearing people have a few things ...

* an aural language - English
* values and norms that are primarily aural

**Values and norms**

All cultures have values and norms. Deafness and Hearingness are not exceptions.

One big norm that I think you have noticed about being Hearing is that it is extremely privileged. Being able to hear is so extremely supported and reinforced in this culture. In other words...

* you don't have to say that you are able to hear
* you can go anywhere and receive and send communication by speaking and hearing
* you don't have to say that you are part of yet another ethnic group. White maybe yes, but Hearing???

Deaf people, on the other hand, do experience a hard time when interacting with the hearing world. Many (not all) hearing people tend to exemplify these characteristics:

* ignorance
* being bigoted (audism)
* impatience with communicating with a Deaf person
* being unwilling to learn even how to say hi or thank you or you're welcome in ASL

I have been very delighted to find out about the SRS-subreddits, I have felt horribly confused at the things that were applauded here on Reddit. It made me very glad to see that opinion is not shared by all.

Now, something came to mind, something I never quite understood. I hope you can help me find my footing, here. I've had the pleasure of meeting a lot of people, some of them even quite nice. But one thing I've never been able to wrap my head around, were men who said *terribly uncomfortable* things about women, in their presence, under the guise of humor, and had their ""jokes"" *laughed at.*

Let me provide you with an example. A guy I knew, let's call him John, was always humorous and a fast talker. He felt confident around people, he was a nice guy, and wasn't shy at all. There was just one thing, though, sometimes in the midst of all the fun and jokes, he would make these super creepy sexual remarks about the women around him - in their presence.

""Man, your tits are sagging, Sue."", ""Oh man, it smells like Julie's cunt again!"", ""What happened to your butt Joanna, did it get bigger?""

Now, I always found these subjects to be inappropriate, uncomfortable and somewhat hostile. Yet they were *always* laughed at, as if some sort of clever joke, even by those targeted. These weren't just one-off comments, they were almost like obsessions, coming up again and again, sometimes even on a daily basis, as if some sort of sick running gag.

I'm not shy, and I'm not prudish, I'm open-minded and I can appreciate a lot of things, but I never understood this. I never, ever found this to be funny. At all. And I've seen more than a few men do exactly this, with exactly that reception. What is going on, SRSD? Is this really acceptable? I never knew how to react, I never laughed, but I also wanted to tell these people to lay off, or ask the people in question how *they* felt about it. It just seemed so universally accepted, that this form of harassment was perfectly funny.

The most recent example I can think of is one of failing to check my privilege as a white-passing person. My friend, a WoC, was talking to me about struggling to have serious conversations about race and racism with her white partner. I wanted very much to help her deal with the lack of communication in her relationship, but couldn't relate to that specific breakdown of communication - I don't face discrimination based on my race, and though racism is a very important issue to me, I don't experience it on a personal level, and so don't have loaded conversations about it with my partner. There were several moments in the conversation where I compared her experience as a PoC in a relationship with a white person to my experience as a woman in relationships with men in general, because the sentiments she expressed seemed so similar to those I'd felt - you can educate a partner who has privilege you lack, but they'll still be missing a fundamental piece of your identity/experience. I realized eventually that I was consistently redirecting the conversation to be about sex rather than race, because the former is something that I feel much more comfortable talking about. I need to learn how to approach conversations about race with PoC instead of avoiding them for fear of knowing too little/being unable to contribute meaningfully. I tried to address the problem by admitting to her how I felt and staying on track with the conversation about white privilege in interpersonal relationships rather than privilege in general.

I have some weird feelings about this, and I'd like to open a discussion here to see if what I'm feeling is valid outside of my own head.

Psychopathy these days is classified as a subset of Antisocial Personality Disorder, according to the DSM.  I have also been diagnosed with a personality disorder, and I find myself on occasion being lumped into the same category.  I think that psychopathy should be treated instead of marginalized, as should anybody who suffers from a more ""acceptable"" mental illness.  Of course, somebody who does something heinous should be made to answer for their crimes, but treatment as well as punishment should be part of that answer.

I guess the biggest problem I have is this:  When you are calling somebody a psychopath in the circlejerk, you are using a diagnosis of a mental illness as a pejorative.  And that just makes me feel pretty terrible inside -- it's not that big of a leap, in my head, from calling somebody ""psycho"" to calling somebody ""borderline"" when you're trying to emphasize some negative quality.

There are even some extremes like Spain, where the age of consent is 13, but that might really be a bit too much; they're probably operating under the (questionable) assumption that 13 year olds *can* be mature enough to give informed consent to sex and *should* be mature enough to report actual rape.

There's also some pretty clear evidence of the need for intersectionality - black, amerindian and multiracial women report much higher rates of rape than white women. 

but,  you may ask, what about teh menz?  the survey uses the (problematic) definition of rape involving forced penetration, and finds that 1.5% of men have been raped over their lifetimes.  It also includes information on men ""made to penetrate"" - being forced to sexually penetrate another man or woman, either as a result of physical restraint,  threat of violence, or being unable to consent due to being drunk, high or passed out.  4.8% of men reported having been made to penetrate over their lifetimes, 1.1% over the last year.

The fact that these are two different categories is disturbing to me, partly because of the extent to which it perpetuates rape culture.  to define rape as penetration, instead of unwanted sexual activity (and thus make women nearly incapable of rape) marginalizes victims whose experiences fall outside of that definition.  It also perpetuates the myth that bodily response is equivalent to consent, since presumably those ""made to penetrate"" had erections.  It also has everything to do with patriarchal biotruthy definitions of masculinity.  Because obviously REAL men want sex all the time and thus will always consent to penetrating someone else!

Now, the MRA interpretation of this is of course ""by focusing on male on female rape, feminists are marginalizing male rape victims!""  but that's predictably misplaced blame.  The patriarchy and rape culture marginalize these victims.  And they deserve advocacy and understanding, as do all victims of sexual violence.  I wouldn't put the onus on feminists to do this - feminism definitionally focus on ways that  the kyriarchy victimizes women.  demanding that feminists advocate for male rape victims is just reinforcing the patriarchy. 

that said, I wish there was a movement to advocate for male victims of rape (and for that matter, domestic violence).  the MRM seems to primarily use these examples as fodder for their bullshit anti-feminism, as if feminists had invented the patriarchal norms that exclude men who are put into a position of weakness (aka, male directed misogyny).",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_xylr4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/xylr4/tw_rape_culture_and_made_to_penetrate/,

&gt; a specifically postmodern intellectual discourse that consists of reactions to, and analysis of, the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Postcolonialism is defined in anthropology as the relations between European nations and areas they colonized and once ruled.

While many take this term literally - assuming it simply refers to ""the period of time after colonialism"" - it actually has plural meaning. It can also be used to refer to the continuation of colonialism with new and different power structures and control of production/knowledge. Becase postcolonialism refers to a continuation of colonialism, the word is not hyphenated in order to symbolize the ways in which we have not moved on colonialism. 

&gt; the term postcolonialism – according to a too-rigid etymology – is frequently misunderstood as a temporal concept, meaning the time after colonialism has ceased, or the time following the politically determined Independence Day on which a country breaks away from its governance by another state. Not a naïve teleological sequence which supersedes colonialism, postcolonialism is, rather, an engagement with and contestation of colonialism's discourses, power structures, and social hierarchies ... A theory of postcolonialism must, then, respond to more than the merely chronological construction of post-independence, and to more than just the discursive experience of imperialism. - [Source](http://books.google.com/books?id=xa8waWTrgFwC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

Because of the way that formerly colonialized places have been homogenized by the Western world, they are often conceptualized under umbrella terms like [The Third World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_world). Notice that [the green areas in this map of the Third World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:First_second_third_worlds_map.svg) and [this map of colonies as of the end of the Second World War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colonialism_in_1945_updated_legend.png) cover much of the same ground. Colonialism created a binary opposition structure, setting the Western World as superior and colonized nations as inferior. This opposition justified ""[white man's burden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_man%27s_burden)"", the colonizer's self-perceived ""destiny to rule"" subordinate peoples. Postcolonialism, on the other hand, attempts to tear down these power structures and works in [hybridization and transculturalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization).  

[The ultimate goal of postcolonialism is to acknowledge, account for, and combat](http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-01-09-mbembe-en.html) [the residual impact of past colonialism on cultures.](http://www.ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-and-the-world/postcolonial-studies/harald-fischer-tine-postcolonial-studies). One of the most important goals of postcolonialism is to clear space for multiple voices and perspectives, especially the voices of those who have long been silenced by more dominant ideologies. Within postcolonialism, those who have been previously silenced by the forces of the hegemonic culture are referred to as [*subalterns*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaltern_%28postcolonialism%29): 

&gt;  subaltern is not just a classy word for oppressed, for Other, for somebody who's not getting a piece of the pie....In postcolonial terms, everything that has limited or no access to the cultural imperialism is subaltern-—a space of difference. Now who would say that's just the oppressed? The working class is oppressed. It's not subaltern....Many people want to claim subalternity. They are the least interesting and the most dangerous. I mean, just by being a discriminated-against minority on the university campus, they don't need the word 'subaltern'...They should see what the mechanics of the discrimination are. They're within the hegemonic discourse wanting a piece of the pie and not being allowed, so let them speak, use the hegemonic discourse. They should not call themselves subaltern. - [Source](http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458)

Postcolonial theorists feel that in order for postcolonial ideals to properly flourish, space for subaltern voices must first be cleared in academia. Postcolonial theorists feel that academia is almost suffocatingly [Eurocentric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_thought) because the Europens who dominated academia in its formative years [disregarded the voices of those they studied, instead preferring to rely on their own intellectual superiority.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_%28book%29) This attitude of Eurocentric ideals in academia was catalyzed primarily by Western [Imperialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism). 

Postcolonialist thinkers feel that [subaltern voices *can* be incorporated into academia, but Eurocentric academics would simply *prefer* not to allow that.](http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/docentianglo/materiali_oboe_lm/2581_001.pdf). In other words, ""To refuse to represent a cultural Other is salving your conscience, and allowing you not to do any homework."" In order to prevent essentializing subaltern voices - when in truth they are heterogeneous - some postcolonial theorists suggest, ""strategic essentialism"". [Strategic essentialism means speaking on behalf of a group while using a clear image of identity to fight oppression](http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~mma/teaching/MS80/readings/hooks.pdf).

Postcolonialism also studies cultural identity in colonized societies. For example, how do you form [a national identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) after colonial rule? How should that new national identity be celebrated - should it maintain strong ties with the colonizers, or embrace a new identity? How has the knowledge of the colonized people been generated and utilized by the colonizer? Has the colonizer attempted to use literature to portray the colonized people as inferior? Postcolonialism focuses on the struggles of intermingling cultural/national identity and history. 

&gt; Ultimately, however, Postcolonialism is a hopeful discourse. The very ""post"" defines the discipline as one that looks forward to a world that has truly moved beyond all that colonialism entails, together. Mbembe finds it gives him ""hope in the advent of a universal brotherly [and I would add sisterly] community"". Asking what it means to be human together, post-colonialism aims at decolonizing the future. - [Source](http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-01-09-mbembe-en.html)

I hope you don't mind that I'm sharing it here, and I hope I don't say anything too problematic:


As a relative newcomer to the social justice world, I have been doing a lot of thinking about my language, my perceptions, and the beliefs I hold because I’ve “always thought that...” A side-effect of that is that I am much more aware of the things other people say as well.

I try really hard to point out problematic and offensive language when it’s said in my presence, and, of course, to point it out when I say it myself, though I am not always successful. I am rarely the target of this language: I am a white, heterosexual, cisgender, highly educated woman in Canada, and aside from the misogyny and sexism that any woman faces, I do not often directly experience hatred. I find it easy enough to call this language out: I am not responding to people who speak hatefully about an aspect of myself, so I have no difficulty telling someone (or myself) that the language they have used is hurtful and/or offensive and/or problematic.

I had an experience recently, however, that highlighted for me how much easier I have it because in most cases I am an ally. It’s a jarring reminder of my privilege to experience a small echo of what it is like to be part of an oppressed group, and it has made me both sad, for having experienced it, and grateful, for knowing that it is a very small aspect of my life.

I was drinking with some new friends and, over the course of the evening, heard a number of comments about how awful fat people are: “that fucking fat bitch” or “ugly fat roommate” or “God, she was so fat” and “I hate fat bitches”.
I had no idea how to respond, and felt myself frozen and embarrassed because, well, I’m fat. 

Maybe I (to appropriate a word, and I hope it's not offensive to do so) “pass”, because I am lucky enough to be the kind of fat that people can call “curvy”. But my doctors tell me that I’m overweight, and my family tells me that I should exercise more, and my friends hint that maybe I shouldn’t order that dessert, and my mirror shows me my body every day. So I know I’m fat, and I assume other people do as well, which is why I was so...surprised to hear people discuss their hatred for fat people in front of me.

I was embarrassed, because even though they weren’t talking specifically about me, all I could think was “They must be thinking about how fat I am. They must be looking at how fat I am.”

I was hurt, because of course I feel bad about being fat, and their words were a reminder that a lot of people think less of me because I am not a skinny body.

Mostly, though, I was frozen, because I didn’t know how to call out hateful speech about fat people without bringing myself into it, and “admitting” that I’m fat, as though they could not see it themselves. 

So I said nothing.



I take this as a reminder that it’s really important not to assume that your words will not affect someone in your presence. Maybe they didn’t think I was fat enough to count as a “fat bitch” and assumed it would not hurt me, or maybe they didn’t care: but the speaker does not get to choose who “counts”.

I will remember this the next time I act as an ally, and be grateful that those moments are not fraught with my own perceptions of myself and how other people view me, or made more heavy by a mixture of embarrassment, discomfort, sadness, and shock.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_qhc7i,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/qhc7i/how_do_you_respond_to_hateful_speech_directed/,

1328230857.0,47,self.SRSDiscussion,p8k1z,[EFFORT] Intersectionality 101 ,,57,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/p8k1z/effort_intersectionality_101/,"**Intersectionality** is

&gt; [a methodology of studying ""the relationships among multiple dimensions and modalities of social relationships and subject formations"".](http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1086/426800) The theory suggests—and seeks to examine how—various biological, social and cultural categories such as gender, race, class, ability, and other axes of identity **interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels, contributing to systematic social inequality**. Intersectionality holds that **the classical conceptualizations of oppression within society, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and religion-based bigotry, *do not act independently of one another*; instead, these forms of oppression interrelate, creating a system of oppression that reflects the ""intersection"" of multiple forms of discrimination** - [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)

Thus, intersectionality allows us to consider the ways that parts of identity (race, gender, class, ethnicity) are bound together and relate to one another within cultural patterns of oppression. 

While the reflection of interaction between different identity categories began in feminist theory in the 1970s and 1980s, the term *intersectionality theory* was not coined until 1989, when [Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw) ([Works](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=kimberle+williams+crenshaw&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C43&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0)) used the following metaphor to describe how gender oppression and race oppression intersect in the lives of black women: 

&gt; Consider an analogy to traffic in an intersection, coming and going in all four
directions. Discrimination, like traffic through an intersection,
may flow in one direction, and it may flow in another. If an accident
happens in an intersection, it can be caused by cars traveling from
any number of directions and, sometimes, from all of them. Similarly,
if a Black woman is harmed because she is in an intersection, her injury
could result from sex discrimination or race discrimination […] But
it is not always easy to reconstruct an accident: Sometimes the skid
marks and the injuries simply indicate that they occurred simultaneously,
frustrating efforts to determine which driver caused the harm. - [Source](http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/uchclf1989&amp;div=10&amp;id=&amp;page=)

In other words, while there is an assumed differentiation between racial discrimination and gender discrimination, [black women are often discriminated against on both bases - race *and* gender - at the same time](http://www.kickaction.ca/node/1499). Discrimination against black women cannot be conceptualized as about race only or gender only, these discriminations are interconnected. 

Rather than focusing on the majority culture, the theory of intersection **reflects the minority culture**. [It allows us to understand how some people groups have been positioned as troublesome or ""the other"" in Western cultures](http://www.caen.iufm.fr/colloque_iartem/pdf/knudsen.pdf). The word ""troublesome"" is here used to reflect a person or people who make it difficult to construct a normalization and conceptualization of a group. These ""troublesome"" people whose experiences fall outside of the generalization of the group are then marginalized. [There are three approaches - usually referred to in academic circles as ""the three complexities"" - to studying and conceptualizing intersectionality](http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1086/426800). 

**[Interlocking Matrix of Oppression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_of_domination)**

The interlocking martrix of opression (which was created in [this essay](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/252.html) by  [Particia Hill Collins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Hill_Collins) - ([Works](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=patricia+hill+collins&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=1%2C43&amp;as_sdtp=on))) explains issues of oppression that deal with the way different social classfications (gender, race, class, sexual orientation, age, etc) are interconnected. 

This theory is most simplistically illustrated using the example of [Colin Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell):

&gt; Many argue that [Powell's] success (as one Black man out of millions) is proof that discrimination based on race has been, or is close to being, eradicated in the United States, but proponents of the theory of the matrix of domination would argue that this overlooks issues of social class, gender, and age, Powell being an upper class, middle-aged/elderly male. - [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_of_Domination)

The various intersections of social inequality are also sometimes referred to as *the vectors of oppression and privilege*. 

**[Standpoint Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_theory)**

Standpoint Theory can basically be watered down into the idea that an individuals' perspectives are influenced by their own unique lived experiences in social locations and groups. For example,

&gt; if there are two Hispanic women in a group, their standpoints may be similar in terms of race and sex categories; however, if their economic status is different, their standpoints are not completely the same. - [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_theory)

Societal knowledge is, thus, located within each individual's specific geographic location, making knowledge vary dependent upon the social conditions which produced said knowledge. Thus, *situated knowledge* is knowledge that we gain from our lived experiences. Out of this theory, the feminist variant [standpoint feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_feminism) was created.

1359431594.0,43,self.SRSDiscussion,17h4w7,Husband and I are planning a child. He has a very unconventional idea about raising them. Wondering if this is a good idea. ,Taylor_VenTell,63,20,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/17h4w7/husband_and_i_are_planning_a_child_he_has_a_very/,"Hello! I'm in a very bizarre situation, and I would like some input from some like minded situations. I apologize about how absurd this sounds, and I swear that I'm not trolling. 

So, a little background about us. We are both in our mid 30s, and immigrated to Canada about 8 years ago. Both of us grew up in relatively impoverished conditions (based on western standards), and pushed through university. We got married, and we moved to Canada when I received a job offer here. 

A few months later, he found employment and over the years, we've become upper middle class. We have a decent income with a nice home and I am grateful that we have been this fortunate. We're both pretty frugal folk as well, so other than the basic living commodities and 2 laptops, our house is basically devoid of personality or decoration. We basically put our money into the house, bills, food, and savings. 

At this point, we feel that our careers are more or less secured and we've begun to plan having a child. This is where the question comes in. 

My husband is pretty adamant about raising our child in a sort of pseudo-low class environment. Basically, this means that we will move into a small apartment, and rent out our house. He doesn't want to compromise the child's development or potential so we will still send them to a good school and buy healthy food for them. However, (after infancy), we will buy them very few toys (birthdays and Christmas) and basically just pretend to be poor until the kid is in their teens, probably when they start high school. We'll encourage the kid to have a small job like delivering flyers to earn some pocket change (which my husband will accompany them on for safety reasons).

So now you're probably wondering, what's his reasoning?
Well, in a nutshell, he wants to raise a kid who values hard work and has a humble attitude towards life. 

In his words (I'm paraphrasing a bit here), he wants to raise the kid to not rely on or value material luxuries, and to appreciate the little things. In addition, he feels that his approach will teach the kid to work hard for things that they do want and teach good values. 

I can kind of understand where he's coming from, since the country we originate from has a HUGE wage gap, and the new generation of rich kids seem incredibly spoiled and elitist. Moving isn't really a big problem since we don't have that much property to haul around, and I personally don't mind living in a small apartment since it's still much bigger than the place I grew up in. 

However, I'm just worried if we'll be putting the child at risk by doing this. Is this a good idea? I can understand where he's coming from but it still seems kind of unnecessarily complicated and potentially harmful. Asking our friends has yielded some polarizing viewpoints, and I figured I'd ask here since you guys are pretty knowledgeable about social issues. 

Opinions would be appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR: Husband and I are planning a kid. Husband wants to raise them in a pseudo-low class environment to teach good values. I'm not sure how to feel. 


**UPDATE** After seeing the overwhelmingly negative reactions to this idea, as well as some good counter arguments, I've talked to him about it, and we've come around and decided that we'll skip the whole apartment thing. We still feel like it's important to teach good work ethic and appreciation of money so we'll still try to get them to do chores for pocket change and maybe get a paper route.

I've been a periodic lurker and I find the anti-feminism, racism etc. on reddit pretty disturbing (although I've been hesitant to jump on the r/atheism hate train, due to some of the people I've encountered in the comment section of the subreddit who have helped me through some troubling aspects of my life). But anyways, I find SRS culture fascinating and I want to understand it further so here are a few questions.

First off, I'm a guy. Is that even allowed? I keep hearing about the ""fempire"" and I recently discovered [Maxiamaru](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/yo51f/has_20000_readers_assumes_majority/) and his [discussion](http://i.imgur.com/MccN9.png) with a mod. Now I know Maxiamaru is a dick and what he said is incredibly backwards, that's not even worthy of discussion any more. But in the discussion with the SRS mod, toward the end, there's a bit of man hate from the mod that I don't really understand:

""typical male, doesn't know when to shut up.""

""I'm a male and I have a peepee. Here are its opinions, ftfy""

I found this in other places on the subreddit as well, I just can't think of where(I'm sorry! I usually source). Now this is not a rant with me wailing about how men are being so oppressed by women and blah blah. I'm really just curious, are men welcome? If SRS is mainly an outlet for female feminists, then I'm more then inclined to respect that and unsubscribe.

That was pretty much my main area of curiosity. Nothing but respect for you guys, sincerely. Also, if you want to inform me further on the ways of SRS please do!

I thought it was a good video, and brought up a lot of interesting points on secularism, but this post isn't about that.  It's about comments from ""Josh, Official SpokesGay"" about the hostess, Cara Santa Maria:

There's a lot more, but I'll stop there for now.

My conclusions thus far is that yes, he is a shitposter, and it seems like gender-policing.  I think I understand why he may think these things, but I feel that it's not her responsibility to be the one that tries to be everything of some feminist ideal, and it seems like it detracts from her contribution as the hostess.

Am I wrong in thinking this?

I'm sure there are other problems with his posts, but this was my initial reaction, and I just needed to get my thoughts posted.

It was simple data collection/traffic monitoring, 15.5 hours (6:30am-10pm).

I turned up with my boyfriend and we thought we'd be working together. My boss split us. He said ""you won't be in sight of each other, hope that isn't a problem"". I wasn't in sight of anyone at all, just alone in the middle of the street with a fluoro jacket on and a clipboard.

My boss relieved me of my post (we weren't allowed to leave our data collection spots unless someone else took over, for any reason at all, which meant no unauthorised toilet trips (to the local library of all places, as we were working outside and they didn't provide facilities for us)) at 10am and I went to the toilet. At 1:30pm, I realised I'd started my period and needed to get out of there ASAP, but I couldn't leave, so I waited. And waited. And waited. At 2:40pm I ran round to my boyfriend's data spot in tears and he took me onto a building site that had toilets (they were amazingly friendly, nothing to do with my boss's company, and the women's toilets had a special PIN code unknown to the men). My boyfriend said we were going for lunch and no one was going to stop us, so he told our boss we'd be back in an hour (we'd been working for nearly 7 hours at that point)


When we got back, my boss hung around my spot and talked to me a lot about his wife. We had similar names and he started calling me by the pet name he uses for his wife (not the name I go by). He said he didn't like to leave people on their own, so I suggested that my boyfriend could work with me, as it was getting a bit more dangerous as the sun set. He said that he couldn't spare anyone to relieve my boyfriend. He also mentioned an anecdote about taking one of his 17-year-old first aid students into a sex shop when he used to teach first aid.


At 9:30pm, he pulled up alongside me on the curb in the company van, alone, and said ""why don't you get in the van for the last half hour so you'll be safe?""



I said ""uhh, no, I feel like standing really, I've been sitting all day"" and flipped through my paperwork so I didn't have to look at him, but I could see out of my peripheral vision that he stared at me for ~5mins before saying ""OK, see you in a bit"".


I felt sick and rang my parents, just to speak to someone, as I was alone in a dark, unfamiliar street, with only single strangers occasionally filtering by and I was prohibited to visit my boyfriend in the next street or I would not be paid (not allowed to leave my data collection spot). They were shocked and worried about me.


I braved the last half hour alone and said goodbye to my boss. He touched my shoulder and said ""I'm glad you're OK &lt;wife's petname&gt;"".



I know his actions felt creepy. Logically, I know this. But why do I feel guilty? Why am I fervently against letting my Dad pass on a complaint about this man's behaviour? Why is half of my brain saying ""he's just an old guy, harmless, maybe he WAS trying to look out for you""?

So I read something recently that got me thinking about this ""phenomenon"", so to speak, of things not being as valid coming from a woman or PoC as when they come from a man or a white person.  As I am a white woman, I can only speak directly to what I've experienced, though I can say I've observed white people doing this to PoC too.  


It's that moment when you know what you're talking about, and you say it aloud, and immediately you're dogpiled with doubt: ""are you SURE?""  ""you weren't just overreacting?""  ""that actually happened?!"", etc.  It's not overt, but it's misogyny(/racism) nonetheless.  Then, suddenly, a man agrees with you, and it's as if a light came from the heavens and the song of angels surrounded your point, and people start coming around, begrudgingly agreeing with /what you said in the first place/.  


For example, my fiance, who loves me and supports me and is actively fighting his privilege daily since deciding to be with me, does this shit /all the damn time/, even in fields (such as car repair) where he knows my knowledge to be faaaaaaaar superior to his (""I have a greyish blue Jetta.  I think it's a 2004.  Trancie tells me it has a four-cylinder engine but I'm not sure what that means."" --him)  Other men do it too--my father dismisses my observations out of hand unless my brother backs them up.  Women scientists make discoveries and are ignored, even if they publish on the topic, but as soon as a male scientist ""makes"" the same discovery, it's on the damn news the next day.  


There are bazillions of examples of this...can you share some, SRSD?

**EDIT** I just realized how to phrase what I mean here, too!  Uhm.  So basically in response to a couple of comments I've gotten, I wanted to clarify that I don't mean that people who have privilege should automagically be denied the right to speak their piece.  I mean that people who have privilege are very often so steeped in it that their piece they want to speak *openly oppresses others*, even if they don't think it does.  

When that neutronicus person started commenting, I didn't know how to express quite what I meant WRT his comment about advancing an agenda, but now I do.  EVERYONE has an agenda they want to advance, but in the VAST FUCKING MAJORITY of cases, the marginalized person(s) speaking want to further their cause TO BE SEEN AS HUMAN BEINGS, RESPECTED, AND VALIDATED IN THEIR EXPERIENCES.  Privileged persons are speaking to further their cause of OPPRESSING THOSE PEOPLE, and don't necessarily take into account that THEIR WORDS DO SO REGARDLESS OF INTENT.  As such, while a privileged person's opinions and thoughts are still valid, they are often not WELCOMED into the discussion because they so frequently UPHOLD the oppression the marginalized are attempting to defy BY speaking out.

---------------------------------------------------

As a front-page lurker with little patience for bigotry, SRS has become something of a safe haven for me. I come to this website to waste time on dumb internet humor, not to wallow in hate speech. SRS is a breath of fresh air, a community of folks who turn Reddit culture on itself as a means of exposing the website's more toxic elements.


I understand that part of the insider humor involves poking fun at the ""stereotypical redditor,"" the straight white cismale with a comp-sci degree and a cheeto-stained fedora. And this is fine. When used as a counter to Reddit's very really racist, very really sexist, very really transphobic use of stereotypes, it subverts the sorts of lazy and offensive humor that many redditors deem ""edgy.""


What I take issue with is when this type of humor turns into a value judgment, a set of criteria by which a ""shitty person"" is determined. When the stereotypes precede and even inform the activism, these circle jerks are no longer subversive humor. They are damaging to a community of potential allies. Here is an example from a [recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1h1l6f/in_a_thread_about_intellectual_jokes_you_should/) about ""intellectual jokes"":
&gt;What put me off the most was that reddit's idea of ""intellectual"" is basically ""smeart and so geek!"" Like, if you ask most educated people what ""intellectual"" means they'll tell you something about the abstract, the philosophical and give examples of political theorists, philosophers, writers, etc. You know, the old ""it's so nice to meet another solipsist!"" type joke.

&gt;The entire thread is LE PUN LE ENGINEER LE MATH. Knowing number systems is not anywhere close to the classical meaning of ""intellectual."" What the fuck reddit.

This is not a complaint about something ""bigoted, creepy, misogynistic, transphobic, racist, homophobic, or just reeking of unexamined, toxic privilege."" This is demarcating the lines of what one person considers to be ""intellectual"" as a means of insulting an entire thread of Redditors who had nothing to do with one particular misogynistic comment.

[As a side note, I've always heard [the joke in question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1h1cyg/whats_the_most_intellectual_joke_you_know/capuuw5) told as a non-gendered dig at grammar snobs (""Where's the library at, asshole?""), and I've always found it pretty hilarious. Which I suppose makes AdequateSteve's sexist take on it all the more offensive.]


Basically, I'm wondering if the STEM stereotype is becoming a cheap excuse to wage a war of intellectual disciplines. This isn't the first time I've seen an unnecessary dig at someone's scientific predilections, and it probably won't be the last. But as someone whose BA consists of equal parts natural science and humanities, it's discouraging to see an otherwise brilliant attack on internet privilege devolve into something hateful, elitist, and very far from its original purpose.


[Second side note: in the [""intellectual jokes"" circlejerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1h1l6f/in_a_thread_about_intellectual_jokes_you_should/caq11b3), several SRSters posted some jokes of their own. Two music puns and a political joke have been upvoted, while a joke about vector calculus has been downvoted. Really not sure why.]


Some disclaimers: I'm not trying to suggest that this problem is ANYWHERE NEAR on the same level as the bigotry that SRS attacks. I'm also not suggesting that the problem is OVERWHELMING. I only ever see this happening withing the comments sections, and only every so often when the STEM stereotype comes up. And I'm only raising this issue because I find it discouraging when the one decent subreddit conflates my privilege with my geeky interests. I'm trying my best to be a good ally, and I don't think I should be made to feel bad about my science degree.


**TL;DR** A social justice ally with a natural science bent is concerned that the SRS circlejerk occasionally bullies science geeks in a diversion from their routine misandry.

I also feel that he may be like ""this isn't your place to be offended,"" because I am a young cis woman. However, this professor doesn't know that my partner is trans, and I am really struggling to not blow up at him every time that word leaves his mouth.

I hope we're cool, then.

Okay, so, like many young Americans I find myself in a tough financial situation at a pretty young age. This is a bit accentuated by the fact that I am an immigrant (Russian), and the only people of my family who are in this country are my parents and I. Point being, we're not very rooted, and for a pretty long time we were poor but now we are less so. There are many, many people in the US that are in a similar situation; immigrants from Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, what have you. I'm friends with a lot of other immigrants, actually, and that's mostly by coincidence (which just goes to show how many there are). They come from very diverse cultures, but there is something that seems to be common among them.

***You would be hard pressed to find an immigrant whose family is in a tough financial situation (as tends to be the case), or really any person in a tough financial situation, who is going to college to study an art or social science.***

Why? I'm going to try to explain it the way I see it.

When you go to college, you are purchasing a service. Having the money to purchase that service is already a privilege. However, you are also making an investment. People in tough financial situations need to make a ""smart"" investment (that is, one that is likely to have a high financial output compared to the financial input). When I was looking up statistics on the internet and asking around, I was generally informed that degrees in technology, science, and business are more likely to get you a stable and high income. My parents bought a house recently, and I need to start paying that off as soon as I get out of college or they will be working for the rest of their lives. Not too different from a lot of other stories I've heard around.

Statistics tell us that business, tech, and science degrees are financially the best investment. If you are poor, or if you have financial obligations, you cannot afford to make an bad investment in college. If all degrees have equal economic utility, I would probably be pursuing illustration, but I can't. I can't ""fuck around,"" so to speak. This has been a silent understanding between myself and every other person in a similar situation that I have ever met. **There is no cushion for us, should we take the risk of pursuing a degree considered ""low utility"" and ultimately fail to make money with it.**

The point is that it strikes me as an injustice that someone who is in a position to study arts or social sciences in college would go around calling STEM majors misogynistic neckbeards when the very fact that they can afford to study arts or social sciences shows that they are privileged on several axes that those ""STEM beckbeards"" may not be.

So, I don't understand, why make fun of STEM majors?

[This is the comment thread I got involved with](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/11kanw/ill_take_your_word_for_it/c6n9u1z?context=3)

I hadn't realised my opinions were so strong until I started commenting them... 

It seems to me that men view my thoughts as vain and meaningless, whilst the more I think about it, the angrier I am getting.

I hate that when a friend asks to borrow my clothes, I have to painstakingly explain that i'm actually not the same size as them, but several bigger, then show them the dress size tag to prove it.

I hate it even more when I have to go so far as letting them try my clothes on, because I'm wearing a fake size, to prove it won't fit them.

The looks of disdain from them as they realise I qualify for the same size as people they consider to be 'fat' but don't look the part.

Only a few days ago I got into a fight with my boyfriend over this.  
He's buying me a halloween costume this year because I'm going to my first ever Halloween party. I sat with him as we searched through the net for the perfect costume, then looked at him in horror when he went to order one in size 10/12.

I told him it would never fit me, he needes to buy size 14/16. He then told me not to be stupid because i'm not that fat.

This leads to a row resulting in him taking my measurments and discovering I am indeed a size 16.

What are your thoughts on this?

**TL:DR** I feel like society has infiltrated into our culture to associate a number with a psychical stereotype, and this makes my blood boil.

what i think the two terms here mean is that masculinity treats feeling as a joke, and something instumental that people can change, expedcially if the flaws in thier feelings are pointed out.  also the idea is implicit that any harm to feelings isnt a legitimate thing to complain about.

this is why men will mock eachother more openly, and to expect their friends not mind.  and in many ways, this is a lot of fun, but its also bad.  im very sensitive to this, and im fearful of it occasionally.  especially since im a man and people wont take my objection to it seriously very often, or if they do it often seems like a big deal when i do bring it up.

the other side is feminity, in which emotions are taken seriously, and considered as ends in themselves.  this is why women will be more polite to each other, to the point were there is a sterptype that women are nice to each others face but 'bitchy' behind peoples back.

i appreciate this kind of thing, and its how i act too, because i recognize that social interactions are occasionally, with no fault to anyone, uncomfortable and painful.  i like it when people recognize that i can often feel this pain and take it seriously.

also i think this relates to gaslighting, if you know the concept.  this is long so i dont want to elaborate anymore though.

There is no doubt that a number of the followup posts were pure shitlord SRS worthy poo- from the sizeist slur to the rape fantasies to the homophobic shaming.  They're covered pretty well in the thread, and represent reddit at its worst.

The original post, though, was what got called out first, and the submitter asserted that ""not raping"" someone should be insufficient to earn ""good"" status.   [edit: title was Yet another GGG whose sole ""good"" quality is not raping someone [+935/-278] and link to comments is http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/szar9/yet_another_ggg_whose_sole_good_quality_is_not/

I differ on that point.  The original GGG post presented a scenario where a young man does not take advantage of an intoxicated, potentially underage young woman.   

On a reddit GGG meme, I don't have any problem with this being described as ""good."" The protagonist made the ""good"" choice at this particular fork in the road.  To the extent some random 15 year old kid is turning to reddit for social cues (shudder) the GGG meme is a small step in the right direction.  

Reddit oozes rape culture, and the protagonist here chose respectable human behavior over rape culture.  And GGG status is not a Nobel Laureate-as I understand it, it's used for everything from sharing a joint to turning the music down to not hogging the sidwalk all kinds of basic acts of minimal decency or generosity.  

The thread, itself, kind of proves my point.  The original post looks a lot better than a lot of the festering crap that followed- the homoephobic or sizeist slurs, the rape fantasies, etc., etc.  

SRS should point out the worst in redditors.  Whoever made the meme was, at that moment, in some small way, rejecting rape culture.  Even if you think that's a baby step, it's way ahead of the curve.

This is gonna be a *very* 101 post, as the full depth and breath of this subject take up an entire shelf of my book collection.

Anti-Porn feminism holds the view that pornography is [""the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words""](http://books.google.com/books?id=rxE8FQzjpYMC&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). In interest of being less heterosexist, perhaps it would be best to adjust this to ""persons placed in the passive role (the role of ""women."""")
Many anti-porn feminists believe that all pornography is rape- or at very least ""rapey,"" a contributory factor to rape culture and the cultural degradation and humiliation of women. Major examples include.. well, watch a mainstream porn video sometime. If you *really* want clarification that badly...
**HELLA HYPER HOLY SHIT TRIGGER WARNING FOR SEXUAL ABUSE, VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, AND RAPE JESUS FUCK I WARNED YOU DO NOT CLICK ON THIS**
[click here](http://www.adultdvdtalk.com/reviews/read_review.dlt/sku=23993/teen-line.htm)

That was released as a mainstream, intended for all audiences pornography film in the year of our lady 2008.

This is what anti-pornography feminists have fought, are fighting, and will continue to fight until pornography as we know it is burned down, root and branch.

Anyway, enough polemic. Let's get to the nitty gritty.

Anti-Porn feminism arose and is commonly seen as a major movement within the Second Wave of feminism. Major proponents of anti-porn feminism include Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, and Page Mellish.

Major arguments against pornography from a feminist perspective include but are not limited to:

Production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic coercion of performers. In particular, recent trends in pornography [increasingly rely on and depict increasingly violent and abusive treament of behavior (in particular, ""gonzo"" pornography,) which regardless of the supposed ""consent"" of the performers constitute rape and sexual assault.] (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5003155114018800220#)[Bonus: Penn and Teller are shits](http://www.counterpunch.org/dines06232008.html)



[""Pornographic films and magazines eroticize the sexual assault, torture, and exploitation of women.""](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por)
[""Pornography is a form of defamatory speech against women and can precipitate invidious forms of discrimination against women.""](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por)
[Pornography is ""sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible""](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por)

These arguments fall under the greater umbrella of the concept that pornography inherently treats women as sex objects, reinforcing a norm where women are passive sex receptacles to be used by dominant men. 

This sexual objectification leads, in this view to the rape and sexual assault of women- to quote Robin Morgan, """"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice."" In particular, viewing the degrading practices depicted in pornography, from the seemingly innocuous (money shots, interminable blowjob scenes) to the obvious (choking, unwarned and unlubricated anal sex, pinning or restraint of struggling women) is likely to lead to people become desensitized to such behavior. In particular, pornography is seen as increasing the chance that a consumer will believe in rape myths, in the same way that PUA does- no means yes, and she really *does* want it. MacKinnon: [""Pornography affects people's belief in rape myths. So for example if a woman says 'I didn't consent' and people have been viewing pornography, they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said. That when she said no, she meant yes. When she said she didn't want to, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home, that means she's a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience. Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitises people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you're a pornography consumer.""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety)
In short, pornography as it is presently is an inherent and essential component of rape culture, serving to turn sexual violence against women into normative sexual expression.

Pornography promotes a distorted and distasteful view of the human body and human sexuality, normalizing an impossible beauty standard for women while not holding men to any such standard, and a man-centric, man-dominant, man-pleasure focused view of the sexual experience that makes it impossible for women to enjoy a truly equal sexual relationship.

Of course, the harmful messages spread by pornography are not the only harm. The question is not, to quote Dworkin, ""Does pornography cause violence against women? Pornography *is* violence against women.""

Then, the violence is identified in three places: at the point of production, against the women in the pornography. At the point of consumption, against the women in the pornography (many have said that the biggest trauma for them is know that people are still viewing images of rapes perpetrated against them on porn sets)

And the third one is at the point of women seeing or catching a glimpse of the pornography. This one needs some explanation: speech can be a thing which refers to something else, i.e. ""table"" refers to a table, but speech can also be an act which directly changes the world, e.g. ""You're fired!"". When identifying pornography as direct harm against women viewers it's this second kind of definition used - pornography directly changes the experience of that woman, because it ties in with a lot of power structures to reach in and twist.

*with thanks to catherinethegrape*

In light of these arguments, anti-porn feminists view pornography as an inherently negative thing that does not deserve protection, promotion, or propagation.

**Well what about queer/feminist/yaoi/insert subcategory here?**

Those are so small a minority of sexually explicit depictions as a whole as to be useless except as a deflectionary tactic. On top of that, as previously stated many anti-porn feminists do not categorize many of those as ""pornography"" at all. Steinem defines a line between ""pornography"" which, as a word and a genre, is too tainted to use for the expression of genuine, mutual sexual satisfaction, and ""erotica."" Other anti-porn feminists dispute this claim, since we live in a patriarchal system and all erotic content is inherently poisoned thereof. Dworkin writes in opposition ""erotica is simply high-class pornography: better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer."" Ellen Willis puts it, ""In practice, attempts to sort out good erotica from bad porn inevitably comes down to 'What turns me on is erotica; what turns you on is pornographic."" Which is exactly what you are doing when you attempt to sort out your, ""good"" porn, from that other, ""bad"" porn.

Also, they're not created in a vaccuum and are affected by the current porn culture. You still see objectification, idealizing white lean bodies, racism, fetishizing the ""weird."" Same shit in a slightly less problematic sheath.

**What about porn production as an expression of personal sexuality? Is it inherently bad?**

Anti-porn feminists differ on this subject drastically- Steinem and similar would defend that as ""erotica"" while Dworkin and similar would condemn it as continuing to buy into a patriarchal system of sexual commodification and degradation.

**I don't agree with your definition of pornography**

Then find a different word to describe what you're talking about, because you don't get to define what words mean in this context, in the same way that women are a numerical majority but a sociological minority. Language is a limiting and confusing thing, and acceptance of this definition of pornography is *essential* for understanding what anti-porn feminists are talking about.

**But anti-porn is out of date with the emergence of the internet!**

If anything, the internet has made one of the inherent problems of pornography *worse-* the catering to the instant gratification of the increasingly dangerous desires of men. While the internet is to be applauded for allowing ""erotica"" to sprout and spread on a larger scale, the grand, grand majority of pornography has not changed- and if anything has gotten worse, especially considering the increasing sexualization of completely unconsenting victims whose private pictures are stolen.

**Well all media is tainted by patriarchal society. Why single out porn?**

""All media"" is not the same thing as porn, and does not have the same effect as porn. Sex is an incredibly important part of many people's lives, and acting as if our opinions and views on sex are not changed and affected by its most popular depiction is asinine. On top of that, oppression olympics is never the proper response to an argument like this. Porn is a major area of work because it *matters,* is *everywhere,* and, in the view of anti-porn feminists, is a *primary source* of rape culture and misogynistic views, as well as being *inherently* harmful to the women involved at every step of production and consumption.

**You're just a pru-**

Don't even start with that shit.

I've never been to Detroit or had any basis for a strong opinion on this topic, so in the past I just shrugged, made a mental note to be careful talking about this, and moved on. But after seeing [this article](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/06/17/detroit-takes-aim-at-its-pensioners/?utm_source=feedly) today, it *does* sound like an almost cartoonishly awful place by first-world standards, in ways that you don't have to be a racist to recognize.

Now I know I'm making a bit of a generalised statement but why did that thread have so much attention from people against beastiality (which is good of course) but the SRS community isn't concerned with the rights of animals being mass-slaughtered for consumption? 

I hope I'm not being one of *those* people but I sometimes get uncomfortable reading comments about eating meat, depending on how graphic or disrespectful the comment is, and I have seen a few of those (not many) around on SRS. I've seen animal rights being discussed in other SRS affiliated subreddits but more than often the response has been less than satisfactory for me. Arguments like ""they are biologically different than us"" or ""the lives and behaviours of animals can't be compared to those of humans"" remind me too much of historical 'scientific' arguments to justify sexism and racism.

Does anyone else think that we should be defending animal rights and fighting against ""speciesism"" in the same way that we do for other groups? And those who disagree, where does the distinction between humans and other animals come from in your mind? (I'm trying my best to not come off as judgemental here, sorry if it's being interpreted in that way. I know this is a touchy subject for many and I'm genuinly interested in having a discussion).

as you probably now, yesterday Secretary of Defense Panetta opened up all roles, including combat roles, to women in the US military.

A debate has followed on whether women should now be obligated to register with the Selective Service System. The SSS is a registry of all US citizen and resident non-citizens eligible for military conscription; it is obligatory for males age to register within 3 days of their 18th birthday, on the penalty of a fine and being denied certain things (most notably federal education loans).

So this debate is essentially whether American women of military age (for men it's currently 18-25) should be subject to military conscription (and thus have to join the register of potential conscripts); currently only ""male persons"" are subject to conscription.

A relevant thing to consider is the 1981 USSC ruling *Rostker v. Goldberg*, in which the Supreme Court found that:

&gt;The existence of the combat restrictions clearly indicates the basis for Congress' decision to exempt women from registration. The purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops. Since women are excluded from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided not to register them.

Debate!

I want to disregard the Reddit comments for now, since they are, overall, encouraging this type of violence.  I want to talk about this situation in particular.  Obviously I don't condone violence against women, but I want to ask about the merits (or lack thereof) in this video.  I also know that there might be details that aren't seen immediately (e.g. the boy may have actually been the bully, the girl was sticking up for herself, etc.), but I want to take the video at face value as though the title of the video (Girl bullies smaller student, he finally decides he's had enough) were true.

From the look of the video, if the title is to be believed, the girl is shoving the boy around and doesn't appear to have any intention of stopping.  The boy appears to be trying to get out of her grasp and, at least from my perspective, it looks like he's trying to restrain himself from hitting her (until the very end, obviously).  They look to be middle school students, and even though the fight seems to have started before the recording did, the fight goes on for at least thirty seconds and not a single teacher swoops in to break up the fight.  With the girl being noticeably bigger than the boy, besides running away, I don't see a lot of recourse that the boy might have had in that situation other than continue to get beaten up until a teacher came.

When I saw the video, I wasn't sure what to think (I saw it through /r/ShitRedditSays), because while I certainly don't condone violence against women, I wasn't sure what other choice the boy had in this situation than to take a swing to fend her off.  I felt that if he ran he would only face further bullying, whether it be from the girl or other people for ""having run away from a fight with a girl.""  I don't get any pleasure out of seeing this girl knocked out cold, but I'm conflicted with the merits of fighting back when the boy was clearly being beaten up.

However, in terms of tangible political changes, not much happened. Liberal politicians never threw their lot in with the protesters. The Tea Party (for example) can point to certain congressmen and say, ""We got those people elected"". The Occupy movement can't do that.

I was peripherally involved in the movement, but I'd like to talk about why the movement lost momentum in the way it did, and why it was unable to affect tangible, legislative change, and what can be done differently next time.

As an SRS user who is new, and doesn't post much, but really likes SRS, it's struck me how much the arguments that have been traditionally applied to SRS apply so easily to the Chick-fil-A debate.

I mean, the general argument for supporting this awful business is that those who now stand against Chick-fil-A are anti-free speech. The most common argument levied against SRS is that it is anti-free speech. Right?

But free speech only means that the government can't stop you from saying what you want to say. You can say whatever you want. It doesn't really matter (as a thing that **one** person says. When a large group starts to say something it can start to matter). 

Free speech doesn't mean that you can't get criticized, though. It doesn't mean that you can just say whatever you want and no one can say that want you're saying is bullshit.

And yet that seems to be the dominant chain of thought. That because this CEO is spewing hate-speech, and it's his right to do so, we should respect it. We should just let it be, free to roam in the un-criticized free speech pool, where all free speech is let be to frolic without fear of attack.

Huh? No it's not. I can condemn and attack anything anyone says, right? You can say what you want, sure, why not, but don't think that if you say something shitty I'm not gonna call it out for being shitty.

And isn't that what SRS is? It's really funny to me, the way this so perfectly fits with what SRS does. Sure, say the shitty things you want to say, but don't for a second think you're not going to get shit on it return.

I dunno. I guess the main point is that the Chick-fil-A thing has, for me, brought SRS into a new light. Do you guys also see the connection?",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_xphhl,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/xphhl/the_link_between_arguments_for_chickfila_and/,

I get what was wrong about that submission, but I find SRS intriguing because there are many interesting points of view that I am not exposed to. I would love to discuss stuff, but as I understand it SRS is just for circlejerking and this is for discussion.

I saw the SRS thread about [the Olympics](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/xeica/if_the_gymnasts_have_undergone_puberty_which_they/) and I am honestly curious about why people think being attracted to anyone under 18 makes you a pedophile. The reasoning behind that view just seems really problematic to me. 18 years is an arbitrary legal definition. So if you're attracted to a person who turns 18 in a day then you're a pedophile one day, but then tomorrow you won't be?

It just seems harsh and kind of unrealistic to expect that peoples biological urges will exactly conform to the legal age of consent in their jurisdiction. Personally I think a more useful definition of pedophilia is being attracted to people who haven't gone through puberty because you find juvenile physical features attractive.

I can only speak as a straight man (I don't know if there's a different term I'm supposed to use), but I have younger brothers and there have been a handful of times where I've been home from college and seen one of their friends and thought ""wow she is cute but in high school and most likely under 18, so she's out of bounds.""

I don't think that makes me a pedophile though. I am attracted to women, not little girls. And people grow and develop differently, so why is being attracted to a very young looking 20 year old because you think she looks like a 14 year old totally fine, but being attracted to a 16 year old because she looks like a 20 year old make you a pedophile?

It totally makes sense that we legally have to set some arbitrary standard, there's no good way to tell if someone is emotionally ready to have sex, but I think it's odd to say that anyone under 18 is a child and being attracted to people under 18 just needs one one term: 'pedophilia.' And I actually think it diminishes what is really horrible about pedophilia. What do you all think?

Note: I'm trying to having an honest discussion in good faith, so if I inadvertently said something offense please let me know instead of just telling me I'm a shitty person and banning me because I'd like to know.

Edit: I just want to say thanks for all the great comments and discussion. Despite what everyone says about SRS, this is the best (least-circlejerky) discussion I've had on reddit which is kind of ironic. I'm not sure how I feel about SRS itself, I think it might do more harm than good, I don't know, but everyone in this thread is assuming good faith and not being a dick, so thanks.

Edit 2: I can see now that making sure that children are protected from exploitation is more important than strictly following dictionary definitions. I had no idea that people used this distinction to shield them from facing consequences from their harming children. The distinction no longer seems relevant to me in this context at least, and I thank everyone for being patient and giving me a chance. Just remember that you can change people, so try not to give up even if it's frustrating.

A lot of you internet strangers, I've gained much respect for, and appreciate your existance on this earth. I also very much appreciate your opinions, which is why I'm doing this. This is one LONG-ASS post, I'm really only aware of that after I've finished haha, but I'd really appreciate you reading it, after all, I'm spilling my guts. Onwards then..

My therapist… Oh where do I begin? Well, I'll start with the positive. He's been my psychiatrist for over 5 years I think. He has been there for me, supportive, when I came out, when I was bullied at school, when I went through shit I shouldn't have gone through (cops harassing me, some crazy guy banging my head against the concrete because he *thought* I was the one who threw eggs at his house, when I was just a bystander) etc. He's married, old (50's?-60's?), has three kids, two sons one daughter, and is very wise. If you want to picture him in your mind, think of the shrink in the movie Running with Scissors (I know it's a book, I read it), but he looks just like the actor there. He looks like a sort of Santa Claus haha, mustache, chubby (makes me wonder if it's some kind of ""code"" older male therapists have about how they should look). He is caring and kind, and occasionally has his slips (drowsy eyes), but meh, I forgive him. He believes in God, and Jesus, but acknowledges that there's  lot of bullshit in the bible, especially in regards to homosexuality (something I admire about him, although I realize many people here won't agree because they're atheists, and that's ok, all the better). Anyway, I've gained a lot of respect for him over the years, and really value his input, he has a good set of morals and values, and a lot of knowledge about people… Or well, so I thought until a few weeks ago.

Now he always told be being gay was ok, etc. I can even tell him about the more intimate aspects of this and he seems to have no problem with it. But when I asked him *why* I was gay, and he told me  it was because of my mother, that she was so aggressive I ""seeked to appease her throbbing dick"". I was like ""maybe"", ""ok""… Then I asked him if this is why he thinks *all* gay guys become gay, and he told me yes. To him, girls can be bisexual/lesbians, but it's because their sexuality is fluid. Guys? Nah, only gay or straight, no if's or buts. A bisexual guy? Nah, he's lying to himself. Genetic/biological causes for homosexuality? Nah, bullshit. [Innate bisexuality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_bisexuality)? Nah, one of Freud's ""wrong"" theories, and Kinsey? haha no. etc. 

Homosexuality? **Mental illness.** Now this effed with my mind for many months.. I told him: ""but the AMA (american psychological association) ruled that out in the 1970's!"" His response: ""Ohh, it's because the leaders of the AMA were homosexual themselves. Generally psychologists believe it is a mental illness."" He just wouldn't let go of this, he still doesn't. THIS was when I truly started to pick up the very vague scent of shit emanating from him.

I tell him:""Well ""Doctor"", why don't you do your job and cure me of this so called ""illness""?"" He says:""There are uncurable illnesses, like diabetes."" Because homosexuality is just like diabetes right? RIGHT GUISE??

I decided to let it go for a few months. And then the conversation went to me asking him if he thought gays and lesbians could share TRUE, deep love. He went: ""oh I dunno about that"" Yes, he actually expressed disbelief that gays and lesbians could truly love each other the way man and woman can. This coming from a guy with various gay/lesbian patients mind you. At this point the shit really started to reek. He then said ""Man and woman having sex is a beautiful sight"" (Implying, of course, that gays and lesbians having sex is gross and unnatural. Wait.. not lesbians of course ;) , because MY PEEENISS) 

I really wanted to punch him in the face at this point. I mean here was a guy I trusted, I cared for. And he's practically telling me I was an ""inferior form"" of a human (of course he can't see this through his shitlord glasses). The next week I was pretty much psychologically destroyed. Crying in the shower, questioning my existence, etc.. That's the thing isn't it? he's just being a selfish shitlord, not even doing his job right, seeing things from his patient's perspectives etc??

No no, to him, what is ""natural"" is men with women. They ""compliment"" one another. (his actual words). I ask him if he really believes we are ""naturally"" straight. He's like yeah. I'm like ""why? if the human mind is born essentially blank, with no attraction to either gender, you think hormones actually make you straight from the get-go?"" ""Yess"" (hesitates for a bit) Me: ""You actually think, medical professional that you are, hormones change your mind into thinking one sex is attractive and the other isn't?""

His answer, after a pause: ""Yess, they make you develop certain characteristics (you know aggressive male, passive female, that bullshit, more on this later), and again they ""compliment"" one another."" (How he can't see his sexism, his essentialism, is beyond me.. Oh wait, it's cuz he's a SAWSCM, right SRS?

Anyway, come next session, I ask him if he was a homophobe before learning about psychology, being honest he told me yes, but when he started studying medicine, and learning *why* homosexuals are the way they are, he understood and stopped being a homophobe. (Idiot.. there's a difference between empathy and pity)

For a person who vehemently believes homophobes are just men who are repressing their homosexual feelings. I don't understand how he can't see in himself his own homophobia, and therefore homosexuality. (Men NATURALLY bisexual? CRAZY TALK! I'm not bisexual! NO, no homosexuality here in your SWASCM psychiatrist? no way, I'm not one of *them*. psst they're my little patients! don't lump me with them! hahaha!)

Onto his sexism (and what I guess is the origin of his shitty attitude against gays). I showed him a recent article in my local newspaper about some 20 local 8-10 yo girls attending a ""one (sexist) woman's conference"" about ""how to be a *lady*"" Topics discussed include: ""What a man expects from a woman"", ""Setting the table in a fashionably manner"", and other such shits. I tell him ""Do you think this is right? It disgusts me"". He says ""YES it is right, it is good!!"" my jaw dropped at this point. I ask him if he would want his daughter to attend such a conference and he's like ""Yes. Women have to learn to be **ladies**, it is the only way they'll be happy. I mean have you seen my female patients? How unhappy they are?"" (cue in my deep fear for his patients) ""Men and women have to treat each other differently, it's the key to order and happiness.""

Then he tells me one of his inspiring life stories: ""I was walking in my son's high school the other day, and I overheard a guy call his female friend ""dude"". THAT is so wrong! It will only bring chaos! CHAOS!!"" Because men and women have to treat each other like different species right? THAT's the way to gain respect among genders.. *throws up*

Next session I confront him more about this, call him out on it. Ask him ""Do you think women belong in the kitchen and house? That's all they're meant to do right? haha. (sarcasm)"" He tells me ""Call my wife, she's going to be in the kitchen, ask her if she's not happy"". (I'm like ""holy fuck, holy fuck, who have I been seeing these past 6 years? what is GOING ON!??"") Of course she's going to say she's happy, she grew up in sexist Mexico! That's what she's been taught all her life will make her happy! Because of SHITLORDS LIKE YOU!! ARRGGGH!!!!

Here are the parts that really confuse me, I'm not sure if he's right or not, if he's trying to poison me with his sexism or not, I need your help SRS! I'm really sorry if it offends you I'm confused about this, but I'm learning. I'm a 22 yo (todays my bday!) gay guy who is only recently opening up to the idea of being with women:

He has told me women have this ""instinctive emotionability (?)"", this is why they become mothers, and are ""naturally"" inclined to do so. Thing is *I* also have this, I mean I REALLY want to have children, and if I could I wouldn't work to the point that I'd be with them all day. Thing is, I'm male. When I told him this, he jokingly (or not?) suggested we start hormone therapy. Do you guys think it's true? Women having a ""instinctive emotionability""? Because on my time here in SRS, I think all humans have this, it's just that society has made the male believe such feelings are wrong and should be hidden. Am I right? Is he right?

When I told him about [Andrea Dwrokin's book Intercourse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercourse_\(book\)), and how sexism/rape culture could possibly arise from the simple act of penetrative sex. How so many men see women as objects to be used, how violent some of them are to them when having sex. How close to 50% of women have some ""rape fantasy"" .He told me my views of sex with women were pretty twisted. (I acknowledge this.) He asked me ""Do you know what a woman enjoys about having sex? **Feeling WHOLE.**"" In my mind I was like ""is he right? he can't be right? nah, this sounds kinda wrong… I'm going to SRSDiscussion."".

So help me SRS. What do you think? What do you women enjoy about sex? Is it really ""feeling whole""? Can't be right, right? It's just him with his bloated ego saying ""women can't be whole without MAH PENISSS"" right? I mean what about lesbians? What the hell?

And here's the delicious part: he doesn't believe he's sexist. (Me? Arbitrary, white, educated medical professional, w/family, following the path society places before me, WRONG?? hahaha) No no, he's not the sexist here, *I*, SRS ,your fellow OP am the sexist here. (his words.. and this is why I'm starting to feel crazy..)

I think his veil of shit needs to be raised. He has grown so comfortable living in this sexist mexican society, he cannot even see the sexism and homophobia in him. He seems to think all he knows about psychology is right, and he's not sexist at all, yet he seems to forget he went to a sexist catholic university in the 1970's.

Please SRS, give me your opinions, help me help him SEE the truth. For my sake, his sake, and most importantly, the sake of his patients. PLEASE. I have placed my trust in this guy, cared for him, and he has thrown me in for a loop many times, to the point of tears, suffering and pain. I don't want his LGBT, hell, non-SAWCSM patients to go through this bullshit.

 I will be sharing this page with him, so let it all out. Let him know what you seriously think of him. If you just wanna comment about one part, do so, if you want to comment about the whole thing, do so. Just PLEASE do something. Because evidently he's not listening to me. He needs proof from other people of his shitlordliness. And also, I need some of your help to see the light. (women wanting to be whole when having sex? wat? so they're not whole people to begin with? I guess men are though right? because penis envy!! hahaha &lt;_&gt; )

At the center of their misunderstanding is a grain of truth: there are more white people on welfare in the US than there are people of color. If you're familiar with the history behind the ""white"" identity, you might know that its creation in the US was a strategy successfully used by the elite to prevent white indentured servants and black slaves from organizing. Privileging whites just enough to create the illusion of white supremacy ensured that the relationship between white people and black people would be competitive and antagonistic instead of cooperative. This aforementioned form of white denial is a sign of how effective this strategy is to this day. White people face fewer obstacles to achieving social mobility, but that doesn't change how for the most part it's still a myth.

A perception I have of many middle-class white progressives is that  we still largely buy into the myth of a monolithic white identity. Scapegoating poor white Southerners as being the real racists is the easiest method of avoiding questions about our own racism. If you really think poor white people are *that* much more racist than we are, consider the way in which assertions of white supremacy have been motivated by *necessity* instead of hate. White people in the US who are middle class or higher don't need to think about what gives us supremacy, because we already enjoy the class privilege our whiteness entitles us to. It's easier for us to cover up our racism, because we don't stand to lose anything from doing so. White Southerners really are more openly racist, no one is denying that. But if the people who are most conscious of white privilege are the ones who don't have it, doesn't it make sense that the people who are most conscious of their *own* racism are the ones who benefit the least from it?

Obviously, I'm a long way from suggesting that SRS should be more tolerant of racism coming from poor white people. Until I digressed on this subject in particular, this post used to be titled ""should SAWCSM include class privilege?"", and in a way this is still the question I present to you all. Making fun of working class white culture is still prevalent among white liberals because we presume the existence of a single egalitarian white culture. Concerns about this are often derailed by (correctly) pointing out their relative acceptance of open bigotry. The dismissal of other white subcultures is often spared the treatment accorded to them by cultural relativity because we aren't considerate of how our socioeconomic class separates us. This is in large part because we directly benefit from ignoring this separation. If you're a white progressive who has ever wondered why the white working class eagerly continues to support a political party that so obviously works against their best interests, consider how your attitude supports the mythology that keeps that phenomenon alive.

Hey SRS. I'm a fucking scumbag. This isn't a circlejerk, I am honestly fucking awful. I'm a privileged white male who, until recently, has bitched and moaned about how life hard is for white males. Think of any awful shit you've seen here; I didn't write it, but I might as well have. I used to be one of those guys that always shouted ""lol rape,"" even to women. ""lol fag"" to guys. ""lol n-----"" to blacks. I couldn't have been more offensive. I once had a girl take interest in me (what was she thinking? I FUCKING SUCK.) and she confided in me her darkest secret, that she was non-forcibly raped. Since she wasn't tied down, gagged, and murdered, my infant man-child brain thought ""lol pity points. cry rape much?"" and while I told her that it must have been awful, I never believed her. At the end of our relationship I called her out on it. All she could do was cry.


I'm asking for a help, begging, I'm only nineteen years old and I'm the worst person I've ever known. Think of every despicable thing you've seen on reddit, that's me. I've asked people whose family members have died in 9/11 what the ""big deal was."" Also, not only have I seen CP, I've saved and posted some; even worse I've touched myself to it. I mean, I honestly can't think of someone more fucked in the head than I. I've complained about how men are eventually going to be ""taken over"" by women, been Nice GuyTM , learned PUA shitfest techniques, and have probably emotionally damaged dozens of people in my poop wake of poop. Not to mention that the second anyone has some retort to my idiocy I would reply ""NOT LOL.""


I'm coming to you for change... I don't deserve it, but I'd like to prove I can change. I've been reading SRS for a few weeks and I'm still nowhere near the level of compassion that a human being has. It's been difficult, reading threads on here and thinking, ""Yea, what's wrong with that?"" I've finally come around to being able to manage find poop in the worst of threads, but that's not enough to be able to respect myself.
I'm trying to change, I am. The real reason for posting, aside from the confession of my awfulness, is that I was wondering if there is anything I can read or watch or listen to in order to grow some compassion or decency? I've never hated myself more than in the weeks I've been to SRS, and that's good; I need to change my awful ways. I'm not asking for pity and you can ask me anything and you can benned me and you can hate me, but I needed to post this...

In this past year I have also began running with social justice groups, and slowly became aware of the power and impact cultural imagery and words can have on the world (An awareness compounded thanks to a binge reading session of every SRSDiscussion [EFFORT] post here) and because of that, I realized that the nature of my employment has a real and tangible malicious impact on the world.

Currently I am actively seeking employment elsewhere (not just because of those reasons, but also because my experience with the porn company is manipulative, insecure and exploitive as fuck to me personally.) but in the meantime I need to pay the rent.

Just to hear from ya'll, how can I sneakily improve the written content of porn to be more female &amp; sex positive?  Specifically when writing;

- Descriptions of porn videos
- Descriptions of the women on the site
- Promotional material telling customers why to buy our products.

Honestly, the container of the fact that it's a porn site means that it can't be fully progressive (one of our sister sites has the word ""Tranny"" in the title, for pete's sake) and the demands of the jobs means that I have to work on a pace where it's difficult to be fully conscious of what I'm writing, but I'd figure it would be at least interesting to hear SRS's input on the whole thing.

I'd like to take this opportunity to emphasize a few points about SRSD.

Firstly, SRSDiscussion is a space for debate from a progressive, feminist, anti-racist, LGBTQ-positive perspective. It is not a place to discuss r/ShitRedditSays, despite the name. While it is true that SRSD was started by people from SRS, these are two different spaces. 

Following on from this, please keep in mind that - while this is a place to debate - concern trolling, circlejerking, harassment or personal attacks will not be tolerated. Furthermore, if you are openly against the views of this subject and do not demonstrate that you are willing to change your mind, you **will** be asked to leave. Inflammatory comments, attacks directed at the mods or at other SRSD users, comments which are racist/homophobic/bigoted/misogynistic etc. will be deleted, with or without warning. If you misstep and break one of the rules, you will be warned once. If you do it again, you will be banned. However, you are free to appeal your ban via [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SRSDiscussion). Civility is expected of everyone here, but if your post is particularly opposed to the views of this subreddit, don't expect to be let off lightly. The use of the [tone argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/o04z9/thoughts_on_tone_argument/) is not very well received. 

With that said, come with an open mind and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the discussions we're having.

In the book, it mentions that he hit one of his girlfriends when he was a lot younger, and how he was a complete jerk to a few of the women in his life. Hitting a woman is completely inexcusable to me, though these things all happened over thirty years ago, and I can only hope that he has changed in his life since then.

In commemoration of reaching +5000 subscribers (:D!) and due to the higher concentrations of concern trolling we've been seeing here lately (D:), I've taken it upon myself to answer meta questions about SRSDiscussion from the community in a series called Open Modmailbags. 

**What This Is**

Every other week or so (or whenever I feel like we need one) I will be putting up a meta post that will contain

* At least one good exchange/post we've had on Modmail, just to give you guys a glimpse into what goes on behind the scenes. 
* Mod concerns over certain topics. Every once in a while (like this week for example) we'll have like 5 different threads on the same topic (rape) and almost all of them are concern trolley. I'll consolidate a mod response to this and link relevant effort posts and discussions from the past to catch everyone to speed.

The comments section is your space to ask questions such as 

* Why was a certain topic removed?
* Why was I/another user warned for this comment?
* What do the mods think of my suggestion X, Y, Z?


**What This Is Not**

This space does not mean a relaxation of the rules. All sidebar rules still apply here. Mods will remove derailing comments or comments that don't belong, such as:

* Creating an alt to ask why you were banned. Use modmail.
* Meta discussion about SRS. Use /r/SRSMeta
* Demanding/haranguing individual mods to answer your questions when they are in obvious bad faith and,
* Trying to start discussions on social justice issues--just use regular SRSD for that.

I can only answer for the mod actions that I've taken myself--other mods may not have the time nor inclination to answer your questions. Don't take this to mean that we're ignoring you. If you have a really pressing question or concern, modmail is still your best bet of getting a response.

That being said, I hear the criticisms on how unforgiving SRSD can be towards those unfamiliar, and I'm hoping this open dialogue will encourage the shyer SRSers and newer users to participate and ask more questions. If you are privileged, this can be an incredibly useful space to you as long as you are humble and approach SRSD as a learning station. If you are a member of a marginalized group, remember that this space is yours to cultivate as well. So onto the actual content!

**Modmail Bag**

[This](http://i.imgur.com/I8iNQ.png) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/E61KM.png) are good ways to appeal a ban, especially if you're a poster we don't know. Generally we try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but since we have a lot of concern trolls we can get kind of trigger happy with the ban button to prevent certain threads from exploding and becoming unsalvageable. If that happens, a good attitude and a clear explanation for why you think you were banned with an apology will go a long way. 

**Mod Concerns**

* We've had a couple of really shitty rape threads lately. Please make yourself familiar with [our effort post on rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/oaksx/effort_debunking_rape_misconceptions/), particularly the section on false rape accusations.
* Avoid questions on hypothetical situations if you can, because they generally are useless to talk about in a social justice context. Hypothetical situations can be twisted into supporting different arguments depending on who's setting the hypotheticals, and it's just better avoided altogether if you want to avoid a string of ""What's your actual concern?"" Frame your question in terms of facts or a real situation.
* Please use the report button liberally. I waded into two threads today that were full of report-worthy comments but only a couple of reports. I promise that we do see the reported comments and 99% of the time we do remove them!

Lately I've read a lot of SRS and while I don't agree with every view people there seem to have, I agree with the general premise that hateful, stupid comments get upvoted on reddit every day because the community at large agrees on certain hateful views. However, I see a lot of talk about this thing called ""bio-truth,"" which is a label that basically gets applied to any post which cites differences between men and women as justification for any inequality in how society treats them. I agree that it's shitty to say, for instance, that the reason women don't make as much money in the work force is because they aren't as motivated as men because men are biologically programmed to be the hunters/bread winners/main providers. For one thing, it's demonstrably false because there are all kinds of examples of women who work much harder and get less pay then men who don't work as hard and it has nothing to do with biology and everything to do with privilege. However, I don't think that every single difference between men and women is bullshit. To give an example, I was listening to the Godless Bitches podcast a while back and they were talking about how maybe the reason more men are interested in casual sex compared to women is that men are more likely to achieve orgasm from one encounter with a new partner, whereas most women will probably require multiple encounters with an attentive partner to get the same result. The argument that they derived from this is that even in feminism there has to be an honest assessment of the differences between men and women, because the differences are real and sometimes you'll see inequalities in things like who is in demand for a casual sex encounter and who is in supply, and there isn't necessarily anything nefarious going on when the m4w or m4m casual encounters sections on craigslist are very different places than the w4w or w4m ones.
So after that long introduction my question is this: Is it always shitty to cite biological differences between men and women as an explanation for something?

They first went through the whole ""feminism would get what it wanted if it was nicer about things"" and ""women should be paid less because babies."" Okay, pretty bad but unfortunately I've heard all that before. 

Then, they started talking about limiting reproduction to people who were healthy and of a certain socio-economic status in order to raise a child. Basically as I understood their reasoning, people aren't responsible enough to look after their child and the child will have a shitty life, therefore in terms of total suffering, it's best to limit reproduction and have it so the child never existed. (EDIT: If there is pregnancy, then abortion.)

I tried to veer into another topic as soon as possible, but here were some of the counter arguments I came up with

- playing God with a few factors: like eugenics, you're simply restricting reproduction based on what *you* think is wrong. In your situation, a parent who dies a year after birth is even worse than a poor child. But how would you know in advance?

- the issue shouldn't be about people being too poor to raise children, but how and why people are too poor to raise children. as a society we're probably doing something wrong.

- the idea of abortion as a perfect solution and ""Plan B""- and not the awful choice and operation it is for couples or mothers- is horrifying. 

This was absolutely infuriating; the whole libertarian, utilitarian, greater-good bullshit and having Reddit's views incarnate in some good friends of mine. Plus (although perhaps this explains their privileged viewpoints), they're Ivy League SAWCMs- they have the resources and time to understand, but refuse to. 

Anyway, am I wrong? Can reproduction be considered less than a right? When has limiting or forcing reproduction not been part of a totalitarian or brutal regime? And why is this viewpoint so infuriating, other than that I like sex and feminism?

I had previously thought that I had achieved some kind of liberal oneness with the universe but this forum has educated me about how much of a shitlord I was and I'm thankful for that.  I'm not hinting that I want any cookies for meeting the minimum standard of decency, just letting you know ;).  I would also like to note that I never post here because I understand that my two cents are not required and I am just here to learn, so if I mess up please let me know and I will adjust accordingly.

As I have learned more and more here in SRSD, I started to notice things about the online atheist community in general.  Sexism and racism abound.  Over time it became like getting punched in the face every time someone referred to a woman that they didn't agree with as a ""bitch"".

I decided to point this out to the communities I was active in.  I was met, surprisingly, with resounding resistance from everyone.  When I pointed out racism, I was called a bigot.  When I pointed out misogyny, I was informed that ""Meredith Brooks reclaimed the word 'bitch' in the 90s"" so I should stop complaining.  I know that Lady Gaga uses it freely and that's fine, because she's reclaiming it.  But if a guy uses it to insult a conservative woman he disagrees with and then the ladies applaud him, isn't that a major issue?  Aren't they supporting the patriarchy?

Long story short, I was quickly dogpiled by everyone and I could not keep up.  I stopped communicating with any of them and I find myself without an online home and a disturbing message about the atheist community.

The most bothersome thing of all is that they kept repeating, in the face of all my arguments, that ""atheism"" meant just that: no theism.  So they were just a ""no god"" group, and NOTHING ELSE.  That they were not required to be progressive.  They were not required to think about racism or sexism.   In fact, I was told that by telling them that they should be more progressive I was trying to spread my own ""religion"".  This notion is abhorrent to me.

Having no religion should make you even more free to examine rational thought and not treat everyone like crap!  How can people just hit each other in the face with a dictionary and say ""Look at the definition of atheism!  There's nothing in there about being a good person!""  

This is a gigantic problem.  How can I combat this?  Am I completely wrong?  Don't atheists have a duty to be more progressive and not cling to the biases of their upbringing?

EDIT: Thank you for the input.  I've learned quite a bit.  You are witnessing a bit of a deconversion.  I'm still an atheist but I'm going to stop thinking that atheism is the answer to all problems...atheists can be terrible people as well and religion (or lack thereof) doesn't automatically lead to enlightenment.

EDIT2: Thank you again.  I'd like to clarify that while I have seen this problem in larger forums like /r/atheism and the National Atheist Party subpages on Facebook, I was initially referring to a problem I had experienced in some local, relatively small atheist groups in the American South.  In fact, my approach to them was ""I see this issue EVERYWHERE and you guys are no exception, so what is up with that?""  Of course, the reaction was terrible and in retrospect I probably could have approached it differently.  When it all comes down to it, as many of you have pointed out, people may change religious affiliation, but if they were raised to be bigots they may just continue to be bigots.

EDIT3: It has been pointed out that ""decent"" can mean many different things depending on one's system of beliefs.  I am thinking that I probably meant ""progressive"" as in ""do atheists have a responsibility to be more progressive?""

Usually it is in references to cases, real or imaginary, in which women are portrayed as behaving in an unreasonable manner. Sometimes, the assessment of unreason is justified, but nevertheless, I find myself uncomfortable with the broad swipes with which the term is used.

I wanted to get some perspectives from you all on the ways in which the term is problematic and to grasp the scope of the problem. The issues I see are these, though I may be missing some:

1) The term simultaneously stigmatizes and misrepresents mental illness, though it's used often enough that for some I suspect there is a semantic decoupling between the term and actual ideas of mental illness (not that this excuses the use of the term).

2) The term is sometimes used to describe women that do not meet the expectations and demands imposed upon them by men.

3) The term is tainted by its frequent and broad use in describing women.

Thoughts? I know that I've seen people write a few times that they also had issues with this word, but I wanted some help getting some thoughts together about it so that I can call people out when I wade back into the shitstorm that is Reddit. You all know the common rebuttals to an objection to terms like ""crazy"" so I won't rehash them here.

EDIT: I think another issue of the term is its use as manipulation and enforcement of patriarchal values—this is something I just spent some time writing in the ""sane girlfriend advice animal"" thread, which I see as particularly relevant:

Use of the term ""crazy"" often establishes a group of men as saying ""hey, girls—there's a cool girls club—if you just comment and say that you would totally say this when you come across a stash of porn, or if you just say you looove porn so much, we'll shower you with attention and praise!"" Even this wouldn't be that bad if there weren't an entire history of societies having this sort of thing on an institutional level, primarily manipulating women to the benefit of men. The other advice animals do not do this. They set up an expectation in the reader, and then play on the reader's expectations with the punch line. The sane girlfriend meme is not funny unless you, on some level, buy into some of these views on women. It's only funny if you read the first line, expect ""oh man, girl would blow up at me! women are crazy etc"" and then think to yourself ""wow, girl wants to have porn sex? epic win!"" Both having that expectation and playing to that expectation are, in themselves, misogynistic.

Edit 2: I think what sparked my interest in making this thread was [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r9773/is_it_wrong_for_a_guy_to_use_coupons_in_a_date/) AskReddit post. A woman made a big deal of her date using a coupon to save $20 on a $200 dinner for which he paid in whole. She reacted extremely negatively and appeared to take offense. The replies: ""Nope, bitch is crazy"" was highly upvoted followed by a slew of what really looked like special snowflakes: ""I would be turned on if my date used a coupon.""

So I'm having doubts—I don't think the above comments are okay, and the special snowflaking definitely pushed me even further along in that sentiment, but I may be hypersensitive to phenomena that may appear to be special snowflake.

Sexual interest and emotional attachment are separate but linked phenomena. All people have had some experience with one or the other or both. How you identify on a sexual interest/emotional attachment spectrum is different and separate from your sexual orientation.

Check out this handy-dandy graph: [I will be making a colour-blind friendly version soon.]

Edit: Some people seem confused by the graph so I'll explain. You are supposed to plot yourself on the x and y axis, and see where you intersect regarding labels. That's where the glossaries come in - they explain the terms used on the x and y axis' (I was trying to be precise). **Please read the glossary first.** After you have found yourself you can take a look at the graph from the perspective of seeing how the different terms intersect - most of them do to a certain degree and it's important to recognise how they are different and how they intersect if you are going to be having a discussion with someone about sexual preferences and try to understand where that person might lie. For example: If someone says they are Demisexual, that means they can lie anywhere in the green area of the graph, so it's important to not make assumptions about their preferences for types of sexual activity.) Hope that helps.

[Sexual Interest and Emotional Attachment]( http://imgur.com/YAkfB)

Most people will experience either sexual interest or emotional attachment before feeling both. Primary emotional attachment is the top half of the chart. Primary sexual interest is the bottom half.

**Glossary:**

* Emotional attachment: An emotional connection with another person. It does not have to be romantic or love-based.
* Sexual interest: An erotic attraction toward another person. It does not need to be based purely on sexual intercourse.
* Primary emotional attachment: When emotional attachment is experienced prior to forming an erotic attraction.
* Primary sexual interest: When sexual interest is experienced prior to forming an emotional connection.

* Sexual abstinence: Lack of sexual activity. This may or may not include lack of masturbation.
* Masturbation: Causing sexual pleasure to yourself.
* Monoamory: Fulfilling sexual or romantic desires with one partner. (In the graph this refers to only the sexual aspect)
* Polyamory: Fulfilling sexual or romantic desires with more than one partner. (In the graph this refers to only the sexual aspect)
* Multiamory: Fulfilling sexual desire with more than one person at each encounter.
* Eros: A type of love that is generally characterised as “romantic love” and separate from love derived from other relationships.
* Storge: All love that is not Eros. Most commonly: love for a friend.
* Apatheia: Suppression of emotional attachment. Usually seen as a positive trait. (Think vulcans)
* Dispassion: Absence of emotional attachment. Usually experienced about people unknown to you.
* Misanthropy: Hatred for a person or multiple people. Usually used colloquially to describe hatred for the human race in general.

* Celibacy: Purposefully refraining from sexual activity. This does not preclude the celibate person from engaging in emotional intimacy and is usually seen as a positive trait. It may or may not include refraining from masturbation.
* Autosexual: Sexual desire toward oneself and not others. Edit: It has been pointed out to me that Autosexual can also be a term of sexual orientation towards oneself. It is not on the sexual orientation chart but it should be noted that it can be considered an orientation as well as a sexual preference.
* Serial monoamory: Having multiple partners over a lifetime, but only one partner at any given time.
* Serial polyamory: Having successive multiple partners over a lifetime, and more than one partner at any given time.

* Demisexual: Emotional attachment of some kind is required to create a sexual interest in another person. See: Primary emotional attachment.
* Casual sex: Eros is not required, and often specifically rejected, in order to have sexual encounters with another person.

**Please note:** Sexuality is fluid and changes over time. There is also a lot of overlap in the sexual activity axis. This graph is meant as a general guideline for understanding sexuality and emotional attachments.
*******************
**Sexual Orientation**

Sexual orientation is on a separate spectrum from the sexuality and emotional attachment chart, so most people will identify with both to varying degrees. Sexual orientation is related to gender expression and gender identity, as well as interest in sexual activities.

Check out this chart for more:

Edit: **Read the glossary if the chart is confusing.** If you are still confused ask me a question and I'll try my best to answer it. I purposefully tried to make the chart non-normative, so I understand it could be confusing for some people.

[Sexual Orientation Chart - Needs work. Will be back soon.]

Check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/opzyo/effort_asexuality_101/) for more information about asexuality.

Glossary:

* Gender Identity: How a person identifies on the gender spectrum.
* Unigender: Identifying with one of the genders on either end of the spectrum.
* Genderqueer: Identifying somewhere ~~in between the two ends of the~~ else (oops: sorry:/) on the spectrum. Non-normative gender identity.
* Femme: Presenting with traditionally feminine characteristics. Look up: *Feminine*.
* Homme: Presenting with traditionally masculine characteristics. Look up: *Masculine*.
* Trans\*: Identifying differently on the gender spectrum than what you were assigned at birth
* Cis: Identifying the same on the gender spectrum as what you were assigned at birth.

* Homosexual: Attracted to others of the same gender.
* Heterosexual: Attracted to those of the opposite gender.
* Skoliosexual: Attracted to only those who are genderqueer. (*Be careful using this label, as it can be seen as fetishising by some people.*)
* Bisexual: Attracted to both genders on either end of the spectrum. Critics of this term say that it erases genderqueer identity. 
* Monosexual: Attracted to one gender only. See: Homosexual and Heterosexual.
* Polysexual: Attracted to more than one gender. This does not necessarily include attraction to all gender identities, but doesn’t preclude it either.
* Pansexual: Attraction to all gender identities along the spectrum. This does not mean that gender is not seen (ie: gender-blind), but merely that all genders are attractive.
* Pomosexual: Rejection of labels of sexual orientation.

I hope this was informative. It is meant to be a Basic 101 post, so nuances and in-depth discussion and critique of terms was not attempted. I also took the most common ones I could find, I certainly doubt that I included *everything* on the sexuality and sexual orientation spectrums.

Obama will be a better president for human rights in the US than Romney. There is no question of this. Minority groups will absolutely receive more attention to their respective needs, and we won't be stuck with a guy who browns up to go on Univision.

I get all that, it's totally not in dispute. *HOWEVER*

Obama is still supporting horrible human rights violations around the world. He has not closed Gitmo, he has not supported Palestine, he has not scaled down our military-industrial complex or reduced military spending by any appreciable amount, he's authorized drone strikes that have massacred civilians, and so on.

What's wrong with me voting for a third party candidate? Regardless of the fact that I live in a state that's blue no matter what, shouldn't we try to send a message of what ideology we support and how we want a truly progressive future? Isn't standing up to the status quo and saying ""Sorry, this bullshit isn't fucking good enough"" something we should all be willing to do?

I just want some viewpoints here. I do understand the opposing view, and it's certainly not wrong and I can't fault anyone for holding it, I just don't think I'm wrong either.

Several times I have heard straight edge people slam medical marijuana patients and those with mental illnesses for using prescription medication for their conditions.

Many mental illnesses are neurochemical in nature and respond favorably to medication - bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety come to mind. Without medication many patients experience a drastically decreased quality of life. Personally my mother has benefited for years from antidepressants, and I thank Lexapro for saving my life. Some mental illnesses can also be treated by medical marijuana, depending on the severity, strain, etc. Based on this I think it's ableist to attack patients with mental illness for using prescription medication and marijuana, just as it would be to attack cancer patients for using chemo.

Additionally, I think there's a class effect at work here, based on my experience. When I was using the Pill and antidepressants to treat my PMS, anxiety, and depression, I was spending about $50 a month for my prescriptions, even with insurance. Now that I treat all of them with medical cannabis, I only paid a $70 yearly fee + $10 a month. With other medication, I would be paying $600 a year for medications, plus doctor visits. With medical cannabis, I pay $190 a year, including one doctor visit. Insurance doesn't come into play for cannabis. Therefore it seems to me that MMJ is beneficial because it allows those with lower incomes and no insurance to get medical help for a wide variety of ailments, at under 1/3 the cost of insurance-covered medication.

Of course, these numbers will vary depending on one's area and local laws, but I think the math and logic roughly holds up across medical states in the US.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_10rm2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/10rm2j/is_straight_edge_ableist_and_classist/,

I'm a trans lady pro-dominatrix (I do it for money and for personal recreation.) who has been in the scene for a while. I identify lesbian, though my job requires I work with men.


**Definitions and Disclaimers:**

A lot of this is anecdotal understandings as someone who has participated in the community for a while. I've observed various sections of most communities, and about the only one I'm unfamiliar with is the gay male community.  I don't claim to know how that part of the community works.

BDSM needs to be defined, first off. BDSM simply means bondage and discipline, and sadism and masochism. By itself, this includes anything as simple as handcuffs and riding crops to fullblown lifestyles. The lifestyle tends to include a different S&amp;M, though. Slave and master/mistress.

There is a difference between the terms top and bottom, dominant and sub, and slave and master/mistress. Dominant and sub are simple enough. The dominant person is the one in control of the scene, and the sub is the one that is following orders or not in control of the scene. Slave and master/mistress is similar, but implies permanence or a relationship outside the bedroom. Top and bottom aren't so clearly defined. In BDSM contexts bottom usually refers to the person being tied up. It can also be construed as the person who's being penetrated, which I'll get to in more depth later.

There are also levels of engagement with BDSM. The people who represent the community and talk about it the most often *do not represent the majority of people who participate in BDSM.* The most engaged and into it are different than the people who do it as a mere sex act in the bedroom, than the people who make it a life style, and than the people who do it casually. The people who actively get into the “scene” face-to-face are not by any stretch of imagination the majority of people.

I am going to use generalizations and wiggle words. These are all primarily anecdotes and my experiences. If yours different, fantastic. You should share them too.


**Myths and Misconceptions:**

First, the myth that “the sub has all the power.” This is a very dangerous and pervasive myth that people tell to feel better about the BDSM community and practice. It is false. It is ridiculously patently false to anyone who has actually participated and thinks for five seconds. The sub can negotiate a scene, and they, hopefully, have an established safe word. That is the limit to their power. The dominant partner is expected to follow those guidelines and stop if the safe word is said. They don't have to. When you are tied up and locked down, you are legitimately helpless and powerless and utterly dependent on your dominant to be trust worthy and to meet the basic guidelines for a minimally decent human being.

What I'm saying is certain dominants will renegotiate scenes in the middle of them and often use coercive tactics to do things beyond the prenegotiated lines. They will prime someone with certain words or actions, and scenes often times go across the line. The phrase “the sub has all the power” is blatantly wrong and harmful. It gives people the false sense of security that a scene can stop whenever they want it to. It is up to the dominant to be a good person and stop the scene. That doesn't happen far too often. (Though, once is far too often in my opinion.) I've even heard of dominants refuse a safeword once or twice to try something and see if someone wants to keep going. 

Second, the myth that “the real world doesn't follow into the bedroom” and the converse “what happens in the bedroom doesn't follow me into the world.” I've never worked with someone where this is true. People sub and dom/me for reasons from the real world. Most people can figure out what those reasons are, some don't really know. It's no coincidence that there are many more female subs than there are male subs. And most people have their submissive or dominant nature reinforced by experiences in the bedroom. (And occasionally, their experience is bad, unpleasant, or just really strange to them, so much as they switch entirely to going pure dominant.)

[This is most obvious in Christian Domestic Discipline.](http://christiandomesticdiscipline.com/home.html)

The best people to see this in action with are switches (people who sub and dom/me.) Depending on how a switch's day goes, if you know them, you can usually guess what they're going to be in the mood for. I don't think this is a particular secret among switches.

[\(These next two points deal with something someone has thankfully written on quite well, though I'll voice how I see it too, even if there is a lot of agreement.\)](http://delvingintodeviance.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/the-devaluation-of-male-submission/)


**In Regards to Women's Sexuality:**

Going back to the earlier comment about how bottom also tends to mean the partner who is penetrated. Aside from the general lesbian erasure and erasure of women who dislike penetration that holds, it also is reflected quite wildly in the BDSM community and just people in general. Go to literotica or some random mainstream pornsite. Look for videos where the female dominant is the one who orgasms.

Oh, they're out there. Some are even really, really good, but they're noticeably rarers than finding videos and stories of a male dominant orgasming.

The point is that female sexuality is considered vulnerable. Women feeling pleasure is considered showing a sign of weakness. This doesn't hold true to everyone. There are some great dommes who focus on totally removing that idea altogether. You will still see it everywhere though. Dommes usually have to come across as icequeens who are never touched and get off. A popular exception is when a domme uses a sub as a sex toy. Otherwise? It can be pretty rare to see.

A way to cement this is how often you'll see it in popular depictions of lesbians. (Depictions made for male consumption. It holds true less often, but still holds true, in depictions and acts performed for and by lesbians.) A strapon is usually considered an item of power in lesbian BDSM porn, stories, and a lot of times with acts. Many lesbian dominatrixes dig the use of strap-ons. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, of course, but it does reflect a rather sexist notion.


**Male Entitlement and Devaluation:**

Specifically, male sub entitlement and devaluation. Male subs are treated like shit. There seems to be 30 of them for every dominatrix. They also slather on the praise and worship of any dominatrix that so much as shows up and get annoyed when they aren't given the treatment back. Think the same kind of entitlement most foreveralones or whatnot Reddit has. Then think of the same ways they're insulted and marginalized. Magnify it and you have yourself the general idea of what it seems to be like as a male submissive.

[\(This is talked about more in depth about in that previous link, which I'm posting against to make sure you read!\)](http://delvingintodeviance.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/the-devaluation-of-male-submission/)


**Racism and BDSM: **

Something poorly thought about and not often really studied. Race play is a part of BDSM, and racist imagery is used sometimes with pride. I've personally been told I should get a Nazi uniform to appeal to certain kinks, and once or twice as an insult. It's an interesting subject, but I honestly don't know a single person of color who is into BDSM well enough to give an experienced opinion. Google doesn't even provide much. The only thing I can say that I've noticed as particularly striking and interesting is black dominant women often times using race play in a very subversive fashion. There is also plenty of BBC imagery abound, but most of what I've seen seems to appeal to white men with a cuckolding fetish.


**Transsexuality in BDSM:**

This is quite simple. There are transsexual dominants and submissives. It tends to be that their gender status is used as a point of shame within BDSM. It is in fact how I got into BDSM. (And it fucked me up, though I suppose for some people it might be healthy.) Most people in BDSM tend to adapt and be pretty okay with transsexual people existing. Sadly, a lot of this boils down to the exoticness, and plays on certain sexual anatomy being either seen as a sense of strength or a weakness.

The big trans domination sites, which tend to exclude trans men in favor of “shemales” or “trannies” in reference only to trans women, tend to have a theme that it's embarrassing to have to suck a trans woman's cock. It's a pretty blatant continuation of the fetishism trans women have to experience throughout porn that can often be very invalidating.I feel it's more suited for a discussion on transphobia in general, as it isn't really all that different in the BDSM communities compared to outside it.


**Wrap up/tl;dr:**

Same shit that effects everyone outside the world follows us everywhere and the BDSM community isn't special in avoiding that, it just falls into it in different ways.

Hiding bigotry behind humor",The_Bravinator,54,11,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/puz5e/but_its_just_a_joke_hiding_bigotry_behind_humor/,"We see it EVERY FREAKING DAY on here. Someone says something vile and the ""it's just a joke, you can't get offended over *jokes*"" brigade rolls out.

But why not? Why is something protected from being offensive because it was said with humorous intent? The ideas behind it remain the same, after all. 

I'm sure a lot of people on Reddit were bullied, given the amount of people in general who have been and the way the site tends to attract nerds/self-confessed ""socially awkward penguin"" types. I think there have even been some AskReddit threads about it. A lot of bullying takes the form of jokes at the expense of the person being picked on. I feel like, given the numbers, there's a strong chance that people who have been hurt by jokes in the past are pulling out the ""stop being so sensitive"" line now.

I know I'm preaching to the choir here with the idea that jokes *can* be hurtful and *can* be bigoted just as any speech can, but I would like to build a discussion around it because I don't understand *why* people think that all jokes are (and should be treated as) 100% fine. I'm hoping that someone can help me understand this view.

There's also the kind of joking we do in SRS that mocks these views. Parroting the views of Redditors on things like seduction, race or their opinion of women in the over-the-top way we do *feels* just fine (and very funny) to me. We're clearly sending up the views themselves rather than them being views we actually hold. But a few times I've seen people make a joke that's a little too close to the bone, a little too believable, and I've anticipated them being called out for it. In those cases it's completely accidental on the part of the person doing it and they don't believe the things they're saying any more than the rest of us, but everyone seems to *feel* it when the line has been crossed. I've never been able to articulate exactly why it is that I feel that, though. Where is the line? When most people would find it difficult to tell apart from genuine Redditry? When there's a danger of it perpetuating the view instead of sending it up? 

And, of course, are people less likely to find a joke about a sensitive subject offensive if it's really really funny? Sometimes it seems so. But why does a talent for humor excuse espousing bigotry?

Humor and offense are really tricky in combination. While it tends to be more of a ""gut feeling"" thing for me, that generally puts me right in line with the rest of SRS.

What's the connection between pain in one's posterior and whinging on the internet? 

I realize urbandictionary isn't exactly the last word on etymology, but I think it does give a pretty good overview of how different people understand the meaning of a particular slang term.

[Example 1:](http://butthurt.urbanup.com/5560456)

&gt;Butthurt is that special feeling in your ass after it's been kicked and/**or fucked.**

...

&gt;Today, butthurt occurs most commonly when you fall asleep with your friends and they, being your friends, **decide it would be funny to sodomize you.**

[Example 2:](http://butthurt.urbanup.com/4211795)

&gt;A special feeling in the lower backside after it has been kicked **or fucked.** It is usually characterized by noisy whining and complaining after being owned.

[Example 3:](http://butthurt.urbanup.com/3200426)

&gt;Whenever someone gets so hurt by something that it cannot be defined as a regular persons pain but **similar to a gay guys hurt the first time intercourse is made!**

&gt; The burning sensation in the anus after homosexual intercourse

[Example 5:](http://butthurt.urbanup.com/26002)
&gt;What you are after the Tossed Salad Man is finished with you. See toss salad.

&gt;*My butt hurt because I just had my salad tossed and the faggot used teeth.*

&gt;To whine, bitch, or complain like a woman.

Am I reading too much into this?,WitchJustice,49,8,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/198o0n/possible_tw_for_eating_disordersan_eating/,"Hey everyone,

So I go to a major public university and when I went to the bathroom (women's bathroom) this morning, I was in for a surprise. All of the mirrors were covered up with green paper. A sign declared that today was ""Mirrorless Monday"" and that it was an awareness campaign for eating disorders. The note encouraged us to reflect on our outer beauty and to not fuss over our physical appearances. And emphasized how often we look into the mirror in order to criticize our bodies/appearance. Other women's writings were scrawled across the paper saying things like ""You're sexy and you know it"". 

I am all for the obvious messages here. Of course we should appreciate our inner beauty. But something about it was bothering me and I think I finally figured out why.

First off, the men's bathrooms did not have covered mirrors. This was probably because all of the organizers were women and couldn't get access to the men's room. But it carried some possible implications that I didn't like. 

It seemed to me like this was... well, kinda sexist. The assumption seems to be that women use the mirror for non-functional or self-reducing reasons. Which isn't cool. I check the bathroom mirrors before class to make sure I don't have eyelashes stuck in my eyes (my eyelashes curl downwards and I don't want to be trying to deal with it in class). That's a functional reason. I also like to have mirrors around so I can appreciate my new haircut and how freaking awesome it looks. I'm not the only one: when the paper was taken down about an hour ago, the woman next to me said ""Yay! Now we can see how pretty we look!"" While I recognize that a lot of women do use mirrors in an unhealthy way, it seemed to me that this was a pretty sexist stereotype.

And even if women do use mirrors to criticize their own appearance, I don't this was a positive way of dealing with it. The response should be ""Why are women doing this?"" not ""Let's stop them!"" Which deals with women's behavior and not a long-term solution. It carried this implication that we can dictate to women how they treat their own bodies. And that makes me super uncomfortable-especially when unnamed strangers are trying to tell me what I shouldn't do with my own behavior. 

I don't think there was any malice, it just seemed to be a misguided campaign. Or am I really stretching it and incorrectly making this into be something sexist or problematic? If you agree with me, what would be an effective alternative campaign?

I'm a gay guy, and I don't know who else to go to.

But I figured, you're the kind of people to talk to for this sort of thing.

I was hanging out at my friends house, who is also gay. And when we were watching a movie he started touching me inappropriately. Such as rubbing my leg, trying to give me a massage, cuddling against me when he clearly had a boner. I had no interest of doing anything with him. But he kept at it, when I told him to stop he would just start up again later.

For some reason, after 4 hours of this...I gave in, and when he reached down my pants to give me a hand job, I didn't stop him.

I felt awful, I thought he would stop but he started up again. This time worse than ever, he forcefully tried to stick his hand down my pants multiple times, pinned me down, asked why I didn't want to do it again and that he's ""never met a guy who turned this down"". This continued for about an hour.

When I left I cried, I don't even know what to feel.

I don't even think this is rape...I mean letting a guy give you a hand job doesn't seem like it would qualify for that...

My friends thought I was being oversensitive, and that I clearly enjoyed it. I mean I physically enjoyed it, but mentally I wanted him to stop.

Maybe I am just being oversensitive, I could have stopped him...

In my view, what it comes down to is that we're not in the business of drawing lines in the sand of diction. They exist, yes. There are many incontrovertible lines that *should simply not be crossed*. We all essentially agree on those lines.

I worry, though, that the folks inquiring about their vocabulary are more of the mentality of ""Can I use this word to insult this person"" rather than attempting to improve their own mindset in the pursuit of being better people.

I worry about this because I've actively been trying to cull ableist terms out of my vocabulary, not because I'm simply trying to make my means of expression more palatable to others but because I'm actively empathizing more and more with a group I've had very limited exposure to. 

I really hope others are doing the same, but the more times I see posts asking about vocabulary it's much more ""what synonyms are okay to use in lieu of this problematic term"" rather than a willingness to change mentalities.

To get specifically personal: I've become better friends with people who not only stopped using the word ""gay"" as a pejorative because it was ""offensive"" or ""uncouth,"" but took the next step and used that linguistic change as a cause for introspection.

In short, I'd urge people about to make a post asking whether some pejorative is okay to use to instead consider why that word denigrates a class of people and what that says about internalized preconceived notions.

My opinions here probably reflect my geography as much as they do my privilege; I live in the UK unlike most of you, and I live in a city where it is not necessary to run a car. Our population density is high and supermarkets frequently open up gladly making a loss just to prevent competitors from buying up the land.

Why do poor people eat terrible food? I ask to understand and think about how we might deal with the problem, not to shame or embarrass. 

Is it cheaper? I don't know how much macdonalds costs in the US, here a meal in macdonalds costs maybe £4-5 for a meal? For a family, that's lots of money. Is fresh food more expensive in the US? I'm vegetarian (yeah yeah) and two servings worth of korma or pasta sauce from a jar with pasta or rice is easily £3 including fresh veg. It does not take more than 15 minutes to prepare. The nicest things I can cook cost the same as the crappest fast food you can buy. 

Is it convenience/access? There are plenty of late night and indian takeaways near me, but the nearest 'fast food' joint is a subway 10 minutes away, the nearest not-pretending-to-be-healthy one is a McD's and a KFC 30 minutes walk away. The nearest supermarket is opposite the subway and there's another in town 30 minutes away. They're everywhere. People in poor parts of the US; how far is your nearest supermarket? Are you stuck with only 'mini-markets' (we call them corner shops here usually) or do you not even have those?

Is it an education thing? I know congress thinks pizza is a vegetable, but do people? Do you get taught about healthy eating in school? Do you get taught how to cook in school?

Keep in mind that I'm a man, so it would probably be worse for the other half of the population.

Even when I was technically obese, I was theoretically healthy (good blood work, blood pressure, etc) although I was very unhappy with my body.

Anyway, I started controlling what I eat and lifting weights and I lost weight and gained muscle pretty fast.  To be honest it makes me kind of sad that I didn't do it earlier, because although of course the time in the gym and the strict diet weren't easy, they really weren't that hard either.

My original motivation was the end of a relationship and the desire for the next relationship to be with a more attractive (by conventional standards) woman.  It seems a little shitty and somewhat objectifying of women, as well as a significant (3-5 hours a week and a larger food budget) time investment in something basically related to vanity.

I realize that objectifying women (or men) is shitty, and am not sure how to reconcile the fact that I know that I should not objectify women with being more attracted to a conventionally-attractive body type.  Am I just being a shitlord?

On top of that I feel that the nice body I have now is basically a physical embodiment of my privilege, I eat healthy food, which costs me about $5 a day more than what I used to eat and pay a bit more than a dollar a day for gym membership, plus time for the gym and cooking (I spend about 30 min a day cooking/cleaning up after cooking).

On top of that, my job is to turn potatoes into incredibly unhealthy processed foods that are a major driver of obesity, especially in the poor... which I am not anymore. (I am an engineer in a plant that makes french fries and potato chips plus tater tots, etc), all of which are pretty much the last things I would consider eating.

EDIT: My cost per day for a nice body is around $7 + 30 min/day average - I still had to cook and eat something before after all.  So 15 minutes and 45 minutes of minimum wage (I make quadruple minimum wage (salary compared to 40 hour weeks of minimum wage), but typically 60-70 hour weeks at my job).

1366405096.0,40,self.SRSDiscussion,1cp6nr,Can we please have a discussion about shaming people (usually women) for not being okay with porn.,braveliltoaster11,64,24,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1cp6nr/can_we_please_have_a_discussion_about_shaming/,"**Potential TW!**

Okay, now I get that all of you have a different opinion on porn. What I want to know is why it is okay to shame women who want to be in a relationship with their partner not watching porn. It really upsets me, that after having read multiple threads on places like /r/sex, /r/relationships, and /r/askreddit, that consistently every single time a woman says she doesn't want her partner to watch porn while they are in a relationship (especially when she makes this clear at the beginning of the relationship), that she is shamed for being a prude, being [](/tw ""crazy""), being immature, having low self-esteem, being controlling/[](/tw ""a bitch""), and basically called worthless. In fact, the only way for a woman to say she dislikes porn is to say that she *used to* dislike porn but has since seen the light and is now okay with it, and that other women who haven't are just insecure. I can post specific links if anyone is interested, but they are very easy to find.

For me personally, the majority of porn makes me upset for many different reasons. It makes me feel physically ill and feel violated. It makes me feel like my relationship with my partner is not as valuable if my partner is watching real other people get off instead of using their imagination or reading fiction etc. It feels like cheating to me, especially because I have been with partners who consistently watched porn instead of having sex with me when I made it extremely clear that I wanted to have sex. It makes me feel shamed for having a different body type, or wanting to have sex in a different way. I also hate the majority of porn for straight cis white men that is very much about humiliating and dominating women, is often very racist, and not at all focused on pleasing the woman. 

And my other huge concern is that in most cases there is no way to know that the people in the porn movie are all there completely of their own free will (any people appearing in porn, not just women). We know for a fact that some people have been raped in porn or pressured into doing it and the porn is sold/posted anyway. And we know for a fact that some amateur porn is posted without all participants' consent or knowledge. So at what percentage is it okay? If 1 out of 10,000 videos you watch, you are watching someone being raped or watching a video posted without consent? 1 out of 1000? 1 out of 100? It just makes me sick thinking of this.

Now, given all that, I feel like I have my own personal very *real* and *legitimate* reasons to not be okay with this in my relationship. However, the general consensus is always that *I* have to change, that *I* am somehow wrong and that *all of my feelings are invalid*. It just seems like a huge wave of misogyny, and that my feelings aren't valid because I'm a woman. Basically that I just need to ""grow up"" and deal with the fact that all guys watch porn and I am a freak. I don't think it is fair that just because porn is extremely common that I am automatically in the wrong for having issues with it. So I was hoping I could start a discussion on here about the topic, with hopefully some more balanced and diverse viewpoints and get other people's input on the issue.

**Edit:** First, I want to thank everyone that has been participating in the discussion so far. You're all awesome! 

Secondly, I guess I worded this post in a strange way that wasn't very clear, so to clear it up, what I was trying to start a discussion on was why shaming women for disliking porn is so prevalent. I gave my feelings as an example to show that women that dislike porn aren't doing it just for no reason. However, some people took this as an argument saying I wanted to discuss whether porn was okay, which was not where I was trying to aim this discussion. It is my fault for not being more clear because I got a little rambly and unfocused in the original post.

So basically, *whether or not* you like or agree with porn, why do you think there is a culture that shames people (usually women) who dislike porn, in a relationship or not? And what, if anything can be done about it (not to make everyone stop watching porn, but to make it okay to personally not watch porn, or to tell a person at the start of a relationship that it's important you)?

Hi SRS, I don't know if this is the proper way of requesting your intervention, please forgive me if I'm over assuming, but I have seen you folks effect change on Reddit on occasion, when you focus on a specific matter of concern to you.

I know that the main focus of this community is the feminist cause, but I also know that you oppose other forms of bigotry. This thread is proof, as are so many others which condemn Redditors' racist behaviour.

I also admit that my motivation in making this post is somewhat egoistical, or just biased, as I am a person of mixed ethnicities - one of which is black African.

Nevertheless, may I request that you target this particular subreddit - r/[slur against black ppl], and get it removed, just like you did with r/jailbait and r/creepshots?

I know that technically you can't remove subreddits, only the admis of Reddit can, but it's undeniable that you played a major part into such results, manifesting your constant opposition towards the existence of these sections, in Reddit and outside.

So, what I ask is: could you please do the same against this subreddit?

Also, please forgive me if my English seems clumsy, it's not my native language.

If you want to meet the worst people in the world, I recommend enrolling in computer science. For context, I'm in germany.

Now besides the hilarious lowest common denominator internet and nerd references such as 42, having lost the game, trollface being everywhere I have so far not spoken to one person who hasn't turned out to be a shitlord.

Right off the bat, during the tutorial week where they showed us the university and the IT-Campus, our tutorial guy (who was a third semester student) complained to our all-male group of 20 people or so that we have a room that serves as a special women's cafe, and that the people who made it happen don't seem to understand how all positive discrimination is inevitably also negative discrimination (uuuuuggggghhhhhh). Yes it is preposterous to think that maybe at a course that's probably around 90% male how any other cafe could possibly default to a men's cafe. 

Now there is a room where people of all genders can chill and da menz won't be discriminated against, and my eye was immediately caught by a picture of pedobear that someone pinned to the wall. Of course I was not the only one to notice this from my tutorial group, and people took the chance that they also knew internet references and had no issue whatsoever with jokes about pedophilia. Later I also saw a guy who literally had a ""pedobear seal of approval"" sticker on his laptop. To think that this person must have ordered this sticker, waited for it to arrive, and then placed it on the lid of his laptop and in all that time not realized ""hey, wait, maybe I shouldn't be a total fucking shithead and decorate my laptop with pedo endorsements""

At one point one fellow student I saw potential in complained to me about one of his practice group tutors, who happened to have bad enough eyesight to be legally disabled. Apparently the guy was kind of rude, and my fellow student was quick to point out that he was probably compensating for his disability. WTF? 

At one point I walked in on a conversation between another fellow student and a woman who then told us that she though the women's cafe was stupid because she wouldn't want to spend time with other women anyway, as women are boring. ok.

At one point I was watching a presentation and the guy was trying to go to the redhat linux website, but muscle memory prompted him to type ""reddi"" into the url bar before correcting his mistake. The whole room started laughing and I thought to myself ""I fucking knew it! They're all redditors!""

This is in part a vent, just because I find the situation quite frustrating, but I'm also sure I can't be the only one in this situation on SRS. What do you do to cope? I thought maybe I should get some tshirts that kind of express the fact that I'm not a shitlord, so that other non-shitlords may recognize me. I'm not sure what though, the brd would be a good canidate but that would narrow my target audience quite a lot. Feminism really needs more mascots.

I only know about James Deen because apparently his shtick is that he looks like James Dean and his reputation extends beyond his films, but I've never actually seen him perform.

Still, his AMA popped up on my front page so I browsed it. Most of his answers didn't surprise or even bother me, and I like his pro-communication, pro-enthusiastic consent, and ""your kink is not my kink and that's okay"" attitude (or what I've seen of it, granted I have not read every single thread).

[But this comment, where he quite strongly opposes mandating condom usage in porn, didn't sit well with me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12p9tj/i_am_james_deen_ask_me_anything_regarding_measure/c6x0gf5)

At the risk of leading the discussion... I know that many people don't enjoy seeing condoms in porn, but as a safety and public health measure, I can't find myself taking a stance against condoms. Porn actors of all genders are tested regularly, yes, but some STDs can test negative (including HIV) and there's always that window between exams that exposes actors to danger. Not to mention that making condoms a regular part of porn would go miles in encouraging safe sex practices, which is a net good for public health.

Am I alone? On one hand, your body, your choice, and this includes safe sex measures (although your partner does have a say in whether they will consent to your safety measures or lack thereof). On the other, the health risks to porn actors could be minimized by mandating condom use, and it could promote condom usage among the general population who watch porn, and to me, that benefit is substantial.

What are your stances, SRSters who do or don't watch porn that involves penises? Relatedly, if condoms were mandatory, should dental dams and the like be made mandatory for oral stimulation?",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_12q9ko,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/12q9ko/james_deen_ama_mandated_condom_use_in_porn/,

I'm fairly new to posting on reddit (though I have been reading and lurking for quite some time), so I apologize if I mess up in this post somehow. I did do a search for this but did not find anything in here.

On Tumblr there is a contingent of what seems to be mostly young white females and the occasional white male who call themselves ""otherkin"". They seem to believe that just as transsexual people are born into a body of the wrong sex, they are born into a body of the wrong species. Not only that, but they can be fictional or mythological species, or even have ""headmates"" (mental companions) that are characters from fiction. This idea sounds completely laughable, I know, and at first I thought it had to be some kind of elaborate inside joke, but there were so many blogs that kept up the seriousness so much of the time that I did some Googling and for all the world, it appears that this is a serious belief that some people have.

Now honestly it seems to me that this is a pretty frightening escapist break from reality on the part of some very sheltered kids with way too much Internet access and not enough fresh air. Furthermore, a lot of these kids are involved in SJA in other ways, which community they have badgered into some degree of ""tolerance"" for them, so now they have an Internet circlejerk of their very own calling them special and catering to their weird fantasies. They are honestly trying to claim things like that it's erasing to say ""you are not a fictional troll and you don't have Sherlock Holmes living in your head with you"". Finally, because they are all or mostly white, I can't help but think this is a way to play out the ""exotic oppressed minority"" fantasy that so many whites seem to have without getting called out on it.

Am I completely off-base here? Are these kids delusional, and if so, why aren't more people doing something to stand up to them?

I guess my biggest issue is the giant women’s movement that physical self-improvement is “empowering” or “feminist.” I’ve seen and commented on several women on reddit who say things like “I’m getting breast augmentation for MEEE” and are celebrated for it. I feel like this is in direct opposition to feminism. I hear “I am getting bigger boobs because I’m tired of being ridiculed for them being too small. I’m giving up on fighting against the enforced ideal of beauty so I’m just going to conform.” I get that that really is doing something for yourself, but I also feel like that confirms the unrealistic ideal of beauty and is in direct opposition to feminism. Breasts are just lumps of tissue on your chest that are there to feed a baby. If they are tiny, they are tiny. If they are giant, then they are giant. So be it. 

I’ve also heard the argument that as long as the woman buys into the unrealistic standard of beauty, *even if she understands that it is unrealistic,* then getting a breast augmentation is still acceptable to feminists. I understand that it’s not my place to tell anyone what to do with their own body. I just feel that that sort of logic enforces the unrealistic standards even further. What if I, personally, do not like my breasts and want to have them removed entirely? Let’s assume that that is my personal interpretation of beauty. It certainly goes against the socially agreed upon standard, and in that case, I would be doing it for myself. 

But that would be weird, right? *Everyone* wants giant boobs, right?

Okay, I guess what I’m trying to say is this: I’m struggling with the issue of whether or not the whole “I’m going to conform because I’m tired of dealing with not conforming” is giving up on feminism. Or: “is feminism a good excuse for conforming to unrealistic ideals of beauty?”

These incidents range from people disregarding my sexuality, singling out my sexuality, making comments about sharing a bed with me in hotels, to not counting me as an actual woman. I'm sure there are others, some of them I just ignore as dumb insignificant comments, or perhaps accidental. One even took me about 15 minutes to figure out what was meant. 

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression) (I know, reputable source, lol): 
&gt;The term was first coined by American psychiatrist Chester M. Pierce[1] and described as, ""brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults toward people of other races.""

Obviously the definition has been expanded to include things like disability, sexuality, gender, age, religion, etc etc. Do you guys see microaggression as a common problem? Do you agree with the definition above or do you think microaggression should be more limited to small remarks that the speaker may not have intended to be racist/homophobic/sexist/etc? Most of the incidents I referenced above have been from people who I don't believe are homophobic, are probably didn't intend to be hurtful. I still consider them microaggression; when I was told ""you should still gives guys a chance and date one"" I didn't consider that microaggression but rather full blown homophobia.

Instead, I'd like to discuss the title: is it classist to suggest that all people should follow a vegan diet?

My thoughts are that a lot of people whom are impoverished and live in food-poor areas simply don't have the means to be strict vegans.

&gt;Though the amount of times it is right is neglectable in the bigger picture. [*Referring to when it is right for people to eat meat.*]

Rules:

* No personal attacks, harassment, or flaming; keep discussion constructive and focused on the topic at hand

* Serious posts only; if you want to circlejerk, SRS is still here

* SRSD is a progressive, feminist, anti-racist, LGBTQ-positive subreddit; you do not necessarily need to identify as all of these, but if you are actively opposed to any of these you will be asked to leave

* SRSD is a space for progressives to discuss issues among themselves; if you come from a different perspective, you are welcome to critique and ask questions, but your behavior should be that of a guest in a progressive space

* Similarly, if you have a difference of opinion with the SRS userbase, you should come to SRSD willing to learn; if you demonstrate that you are not open to changing your mind, you will be asked to leave

* Assume that everyone else is arguing in good faith; if you have reason to believe they aren’t, message the moderators rather than calling them out

* Unsubstantiated claims will be deleted; if you assert something, provide either empirical evidence or logical support for it, whichever is appropriate

* Avoid problematic language whenever possible (gendered language like “bitch” or “hysterical”, slurs, stereotyping, etc)

* SRSD is a place for those who are willing to learn, promote discourse, and discuss in good faith, if a moderator has reason to believe that you are not all three of these, we will come to your house, hold you down, and fart in your mouth twice. Or ban you.

Submissions:

* Your title should be either a question or a proposition; topics can include gender, race, sexuality, politics, economics, ethics, philosophy, culture, etc.

* No submissions about Reddit stuff, keep that to /r/theoryofreddit, but if a particular Reddit thread is relevant to your topic, it’s fine to include it.

* **Self posts only**; in the post, consider including links to relevant background information, a summary of the issue, and potential arguments for different sides.

* If you wish to include your personal opinion, it should be clearly indicated as such, and put at the end of the post.

* If multiple commenters challenge your wording or framing of the title, or the neutrality of your OP, edit your post to reflect that.

* If your post was inspired by a particular SRS thread or comment, be sure to include a link to it in your OP, and feel free to x-post your submission to the original.

I get that Prime isn't a place for serious discussion, but in this case Rule X is apparently only being applied in one direction.

I'm constantly seeing arguments about how unprivileged soldiers are, how they need money for college, for their children and etc.  That's certainly a mitigating factor, but can we please stop pretending that that makes it okay?  In our discussions of privilege within our society, we're completely ignoring the *massive* first world privilege that even the poorest American enjoys.  What greater privilege could there be than having the option to join up on the invaders' side of the conflict, rather than being forced to live on the other side? 

Basically, as a poor American you have two choices.

1. Live in the first world's version of poverty, depend on public assistance and charity, and do your best to scrape out a living, or...
2. Join the military, face very little risk to your own life thanks to the massive technological and economic advantages our military enjoys, and improve your own life by ending those of people in the third world.

As an Afghani, on the other hand, your choices are...

1. Live in a kind of poverty that would make the poorest Americans welch, or...
2. There is no option 2.  You're stuck in the country that the Americans and other first world nations trashed, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about the fact that foreigners who don't speak your language or know your culture will be roaming your neighborhood with automatic weapons, and if you piss them off or even if they just misunderstand something they will kill you and/or your family.  And if you dare to stand up and fight back against them, they will almost certainly kill you.

Given the two vastly different sets of circumstances, it astonishes me to hear anyone, especially someone in such a ""progressive"" community as SRS, saying things like ""support the troops, not the war,"" as if elevating your own privilege at the cost of the lives of those less privileged than you can somehow be morally acceptable.

I'm not saying that soldiers are irredeemably bad people, or that we should be running them off or throwing them in jail.  I get that people make mistakes, and I accept that they can move past them.  What I will not accept, however, is trying to help people get over their mistakes by telling them that they didn't actually do anything wrong.

There's a post in SRS today where a redditor objected to someone gendering a hypothetical child molestor in a story as male, saying essentially ""hey, there are female child molestors too"". SRS's general reaction was to say that it was okay, because child molestors/rapists are predominantly male.

Of course, we're profoundly against these sort of statistical arguments in other cases, e.g. ""I'm nervous around black people because they're statistically more likely to commit crimes"". Same for arguments against immigrants, racial profiling by the TSA, etc. The problem for me is that I don't see why any of the arguments against the latter aren't valid against the former. Here's a couple that come to mind:

• ""The statistics are true, but not *because* of their race - there are broader systemic effects (often economic ones) causing it.""

• ""It's dehumanizing to reduce someone to a stiatistic. People are people, not numbers and averages.""

And so on. All these arguments seem like they would be just as applicable to what the redditor was speaking out against. Am I missing something? Why isn't this hypocrisy?

(There's more I have to add/write about this and more specific quotes, but I don't have the time or will to do it all on my phone right now)

The whole thing started when somebody linked me https://studentsuccess.org/flash/army.swf and told me to go to Video 2, time 3:50. I'm going to transcribe the dialogue here and then get to my question:

&gt;Person 1: Each person has the absolute right to stop at any time.
&gt;
&gt;Person 2: Hold on. So you're saying that if I'm getting it on with a girl and she's not into it, I'm a rapist?
&gt;
&gt;Person 1: Yes.
&gt;
&gt;Person 2: Even if I don't know that she's not consenting?
&gt;
&gt;Person 3: Yes.
&gt;
&gt;Person 2: Even if we're in the middle of it, and then she changes her mind?
&gt;
&gt;Persons 1 and 3: Yes.
&gt;
&gt;Person 2: Well then doesn't she have to tell me she's not into it?
&gt;
&gt;Person 3: Well, she should. But it's never the victim's responsibility to stop rape. Whether she says no or not, if she's not consenting, you're committing sexual assault.
&gt;
&gt;Person 1: Yeah, the problem is too many guys assume 'yes,' unless they hear 'no.' But that's backwards.
&gt;
&gt;Person 3: To make sure you don't commit sexual assault, you have to assume 'no,' unless you hear 'yes.'
&gt;
&gt;Person 1: But how am I supposed to know? It's not like it's always clear.
&gt;
&gt;Person 3: We're going to talk about some factors in our culture that can make consent unclear. But you've got to remember that you are legally responsible to make sure you have clear consent, or you've got to stop. Remember, unless she consents, it's sexual assault. 
&gt;
&gt;Person 1: And while it's never the victim's responsibility, it's smart to clearly and repeatedly communicate non-consent if something's happening that you don't want to happen.

I'm conflicted about one thing. While I absolutely, vehemently, 100% agree that ""it's never the victim's responsibility to stop rape. Whether she says no or not, if she's not consenting, you're committing sexual assault"" and that ""too many guys assume 'yes,' unless they hear 'no,'"" I'm confused about the application of that logic while in the act of sex. 

It seems to me that once clear and enthusiastic consent has been given and sex has started, it is a *reasonable assumption* that consent is continuing throughout the act. Now, as soon as anything is said that so much as implies a lack of consent, sex should stop. Immediately. 

My conflicted feelings come from the inference that a person should be capable of ""reading"" non-consent from his partner. It seems unrealistic and unfair. But on the other hand, a woman might well be uncomfortable and/or scared of saying ""stop"" while in the act of sex, and it's wholly unreasonable to blame *her* for being frightened. But on the *other* other hand, is it her partner's fault for not realizing that she has withdrawn consent if she hasn't made any move to express that? In most cases I think there would be obvious body language, but is that necessarily always the case?

This concerns me, not because I'm afraid of teh wimminz deciding I'm raping her and getting the police to arrest me and child support and spermjacking and alimony and whatever, but because the idea of accidentally raping a partner is horrifying and because I'm experiencing a fair amount of cognitive dissonance on this topic.

This is my first SRSD post, so I'm not sure if I've done anything wrong. I've looked at the rules and I don't think it violates any of them, but please let me know if something needs changing and I'll fix it ASAP.

1343716047.0,37,self.SRSDiscussion,xfqzh,Why I don't care about your privileged self-pity.  ,,56,19,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/xfqzh/why_i_dont_care_about_your_privileged_selfpity/,"TWs: Violence, sexual violence, suicide. 

So I've been thinking of the culture of self pity. Well it's been kinda forced on me. So really, I'm pissed. And I deal with anger with snark. I'm sure this will bring on some tone arguments. You are able to stay calm while discussing violence and oppression, cool. I bet it's easy when it's not your violence or your oppression. 

So recently I've lost a few IRL friends over this Chick-Fil-A thing. Well it's not really about Chick-Fil-A, it's much bigger than that. It's a fight that's been raging for the last few hundred years. This is just another small chapter. It's tiny. 

Over the last few weeks I've been in a whirlstorm of a lot of people around me (IRL) defending that chicken joint. I'm sure you've all seen the arguments that come out of this, and you know why they are BS. But basically, I have had people all around me trip over each other to defend somebody's right to oppress GSM Americans, including myself.

Now I'm sure some of you are ready to attack me for being American-centric. Look, I'm super proud of Canada for having a long standing history of gay marriage (less than a decade, it was legalized in 2005) and if you are not Canadian, I'm sure your country has no history of anti-GSM rhetoric fueled/caused by religion. Yes, anti-GSM violence and sentiment only exists in America. It's not like there's gangs of Christians going out to murder homosexuals in Africa right now, because some white American pastor told them about the horrible sin of homosexuality and that's all they needed to hear to start killing. Eastern European countries don't have a notable religious population, and even if they did they don't have any history of anti-gay violence. It's not like Moscow police break up gay pride parades because it was deemed ""Satanic."" Latin America is just a wonderland for openly GSM people. Not a single religious demonstration against GSM folk to be thought of. Religious hatred for queers begins and ends at USA's borders, and since you don't live here you have no reason to care. 

First off, the gay marriage debate is beyond GSM people getting married. It's not just about getting married. Many people (regardless of sexuality and/or gender) don't want to get married or have a family. It's about the possiblity of getting married. It's about being recognized as an actual human deserving of rights and dignity and not as  (as The Bible would say) an abomination. It's religious and legal warfare from a society doesn't value us. That's why you always about the ""sanctity"" of marriage. It needs to be kept ""sacred"" by keeping GSM people out. 

So then comes Chick-Fil-A. A guy says that since he has Christian values, it's his right to hate gay people. And since he's Christian, he's going to give over 2 million dollars to other Christian groups. Christian groups that just happen to exist solely to prevent gay rights. Oh sorry, not hate people, disagree with homosexuality. And according to a lot of people, disagreeing with homosexuality isn't bigotry. It's just his view, and it's ""just as bad"" for me to call him out for it. Now if this was just one guy saying it, I wouldn't be so pissed. But the fact is, people all around him are tripping over each other rushing to defend this Christian bigot. ""Oh I'm not letting these PC queers stopping me from getting my chicken!"" ""It's his right to say those things! Freedom of speech!"" But almost worse than the hatred is that these bigots expect a pity party for them. I had somebody who I personally considered a friend complain about how he wonders if he'll ever be able to believe that marriage is only for a woman and a man without being called homophobic. He went on to post links about ""homosexual culture and agenda"" and the threat we pose to society. And of course, his Christian friends all said how insightful the article was. How this PC acceptance of homosexuality has gone ""too far."" How it's not fair that they are labeled bigots because it's their right to say what they think. That gay people were being ""heterophobic."" Talking heads lamented about how you can't even have an opinon today without being called homophobic, and oh how the masses swooned about how brave they were. Conservatives mocked gays for ""being surprised"" that he's anti-gay, because after all it's a Christian company and of course he's going to hold those views. I would have loved for it to be a surprise. It wasn't. You know it wasn't. I know that some of you are ready to shout out that not all Christians share that specific or other harmful beliefs. Technically, you are right. But you know in your heart that there's enough of a correlation that it's worth talking about. If there wasn't you wouldn't have to pull out your token examples. If you are less interested in the oppression that caused this anger and more offended by the anger, I really can't care less about your feelings. I'm actually really happy that this bugs you. This is my only outlet. When this  conversation comes up IRL, I say nothing. I can't. I don't say anything, honestly out of fear. Where I live, I can't even be out IRL. It's better for me to be dishonest with everyone I meet rather than face the mockery and threats of violence that I dealt with elsewhere. I'd love to be able to wear women's clothing all the time, but I can't because I'd be risking death or at best extreme ridicule if I stepped out the door. When Christians bullied me just right before suicide. Where because of that depression I was put into a mental hospital. Where I was put into a government ordered placement for troubled youth. Oh yeah, that placement? A Mormon run institution where the people who were paid to bring me out of my depression constantly made violent gay jokes. That preached about how homosexuality is a choice and to be one you are just acting out on your depression. That your depression can be cured by just not being gay. That to graduate from the program you needed to renounce atheism and homosexuality to find God. You want to know the funny part? My story isn't rare. If I asked you the name of that one GSM youth who was bullyed to the point of suicide by Christians, you would need me to be more specific. You might think of that one guy who was bullied to death, who had his name put on a bill that specified that Christians can bully GSM youths as long as their religion says so. No really, it said that as long as it's your religious belief, there's no recourse to being a bully. But hey, why even mention his name? The real issue here is your comfort. Hell, me even bringing him up and his suicide offends you! After all, you've never been homophobic in your life so why should you care? Nevermind the suicides, most importantly, you are offended.
 
Whenever I bring this up, there's always a chorus of privileged self pity. ""Oh, you are just as bad as they are! Stop being so mean! There's no difference between you and homophobes!""
Look Christians, you have no idea how privileged you are. Like every other majority group, society can't do enough to pander to you. You're blissfully unaware of how much society has made you the norm. You'll never not be represented. You'll never be marginalized. You mention your religion and you are automatically trusted by most people. You'll never be fired because of your religion/lack of religion. Remember when people were outraged because Obama might have been a Muslim? Remember how the War on Terror was started because God told Bush to? Remember when government funds went to religious schools, and the support for that suddenly dropped when they found out that it went to (GASP!) ISLAMIC schools? Do you think that shit would have flown if you didn't dominate the power structure? The worst oppression you'll ever face being reminded of my own oppression. You are so used to having everything being made to pander to you, the slightest infraction makes you think you know just what it's like to be the other. If being reminded of what your religion means to a lot of people bugs you, you might want to go to a more Christian positive space. May I suggest ""almost anywhere else?"" Because if you've never been to almost anywhere else, it's really pro-Christian. You'll find that in almost anywhere else, you dominate the power structure. I know it must be hard to only have almost anywhere else to run to, but you'll manage. 

Oh sorry, I forgot about all of that oppression you face.

Christian bars get shut down and run out of town because of concerned GSM groups.

Every politician with a serious campaign for president this year is queer, and all but one (Obama) has made a point to pander to his/her base by condemming Christianity. And since the beginning of time, it's dangerous for president to do anything short of condemning Christians because it endangers the GSM vote. 

If any Christian appears on a TV show, there's a GSM campaign to take them off the air because they'll corrupt the youth just by existing. 

Christian public figures have to hide their Christianity for years, often coming out on their death bed. 

Christian rights groups get death threats from GSM folk, calling out for Divine (as in the drag queen) punishment for their transgression of being religious. 

When Christians get bullied at school, the response from the GSM school officials is to just not act so Christian all the time. 

I should say that if you are Christian and your response to this isn't defensive anger, I honestly have no problem with you. If you're able to read about the effects and history of your religion and you say ""I know, I'm sorry"" then I'm on your side. If you are aware of how society is made for  you, I'm on your side. But if your response is still defensive anger, I'm not going to coddle you, and I'm not sorry for my stance.

It's not just a Christian thing. Far from it. It's all of the ruling groups. It's the white people who honestly think cracker is comparable to *insert racial slur* in offense. It's white people who ignore why The Black Panthers were created and focus on their ""reverse racism."" It's white people who are outraged that they don't have a White Entertainment Television or White History Month. It's white people who see nothing wrong with just mentioning that Romney is an Anglo Saxon. It's the men who get offended at anti-rape campaigns for only focusing on men because women can be rapists too. It's men who call women ""misandrist"" for being on guard for rape instead of being outraged at the fact that there's enough rape in the world that women need to be on guard. It's men It's straight people who say heterophobic without any irony. It's straight people who think that ""that's so gay"" and related phrases aren't offensive because nobody attaches sexuality to the term anymore. It's cis queer people who say that trans people are too weird and just hinder their civil rights. It's cis people that say they ""have no problem"" with trans people as long as they don't hit on them because ew. It's able-bodied people complaining about disabled parking spaces or defending their right to say ""lame."" It's Americans who have no idea why other countries would hate us. It's Americans who want the attempted genocide of the Native Americans taken out of schools because it might make some kids unpatriotic. It's (mostly white) Americans who called Chris Rock a racist for his 4th of July tweet.  It's the Americans who hate Obama for ""apologizing"" to other countries instead of being a cowboy and pew pew pew. It's the upper class that calls any economic policy that doesn't benefit nobody but them socialism. It's the upper class' welfare queen fantasy. It's the upper class' idea that the poor have it made. It's not just the people who believe these things, but the people who think it's offensive to mention that they even exist. That it's just not nice to mention, because not everyone is like that, and most importantly ""I'M NOT LIKE THAT!""

And yes, I know that Richard Dawkins is a misogynist. Shelia Jeffries is a transphobe who learned her cissexist rhetoric from patriachal society. Spike Lee uses Jewish stereotypes in his movies. Sarah Palin uses veiled racist rhetoric to appeal to her base and refuses to apologize for, or even admit that there's any racist in the Tea Party. This rant is long enough, I don't need to go into Intersectionality 101. 

And most of all, it's anybody that thinks that being a somewhat decent human deserves some special praise. If you start getting defensive the second there's a bit of discomfort on your end, you are not the amazing progressive ally you think you are. For once, it's not about you or your comfort.

Indigenous women suffer the highest rates of sexual assault in the nation, and are the women most frequently forced into prostitution.

What does it mean to 'help men?'

Personally, as a feminist, I'm not out to 'help men' or 'help women,' as individuals.  I'm out to deconstruct the models in our society that construct a false gender binary which constrains men and women into rigid roles in society. The best way I can think of (and only obstacle) to this is to enable or society to truly value incarnations of 'the feminine' in society - including notably their expressions by men.

Everything I do towards this goal helps some men, because there are men out there who want to be taken seriously for having 'feminine preferences.' What this doesn't seem to do is help ALL MEN, or MEN exclusively. In order to 'help men' you have to have an idea of what a 'true man' is. I don't believe that such a categorization is ever useful. I don't think you can define 'all men' in a useful way, because there is nothing that 'all men' want, except the freedom to decide for themselves.

So **feminism helps every man** who struggles to learn what toxic gender roles do in society and **it helps every woman** to do the same.   Feminism can help any person who would shoulder its cross.

The biggest point remaining is that feminism doesn't *create* these problems in our society. It shines a light into dark corners. It doesn't create a behavior just to criticize it.  It criticizes behaviors that are already there.  Feminism illuminates the problems and gives us tools to fix them.   

I contrast this to the List of Grievances listed in the MR sidebar.  I would consider most of these(false rape accusation aside) to be symptomatic of larger societal problems.  Light happens to *already* fall on these problems, and yet their source is much deeper and darker. Yet I've never seen discussion about solving or even acknowledging any underlying issues.  Instead, its as if all these problems originate with feminism(something which I argue above is impossible.)

Most of all, I hope that some people on the fence, as well as everyone born of a mother, can see that helping women, and valuing women, is helping men value more things about themselves and allows *everyone* to explore a full range of human capacities instead of keeping some behavior exclusively for 'men' or 'women.'

To start off, like so many other terms/jokes/memes, Reddit stole ""white knight"" from it's big brother, 4Chan. And, like many phrases, (like ""friendzone"" for example) it has been perverted from its original meaning.

Originally, a white knight was a man who used fake and over the top niceness and condescending chivalry to try to get with women. Obviously, this is bad, douche-y behavior. 

Now, white knight is used to describe any man who says anything nice about any woman, ever. If a woman is being openly mocked and doxxed somewhere on the web (which happens far too often), and someone sticks up for her, they are automatically called a white knight.

White knight is also often used to describe any male feminist. It assumes that men only identify as feminist to get with women, and that no man can genuinely holds feminist beliefs.

So, the old definition of white knight meant almost the exact opposite of feminism, and now it is practically synonymous with feminism. 

So what happened? Obviously, many men and women are frustrated with old expectations of chivalry. Men are frustrated because they feel as though they are expected to be borderline super heroes, and they feel like they're expected to do everything for their women. Women are frustrated because they feel as though they are being treated like princesses or goddesses, and they just want to be treated like people.

But do people really feel as though it's *feminism* that's upholding this tired dynamic? That it's *feminism* that expects men to be knights in shining armor, and treat women like princesses?

Unfortunately, yes, they do. This misplaced anger and frustration has lead to the creation of such belief systems as ""the red pill."" They feel as though the old expectations of chivalry leave both men AND women unfulfilled and frustrated. They are right in this. However, they are wrong in assuming that feminism is to blame, and they are wrong in thinking that the only alternative to treating women like dainty princesses is treating them like chattel. 

So my last question is this; is there any way to reclaim the term white knight? Or has it's use by anti-feminists tainted it beyond salvagability?",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_1k3b7r,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1k3b7r/lets_talk_about_white_knights/,

Ok yeah but (a) This doesn't mean that there's no such thing as rape culture. Stop being obfuscatory. And (ii) we've known this since at least *From Margin to Center*. You don't have a ""gotcha"" point; you just haven't done your research.

My initial plan is to e-mail the gym's owner, who loves to *talk* about how gym members are the number one priority, but this manager in particular is someone he went to high school with and has worked there for several years. The ""bro culture"" there is absolutely outrageous, and I'm worried that I'll send him an e-mail telling him about what happened only to have him support the manager.

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ead0x/the_face_of_a_defeated_man/

In it is a picture of a father looking disappointed/sad/not happy, because his daughters were gifted thongs and are seemingly proud of it. Cue outrage in the comments about girls being sexually active, despite their father's overprotective worrying. It all boils down to the stereotype of fathers not wanting their daughters to be sexually active until the age of forever, while their sons can do whatever the hell they wish.

This is not a stereotype that ever made sense to me and I've only seen it portrayed in very awkward ways in sitcoms. It's pretty much the only type of father-daughter relationship that is acknowledged in the media, or is at least the most prominent one.

I think I'm dealing with a cultural difference here and this might be a stereotype that is more rampant in America (I'm from mainland western Europe), but please correct me if I'm wrong in this assumption (that's why I'm starting this discussion). My relationship with my father has never been one in which I was the supposed fragile daughter that needed aggresive protection from a father against boys, quite the opposite. I was always encouraged to stand up for myself (even if I often failed in doing so, the point is that he wanted me to be able to fend for myself) and I never expected him to be some overly masculine father suffering from toxic machismo.

Most of all, my parents don't give a hoot about what kind of underwear I wear. Seriously, I personally don't wear thongs, but my sister has for her own reason since she was in her early teens. It's not something that is *always* a sexual thing, or has a connection to 'sluttiness' for any reason. 

Reddit, however, seems to make that connection and only that connection. Hell, the joke hinges on that assumption. I'd like to hear from other people if this kind of thinking is tied to certain cultures (because it's certainly not a biological thing, despite the desperate attempts of evo-psychs in the comments) or whether I'm seeing this in the wrong light.

Men defer to women on sexism, white people defer to people of color on racism, etc. This seems to be especially true when it comes to sex work. Criticism of sex work or being anti-prostitution is quickly brought down when the person with the position is questioned about whether or not they themselves are a sex worker.

But does this stance, that only sex workers should critique sex work, erase the perspectives of those who refuse to or are unable to talk about it?

Reddit is a website. It is a very misogynistic, rape apologetic, racist, classist website. It's a website of leisure, with much discussion about entertainment, media consumption, and higher education. 

Reddit is largely inaccessible to poverty-stricken people, and it is extremely unfriendly to women. It isn't just Reddit, though. The internet is often inaccessible to poverty-stricken people, as are organizations designed to help them, which may be many miles away, which might be small and unknown.

Women who are trafficked, women who are under the control of pimps, women who battle with drug addictions and work on the streets are not going to have the same access to places to speak and get their voices out, like the internet or organizations. In discussions talking about sex work, they *can't* come in and give their opinions.

Then there are women who *will not* talk about their experiences. There are women who have walked the streets, who have gotten into the cars of strangers, who have been beaten and raped, who will *not* talk about their experiences. Who fall silent and turn away from these discussions, much in the same way that a soldier refuses to talk about their experiences in war.


If only sex workers can critique sex work, then do we ignore the experiences of those who cannot or will not talk about them? I wrote this elsewhere, (""she"" refers to a friend who has exited prostitution):

&gt; She will not speak for herself. She has been open about some things, but not many She will not make articles to speak out.

(TW: Violence, Transphobia)",RobotAndy,50,14,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/19vi6k/trans_professional_fighter_discloses_her_status/,"[Fascinating Update - Leading Sex Reassignment Physicians Weigh In](www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/3/8/4075434/leading-sex-reassignment-physicians-weigh-in-on-fallon-fox)

On Monday a female fighter named Fallon Fox disclosed that she is transgendered *after* knocking out her opponent via knee to the head in 39 seconds. She s the first trans* fighter on record to compete in sanctioned MMA fights. As an aside for those who don't know, a sanctioned fight means that the fight falls under the jurisdiction of a State Athletic (or Boxing) Commission. The Commission ensures that the unified rules of MMA are observed, they assign qualified referees, perform random drug testing and handle fighter weigh-ins as well as a myriad of other things revolving around fighter safety and fight regulations.

Fallon underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2006 along with the supplemental hormonal therapy and she had her first [fight in 2013 which she won via armbar in the 1st round.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O63KAKFPC7g)

As you would expect, the reaction in the fan community ranges from bottom feeding shitlord all the way to open-armed acceptance. However some people are concerned that Fallon's first two opponents may have walked into a proverbial lions den as they fought, unknowingly, someone who went through puberty and early adulthood as a man. As these people are fight fans and not medical professionals, there is some debate as to whether this fact makes no difference, some difference or all the difference in the world when fighting in a cage. The admin of a respected MMA message board posted the following:

*The ABC has very stringent standards for licensing transgendered fighters. They was a very detailed presentation at the 2012 convention in FL. I forget all the protocols, but there has to be stabilized testosterone at a female level for a full year or maybe it is two years, and a ton of other stuff.*

*Dr. Sherry Wulkan did the presentation, and it was super interesting.It may take a while to get everything in place, but I have every expectation that Fallon will get licensed in time.*

Here is the [Sports Illustrated story](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/mma/news/20130305/fallon-fox-transgender-mma/) and here is the [thread on a popular fight forum](http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=forum.posts&amp;forum=1&amp;thread=2142727&amp;page=1). So now the discussion. I am looking for opinions on the following issues: 

- Even if she was not *required* to disclose her trans* status in her first two fights do you think she should have? 
- If you were a highly trained female fighter do you feel it would make a difference if your opponent was biologically a man until early adulthood?
- Does she benefit from an unfair advantage? 
- If she is denied a license to fight in the future is it due to bigotry against trans* individuals or protecting female fighters from certain harm?

For the record, I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with men and women. I get my ass handed to me by women all the time and there's no shame in it.

I realized this morning that my habit of referring to my genitalia as my ""lady parts"" (in a casual setting, for example: ""Honey, I think my period's starting, my lady parts hurt) is probably inherently cissexist, since many ladies do not have the same genitalia as I do.

By way of background, I'm a fairly secular/lapsed Jew and I live in the same neighborhood as a large swath of this particular orthodox community.  I see them daily walking their sons to school; girls are not allowed to attend the same institutions.  I see their wives and daughters walking around often during the day midweek, because very few of them are allowed to have jobs.  I don't seek out stories of abuse or misogyny, they're forced upon me by their profligacy and their daily occurrence.


I don't want to suggest that other communities don't have similar problems.  I don't want to suggest that this is a ""Jewish"" thing or a ""religious"" thing.  I've noticed that SRS seems to find it problematic to represent these kinds of stories even as representative of an entire community.


*But it really feels like it is reflective of an entire community.*


It really feels like it's an entire community *based* upon the education and idealization of a male conception of rights.  An entire community that tolerates and encourages sexual and emotional abuse of women, that speaks of the 'rights' of tradition over the rights of individuals.


I'm not an anti-Semite.  I'm not a self-hating Jew, I don't think.  But I find these stories despicable, and it gets harder and harder to separate 'incident' from 'community' with each new publicized abuse.

One thing I find a little problematic however, that often goes by unnoticed or even encouraged, is how fellow SRSters uses the same kind of fat/body/appearance-shaming that we loathe coming from the userbase of Reddit at large.

First off, unless we know that this dude is a shitlord himself, using his picture to indirectly say ""Redditors look like this and are ugly"" is undeserved.

Secondly, even if he *is* a shitlord, what he looks like should be entirely unimportant. A shitlord is a shitlord, no matter if he's butt-ugly or handsome.

I don't understand how there can be a problem with someone disclosing their STD after knowing someone for three days and not having had any physical contact with them...Posting flyers around campus and clubs seems an exceptionally cruel response to this, almost so much that I hope sadly that it was a troll post. 

For a decent person (i.e. one who fully discloses to partners before initiating physical intimacy), an STD pretty much ruins your life in terms of sex/intimacy and I imagine the issue of respectful disclosure must be an extremely difficult leap of faith for them to make every time they meet someone new :\ 

I won't say much more but that this issue makes me personally sad because a good friend contracted herpes thru carelessness with hooking up with an ex post breakup and it thoroughly depresses me whenev i think of their situation.

By this I mean things like ""Pedophiles/ephebophiles were born that way, like gay people, they can't help who they are attracted to, it's natural, etc."" I'm not going to deny that pedophiles/ephebophiles are born that way. However, I'm not sure I am entirely comfortable with pedophilia being lumped in with homosexuality, because pedophilia is considered a mental disorder. I understand that homosexuality was too once considered a mental disorder. However, I feel like there is a fundamental difference in homosexuality and pedophilia in the sense that ""acts"" of homosexuality are performed by two consenting adults, and acts of pedophilia are not. 


Wikipedia states ""Pedophilia can be described as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual sexual orientation because it emerges prior or during puberty, and because it is stable over time. These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and pedophiles can sometimes be helped by mental health professionals to refrain from acting on their impulses.""


I know Wikipedia is not the end all, however I felt that it explained the relationship in a way that seems accurate. And it is a definition that I agree with. I understand that we shouldn't immediately judge someone because of their physical makeup and things they cannot help. However, I dislike that a lot of people have been comparing pedophilia to homosexuality in almost the sense that society should just accept it. But I don't think society should ""just accept"" any hurtful behavior or actions, including acts of pedophilia. I have a feeling that a lot of the people who are comparing homosexuality and pedophilia are just being sloppy in their argument, however I still don't think this is okay. Because ultimately someone who has consensual sex with someone of a similar age of the same gender is different from someone who has sexual relations with pre-pubescent children.

It just seems like a lazy argument to me that could be used for any situation. ""Well their DNA made them that way"". It doesn't mean we should excuse all hurtful behavior that results from genetics in society.

1331325636.0,42,self.SRSDiscussion,qpcyl,"On the Proper Usage of terms ""Racism"" and ""Racist""",Willrich354,58,16,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/qpcyl/on_the_proper_usage_of_terms_racism_and_racist/,"I want to discuss two words, racism and racist, which is oft misused and misunderstood words in discussions of oppression. This topic also has great importance for me being a man of African descent in America that we deal with these things correctly especially considering the delicate situations these terms often come into.

I’m start with the term racism because by understand racism properly we can better understand what counts and don’t count as “racist”. At its core racism is a SYSTEM of oppression that’s based on class divisions based on (pseudo) physical appearance or ethnic origin. I put an emphasis on system because many people tend to forget that racism isn’t an idea/ ideology in so much as its a social construct. We have to look at it in a similar way to capitalism. Capitalism has the state, the army, it’s ideology, media and language that props it up and prevents its abolishment. Racism also has these institutions that prop it up and protect the system and in the US they are very much entwined with capitalism’s tools (a result of racism modern birth out of the profit motive).

Along with the above point if we are going to deal with racism and destroy it, we must make sure we are using the right tools. People who see racism as an idea or ideology (there is a racist ideology but that’s different from the system itself) think in order to eradicate racism we have to simply not act racist towards others. This strategy is destined for failure simply because they aren’t actually dealing with the system. Even if we all stopped being racist (whatever that means, the line is nebulous at best) the courts’ laws, which are racists, still exist. The language of black vs white, nigger/a, and other slurs still exist. Being nice to one another does little to gain power for those of us who want to actually take down the system which create material and political disadvantage for people of color. Now let me qualify all of this paragraph by saying that it’s of the utmost necessity to deal with racist ideas in ourselves and those around us but I’m only saying that this work is only one piece of the puzzle.

The last thing I want to say on this topic is that racism, like capitalism, survive because it have the material power (guns, courts, soldiers, police, etc) to protect itself not because people agree with it, although in many ways this also serves as power.

Now that we have set the groundwork with dealing with the term racism, let’s deal with a derivative of it, “racist”. Racist is an adjective that describe someone or their actions, or an institution, as exhibiting behavior that furthers or reinforces the system of racism. Now, I mentioned in the sentence between this paragraph and the previous one that racism depends on power to survive, well racist acts and institutions serve as that power putting people of color back in their place. I put an emphasis on power because many people call actions racist that are not actually racist. They may be reflective or a reaction to a racist ideology but they in of themselves are not racist.

Examples of this mix-up is when dealing with black people saying for instance “I hate white people, and they are all devils”. The Nation of Islam sometimes makes statements that refer to whites as literal devils and many black people make the first half of that statement just off the cuff. Most people would call that racist because it’s an unfounded feeling based on the color of someone’s skin. They are wrong. If I and every other black person in America says they hate white people, how does that further the racist system? It doesn’t because we have no power to do anything about it. If racism requires power to be implemented and protected then how does something like that count as racist? It can’t, and I will say that although it is indeed unproductive, it is in no way analogous to a white person saying the same thing about black or other people of color. They have a whole society with 500 years of experience to back their hatred. That’s power and that’s racism. Unfounded statements about a group of people made by an individual is prejudice more so than racism.

Related to the previous point, I also get a lot of questions from white and non-white friends on whether some act or something someone said (that’s a lot of somes) is racist or makes up racism. Now remembering that racism is a system of oppression not an ideology we know that systems create ideologies, institutions, and ways of being that further that system’s goal. In the case of racism, everything in American society (not to say any other country is absolved of this) is tainted in the racist system and it’s ideologies and language. So when someone says something like “black people are lazy”, they are being racist but at the same time everything we do is bathed in racist ideologies anyways. By that token we can call anyone racist really but the difference between something truly racist and something that's just ignorant is that the racist vs the ignorant person will say something like that to preserve their real or perceived privilege aka preserve the racist system. To realize that is to realize how much work it takes to not only destroy the system but also the simple act of converting someone over to the anti-racist struggle. People do many things that are racist and prejudiced and not even know it and that is an important point to remember as anti-racist activists. 

The Take Away:

    * Racism is not an idea but a system of oppression like capitalism and thus exist on material terms vs ideological terms
    * Racism depends on power to survive and getting people to not think racist is part of that but it’s not a complete solution
    * To constitute being racist or racism an action or person must have power to back up their disdain for the person their hatred is aimed at
    * Hatred of others that lacks power constitutes prejudice
    *  Knowing these simple facts will keep people from putting the anti-racist struggle in the wrong place (it’ll wither away after we destroy capitalism) and dealing with people correctly that we are trying to convert (racism is invisible to most white people)

[EDIT] a few random bits of the piece that seemed a little vague and altered the intro. I want to expand this so we can use it as a way cor people not really acquainted with racism or race period to navigate these ideas which are admittedly hard for some to grasp.

1330976866.0,42,self.SRSDiscussion,qiz23,How to deal with bullying?,dbzer0,46,4,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/qiz23/how_to_deal_with_bullying/,"[In this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/qhvwz/effort_what_do_i_tell_my_son_he_beat_the_living/), SRSisters are railing against the glorification of violence as a solution to bullying. But I am kind of divided on the issue. Let me explain why.

When I was a boy in Greek public schools in the 90s, I was in the unfortunate situation of being extremely introverted, nerdy and with what was, for the Greek society, an extremely obscure hobby - computers and particularly video games.  Whereas everyone else was talking about football or, later on, girls, I had only interest in discussing Monkey Island and Mortal Kombat. That was likely caused and exaggerated by my family moving around a lot and thus me changing schools every 3 years, thus not having any close friends. (There were other things that likely inflamed this but I don't want digress in my personal sob story :) )

As a result, I was a prime target for innescant bullying. Before age 12, it was merely verbal bullying, but in Gymnasium/Lucaeum (i.e. school for ages 12-18, what I guess you Yanks call ""High School""?) it escalated to physical bullying.

It started with a single slap on the back of the head, by a group of friends, on my first day at a new school. I looked as Dorky as humanly possible those days, and in my attempt to fit in the new school, I tried to ignore it. This was my first mistake. From then on, I was the slap-target. 

This spread and soon other teenagers started making fun of everything about me. I would come to class to find caricatures of me on the drawing board. People throw stuff at me during lessons, steal my stuff, ""secretly"" badmouth me just loud enough for me to hear it, try to slap me etc etc. And this wasn't one or two people. It was not even only my whole class. It was practically all classes in my age bracket. It got really really bad.  

I don't know why or how. But I always had a very defiant personality, so I started pushing back. When people insulted me, I insulted back. When they tried to cower me, I stood my ground. Most often than not, this escalated into fights. I would literally have multiple fights per month. My one-year-older sister used to joke that I fought half the kids in school. Sometimes I initiated the fight when I had too much. But most often than not, I managed to goad them into attacking me first.

I don't know if my defiance to take bullying passively helped or not, but people were less likely to bully me to my face. Things just turned very passive-aggressive after that. However it is not a stretch to say that my violent reactions did lessen the active bullying, and I could better ignore the rest. 

It is because of these experiences, that I cannot just accept what seemingly is a blanket-rejection of violence as answer. In my view, verbal and passive-aggressive bullying can be very emotionally harmful to kids, to degrees that easily challenge physical damage. It took me years to overcome the distrust and introversion I built because of it. It is because of this that I do not believe violence is out of the question as a response. One always has the right to self-defense to avoid being hurt. And if causing physical harm is enough to stop receiving emotional harm, I don't see why it shouldn't be on the table.

Of course we're talking about imperfect scenarios here. We're not talking about a working system where bullying is likely stopped by teachers or other students. We're talking about the usual situation where teachers are unlikely to care or act appropriately, and snitching on your co-students is likely to make the situation *worse*.

Note that I'm not supporting the act of the kid in the OP. I can however understand it because I've gone nuclear once or twice in my life after persistent bullying. I don't know the specifics of the situation, but I don't like the black&amp;white stance that SRS is taking on it, which  unfortunately just smells too much like privilege of never having to be in that situation.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,True,,,True,t3_qiz23,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/qiz23/how_to_deal_with_bullying/,

This got me to thinking a bit, both about my own experiences and those of others and while I think there are much worse insults, I feel there is a tiny grain of truth in that statement. Please hear me out in good faith and remember that I despise bigotry in any of its forms and am not trying to invalidate **anyone's** oppression.

First, I asked ""what is the worst insult one can receive as a white man? Specifically, that can *only* be targeted at a white man?"" Certainly not privileged. Just thinking about my own experiences, most stem from ethnicity. Nazi (my German heritage, it doesn't *only* apply to men, but I've never heard a woman called it due to her heritage, so just going off my own personal experiences) Kike (my Jewish heritage, the irony is not lost on me, this one may also be a wash, as it can be equally applied to women) Sheep Fucker (Scottish heritage) Rapist (being 6'2 and built like a brick wall, I've heard a pair of women talking about me who thought no one could hear them comment on how I looked like a rapist, which really fucking stings, although perhaps this last is simply only applicable to men, not just white men).

I've experienced prejudice like this and more that isn't just limited to white men (don't get me started on how many times I've casually mentioned I don't believe in god and seen the person I was talking with visibly shrink away and give me a frightened look). I don't want to try to play oppression olympics so I won't compare it to anyone else's experiences with dealing with prejudice, but once in a blue moon, when I notice a group of skinheads with swastika tattoos, yeah, it freaks me out a bit, because for some reason I imagine they *know* that I own a menorah and they're going to mess me up.

I think it's fair to say *everyone* has experienced some form of discrimination, some form of prejudice, some hatred aimed at them for ridiculous reasons. And many of you here who are more familiar with this horrible treatment than I am must know how badly it hurts for someone to tell you your own experiences are invalid. To grow up if something offends you, or to be more thick-skinned. Or even just have your experiences dismissed out of hand.

This is where privilege comes in.

The following is a generalization, and not in anyway representative of everyone:

Many times I see privilege used, it is used to dismiss a white man's experiences. This can and does often include times they have been discriminated against. Their experiences, their oppression, their pain is called meaningless and insignificant.

And they aren't. No one in the world has absolute privilege. Everyone has had to deal with some form of shaming, some form of insults, some form of hatred. Overweight people have to deal with fat hatred. Underweight people have to deal with being called ""skinny bitches"" or anorexic. Is one group more shamed by society? Sure. Does that make the shaming of the other any more okay? No.

So does ""privileged"" really stand up to many other slurs? Not really, but it does work to make the person feel as if their own pain is invalid, which is a terrible feeling and which shouldn't happen.

I get tired of all the rape jokes and sexual remarks that reddit likes to spew every time there is a post involving a woman. I get tired of every time there is a thread involving a black person who has committed a crime, the top rated comment is ""Don't be black, don't be black...damn it!""

These are just a few things. I know pretty much everyone here hates it. But lately it seems like it has gotten worse, and now when I see it happening I just want to turn off my computer.

Offline life isn't any easier; it's actually worse. At least online, I have friends and I see like minded people arguing the same points I agree with. Offline? I have almost no one.

It's not like I bash my friends or think I'm above them. I 100% don't! I also understand that people can't change their habits overnight, especially when everyone around them contributes said bad behaviors. Hell, when I first started this years ago, I was very frustrated over having to change my vocabulary. Of course, over time it's like anything, it's a habit now and I can't see any other way to think or act. I mention this, because when I talk to my friends or strangers, if they say something sexist that is normally considered 'okay' by most people, I don't get mad at them and give them a lecture, because I understand that my beliefs are not very popular and I have to be patient. I realize that they are not bad people, they are just, like I was at one point, misguided.

That being said... it doesn't make hearing or seeing their racist, sexicst, etc. remarks any easier. I visited some old friends last week. I hadn't seen them in almost a year. And we all realized how much I had changed whenever they would say jokes or repeat untrue 'facts' about race/gender/etc. Again, I didn't give them a lecture, but I guess something subtly gave away that I found their talk uncomfortable. And unlike the Internet, I can't just take my time to write out a thoughtful reply with sources if need be. I'm on the spot and put in an awkward position of trying to inform my friends without making them think I dislike them or I'm better than them. What ends up happening is I maybe get one point across, but it's so jummbled that it gets lost and I am disregarded.

I know a lot of people will just tell me I don't need them. But the problem is, in our world and especially where I work and live, I don't have time to find like minded people like me. Online friends are good and I am so thankful for them, but we all need human interaction. And most of these people are great, and nice, and I know they would never intentionally want to be sexist/racist/etc.

I feel like no one likes to invite me to things or be around me because they are afraid of offending me. And I understand that feeling. There is a woman I am friends with who is extremely religious while I am not. I don't judge her for her religion, but sometimes I find hanging out with her stressful because I have to watch what I say to not offend her (I cuss a lot, she doesn't like it, for example). So, I can totally get why anyone would not want to hang out with me. Who wants to hang out with someone who might get offended over...well, anything (even tho that's not even true, that's just what they think)?

As a result, I'm depressed, lonely, and I feel like no matter what I do, I'm fighting a losing battle. I feel like I need to choose between pretending to believe and be someone I'm not, or be alone while fighting a battle that seems to be losing its footing more and more each day. I can't just give up my morals and beliefs and go back to how I was. I just simply can't, it's way too ingrained and would feel like (I imagine) someone who is gay pretending to be straight just to please their parents.

I know this is bad thinking, and this kind of thinking doesn't make progress. Looking back on my older posts and threads is like looking at a different person. I was so much more active, excited, and no amount of downvotes or negative comments could bring me down. I looked *forward* to challenging people's views and changing their minds. Now? Shit, I can barely muster up enough energy to write out a paragraph, and lately I will just flat out ignore anyone who comments to me rather than reply and try to educate them.

Most, if not all, of us take issue with society's idea that the ""default person"" is a straight white male. 

Unless a person mentions they aren't white it is assumed they are white.

Unless a person mentions they are a women, they are assumed to be a man.

Unless the person mentions they are not straight they are assumed to be straight, and so on.


This happens a lot on reddit where a poster will be referred to as ""he"" unless they specifically state they are a ""she"" or their post implies such. (and subsequently are subject to harassment). A post where the OP mentions ""my boyfriend/girlfriend"" is assumed to be by a heterosexual, and this happens quite often in AskReddit. 

There is no arguing against the fact that doing such is problematic. 

However, I've noticed something that is pretty much the same going on quite frequently in social justice circles (SRS, different blogs on Tumblr) where a person who says something shitty is assumed to be a SAWCSM unless they state otherwise. 

If someone says something hateful towards women we will often attack them as a SAWCSM unless they begin the comment with something such as ""As a woman..."" in which case some members begin using the (also problematic, and luckily addressed by the mods as such) term ""Special snowflake"".  Even without mentioning gender, the term SAWCSM would supposed the person is straight and white, when it could be a gay and/or black man (or a person who is not ablebodied, or not CiS-gendered, etc) making a shitty comment regarding women.


Plenty of examples of this can be found within the fempire.  I am perfectly fine with SAWCSM being used to describe a person who suffers little marginalization compared to other groups.  My issue is using it as a term to attack people who say shitty things as it helps to reinforces the idea of the ""default person"".

It's kind of amazing that despite losing so much of the white vote, leading while under one of the worst recessions ever, and working in an incredibly polarized political climate, a person of color has been re-elected to lead America as its president.

**And how**!

[And there's actually women being elected too](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/11/2012-year-woman-senator)! Really awesome ones! Also, Alan Grayson is back in the House!

There have been some really great proposition wins as well; the DREAM act in Maryland along with marijuana decriminalization and marriage equality in several states being of particular note. And holy shit, three strikes is going to be gone in California!

Looking forward to 2016 and beyond, I'm especially thinking about three things:

* Where the hell are Republicans going to go now? Over and over again on CNN, MSNBC, and FOX, all I heard was the change in ""demographics"" or the ""demographic problem"" (read: Latinos). Are they going to try to really double down on white evangelicals (even more? is that possible?) or try to awkwardly pander to Latino voters who will be smelling their bullshit from a mile away? Marco Rubio isn't enough, bro dawgs.

* [Also, it seems like being a misogynistic asshole is going to cost you any chance at winning an election now (finally!).](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/11/gops-rape-apologist-caucus-did-not-fare-well-tonight/58770/) Redditors should probably pay attention to this one. Considering the hammering all GOP candidates received from women, it's also going to be interesting to see how Republicans address women's rights as well.

* After two terms of Obama, I am having a hard time seeing Democrats going back to a white dude for a presidential candidate. Hilary? Elizabeth Warren? Cory Booker? The 2016 primaries are going to be very, very interesting for both parties.

Finally, as Rachel Maddow said earlier tonight, this election is just as much a victory for Nate Silver and Sabermetrics as it is for Obama, people of color, women, immigrants, and LGBT people.

This is my 6th reincarnation on Reddit. What typically happens is I'll make a new account, and i'll post some comments, and i'll gradually get more and more known, until men begin hating me. They'll typically read my comments to gain information about me, and then send really mean private messages. And since they read all my comments, the longer my account exists, the more they can learn about me, the more cutting their private messages become. Also, there's behaviors like posting a comment on a thread, getting top comment on a thread, starting a new thread, that seem to really attract angry men.

So I thought to myself, ""These men have read too many of my comments. They know I'm trans, my boyfriend is trans, I live in a cold desert, my sister is a lesbian, and I work at a Starbucks about 1 hour from Alameda.

No matter how well I work on a comment or thread, after a month passes and there's many men sending me angry messages, I can't help but doubt myself and want to delete everything I've written and go hide. I know this is silly, because the people disagreeing with me are just angry men, who have no education or knowledge about feminism, but I still doubt myself when many people tell me I'm wrong.

I'm starting to think my cycle is flawed, too. When you keep reincarnating, its hard for anyone to learn who you are. Its hard to gain access to private and locked subreddits when you rise from the ashes every month or so. It's hard to make friends and have people recognize you when you're always burning bridges.

I don't want to discuss circumcision specifically on this thread.  I want this to be more general.  Please reply to the other thread to discuss that.

What I want to discuss, in a broad sense, is whether or not we should respect beliefs others hold which we do not, if there are some beliefs which merit more respect than others, and if the length of time a belief system has existed or the number of adherents should have any influence on the level of respect we should give to a belief system.

My personal view is that I completely, 100% support and respect the right for someone to hold a particular belief, but I do not feel an onus to respect the belief itself.  However, I don't think that this is a free pass to insult or mock beliefs for the sake of it, although I do support questioning and critical analysis of religious beliefs as a reaction to shitty things done in the name of a particular belief system.  That said, I absolutely do not support lumping every adherent to a certain religious denomination in together when doing this.

I don't consider any religious belief to be necessarily in any way more valid than any other, and I don't think that any laws should exist which give exemptions to those with religious beliefs.  We must have the same legal standard for everyone.

What does SRS feel?  

Should we have respect for the religious beliefs people hold, not just the right to hold them?  

To what extent should we question others' religion, and in what circumstances is it ok to do so?  Is it ever ok to mock religious beliefs?

When is it ok to call out people when they do or think things as a result of their religion?  I'm thinking the likes of routine infant circumcision or believing that homosexual acts are evil etc.

Do long established, large religions command more respect than small cults which have existed for a short period of time?

Hello friends,

I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this (and I apologize if I am wrong), but I have a bit of a dilemma, which I would like to hear opinions on in the context of feminism and social justice.

My girlfriend regularly goes to some pretty sketchy parties (""raves""), where it is common for young women to be sexually assaulted by men. My girlfriend is one of those young women. These assaults are usually random gropes/grabs with the occasional guy who would pull on her as shes trying to leave.

Now, when I heard about this, I got very mad. I got into a violent mindset and went over there with the intention to either get these people arrested or start a fight. She told me, however, that she could not identify any of them.

What concerns me is that my girlfriend does not really want me to do anything about these things. She has expressed to me that it is not worth it to try to do anything, and that my presence to try to ward off assailants (which I offered for future parties) is not necessary.

I understand fully that I should respect her wishes, but I find it very difficult to sit idly by while random men constantly assault someone I care about very much. It burns be up pretty bad. It also burns me up that this sort of behavior is seen as the norm, and that doing anything to counter it is excessive. Women should not go to parties with a prescribed assumption that they will get groped no matter what, and that is OK because it is common and normal.

I am posting here because I believe this issue should be discussed in a feminist context, with special attention being paid to not victim blame. I don't know what to do or think.

I re-read what I posted and the overall tone made me wish I'd taken the time to make my point clearer. I sound like I am saying 'no we are not great shut up' when in reality I think that though she is painting someone... some vague sort of ethnic group(?) into which I think I'm being lumped into, in a positive light, she is being really disingenuous. 

Ok, what my mom and grandmother do is amazing. But it is amazing because of its thriftiness, resourcefulness, etc. And, yeah, the shit they do I guess can be considered 'green', but it is also common in small towns in Mexico, actually everywhere here, for people to burn trash/tires, dump shit they don't need any more along roads/in dumps. Our lack of concern for the environment is actually something I dislike about my country. And saying something negative about my ethnic group/nationality is not the same as self-hate. 

More about my culture… the shit they do in my family (the stuff I called thrifty before) is probably similar to shit poor rural Americans do. I think poor people everywhere just learn to be more resourceful and that is great and should be looked up to. (I can't think of concrete examples, dammit). Yeah, and that’s it. That’s how I see it.This is where I start to get uncomfortable. Something your average poor rural Mexican/Latin American does out of necessity is not marketable to the middle to upper class social justice/activist/hipster/feminist crowd that reblogs her shit, I feel like. It needs to be made into something vaguely witchy/shaman-y/hippy-ish/pocahontas-ish, I don't know, and I think that's gross.

My second point... I feel like she's being sort of racist. This, I guess from her point of view was seen as me siding with 'the white people'. I feel like this is a rare example of someone actually feeling superior to whites and yet that post has 2000+ notes. Why did so many people eat that shit up? If you go through more posts you'll see

Ok, another thing. Why am questioning her background? I just want to know how that person came about. Non-indigenous (or at least not fully indigenous) people in latin america are not in touch with their indian side, we're too racist for that. I have a hard time believing she came into her muxeres/indigena philosophy naturally. As in, she's not just 'passing down wisdom from her foremothers' or some shit. I have a feeling she's from a middle class background and has pulled all these things from  different sources, added a healthy dose of bullshit and is now trying to market herself as some kind of indian guru shaman muxer person. I find it really offensive. I just don't know what the fuck I'm seeing. How can this person exist? Do I have a right to be offended? Is this even what is happening?

I could be totally wrong about everything. I just really want to hear people's opinions on this.

I'm a bisexual white male and I've recently had to contend with a male friend of mine making it a point to ""come out"" to me and the rest of our social group as a ""brony"" (A male fan of the My Little Pony show). He did this by sitting me down and telling me he had something important to tell me and then going on to dramatically reveal that he watched the show. Now, I am not he, and perhaps he really feels like this is something very difficult for him, but to me it all felt really feigned and when I gave him my completely nonplussed reaction he seemed disappointed.

He has repeated this whole ritual to other acquaintances and has so far failed to solicit any dramatic response. We're all geeks so quite familiar with non-mainstream/non-age-appropriate media.

A cursory google led me to believe this might be some kind of meme within the brony community, but I can't be entirely sure that this is not just him being very strange. My problem is that I can't help but feel like he's appropriating homosexual and bisexual terms by saying that he is ""coming out of the closet"". I've got passing-privilege and can decide to keep my bisexual status hidden unless I have a same-sex romantic partner, but I can't help but feel that he's making fun of the difficulties those who have to out themselves face.

To wit, there are worrying amounts of people throwing around completely unexamined privilege. Many of the statements about the military in that thread revealed, to my eyes, a startling lack of global perspective and an unwillingness to accommodate the views of others. Views that were critical of US foreign policy were decried as somehow being automatically problematic. There is a failure to realise that being born in the west, particularly the anglophone west, constitutes in and of itself a massive form of privilege. It makes you the benefactor, rather than the victim, of imperialism. Particularly in the anglophone west, it gives you the luxury of knowing your voice has the potential to be represented with reasonable accuracy to a global audience. It means having the distance to pontificate about the morality of military actions that we often have no direct stake in. It means benefitting from slave labour, IMF debt, forced regime change, unequal distribution of food and a hundred other injustices that are enacted on the national level.

At it's core, in how I find it's expression on SRS distasteful, there is that classic assumption of the privileged, that all others are like them until proven otherwise. I have seen an astonishing number of people, all across SRS, automatically assume that another poster is just like them. This assumption doesn't just run to the fact that the other poster is from the west, on SRS. It almost always seems to be the assumption that the other person is from the US as well. Not just in specific cases, but in general. People from the US may make up the majority of this site's demographics, but I suspect so do white men, and we would be justifiably critical if we saw people automatically assume that their whole audience was white and/or male. I'm only from the UK, which is pretty high up there with the US in the imperialist privilege stakes, and I find this assumption annoying. To someone from India (where, remember, 125 million people speak English), say, it might appear downright rude.

I would be interested on hearing if any other SRSers have noticed this, and what peoples opinions are. It would also be interesting to see if people have any thoughts on how to specifically recognise and check this form of privilege. I know that I, myself, am not always perfect at it by a long shot, but I do make an active effort to improve (much in the same way many of us struggle to fully remove ableism, say, from our language and thinking). There are specific language constructs we can look at. For example, one thing I always try to be sensitive of is referring to people from the US as 'Americans' and the USA as 'Americans', as I've spoken with quite a few people from central and south America who find this offensive and erasing. I wonder if some, for example, might find the term 'western' offensive, though I can't think of an alternative that's not obviously more so.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,1367363119.0,,,True,t3_159u5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/159u5e/western_privilege_and_usacentricism/,

I'm also a white woman with what is most likely one of the whitest USA/European genealogies (white north american colonists, irish, and english) ever and have no first-hand experience with native american issues so feel free to check my privilege. Also I call the Mayans native Americans because Central America is part of the Americas, if that's insensitive please let me know.

Background: I'll be honest, I think this 2012 Apocalypse stuff is garbage and could rattle on about why I think its fake/etc. But that isn't why I'm here. After I read some really disturbing articles about threats being made by people because they think the world is going to end like [this one right here](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/20/16042653-newtown-mayan-end-of-world-rumors-prompt-michigan-officials-to-close-33-schools?lite) which points out that some people have made very disturbing posts like &gt; ""Friday would be a great day to go out w/ a bang."" But I'm not here for that either.

 I googled people's responses to the end of the world thing and found some articles about both people trying to dispel the ""end of the world"" belief and people who believe in it where the groups were dismissive and marginalizing towards the Mayan people and their culture.

The first thing I read up on Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's tweets that hand-waved the entirety of Mayan culture which are showcased [here](http://www.racialicious.com/2012/12/05/starcrossed-dr-neil-degrasse-tysons-bizarre-anti-mayan-rant/) which culminates with him saying &gt; "" Hard to take seriously predictions about the end of the world from the Maya, a culture that could not predict its own demise."" These comments are very problematic, as the linked blog points out, because the Mayans are still here today, the idea they just ""mysteriously disappeared"" is totally made up. Also he says that the Mayans actually created a prophecy that the world would end in 2012 which is also not true, it's just the end of a calendar. I love Dr.NDT as much as any redditor but he should have at least looked into the issue more before saying anything.

The blog also points out [this rather damning article](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/10/24/mayan-demand-an-end-to-2012-doomsday-myth/) which states that the some of the leaders of the Mayan people are opposed to the ""end of the world"" festival beacuse it is both disrespectful of Mayan culture and a cash grab. &gt;The Culture Ministry is hosting a massive event in Guatemala City — which as many as 90,000 people are expected to attend — just in case the world actually does end, while tour groups are promoting doomsday-themed getaways.

&gt;Maya leader Gomez urged the Tourism Institute to rethink the doomsday celebration, which he criticized as a “show” that was disrespectful to Mayan culture.

I'd love to hear what SRSdiscussion thinks about these issues. Do you think we'll be seeing more things like the 2012 apocalypse phenomenon where the western world focuses on the beliefs of other cultures? Does the connectivity provided by the internet have anything to do with this? How does this compare to other questionable aspects of new-age spirituality like the appropriation of the customs of other native peoples? Will the mainstream media ever pick up on issues like this instead of just generating hype?

1351740711.0,39,self.SRSDiscussion,12fupo,How SRS made me turn away from Leftist politics (it's not why you think).,bluepomegranate,54,15,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/12fupo/how_srs_made_me_turn_away_from_leftist_politics/,"I've always been a pretty hardcore Lefty (for this, ""Left"" just means Communist/Socialist/Anarchist. I know they're different, but bear with me). Or at least I thought so. Then I found SRS.

Brd, was I shitlordy. Despite my feminist leanings and beliefs, I guess I'd say I was an armchair feminist. I said all the right things (patriarchy, privilege, slut shaming, etc.), but I didn't really *embrace* it. I was always coming up with excuses, or what I like to call ""But I'm different..."" syndrome. The classic ""Oh that poor person is on welfare? What a lazy bastard!"" ""I'm also on EBT/WIC/unemployment? Well I'm in a bad situation for the moment."" *MY* shitlordery came from a place of knowledge and anti-sexism! SRS, to put it in a short and sweet manner, bopped me on the side of head, cleaned out my mouth with soap, spun the looking glass inward, and turned my feminism up to 11.

Since then I've embraced intersectionality, and tried to fit both my feminist and Marxist beliefs (though I've mellowed out to democratic socialist, comes with age I suppose) together and create an awesome, anti-sexist/classist/racist/transphobic/homophobic system. I think I did alright. But how did SRS make me turn away from identifying with friends at /r/communism or /r/socialism (the two big ""political"" subs I was lurking for a while)?

The first /r/communism, I left because of a particular quote I read in SRS, and I won't be able to tell you where or who said it because it was so long ago. 

""A structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite."" - Kroptkin

Now I've never liked anarchism, but that's not important right now. What is important is this quote always stuck with me. And it's consistently repeated after ""successful"" revolutions. Russification and mass deportation in the Soviet Union, or the ""flower vase"" and selective abortions in the PRC. Both of these are racist or sexist in presumably Leftist political systems. [Heck, the failure to curb rape at Occupy Wall St. REALLY pissed me off.](/trigger)

I couldn't walk with those who proclaim that a quick revolution will fix everything without hitting the long-term social roots of the problem.

Now, /r/socialism. I can tell you exactly how it happened, because it was today. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/12eovf/to_all_the_socalled_leninists_that_say_stop/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/12bspp/stop_female_genital_mutilation/), and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/12ebmt/no_matter_who_wins_on_november_6_we_are_in/). Read the shitlordiness of those comments. Holy. Brd. Shit. The fact that ""socialists"" are endorsing the fuck out of ignoring racial/gender divides is frightening, angering, and disappointing to me. These fuckwits DO NOT give a fuck about anyone other than their SAWCSM selves, and are playing revolutionary as long as it's comfortable. Their fee fees are THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT MUST BE DEALT WITH ASAP. They are **SO CONCERNED** that dealing with immediate issues like racism and sexism will just be so **CONCERNING** that they will divide **CONCERNED** revolutionaries like themselves.

Oh look, apparently the thread didn't reach a sufficient amount of hand-wringing, so the egalitarians swooped in to fix the grievous plight of all good concerned folk who are not sure if their concerning concerns are being taken care of. I'm sick of manarchists, brocialists, broletariats, brolsheviks, Caummunists (Caucasian Communists), and assorted others who refuse to deal with the here and now in order to create the perfect abstract concept of smashing capitalism in the unknown future. At least some feminist groups incorporate Marxism/anti-classism into theories. Feminists have concrete plans to push back against patriarchy while these sky pie leftists crow on about how we're **CONCERNING THEM GREATLY** because we admit non-SAWCSMs get shafted a great deal more.

[A bit long],Dead_Dove,56,20,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/zdp4m/how_does_srsd_feel_about_the_word_virgin_being/,"This isn't something I see happen within the Fempire as much as some of the other circlejerk subreddits, but I wanted to post this here since I like the quality of discussion in the Fempire way more and I thought I could make it a bit broader rather than just a meta complaint.

Anyways, I'm a college-aged male with diagnosed social anxiety and depression. As soon as I start to get close with anyone I panic and my flight or fight response kicks in (of course I always choose the former). This (combined with some lingering trust issues I have with intimacy due to something that happened in my past) has kept me very solitary and lonely as I enter my second decade of being alive. At this stage in my life I feel that I only want to be intimate with someone I'm in a relationship with (No judgements to people who differ; I'm very sex-positive and for all I know I could change as I get older). Part of this is that I miss intimacy rather than sex, the other part is that hookup culture seems quite intertwined with rape culture and has a lot of shitlord type men around.

To cut to the chase, part of my depression is caused by how self conscious I am about my lack of experience in areas of intimacy, which is something I see as a failure of myself as a person (familiar thought patterns such as 'If everyone else can do it why can't I? I must be uglier, stupider, more boring, creepier etc. than everyone else,' dominate my depressive episodes). Seeing 'virgin' used as pejorative, either against sexist redditors to mock their low attractiveness to women, or by redditors at someone they consider 'beta', ugly, 'white knight', irredeemable nerd, socially awkward, just reinforces these feelings for me.

Just to clarify, my embarrassment isn't solely because I haven't had penetrative intercourse yet, but mostly because of my lack of experience within the whole realm of intimacy, from having a gf, kissing, cuddling to oral, penetrative yadayadayada. I feel like using virgin as a pejorative includes these things.

Okay so wow, my brief bio on how I began to think about this topic went on way too long but I had other thoughts on it as it relates to PUA culture, the domination and objectification of women, the hypocrisy of using it as a slur while slut-shaming women who embrace their sexuality or teen parents, when directed at men as a way to emasculate them, if people wanted to discuss these sorts of things in the comments.

TL;DR - How do people feel about using 'virgin' as a slur? Do you think it plays into gender role issues by reinforcing them? Do you think it's symptomatic of a culture hypocritical in it's views on sexuality? Can it be seen as ableist in a way?

I'm a 22 year old college male, my parents are indian but I was born, raised, and go to school in Boston. I just have this shitty, deep seated fear of women, and its something I really want to work on. I really don't like the fact that I have it, but its almost a physical reaction that its hard to know how to stop. The thought process I have whenever I go out is pretty similar to that MR poster. The idea that women I talk to are going to hate me or think I'm creepy or something. I'm sure this has a feedback effect, and any neutral observer would think a nervous guy constantly checking his phone and avoiding eye contact is bound to be a creeper. 

I can talk to women on a friendly level with no problems, some of my best friends are women and I can find them quite easy to talk to under casual circumstances. My real issue becomes when I have a group of friends I know quite well, and someone in that group knows someone else's group and we all go out to a bar or club together. I get along fine with the people I know, and I can usually talk to the guys in the other group but I just get this unrelenting inner voice telling me the new girls that I met hate me and that they don't want to talk to me and why should I even introduce myself I look so fucking creepy right now. Sometimes I can hold it together but a lot of times I just retreat to the bathroom stall and play video games on my cell phone before I excuse myself and go home. 

Does this just mean that I shouldn't go to bars/clubs? Or that I can really only deal with women in a 'sexual' manner if I know when in a 'friendship' manner first? I understand that this kind of stuff probably requires some level of therapy but I wanted to get some feedback here as well.

There was a post here about how some men who are ""allys"" of the feminist movement or identify themselves as feminist are being patronizing just by their involvement. I'm likely vastly oversimplifying here, but that's what I took from it. It was pretty heavily upvoted for this subreddit (+20~ vote)

Today on my college campus, there was the usual array of booths and tents set up for college kids to walk by. Today we had the pro-lifers (complete with five foot tall pictures of grotesque fetuses and megaphones) and pro-choice booths. 

There was a particular booth giving out shirts for their feminist organization. I went over to talk to them a bit and get a shirt myself. I just felt very... I'm not sure. Unwelcome? Alien, almost. All of the women manning (haha, puns) the booth were kind of looking at me from the corner of their eye... it was a very strange experience for me. They asked if I wanted a shirt, so I got a nice shirt and a pamphlet, told them I supported their message, and went on my way. 


It got me thinking a bit about my original question. Am I really ""needed""? My first attempt to do anything vaguely feminist outside of the internet made me feel incredibly weird... I've been trying not to throw my privilege around in real life now that i'm aware of it, but I think i'm starting to second guess myself.

I was reading this book because I saw a review of a different book about the same author on a panel book show. Basically the whole panel hated the book apart from one who was arguing that the author made such horrible women characters for equality reason, because women can be evil too. But this description in the book really annoyed me. What do you all think?

""That night at the Brooklyn party, I was playing the girl who was in style, the girl a man like Nick wants: the Cool Girl. Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: ‘I like strong women.’ If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because ‘I like strong women’ is code for ‘I hate strong women.’)

I waited patiently – years – for the pendulum to swing the other way, for men to start reading Jane Austen, learn how to knit, pretend to love cosmos, organize scrapbook parties, and make out with each other while we leer. And then we’d say, Yeah, he’s a Cool Guy.

But it never happened. Instead, women across the nation colluded in our degradation! Pretty soon Cool Girl became the standard girl. Men believed she existed – she wasn’t just a dreamgirl one in a million. Every girl was supposed to this girl, and if you weren’t, then there was something wrong with you.

But it’s tempting to be Cool Girl. For someone like me, who likes to win, it’s tempting to want to be the girl every guy wants. When I met Nick, I knew immediately that was what he wanted, and for him, I guess I was willing to try. I will accept my portion of blame. The thing is, I was crazy about him at first. I found him perversely exotic, a good ole Missouri boy. He was so damn nice to be around. He teased things out in me that I didn’t know existed: a lightness, a humor, an ease. It was as if he hollowed me out and filled me with feathers. He helped me be Cool Girl – I couldn’t have been Cool Girl with anyone else. I wouldn’t have wanted to. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy some of it: I ate a MoonPie, I walked barefoot, I stopped worrying. I watched dumb movies and ate chemically laced foods. I didn’t think past the first step of anything, that was the key. I drank a Coke and didn’t worry about how to recycle the can or about the acid puddling in my belly, acid so powerful it could strip clean a penny. We went to a dumb movie and I didn’t worry about the offensive sexism or the lack of minorities in meaningful roles. I didn’t even worry whether the movie made sense. I didn’t worry about anything that came next. Nothing had consequence, I was living in the moment, and I could feel myself getting shallower and dumber. But also happy.""

I've been smoking a lot more this year and I realize their attitudes toward women aren't much better than stereotypical frat boys. Women are often accused of mooching weed off of other people, posts on r/trees with women wearing marijuanna as dresses and titles like ""I would smoke that b[slur] up"" are prevalent, stoners often objectify women, and they are very fond of ""Reappropiating"" the N word. 

Overall I've found stoner culture to be slightly worse than mainstream culture in how blatant their racism and especially sexism is. I'm curious as to why this is, because historically stoners have been thought to be more liberal and open minded. I suspect it's because the stoner culture provides a ""relaxed"" scene where people feel like it's more acceptable to talk about their shitty opinions, but I don't have any proof. Your thoughts?

It's basically dedicated to good-looking guys around campus and encourages girls to take stealth photos of guys they find attractive and them submit them to the tumblr. It's been pretty much embraced by the girls on campus, and, from what I can, the guys don't mind/regard it as a badge of honor (though this is based purely on conversations I've overheard since I don't actually know anyone who's personally been posted on there.

With all the discussion here about creepshots, lack of consent, and lack of respect for personal privacy, I can't help but feel vaguely uneasy about the whole enterprise as it is similar in many ways to creepshots.

I do feel like there are several factors that set it apart from creepshots though. For one, few (if any, that I can tell) of the photos sexualize the guys to the degree that creepshots did/does, i.e. it's not just crotch shots or butt shots; you see their faces and most of the comments are along the lines of ""a suit and tie works wonders"" or ""cutie/hottie/hunk in [various locations]"" or ""Penn Badgley look-a-like!"" Obviously there's the occasional shirtless guy, but most seem to be ""that's a cute guy on this bus, let me take a picture of him"" and then that's that (i.e. there's not the stalking component).

And there's obviously no doubt that everyone's of age, since we're all college students.

But still, I can't help but draw some parallels to the creepshots situation and so I thought I'd see what everyone here thinks. Part of me thinks it's not too bad because it's girls taking stealth pictures of guys and there isn't the same kind of institutionalized sexism and objectification (and furthermore, the pictures aren't as blatantly sexualized), but the other part of me feels like that's a hypocritical view to take.

Whenever you see a large thread full of comments in one of the major threads they will gravitate towards either: 

a) a one-upping, pissing contest with ""jokes"", pun threads, or shitthatneverhappened.txt stories, *or*

b) a hateful environment, trying to ""take the OP down a notch"".

Neither of these two 'environments' are the result of a level-headed, honest community (only the smaller subreddits hold a sense of honesty and neither of these two things happen with any frequency in those subs) and both can be interpreted in one of two ways:

###Superiority

The pissing contests and the ""taking down a notch"" are very commonly seen in most traditional, all-bro groups in which everyone must show how stronger, faster and more important he is than every other dudebro.

&gt; ""Oh you bench 100kg? I bench 120kg.""

&gt; ""Just 120kg? lol I bench 6 tonnes.""

&gt; ""I could do 6 tonnes with [MY PENIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/mypenis).""

And so on. This is also behavior shown by elitist people, people 'in the know' in certain groups and communities. Take for example the one-upping that happens within gaming communities: You either see people trying to show others how better they are than them, or people trying to tell others how bad they are.

It's either

&gt; ""I'm so much better than you at this game.""

Or

&gt; ""You suck at this game.""

So the way Reddit acts can be read as them feeling superior to others and trying to remind everyone, every second, how superior they are. 

Do they feel better than everyone else in real life and translate those feelings to Reddit?

###Inferiority

Feelings of inferiority in real life fall apart when hiding behind the mask of anonymity and sometimes, people over compensate.

It is common for people that have failed in various areas of life to lie about what they accomplished when thrust into a community which will never verify those statements. 

Never picked up a single weight in your life? No worries: everyone here benches a comet before breakfast.

I actually had a friend whom I'd never seen with a woman. EVER. In three years. And I used to see him every weekend. But he kept telling me that he'd had sex with 300 women over the years I'd known him just because, somehow, he felt that lying about how many women he'd had sex with would help him get in our good graces. (*-shrug-*)

I feel that this can explain much: A Redditor feels wronged by a woman and gets online to shit on some woman for having pointy elbows. A Redditor is picked on by some guy who's bigger than him and gets online to tell everyone that his penis is bigger than everyone else's.

---

So, who are Redditors? 

Do they carry their feelings of superiority and elitism to Reddit from their own life, basking in a community that allows them to feel superior and elitist with a bunch of other superior and elitist bros?

Or do they act the way they do as an over-compensated reaction to being cast out from social groups, unable to get what they want and being (self-proclaimed) ""forever alone""?

---

DISCLAIMER: I am not a psychologist and when I say ""commonly seen"" I mean ""commonly seen by me, friends and acquaintances"".

---

tl;dr: Are Redditors really assholes, or just really sad?

One of the girlfriends                 said ""I just wish I could have protected him the same way he protected me"". A father Jamie Rohrs ran out off the theater left his girlfriend Patricia Legarreta and 2 children behind. he  came back when his girlfriend called him. Their is public outrage for Jamie Rohrs actions and some people are calling for his girlfriend not to marry him because he would not be a good ""protector"" and put his live on the line to save her. 

  Another man(complete stranger) Jarell Brooks shielded patricia legarreta and her 2 children with his body and got them out of the theater. In the process he was shot in the thigh. Is this type of behavior in men socialized? or is it just what the media focuses on?



Edit: Or is this instinctive behavior?

1339592448.0,36,self.SRSDiscussion,uzqre,A few questions on ableism,imsometueventhisUN,37,1,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/uzqre/a_few_questions_on_ableism/,"[I posted this as a comment on SRS in reply to a mention of ableism, and was recommended that I should bring it here instead]

I'd only heard of ableism once, in passing, in a list of other ""-isms"" that someone was reeling off - and, I must admit, given the person's sense of humour, I thought they were being facetious, and thought no more of it.
Having read this comment and looking into it a little (note: a little further! As in, reading the first few paragraphs of Wikipedia), I must admit that I'm a little confused - I hope you can help me out with understanding it further, either through your own interpretation or by recommending further reading.

Wikipedia states that the ableist world view is 'that the able-bodied are the norm in society, and that people who have disabilities must either strive to become that norm or should keep their distance from able-bodied people. A disability is thus, inherently, a ""bad"" thing that must be overcome. The ableist worldview holds that disability is an error, a mistake, or a failing, rather than a simple consequence of human diversity, akin to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender.'

Ok, with obvious disclaimers that Wikipedia is fallible and anyone's free to interpret new terms or worldviews as they wish, here are the main points I draw from that:

* 1.The able-bodied are the norm in society
* 2. [EDIT: I've learnt from replies that this was not what I meant, and a better phrasing would be ""People suffering from a disabling ailment should strive to overcome their ailment""] Disabled people should strive to emulate non-disabled people, or 
* 3. Disabled people should be kept at a distance from able-bodied people
* 4. A disability is a ""bad thing"" that must be overcome
* 5. Disability is an error/mistake/failing.


1. I must admit, I really was surprised to hear that this wasn't true, but a moment's reflection proved that (for sufficiently broad definition of ""disability""), it probably is. Just another sign that ableism (as here described) is widespread and ingrained!

2. Maybe I'm unaware of my own prejudices, but this seems like good advice. A disability is, by definition, something that makes you less able than otherwise. By contrast with, say, the statement ""people who are over a certain weight should strive to lose weight"" (which is complicated by the fact that people have different ""natural"" weights, influenced by genetic factors, and so there's no single ""healthy"" BMI for the whole population), there is absolutely nothing to be gained by not addressing and attempting to overcome a disability. The converse of this statement seems to be suggesting that people should not use reading glasses, wheelchairs, insulin shots, or hearing aids, which strikes me as absurd. I'm unable to reconcile this statement with the presentation of ableism as a bad thing. I guess I've either misunderstood the original statement, or misunderstood the definition of disabled. Can you help?

3. Dear God I hope that people believe this and this is just being used as a straw man argument. I fear I may be wrong.

4. See point 2. If it's not a bad thing, how is it a disability, and vice versa? This doesn't mean to cast aspersions on the person themself, but rather the disability - if the characteristic isn't a bad thing, why is it called a disability?

5. This strikes me as emotive language. Technically, it is a failing in the sufferer's genetic make-up, body structure, etc., but that doesn't imply fault or wilful negligence on their part. Again, I think I'm misunderstanding the terms, so I'd appreciate some guidance from someone who knows more about this subject.

For clarity: I'm not suggesting that ableism is a good thing, because, as it currently stands, I don't think that I know what ableism is. I'm stating that the description that I've read on Wikipedia isn't wholly bad, which leads me to believe that I've misunderstood the description, and asking for clarification.

A little background - I'm a 22yo Caucasian cis able male, so I fear I tick all the danger boxes of ""reeking of unexamined, toxic privilege"", as per the sidebar.

So for a very long time I was under the impression that I could limit what some would consider offensive humor to my very close friends. I at least knew they would not take it seriously. My best friend is gay and he has always made it clear that he does not find any type of gay jokes offensive (as a precaution I never make the same type of jokes in front of any of his boyfriends of the past bc I don't know their experiences and I would definitely not want to offend them).

So I was content to go along with my life making offensive jokes as long as I knew that none of my close friends would see it as some sort of truth. But recently, one of my roommates came out to me. It was actually quite a surprise bc I honestly had no clue at the time. At first I was very ecstatic bc he finally seemed to find some sort of peace and comfort within his life. I let him talk through everything bc I didn't want to interrupt him. Anyway, after a long talk he's gone off to a party now, and I realized that I would often make (now that I look back on it) very offensive and possibly homophobic jokes. I would use the F word with my roommate and make gay jokes quite often bc that is what I was used to with most of my friend.

My roommate hasn't indicated that he was offended by any of these actions, but of course, all of this happened like 5 hours ago. So who knows, he might actually be hurt by some of my words and actions. So, am I just a complete piece of shit? Should I apologize or not? Considering that he has not indicated that he took any offense to anything I said in the past.

I've really been trying to change for quite a while. I've been able to change my misogynistic attitudes over the last 6 months and I've been able to eliminate a lot of slurs from my vocabulary (mainly thanks to SRS).

Basically I'm just looking for some advice.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_te31f,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/te31f/recently_found_out_my_roommate_is_gay/,

(via bullying),Throwawaypreston,41,5,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/tdxxg/tw_what_do_i_say_to_the_person_who_nearly_cost_me/,"Throw away as quite personal details and I don't want anyone to creep me or anything. 

A few weeks ago there was a discussion about what to say to someone you possibly acted shitlordy to. I find myself in the opposite situation.

I attended a rather small primary school (18 people in my year!), as such we all knew each other intensely. I was a quiet, introverted, fat child who also happened to have (and still do thank you genetics) essential tremors, which amongst other things cause involuntary movement of the body. 

Now growing up I was incredibly self aware of all these things so as much as I could tried to mask them eg not drinking in front of other people, never volunteering to do demonstrations whatever. My class however were aware and for the most part remarkably accepting. 

Except for one guy, let's call him Richard.  He tormented me endlessly. From age 4 to 12 a small sample of what he did to me

Sneak up behind me and grab me, this would cause me to literally jump a foot off the floor.

Sit behind me in assembly and poke me in the side, this would cause me to have spasms which I often got in trouble for (for fidgeting). 

Show me up in front of the girls in the class, calling me ""shaky dave"" ""vibrator"" and any variation there of.

He sometimes physically beat me but that was rare

General snide comments, when it was commented on I had coloured in the lines in year 4 (which I know isnt an achievement for most, but for me it took me the best bit of an hour and I was so proud I wanted to show the teacher) he just said we've been able to do that since nursery, maybe you should be at shurbern school you'd fit in more (it's a school for people with special educational needs)

So at the end of year 6, when the end was in sight, I could finally escape him. I'd purposely chosen to go to a less well thought of high school just to escape him. We found out our sats results (the English kind. Basically 5 is the highest possible grade you can get at that age. And I got all 5s (science English and Maths). He however did not and when he found out my results he would not let it drop.

Finally it came to ahead on the school bus home where no teachers were there to stop him, he went both barrels. Asking me if I'd shaken and mixed our results up. When I just looked away he got out of his seat and started saying why are you ignoring me!? And started physically shaking me.

And at 11 years old, I started crying. In front of everyone. Who were all save a few, laughing at me. He was gloating and I just ran off the bus and walked the miles home. When I got home late my parents shouted at me (understandably they probably thought I'd just missed the bus and were worried) I didn't have the guts to tell them so I just muttered apologies and went to my room.

My father is disabled. He had a stroke when I was 4 years old and lost brain function (which of course Richard mocked often). As a result we had a lot of pills in the house. In hard to reach areas obviously, but I could get to them.  So I went and grabbed a hand full and took them hoping just to end it all. I purposely chose pain killer (I'll never forget them, codynamol, big ugly pink things) because there was a story line on a soap my mum watched where someone did similar.

I knew what the result would be, I just wanted it to be fast. Fortunately my mum could tell something was up and wanted to talk to me when she found me passed out on my bed. She immediately called an ambulance and well I'm writing this so obviously I'm still here.

Fast forward: I'm 22, went to a Good uni to get a good degree and now have a good job.

However the other week I saw him and it all came back to me. The nights spent crying, all the hurt and I broke down. I was with my best bro so he sorted me out but I realised there how it's still with me.

So i want to write a letter to him, or something, explaining what he did, and how the person I could have been will never be because of him. I don't want to be angry I just need closure.

Sorry for the length but this is one of the few places I feel I wont be judged .

I've also been learning about the history of social movements, and the ways in which violence has played a part in the history of social activism. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a great proponent of nonviolence and civil disobedience, but the Black Panthers clashed violently with police. Labor activists and anarchists bombed policemen and fought Pinkerton agents. The gay rights movement wasn't even *called* that until the Stonewall Riots.

Is it possible to achieve truly nonviolent social change? Does the fact that nonviolence can be a *lot* slower justify the use of violence? Does every social activist movement have a violent subset? I can't think of any violence within the women's suffrage movement, for example... but from Seneca Falls to the constitutional amendment took 70 years.

In particular, I'm hoping to learn about the history of social activism, and the ways in which the use of violence has helped or harmed progressive movements. And I'm especially interested in some good reading recommendations - I'm sure that progressives have been thinking about this sort of thing for a long time.

* Social security systems are being dismantled the world wide in favour of private solutions, most of which are grossly inefficient

I've been reading a lot of things about rape lately, the topic interests me, always has. There have been a couple posts about raping SOs that really freaked me out the last couple days. Basically, partner said no, person went ahead and kept pressing/did it anyway, partner didn't really resist or do anything about it, but the non-consent was (from what I could tell) already established. It seems pretty clear that the person understood either in the middle or afterward that this was a rape. Where it's freaking me out is that I've had this happen to me, a couple times. Where I've said no, I'm tired or don't want to and my boyfriend just keeps pushing and pushing. It's always made me feel shitty/angry afterward, but I've never really identified it as rape before. After reading these posts though.... For some reason I've kind of identified it more as shit PUA LMR tactics, more than rape, because really, I feel like I probably could have been clearer (although I guess ""no, I don't want to"" is pretty clear). And you know, he listened for a while, but then pushed again; it's exactly like how PUAs talk about LMR. Eventually my resistance is just gone and either he had sex with me without me doing anything like pushing him away, or I'm just like get it over with because I know you won't stop pushing every ten minutes until you do.

Anyway, reading the posts freaked me out. I don't really have a question, except to ask what your thoughts are on this? I know it sounds ""rapey"", but I don't know if I would necessarily classify it as rape myself, however, at the same time, the lack of respect to my own wishes and going ahead and doing it anyway also made/makes me feel violated and angry and shitty. But, I also didn't push him away or anything. Even when I talked to him about it, he justified it by saying sometimes I just needed a push - and didn't think anything was wrong with that. On the other hand, he also said he wouldn't do it anymore because it upset me. So I don't know...

A note: Please don't argue about legal bullshit here. I really don't give a flying fuck about it. I know the law, I'm talking about socially and not legally. Think rape culture instead of prosecution.

EDIT: Having received a number of responses about what I think about it, I'll add something I said downthread:
&gt;And I have a serious disconnect between allowing myself to admit I've been raped, even though it's actually happened before. The feelings are there, but using the words make me... uncomfortable. My life has been highly privileged and usually pretty damn great, so I almost feel like saying it reduces the pain other people do live with... almost like I feel like I'm co-opting the term, like I don't feel my issues are worth applying the label to, because my life isn't and hasn't been, on the whole, bad or terrible.

It's not quite lack of empathy but because I have never been at the end of the stick with those words. I've been privileged enough where my asian/korean ethnicity was never a major problem and the racist comments were often in good humor. I never been raped. I never been molested. I haven't lost family members to various types of disasters. I have been privileged enough that because the community was so accepting that I've never seen the end result of a serious hate crime or bullying.

All this leads me to believe that because I'm not personally invested in many of the comments I can laugh at them or make special snowflake comments at people being offended by Asian jokes (though I stopped that now). I recognize the hypocrisy of not being able to laugh at Korean colonization or jokes made about rape of nanjing but it furthers my idea that personal investments makes a great difference in one's ability to laugh at things.

It's hard to reconcile with sometimes as I know I should not find it funny but I find myself laughing at 
[a joke using the word faggot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCIWsfPxJ2k), or the jokes that tries to be ridiculously offensive ranging from the Holocaust and others. 

At this point I've resigned myself to appreciate that at least I understand why the jokes are offensive to some and have tact not to go spouting it over public places like a dysfunctional water fountain.

Only one other time in my life has a boyfriend called me that - I was 16, it was on AIM chat, and I was more angry than scared. Now I was dealing with the fact that someone I loved, someone I wanted very badly to respect me, had crossed a line that had gone untraveled for ten years. 

I know it's because of my political/moral beliefs about slurs, but having been called that made me feel immensely devalued. He couldn't have known all the layers of meaning behind his choice of words, all the association I have with it, but he had some idea. He knew it would hurt me in a deeper way. It wasn't the first time he's screamed at me, called me names, or been physically imposing and threatening, but it was different, somehow. I wasn't just ""bad"" - I was ""bad woman.""

The very next day I drove him out to the country so we could have time apart. While there, I was having a conversation with somebody about my car. I love my car, like, way too much, and I often refer to her in endearing terms. So after I had extolled her virtues, I found myself patting the steering wheel, thinking privately…""Yup, I love this b*tch!"" 

It surprised me, as it always does when things pop into my head that sound totally foreign to me. But then I realized that a girl I'd met at a party had recently said the same about *me* to someone else, and I had found myself grinning at the time, with a little pride.

Had I claimed this word already, somehow? Was my feeling of devaluement and embarrassment and shame, after having it lobbed at me, somehow related to my sense of betrayal when a word I'd subconsciously reclaimed was turned around on me? But it was a relief, actually…it was already part of my identity, deep down. I could get over the shock of hearing it used as a weapon against me. 

So I'm here to ask you folks…what words have you taken back? When a word has been used to make you feel lesser, because of some privilege you lack or difference you appear to have, whether it's an official ""slur"" or not…what have you reclaimed, and incorporated into your identity by choice? Has it changed you? I would like to hear your stories.

I recently took a course at my University called History of Espionage, which examined the use of Espionage throughout History (imagine that) all over the world. The interesting thing (besides the course as a whole) was that we spent several weeks just examining the Native American use of espionage against Europeans (the details of which will make up the second half of this post, for whoever is interested). This was fascinating to me because typically, any discussions of European or American colonialism on North America tends to portray the Native Americans as if they just passively awaited everything that happened to them, rather than actively participating in their own history. There is most likely a ""History is written by the victors"" reason for that, and I see that as being closely tied to white privilege. I'd like to get a SRS perspective on this; anyone else know of any similar times in history of which we have a limited perspective? Anyone know any good resources to learn more about white privilege in history?

**TLDR**: I'd like to discuss white privilege's role in the history we learn.
___
Now, for the second part of my post: again, you can ignore this part, this is just my own contribution to this discussion.

Typically, when we learn about the story of Thanksgiving, we learn of the kindly Native American Squanto who taught the former passengers of the Mayflower how to survive because...erm, they were Europeans, what other reason did he need?

The actual story, as historians have begun to piece together, is much more interesting. Tisquantum (Squanto's actual name) belonged to a Native American nation that was actually not at all native to the Massachusetts area, but he had been previously captured by the Europeans, enlaved (during which time his original nation was wiped out by diseases the Europeans had been carrying), and then captured by the Wampanoag, the nation that *was* local to that area. The Wampanoag were in very poor shape by this point; they too had been ravaged by European diseases, but their population had stabilized before they were wiped out entirely by them. Problem was, their neighbor nation the Narragansett, had not been affected by the diseases at all and were set to conquer the Wampanoag in their weakened state. 

It was around this time that the Mayflower touched down at Plymouth, and Massassoit, the leader of the Wampanoag, recognized an opportunity when he saw one. He decided to ally himself with Plymouth, but here is the interesting part: it wasn't to make the Wampanoag stronger militarily. Rather, it was because the Narragansett were already trade partners with the English, and Massassoit gambled (correctly) that they would not risk endangering that partnership by attacking another group from England. 

That's right, the decision was motivated by politics rather than raw military strength. Quite a bit more complex than Native American motives are typically described as in pop culture, eh?

Anyway, Massassoit wanted to set up this partnership, but he knew no English, and his ally Samoset knew only a smattering. So they were forced to turn to their captive, Tisquantum, even though they did not trust him, because he had learned fairly fluent English while he was enslaved. So they used him as an interpreter, a deal was brokered, Thanksgiving was born, yay!

Most history books stop there, but mine did not because Tisquantum was a sly, clever man. After relations between the Puritans and the Wampanoag flourished, Tisquantum began going out of his way to ingratiate himself to the English so that they would begin to expect him to be with them more often, and so he had a reason to be away from the Wampanoag who still considered him their captive. Once his own place was secure, he began feeding the Puritans lies about Massassoit: he doesn't like you, he is plotting against you, he wants you all dead, he plans to attack you. Because the English trusted him so much, they began preparing their militia, which made the Wampanoag ill at ease and so *they* began preparing for war. It was essentially a Cold War, and Tisquantum perpetuated it out of a desire to supplant Massassoit as head of the Wampanoag. It almost worked too, but Tisquantum was found out literally on the eve of war, and he fled to the English who harbored him for the rest of his life.

That's some Game of Thrones level shit, why did I not learn about *that* in middle school?

The other significant Native American we learned about was Pocahontas, and if you thought your perceptions about Tisquantum were wrong, just wait. First off, I recommend that everyone here read ""Pocahontas: Medicine Woman, Spy, Entrepreneur, Diplomat"" by [Paula Gunn Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Gunn_Allen). I cannot recommend this book enough.

Now, I won't go into as much detail on Pocahontas, but suffice it to say: everything Disney had to say on the subject was wrong. She was not the daughter of her community's chief, she was a medicine woman (John Smith assumed she was the chief's daughter because why else would he listen to a woman?). Pocahontas was her childhood name; by the time the Europeans arrived, she was known as Matoaka. She did not ""save"" John Smith because he was not going to be killed; he was at a ceremony that certainly would have *looked* like an execution, but it was not, it was simply a way of integrating Smith (and therefore Jamestown) into the chiefdom (which, by the way, was actually a collection of communities that were collectively called the tsenecommocaw, which was a subset of the Algonquin nation). And here is the most interesting thing of all: she was not captured against her will, she staged her own capture (and it had to be her because she was already held in high regard by the English because of John Smith) so that she could more effectively spy on the English and pass information back to the tsenecommocaw (EDIT: Or so Gunn Allen believes, but she based it on a fair bit of evidence that makes a lot of sense to me, personally). So once again, we have a case where a Native American was considered a passive participant in history, when she actually had *much* more agency than we gave her credit for.

Another, somewhat unrelated but interesting fact: you may know that Pocahontas married John Rolfe in Jamestown. It's truly odd, though, that that is all Rolfe is known for nowadays, because he was *extremely* important to European history. You see, before coming to America, Rolfe had somehow managed to procure Spanish Tobacco seeds, and with the tsenecommocaw's help (and Pocahontas's in particular), he manged to blend it with American tobacco and make a variant that was reportedly so amazing it broke Spain's economic stranglehold on England.

I would definitely argue that such a thing exists in the United States (never lived in another country so I couldn't say for sure about Europe or other places that at least pay lip service to separation of church and state) and it's my understanding that a pretty large portion of Reddit is atheist. I don't feel like playing oppression olympics and obviously don't support the co-opting of the struggle of African Americans by white atheists to make a kind of ridiculous point, but there are parallels to most other forms of privilege in that atheists in the United States hypothetically have total legal equality but do end up getting the shitty end of the deal because of their beliefs at times.

Just wondering if anyone has ever tried this, and how it worked out, because I do know a few atheists that are hostile towards the idea of white privilege, male privilege, heterosexual privilege, etc. and I think I will probably use this strategy the next time it comes up with them.

EDIT FOR CLAIRTY: I'm **not** (I would've thought obviously, but it's probably my fault for unclear wording) suggesting someone make the stupid kinds of comparisons made in the video. The only comparison I would be okay with making is the fact that they are both forms of privilege, and since Christian privilege isn't actually something that's legislated it's good for demonstrating a key point to the generic idea of privilege itself (without even having to compare Christian privilege to other forms of privilege in the real world), which is that it's not always a legal issue.

The statement itself confuses me because it seems to me that it oversimplifies the situation.

The idea that rape is never mostly about sex just seems unlikely to me.

Also I don't understand is why people feel that this distinction is so important. Rape is a sexual violation -- otherwise it would be assault. If a person decides to rape another person for whatever reason, why does it matter if the motivating factor is to assert power over the victim or if it is to obtain sexual gratification?

1325535985.0,32,self.SRSDiscussion,o04z9,Thoughts on tone argument,3DimensionalGirl,40,8,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/o04z9/thoughts_on_tone_argument/,"So, you may or may not have heard of [tone argument](http://abagond.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/the-tone-argument/).  It's a derailing tactic where a person basically tells a minority or advocate that ""If you hadn't used such abrasive language/sworn/been so angry, people might agree with you more.""  

I have reservations about tone argument because I want to believe that there are people who genuinely want to learn who are then sworn at and told off without being given the benefit of the doubt.  I don't think swearing and anger should be the first response to a politely worded, if misguided, question.  It's true that defensiveness and name-calling will not ingratiate someone to your side.  Also, I worry that it feeds into the ""You're just looking to get offended"", ""Hysterical woman"", ""Angry black man"" type of thinking.  I don't like to seem as though I'm proving the bigots right to those lurking/reading.  I'd rather the bigot look like the unreasonable one.  

HOWEVER, I've also seen tone argument used as a silencing tactic, which is not cool at all, and it usually happens after the person being accused of ""being too angry"" is driven to anger through obtuse arguing and trollish comments.  It has happened to me before.  I try very, very hard to explain calmly and rationally why something upsets me, and after repeating the same talking points five times and getting nowhere, I do start to resort to anger, frustration, and swears.  And when someone then comes back with, ""Whoa, why are you so mad?  You need to calm down.  I'm just asking a question"", it's basically [gas lighting](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yashar-hedayat/a-message-to-women-from-a_1_b_958859.html).    

Basically, I think it's not cool to take the idea of ""tone argument"" to mean ""I can swear and generally act like an asshole and you can't call me out on it because TONE ARGUMENT"", but people who deal with this stuff all day DO get frustrated and are so sick and tired of explaining themselves. And they have every right to express their frustration and anger. 

I think tone argument makes the most sense when someone is criticizing someone's blog post as being ""too angry"" or ""maybe if you hadn't used the word 'fuck' so much, it would be more persuasive"". Because in that case, this person was in their own personal safe space and they can do whatever they want in there and it is not their job to educate the rest of the world. They just wanted to rant about how sexist Scott Lobdell is (for example).  [The twitter war](http://luciazephyr.dreamwidth.org/548703.html) between Lucy and Jim Butcher (of the Dresden Files) concerning his reaction to [someone's blog post](http://chloehasalotoffeelings.tumblr.com/post/7266336639) calling his books racist is a great example of tone argument in the wild.  

Basically, I'm torn on the idea of tone argument because on the one hand, I think ignorant or misguided people should have somewhere to go in order to be educated and informed, otherwise how will their opinions change?  Or the opinions of people on the fence who are just reading the conversation.  But on the other hand, it's not the minority's job to educate everyone on all these issues either.  And they have every right to get upset and swear and tell people to fuck off if they want to.  I guess that I believe tone argument has a time and place.  In SRS proper, it's all about the jerk and complaining about tone would not be taken seriously, but here on SRSD, we do try to respond rationally and calmly to posters so I think we would have the right to call out someone using loaded language.

For example if you are an agriculture major you can take a class that takes a critical look on globalization and sustainability in agriculture.   

I believe this needs to be expanded to STEM fields.  Have classes within these fields that count for humanity credit that analyze issues within these fields such as lack of female representation in STEM, classes that are critical of evolutionary psychology, economics classes that are critical of neo-liberal economics, animal rights in the field of biotech etc.  
  Also accelerated schools  need to be discouraged.  Too often I see peers from these schools graduating with a extremely limited view of the world.

So I'm a white, middle-upper-class privileged Irish-American dude. And I'm dating an Filipino-American woman. And it's great! 

But I'm scared to death of introducing her to my family. I have a *huge* Irish family. They're very loud, very welcoming, love to drink, love to throw parties, etc. And they'll love her to death--she has a similarly-sized family back in the old country, she's incredibly funny, she's got a wide range of interests to talk with them about, she loves beer like we do, etc. 

But they're going to crack Filipino jokes. Back in my teens, we employed a Filipino housekeeper who was infinitely quotable and said bizarre things to my friends and family every day. I got pretty good at doing impressions of him and recounting his strange stories and idiosyncrasies, because at the time I didn't realize the really troubling implications of a rich white kid making fun of an employee and imitating his accent. 

Around the same time, I was also hugely into anime and manga, so I'll get a twofer when she meets them: they'll immediately make jokes about her and this housekeeper and mock what may very well be her grandmother's accent, and they'll also make jokes about me finally getting ""an Asian girlfriend,"" never mind the total oblivious assholishness of conflating Filipino and Japanese culture because heyyy, they're both *Asian.*

I've tried to tell them I don't want them doing any of that. I've explained I'll never tell those jokes again, I've said a room full of white people making a big deal out of her ethnicity will make her feel totally unwelcome, I've flat out told them they're not meeting her until things change. But they don't get it, and they handwave away everything: ""[Housekeeper] was just a funny guy, his accent could come from anywhere, it could be any wacky Asian accent!"" ""It's just funny, she's Asian and you liked Asian cartoons, so why shouldn't we bring it up? It's just a joke!""

I love my family, they're an important part of my life and if this relationship continues this is something I'll have to deal with. But...how? And what do I say to her?

&gt;""I feel like this is a really simple question, mostly because it's such a common thing in life that I should have figured out how to respond by now...

&gt;When complete strangers say creepy/inappropriate/rude/well-meaning-but-sexist/etc comments, how do you respond? What about when they are customers? I'm always too caught off guard to respond, but it's become infuriatingly common at work lately.""

The first response on our other board asked what kind of comments so she elaborated.

&gt;""Yeah I am having a hard time even putting into words how broad of a question I am asking. But 1) I wish I had a couple of quick responses in my back pocket that I could just say without thinking instead of how I usually ignore comments and am friendly while I hurry the transaction along to get them the fuck away from me. Makes me feel like I'm approving whatever they said/did and like I'm being extra subservient. 
and 2) I feel like if I think about it enough, I should just be able to solve it. So I guess that will be nice when I finally solve sexism for everyone...


&gt;Customer I have never seen before, after I turn around to hand him a cup of coffee: Mmm... you look nice in a skirt.

&gt;Regular customer, in response to my ""haha, I swear I'm not following you, I'm just trying to give the place a quick sweep"": Hahaha, that would be okay if you did follow me everywhere, I wouldn't mind at all if you were that close to me.

&gt;Customer who has been in the store for many hours: I've been watching how cute you've been looking all day long today.
Which I ignore and continue with the transaction. Then: You're so cute; you don't even believe me how cute you are!

Obviously the retail environment is the key factor. Babby and I are in no way opposed to compliments. But both of us are a peeved by ones that have to do with 1. things we can't control. ""You have such pretty eyes."" and 2. Things that reinforce shitty norms ""you're so thin."" 

But yeah, in the retail environment something like ""You're so cute."" is more  hostile. The customer has a captive audience that is there specifically to be nice to the customer.  It's not totally covered in her own text so I want to emphasize that if she ignores an unsolicited compliment and just carries on taking their order in a friendly way, the common response is to press it with something like ""Really? Nothing?"" or ""Someones in a grumpy mood today.""

Which is just super infuriating because its like ""I'm obviously doing something you don't wish to acknowledge, but you're not getting away that easy.""

I'm at a loss because I'd want to go with something like ""Really? That's what we're going with? You're going to demand a response on an unsolicited comment on my appearance that its obvious I'm not into?""

It's been bothering me a lot that OP wrote ""aren't building true loving relationships the ultimate sign that you are truly inviting of one's culture?"" 

I'm a white-identifying straight guy (I qualify as Native American due to documented Cherokee history, but I mostly look and was raised ""white""). I'm in an interracial relationship with an African-American woman who really lights up my world. Seriously, I don't know how I'd make it without her smile. but you wanna know why we're together?

It's not because I'm ""accepting of her culture."" I mean, I definitely am, don't get me wrong. But that's not the *reason* we are. We're together because we love each other. And if two white people love each other, does that mean they aren't accepting or are less accepting of other cultures? I guess my major problem with this line is it makes me feel like our relationship isn't about love, it's seen as some kind of ""status symbol"" about how accepting we are. That's not it at all, though. We share a deep, deep love.

But what made me even more upset was [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/16zrjk/why_not_interracial_relationships/c80wcwp) comment. It and the amount of support it received also made me feel like people don't value our love. Like it's just some kind of thing where I'm automatically dominating her just because I'm a guy. But she's who I fell in love with, and I wouldn't change anything about that. I don't see how SRS can be so... mean. I get a lot of similar sentiment due to my location (""Haha, nice one! Takin' their women!""), and it makes me so, so sad. I just love her.

We get a LOT of shit from people, and SRS is the last place I expected we'd get more. She was ""excommunicated"" from her family for being a ""traitor"" and laying with the white man. I get crap from my family for ""pissing [my] heritage away."" We live in Kentucky, (and yes, I have the accent), so you can imagine how much more difficult that makes it.

a) Why do we tend to have a double standard about this with celebrities? There exist literally hundreds of subreddits dedicated to drooling and masturbating to non-sexual images of attractive celebrities (ladyboners, gentlemanboners, emma watson, benedict cumberbatch all come to mind) and yet no one seems to care. Don't celebrities have the same right to bodily autonomy as everyone else even if they're public figures; aren't these subreddits essentially fulfilling the same shitty purpose?

b) Is it somewhat shitty to masturbate to non-sexual memories of other people around you as well? If they never consented to giving you sexual gratification, then aren't you still somewhat violating their bodily autonomy by getting off to innocent memories of them in non-sexual contexts?

For those not familliar with either, I'm terrible at succinct explanations so [here's a link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cards_Against_Humanity#Gameplay).

I've enjoyed playing this game a number of times without really giving it much thought. Most of the humour comes from how well the cards match up plus shock value. Some of it can be incredibly offensive and insensitive, but the rounds are played in fairly quick succession so even when I've had a few moments where I've thought ""Should I even be laughing at this?"" the next round starts and there hasn't really been any time to dwell on it.

What got me really thinking was recently attending an improv comedy show that encorporated the game into the act. They had some audience members ""playing"" the game, and then the troupe had to do an improv scene about the winning combination. Sitting through several minute skits where the the punchlines were basically ""incest!"" or ""trans* people!"" or ""pedophilia!"" or ""racism!"" (among others) certainly shed a new light on the kind of ""jokes"" that the game can and often does produce. 

Now I firmly believe that the improv show was a bad idea. While admission was charged, it was performed in a public cafe so it's entirely likely that there were people in attendance that had little to no idea about the nature or content of the game, which along with having potentially problematic question cards (eg: ""Instead of coal, Santa gave bad children ____ this year"" can lead down some dark roads) has some straight-up problematic answer cards like ""The Gays"" and ""Passable Transvestites"".

The part where I'm a bit unsure is deciding whether playing the game with your friends in private is fundamentally different than performing it in public. Does playing the game with people who are entirely aware of the potential offensiveness, with the express purpose of being as offensive as possible make it any less problematic? Is the game intrinsically problematic due to how it fosters insensitivity and makes jokes out of serious issues, or are the combinations that get the biggest laughs by being awful indicative of broader issues that extend beyond the game? Does this fall under the ""It's possible to enjoy problematic things"" concept, or does participation in the game change things? Or, am I just trying to make justifications because I don't want to feel guilty about having fully enjoyed it myself?

Greetings SRSD! I am currently working/observing in a sub-Saharan African country for a local NGO (non-government organization) that promotes peace, reconciliation, anti-corruption, and good governance with a little bit of development on the side.

A little bit about me: I'm an American SAWCSM and graduate student getting a Master's in Conflict Assessment/Management/Resolution. My university sent me here to observe and help where I can, as the country I am staying in saw a lot of tribal-based violence some time ago(thousands dead and tens of thousands of IDPs[internally displaced persons]). With elections coming up soon, a lot of civil society/government groups are working to prevent a repeat of what happened before. Since my focus is on conflict/peace, myself and my colleague were sent for the summer to see what they're doing, find out how applicable our academic knowledge is to the situation, and provide any assistance we can for them (technical skills such as grant writing and evaluation design are sorely needed).

I have lived in developing countries before, but this is my first time in Africa. I lived for 1.5 years in both urban and rural China as well as some time in India, though that was just in one city (neither were for peace work). So I may also be able to answer some questions about those areas/living abroad if you have any.

I've spent a lot of time out in rural areas as well as in the capital talking with government and civil society groups to pick their brains. I've also had some talks with (former) anti-colonial resistance fighters (though this was much more limited due to time constraints and I hope to meet more in the future). I was living out in villages for the past few weeks, observing workshops done by our host NGO to see how grassroots groups work directly with the people.

I am also sure that most of us know people who are or were in the military. 

recently, a very good friend of mine has developed a serious relationship with a man in the Navy. she revealed to me that he has been involved in operations that go beyond what most Navy personnel have to deal with. he doesn't just chill on the ships. he has lived in caves in Afghanistan, he has seen combat, and he told her that he has indeed killed people. (he is not the only person that I know who has done such things in the military, but I'm just using this person as an example.)

see, I struggle with this. I have met my friend's partner, and he is a nice guy. he is respectful of my friend and to everyone. He is really just like anyone else. but when I think of the things he has done in the military, I just get so uneasy. I know he is just following orders. my issue is with the mentality that goes along with following orders. When I think of ""military culture"" and the things that the military preaches; when I think of how my friend's partner probably thinks that what he did was justified in the end (even if he might struggle with it a bit), I can't help but feel really disturbed and creeped out by him.

Some of my radical/anarchist friends have a very flippant view of people in the military. ""the military is evil, ergo everyone in the military is an enemy. Soldiers and the like are defenders of imperialism and have lost their humanity."" I like to think that it is usually more complicated than that. I hate the military as an institution, but I don't want to hate individual people in the military... at least not the people on the bottom of the hierarchy. I think that often, they are people who might not have had a lot of chances to build a career at home, so they see the military as a way to make something of themselves. but sometimes they have to pay a terrible price and they change. I don't want to sound condescending but I almost think of military personnel as the ultimate victims in the first world and I really feel sorry for people who come back from overseas with PTSD or worse.

this is kind of all over the place but I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm having a hard time reconciling my hatred for the military *as an institution* with my desire to see individual sailors, marines etc as normal people who just have different opinions than I do. Thoughts?

The goal of the presentation was to get young (most people in the audience were 18-20 and out for a year or less) LGBT-identified people to think more about their identities in a more mature way.  The centerpiece of my presentation included drawing 4 boxes on the board; one for L,G,B, and T (I added a caveat that this wasn't all-inclusive and people should choose the box they most identified with) and fill them with expectations for each box (for example, gay men like techno, lesbians like flannel, etc.), and the ultimate goal was to get them to realize that there really isn't a right or wrong way of being LGBT.  As I'm explaining how I wanted this exercise to go down a girl in the back raises her hand and asks ""where's the box for allies?""  I explained that I hadn't included one as this was a topic for queer-identified individuals but as always allies were welcome and were welcome to contribute.  The girl said oh and kind of sulked for the rest of the presentation.  Overall, my presentation was a rousing success and I feel like I had achieved my goals. 

A few days later I ran into a friend (who is also the student group's president) and she told me they had gotten a few complaints that my presentation wasn't ally-inclusive and they had felt marginalized.  I again apologized and said that wasn't my intention but I didn't feel like straight allies needed to be told that were still straight even though they might not like a lot of the things stereotypical straight people like.

The whole situation kind of made me roll my eyes and I had forgotten about it until a week or so ago when my friend brought it up again.  She made a pretty simple statement that got me thinking: ""Why do we give so much status to allies in our community?  I mean they're doing what I'd expect a decent human being to do, so why do we always have to bend over backwards to make sure we're being ally-inclusive?""  Honestly I find myself agreeing with her.  

Why does the LGBT community reward allies so much?  I consider myself to be an ally of both the trans* and the feminist communities but I don't expect all their meetings to answer or even address ""what about the men/cisgenders?""

Some of you expressed interest in me taking this issue to this subreddit, and so I have.

Children and youth these days face a multitude of issues. Many children in North America are [force-medicated](http://www.cchrint.org/tag/forced-medication/) for a variety of reasons, the most popular being ""lack of respect for authority."" [Solitary confinement](http://www.informationliberation.com/index.php?id=26314) is also part of this two-pronged approach when it comes to the infamous industry of Child Psychology. Very often, autistic children, or children who are otherwise overstimulated and extremely anxious/depressed, are force-medicated and isolated by these social workers and psychiatrists in their own schools.

I, too, was force-medicated and confined against my will for non-violent, non-distruptive behaviour. My mother was abusive, and I am slightly autistic, and the result was a slightly neurotic, depressed child who was afraid of expressing emotion. Despite the fact that I never once had a violent outburst, my behaviour was seen as ""suspicious,"" and so I was given the full treatment. The experience galvanized me and turned me into a Youth Rights advocate at the age of 11 - and some social workers, who were sympathetic, tried to help me, shortly before they were fired for ""interfering.""

So, I am discussing and advocating against something that has directly impacted me in the past. What happened to me happened over ten years ago now, and yet, the same invalidating, abusive behaviours continue against children in supposedly ""mainstream"" institutions (like our public schools)  on a daily basis. I often imagine what kind of abuse a child who is slightly 'different' is faced with, even to this day, as I pass by any primary school I come across - including the institution that I was at, which continues to run with even greater capacity than before. 

Youth Rights is a Feminist issue because it is directly involved with ageism and ableism - adults oppressing children, people without mental health issues oppressing people who do. The two main issues I've outlined, both relating to child psychiatry, are the tip of the iceberg, and primarily concern children of Western, white descent, as those tend to be the types of people who seek out psychiatric treatment at a young age. 

I only hope that the discussion enlightens a lot of you to the systematic abuse children face in our Western society.

I'm not going to go into too much detail since my research isn't published yet and I'd also rather not be identifiable, but the project I'm working on involves examining the skeletal remains of some Hopewell individuals from the Midwestern United States (roughly 2000 years old) with some pretty significant pathologies. It should be noted that the particular group I'm studying does not have any descendant communities.

I'm scheduled to present my research publicly this month, and the nature of the project is such that adequately presenting the data to an audience of mixed professions necessitates accompanying photography of the pathologies. It was recently brought to my attention that there were indigenous people within my department who would be deeply offended were I, a white person, to present in public the remains of an indigenous person, something that hadn't crossed my privileged mind. I absolutely do not want to ignore them, especially given the historical tendency of my field to exploit and/or ignore indigenous peoples, and I am already planning to pull the photographs from my presentation in favor of photographs/diagrams from medical literature. That said, the clarity of the presentation will inevitably suffer and I'm still left with several questions. I feel like you all might have some good insight.

What is the role of white researchers in the study of ancient indigenous groups with no descendant communities? Is there one at all?

Is merely replacing the original photographs with similar, non-indigenous photographs an acceptable middle ground if ultimately my project still necessitates a white person studying the body of an indigenous person?

Can the rights and desires of indigenous peoples be reconciled with researchers' desires for clarity or ""objectivity"" (I'm aware of the baggage that goes along with this word).

Should research such as mine be done at all if it hinges on such problematic sources of data and is inevitably done through Western institutions?

This might also be a good jumping-off point to talk about [NAGPRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_Graves_Protection_and_Repatriation_Act) or other related legislation.

However, I thought this was the sort of event that might be of particular interest to SRSDiscussion: Not just the initial event itself, but the general aftermath and discussions that are going on.

For some context, Brazilian Jiu jitsu is a full contact, grappling martial art. It's basically about pinning someone to the ground and then forcing them to submit with chokes or joint locks. Think wrestling, but you're encouraged to try to break bits off your opponent. It has become wildly popular in the US, and is a big part of mixed martial arts (cage fighting), because BJJ practitioners have been very successful in mixed martial arts.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu

Anyway, one of the more famous Brazilian Jiu Jitsu figures is Lloyd Irvin. He's a very well known black belt, and has started a very famous and commercially successful franchise of mixed martial arts (MMA) and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

On New Years Eve two of his (male) students assaulted and raped a (female) student. The case hasn't been finalised, but apparently the evidence is pretty damning - video, etc. MAJOR trigger warning:

http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/01/matthew-maldonado-nicholas-schultz-appear-in-court--83929.html

This was a particularly big deal, not just because they were all students of his, but at least one of the two perpetrators is seen as a rising star in BJJ.

The story then escalated, when it emerged that Lloyd Irvin had been involved (but found not guilty on technical grounds) in a university gang rape case in 1999. Another serious trigger warning:

http://articles.dailypress.com/1990-04-25/news/9004250070_1_third-juror-irvin-trial

The response from the BJJ community has been pretty unanimous disgust, with major affiliates of the Lloyd Irvin school dropping them like a hot brick. There has been some horrible victim blaming along the way, but there's been a lot of leading lights coming out, with videos, open letters and so on, and a fair amount of soul searching from some people. Here are some links:

However, what I was not expecting was the complete glossing over and lack of acceptance of the flip side of the coin: the marginalization of overly skinny people. My problem is this: if we are to accept one body type that falls out of the ordinary as legitimate, then we need to accept the other extreme as well.

My issue is that when I see a mannequin such as the one discussed in the thread there, and see people acting like that body type (highly skinny) is gross and one that shouldn't be pursued (because it is dangerous, etc.) I begin to see alot of the same jargon and rhetoric reproduced that is used in fat-shaming (""It's unhealthy"", ""you look like an X"", etc.). Although I agree that we shouldn't be forcing all people to conform to the standards of super-skinny, like some mannequins and other cultural values do, we also shouldn't say that that skinniness is undesirable and wrong, like many of the comments I saw there.

In this thread, one specific quote I saw mocked really got to me. Listed along with a bunch of other fat-shaming posts and things that are definitely SRS-Worthy, the effort-post contains this:
&gt;So typical. Society claims it wants to help people with body image issues, then goes and acts disgusted about skinny bodies. As a skinny person, I'm sick of this double standard. 

Although some of the rhetoric used in this quote is slightly shitty, the general idea is true. As someone who has suffered body image issues for most of my life, mostly due to being highly skinny, often at the point of having ribs showing, etc, it's really shitty to hear that my issues and the subsequent problems that went with them don't matter because they weren't ""the right"" body image issues. In a patriarchal culture like the one we live in, it's very hard for a male to be highly skinny, as they're not seen as contributing to typical cultural standards of masculinity, the stereotypical buff ""manly man"". (Not trying to seem all whatabouthemenz here, but as a male myself I definitely get this alot). Women also suffer from this, as those who don't fit within the idealistic model are told to ""go eat a candy bar"" or have other such body-shaming language used against them (twig, etc.)

My problem is simply when a community claims to be as inclusive as SRS, then shames and marginalizes one group like in this case, there's definitely some internal contradictions. I hope we can take steps together to realize that the problem is with both fat-shaming and ""skinny-shaming"", and realize that both of those two are simply side-by-side contributors to the same culture of toxic body-shaming that exists in our society.

Thanks, and if I said anything shitty here, please pointin it out (as I am still a baby SRSer).




EDIT: None of this is talking about the shaming (which probably don't real) of people with bodies that are considered ""normal"" (like any body type is normal) or ""fit"" (like size is a good indicator of health) skinny, but those who are treated by our society as being ""too"" skinny, etc.


EDIT2: Hey everyone. My point isn't that it's a worse problem or even as bad.

I understand the concept that if a specific group calls a certain 'thing' off limits, or sacred, we should listen and respect that, but then I thought about how ... prevalent it is, and where the line is drawn.

Is it when it is used for profit and not personal use? When does it cross the line from appreciation to problematic? Tattoos that use symbols from other cultures, tourist souvenirs, fashion ...

It's hard for me to press the conversation, since as someone who has been bullied myself, I empathize with the pain they are feeling and don't want to make them feel like I'm discounting their bad experiences. On the other hand, I'm a woman and was bullied about my weight and appearance. However, I always ran from bullies, so I was lucky enough to avoid physical abuse, besides a couple situations. Sometimes privileged people are bullied over silly things because children can be cruel.

1344132282.0,31,self.SRSDiscussion,xp3i4,"Race and Language in ""Authority and American Usage"" by David Foster Wallace",,39,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/xp3i4/race_and_language_in_authority_and_american_usage/,"I'm a huge fan of David Foster Wallace. One of my favourite nonfiction pieces of his is ""Authority and American Usage"" (originally published in Harper's as ""Tense Present""); ostensibly a review of a Bryan A. Garner's *A Dictionary of Modern American Usage*, it's mostly a discussion on the relationships between language, culture, politics, and society. The essay is a great read, and if you want you can check it out [here](http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/DFW_present_tense.html). However, I'm mostly interesting in responses to one section where Wallace (who taught college English) discusses ""a spiel [he gave] in private conference with certain black students who were (a) bright and inquisitive and (b) deficient in what U.S. higher education considers written English facility"".

As a white person, the first time I read the article I felt that it was excellent and on point and ""telling it how it is"" and so forth. As I've become more knowledgeable about racial issues, I'm less sure about this (moreover, I'm less confident in my ability to judge such things), so I'd be interested to see how you folks feel about it.

The ""spiel"" is as follows (note that ""SBE"" stands for ""Standard Black English"", which is how Wallace refers to the class of English dialects spoken primarily by black Americans):
&gt;I don't know whether anybody's told you this or not, but when you're in a college English class you're basically studying a foreign dialect. This dialect is called Standard Written English. From talking with you and reading your essays, I've concluded that your own primary dialect is [one of three variants of SBE common to our region]. Now, let me spell something out in my official Teacher-voice: The SBE you're fluent in is different from SWE in all kinds of important ways. Some of these differences are grammatical — for example, double negatives are OK in Standard Black English but not in SWE, and SBE and SWE conjugate certain verbs in totally different ways. Other differences have more to do with style — for instance, Standard Written English tends to use a lot more subordinate clauses in the early parts of sentences, and it sets off most of these early subordinates with commas, and, under SWE rules, writing that doesn't do this is ""choppy."" There are tons of differences like that. How much of this stuff do you already know? [STANDARD RESPONSE: some variation on ""I know from the grades and comments on my papers that English profs don't think I'm a good writer.""] Well, I've got good news and bad news. There are some otherwise smart English profs who aren't very aware that there are real dialects of English other than SWE, so when they're reading your papers they'll put, like, ""Incorrect conjugation"" or ""Comma needed"" instead of ""SWE conjugates this verb differently"" or ""SWE calls for a comma here."" That's the good news — it's not that you're a bad writer, it's that you haven't learned the special rules of the dialect they want you to write in. Maybe that's not such good news, that they were grading you down for mistakes in a foreign language you didn't even know was a foreign language. That they won't let you write in SBE. Maybe it seems unfair. If it does, you're not going to like this news: I'm not going to let you write in SBE either. In my class, you have to learn and write in SWE. If you want to study your own dialect and its rules and history and how it's different from SWE, fine — there are some great books by scholars of Black English, and I'll help you find some and talk about them with you if you want. But that will be outside class. In class — in my English class — you will have to master and write in Standard Written English, which we might just as well call ""Standard White English,"" because it was developed by white people and is used by white people, especially educated, powerful white people. [RESPONSES by this point vary too widely to standardize.] I'm respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is the straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the dialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige, and anybody of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender who wants to succeed in American culture has got to be able to use SWE. This is How It Is. You can be glad about it or sad about it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's racist and unjust and decide right here and now to spend every waking minute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you should, but I'll tell you something: If you ever want those arguments to get listened to and taken seriously, you're going to have to communicate them in SWE, because SWE is the dialect our country uses to talk to itself. African Americans who've become successful and important in U.S. culture know this; that's why King's and X's and Jackson's speeches are in SWE, and why Morrison's and Angelou's and Baldwin's and Wideman's and West's books are full of totally ass-kicking SWE, and why black judges and politicians and journalists and doctors and teachers communicate professionally in SWE. Some of these people grew up in homes and communities where SWE was the native dialect, and these black people had it much easier in school, but the ones who didn't grow up with SWE realized at some point that they had to learn it and become able to write in it, and so they did.

To begin with, I'm compelled to say that in no way is this intended to be a Shitlord Apologist post.  I'm interested in discussing Personality Disorders and ableism.  Where should the line be drawn?

As some quick background information, I'm currently working as support staff for a company that houses clients with various mental conditions.  The vast majority (99%+) of these clients receive money from Social Security because they are unable to care for themselves due to their disorders.  A good chunk of the clients have also spent time in rehab/the penal system.  HIPAA prevents me from discussing these clients in any great detail, so please forgive me for speaking in generalities.

Some of the most difficult clients I've had to work with have been diagnosed as children with Conduct Disorder, and in coming into adulthood, Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.  Different clients are medicated to different degrees, but for the most part, most of them are on medications designed to assuage their aggression.  Therapy for the most part does not work.

While the clients are not physically violent towards me, they often say extremely hateful things.  Things orders of magnitude worse than the Average Redditor.  I have been instructed to cue the clients when they speak out in offensive ways, but have been forbidden from lecturing them about *why* their words are hurtful.  Basically, the company views this sort of intervention as a lost cause.

Unfortunately, I'm having some difficulty dealing with this.  My mind has been going in circles over and over again.

I feel like if I try to hold the clients accountable for their words, I may be acting in an ableist manner.  Simply because their conditions prevent them from (as far as I know) from seeing the world in a different way.  It would be like me getting angry at a person with crutches for taking too long to cross the crosswalk in front of me on my way to school.  I don't believe that a person loses their rights when they become a bigot.

But at the same time, some of the things that come out of their mouths is just awful and very offensive to me. The optimist in me wants to scream ""this isn't the person talking, this is their disorder!"" but the pessimist makes me wonder how much control they really do have. My main questions are:

1.  At what point do you stop holding people accountable (socially) for things they say or do?

2.  How can I reconcile that their disorders are responsible for what they're doing?  

3.  If a client's actions are the primary diagnostic criteria for their personality disorder, is it *really* reasonable for me to say that their disorders are at fault (if y meets the criteria for x, then x causes y)?  It doesn't feel right.

4.  Maybe this is just a result of my experiences, but is it really appropriate to hastily generalize somebody as being a Shitlord when I don't know the underlying medical reasons behind it?  For all I know, the person on reddit spewing vitriol may have a personality disorder that I'm unaware of.

I don't want to be an ableist by accident, but at the same time, I don't want bigots to roam free unchecked.  I want to be able to help people who need help while still remaining optimistic about the future.  My head is stuck and I don't know what to think.  Help me SRSD!

So my friend and I have been talking about his confusion with his sexual orientation for a long time, and after many months of nuanced discussion he has realized definitively that he is heteroromantic and homosexual. I've only ever seen the romantic orientation labels applied to people who are asexual, so this is new and uncharted territory for me. 

His love life has been and is a complete wreck. He attaches to women emotionally/relationship wise, but is exclusively attracted to men, sexually. My friend has hit the emotional/romantic self-destruct button, dating women he rarely/never has intimate encounters with (which both partners find unsatisfying), and then hooking up with their male roommates behind their back(with no interest in any romantic elements). Now that we've talked about it and are out of self-destruct mode, he wants to know about ""what he is"" and what he's ""supposed to do."" 

Obviously those questions are a bit reductive, but my friend is at a loss and I'm at a loss of how to help him understand his identity and where he goes from here. 

What are your thoughts and experiences with ""conflicting"" romantic &amp; sexual orientations SRSD? Any thoughts, academic, anecdotal or otherwise for me to help my friend? 

Edit: Additional potentially relevant details: He is a cismale in his mid twenties, and has felt this way his whole life just always been confused and never ""come to terms with it."" He had most sexual encounters (and all sexually-satisfying encounters) from pre-teen to present with boys/men, but has always only had ""dating"" and ""emotional/romantic"" connections with women.

Just an ignorant shitlord here trying to learn. I hope this is the right place to discuss this.

I know that there's a rape culture, but how come many (if not most) users here don't believe in the existence of a ""violence culture""? Media like movies and games normalize and even trivialize the act of killing, desensitizing people to the horrors of violence. No one gives a thought to some random mook getting shot in a FPS, and people who kill are glorified and seen as heroes in action films, which paint the act of killing as something positive or ""cool"". 

I know that there isn't just a correlation between viewing violence and committing violence (same as how telling an awful rape joke doesn't directly lead to rape), but just the constant exposure to violence as seen through a positive light normalizes this crime and shields people from its true nature. 

Rape culture and what I call a ""violence culture"" are obviously fundamentally different and require different solutions, but the fact that some people here deny ""violence culture's"" existence just seems... insensitive? Especially since violence is an issue deeply connected to the subjugation of minorities.

Sorry if I made a mistake in posting this here.

**Edit**: You guys are awesome! Thanks for the intelligent input that I otherwise wouldn't have known. Part of the reason I made this post was an observation of how violence is rather commonplace in my society and how different it's received in others. Admittedly, my argument on how media normalized violence was sort of a devil's advocate on it's effects (there's a ton of evidence to suggest that stuff like violent videogames don't lead to violence, and I consume violent media almost daily).

I have heard many people use the phrase ""xxxxxxxx makes me want to kill myself"" as an expression of frustration.  I have personally said it a few times, too (usually something along the lines of ""Reading any front page comment thread on Reddit makes me want to kill myself!"", or something equally silly).  Until yesterday, I had never considered the fact that this saying might be triggering for some people.  

On one hand, I definitely see how this phrase could be a trigger.  It could bring up traumatic experiences in people's pasts or just generally make them feel shitty or undermined.  On the other hand, where is the line drawn?  People could have had experiences with any number of things in their past, and nobody can be expected to tip-toe around any *potentially* triggering thing.  

I see the issue from both sides and from now on will try to make an effort not to use this particular phrase, especially since it is pretty nonsensical phrase anyway.

My ask has some background. First consider this (NSFW/TW) Don't Flop battle feat [Lunar C &amp; Matter vs Eddie P &amp; Frisko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtBUnpaWfRw) in which they say all kinds of outlandish, misogynistic shit in the course of their ""art"". You may note that devoid of disability, familial and SO disses, there's little else going on! Note also that there's very few women around in the audience.  In the context of Salman Rushdie's famous [Is Nothing Sacred?](http://www.beartronics.com/rushdie.html) essay from 1990, he argues for a privileged art space (in his case, he's only arguing for literature and specifically novels, but you get the point) where the sacred should not hold sway, and censure should not fall on those who offend the sacred.  With little extrapolation, we can substitute all kinds  of identity offence into the thought experiment in place of blasphemy.

Are there any safe public spaces for potentially offensive communication? What if everyone there knows what they are ""signing up for"" and pre-emptively agrees to take it in good humour?

Continuing with the hip hop theme, remember Eminem's 2000 [The Real Slim Shady](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJO5HU_7_1w), where he famously argued:

&gt;I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room. 
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all 
and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all

I frequently find myself saying some pretty horrific violent stuff at the telly - usually when confronted by the worst excesses of reality cringe, or public figures saying things I disagree with.  Clearly I would never ""glass the big brother winner"" or ""smack david cameron in the face"".  Occasionally when witnessed by others, they can get pretty shocked - especially if they know me, because there's zero chance I would ever do these things if given the opportunity. Eminem's point (well made) is that we all have the capacity and propensity for hateful communication, but that we largely do it in private.  Furthermore, to only do it in private is hypocrisy and cowardice, and we should at least have the courage of our convictions and say it publicly.

But then, when such ad hominem insults are publicised, they clearly become intimidation or hate speech, because the public audience, in contrast with the private audience in my home, do not know me well enough to know that this is hyperbolic venting with no intent to act. There's also the risk that my venomous diatribe might convince some unstrung beau to act in my words in the mistaken belief this is my desire.

For example, the Conservative MP Louise Mensch made a [widely derided appearance on Newsnight](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01h7mqm/Newsnight_02_05_2012/) (BBC) yesterday but was overnight subjected to a huge array of Twitterers slinging gendered slurs at her. She responded bravely, but that's got to be scary.  And lest we think that ""typeface is cheap"", we all remember [Gabrielle Giffords](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/8248267/American-congresswoman-Gabrielle-Giffords-shot-in-head.html).

So, the questions:
* Are there art forms (like battle hip hop) where normal rules about what is ""beyond the pale"" should be suspended?
* Is it acceptable to articulate sentiments in circumscribed company that would clearly be offensive in public earshot?
* Is it hypocritical? Should one be willing to say before the world that which one would whisper to the wife? 
*(alliteration was the impetus rather than gender normative precepts here!)*

Additional thoughts
* Is there a material difference between saying something and posting it, or is it just there's a record?
* Does one's responsibility to articulate acceptable, respectful, measured opinions grow with the size of one's following?

Thanks y'all

The other camp points out that such open admiration constitutes homosexuality, reminding us all of the stigma associated with homosexuality.
___
Therefore, RPG may be seen as an early indication of more widespread understanding of homosexuality as non-deviant. If Redditors are stating that they could feasibly understand being attracted to the same sex, and do not see such as a significant problem, this may be positive.

On the otherhand, RPG may be seen as society openly acknowledging the inferior status of homosexuals. When a Redditor proclaims that he would ""even go gay"" for RPG, he is bringing to his statement the implied notion that he is willing to accept and subject himself to the stigma of homosexuality. The **gravity** of such statement is leveraged to evidence *how badly* the Redditor is attracted to RPG.

Personally, I am tending to lean towards the second proposition. RPG may not be a herald for acceptance of a sexual orientation, instead a big joke premised on the acknowledgement &amp; perpetuation of homosexual inferiority. I am, however, undecided. Thoughts? :)

If you have been on Twitter or Facebook you have probably seen some post, link, or picture that has Kony2012 in it. On twitter right now there are 3 trending topics that concern this tag. Joseph Kony is the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda who has the goal of creating a theocratic government based on the Ten Commandments. You can look at the linked Wikipedia arguments for more information on the man and the group. This post isn’t meant to be another in a long line of responses decrying his use of child soldiers or the killing of civilians but to put Kony, LRA, and the campaign to take him out (led by Obama militarily and Invisible Children socially) into its proper context.


President Obama on October 15th last year, a few days before Mummar Qaddafi was killed in Sirte, Libya, told America and the world that it was going to send 100 US soldiers and advisers to Uganda to help fight Kony and the LRA. This act was seen along with the Libya intervention as the first real push for humanitarian military intervention since the Clinton era. Along with that announcement within a few days he also authorized military action in the Central African Republic, Congo, Kenya,and Somalia, for similar stated reasons.

5 months later and we see Invisible Children, an organization dedicated to child solider advocacy, launch a campaign against the same people Obama sent in the military to fight. They posted this page with a petition, and this video to drum up support for the cause of taking out/arresting Kony. Over the past few day this video and the attached cause has become viral and has now infected every Twitter and FB feed on the internet.

What issue can one have with this campaign or the people behind it? A lot actually. Now before I write anything else I want to let all of you know that I as much as anyone else wants to do somethings to Kony and the LRA for the abuses they have wrought on the African people. With that said the people who are leading the crusade against him are as much part of the problem as the LRA is.

Let’s look at Obama and the US. He is going into Uganda to help crush this terrorist and evil man to help preserve the stability of the nation and that part of Africa. I question those motives based on past “humanitarian” interventions America has done and the context within which they have happened. There is alot of evidence (that would constitute a book within itself) that alot of what we call humanitarian interventions are nothing more than America flexing its muscles in places where the chaos can give it or its allies an upper hand. We seen it in Bosnia, Libya, Somalia, Haiti, and many other nations. There’s also the issue of launching this campaign right after the west had overthrown the only government in the northern half of Africa that has had a consistent anti-imperialist foreign policy (Libya) that would have resisted US incursions into the continent.

Invisible Children although not as organized in their profiteering as America when dealing with human crisis has a nice rap sheet of its own. According to many sources, including the Better Business Bureau, Invisible Children is not as open with it’s financials as it should be and base on many of its actions and statements supports military intervention into these situations. This blog post goes into much more detail about the issues with Invisible Children.

Now the reason why I mention all of this is not because I’m trying to debunk the organizations themselves but because they highlight the failed thinking that is still pervasive in westerns about world conflicts. There’s an undertone in the IC video and in the writings of those who are supporters of Kony2012 that if we don’t do something that this will never stop. It’s a very typical “white man’s burden” mindset on the world. Most of us look out into the world and see the issues of Uganda, the rest of Africa, and other poor parts of the world and see them as either savages that need to be taught to act decent or as poor souls who are victims of some vague evil of life. Both of these points of view and the idea that we somehow in America and Europe have the right and responsibility to represent the child soldiers and people of these places is a serious problem for me. It continues the paternalistic attitude that enables America and the west to intervene into places which in more cases than not are a result of previous actions by the same nations that are coming to “save” it.

The WMB mentality also covers up not only closeted forms of american exceptionalism and racism, it also covers up the imperialistic roots of these conflicts. Before the west enslaved and kidnapped millions of Africans and stripped the continent of it’s resources, religious fanaticism like we see here was not prevalent. Nor was starvation, or war, or poverty, or even AIDS. All of these (at least at the levels they are today) are a result of European colonialism. By making the story of some crazed religious fanatic that we should hate it distracts from the Ugandan dictatorship which is a major cause of much of the suffering of the people there and the US government who has supported the regime for over 20 years. It also hides the desperation due to neo-colonial destruction of Africa’s economy that has pushed people to join organizations like the LRA. All of this is hidden if we focus all the attention on making Kony “famous”.

What are we to do then? How do we advocate for the child soldiers, innocent civilians, and others affected by these conflicts? Well for starters we should ask the people of Uganda and African what they want. I can’t say I have seen any sources that give a wide point of view on the conflict and what the people are feeling about it and the US intervention into it but if anyone does please link it in the comments. I would also say if there is going to be intervention into the conflict that it ought to at least come from the African Union not from the US, EU, or UN. None of these institutions have the right to dictate to these people or anybody for that fact how they should deal with their problems. We can give moral support but most military interventions that aim to bring peace end in new dictators and criminals or they end with mass civilian deaths due to the intervention (Iraq and Afghanistan are examples of both results). When we see these campaigns against some “evil” person in some other nation let’s be careful to put that person, their organizations, and the conflict into their proper contexts. Without doing so we are no better than the generations before us who allowed imperialism to gain a hold over the world in the name of first God, then civilization, then freedom, and today democracy and wet it’s wheels with the blood of humanity.

As an aside, it stands to note that this whole campaign may be irreverent based on the fact that Kony hasn’t been active in Uganda since 2006. So America sending troops over there can’t be to help win the conflict because it doesn’t exist there anymore. The statement was made in the Huff Post article about US sending troops to Uganda that “The U.S. doesn’t have to fight al-Qaida-linked Shabab in Somalia, so we help Uganda take care of their domestic security problems, freeing them up to fight a more dangerous – or a more pressing, perhaps – issue in Somalia. I don’t know if we would necessarily say that but it’s surely a plausible theory…” Just something else to think about…

""Socially constructed"" is a phrase that comes up in the Fempire a lot, often with regards to gender, but I feel that it often causes confusion due to a lack of mutual agreement about what the term means. I'm not trying to say what the 'real' definition of a social construction is, just to point out that there are at least three propositions that people may be making when they use that term, each of which has its own implications. And, whether one intends one meaning rather than the other can fundamentally change the terms of a discussion.

So, I hope you will indulge me while I take you on a pleasure cruise through the murky waters of sociological* theory:

PHENOMENOLOGY &amp; KNOWLEDGE

The idea that some things are ""social constructs"" originates in philosophy and early sociology, especially the works of Edmund [Husserl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husserl) (1859-1938), who founded [phenomenology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_\(philosophy\)), and early sociologist Max [Weber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_weber) (1864-1920).

In brief, Husserl was dissatisfied with the [dominant scientific and philosophical assumption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) that humans' perceptions of reality were direct reflections of objective reality. Instead, he argued that the congruence between [subjective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity) perception and a 'true' [objective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_\(philosophy\)) reality was essentially impossible to ascertain, as subjective experience is our only way of getting at objective reality. Since direct apprehension of objective reality is outside of our capabilities, he turned his attention instead to the more practical issue of how humans relate to an external world that they *assume* is real and natural.

Meanwhile, Weber (1864-1920) was trying to systematize sociology as a discipline, including establishing its basic philosophical premises. Just as Husserl was concerned with objectivity and subjectivity with regards to the natural and physical sciences, Weber found himself juggling the matter of objectivity and subjectivity as they relate to the *social* sciences. He concluded that objective knowledge of ""cultural reality"" is impossible, because cultural knowledge ""is always knowledge from particular points of view"".

KNOWLEDGE THROUGH INTERACTION

Alfred [Schutz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sch%C3%BCtz) (1899-1959) then took the works of Husserl and Weber and synthesized them into a general model of knowledge and social interaction that regarded knowledge as something [intersubjective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#In_philosophy) and generated through mutual agreement. That is, even if humans can never prove once-and-for-all that an objective physical reality exists, we at least have social processes by which we come to agree that it does exist and act on that agreement. In short, *all* knowledge is - at best - intersubjective, not objective.

Schutz's collaborator, Thomas [Luckmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Luckmann) (1927-), and his pal Peter [Berger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Berger) (1929-) expanded that basic premise into a general theory of knowledge, asserting that our reliance on intersubjectivity to attach meanings to objective phenomena means that the ""[reality of everyday life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality)"" (in contrast to other 'realities' like those of dreams, fantasies, or alternate universes) is only possible through processes of socialization. According to this perspective, reality - as far as it is perceptible to us, that is, intersubjectively - is a social construct. That doesn't mean reality isn't ""real"" or that there is no objective reality, just that the reality experienced by humans is, by its nature, the product of interactions that allow us to give things meaning. In this sense, even something as seemingly objective as time is a social construct because it only means something within social context, that is, to the extent that we give it a name, measure it in a particular way, and integrate it into our social lives in an agreed upon fashion. Likewise with all other aspects of everyday reality.

FIRST MEANING:

And this leads me (finally!) to the first meaning of social constructionism: it is the proposition that since all aspects of reality are perceptible only through subjectivity, knowledge can be generated only in an intersubjective fashion (through agreement), and therefore all reality is socially constructed. This is an [epistemological](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) statement, though, not an [ontological](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) one! Berger and Luckmann weren't making an argument about what does and doesn't exist, just how humans know what they know.

BUT...

As social constructionism picked up as a sort of uniting paradigm within sociology, more and more attention was cast not only on the role of interaction in generating intersubjective definitions of (a presumed) objective reality, but also its ability to generate intersubjective definitions that do *not* necessarily correspond to something that exists objectively. Two sociologists, [W.I. Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.I._Thomas) (1863-1947) and D.S. Thomas (1899-1977), made the observation that ""If men [sic] [define situations as real](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_theorem), they are real in their consequences."" It is essentially a statement that something doesn't *have* to be objectively real in order to have real consequences -- people just have to act on it *as though* it is real. Biological race is a classic example: if a society defines race as something that exists and matters, race will no doubt have real consequences regardless of whether or not it actually corresponds to objective reality.

SECOND MEANING

Based on the Thomas theorem, this is the second meaning that social constructionism can take: it is the proposition that something that is not necessarily objectively real can nevertheless have real consequences because people intersubjectively agree that it exists and act on that agreement. Unlike the first definition, there is an ontological component. However, not everything that is socially constructed in this sense is being asserted as 'not real' - the point is, whether or not it is real, people's belief that it is is sufficient to have measurable consequences.

So, when somebody says something like ""race/gender/time is a social construct,"" there are at least two different ways you can interpret that from a sociological perspective:

1) that our *knowledge* of what race, gender, or time is exists only within a social context of intersubjective meanings

2) that race, gender, or time have *consequences* on social life that result from beliefs that people have about it (independent of whatever objective existence they do or do not have)

AND FINALLY

There is a third meaning that doesn't fit particularly well within the sociological usage I've painstakingly outlined, but which I think is very common in everyday usage:

3) the proposition that something (race/gender/time) is itself objectively *unreal* but has consequences on social life that result from beliefs that people have about it.

WHY DOES IT MATTER IF PEOPLE INTERCHANGE THESE MEANINGS?

Depending on which meaning you intend, saying that something is a social construct has implications for whether or not you believe the ""thing"" in question exists objectively or was ""made up"" by society. This can have pretty big implications for the terms of a discussion and I think it is most often problematic in discussing issues of gender. To some people, saying that gender is a social construct is shorthand for ""gender only exists because society says it does"" (#3) whereas for others it means that ""all knowledge of gender is the result of social interaction"" (#1) or that ""the idea of gender affects people's lives regardless of whether or not it is a biological reality"" (#2). It should go without saying that meaning #3 can be especially problematic in a lot of contexts, especially gender, because it involves an objective claim that something very deeply felt and experienced doesn't exist.

So, keep on talking about how things are socially constructed, but consider making it explicit in your statements what you mean when you use that term.

*My knowledge is almost solely from a sociological perspective, I can't speak to how other disciplines have adapted the concept.  I welcome feedback from any and all perspectives!

I can't justify reading Reddit if the ad revenue I provide facilitates the trading of child porn. That's not something I want to be a part of and there are other ways to access the benefits Reddit provides without facilitating child porn. That said, I really like some aspects of Reddit and I want to keep using it so I need a way to ease my conscience.

I think the best thing we can do is educate Reddit. We need to report abuses and follow up with the mods and admin to make sure they have actually addressed the issue. When they don't, we need to publicize it. We also can't just target subreddits. We need to target the individual users who contribute to those subreddits, especially when those contributions are obviously explicit and illegal. Those users need to be not just banned, but reported to the authorities with the full cooperation of the Reddit administration. A change in policy only matters insofar as it is enforced. This policy should be vigorously enforced. But it will only be enforced if we hold the Reddit administration accountable.

There's a conversation to be had about the illegalization of child porn, freedom of speech, etc. The place for that conversation is not Reddit. Neutral third parties are more than welcome to debate those issues but the people who benefit from child porn are not the ones who should be setting the terms of that conversation. Reddit benefits financially from the facilitation of child pornography and, as such, cannot but be interested in continuing such facilitation. Given Reddit's inability to articulate an unbiased position on child pornography and the highly questionable nature of child pornography itself, we should err on the side of caution.

I'd like to take a moment to look at the excuses listed in SRS's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/o0pdv/meta_srs_faq/) (under the ""Doesn't all the hate towards white, straight men make SRS just as bigoted?"" question). Below is my own deconstruction of excuses, but I'm interested in hearing your insights as well!


* Free Speech!  

 Calling someone out for a harmful comment has nothing to do with censorship. In fact, it's the opposite of censorship; it's the free exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions. It's hard to think of a more twisted way get ""whiners"" off of your back than to tell people offended by your remark that their reaction is impeding on your first amendment right when most of those people  belong to groups that *actually* had to fight for rights to free speech and control of their own lives. That's what makes the jokes offensive in the first place.. they're playing off of real attitudes left over from an era of legalized oppression against certain groups and belittling their continued struggle to shake off stereotypes and discrimination.  

 * Just a joke!

 There are several arguments to be made here. One is that jokes lose their edge when repeated 100 times a day. Generally, anyone with a modicum of good taste when it comes to comedy finds jokes that have been told to death boring as hell. If it's not somewhat original, or a least a re-tweeking, wtf is the point of making it? 

 Another is awareness for your audience. Would you tell an African-American coworker a KFC joke to their face? No? Then why here? Oh, because ""it's the internet."" Well, can you at least take responsibility for alienating a group of people and admit that you're ruining reddit's chance of being a diverse, dynamic place instead of an echo-chamber? That *that's* the kind of thing you want for reddit? I see, I should shut up and get tougher skin. What a shitlord.  

 One thing people love to say while using this excuse is, ""I'm not actually rascist/sexist/transphobic, I'm making the joke ironically."" There is a massive difference between humor that makes fun of damaging ideas by targeting the bigoted personalities that perpetuate those ideas vs targeting the people that have been damaged by them. If you're not actually a prejudiced fuckwit, you wouldn't make jokes that *reinforce the position taken by actual bigots.* 

 * White man discrimination!

 Alright. Every group has issues they feel need fixing. We could argue the legitimacy of some of those issues all day, but the bottom line is: your issues *do. not. negate. anyone. else's.* When one group flat out denies or ignores forms of discrimination faced by another group and takes every opportunity to derail that group's concerns by changing the context to fit their own agenda, it drastically lessens the validity of whatever points the original group may have had.

A member of a group I work with recently shared this link: http://barreloforanges.com/2013/06/29/silencing-male-victims-of-genital-mutilation/.

It is a link talking about male circumcision and how men are often silenced if they question it or stand in opposition. It brings up a lot of discussion around infants and bodily autonomy that I supposed I have a stance on, but feel conflicted about.

My first issue with the article, and some of the discussions I have heard from such activists, is that the rhetoric sounds a lot like the kind of stuff I would hear from men's rights activists (like, ""what about the men?""). I agree that male circumcision doesn't receive as much attention as female circumcision but I kinda feel like that is for a reason. The physical impacts don't seem as terrible for male bodies as they do for female bodies and on top of that, female bodies are often circumcised in an act of control and oppression. I don't necessarily see how that can be argued for male circumcision. Regardless, I just really have a problem with the idea that we need to set up male circumcision in opposition to or in competition with women's rights.

Second, I am not Jewish but I have had friends and acquaintances get really offended at this type of activism because of the link between circumcision and religious practices. I think it is important to acknowledge this. Of course, there are also Jewish folks who are strongly in opposition to the practice, further complicating issues. Then I also think about Islam and female circumcision and I feel like it is much harder for me to acknowledge the cultural implications because again, I feel that the physical complications are much much worse and because of the links to control and domination over women. But at the same time, I don't want to be Islamophobic and have it in my head that Islamic practices are inherently oppressive. I am sure there are Muslim women out there who may feel empowered by their circumcision and who am I to tell them they're wrong?

Lastly, the whole discussion ignores trans bodies and queer identities. I am mostly cisgendered so I do not know exactly what an appropriate discussion would look like in this situation but it's something that comes to my awareness.

What are people's thoughts and opinions?

So there are folks in my social group who think that Pick Up Artists (in the vein of Mystery and The Game) have some merit, and that it's good advice. I'm aware of the many flaws and problematic views on gender in the PUA community, but I'm not the most persuasive speaker. Here's what I got so far:

1.) Pick-Up Artists largely focus on a woman's physical appearance, and the advice does not help in regards to finding women who would be ""right"" for you.

2.) It has an adversarial approach to women. Terms like ""anti-slut defense"" and ""bitch shield"" set up women as opponents to defeat, instead of focusing on building camaraderie and companionship.

3.) Its views on consent are problematic at best, dangerous at worst. It teaches that a woman will make her refusal to sexual advances overt. As in ""you're doing something wrong if she's shouting 'no!' at you."" When women express mild discomfort, PUA tactics tell you to try again in 5-20 minutes. This makes the man come off as the type of guy who won't take ""no"" for an answer, and some women might freeze up or 'go along' with things in fear of more violent alternatives.

1370276330.0,34,self.SRSDiscussion,1fl6j4,Do the ideas behind SRS subreddits demonstrate a fundamental distrust of the democratic process?,Daedalus18,62,28,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1fl6j4/do_the_ideas_behind_srs_subreddits_demonstrate_a/,"I am very sympathetic to srs, and the other subs in the 'fempire'.  There are a lot of fucked up things that people say on the internet, and in general life, that should be examined, challenged and even ridiculed.  I honestly think that reddit is probably a better place because of srs, since, in some ways, it forces people to be aware of, and accountable for, their own racism/sexism/ignorance.

However, I sometimes hear people associated with srs subs denouncing all of reddit, and the voting process itself, suggesting that the democratic selection of 'upvoting' inevitably generates shitty (politically/morally questionable) content.  Such posters often believe that stronger 'modding' - wherein a central authority monitors/censors content - would make reddit a better place.  Perhaps they are right, and mods often do very good work in this regard.  But I also think that mods can easily overstep their bounds, restricting the free course of discussion and strangling the open exchange of ideas. 

I see a strong parallel here with political governance.  The people whose voices are loudest (in places like pics or wtf) are akin to demagogues - dominating the discussion through ignorant platitudes.  Many casual reddit users (perhaps white, middle class, heterosexual, cisgender men) promote such offensive, noxious views.  Similarly, in society at large, most people don't check their privileges.  Many seem to overtly, subtly, or institutionally continue structures of oppression (patriarchy/classism/heteronormativity).  Compare this condition to the central questions of marxism, or political feminism, or black nationalism,: 'if most people are content/complacent/silent about living in a system with gross injustice, how can that injustice ever be stopped?  Through revolutionary application of force (a vanguard), or through gradual, democratic change, self-education and self-awareness?'

I suppose then my question is regarding the nature of srs itself.  Does it aim to 'destroy reddit from the inside', and replace it with a discursive structure that has more strict/discerning mods?  Or does it try to force/cajole redditors into being better, more considerate human beings (i.e., less shitty)?  Is this latter goal even possible? and if so, how?

In society as a whole, can open discussion surrounding the process of democratic election and governance (the ballot) create progressive political/ideological change, or can substantial changes only be achieved with the application of radical, top-down force (the mod/the bullet)?

1362854465.0,32,self.SRSDiscussion,19zc4w,Wondering what you all think about this essay posted to my FB wall regarding Anita Sarkeesian,city_lights,41,9,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/19zc4w/wondering_what_you_all_think_about_this_essay/,"So originally I thought about posting this in SRSGaming, but I think the core issues here are mostly regarding feminist theory rather than the games themselves.

So anyway: The long awaited first [Tropes vs Women in Video Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6p5AZp7r_Q) video came out a few days ago and I immediately posted it on my Facebook wall. I didn't think any of my FB friends actually cared that much but then this guy posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6gLmcS3-NI) as a comment just saying ""I'll just leave this here"". TL;DR - the narrator picks apart Sarkeesian's college thesis and some random videos of hers. My response is basically ""What does this have to do with negative stereotypes of women in video games? The video I posted is still completely valid"".

Then this morning I woke up to this:


&gt;Ok, having watched the vid, I must say there are a view misinterpretations in the games franchises she (Anita) cited, and with the topic in question (see: Mario series and Legend of Zelda series).

&gt;Pertaining to 'damsels in distress', in the same media there a several examples in which a male is imprisoned and unable to escape on their own, and need to be recused (see: Fire Emblem series, Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2, Metal Gear series, Dragon Age: Origins).

&gt;That being said, the question should be whether or not gender should be equated into it at all, since in both cases it's people who are captured against their will, and are unable to escape on their own accord, requiring assistance. The issue of gender should not factor into the equation at all, over the fact that an individual is in dire need of assistance.

&gt;In addition, if I may borrow some words, if taking gender into consideration: ""Modern Feminist theory is built on the foundations of patriarchy theory -- which includes such wonderful 'Truth' such as partriarchal terrorism, systemic gendered violence against women, and rape culture. Every single one of Anita's tropes assumes these to be true, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and therefore the damsel trope is seen as yet another man created idea to keep women down.

&gt;In reality, the trope is designed to show women's inherent value to society, not as objects, but as people. A male hero will literally go to hell and back and even die to rescue a damsel he sometimes doesn't even know. He does this not for a reward, but because it is ""right"". Justice and virtue are seen as sacrificing yourself and placing women above all. The villains, those worthy of death by the hands of the hero, are those commit the ultimate crime -- harming a woman.

&gt;Does this trope really seem like something crafted to oppress women? Or is it yet another example of women's historical indispensability and men's historical role of self-sacrifice and placing women's needs above their own?""

&gt;And while on the topic on video game, I think that there are some decent game with strong female characters (see: Perfect Dark, Mirror's Edge, Beyond Good and Evil, Metroid series, Resident Evil 2, 3, Code Veronica, and Revelations, No One Lives Forever 1 and 2, Portal 1 &amp; 2 (doubly so if you consider GlaDOS to be a female character), Oni, Final Fantasy 6) and that isn't *even* taking into consideration character inserts/swaps (See: BioWare game (Mass Effect, KOTOR, Jade Empire, Dragon Age), Pokemon).

&gt;Now, I think there's something to be said as far as the sexualization in certain games, but to a certain extent it comes down to what camp people fall regarding (for lack of a better phrase, currently) pro or anti-sex.

&gt;And separate from that topic itself is Anita and how she portrays her information and subject matter. As yet another example: http://www.destructoid.com/a-response-to-some-arguments-in-anita-sarkeesian-s-interview-230570.phtml

&gt;Sorry that I seem to be all over the place and haven't provided a lot of info, I'm tired and was trying to rush this out before I pass out. The tl;dr is this: Anita does a poor job at covering the topic, and I am not comfortable with *her* being the de facto face for it.

My gut reaction was ""Holy shit... is he an MRA?!"" because of the fourth paragraph which I interpreted as him saying that patriarchy, rape culture, etc aren't real. It also seems very ""but what about the menz"". It seems a lot like the comments in /r/MRA regarding the Sarkeesian video.

I have admittedly not studied many other theories of where oppression comes from. I did not even hear of intersectionality until I started browsing SRS.

Marxists argue that all forms of oppression can be traced back to conflict between the economic classes. The ruling class seeks to exploit the lower class(es) any way they can, and that is ultimately where all the different kinds of discrimination come from. The idea is that it is easier for the ruling class to extract economic profit from the masses when the masses are divided and weakened.

Racism, for example, largely came into play in the 1400s when Europeans ""discovered"" the Americas. They used racism as a justification for stealing American Indians' land, saying that they were ""savages"" that needed Europeans' ""assistance."" Racism was further perpetuated with the introduction of African slavery, which ONLY benefitted the white ruling class, not the white race as a whole. Slavery was actually harmful to white peasants because they could not get jobs on plantations and they could not compete with rich plantation owners.

Religion is most evidently a tool of the ruling class to dominate the lower classes. This was clear in the age of serfdom when serfs were forbidden from questioning their position in society. Questioning the system of serfdom was questioning god's plan. In religion we can also see where other forms of oppression come from, especially sexism and homophobia.

This is a brief and sloppy explanation of how Marxists interpret oppression, but hopefully you get the point.

This is how I interpret oppression because it makes sense to me. This theory also gives us a solution to ending oppression. If the source of all oppression lies in economic inequality, then it logically follows that eliminating inequality would eventually lead to the demise of racism and other forms of oppression. The lower classes must unite and seize the means of oppression and introduce ways of democratically controlling what the ruling class monopolizes now.

Some posters suggest that the idea that he wasn't actually gay means that it was somehow ""worse"" that he was bullied because of it, while I would suggest as a queer person it actually hurts a lot more to be bullied for something that is true and unchangeable. Regardless, it is unfortunately impossible to be sure how the people in these terrible situations actually identify themselves. Is it awful for the media to ignore the possibility that this young man may not have been gay? Is it just sensationalism, or is it allowable due to helping to show what the awful fact of homophobic bullying does to young people? Is it ever really okay to decide someone's sexuality for them based on the words and assumptions of others?

Please let me know if anything in this post is problematic, I know that suicide is a very sensitive issue and I don't want to seem insensitive or callous.

Drinks with a couple of coworkers (two dudes). We're talking about sex, as one does, and the conversation shifts to anal sex. None of us is a stranger to it. One of the dudes pipes up: ""I've only ever had anal sex twice, with an ex-girlfriend. I'm actually not surprised she agreed to it. She was a bit of a [slur].""

Of course, trying to remain calm (and, I confess, not wildly succeeding), I ask him, ""What makes her a [slur]?"" He hastens to explain to me that it's not the frequency with which she had sex, or the outrageousness of the sex acts she performed, but her low self-esteem.

Right, because anyone who would agree to a little buttfucking must have the LOWEST SELF-ESTEEM. Because women never enjoy anal sex as it's universally degrading. And a willingness to experiment sexually MUST be a sign that a woman deserves your disdain!

The worst part is that I actually hooked up with this guy (before these ridiculous comments, thank God) and thought he was smart/interesting. WRONG.

He later apologized for his hostility, but he did not apologize for the slut-shaming and the biotruths, and I do not think he ever will because he clearly doesn't get it.

Thank you all for your input. My other roommate and I discussed our concerns with him last night. We said that we could not reconcile his actions and it will lead to a toxic living environment. He will be moving out in two weeks. I told him if he had any questions or anything to say he should do so now as this will not be a continued discussion. He had none.

Our landlord was made aware of the situation and he is supportive of our decision. My good roommate very clearly addressed in no uncertain terms what he did. He had no response.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My roommate had sex with a woman a few nights ago. From the detailed story he proudly gave me, it sounds like he [raped](/trigger) her. My other roommate feels the same way and she wants him out. I have no idea what to do. I don't know how to succinctly include additional information relevant to what has happened. 

Here is a list:

* I have been here 1 month, same amount of time I've known my roommates
* I am not worried about my safety
* I have never seen his victim nor am I sure if contacting her is a good idea at all

I have NO clue what to do. My other roommate wants him gone, and I am in agreement. The logistics for initiating and seeing that process through are unknown to me.

That being said, I'm female and I have a small number of male friends who like to objectify and sexualize me for the lulz, and I have no idea how to respond without ""overreacting."" Most of my male friends do not do this, by the way. It's only a small handful.

Now, before anyone says I shouldn't be friends with these guys: they enjoy may of the same things as I do, we have great enjoyable interactions, and these comments are greatly in the minority. These guys just treat girls this way, and don't see why it's wrong. I think they would wise up right away if only I knew how to confront them correctly.

A small example from the other night: I picked up my cat. I do happen to have breasts that occupy space on my chest, so when I hold the cat the cat just so happens to be encountering my breasts, as that's the only way to comfortably hold a cat. My holding the cat was met with: **""Luckiest cat in the world!"" / ""Yeah, luckiest cat in the world!""** (My boyfriend was there and said nothing, though I'm sure he was uncomfortable.)

How does one respond to this in a way that a) gets the message across of *why* saying something like this is objectifying and wrong, and b) isn't rude and easily misinterpreted as ""overreacting""? Being offensive right back isn't going to change their behavior, only enforce it.

It often completely disregards the fact that women are fully capable of choosing who they wish to date, making it seem as though they're just too stupid or oblivious to notice the ""obviously superior candidate hidden right before their eyes."" It also perpetuates this odd stereotype that women are mystical, unknowable creatures who toy idly with the fates of men, and string them along for their own amusement.

That said, I don't really see how the friendzone *itself* is a sexist notion. It's totally natural for a male to wish to date a female who, though she may like him enough to be friends, has no wish to be involved romantically. I feel it's equally natural for that male to be upset, frustrated, and what have you.

Heck, this doesn't even need to be a gendered concept. I can even personally think of instances where I've friendzoned females, both knowingly and not. I feel like the whole concept is just a very convenient label for a necessary (if unpleasant) component of ordinary human interactions.

If you've been here more than like, 5 minutes, you are hopefully aware of why that is. Considering maleness the default is an issue, also it forces gender into situations where it's really not necessary. And what of people that don't really conform to the gender binary?

There's a few proposed solutions to this, including:

 * Let's make up new pronouns!

Problem here? Long story short, I have yet to find a way to pronounce ""zshir"" in a consistent way that is both easy to say and doesn't just sound like the feminine form anyway. And honestly the ze pronouns and whatnot, making z sounds all the time is rough on the mouth. No particularly aesthetically pleasing and intuitive set of these has been proposed.

 * Default to he!

Hahahaha no, fuck that and everything about it. [In fact here is a dinosaur comic that I found while looking for one I ultimately couldn't find that sums up the whole middle part of this post that sums this up nicely.](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1917) Men ruin everything, really, they had their turn with this and they did a terrible job.

 * Use they in the singular form!

My personal favorite and what I'm sticking with for now (and it's correct grammar-wise, no matter what they taught you in third grade English class). Still, it loses some nuance regarding singular/plural and to the uninitiated it can come off as a bit clinical.

_____________

All of these options are terrible and problematic for some reason or another. There is however, one option that isn't explored, but is obviously the correct one. It is thus:

**The current feminine form is used for everything, and we get rid of the male form. Everything is now she.**

This is the right answer, as feminine is better than masculine, women are better than men, and we don't need to make Z sounds constantly.

She set out the idea of being Trans as breaking down gender barriers. People tend to consider being ""Men"" and ""Women""as big monolithic entities which people have to conform. Men spend their entire life trying to enact a perfect hegemonic masculinity but they never do. Trans people seek to challenge that and say that being a ""Woman"" can encompass lots of things, not just whats between your legs. She gave the example of people treating gender as a ""Temple of Womanness"" which only ""Women"" are allowed into. Trans people want to stop this exclusionary idea which only isolates people and makes them uncomfortable.

But then she compared this to Feminism. In lots of areas important to feminists being a ""Woman"" is treated as a large monolithic entity, often for good reason. The idea of services specific to women such as careers advice, counseling, vocational training all enforce the idea of ""Woman"" being an exclusive category. Then she gave the example of a women's refuge for domestic violence cases which only women are allowed into. This really is literally a temple of ""Womanness"" which only women are allowed into. And we think it's a really good thing. It's important to construct being a ""Woman"" into this big idea which people can be a part of in Feminism.

Then she went on to say how trans people are trying to cheapen and reappropriate the idea of being a woman and we shouldn't support them which made me fairly uncomfortable...

This seems really wrong, I like to think I support all trans people and all gender and sexual minorities. But I can't understand why she is wrong on what she presented. Can anyone explain this? I get that this is kind of long and ranty and it's probably not the right place...

I'm sure someone will argue that laughing at a drag queen is actually laughing at oppression rather than the other way around, but that is pure shitlordery and could be applied to minstrel shows or any other racist/sexist humor just as easily.

I'm also not sex-negative or anything, but sex isn't incidental to the drag persona I've been encountering a lot, it is the central fact about them and they always manage to bring the subject back to sex while ""in character.""

1360601523.0,28,self.SRSDiscussion,18be4i,Child beauty pageants and the sexualization of young girls,ZombieAuxiliary,37,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/18be4i/child_beauty_pageants_and_the_sexualization_of/,"Hi SRSters.  By now we've all seen the hateful diatribes against Mama June from 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.'  Of course they're all framed in how gross Redditors think she is.  They hate their family for being low SES (socioeconomic status), proud (how dare they!), and according to them, physically unattractive.  Never mind that by many accounts, they're happy and love each other.  Not to mention they have a healthy sense of humor about what they do.

I must admit though, I have a big problem with child beauty pageants and wish people would stop involving their young daughters in them.  My reasons are manifold.

* sexualization of little girls.

* the pressure that comes from competition and children's tendency to internalize failure and the effects that has on healthy development of self-esteem.  I've seen footage of a few coaches and mothers who push little girls until they cry.

* little girls are taught that being pretty is the only way to win.

* dovetailed with this is the effect that happens when you are evaluated and judged based on your physical appearance.

* and, in my opinion, these pageants give pedophiles opportunity to normalize and excuse their psychosexual pathology.  

Maybe some of you were too young to remember the JonBenét Ramsey murder when it first happened, but it exposed the disturbing way little girls were presented in beauty pageants.  They were made up to look like tiny adult women and perform for (ahem) *admiring* adults.  A lot of their song and dance routines were not appropriate for little girls.  Like wiggling and strutting to Olivia Newton John's 'Let's Get Physical.'

Many people were appalled at the images of JonBenét in full costume and make-up.  I remember some people's comments read like ""She looks like a prostitute!"" or similar other opinions.  Unfortunately other people voraciously defended child beauty pageants saying they build character and taught little girls how to grow up to be ""proper, pretty little ladies.""  It was creepy, especially so when **grown men** were making these excuses and apologetics.

Anyway, I guess if anyone is doing it right, it's June.  Honey Boo Boo seems to genuinely enjoy participating in them and June makes sure she's having fun and not taking it too seriously.  So good for them.

But I still can't help feeling extremely saddened and creeped out by child beauty pageants.  A Facebook friend posted this picture in a group about sexual abuse (particularly religious abuse) of children.  I thought it perfectly summarized how I feel about these pageants.

There exist institutional advantages related to being cisgender that are supported and reinforced by the Church and the local church. Gone unexamined, these advantages do serve to oppress people on the trans* spectrum (transsexual people, gender non-conforming people, non-binary people and anyone else who does not identify as cisgender). Also, these advantages do have intersectional impacts on those who are oppressed in other ways, including women, people of color, disabled people and lesbian/gay/bisexual people.

These advantages are listed by section on the basis of what the typical conservative Church believes in*.

BEING AT CHURCH

* I am comfortable with what most church members determine to be my assigned gender or sex on the basis of my overall appearance
* On the basis of my gender, I am treated as either a man or a woman.
* In all church sermons, I am comfortable with what the pastor believes about being male or female on the basis of a literal interpretation of the Bible.
* I am comfortable with the existence of either a male or female washroom.

THE BIBLE

* The Bible validates my cisgender identity.
* I can relate to someone in the Bible on the basis of them having similar gender roles and/or being cisgender.
* I am comfortable with what the Bible says about my maleness or femaleness.
* If I am male, I agree that the Bible assigns me power over women.
* If I am female, I agree that the Bible requires me to serve men, even if I am only attracted to other women.

HETERONORMATIVITY/THE BIBLE

* The Bible supports my monogamous and heterosexual tendencies.
* There are monogamous and heterosexual role models in the Bible that I can relate to.
* I agree with the stories in the Bible that are not supportive of non-monogamy and non-heterosexuality.
* I believe that the best context for monogamous sexuality is within a one man, one woman marriage.
* If I am a woman, I believe that apart from helping my husband, I am there to reproduce.
* If I am a man, I believe that children are part of a Godly marriage.

MALE SUPREMACY (OR: WHAT THE PRESENTATION OF MALE AS A DEFAULT GENDER IDENTITY IN THE BIBLE MEANS FOR MEN)

[as a man, ...]

* My problems with the world can be easily solved through intervention.
* I do not have to be accountable to anyone else for my actions.
* I do not feel the need to consider anyone else's perspectives.
* I can demand to be respected without any repercussions.
* I only interact with my family and other people most similar to my family in beliefs and ancestry.

\* Conservative Christian Church is defined as a church that assumes the following as its interpretation of the Bible:

[Adam and Eve sin story:

God, being gendered as male, created the world and space in six days and rested on the seventh day.
God, in creating the world, created the solar system (including the Sun and the moon), the Earth, the water within the Earth (the sky and water), the land on the Earth, all animals within it (birds, livestock, etc.) and all plants on planet Earth.
God (He) created humankind in His image to makee use of all that He created on Earth.
God created Adam and Eve to be married to each other so that Adam would not be alone and so that Adam would have help. Humans were blessed to be fruitful and make use of His resources.
Adam was told not to eat from the Tree.

Eve was deceived by a serpent to eat from the Tree. Eve gave the fruit to Adam as well, and Adam ate it too. Because of this:


Serpent was cursed by:

The serpent would crawl on their belly and eat dust forever.

The serpent would be hated by Eve and her offspring.

The serpent would hate Eve and her offspring.

Eve and her offspring was cursed by:
Childbirth pain

Sexual desire for men

Men to rule over her and her female offspring

Adam and his offspring was cursed by:

Hard work]

Because of the sin of Adam and Eve, the world was forever cursed.

Through the toils and pains of humanity, there came out of it a solution: the perfect animal sacrifice, Jesus.

Through Jesus dying for all our sins, the world is no longer cursed but we are affected by the consequences of the sins of Adam and Eve.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,1350536003.0,,,True,t3_11oah6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11oah6/christian_cis_privilege_checklist_or_how_the/,

Reddit search is not very useful in this context. Also let me know if I'm asking the wrong questions/making assumptions that I don't realize.

I, like the rest of my generation, grew up being told that it's racist to call someone ""black"" and the proper term is ""African-American."" Thing is, I'm Canadian. The amount of times I've heard people use the term ""African-American"" to refer to Canadians is evidence enough that people don't think about the words that they use and the meaning behind them.

Overall, it's one of the best introductory sites for new skeptics, but they have some problems when deviating from that. Being self-identified transhumanists, they have incredibly common use of ableist language and concepts, and due to a demographic consisting almost entirely of well-off straight male white American libertarians, have an incredibly reluctance to admit to biases arising from this demographic makeup.

She's written ~~some quackery~~ an informative series on self-help in addition to a reimagining of Twilight confoming to their views, and a post on ways the community could become more accomodating.

They wayyy overuse jargon, and at times it can be [both scary and funny at the same time.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gv/statistical_prediction_rules_outperform_expert/3ezy)

The three main things I wish to call attention to in this series are two outright racist threads and how they dealt with it, a ""what's your specialest, snowflakiest opinion"" threads, and a thread calling out just how unfriendly they can be to those outside their majority demographic.


###Racist thread one: [""Is race realism racist?""](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ccp/is_race_realism_racist/)

Right off the bat, the original racist post is at -11 points, and there are comments calling it out at [+7](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ccp/is_race_realism_racist/6l02) and [+11.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ccp/is_race_realism_racist/6k92)

One of the things they have as a [cached thought](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/) is that ""politics is the mindkiller"", recognizing that because of tribalism and a few other factors, political discussions tend to implode very quickly. A cached thought that completely negates the benefit of acknowledging that is the idea that they are somehow enlightened and openminded enough to discuss controversial issues ""without being mindkilled"".

Nevermind the fact that the video in question was talking specifically about black Americans against white Americans, the former having been forcibly resettled from various places within Africa, the continent with the highest human biodiversity, and the latter being a blanket term for immigrants who came at some point or another from Europe, and have light skin.

Nevermind the fact that unless you're talking about highly inbred groups such as Ashkenazis or Icelanders, what we perceive as ""race"" has almost nothing to do with genetics, and a decent amount to do with culture.

After parroting off their disclaimer about how they are **SO BRAVE** for bringing up a topic, they descend straight into familiar redditry. The more worrying parts expounded elsewhere in the thread is that ""More men are at the top, but that's only because there are more men at the bottom"", and the fact that this group are BIG on evopsych, with ""evopsych"" and ""evpsych"" tagged posts comprising a decent amount of their main page.


###Racist thread two: [""An African Folktale""](http://lesswrong.com/lw/yl/an_african_folktale/)

Posted Eliezer_Yudkowsky himself (their leader), this one uses a Hausa Proverb about betrayal, and ends smugly with the statement ""I wonder if this has anything to do with why Africa remains poor.""

I personally discovered the site through Harry Potter And The Methods of Rationality, a fanfiction of if the Potterverse were reimagined among the lines of a weird humanist version of Atlas Shrugged. I liked it, and while massively TL;DR , it has some funny bits and some science (carefully selected as to present Eli's views as The One Truth) and it is to be noted that it was explicitly written as a recruitment tool.

One person who I've deliberately omitted throughout is lukeprog, a prominent contributor who studied theology until age 22, and seems to have rediscovered his Grand Purpose through the cult of Eliezer Yudkowsky. He wrote a sequence on ""The science of winning at life"", which deserves its own effort due to polyevangelism and endorsement of PUA, among biotruths and general poop. The second part will also address responses to prompts on how the community could become more accomodating.

The second is that discussion about the accuracy of the science discussed is irrelevant and off-limits.

[http://kateharding.net/faq/but-dont-you-realize-fat-is-unhealthy/](http://kateharding.net/faq/but-dont-you-realize-fat-is-unhealthy/)

This is a post included in the ""required reading"" section of SRSD. It's a good wake-up call to people who implicitly believe fat is inherently undesirable. I can understand how useful counterpoints to ""fat is unhealthy"" are in a culture that constantly antagonizes fat people using that logic. What makes me uncomfortable, however, is how heavily the author relies on these points, ignoring the issues which makes these kinds of reversals problematic.

Prejudice against the ill was extremely common in history, and it still persists today in a myriad of forms. It might not seem so relevant now when we no longer assume our friends with the flu are being punished by God. But the logical fallacy of associating bad health with bad people still breaks through when people are given any reason to believe an unhealthy person is doing it to themselves. Alcoholism and drug abuse are still not widely considered diseases in their own right, in spite of the mounting evidence which favors contextualizing drug dependence as its own syndrome. Smokers face increasing stigma as the use of tobacco is decreasing in some parts of the world. These are just some of many examples where people blame others for their afflictions while ignoring any other mitigating circumstances.

This post makes multiple attempts to debunk casual associations between obesity and poor health. Whether or not these arguments in themselves are accurate is unimportant, because I want to question why they need to be true in the first place. Isn't the stigma against unhealthy people what causes the ""fat=unhealthy"" paradigm to be marginalizing? If so, isn't attacking the association of fat with bad health, if not actively condoning that stigma, at the very least missing the point?

Maybe my argument is one large derailment, but I can't help but think this kind of advocacy, taken to its logical extreme, is suggestive of healthy, able-bodied people throwing everyone else under the bus. She says near the bottom of this post

&gt; 8. Even fat people who are unhealthy still deserve dignity and respect. Still human beings. See how that works?

This is somewhat reminiscent to me of saying things like, ""just because he's feminine, doesn't mean he's gay. And there's nothing wrong with that."" Obviously she has good intentions, and I could be tripping over a comparatively minor issue. However, I feel like there's got to be a way of fighting prejudice against fat that doesn't implicitly reproduce ableist modes of thought.

As a relative novice to many others who write about this, I'm very open to any other thoughts or rebuttals you might have.

(Note: If you find my use of the phrase ""fat"" or ""fat person"" to be jarring, know that I'm taking a cue from the rhetoric of the linked post.

I have been thinking a lot over the past few years about the types of mysogyny that are prevalent on online communities. It got me thinking about how to prevent it, how to offer a dissenting voice, if we could change peoples minds.

I spent some time on 4chan in the late 00's studying their behaviour and the effect it could have on a young persons mind. When I could I would interject with conscience laden posts questioning their motives, or abstract posts that may lead them to question their own intentions. What I was attempting to do was to show them that life doesn't have to be a certain way. That for all the facts people spewed, they were merely opinions repeated so often that they became ingrained.

Today is international women's day. I made a reply post in the low efforpost above regarding how young people who first come to this site have their minds affected by poop posts. I am an uncle of a little girl. I have cousins who have daughters that are teenagers. I talk at lengths with them about the dangers of the online world, and how in this day and age you have to be involved in your childrens online social habits. That they need proper education on the dangers out there. I show them videos like the Angie Varona story [possible trigger warning for harassment/stalking] as an example of what could happen to people if they aren't mindful of the zealotry of internet scumbags.

Because of all these factors, I thought of an idea. SRS has an effect on the problem on reddit, but what about off of reddit? What could we do to raise the consciousness off of the website? The only thing I could think of was to create some sort of speaking group that goes to schools (grade schools would be a great place to start, and high schools/college could have the most impact) to talk about issues like shaming, posting pictures online, sexualizing women. Addressing the problem we see on reddit that is prevalent elsewhere like facebook, tumblr, and photobucket. A task force that gives proper education on the dangers on the internet, as well as education for young men about how it isn't right what these people are doing and how to think for yourself. To promote the idea of empathy. A side issue that I feel passionately about is getting people to see that online people are just as real as people they see face to face. That if you wouldn't feel comfortable saying something to a person in front of them, you should't say it online. Creating a conscience coalition to combat the ignorance out there.

From speaking with parents at length about this, they are either completely ignorant as to what is going on or a lot of them give horrible answers to justify it. Boys will be boys, she is a growing young girl and wants to express herself. I have no problems with the expression of sexuality, but unless we do something to educate the youth, they will end up turning into what we fight today.

I can't say that this is my most passionate subject, and that I am going to start a group right away to be the change I want to see in the world. I have other projects that are similar that I work on, and if I can find the time to create something like this I will. Everyone here and on SRS are wonderful people. At first I was ignorant to what you people actually did, all I saw were negative stories about how you were a downvote brigade. By investigating what you were about, I came to realize that I wasn't alone in the way I felt about the general redditry. Maybe this post may inspire you locally to be this change I speak of, maybe you already teach the young people in your world.

It would be great to take the ideas you have here, and to export them to the outside world so that we can be a proactive group offline, instead of just a reactive group online.

What do you think? What do you do already to combat the situation?

First, some facts about me, in order of how important I consider them: I'm from America. I'm a Yankees fan. I'm a black person. I wear fitted Yankees hats. Starting a few years ago, I decided to stop taking off [the gold sticker](http://www4.images.coolspotters.com/photos/557918/new-era-59fifty-new-york-yankees-basic-purple-profile.jpg).

I admit, I didn't come up with it. [Here](http://pressroom.neweracap.com/category/30/category/21/In_The_News/page/219/San_Francisco_Chronicle.aspx)'s an article about the phenomenon. As far as I can tell It started in hip-hop, spread into the larger African-American community and then to America as a whole.

What I've noticed since I stopped taking the stickers off my hats is that I'm apparently making a fashion statement. People suddenly have opinions about my character based on the hat. I've tried to get to the root of the objection many times (including [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/q41dg/awesome_warning/c3uju5j?context=3), quoted below), and it always goes the same way.

&gt;I instantly think you're a douche for keeping the sticker on your hat 

Why?

&gt;It says a fair amount about you, as does following any social trend. Some are positive, some are negative.

Yes, but what does it say about me exactly?

&gt;It says you have some growing up to do before anyone takes you seriously.

How does it say that? What's different between yes-sticker and no-sticker?

&gt;About as different as wearing jeans and wearing jeans sagged well below your waist.

Got it: it's something black people came up with. I'm going to resist editorializing about this point because I hope to achieve something with this post and I could rant about it for hours.

This is not isolated to Reddit. I've encountered this argument maybe three times in real life (all from white people), and every time it's come down to the same thing.  As far as I can interpret my actions here, my greatest offense is ""allowing hip-hop culture to influence my style of dress."" This is construed as a negative thing in itself, without requiring context or further explanation. Is it an aspect of white (and male, in some contexts) privilege that the way you choose to dress is automatically correct, as long as you're not dressing like a minority? Does this happen every time white America starts doing something that hip-hop came up with?

In this post I found myself using ""hip-hop"" and ""black people"" interchangably, because...I guess that's just kind of how I see things. When I think about how I relate to black culture, a large part of it is hip-hop. I imagine lots of other people feel this way, including the people I'm arguing with. Is this backlash against hip-hop culture in particular, or black culture in general? (That is, classism or racism?) Neither? Both? Probably both.

Anyone got any data for race in the US in STEM fields?]

I think science is pretty great! I went into astrophysics because I loved it, and I was kinda sad to give it up. And I do engineering now. So it makes me kinda sad the kind of rep STEM gets around here. *It's really kinda justified though*; ""I'm still in High School but numerate science is the only legitimate avenue of study"" attitudes are prevalent across the website and it pisses me off too.

It doesn't make me nearly as sad, however, as seeing how poor a representation of society STEM subjects can be in terms of demographics. Physics was better, probably 2/3 male to 1/3 female, but let's not get complacent; there's no reason it shouldn't be half and half. And as for engineering... I do lectures from a mix of disciplines at the moment (part Electrical/Electronic, part Comp Sci, and a couple of courses of pure maths). Pure maths is probably 50:50. Comp sci, perhaps 85:15. E-Eng is really, really bad. There are lots of chinese students who come over to do E-Eng and amongst them the ratio is a clean 50:50; I have wondered if this is a consequence of the one child per family policy. But apart from them, among the ""western"" students and foreign students from other countries, there were perhaps 3 women to 60-odd men. That really alarms me. 

Are there any women here who would have gone into STEM fields if it wasn't such a sausage party? Have we trapped ourselves in a 'self fulfilling prophecy' of poor representation? Is it a case of a shortage of role models?

Is this a product of the school system lower down? Do you feel you weren't encouraged to pursue science and maths at school? Or discouraged from studying them to a higher level, be it by academic or social pressures? Should we be entertaining the idea that even in a non-patriarchal society, fewer women would *want* to do STEM subjects than men, and could we justify such an assertion without some god-awful evopsych?

And while we're at it, why do so few men go into biology? That's one STEM subject that near enough reverses the trend, at least here in my uni.

Similar themes can also be seen in children's media (My Little Pony). In children's media in particular, we see a lot of the ""you can do anything if you believe"" type messages, and sad or anxious characters are elevated with the right words or gestures.

Now, in mental health communities (depression and anxiety in particular), one of the most common frustrations (especially when dealing with peers and loved ones) is the attitude that these people can ""just snap out of it"" or ""just need to try harder."" Very trivializing indeed.

So, are these types of tropes the main (or at least a major) culprit for these types of attitudes? If so, is there a way to portray great feats of inspiration without the unsavory consequences?

They believe that ""privileged"" has taken on the role of a slur, or a pejorative, used to shut down any opinion they may hold on various issues regarding oppression.

I guess what I'm asking is how to explain privilege to them and how to explain that sometimes having privilege means shutting up and listening to what other people have to say.

It's probably a silly one and please correct me if I'm using incorrect or offensive vocabulary. 

So, I'm a teacher at University, and in the last  few years I've had some trans* students. I've read here, and elsewhere, that the right thing to do is to ask as carefully as possible which pronouns are preferred when referring to a trans-person, or simply try to be as gender neutral as possible until you can infer it from casual conversation.

My problem is that since these are my students, I don't have the kind of relationship with them where I can just walk up and ask them, or where I can infer their gender identity from casual conversation. I've tried to be gender neutral but it doesn't come naturally to me (I'm trying, though). The problem here is not having to make an effort to be gender neutral, it's just that whenever I refer to a student, it's generally in front on 50 or so classmates: asking them a question, expanding on something one of them has said, etc. I've found myself visibly struggling with the gender neutral version of what I want to say (my first language is spanish, where pretty much every single noun is gendered) in front of the whole class, and I feel like a total douche, because I'm making it worse by embarrassing and making my trans student uncomfortable.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how should I go about this? ask them? If so, how? Or just fumble with gender neutrality until it comes naturally?

Again, I'm really sorry if something in here is badly phrased or offensive, please tell me. Also, as I said above english is not my first language, so there's probably a bunch of grammatical errors and whatnot.

ps: I made a new account for this because I read somewhere else in SRS that it's better to have an alt account for SRS. If its not allowed tell me and I'll post it on my main account.

&gt;Why are we paying for public defense of accused indigents? Isn't this just another instance of the ever-expanding nanny state?

&gt;Provision of public defenders creates a circular dependence on government that spans across generations and removes people's incentive to provide for their own representation and the representation of their children. 
&gt;

Some of my initial thoughts include: people of color and ""indigents"" are targeted unfairly, prosecuted unfairly, and sentenced unfairly; even when you have ""gainful employment"" you can still be poor, a lot of people aren't in control of how ""stable"" their home environment is, lawyers are fucking expensive, and many more...

&gt;Background:
&gt;In late 2011 discussion among white supremacists began as to how to organize a midwest white pride meet-up. The idea merged with plans for an Aryan economic meeting (Pioneer Little Europe). Eventually May 19, 2012 was decided upon for the event. I believe the reservation was made under something along the lines of ""European American Heritage Association"" or something similar. The reality of the situation is that it was a meet-and-greet for several organizations, many of which don't normally play well together. The organizations we're sure were represented there were: -Knight's Party (David Duke's Mainstream Political KKK) -National Socialist Movement (Dress-up Nazis who pose as white civil rights group) -Council of Conservative Citizens (pro-segregation hate group) -FAWN (Family Assistance for White Nationalist) -Pioneer Little Europe
The meeting was cut short when approximately twenty men and women dressed in all black clothing wearing masks arrived. There are several different accounts of what happened next, but there are several things that are not in dispute. Ten white supremacists were injured. Three of these required hospitalization. Most of the white supremacists fled the scene, but two were arrested. One of the white supremacists, Steven Speers, was arrested for warrants for possession of child pornography. Another, Francis Gilroy, who has a violent record as a militia organizer was arrested for possession of a loaded firearm as a felon.
&gt;The Tinley Park Five were arrested in a vehicle about five miles away. They are being charged with 37 felonies each and held on bails from $175k-$250k each, or right under $1M for the group.

Sorry about the throwaway, but I don't want to link a nascent project back to the real world (it might ruin the surprise). I've been tasked with the creation of a mental health/social awareness curriculum for teens. One of the topics that my group insisted be included was 'cyber bullying'. It seems that there is a trend of kids creating twitter slam books and harassing each other over twitter. 

My own personal opinion (before this project) was that 'cyber' bulling is a manifestation of bullying in the real world and shouldn't really be treated as a distinct entity. This is now irrelevant, so I am trying to make sure that I am treating this topic as thoroughly as I possibly can.

It occurred to me that SRS discussion might be a great resource for materials related to being mean on the internet (which, although a gross simplification of the topics discussed in the Fempire, is probably a half-way decent place for me to start). 

What sorts of things would you include in such a curriculum? I was thinking of discussing the effect that proximity has on maliciousness, a la the milgram experiment and the kitty genovese case. 

Further questions: 
What is the best way to talk to kids about such a topic? Most materials  that I have read on the subject are painfully dated and focus on 'safety' when 'surfing the net.' I want to broach the topic without coming off as a middle-aged luddite.

Are there any online resources that currently exist which you would recommend including? It does not stretch my imagination to suppose that there are online communities that are 'safe spaces' and offer help to those who are experiencing abuse on, say, IRC.

It is a type of ownership relation that is about Absolute Domination of property. The justification given is that it is part of the social contract, the ability to create a relationship between the Subject (owner) and Object (property).

What is odd about this though is that can anyone really have a social relationship with an Object? What it actually is, when unfolded, is a relationship between Subject (Owner) and every other Subject around (the rest of society).

It appears that the owner exercise his will over the object, but what he is actually doing is exercising his will over is everyone else, who are prevented from using any Objects he has laid this claim of 'private property' on.

[Objectification Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_objectification#Objectification_theory) is a psychological ""framework for understanding the experiential consequences of being female in a culture that sexually objectifies the female body"" (1, p. 173). ""Objectification"" means treating a person as an object or merely a body. Objectification runs from leering and catcalling to sexualizing portrayals in media such as TV shows, movies, advertisements, music videos, and pornography. Objectification Theory provides a way of understanding some of the problems that differentially affect women in our society and other Western societies. This effortpost focuses on objectification of the female body and subsequently neglects interactions between, for example, objectification and race, and the effects of objectification on men, though these topics have been investigated (see, e.g., [Testing a Culture-Specific Extension of Objectification Theory Regarding African American Women's Body Image
](http://tcp.sagepub.com/content/36/5/697.short) and [Reasons for Exercise and Body Esteem: Men's Responses to Self-Objectification](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/sers/2005/00000053/f0020007/00007137)

1. [Objectification Theory: Toward Understanding Women's Lived Experiences and Mental Health Risks.](http://www.sanchezlab.com/pdfs/FredricksonRoberts.pdf) This is the paper that started Objectification Theory. Fredrickson and Roberts suggest that objectification may be at least partly responsible for the higher incidence of depression in women, sexual dysfunctions, and eating disorders. The suggested causal pathway is from objectification to self-objectification which results in habitual body-monitoring, which results in shame, anxiety, and distraction. This theory has received extensive empirical support to which I now turn.

2. [Objectification Theory and Psychology of Women: A Decade of Advances and Future Directions.](http://171.67.121.89/content/32/4/377.abstract) This article provides a nice overview of research within the Objectification Theory framework, including objectification's effects on men and interactions with race. The article displays the wide empirical support for Objectification Theory but also identifies limitations and directions for future research such as the need for more cross-cultural research and investigation of interactions with other variables such as age, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.

3. [Sexual Objectification of Women: Advances to Theory and Research.](http://204.14.132.173/education/ce/sexual-objectification.pdf) This article extends Objectification Theory to understanding substance abuse and presents a definition of ""sexually objectifying environments"" (SOEs) in which ""(a) traditional gender
roles exist, (b) a high probability of male contact exists (physically speaking,
a male-dominated environment), (c) women typically hold less power than
men in that environment, (d) a high degree of attention is drawn to sexual/
physical attributes of women’s bodies, and (e) there is the approval and
acknowledgement of male gaze"" (20-1). They give Hooters and related restaurants as examples of SOEs and suggest that more research be done into SOEs. Just such research will be discussed next.

4. [Experiencing Sexually Objectifying Environments: A Qualitative Study.](http://tcp.sagepub.com/content/39/1/67.abstract) This article uses the definition of SOE given above to investigate the experiences of 11 heterosexual female Hooters employees. The interviews highlight, among other things, the ambivalence the employees feel toward their job, the negative emotional effects of constant objectification, and competition with other women. I have to say, the concreteness and ""realness"" of this article can get depressing.

5. [Everyday Stranger Harassment and Women's Objectiﬁcation.](http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/KimberlyFairchildStreetHarassarticle.pdf) This article presents an investigation into the negative effects of stranger harassment. They found that stranger harassment was positively related to self-objectiﬁcation for women who reacted to stranger harassment with passivity and self-blame, but not for women who reacted with active coping strategies such as confronting the harasser. Stranger harassment was also positively related to women's fear of and perceived risk of rape.

6. [A Test Of Objectification Theory: The Effect Of The Male Gaze On Appearance Concerns In College Women.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00118.x/abstract) In this study, female participants were made to believe that they would be interacting with a male or a female. Mere *anticipation* of male gaze, but not female gaze, resulted in greater body shame and anxiety, but no changes in dietary intent were seen.

7. [The Role of Body Objectification in Disordered Eating and Depressed Mood.](http://www.unm.edu/~marni1/tiggemankuring2004.pdf) This study provides support for Objectification Theory's claim that objectification can lead to habitual body-monitoring, which can lead to depression and eating disorders. 

8. [The Role of Self-Objectification in

Theory.](http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/11/02/0361684311420250.abstract?rss=1) This article provides a more recent replication of the results of the previous study.

9. [My Body or My Mind: The Impact of State and Trait Objectiﬁcation on
Women's Cognitive Resources.](http://www.nyspa.org/docs/flash/mindbody.pdf) This paper investigates whether objectification can impair women's cognitive performance.

1. Tells them their life isn't complete unless they're getting laid regularly.  I suppose it shares a lot of its blame with TV and other media, but for a ""self-help"" book to tell its readers that seems more inexcusable than for random entertainment to carry the same message.
2. Says that interaction with women is pretty much for the purpose of getting laid.  I would place a massive bet that this damages their interactions with women, and probably with men who don't share a PUA-based set of values and goals as well.
3. Tells them that the only way they'll get laid is to follow its instructions.  That *has* to be a huge hit to their self-esteem, the whole ""In order for a girl to sleep with me, I have to lower her standards"" thing.  Perhaps you could find someone who likes you for who you are, instead of ""settling"" for you?
4. Says that interaction with women can be governed by a set of rules.  Any time you try to reduce human behavior to rules, you miss out on a vast majority of people who don't follow those rules.  You become less able to handle people than you would if you just relied on empathy and intuition.
5. Even if you aren't a PUA, you have to deal with their fallout.  Perhaps a woman was negged into compliance, and then dumped for the next HB to come along.  Any future partners she may have have to deal with that trauma.

Ooops.  And if people think that this post is inappropriate for this subreddit, I'll gladly delete it.  I'm new here, but this is an important issue for me that I'd like to hear more about.)

So. Cutting right to the chase, I'm a dom.  This means that I like to do some fairly *interesting* things to enthusiastically consenting people that in any other context would be clearly considered violent assault.  I'm not going to go into details unless you guys *really* want to know.  Most of my friends know about my being into the bondage part, and are cool with ropework -- I've even gotten a bunch of them interested in tying people up from an artistic (yes, it is an art in my opinion) and aesthetic perspective.  There are some very pretty ties out there, and in my opinion, having somebody hogtied on the floor is quite exquisite.

BUT!

People get *very* uneasy when I talk about the S&amp;M part, and there are certainly people that I would never let know about that side of myself.  I try to explain that no really, there are plenty of subs who absolutely love that sort of thing and definitely willingly consent, but it's very hard for some people to grasp.  There are a lot of people who see BDSM as nothing more than an excuse to make rape acceptable.

Then there's the gender role issue.  I'm a dude, and I generally prefer to dominate ladies.  I've heard of people who have a knee-jerk reaction about that dynamic -- that it's sexist, and reinforces negative gender stereotypes.  And unfortunately, I'm really bad at explaining that this is *not* the case beyond saying ""no really, just because I get up to kinky shenanigans doesn't mean that I don't respect the submissives.""

So if people are interested, I'd love to hear a discussion about these issues, and get a little bit of help in formulating arguments that BDSM isn't an evil terrible thing.

Or, to be fair, if you *do* think that BDSM is inherently negative, I would love to hear your opinion as well!  If we get a friendly rational debate going, that would be lovely.

Anyway, I wanted to hear some opinions on the matter. It seems straight men(especially young men) seem to have a fascination with anal sex with women. It is like it's a sacred thing to be prized above say vaginal sex. 

I'm going to take a guess that this has something to do with pornography, obviously. I mean is it still such a taboo when porn is absolutely *saturated* with it? [TW] And on top of that, these women clearly do not look like they are enjoying it. Sometimes downright crying in pain. 

But anal sex isn't a new thing. So is this about dominance? Humiliation? I have heard some men say it doesn't feel much different but it's a ""psychological thing"". No further explanation after that. 

Is this just a simple case of tasting the forbidden fruit? Because I don't think it's as simple as that. What are your thoughts?

I was chubby throughout middle and high school, and shortly after beginning college, I lost a lot of weight. A few years ago, after a bad car accident (which crushed my skull and pretty much messed me up for a while), I started gaining weight again (I could barely stand up straight, and would become fatigued after only minutes of most physical activity, so, y'know, that'll happen) and when I recovered, it continued to slide. For more than three years, I endured almost-daily ""concern for my health"", even when I was away at college; my mother would call me up and ask what I was eating.

None of the people involved were ""trying"" to be mean, but at many times, the sheer volume of feedback I got became aggravating and discouraging. Late last year, I finally decided to (once again) do something, and I started losing weight and feeling better about myself.

This is generally regarded as a good move on my part. Why not, right?

In it, she describes trying to get through a security check to get her house keys form her husband, and watching several white women be let through with no ticket, while she was not allowed through because, as the security guard stated, ""we have to be extra careful with *you all* after the Boston bombings.""

This story brings to mind all the many, many times that I, a white woman, have been let through some security point or another with little or no questions asked. In particular I am reminded of the time when I got to the airport only to realize that I had forgotten my wallet behind and had no ID whatsoever. Remarkably, I was still allowed to board my plane, with relatively little delay. I remember thinking at the time how unlikely that would have been if I weren't a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white person. Still, I got on that plane, happy and grateful that I was able to make it though security so easily. 

I know that our privilege (whether race or gender or sexual orientation or ability or whatever) follows us around at all times, subtly altering nearly every aspect of our daily lives, but I'm not often reminded of it so dramatically. I wonder what the white women passing by Jilani at the security check point thought. Did they even notice? What would you do in this situation? How about in my plane situation? I couldn't point at a hypothetical Muslim woman and say ""why aren't you letting *her* through too?""

Anyway, I've always been told that I should be ""aware of"" and ""check"" my own privilege, and I try. But sometimes it feels futile.

But he is also a really little guy. About half a foot shorter and one hundred fifty pounds lighter than myself. So he has absolutely no idea what it's like to be as big a person as I am.

He seems to have a problem with my weight though and it makes me uncomfortable to say the least. In one of my first lessons I was playing a slow lyrical piece of music and was having trouble completing phrases without breathing. It was something I was struggling with and I knew I needed to be more efficient with my air. My teacher said that I should try to expand my lung capacity. He suggested that I should do this by losing a bit of weight and that it would also be good for my health if I as I got older. This statement alone did not offend me. He's probably right and it seemed like a suggestion in good faith in order to help me with my tuba playing. I had no problem with that.

But it didn't stop there. The next week he asked me what my diet was like, which I found a bit odd. I had never had a teacher ask me about that before. He tells me that I need to eat healthier and that I should avoid fatty foods, soda, and beer. I didn't appreciate this advice and found it a bit condescending. I know how to eat healthy and and my diet is none of his business! He is meant to teach me music, not to badger me about my weight.

Every week since he has mentioned my weight during our lesson. I really don't think it is a productive use of either of our time since I know very well how big I am. It also makes me feel judged and uncomfortable. I want to be able to go to him for guidance with my music making it is really upsetting that I feel as if he thinks less of me because of my size, something I AM trying to deal with. In my own way on my own time. I dread going to my lessons and I feel as though this will negatively affect my ability to perform at the high level necessary for me to continue to perform in the ensembles that I play with. 

The worst of it came this evening in our lesson when he told me that I will not win a job unless I lost weight. His reason was that the committee would see me and would ignore how good of a musician I was and choose a thinner candidate instead. I fear that he is correct, and that is why I do intend to lose weight as well as for my health. My problem with that is that he makes no attempt to change the stigma attached to weight in classical music culture. He is very well respected and quite influential in the community I think he could affect change if he wanted to. But he does not, and this sort of rubs me the wrong way.

I hate feeling looked down upon because of my size and am very self conscious about it.


So, is my teacher fatphobic? 

How can I ask him to stop talking about my weight without pissing him off?

Let me know if I need to change anything.

A friend of mine has been receiving explicit text messages from someone in her office for about a week now. I told her to report it but things really didn't come to a head until today. The messages are getting increasingly aggressive and she is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. 

I am your classic SAWCASM with shitlord moments but understand most of the basic tenets of social justice issues. I have been trying to convince her to call the state employment sexual harassment hotline, file a grievance, and to take care of herself. Initially I was matter of fact about it but she is becoming increasingly resistant to advice. My concern gave way to frustration and I became too forceful in trying convince her she is the victim and needs to take action before it gets worse. I only tried for a little longer even after she verbally regretted bringing it up to me by citing me being over dramatic.

I want to convince her that she has the power to stop this. I talked about how this is textbook discrimination and harassment. She's worried about being blamed and thinks standing up for herself in her male dominated workplace will hurt her career prospects. She's scared of action and inaction. I don't know what to do and as a guy I feel like I'm becoming the patronizing figure by pushing her into action. Do I push her to do something she is uncomfortable with to get her to stop someone else doing something she is uncomfortable with? The irony is potent, I just want to do the right thing.

As a shitlord in recovery, oppression via patriarchy has never been more real. I always new it existed but never any first hand accounts. I'm so sorry to all the women that experience this, it's terrible. I want to help but don't know how or even if I can. She was even mentioning how 'this is just the way it is' and 'all women have to deal with this.' Fucking heartbreaking. I'd really like some direction.

I half-lied. No open mod mail this time, but we do need to go over some issues with our users.

**Pedo-apologia**

First up - Please familiarize yourself with the link to [why we insta-ban for pedo-apology](http://findpdf.net/pdf-viewer/Response-to-A-Reluctant-Rebellion-by-Alexandra-Gelber.html) in the required reading. If you don't have time to read it, I'll sum up some choice sections for you: in it, it gives first hand accounts of victims of child pornography feeling re-victimized whenever they see child porn. And this is why discussions like ""why isn't lolicon okay?"" or ""but all pedophiles aren't child molesters, so why treat them as such?' are strictly off-limits in this subreddit. We understand there is a lot of nuance to this topic that can't be easily summed up. But we also realize a lot of our users are or have been victims of child rape. They should not have to come across any discussion in defense of pedophilia or child porn in this space. If you want to discuss it, I suggest /r/circlebroke.


This also applies to threads to do with rape. Any such sensitive topics should first pass the test, ""Am I writing this with the utmost empathy knowing that actual victims of this awful experience may come across this discussion?"" If it doesn't, it will be removed. This is why we will remove for any discussions that only frame sexual assault in legal terms. **If you can't put the victim first in these discussions, find another venue.**


**Veganism and animal rights**

Every time this discussion has been brought up here it has always ended fraught with massive derailing from every side. If someone wants to discuss issues of race and class as it intersects with the vegan movement, please recognize that it's not about individual vegans. At the same time, if someone wants to discuss their personal vegan lifestyle, please do not make condescending comparisons like ""well why don't you protest the killing of soybeans, huh!?"" At SRSD, our stance is that we reserve this space for discussions of *human* social justice. Problematic comparisons between human oppression and animal mistreatment need not apply. **If you would like to discuss the ethics of veganism and animal rights, the right venue for that is /r/srsvegan which is now open to the public.**

**Edit:** Rosielala has graciously allowed us to continue [this removed thread about white veganism and comparisons of animal cruelty](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z6p10/white_vegans_and_comparing_eating_meat_to/) to genocide in /r/srsvegan.

**-Splainin'**

There's been some issues lately with users not understanding privilegesplaining. Please familiarize yourself with Rule II, particularly with the link to the Derailing 101 post. Simply put, if you are a man participating in a gender discussion, a white person participating in a race discussion, or a privileged person in general talking about an issue that you don't experience, please be careful not to explain how the marginalized should feel about these topics. Also, check your privilege (Rule III.)

**Mod Mailing**

Some mods have been saying that they've been receiving personal messages from users wanting to appeal their ban. If you were banned and would like an appeal, please use the mod mail function. Send a message directly to /r/srsdiscussion or use the link to your right in the sidebar right above the ""moderators"" listed box. Otherwise you probably won't get a reply.

As always, feel free to use this space to ask why certain topics were removed, and any concerns or questions you might have.

Couple of people pointed out a few flaws in the argument that native americans came from Asia originally and people born here aren't immigrants (which I never actually disagreed with).  
  
The thing is though, I never once had the intention of saying that no-one has a right to live in their own country. The intent of the cartoon was moreso to exhibit a flaw in the patriotic argument that immigrants should stay in their own countries. I feel like most of the people looking at this cartoon have totally missed the point of what I'm trying to say, and they still continue to - what irritates me though is that after seeing [one comment of mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ywlj4/a_day_without_immigrants/c5zhzc9) getting quite heavily downvoted I actually [tried to clarify my position](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ywlj4/a_day_without_immigrants/c5zorws) and the most it got was a couple of downvotes and was otherwise ignored.

* allows the human species to evolve itself

Cons (some are against because):

* denies the fetus the right to autonomy

I just finished college a year ago and have been hunting for a job in my field (education, secondary).  My first-ever job interview is tomorrow morning and I am searching for an appropriate combination of clothing to wear (it's a private parochial school, so my dress must needs be far more conservative than I wore student teaching in Queens, where blue jeans and sneakers were acceptable!).  As I often do, I headed to /r/teachers to check for existing posts on the topic, as they're nearly always a super-reliable, great resource.

Near the top was this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/v93j0/any_female_teachers_want_to_show_me_how_to_dress/
with accompanying comments.

Reading them frustrated and somewhat angered me--not necessarily at the commenters, most of whom seemed to genuinely want to help the OP--with the way society sexualizes women's bodies and simultaneously punishes them for any kind of ""fashionable"" dress; ie, one commenter here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/v93j0/any_female_teachers_want_to_show_me_how_to_dress/c52k7j7
mentions how she has a B-cup-sized bust and can wear button-down shirts with no issues, yet her bustier colleagues get ""feedback from supervisors"" regarding the appropriateness of their dress when they wear identical styles.

Does anyone else have a huge fuckin' issue with this?  I openly admit that I dislike (severely) the ""professional dress/business casual"" rules that Western society embraces, as both someone who loves tattoos and other body mods, and as someone who dislikes fashion conformity in general.  That said, I can and do dress ""professionally"" when my job requires it, as I am not in the business of going hungry or homeless for lack of income!

Can anyone share personal anecdotes of times when being a woman has specifically impacted what you are expected to wear much more than if you had been a man?  How do you feel about the ""professional dress"" sort of culture in the US and North America in general/Europe/some parts of Asia and Africa?  Are there any other teachers (or similar professionals) here who can give me some insight into what kind of dress they prefer and how their supervisors/administration reacts (if at all)?

And, before anyone bothers to type it out, ""SOMETIMES U GOTTA PLAEY TEH GAEMZ!  JUST B NORMAL AT WARK &amp; DRESS IN UR GOTH STUFFZ ON WEEKENDZ!"" is not pertinent, productive, or particularly insightful, even when written in legible English.

&gt;I'm not hating on America, but it is an extremely American idea.

(and i'm cool with you lauraofthelye, this isn't some soapbox assisted attack on you, don't worry)

my problem with this sort of sentiment is i've just heard it *all the time for years* from piles of hipsters/liberals/feminists/generally otherwise ""decent people™""

Now, i have a somewhat raised threshhold of when i'll write someone off. it's way too socially acceptable to casually use some ableist slurs, so i don't dismiss people for that. similarly, i've heard a lot of people who spout this rhetoric otherwise be *awesome*.

it just seems really disingenuous that the same mouths that spout with confidence that MRAs approaches to female on male rape are bullshit when 90something percent of rapes are perpetrated by men, even against other men then say shit like this that you *cant back up at all*.

basically, that america somehow has some borderline monopoly on selfishness and assholes. i know it's an easy target, but it's just *really* highschool smug ""i fukken hate amerika"" shit. at which point it's like ""really guys?""

there are assholes everywhere, there are *selfish* assholes everywhere. everyone isn't magically nicer when you get on a plane and go somewhere else. hell, most english speaking countries seem just as bad. 

like this whole chain

&gt;The desire to feel significant is universal among humans and has defined philosophical dialogue for centuries. It is definitely not ""extremely American"".

...

&gt;I think the distinction here is between the desire to feel significant and the impression that you already are incredibly significant and entitled to everyone listening to and agreeing with your views.

&gt;The latter is most definitely, at heart, an American idea.

However, with a little more exercise in caution and creativity, it is still possible.

Here is the primary rule for insulting people: Insult what they are doing, not who they are.  If, for instance, a gay person is disregarding the feelings of people with mental disorders, you want to target his insensitivity, not his gayness.  This makes it less likely that other people will leap to his defense, and that those who do leap to his defense are similarly bad people.

Scatological terms, one of the oldest forms of insulting, won't cause collateral damage.  Things like asshat, shitlord, etc. are simple and rather effective.  However, they're also sometimes seen as the lowest common denominator in insults.

Various synonyms for ""evil person"" also still work.  The varlets, scoundrels, and scumbags of the world have no lobbyists telling people not to use those words.  It may make you sound Shakespearean, but that's probably all to the good.

In fact, go all-out with flowery language.  This will get uninvolved people laughing at your target, and hopefully get them to realize what he said is wrong.  So, for instance, if a garden-variety redditor replies to a picture of a girl holding a cat with ""Take that cat out from in front of your tits"", your proper response should be something like,

""You sexist cur!  If you could have curbed your venality for just a microsecond, you would have seen that that was the absolute wrong thing to say.  Apologize to the lady forthwith, before I am forced to seek satisfaction!"" That vents your frustration in an effective and witty manner, and will probably get upvotes as well.

Can I still support feminism and efforts to inject a bit of equality into our world without actually delving into some of the discourse that is past the '101 level?'

Can I still enjoy the advantages of my birth without hurting feminism more than benefiting it?  If I speak out for women (and every other disadvantaged) and redirect opponents of feminism to those more knowledgeable than me, am I still adding to the health of the movement?  Or is my relative acceptance and compliance with the system too damaging to simply ignore?

I don't want to learn all of these detailed theories.  It brings me little pleasure to know the extent of the injustice and, to be honest, my girlfriend (who is even less of a feminist than I am) seems perfectly happy despite her societal disadvantages, which implies that the women I will know in my life might be happy despite their being pushed down.

I am not a moralist.  I don't think there is any right or wrong in the world because I also don't believe that anyone chooses anything.  The only set of morals I have (if you could even call it that) is that as long as an action leads to more people being happy, the action is OK.

I just want to know if I can be on feminism's side.  I want to be an advocate of equality, but I also just want to live my life and be as happy as possible.  Really, what else is there?

If I speak out against oppression when I see it, and if I use my maleness and whiteness (and any power I might be so lucky to obtain in the future) to support feminism, at least vocally, can I still consider myself being for the cause?

As you can imagine, some men are under the impression that women are in a privileged position because they get final say in whether or not they'll have sex.  I thought it would be interesting to dive into that a bit.  (And now that I get a second read-over, I missed some interesting bits)

&gt; For the sake of the OneY conversation, and for this one - there are assumptions made that this is primarily about cis hetero hookups and that any action taken is done with consent of all involved.

&gt; The ""keeper of sex"" position is inherently unprivileged.  Sure, you theoretically have the last word, but there's very little agency in it. In the ""Men get sex, women give it"" or that ""Lock versus Key"" mentality, the position that women are in is a defensive one, while men are in the aggressive position.  

&gt; Defensive positions are inherently less privileged than aggressive ones.  As men, we get the first call.  We get to choose who we talk to, how strong we come onto them, and when to start the conversation.  What do the defenders get to choose?  How to respond.  That's it.  (Again, within the confines of the hunter vs keeper of sex mentality) A woman has no input at all into the situation unless a man has already decided to start something.  Even better than that, depending on her responses, she runs the risk of being labeled a slut, prude, or a bitch.  She gets labeled based on her response to something *someone else started*.  This is not a privileged position.

&gt; (To veer off topic slightly - it's like being picked on by a bully twice your size.  Someone else has initiated the situation, your only realistic options are to fight back, lose, and get called a weakling, or give in and get called a coward.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't, and all because of someone else's decision.)

&gt; tl;dr:  Within this mindset, men have all of the power in initiating a hookup, women only get to choose how to respond to it.

&gt; Since this is OneY, I feel the need to expand out a bit, because these silly gender roles hurt everyone.  Still sticking with casual hookups, men may be privileged, but that doesn't mean the gender role isn't harmful.  Not every guy is 'alpha' and goes after whatever or whoever he can stick his dick in.  Not every guy is comfortable in anonymous public settings.  Not every guy is comfortable making the first move.  In all of these cases, the guys that aren't, *shouldn't have to be*.  When the only way to be ""manly"" is to score with some arbitrary number of chicks, or to be the center of attention at the pub, or whathaveyou, it marginalizes every guy who doesn't fit that mold.  It gets even worse with body types - because you can't change that.  It's only recently dawned on me that it's OK that I'll never have the lithe martial artist figure I thought I needed to have to be attractive.  

&gt; The less we rely on gender roles to govern our behavior, the happier those of us who don't fit them can be. 

As I re-read this, I notice I missed an opportunity to talk about perspective here - Guys tend to focus on the one-on-one portion of the encounter, forgetting about all the other women they could have talked to and the initial decision to talk to one in particular.  With that in mind, it's perfectly understandable that any given guy would feel 'powerless' in the decision whether or not to have sex.  Especially for less socially-adept guys, it's *extremely* difficult to keep in mind the fact that she wouldn't have a decision to make in the first place if it wasn't for his decision to talk to her.  In a sense, this entire mindset removes women's agency *entirely* because they are only defined by whether or not a man chooses to pursue them in the first place.

This also brings up privilege as an effect of agency - the side generally given bigger or more decisions to make is the one with privilege.  Clearly, in this hunter/hunted mindset, the men have agency and privilege, as they're the ones initiating things in the first place, and women are only able to make decisions based off of the ones the men have already made.

Then to finish it off, I feel like it's helpful to boil the argument down into a couple of sentences, for more casual or adversarial conversations where speaking time on a topic is limited.  ""In this hunter/hunted dating, romance, and casual hookup mentality, men have privilege - they get to decide who, what, when, where, and how to pursue someone.  Women only get the option of agreeing or disagreeing with a particular man's decision.""  Or put another way: ""Following this hunter/hunted rule, men can choose any woman they want to sleep with.  Women only get to choose from the men who have pick them first.""",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_prdcw,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/prdcw/gender_roles_in_casual_hookups_an_explanation_of/,

In preparations for a party my boyfriend and I were going to, we met up with a small group of friends to get ready and bake some things. His best friend's wife, who I hang out with very, very rarely, and I went out to the store to get some necessaries.

Along the way, we started talking about the city she lived in, and I mentioned I hated it because I always get lost, since I never go there. She immediately launched into a tirade of how much she hates the city because the majority of the inhabitants are black. She started a string of epithet-laden anecdotes about people cutting her off, getting arrested, starting fights. She started making cotton picking jokes, and at one point, yelled in the car, with the windows open, for the ""[slur] to cross the street faster."" He definitely heard her, and I ducked down in the car, humiliated and infuriated. I kept trying to change the subject, and to interject ""I don't think you should say..."" but she kept cutting me off with, ""You have no idea, there's only white people where you live.""

That is completely inaccurate. I live one city over, where it is pretty evenly split between black and white, and I am the only white person in my building at work. I felt completely helpless against her -- to start fighting her on this would mean a huge blow out with her, and that would lead to a blowout with her husband, and it would trickle down into our entire group of friends. My father is pretty racist, but he knows how I feel about him talking about it. I've made my points with him, and he has made his, and we don't talk about it anymore, but I can fight him on it because I know him. I don't know this girl well enough.

But then I was wracked with guilt for days because I feel like by staying quiet, I enabled her racism, and I am just as bad, because since I am white, I don't have to change anyone's minds to get them to like me. This happened a week ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I've had open discussions with openly racist people before, but they were pretty smart and it was a productive conversation. She just assumed that since I am white, I felt the same way, and it was a waterfall of horror.

What should I have done differently? Has anyone else experienced this before and reacted better than I did? I've never been trapped in a small space with someone who is so violently racist that she believes black people should be made slaves again, ""because at least they had work ethic"", and every point I tried to make is one that requires a fair amount of critical thinking, which she obviously lacks.

In particular, he is of the belief that chivalry is not dead, and that it should be practiced still today as a sort of righteous code of conduct.

He defines chivalry as:

&gt;sticking up for those who don't have the means to stand up for themselves, Loyalty to those who you are close with, and honoring those who earned your respect

and his rationalization for being a proponent of chivalry is:

&gt;I'm a martyr at heart and I've seen too many close friends and family members get bullied and harassed. Sticking up for people, being courteous and helping those less fortunate are the right thing to do and hardly a bad ideal or belief to stay true to. In today's society, few people look out for others first and I believe that that is an issue.

How do you respond to this? My instinct is that chivalry as a set of values is still oppressive because it is based on the idea that some people *need* saving by some gallant gentlesir in some greater position of privilege (chivalry, it seems, rather than addressing at its root the problem of societal inequality, merely allows those already in a position of power to fancy themselves heroes), but, at the same time, I can't argue against the value of sticking up for the underdog since that's what I like to believe myself to be doing as an advocate for social justice. 

The word itself, ""chivalry,"" bothers me because it's antiquated, but I suppose my disdain is not unlike the disdain many hold for the word ""feminism"": I don't think it's wrong to want to help people who need help, but I don't think referring to it as chivalry is useful. I worry that I, in this position, am like the ""equalist"" or ""egalitarian"" who doesn't like to label themselves a feminist because of the prefix ""fem-"". However, I am, of course, of the belief that feminism *is* the proper term, and that to deny that would go against social progress, so I would imagine that this man feels the same about the word ""chivalry"" as opposed to just calling his beliefs ""being nice to everyone because it's the right thing to do.""

I guess, to summarize, my question would be **is chivalry, even just in the sense of sticking up for those who are less fortunate, inherently problematic and, if so, how can this be easily explained to someone not well versed in social justice concepts?**

[Trigger:child abuse],dildzwielder,57,27,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1dkzzd/can_we_seriously_discuss_reddit_and_its_relation/,"Over in /r/sex right now, there is a post of a woman who has just found out her boyfriend has been looking at softcore childporn on HER laptop. I would advise all, if you are going to go over there and look at her submission and the comments, to refrain from commenting unless you, yourself, have very useful advice that can help her in her situation. That being said, I would like to discuss reddit and its relation to CP.

In the post, the woman says she has found evidence on her computer of him going to sites that have pictures of young prepubescent girls dressed in their underwear. She has talked with him about it and he has basically admitted that he has looked at these sites in a sexual manner, and she is asking what she should do now. The top responses reddit has come up with are advising him to see a therapist. There are a few upvoted comments that focus on her legal safety but the outright cry is for him to get help not her. 

Now, I understand that suggesting therapy for a pedophile is indeed good advice and that when looking at a subreddit like r/sex, you are bound to get a more open community towards sexual preferences. However, when a person comes to a site asking for advice, the main concern should be focused on the person asking for advice, not the person they are asking for advice about. The main focus should be on protecting and helping the poster, not this unknown pedophile. After reading the comments and consistently seeing ""seek therapy"", ""seek therapy"", ""seek therapy"" and finally way down in the thread finally finding advice for her to protect herself from CP laws and to consider going to the police to protect the victims of CP it has led me to the question: what in the actual F. is reddits deal with CP? 

Reddit was once home to the beloved /r/jailbate and constantly is bombarded  with pedopologists whenever the topic of CP comes up. You cannot see a post of a young teenage girl without the word ""ephebophile"" being used at least 20 times. Why is this?

I stumbled across this subject while browsing /r/SRSMythos, where someone linked to [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/14ajar/a_talk_about_high_suicide_rates_among_boys_at/c7bdi1b) comments about a protest at a Warren Farrell talk. The protesters, apparently, are feminist, and are saying Warren Farrell is a rape apologist. So I was wondering what the deal is with this guy and did some googling. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Farrell#Critical_reception) he supports Feminism, and is a part of the Men's Movement (not to be confused with the Men's Rights Movement, or at least, I've been told they're different). Apparently he used to work for NOW (National Organization for Women), but left because he felt their views had become anti-man and anti-father. He's also written several books, which I haven't read, that deal with men's and women's issues. And he's been criticized by other members of the men's movement for using gender-neutral language and being a ""feminist apologist."" His books have titles like *Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say* and *The Liberated Man*. A recent book, *Do Feminists Discriminate Against Men*, was a debate book written with feminist co-author James Sterba.

So, I have some questions.

* First of all, has anyone read his books? I don't know what to decide about them, from my cursory glance at their descriptions. On the one hand he seems to be acknowledging the need for and legitimacy of Feminism. But on the other hand, that last book, *Do Feminists Discriminate Against Men*, sounds like it could be rather ""what about the menz""-y. Also, I'm skeptical of a man writing a debate book with a feminist co-author who is also a man. Call me discriminatory, but I think if you want to argue about feminism with someone who has a feminist perspective, you ought to do it with a woman. Men can be Feminist allies for sure, but I think it's difficult for someone who's never experienced women's issues to really speak about them.

* Anti-Feminists seem to really hate this guy, calling him a ""feminist apologist"". Which makes me think that he himself is for feminism. But obviously that may not be the case. People often get angry when members of their own group aren't ""hardcore"" enough (example: The conservatives who felt Mitt Romney was too moderate). So is he really on the side of Feminism? Or by ""feminist apologist"", do his critics mean that he isn't anti-feminist enough?

* He was invited by the White House to be an advisor to the White House Counsel on Women and Girls. So the White House apparently thinks he's pro-women enough. Again, that doesn't really mean anything. There are all kinds of reasons to appoint someone to a counsel, including trying to look as though you are neutral on the issues by appointing people from both sides of the debate.

* What's the deal with the accusation that Farrell is a rape apologist? What did he say? Is he a rape apologist? 

So SRS, what do you think? And, as always, I thank you for your help! 

Edit: Oh wow, I just found [this](http://www.thelizlibrary.org/fathers/farrell.htm). Apparently he's said that women say ""no"" verbally but say ""yes"" with their body language? Okay, so that answers the question about whether or not he's a rape apologist. Actually, it answers quite a lot of questions. Yuck.

Firstly I hope this is the write subreddit and secondly I'd like to check my SAWCSM privilege. 

I just came up with what seems to me be a reasonable idea. How about we create a community driven series of web videos designed to educate people about issues often discussed in SRS, basically seeking, through education people who might otherwise not even attempt to understand the concepts that are often discussed here. This is brought on by a comment I posted yesterday of a VlogBrothers video about sexuality (available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXAoG8vAyzI)) which was rightly called out upon as being cissexist. I'd like to create videos in a similar format but in a way which could be created in a community verified way i.e. the script for each episode could be posted here and it would be vetted before it goes into production.

A non-exhaustive list of ideas for episodes (inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11muhv/meta_resource_compilation/) resource compilation):

- Trans 101
- Privilege 101
- Rape culture
- Asexuality 101
- Feminism 101
- Ableism 101
- Intersectionality 101
- Body-shaming 101
- No, Seriously, What About the Menz?

Anyway let me know what you all think. 

Edit: Okay, the feedback seems to be good. Would anybody be interested in creating the videos with me? Either reply here or send me a message.

My friend is a pretty decent person and I get along with him well. His friends that I met that night... well, let me just say that they remind me of typical redditor neckbeards. I felt pretty swarmed by them the whole night - a lot of attention was focused on me, as if they haven't seen a woman in years. One guy even seemed like he was trying to neg me or something, argh.

I guess I shouldn't say *all* of them are that bad - out of the 4 guys, 1 of them seemed pretty nice, just socially awkward that's all.

Then of course, the next day they all (except for the 1 I just mentioned) add me to Facebook (I did not give them my info, but I thought that wasn't that bad, since its just Facebook and sometimes people find you) and then one of them asks me out. I said no, and told him I don't swing that way (I'm queer-identified, but pretty damn gay-leaning) and he needed the meaning of that clarified, so I told him I'm queer. Then he asks me if I have sex with men... ew, what a creepy question! I just ignored it, and he messaged back after a couple days ""realizing"" that what he said might have ""sounded wrong"", and I just told him that I'm a lesbian (I really didn't feel like explaining my sexuality to him). 

The awkward part is that this guy is my friend's brother, and I have no idea if he (the creeper) told my friend about this whole thing, but I can't really say or do anything because they are brothers. If he wasn't my friend's brother, I would have just deleted him right away (or ignored his friend request) - but yeah, this is awkward. 

I genuinely like my friend (as a friend) and want to be friends with him without any weirdness. So how do I deal with his brother being a creeper? And his neckbeard friends?

The rest is trying to articulate what the original article was also covering. The article was called Real consent vs. Enthusiastic consent.

So, I have noticed two serious problems when people talk social justice recently on SRS* and in /r/lgbt.

**Assumption of equality.**

Social justice discussion usually recognizes that there are power structures that do not make everything equal in society. 

Failing to recognize power disparities as in saying ""But I have it hard too!"" is very much problematic as it invalidates lived experience and denies the reality of these disparities in society.

Also, splaining does imply an assumption of equality through majority lens. A common example of that as seen in the media is around welfare, the myth that people on welfare are too lazy to work. This is not true. This myth is splaining as it seeks to explain something thrrough a privileged mindset.

**Irrelevant discussion.**

*THIS IS NOT SIMPLY OFF TOPIC DISCUSSION*

Often, irrelevant discussion manifests not only in splaining but also in terms of making either true statements that people in the discussion should know already, or in making statements that derail the discussion so as to avoid unpleasantness.

There has recently been a change in enforcement about our anti-ableism rules. Far less leniency, to be precise. I agree with the change. 

However, there seems to be a lack of congruence in the community as to what constitutes ableism, ableist behaviors, ableist words, what have you. 

For example, I earlier made a post identifying myself as an ""aspie"", for I have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. This post was reported a couple of times. For this reason, a moderator suggested I remove that word from my post. I obliged, not wanting to act in an exclusionary fashion towards other people living with ASDs. Later though, the moderator retracted and said that he/she ""messed up"" and that I should just forget about it. That confused me. 

There has also been controversy over the ""Empathy BEEP BOOP"" smiley and how it could potentially be insulting to people who, due to ASDs and other disorders, struggle with the ability to express empathy. 

So ladies, gentlemen, et al, I think we need to get together and just... *talk*. We need to get some more agreement on this issue, as it's shaping up to be quite controversial. 

What's ableist? What ableist words should be avoided? What behaviors should we avoid? Any other potential questions? Every issue that could relate to ableism and disabilities is fair game. 

Go.

Inside of me (at the time anyway) I was deeply prejudiced against trans people. It is to my eternal shame that this is true. I never vocalised  any opinion but they were there.

Just by being in contact with her, I learned so much about the constant barrage of abuse transgendered people suffer from Cis people (like me at one point!).

Okay, I feel the need to elaborate a bit since I haven't been quite getting the kind of responses I've wanted. 

For one, the specific people I am talking about are not trying to derail feminist conversations with name semantics. They are capable of having feminist discussions and applauding the feminist movement.

The issue that they seem to have, as far as I can tell, is that the name 'feminism' in deriving from 'feminine,' focuses on women, and does not account for the intersectionality of oppression, including race, sexuality, class, and many more (although the *movement* of course does). 

The only reason I have been able to come up with for sticking with the name is the important historical aspect, but I am not sure how to articulate how this means we shouldn't come up with a more inclusive-sounding term for the future.

",,32,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/r6ulb/srsd_what_is_your_reaction_to_teju_coles_the/,"This morning, I read [this article](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/the-white-savior-industrial-complex/254843/) from The Alantic, and I was interested in what the reactions of SRS and SRSD members would be to thie article, so I decided to open a thread in SRSD. Here are some choice quotes from the article:

&gt; But **I disagree with the approach taken by Invisible Children in particular, and by the White Savior Industrial Complex in general, because there is much more to doing good work than ""making a difference."" There is the principle of first do no harm. There is the idea that those who are being helped ought to be consulted over the matters that concern them.**

and

&gt; One song we hear too often is the one in which Africa serves as a backdrop for white fantasies of conquest and heroism. **From the colonial project to Out of Africa to The Constant Gardener and Kony 2012, Africa has provided a space onto which white egos can conveniently be projected. It is a liberated space in which the usual rules do not apply: a nobody from America or Europe can go to Africa and become a godlike savior or, at the very least, have his or her emotional needs satisfied. Many have done it under the banner of ""making a difference.""** To state this obvious and well-attested truth does not make me a racist or a Mau Mau. It does give me away as an ""educated middle-class African,"" and I plead guilty as charged. (It is also worth noting that there are other educated middle-class Africans who see this matter differently from me. That is what people, educated and otherwise, do: they assess information and sometimes disagree with each other.)

and

&gt; Let us begin our activism right here: with the money-driven villainy at the heart of American foreign policy. To do this would be to give up the illusion that the sentimental need to ""make a difference"" trumps all other considerations. What innocent heroes don't always understand is that they play a useful role for people who have much more cynical motives. The White Savior Industrial Complex is a valve for releasing the unbearable pressures that build in a system built on pillage. **We can participate in the economic destruction of Haiti over long years, but when the earthquake strikes it feels good to send $10 each to the rescue fund. I have no opposition, in principle, to such donations (I frequently make them myself), but we must do such things only with awareness of what else is involved. If we are going to interfere in the lives of others, a little due diligence is a minimum requirement.**

My main question is does this necessarily change when we look at minorities that are less oppressed, but still end up adopting hateful rhetoric towards the privileged majority. For example religious minorities like muslims and atheists in the US often engage in anti-christian rhetoric, but it seems like we don't extend the same leniency towards them as we do with other minorities. To me this is most abundantly clear with respect to /r atheism. It's quite common for SRS to express disgust at a lot of the anti-christian comments that are frequent in /r/ atheism, and often we deride the subscribers of /r/ atheism as not being able to distinguish moderate christians who do not actively engage in the oppression of religious minorities, and the intolerant bigots who are legitimately at fault.

My question is whether this inconsistency in how we perceive a minority reacting to their oppressors to be a result of atheists not being visibly oppressed to nearly the same extent as other minorities, or if there is something else at play here.

Loosely defined, [Institutional Abuse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_abuse) is abuse that takes place in an institution, *or* as supported by an institution.

It can happen to [Adults with higher care needs](http://www.cnpea.ca/abuse_in_institutions.htm), [children](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/publications/nfntsdisabl-eng.php) with high care needs, [so-called](http://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/l7r94/welcome_rfirstworldproblems_if_you_are_like_most) troubled [teenagers](http://fallenfromgrace.net/tag/survivors-of-institutional-abuse/) who fall too far outside of social norms, or to anyone that has a lower place on the pole of privilege. Examples include a real or perceived [mental health crisis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15985915), an encounter with [police](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2010/11/26/ottawa-bonds-video-response.html) or even your [heritage^TW-residential.school](http://www.niichro.com/womhealth/wohealth7.html). Essentially, if you depend on an institution, and it abuses that trust (an employee sexually assaults you, steals your money, over-drugs you, beats you, manipulates you, etc or otherwise behaves inappropriately to the situation, such as exploiting your vulnerability) then you have encountered institutional abuse first-hand.

While this type of abuse is less acknowledged than some, there are solutions!

[Awareness](http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=e4193e77-13a1-4dea-a0cf-9edb43a0efe5) is obviously the first step, and then the institution at hand, in this case [the banking industry](http://www.cba.ca/en/consumer-information/42-safeguarding-your-money/483-financial-abuse-what-seniors-need-to-know), tries to make the appropriate changes. Along the way there is a rough road, as institutions tend to try to protect themselves.

Some Churches have yet to see why change is necessary and practice ['kidnap for Christ'](http://www.reddit.com/tb/pdmc9). Others, such as the [Catholic Church](http://www.ranker.com/list/christian-priests-convicted-for-sexual-abuse/robert-wabash) are starting to be forced open.

[Others](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p87l6/iam_maia_szalavitz_author_of_the_first_book_to/) are still at the 'whistleblower' stage of openness. 

But there are glimmers of hope! [Mental health advocacy](http://www.mental-health-abuse.org/) for example, has done a stunning amount of work in the past few decades, as some [facilities close](http://www.reddit.com/tb/p9954) allowing for more open programming. Police too, are starting to be held [accountable](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/01/19/toronto-g20-adam-nobody-report.html).

That's fine. I think we all know, or are mature enough to accept, that domestic violence is unacceptable and males are the main perpetrators.

BUT- big but- is male domestic violence actually a larger issue than we make it out to be? Normally it's mocked as MRA ""what about the menz"" type whining. But a brief search will reveal that it may be a hidden scandal. 

This is particularly horrific- http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5092100.stm
60% of women approved of assaulting their partner in a sample of Scottish women- in total, 4,800 of 6,500 women sampled said this was okay.

Right now we're conversing on whether or not, by being offended by the c-word and asking him not to say it, I am perpetuating its stigma and giving the word power.  He believes that the onus should be on the repressed group to change how they feel about slurs, and I think he said that he doesn't see how sexism is still a problem in our culture.

Does anyone have any suggestions for recommended reading I can show my buddy?  Stuff from peer reviewed journals or things written by men or pieces that are especially effective/resonated with you?  I'll take any suggestions.  Also, any experiences you all have had trying to have discussions with people who are not receptive to hearing arguments in favor of feminism might be helpful/fun to read.

edit:  doesn't have to be related to the brief topics I laid out - - any articles relating to privilege or feminism in general that could be effective in changing someone's mind or providing an introductory understanding to SRS-style ideas would be hugely appreciated.

I'm Irish, living in Ireland, a member of the settled community, ethnically catholic (though atheist), and I'm talking about race, so I may be privilege-blind to things*

So when talking about lots of oppressions there's often a few categories, like straight/gay/…, cis/trans/…, male/female/…. Often white/(black|PoC)/… is used when referring to race/ethnicity. However, as an Irish/European, I find this to be a simplification that doesn't fit very well IMO in Europe/Ireland/UK. I *think* the whole ""white race""/""black race""/etc. are more common in USA due to that being how it was often talked about there. As in, someone was either white, or black etc. Whereas here in Europe &amp; Ireland, yes, someone is white, but they are also either a Irish (vs. Polish), or Traveller vs. member-of-the-settled-community. I find that ""white"" seems to lump lots of people (i.e. all ethnic white Europeans) together. Whereas there's often a lot of racism among ""white"" people of Europe based on ethnicity.

So I wonder is there a ""better"" term than ""white""? Within the USA ""white"" probably makes a lot of sense to talk about, but it seems imprecise within Europe. What do people think?

One problem with ""white""/""black""/etc. (I think) is that it can make people think that skin colour is all there is to racism! That a white person discriminating against a white person of a different ethnicity is not racism! That settled people in Ireland can discriminate against Travellers because, ""they're white, so it's not racism"", that europeans can discriminate against Roma people because they're white, so it's not racism! So they think it's OK! (It's not obv.)

Lots of [anti-discrimination laws I've found](http://aethalmaer.tumblr.com/post/39653836710/pretty-much-all-legal-definitions-of-racism-include) don't just talk about ""race"", but ""race/ethnicty"". So lots of ""legal"" definitions of racism, include ""ethnicity-discrimination"" as a part of ""racism"". I wish more people knew that.

I can't really think of a better term than ""white""… Something like ""Irish-privilege"" only works in Ireland (likewise ""British-privilege"" in the UK, etc.). ""native"" is not often used that way in English. Any thoughts?


P.S.: Now obviously, there is a lot of racism against black people in Europe (and Ireland). Especially against Africans.

While it cannot be denied that racial privilege exists, it seems reasonable to me that one can oppose a purely race-based AA as overlooking other axes of oppression.

The common hypothetical trotted out is a wealthy black student being selected over, say, a poor, white/Asian, [insert disprivilege here] student. And indeed, some have argued that this result is born out in the empirical data.

*What I am suggesting is not eliminating race as a factor in AA,* but tempering it to account for other disprivileges. In the status quo, blacks receive an average 310-point lift across the board. But if we take intersectionality seriously, shouldn't a wealthier black student get a smaller bump? And if we take wealth seriously as an axis of oppression, why *shouldn't* a poor white student get a bump as well?

It seems to me that intersectionality allows for the possibility that a poor white student is less privileged than Jaden Smith. This is the common conservative objection to AA, but also seems completely compatible with liberal theory once we account for intersectionality.

I had the opportunity to attend a talk at an anarchist convention in London, where a number of Sex workers talked about their experiences, and how they felt that prostitution was preferential to other jobs, or in the case of some ex-sex workers, that it was at the time their preferred option. 

I realize this is a complex issue, and I am rather ignorant in it, but it seems to me that it is undeniable that for some women (and men) sex work is choice they freely make, and in some cases enjoy.

That being said, I was wondering what SRS thinks of People who solicit sex workers. 
I ask because I personally do not see any fundamental problem with sex work, as long as its consensual and regulated in such a way as to protect the sex worker. 

However I still can't help, but feel that people who solicit sex, are somehow doing something immoral. I certainly would feel somewhat uncomfortable soliciting sex, and I tend to see people who have solicited sex as somewhat, well, creepy. Even though I don't really have an objective reason for this. 

Am I being silly? 

Part of this might be because I recently traveled to south east Asia for a university course, and there was a lot of sex tourism that was very openly visible. 
Frankly, I just couldn't help, but somewhat despise and stereotype all the different kinds of people who solicit sex. It felt they where using the women which of course is not too far from the truth, not to mention the human trafficking that occurs a lot in those areas.

I sometimes hear MRAs saying they want to work with feminists.

They want to fix the issues that both genders (I know, only acknowledging a gender binary is bad, but I'm speaking from their perspective) face, although they often want to go about it differently from feminists (due to not believing there's a patriarchy among other things).

At the same time, 95% of the feminists I've seen want nothing to do with MRAs and seem to hate them with much more fervor than MRAs hate feminists (not a tone argument, just an observation; I understand that we as women have valid reasons to be resentful). 

I don't want this to sound like the ""You should call yourself an egalitarian not a feminist!"" argument, but I just wonder why there's more of an effort to ""reach across the aisle"" by MRAs than by feminists.

Her skin is painted pitch black, with minstrel-like red lips, and yellow eyes with dollar-sign pupils. Whether or not the black face is intentional (as in meant to be old fashioned minstrel black face, or just some dumb white person who doesn't know what black face is and painting themselves black for ""art"" or whatever), the racist imagery is pretty inescapable. 

I've been seeing the argument that the video is a comment on Westerner's distorted perceptions of African life, and that the black face goes with that. I feel like that is a pretty shitty reason to dress up in black face, especially when the people portraying that message are privileged rich white people who live in a place with systemic white supremacy. I understand the desire to poke fun at Westerner's ignorance about South African culture, and the homogenization of Africans by Westerners. I myself am admittedly not knowledgeable about  South African culture... and I guess this is why I came here,  to see if any femperialists know and could perhaps shine some light. 

Two main arguments in defence of Die Antwoord:

- A lot of people seem to like referencing the lyrics from the song ""Whatever Man"", and how the rappers from Die Antwoord are totally Not Racist^TM

&gt;Check it,
I represent South African culture.
In this place you get a lot of different things:
Blacks,
Whites,
Coloured,
English,
Afrikaans,
Xhosa,
Zulu,
watookal.

&gt;I'm like all these different things,
all these different people,
fucked into one person.

&gt;Whatever man.

Which is like... okay... that is being sung by some well off, english-speaking South African man. This really seems like co-opting rather than a well thought out anti racist sentiment.

- That in South Africa black face has a very different context, and that it is not seen as a big deal or even racist at all.

I am aware of the minstrel festival that happens in South Africa... but the most important part to note is that it isn't white people in the make up, it's black working-class people.


My intuitive response to the video is that it's shocking imagery used by Die Antwoord to get a lot of views by being soooooo super edgy. But really, I don't want to play into a Western-centric point of view here... is there something I'm missing about SA culture? I guess this is the main reason why I haven't really voiced my outrage or opinion... I just... don't know.

Being oppressed means *the absence of choices.*"" I think primarily talking about the 2nd wave, she talks about how middle class white women made their own interests the primary focus of the movement and how they ""employed a rhetoric of commonality that made their condition synonymous with ""oppression."" She also discusses how radical feminism has been shoved aside in favor of liberal feminism. 

I wonder if the current ""movement"" thinks about the conditions of all women as much as it should. By movement, I'm thinking about what gets attention in the media (which I know is not the full extent of feminist activism there is). What gets attention in the media is stuff like getting contraception covered by insurance or things regarding equal rights in the workplace or issues regarding domestic violence and sexual assault. 

Does the current movement do enough for all women? I'm not sure. I feel like the whole reproductive rights movement does not pay enough attention to the issues of poor women or pay enough attention to the history of black women and forced sterilization. Many women don't have insurance, so they still probably have difficulty getting affordable contraception. There's also been a huge history of society trying to make it difficult for black women to have and mother their own children. I guess what I'm wondering is if the current ""movement"" is doing enough. Why isn't it more radical? Are their feminists/activists out there trying to address some of these more urgent issues in a more radical, anti-capitalist way?

In a side question, the most feminist theory I read, the more I hate capitalism.

On the one hand, I know that this happens, and it sucks, and it needs to stop. On the other hand, I have literally NEVER been harassed in this way (this extreme a way -- being followed home, grabbed, etc. I've had a couple ""Hey baby""s in my day, but it never went any further that that). So it confuses me whenever the writers of these articles claim that ""it happens no matter where you are, what you're wearing, what you look like"", etc. Shouldn't it have happened to me at least once or twice then? With the frequency of the attacks described by these authors, I would expect this to be happening at least once every few months to me. Is it possible that I'm just extremely lucky? Or is there some component to this that we're not talking about -- traditional attractiveness is the first to come to mind? I'm not ugly but I'm not everyone's cup of tea either. But it doesn't seem like that should be a factor if street harassment is really all about power and intimidation. Shouldn't just being a woman be enough?

I'm a feminist, I hate the idea of this happening to women, I'm just genuinely confused about the universality of the experience that is often claimed in these articles. Has anyone else NOT been street harassed? If every woman on this subreddit has experienced things like this, I'm willing to believe I'm just incredibly lucky. Or does it actually happen more often in certain situations but that would weaken the argument (I'm willing to let it go if this being universal is what's necessary to make the experience respected by men and not dismissed as ""You should have worn more clothing"" or whatever).",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_zzs7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/zzs7p/can_we_talk_about_street_harassment/,

Here's my list, off the top of my head, very biased towards issues that concern me in the place that I live (USA):

- Paid maternity and paternity leave of significant duration for *all* employees (not just people working for companies with over 50 employees or whatever). 

- Subsidised daycare. 

- Full day public school. 

- Law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of parenthood status (only mothers are discriminated against, really, but no harm making the law gender-neutral)

- Enormously increased funding for public schools, *especially* in communities of color. 

- Free *good* healthcare for poor kids and parents. Make that for *everyone that needs it*, dammit. 

- Basic rights for illegal immigrants: healthcare, no racial profiling, schooling, minimum wage, OSHA. 

- Pensions/401k contributions and healthcare for unpaid caregivers. 

- QUILTBAG rights (marriage, adoption, assistance with transitioning for the T folk - for starters). 

- Ending the ""war on drugs"" and racial profiling in all preventive (though perhaps not investigative) policework, which causes people of color to be so disproportionately and unfairly imprisoned, devastating communities of color.

The list could go on for-fucking-ever. 

But at at the very least we could start with *passing the fucking equal rights amendment.* It simply reads: ""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex."" WHAT THE FUCK IS THE PROBLEM WITH PASSING IT. It's been 40 years!

Obvious throwaway here, but I really need to ask you something.

I'm a white American cisgender heterosexual male (naturally, aren't we all), and a few years ago, I became aware in my own small way of male privilege. Fast forward a few years with some WMST classes, some volunteer work with women's groups, and some beloved involvement on /SRS/. I graduated with my business Master's a couple years ago and finally got a job recently, building up money. But I'm unsatisfied, because...

After a lot of thought, I really feel that I want to spend and dedicate my life to feminism; to fighting privilege, the patriarchy, and sexism. But obviously, this is a huge leap, and there are a lot of concerns, mostly about my OWN privilege. I'm really posting this to try and see if going back to college to get my women's studies degree and hopefully be a professor or career activist is even something that would be possible, or most importantly, encouraged, to do. My concerns:

* I'll be a male in safe female spaces. There are some safe spaces males just shouldn't be in -- such as sexual assault victim forums. I am possibly a huge trigger.
* Male gaze. As a privileged male, my mere presence could change the safety level or the discussion, for fear of worrying to offend me.
* My own privilege. I cannot unmake my privilege. As long as this world is so fucked up, I'm always going to get a pass for being white and male. I'm worried this would hurt my own effectiveness or understanding, and I know I'll never really 100% be able to grasp the experience of being female and being oppressed from it and its intersections.
* My own privilege as it pertains to being an ally. I can't tell you how many times I've looked back mortified that in my WMST classes, I may have been speaking *for* women, not as an ally *about* them, especially when I felt passionate about something. My friends and professors loved me, but still -- if I were crossing the line, that would just make me fearfully livid. I don't want to risk that.
* The creep factor -- here I'll be, a male in my mid 20s in a classroom with a lot of younger female peers. I don't want to make some people feel uncomfortable (and they're totally justified in doing so -- we're in a patriarchal society and the world's full of creepers, as reddit effortlessly demonstrates).
* The poverty factor. If I did this, I'd use the money I've greedily saved in my prized jobbie to fund the education in the hopes of getting a position or becoming a professor -- but I'm effectively walking out on a comfortable lifestyle and a measure of security in this crapsack world. (Although it comes from doing something I don't particularly enjoy, which would be a worse life, perhaps.)
* The Europe factor -- I'm really worried about the direction the US is going in. It seems like basic social services are going to collapse if the nation keeps shifting to the right, and would like to relocate to one of the better European countries (though most are pretty much a step up from the US politically) and get my degree/become a professor, activist, etc. there. (Yes, doesn't that complicate it all to hell?)

Right now, I've still got my job in business; I'm still steadily saving up money for this in the future. But is this something even possible, given my identity and privilege? Is it even something that you would encourage, or at the very least condone? I can't answer these questions for myself. Any help is really, really appreciated, and please don't be afraid to be completely, utterly honest. The truth is with the oppressed, not with the privileged. Thanks for any help.

I am not demisexual (nor asexual), but I have tried, in this post, to present some writing by demisexual people explaining to sexuals/allosexuals** (I'm not entirely sure which is the correct term?) **what demisexuality is,** relying heavily on demisexualitymyths.tumblr.com. **I really hope that I'm not misrepresenting it, and I definitely welcome criticism/corrections from asexual people.**

**(If you don't know what asexuality is, you probably should read [this] (http://www.asexuality.org/home/overview.html) first.)**

**Bolding is all mine.**

&gt;In the past few weeks, it seems, demisexuality, asexuality and the asexual spectrum have gone from relative obscurity to being a frequent topic of conversation, at least on tumblr. The debate* that has arisen has raised the question of the validity of asexuality/grey-a/demisexuality as sexual orientations, as well as demisexual/grey-a people and aces are queer or merely appropriating queer identity. I have no comment on the former, because I do not feel the need to argue for the validity of my own identity for obvious reasons. With regard to the latter question, I do not offer an answer, however I do believe that it needs to be discussed. 

&gt;**The debate surrounding certain orientations along the ace spectrum and whether they can be considered queer is a worthwhile discussion, and a number of people on both sides of the debate have raised valid points. The discussion needs to take place. However, the problem I see with the discourse as it is happening now is that the main source of inspiration for the discussion was based on a lack of understanding of demisexuality.** So that leads me to my point which is: This discussion needs to happen, but it can and should happen without anger, hatred, accusations, or misinformation. A discussion on whether or not demisexual people, grey-a people, and aces should identify as queer can take place without hostility. The way to do this is to start communicating more clearly and to be sure that we all understand the terms we are using in the discussion, because the mis-use of the term demisexuality is getting us nowhere.

&gt;**A demisexual is a person who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with someone.** It's more commonly seen in but by no means confined to romantic relationships. The term demisexual comes from the orientation being ""halfway between"" sexual and asexual. Nevertheless, this term does not mean that demisexuals have an incomplete or half-sexuality, nor does it mean that sexual attraction without emotional connection is required for a complete sexuality. In general, demisexuals are not sexually attracted to anyone of any gender; however, when a demisexual is emotionally connected to someone else (whether the feelings are romantic love or deep friendship), the demisexual experiences sexual attraction and desire, but only towards the specific partner or partners.

&gt;When describing demisexuality as an orientation to sexuals, sexuals often mistake it as an admirable choice rather than an innate orientation. Demisexuals are not choosing to abstain; they simply lack sexual attraction until a close relationship is formed...

&gt;""Demisexual"" is also sometimes used as a synonym for some other kind of person falling under the gray-A umbrella. Demisexuality differs from gray-asexuality in that demisexuality is a specific sexual orientation in between ""sexual"" and ""asexual"", whereas ""gray-A"" is a highly unspecific catch-all used for anything between sexual and asexual that does not fit...

-http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=Demisexual

&gt;Demisexuality is the lack of sexual attraction unless an emotional connection is formed. It is on the asexual spectrum, because demisexual people are very similar to aces with regards to sexual attraction/desire outside of the context of emotional relationships that cause sexual attraction or desire in demisexual people. **Others had referred to demisexuality as being “asexual with exceptions,**” and while I find that a little problematic because it may make demisexuality seem arbitrary, it does accurately characterize the asexual nature of demisexuality which makes it easier to understand how it differs from “traditional sexuality”.

-http://demisexualitymyths.tumblr.com/post/27963858176/a-definition-of-demisexuality

&gt;**i think an easier way to define demisexuality for people who keep saying that demisexuals are just “being special snowflakes” and that “MOST PEOPLE only want to have sex with people they’re emotionally attached to!” is:**

&gt;**A demisexual is someone who is “basically” asexual except towards a specific person whom they have a strong bond with.** 

&gt;**most sexual people don’t have sex with everyone of their preference, obviously! but they still find others attractive.**

&gt;**and as a demisexual, i don’t. i hope that’s a lot simpler?**

http://vaggieblt.tumblr.com/post/28111394034/i-think-an-easier-way-to-define-demisexuality-for

&gt;&gt;Anonymous asked: You completely missed the point of why Demisexuality is slut-shaming and why people call it a special-snowflake syndrome. Because it assumes that everyone who does not call themselves Demisexual does not need emotional connection; that they'll just have sex with anyone regardless. Which is not true. It's very, very common for people to need that emotional connection before attraction, before sex, and there's no reason to need to feel included in a special category for something that is the norm.

&gt;**There is a difference between people who do not identify as demisexual “needing an emotional connection before sex” and a demisexual person. When I do not have an emotional connection with someone, I am functionally asexual. I feel nothing, I don’t even think sexually. That is why demisexuality is on the asexual spectrum. You are confusing sexual behavior with sexual orientation. I know that there are people out there who don’t identify on the asexual spectrum who don’t want to “just have sex with anyone regardless,” but the point is, they experience sexuality differently from demisexual people. A lot of demisexual people identify as asexual until they develop and emotional connection with someone and start feeling sexual attraction, which is how the term arose...Another thing about demisexuals, which I would say you don’t know, since you don’t seem to understand how demisexuality differs from “the norm” , which I hope to post about soon, is that even after an emotional connection is formed, there may not be sexual feelings.** Why, you ask? Because demisexuality, and I cannot say this enough, is on the asexual spectrum. So yeah, I could probably pass for an allosexual person, as far as relationships are concerned since it is close to the norm, except for the times that I don’t develop sexual attraction, because my orientation is on the asexual spectrum. Oh, wait, that wouldn’t be passing as allosexual now would it?

&gt;**I understand that you may have encountered people who don’t have a very good understanding of demisexuality that think it fits them because they simply don’t like sex outside of a relationship, and it really isn’t my job to police how other people identify, but demisexuality has nothing to do with like or not liking sex outside of a relationship, it is basically being asexual devoid of very particular contexts.**

&gt;I don’t know why I spent all that time and energy answering this, because obviously, I probably will not change this person’s mind. Thank you for telling me how I don’t understand my own sexual orientation though. Because your misrepresentation of it is means you understand it so much better than my own lived experience.

This one is not someone talking to sexual people, but just a description of her experience:

&gt;When I was 13 and going through puberty I never had any serious boyfriends, the thought of getting close to someone made me nervous.
I tried dating and when things got remotely physical I would feel sick, and creeped out.

&gt;I thought I was gay, for a while after that, and tried thinking about women, but rushing into that made me nervous still.

&gt;I was getting used to the idea I'd be alone forever. Then one day I met someone who I fell for, it was slow going and at first I thought he was kind of weird looking, but we had so much fun together and suddenly I was in love and I wanted him more than I had ever wanted anyone, but we spent so long taking it slow, by the time I realized I wanted him he was calling it off, and we broke up and wound up on and off being some weird cross between friends and being physically close.

&gt;For two years (and counting) I was not able to move past him, he was the only one I had ever gotten close to, and I was 22 years old and a virgin and really looking forward to having sex, and everyone kept telling me to find somebody else, as if it was THAT easy??

&gt;Tonight I learned what the word demisexual means, and I feel like I know myself for the first time, as cheesy as that sounds. It's not just that an emotional connection is important to having sex for me, it's VITAL. Otherwise I get disgusted by the idea of getting close to someone physically. 

&gt;I'm curious how people deal with this though? It's so rare for me to fall in love, I'm relieved to know what to call myself after so long not understanding what was wrong, everyone thought I was just being picky and I needed to get over it.

&gt;I mostly wanted to share my story, and just talk to someone who also identified as being demisexual. I really don't like having to label myself with an obscure title, but nothing has ever made so much sense to me. It's like it explains all of my romantic and sexual issues that I have ever had.

&gt;Myth 3: Demisexuality is appropriation of asexuality

&gt;Related to, but not quite the same as the myth that demisexuality is queer appropriation, which I may address in time, **I have heard people, always outside of the asexual community, claim that demisexuality is appropriation of the asexual identity. This is relatively easy to address, because demisexuality is recognized by the asexual community as part of the asexual community. It is an accepted part of the asexual spectrum and everyone within the asexual community acknowledges that.**

&gt;That is really all I need to say to settle this one, but given that the people saying this are not part of the asexual community I would like to just say that **if you are not a member of asexual community, it is inherently problematic to say that certain members of acommunity you do not belong to should not recognize other members of the same community you do not belong to  because you think they are appropriating an identity you have nothing invested in. In short, you are saying that you know better than the asexual community how it should conduct itself and what it should and should not recognize.**

&gt;Under the Ace Umbrella: Demisexuality and Gray-asexuality
Posted on June 16, 2012

&gt;*I’ve heard about something called the “Ace Umbrella”.  What’s that about?*

&gt;There’s a gray area between asexuality and non-asexuality.  Some people say that they occasionally experience sexual attraction, yet still relate to asexuality.  The ace umbrella encompasses asexuals, as well as people in this gray area.

&gt;Some people, known as “gray-asexuals”, experience sexual attraction infrequently or not very strongly or possibly aren’t quite sure whether or not what they experience is sexual attraction.

&gt;One subtype of gray-asexuals, known as “demisexuals”, can experience sexual attraction only after developing a close emotional bond with someone.

&gt;***So, if asexuals don’t experience sexual attraction and these people do, why the “umbrella”?  What do you have in common?***

&gt;**Many graces and demis tend to feel alienated by or disconnected from the sex-charged culture that they see around them.  Most of the time, they do not experience sexual attraction, same as asexual people.  When they do, the manner or frequency with which they do does not align with how “everyone else” describes their experience with sexual attraction.  In this way, their experiences are often very similar to the experiences of asexuals.**

&gt;**Many times, demisexuals and gray-asexuals will even identify as asexual or something like “asexual with an exception”.  The frequency of sexual attraction may be so low that they go years without feeling it, so, for all intents and purposes, they are equivalent to asexual during that period.**

&gt;***But isn’t that just “Normal” sexuality?  Most people aren’t attracted to everyone all the time.***

&gt;Certainly, most people don’t feel constant sexual attraction.  However, most people seem to feel it fairly frequently.  Often it’s toward a romantic partner, but throughout the day, there might also be the hot co-worker or the random stranger on the sidewalk or the celebrity with the great body.  Even if most people don’t act on it, the attraction is still present.  Grays and demis aren’t like that.  **For a gray-asexual or a demisexual, there may be years between episodes of sexual attraction or there may have been only one person that’s ever caught their eye.**

&gt;*It sounds like demisexuals are trying to make themselves out to be special because they only have sex with people they love.*

&gt;Demisexuality is about attraction, not action.  It doesn’t mean that people are picky about their sexual partners.  It doesn’t mean that they’re “saving themselves for the right person”. When someone says that they’re demi, they mean that they can’t experience sexual attraction unless they’re close to someone.  They’re not choosing to repress sexual feelings for others because they don’t have anything to repress.

&gt;Furthermore, demisexuality says nothing about who a demi has sex with, or if they even have sex at all.  It’s possible to be demisexual and a virgin.  It’s possible to be demisexual and repulsed.  And it’s possible to be demisexual and sleep with anyone who is willing.  Demisexuality is only about the circumstances where one can experience sexual attraction, not about sexual activity.

&gt;It’s also important to note that demisexuality is not, in any way, a value judgment against other people.  Just because they only experience sexual attraction after developing an emotional bond, that does not mean that they feel there’s anything wrong with people who don’t require that bond to experience sexual attraction.

&gt;*Okay, so they’re only sexually attracted to people that they love?*

&gt;Not necessarily.  The close emotional bond does not have to be love.  It could be friendship, it could be a work relationship, or any number of other strong emotional connections.  Something purely platonic might still be capable of triggering sexual attraction.

&gt;*Are gray-a’s just asexuals who have sex?*

&gt;It’s not about what someone does, it’s about what they feel.  If an asexual has sex, they’re an asexual who has sex, not a gray-asexual.  If an asexual masturbates, they’re an asexual who masturbates, not a gray-asexual.  The difference between “asexual” and “gray-asexual” is one of attraction, not behavior.

&gt;It’s not about enjoying sex, either.  If an asexual likes sex, they’re an asexual who likes sex, not a gray-asexual. It’s possible to enjoy sex and sexual activities and not experience sexual attraction.

&gt;*How can someone be “Gray”?  You’re either asexual or you’re not.  Clear as that.*

&gt;Is it clear where you fit if you’ve only felt sexual attraction once in your entire life, then never again?  Is it clear where you fit if you occasionally feel something that could potentially be sexual attraction, but it’s so weak that a passing breeze is enough to make it stop?  Is it clear where you fit if you’re sometimes sexually attracted to people and you like sex, but don’t feel any drive to seek it out and would be fine without it?  Is it clear where you fit if you’re not sure what sexual attraction even is, let alone whether or not you’ve felt it?  Gray-asexuals live in this land of confusion.

&gt;*So what is gray-asexuality, then?  The description you’re giving is a bit fuzzy.*

&gt;**The definition of “gray-asexual” is intentionally vague.  It’s meant to be a catch-all for anyone who feels they fall somewhere near asexual on the spectrum between “sexual” and “asexual”.  There’s no strict criteria for what makes someone “gray”, there’s no shining dividing line.  If there were, it wouldn’t be a gray area.**

&gt;*How can you know you’re demi or gray and not asexual?*

&gt;Well, if you experience sexual attraction occasionally, that’s a pretty good sign that you’re not asexual.

&gt;Aside from that, if you feel like you’re almost asexual, but not quite for some reason, then perhaps gray-asexual would be a better fit.  If you’re asexual most of the time, but there’s that one person you’re close to who’s an exception, then maybe demisexual would work.

&gt;*How can you know you’re asexual and not demi or gray?*

&gt;If you don’t feel like you’re demi or gray, then you’re not.  There’s no 100% surefire way to determine that just because you’ve never experienced sexual attraction before, that you won’t tomorrow.  You can be fairly sure that it’s not going to happen if it’s never happened before, but it can’t be ruled out completely.  It’s a bit like a scientific theory:  It can never be proven entirely, it can only be disproven.  After all, everyone who has experienced sexual attraction had a first time, and they probably weren’t expecting it to happen, either.

&gt;Look at it this way:  There are plenty of straight people in the world.  Most of them have never been attracted to a member of the same sex.  But how can they know for sure that they won’t be?  How can they be certain they don’t have dormant bisexual tendencies?  The common response is “Well, I just know“, but really, it’s impossible to know for sure.  It’s not something that stresses out a lot of straight people, yet I see a lot of aces worried that they might really be gray or demi.

&gt;For me, I’m asexual.  I don’t expect that it’ll turn out that I’m actually gray or demi, but if it does, I’m not going to push it away.  If I happen to experience sexual attraction one day, then okay, I’ve learned that I’m not asexual after all.  I’m not going to let this word that describes me very well right now tell me what to do in the future.  You’re not permanently locked into asexuality for the rest of your life once you’ve used the word to describe yourself, so if it no longer fits, don’t try to make it fit.

""The test, which included push-ups, sit-ups, and a 300-meter and 1.5-mile run, had identical cut-off scores for men and women. But between 2005 and 2009, only 19 percent of the female applicants who took the test passed it, compared with 63 percent of the male applicants, according to the Justice Department.""

A police officer needs strength and speed to properly do there job as in some cases it could literally be a matter of life and death. How is removing the test or lowering the standards for woman justified when male and female cops are facing the same threats?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for posting,I think over all this was a great discussion. I would like to respond to some of your comments but I have been banned from srsdiscussion. Before I go into exile I would like to leave with a final thought. its extremely important to have more white and black female cops because the way that female police officers do there job it has been proven by the department of justice to reduce the number of cases of excessive use of force.Female cops usually do there jobs in a community oriented style. I believe the way female police officers do there job should be  monitored and from what we learn from watching them, teach it in police academies. With more female police officers and more cops trained in community oriented style of policing I  believe the cases of police brutality would go down dramatically. More black female officers would be EXCELLENT news for blacks who are four times more likely to have excessive force used against them. Woman who want to be police officers should be given more training to be able to meet the fitness requirements. Being a police officer is just to much of a dangerous job to lower the physical requirements.

Again thank You all

I am a long-time lurker and I have a question. I'll provide some background but for anyone who just wants to jump in there'll be a tl;dr afterward. 

It is only recently that I have become more aware of the privilege that I have. I am a queer (I identify as queer but for full disclosure I am attracted to both men and women) Latino (white-skinned) cis male. I am now 23 and for the longest time I was unconvinced that I had privilege as a cis male even though I was aware that others had privilege over me for being non-latino and straight. I am really ashamed now by how long it took me to realize my own privilege. For background I was one of those people that honestly thought ""feminism"" was dishonest for not being ""gender-inclusive"" (though never to the extent of an MRA). I did largely accept that the reason for any ""slights"" (minor though they are) against men was because of the established patriarchy. I did not believe feminism was ""against men"" or anything, only that they did not make an effort to include men. 

Again, this was a few years ago this is not what I believe now. And it's exactly because I have only (in the past few months) been realizing how wrong I was on issues in the past that I am asking this question.

A few years ago my girlfriend (a rather knowledgable feminist) and I were talking about homophobia and she claimed that homophobia is a result of institutionalized misogyny in the patriarchy. Essentially, homophobia was due to a hatred of women. I am trying to paraphrase her as best as I remember but please understand my first inclination was to get very upset so I might have details wrong. Essentially she claimed that it was considered abhorrent for men to ""act like women"" in the patriarchy so it is not so much a hatred of homosexuality as it is a hatred of women that is the result of homophobia. I believe she mentioned this was part of the reason lesbian cis women seem to get ""less flack"" (please excuse me if my language seems at all to be diminishing the plight or hardships of anyone) in society than gay cis men. 

At the time I was very upset and I accused her of trying to appropriate the oppression of others under a woman-centric umbrella. 

However, seeing as how I've only just begun to realize how man-centric all of my ideas of oppression were I am wondering whether or not there is any evidence of what she said being true. 

TL;DR Can anyone more learned in the subject than me please tell me if there is any evidence/studies that show that homophobia is inextricably linked to misogyny? I would love to read any essays on the matter as well.

Is the idea of treating men like sex objects problematic to the cause(s) of feminism. As a heterosexual, cisgender female, I often find myself ""objectifying"" men in the way that I think men ""objectify"" women. This is not to say that I can't respect the ideas, opinions, and intellect of men. I think as people (regardless of sexuality or gender) we all ""sexualize"" one another to a certain extent as sex is such an integral part of the human experience. IMHO, the sexuality of ALL people should be openly acknowledged.

However, I have heard the argument that sexualizing men is only making the problem worse. By doing this, by supporting this, I am only adding to an overall ""problem"" in society of treating people as simply a ""body"".
Thoughts?

EDIT: Thanks for the discussion, everyone! I just have a few more questions.

1) In my opinion, the best argument I've heard about why sexualizing men is NOT harmful is that it doesn't ""take away"" anything from men due to the depth of male privilege. What do you think it would take for women to be in a similar place? I'm not saying we should start treating men the same way as women. I'm just wondering if we could live in a society where Christina Hendricks, Tina Fey, and Katherine Heigl can be seen as talented women who just HAPPEN to be conventionally attractive. Conversely, I am not saying we need to scrutinize male supreme court justices for their lack of sex appeal. What would it take in order for people to be acknowledged for their accomplishments while at the same time not ignoring sex and sexuality?

2) The main argument I have heard against the sexualization of men is essentially that two wrongs don't make a right. This is where my moral dilemma with this subject lies. I think sexuality is a perfectly natural, healthy thing however, I hate the ""eye for an eye"" rationale when it comes to these types of situations. It is exactly the kind of rationale used to justify war and other human atrocities.  How can people reconcile natural sexual urges with the kind of harmful sexualization in society?

And I guess my main question is....

3)How can we use human sexuality for a force of GOOD?",,False,,t5_2t5sa,True,,,True,t3_ro0o8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/ro0o8/sexualizing_men_problematic/,

This does make sense to me, but I wonder a little bit on where the line is drawn. I am a gynophilic cis male who is in a relationship with a pre-operative transsexual woman. Is somebody like me allowed in a queer safe space or not?

On one hand, I see the argument for no. Being attracted to a trans woman does not make me gay and does not make me queer, so why would I belong there? Especially since I can easily talk about having a girlfriend and nobody thinks anything about it, I can also go out in public with her and people will see us as a normal couple.

On the other hand, I do think there's an argument for yes. The general public does see this as a homosexual, or possibly bisexual, attraction and that does put me in the queer community. I am not able to freely talk about my relationship with the same openness and acceptance I would be able to if my partner was born with a vagina.

**WHY ISRAEL? - A VERY SHORT INTRODUCTION**


**1. What was the Holocaust?**

The Holocaust, or the Shoah, as some people call it, was the industrial murder of about six million Jews in Germany and its occupied territories. 

**2. How is the Holocaust differ from other genocides?**

Germany was not a primitive state during the mass murders. It was highly industrialized and its people were well educated compared to other nations. Still, the whole nation was mobilized to either actively support or actively ignore the murders. The genocide itself was highly irrational, but its execution was executed with precise plans that ensured a high grade of perfection and efficiency. Massive amounts of work and money were put into the industrialized murder factories. 
The mass-murder of the european jews was not an act against political enemies. Other regimes have murdered a lot of political opponents or ""foreigners"", but jews were well integrated into the German society. Many fought on the frontlines of World War One, many were patriots. They were murdered because they were jews, not because they were political enemies. More on this later. 

**3. What is Antisemitism?**

Generally speaking, Antisemitism is 	resentment, hatred towards, or suspicion of jewish People. Antisemitism is different from ""conventional"" forms of racism. ""Blacks"", ""Asians"", ""Indians"" and other minorities are generally looked down upon, they are given attributes such as ""lazy"", ""poor"", ""violent"", ""criminal"", ""dirty"", ""smelly"",… And the own race is seen as a superior, better, more advanced race. 
A common Anti-Semitic view on the other hand paints a picture of a powerful executive who controls the media, politics, the financial sector and more, who acts in the background, hidden from the public eye. It is an attempt to explain of how the world worksAn important aspect is the fact that, in an antisemitic worldview, jewish influence traverses borders, races and ideology. For example, anti-Semites argue that ""the Jews"" are responsible for both the negative aspects capitalism and the totalitarian communist regimes. (""jewish bolshevism"" and ""greedy jewish bankers""). In fact, the relation between a false analysis of capitalism and its outcomes and antisemitism is crucial to understanding it. To put it (extremely) shortly: In an antisemitic worldview, ""the jews"" are responsible for all negative outcomes of capitalism. In fact, the power of capitalism does** not lie in the hands of an elite group of people, but in the system itself. Humans, however, want to personalize structural phenomenons. Marx calls this ""reification"". In the antisemitic ideology, this personalization reflects the (structurally caused) outcomes of capitalism on ""jews"". While ""true"" labour (such as building something) is viewed as good (or ""german"" by the nazis), labour which seems more abstract (the financial sector) is viewed as ""jewish"". This denies the fact that even ""true"" labour is abstract labour in a capitalist world (Everybody should read some Marx, by the way).
The eliminatory element of antisemitism (which was realized in Auschwitz) lies within this aspect: It is the will to eliminate the personification of an abstract power.

**4. Alright, alright… But what does this have to do with Israel?**

The will to create a safe-space for jews is older than the Holocaust. But, after the genocide, more and more people realized that continuing to rely on the goodwill of governments and societies was no longer an option. Antisemitism is still a huge problem today and there are many who still wish for an ""extermination"" of all jews.

**5. But the jews stole land from Palestine!**
First of all, Palestine was not a nation at that point. The area ""Palestine"" was ruled by the turkish empire until after WW2 it fell under a British mandate. In fact, a lot of the land that is now in Israel was simply bought by jewish refugees. 
 The United Nations then decided to create a jewish safespace in the area, next to a palestinian state. This could have been the end of the conflict. But only one day after the founding of Israel, all of its neighbors started a war against the newly founded state.

**7. But Israel deported and expelled all the Arabs from Israel!**

While there were some violent attempts to drive arabs out of the Israel, many simply fled because of the war. Some nations also actively tried to scare arabs away from Israel, claiming that there were mass murders of arabs. Many also fled believing that after a few days, the new state would be destroyed and they would be able to return.

**8. But today the Arabs don't have any rights in Israel! It's an apartheid state!**

In the Israeli parliament (The Knesset), The ""United Arab List"", an islamistic, anti-zionist party has 13 seats (out of 120). The Arab population is about 20%. 

**9. Yeah, Yeah, but the orthodox Jews oppress women, there is racism in Israel, there is hatred towards arabs,…**

This is all true. It's not wrong to point out these aspects. The problem begins when people start using a double standard when it comes to criticizing Israeli politics. For example: While people are outraged by orthodox Jews demanding women to wear certain clothes, they remain silent when it comes to the situation of women in muslim countries in the area. People are outraged by the situation in the West bank, but know nothing about morocco's politics in the west sahara. It's not antisemitic to criticize some aspects of Israeli politics. It is antisemitic to pretend that only Israel does such things and to use a different standard when evaluating Israeli politics.

**10. What about the wall in Gaza?**

The wall was build as a reaction to suicide bombings in Israel and the large numbers of weapons that were smuggled into Israel. After its erection, the number of attacks decreased greatly. 

**11. What does all this have to do with the Iran?**

The Iranian regime (That many, many, many Iranians oppose) is extremely antisemitic. Ahmadinedjad's speeches are examples of eliminatory antisemitism at its worst. This guy wants to destroy Israel. And he wants nuclear weapons. Eliminatory antisemitsim and nuclear weapons within the range of Israel? Not good. This is why we should all support the Iranian people's struggle to bring his regime down.

I mean, I always realized that MRAs were constantly hanging out there; often posts were covered with MRA opinions and all the feminist ones are downvoted.

But now, it's like gone a whole level beyond. It's like the MRAs have been so successful at concern trolling that a fair number of the ""feminists"" there *are* MRAs.

Case in point: user [posts acting like they doesn't know the difference between /r/feminism and /r/feminisms](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/pagnv/hey_just_a_simple_question_is_there_a_difference/). Of course, if you read the comments, you know that the user already has their mind made up that [/r/feminisms](/r/feminisms) is the ""close-minded one"" and that the fact that it is larger ""speaks terribly for the movement of equality."" This post is currently **number 6** under what's hot on the subreddit.

But wait, there's more: same user's first post on [/r/feminism](/r/feminism) was a [survey about men's rights](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ohlql/rfeminism_i_am_tired_of_reading_stereotypes_and/)!

You post [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/p15pz/a_certain_subreddit_defends_their_right_to_invade/) about a post on /r/MR. Who replies first? An MRA, saying ""Interesting....seemed to be a lot of valid points."" Not, ""I'm an MRA, and I think..."" but actually acting as if we're unrelated to the movement.

My point here isn't that we should try to save /r/feminism; it's just that I think there is a lesson to be learned here about what MRAs will do if they aren't ""censored"" outright. They may complain that SRS and [/r/feminisms](/r/feminisms) are anti-free speech, but being against free speech is a hell of a lot better than being infiltrated using an embrace, extend, extinguish method to the point where legitimate discussion is impossible.

Since the link pretty much covers most of the terminology I want to go over stuff like obsession with loli and the consequences. While I never got into the whole loli thing other than holy shit that's cute I do understand there are various things from it ranging from romance related to sexual fetishes (IE hentai). This has gone to the point where many characters in anime look far younger than they should compared to their real age. However while I don't approve, I think it's truly different from CP in the sense that it's really a victimless crime. No child was hurt in the creation of such material as it's all 2D images. 

An argument that is brought up often to counter is that it encourages dangerous thought patterns and just helps to cultivate certain feelings. I would like to have a source on that if possible. 

Another argument I heard is that such material can be good as an outlet for certain people and that it's better that they work it out on a 2D character rather than on a real life child. Or that what one feels for a 2D character is just completely different to how one views real life people. 

What do people think? Is loli truly victimless? Should they be treated the shame way as CP? Or is it not as dangerous/wrong but something not to be encouraged and discouraged if possible?

We're both 25 years old, both in grad school, but our differences really do diverge once you hit that point. 

Suffice it to say, he's a manchild, and let me put this in context by giving you examples before getting to the meat of this post: 

* He spends many hours a day playing video games, in fact he spends quite a bit of money on additions for his Xbox, games, and maintaining his giant flat screen TV. Just imagine Seth Rogan's apartment from 40 Year Old Virgin, where he lives in a place that looks like pigshit, but there's a $900 TV and tons of video games. I try to keep the place nice but there's only so much I can do. I've actually heard him say to a friend of ours who just got engaged, ""Yeah it's nice to have a girlfriend cuz someone's there to clean up and cook.""

* He has a subscription to Playboy, and you might think, ""Well having a subscription to Playboy seems harmless, right?"" (Or maybe you aren't thinking that). But here's the thing, he also wantonly watches hardcore pornography in the living room. In fact, one time he and another guy had hooked up a laptop to the TV and were watching hardcore porn in the living room... This made me feel *extremely* uncomfortable, and I made my discomfort pretty explicit and just nervously laughed it off saying, ""yeah...that's pretty cool :-\"" and since then he's done *that* sort of thing much less often, but one thing that hasn't stopped are his rampant backwards views on women, which brings me to the Raison d'être of this post. 

My roommate isn't a dumb guy, but he's definitely your typical SAWCSM (sorry if I didn't type that right, I'm not super familiar with a lot of the Gender Theory terms etc). Aside from working on his masters degree, video games and eating, all he does is watch football. And not *sports* mind you, I literally mean *just football*. And like many guys who are huge consumers of football in America, he's bombarded with these crazy backwards and dangerous views on sex and gender roles. I'm sort of a ""typical guy"" too, and I love football, but any person critically watching the sport, the barrage of sexist ads, etc has to disgust you at some point no matter what gender you are. But I digress..

Things my roommate does/says on a regular basis when we're watching football:

* Constant judging of the cheerleaders: 

""Ugh, Arkansas St has some ugly fucken bitches for cheerleaders""

""Wooh, look at those tits, I wish all women on TV looked like that""

* Disturbing sexist/hateful remarks about the sideline reporters (who in football are usually women), or team owners:

""Thanks a lot Erin Andrews, that was insightful, women sure do know football /sarcasm""

""Did you know some famous singer is a shareholder for the Dallas Cowboys? No wonder they suck now, I'm sorry but stupid cunts should have nothing to do with football"". 

* General hateful/sexist comments

""Way to go _____, you're just gonna lose, you're gonna just lie down and take it like a woman!""

These are not exaggerations or anything by the way, he actually said these things.

And these aren't isolated incidents, it's constant. Shit, I'm disappointed in myself for not remembering more of them. Generally he only views women as sex objects, and can only relate to women through sexualizing them. All in all this creates a bothersome situation for me because I don't know how to tell him that a lot of the shit he does and thinks is damaging to himself and society in general. The worst part is that for a guy like me, generally it isn't accepted socially to come out against hyper-masculine behavior or against bashing women like this, or being critical of pornography, because then it's assumed that you're gay, and that's definitely unacceptable (btw: I can't even count how many times he has made horrible homophobic remarks). Getting back to that, it's funny to me how acceptable it is now for every guy in the world to be watching hardcore porn that if you are a straight guy who basically says, ""You know, I don't watch porn"" or ""I really don't like that stuff"" you'll be attacked. I've definitely been made fun of for it, which just seems odd to me. I don't even understand why someone would bring up porn sites in regular conversation, that shit is creepy, right?*** That sort of thinking really seems to inform my roommate's actions, I don't know how to break it. What would y'all do?

tl;dr - My roommate is a sexist manchild, I don't know what to do, or is he a lost cause?

EDIT: ***I'm actually reminded now of another story of my roommate. We were eating breakfast with a few friends from out of town, and my roommate asks a guy from Toronto if people really have sex outdoors. My Toronto friend was confused, and my roommate goes, ""Oh well you know I saw these videos on YouPorn of people having sex in public places"" and I was god damn speechless.

[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913000020)

Down in the comments, I found another pretty shocking link. A twitter account called heightism watch that basically compiles a list of tweets hating on short men. [Link](https://twitter.com/heightismwatch)

Some examples:

* I simply do not trust short men.

* Short men brings out a short fuse with me. They got the nerve to be confident.

* Right! Short guys should just be banned from earth.

* Men under 5""10 what is ur purpose on earth lmao

* Too many short men in the world, us tall folks need to breed so our children never have to experience this.

* Short ""men"" should be exterminated... They serve no purpose

* guys under 5'10"" should be executed

I just randomly picked those, the rest of them contain the same amount of awful. 

While most of them tended to just be strait up hate tweets with no substance, I found a couple of them suggesting that the discrimination against short men had misogynistic and homophobic connotations.

Examples:

* Short men might as well be penisless in my eyes

* You short men might as well take dick.

* Short guys are a waste of a penis *sigh* might as well be a girl

Although in the hundreds that were present, those types of tweets were pretty rare so I'm not sure if that theory holds much water. Many of them cited manners, inferiority, and unattractiveness. 

So, any explanation for this? Does it stem from gender roles and how men are expected to be bigger, some other type of cultural phenomenon that I'm not aware of, or does EvoPsych (HISSSS) take the cake on this one? I've heard that taller women also get discriminated against but I haven't seen such extreme examples of that (though I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it existed)

Some have said that *Key &amp; Peele* is a product for white people to laugh at ""how silly black people are"" and confirm and support racist stereotypes, something that Dave Chappelle had feared. At least to myself, I feel like Key and Peele constantly try to point out the fact they're only ""half-black"" (both had Caucasian mothers), and this might bring up the issue of internalized racism and self-hate.

I allow my students to choose their own topics for research and writing, and the vast majority of them choose interesting and fruitful topics. However, every now and then, I will get one student who wants to write an anti-gay-marriage paper, and I'm always at a bit of a loss as to how to deal with this.

My usual tactic is to remind these students that they are required to write for a diverse audience, and therefore arguments based on their personal religious beliefs will not be successful. This usually works because their reasons for being against gay marriage stem from their religious upbringing. However, I'm not entirely happy with this method because it feels like a cop-out-- the truth is that these students are trying to get college credit for regurgitating hate speech, and I find the idea just as repulsive as if they wanted to write papers defending institutional racism or sexism. Of course, I'm hesitant to actually say this, as a student could easily see this as religious intolerance on my part and decide to complain to the department chair. I know it's horribly selfish of me to value my job security over the opportunity to open up a dialogue with my students about LGBTQ rights, but teaching jobs in the humanities aren't exactly easy to come by right now.

1351478416.0,26,self.SRSDiscussion,1295du,"When non-trans* folks cross-dress for costumes (Halloween or other), is it problematic? Are there exceptions? Is Rocky Horror Picture Show problematic? ",ohsideSHOWbob,41,15,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1295du/when_nontrans_folks_crossdress_for_costumes/,"Privilege check: I'm a cisgender &amp; cissexual female. If I get any language wrong please call me out. I realize there are a lot of trans* resources going around right now but haven't seen this particular topic addressed yet, but if it's redundant let me know. 

Background which brought up this question: 
So last week I was at a kink meetup on my campus. This group is made up of a mix of single people &amp; couples, and while the community has lots of GSM's, on this particular night there were mostly people who are either cisgender or genderqueer but physically present as cis all or nearly all of the time in public. However there was one trans* woman, I knew who she was through Fetlife (kink social website) but had never met her in person. Through Fet I knew she had started physically presenting as female in the past 6-9 months, and she is active at our queer center. 

The group started talking about Halloween plans and I mentioned that Rocky Horror Picture Show was going to be shadowcasted at the movie theatre over the weekend, and suggested we should get a group together. RHPS does two nights, Saturday night being Halloween costume theme, and Friday night as ""Tacky Horror,"" aka drag night where you are encouraged to cross-dress. I called it the ""gender bender"" night (I couldn't remember their official name for it.) I mentioned I was thinking of going as Danny from Grease as my housemate (cis female) was going to be Sandy. 

This conversation went on for 5-7 minutes or so and then the subject naturally shifted. The woman I mentioned earlier left really soon after that, with a quick goodbye, even though the group wasn't scheduled to end for another 30-45 minutes. I then realized I had noticed some uncomfortable body language from her during the discussion (tapping and wiggling her foot constantly). I was immediately embarrassed, did I make her uncomfortable or trivialize her with this topic? I wanted to message her to ask but didn't really know how to say it without projecting. (Would I make it more awkward by assuming she was offended just because she is trans*? I didn't use any slurs but looking back realize that the entire conversation was possibly problematic even if I wasn't being bigoted.)

Today the campus queer center sent out an email and it had something wonderful in it. Everyone is probably familiar with the [""We are a Culture, not a Costume""](http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/26/living/halloween-ethnic-costumes/index.html) campaign. Well, this woman and her colleagues at the Queer Center came up with their own poster: [""Our gender identity is not a costume.""](http://imgur.com/NhlNN) I am both inspired and impressed by her candidness and patience in doing this educational campaign, and also still embarrassed as I haven't reached out to her yet to apologize (and I still don't know how to word my apology.) I also have some unresolved questions about cross-dressing on Halloween, which is where SRSD may want to chime in. 

First, any suggestions on how to apologize (beyond just ""I'm sorry?"") Should I ask if I made her uncomfortable or just assume that I did and go from there? 

Second, let's talk about cross-dressing on Halloween. The example in the poster is obviously transphobic and sexist. My opinion: costumes which stereotype a gender, sex, or sexual identity and play it for laughs are fucked up and deserve to be called out. But is this always the case? What about women who cosplay as male characters at conventions? What if a man dresses as a specific female character (a male-presenting person was dressed as Minnie Mouse at a party this weekend)? Is Rocky Horror Picture Show transphobic (as Tim Curry is not really trans*) and harmful, or can it be done in a non-harmful way? 

Are there ever times where cross-dressing when you are not trans* or GQ is acceptable or is it always transphobic? ",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_1295du,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/1295du/when_nontrans_folks_crossdress_for_costumes/,

Hey, so I started the day with that link over in SRS proper on that PAX panel on women &amp; video gaming, which lead me to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiZgogBYPtM) (kinda uneventful) panel on trans genderism and video games.

It got me thinking all day about a theme that I keep running against - certain people belonging to GSM/feminine communities gravitating towards different compass points in nerd culture, especially in the tech, gaming, and science fiction fields pre-2000s.  I don't have concrete proof that there is a strong correlation between the two, but I keep running across intersectional landmarks, such as this [Reason article](http://reason.com/archives/2005/06/09/american-anarchist/1) (first paragraph) on an Anarchist New Left lesbian who was an early pioneer of Star Trek fan fiction, the heavy women presence in early [Star Trek conventions](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/galleries/2009/05/06/photos-rare-snapshots-from-early-star-trek-conventions.html), trans gendered person Rebecca Heineman's statements in the aforelinked trans~ &amp; video games panel about the early days of video/table top gaming (along with her statements about the attraction of trans~ individuals to the tech industry and my own vague recollections of other stories of trans* individuals involved in early phreaking/hacking/late 20th Century computer science communities), Russell T Davies's queer/nerd intersection narratives in Queer as Folk/Doctor Who, interviews with the RZA who stated as a teenage he looked to Asian empowerment in Hong Kong nüwave/Kung-fu cinema as an catharsis for the black experience, slash fiction &amp; yaoi (which, admittedly, seems to be written by or aimed towards straight women), and the pretty explicit GSM fandom of Xena/Star Trek TGN/Buffy.  Not to mention my own observations of GSM/female-identifying/autistic spectrum/differently abled friends' inclination towards fandom. 

It made me think that nerd culture, to a certain extent, is used as a ""safe space"" for marginalized identities, especially white GSM/feminine identities.  

But then the flip of that (and as demonstrated in Reddit) is that nerd culture has a propensity for ""whiteness,"" homophobia, and transphobia. When I first posted at SRS someone [linked to me](http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/bucholtz/articles/MB_JLA2001.pdf) this study that argued (quite persuasively) that nerd communes have a tendency to accentuate ""whiteness"" and to exclude those in marginalized communities.  

To make matters worse, I feel as if ""nerd culture as a safe space"" is quickly becoming an artifact of the 20st Century as in our current age  nerd culture is becoming normalized/commodified at the expense/expulsion/erasure of GSM, racial &amp; femmine perspectives.  Examples of this include Reddit itself, where the metrics of communication favor simulatanitously the marginalized/denominator ""nerd"" culture and marginalize those from ""non-normative"" perspectives.  Another example is from commodified ""nerd artifacts"" best exemplified in the 2009 film ""Star Trek"" in which the slightly progressive-minded platform of Star Trek series erases any type of progressive narratives in favor for aggressively misogynistic, [hetronormative](http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-trek/star-trek-09/) (link's in reference to RLM's argument that each character has a case of the ""not gays"") narratives.

I think the point of this drunken post is just start a discussion on your thoughts on the intersections between nerd culture &amp; marginalized communities, especially GSM/feminine identities. 

Questions to spur discussion; 

* How has the nerd community - especially reddit, but not exclusively - marginalized you?

* If you you feel that you have aspects of your identity that are marginalized, has sections of the nerd community provided an inclusive outlet?  If so, how?
* What first attracted you to Reddit - a nerd community?
* What are your thoughts on the SRS community (including the 1000 affiliated subreddits we have created) as an outlet for the marginalized...which can only exist because of the container of Reddit - a nerd culture artifact.
* Do you agree/disagree with my sentiment that ""nerd communities"" are ad hoc ""safe communities"" for marginalized persons, if so - why? 
* Do you have any other observations to add about the intersection between marginalized and nerd communities? Tell us what is your experience.
* I'm really drunk and want to stay drunk.  Five days ago, the woman I'm dating left in my fridge a $5 craft beer we got from Total Wine that she bought.  Should I drink it to stay drunk, or should I remind her later this week that she still has the beer in my fridge so she could enjoy it?

1327527943.0,27,self.SRSDiscussion,owmay,Trigger Warnings: some questions for the community.,,35,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/owmay/trigger_warnings_some_questions_for_the_community/,"A [trigger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger) is a word, phrase, or piece of media that elicits a traumatic memory in someone who has experienced a trauma. When triggered, a survivor of trauma feels as though they are experiencing and responding to the traumatic event in their past, and may [even experience an anxiety or panic attack.](http://nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/complete-index.shtml). 

For this reason, it is considered kind in online discussion - especially in safe spaces, such as /r/SRSDiscussion - of serious issues to include **trigger warnings** in your post in order for your readers who happen to be survivors to avoid being triggered. Such trigger warnings not only prevent survivors from being triggered, they also validate survivors of trauma, by recognizing their existence, showing sensitivity to their needs, and allowing them the choice to then view the content or not. 

I think that we all generally agree that as a good faith service to each other, we should use trigger warnings. However, I have some questions about how we are doing this, and thought it was appropriate that we discuss this as a community. 

1. When do you include a trigger warning?  I realize it is prudent to include a trigger warning whenever you include *an explicit description of a traumatic event* in a submission or comment, but what about words or phrases? 

2. On Reddit, trigger warnings tend to go in the titles of posts. When commenting, however, where should they go? How about when linking to a piece of media - should they go in the link itself, or before the link?

3. I have also noticed that many consider it helpful when composing a trigger warning to include *why* the content is triggering. Is that not triggeing, in and of itself? A trigger warning should generally look like this: **Trigger Warning: Childhood Abuse**, right? 

4. It is difficult to anticipate many triggers, and basically anything can trigger someone's PTSD and cause panic/anxiety attacks. With that in mind, what types of trauma are we tagging posts for? 

 **Examples of topics that may require trigger warnings:**

&gt; - threats of death or violence.
&gt; - assault.
- stalking or harassment.
- rape culture
- sexual assault/abuse.
- domestic violence
- suicide.
- suicidal ideation.
- self-injury or self-mutilation.
- child sexual assault/abuse.
- incest.
- common phobias, such as spiders, vomit, or blood.
- genocide.
- fat-shaming
- abortion
- eating disorders, including ""thinsporation"", how many calories are in an item of food, etc.
- OCD, (for example, saying something is ""contaminated"" can catalyze intrusive thoughts. 

This list is pretty broad. Which of these qualify? Can we agree on some common triggers?

5. I have noticed that some SRS users are utilizing a **system of abbreviations** that look like this:

&gt; - TW - General trigger warning. 

&gt; - CSA - Child (children, childhood) Sexual Assault or Abuse

&gt; - SA - Sexual Assault or Abuse which includes, but is not limited to, rape

&gt; - SU - Suicide

&gt; - SUI - Suicidal Ideation (that ""I want to die!"" stage before being actively suicidal. This is when people start making their plans, writing things down, and gathering materials)

&gt; - SI - Self Injury

These abbreviations are, of course, imperfect and not utilized by everyone, but they are in use on SRS. Should we all be using these abbreviations, as a way to streamline trigger warnings?

This movement was birth as an American manifestation of the spirit that gave rise to the Arab Spring that overthrew the Egyptian and Tunisian dictatorships that sought to bring the pro-democracy spirit to America in its own way. The main slogans of the Occupy Movement are things like “Occupy Everything” and “We are the 99%”. These slogans manifested themselves quite literally in the hundreds of occupations of public parks, buildings, and central spaces across America, the rest of the western hemisphere, and even in parts of Europe and Asia that are going on as we speak.  They organize without leaders, using consensus democratic processes in most places, and seek to create the basis for equalizing the wealth of this nation between ALL its citizens.

Now the obvious question that’s probably being levied at me right now in your head is “why would you be against this?” I will say this: I support the goals and ideas of the Occupy movement but I think the movement is on weak foundation and further I believe as an African I have little in common with the occupiers and their movement in terms of tactics, goals, and organizational methods.  I’m splitting my criticisms into 3 sections: issues with the message of the “99%”, issues with the idea of occupying stuff, and issues with having our voices heard. I’m going to try to be specific to my criticisms from an African perspective and while I do have more generalized criticisms of the movement I will try and leave them other to expand upon or I may do it myself in another article.

“We are the 99%!” “Who me? Nah I’m just black”

As a sociologist who specializes in social inequality and the dynamics of the movements that seek to redress said inequalities, I was extremely interested in the Occupy movement right from when my activist best friend, Clifford Cawthon first mentioned it over this past summer. I became much less interested when I heard the 99% slogan and the idea that “we are all part of the 99%”. First off, studying inequality it’s not the 1% vs the 99% it’s really the top 10-20% vs everyone else. Including that top 10% in with the movement lacks accuracy of description (which one can say isn’t the most important thing in the world) and of whom the enemy is. That top 10% that largely manages the system for the superrich aka the 1% are almost more responsible for the current situation than they are. These are the stock brokers, banker assistants, and politicians / lobbyists, who chose, in full knowledge of what damage they were doing cooked books, cheated homeowners, and chose to keep their jobs doing dirt rather than give it up to do the right thing. The same goes for the cops, until you take off that uniform you are just as responsible for clubbing a student with the stick as the mayor who ordered you to do it.

Another issue I have with the 99% concept is that it smacks of the rhetoric we black and brown people heard from the Left back in the 70’s, that we’re all just people and we need to be colorblind, and that we are all being oppressed by the same people and on and on… Those thoughts are valid, kind of if you ignore much of American history. My oppression as a black man in America is very, very different from that of a poor white person. Yes we both ended up poor and without food or a job but he doesn’t get called a nigger or have to deal with the very real reality of racism. Although the white middle class who’s central to the Occupy movement are right about Wall Street and politicians they fail to see that the struggle is different if you’re a woman, gay, Black, Latino, Native American, etc. Many of the aforementioned groups have been in the gutter for…. Um… ever. Actually yea really forever since this nation was created many of us have been at the bottom of the pile. With that said I think it’s a serious problem when someone tells me that my struggles are the same as theirs and I should get behind a movement that I had little part in creating. This is what the relationship (especially in places like my hometown of Buffalo) between the occupation and oppressed minorities has been since the beginning.  It smacks of the reductionism that we have seen from the likes of the 10’s-40’s communist / socialist movement and its dealings with black people and how the movement has almost always dealt with women (aka sexism as a secondary issue).

Related to this idea we have to question the veracity of the 99% when many in the 99% are oppressors themselves. The kindly white people from the suburbs of Buffalo that has joined our occupation don’t realize that they had a lot to do with (due to apathy and ignorance) why black and latino people in Buffalo are so bad off today. Men don’t realize we oppress women and promote rape culture every day, often without even realizing it. The list goes on, but the point is that from our perspectives as oppressed people for those who otherwise wouldn’t give a crap about our issues or persons asking us to join their movement only after they start feeling what we have dealt with for years seem really disingenuous. The idea of the 99% is nice and catchy but it doesn’t exist. I have an independent identity as an African man who grew up in America which warrants a different approach and appreciation for me and my people’s circumstances. Same goes for women and especially Native Americans who have barely been even included in the Occupy movement as spectators. If I can speak for others, the moral of the story is that everyone is not in the same boat and by virtue of that uniqueness we wish the dominant classes of society would begin to deal with us on our own terms not theirs.

“Go Occupy Your Own %$#@”

This issue stems very much from the last paragraph and that has to do with message and who it caters to. The occupy movement was started by the professional left and the white middle class (men in particular). That is a fact (which people are very uncomfortable with) that has shaped the rest of the events that have transpired in the movement. One of the consequences of having the middle class at the front aside from the 99% slogan is the idea of occupying stuff. The thesis behind it is that we as the 99% built this nation and do most of the work yet the 1% hordes the wealth and power for themselves. Therefore what we should do is occupy real and political space and take back what rightfully belongs to us.

The problem is that none of this stuff is ours. And by none of it I mean NONE of it. This nation is an example of what some call settler colonialism. Basically it’s: See nice land with people—kill all the people/ enslave them—move in on land—claim that this is now your homeland. That’s America’s history in a line a nation of genociders, poor people who were exploited, ex slaves, and the survivors of the slaughter. If the movement really wants to be inclusive they need to acknowledge this history. The slogan “Decolonize the Occupation” has been going around for a while among the native community in response to the occupation and basically the message is that yes we understand your goals and stand behind them but this is our land, stolen from us, just for you ought to be dependent on justice for our people too. How can you occupy something that is stolen?

The other major issue that comes up here is that the middle class (and Americans in general) is lamenting the loss of their livelihoods and lifestyles but they fail to remember that all they got is stolen from other people. There is no taking back blood money or recouping losses due to illegal activity. For black people many of us ask why you would even want this back. From the land, to the “government” to the wealth I want none of it aside from the labor of our ancestors. This nation has always been morally and politically bankrupt from the perspective of the oppressed and to want to actually own any of the spoils of imperialism would be tantamount to the Jews wanting to take over the institutions of the Nazi state. Added to that, most of the oppressed want to see this joint burn. American capitalism is clear on what it want to do and only by flipping the script will we have some hope for change so for me and people who think like me occupying anything as principle has a bad rhetorical and material basis for legitimacy.

“Stop It! That’s Divisive!”

The above line is the almost automatic response to almost anyone who has brought up race or gender or class (between middle and working class people) issues in the occupation. To many people the Occupy movement is strictly about economic inequalities and Wall Street not about race, gender, or class although they have no problem welcoming black people, women, or the unemployed as supporters.  It’s indicative of a lack of recognition of race, gender, or class (and other issues) in the occupation (and its connection to capitalism and economics) and any felt need for the creation of spaces to deal with these issues in any real way.

A very good instance of this was when an older black woman at Occupy Buffalo during one of the first GA’s brought up a proposal to boycott the Buffalo news establishment (the Buffalo News, Channel 2, 4, and 7 and other outlets) because of the years of racism, classism, and suburban bias that all these institutions have exhibited. Now for anyone who’s black in Buffalo the Buffalo News is worth little to nothing because of how bad it is at reporting on issues in the city and portraying our community in particular in a very negative light while ignoring much of the corruption and nefarious activity that goes on in City Hall or in the suburbs. After making the proposal there was a few blocks that came up and when the facilitator asked one of the women why she blocked the proposal she said “I understand why this is an issue for you but since the news is reporting on the occupation nicely and not slandering us it would hurt the movement to go along with this” aka I don’t really give a hoot since the movement is more important than that issue.

Another local instance was when O Buffalo hosted a Police Appreciation Day to celebrate peaceful police and give the BPD a pat on the back for not arresting them or harassing the occupation.  Problem: why they were patting them on the back the BPD was elsewhere in the city like they have always been doing harassing black and brown and poor people. Then when I and others brought up the issue we were derided as bring divisive and too radical.

The point of telling these two stories is to say that the occupation is unfriendly to those who don’t wholly invest in the ideas of the 99% and all that comes with it. Consensus democracy makes sure that the minority, whether it is black people, women or other’s voices and goals stay in the background and like mentioned above the goals of movement falls outside the point of view of many of the people who the movement seeks to recruit. The problem is that these are institutional problems that have yet to be solved on a large-scale aside from resolutions that say minorities need to be included and POC and Women working groups sprouting up in some occupations. If we don’t feel welcomed to make our issues, which are unique to us, known without being called whatever why would we want to come down to the occupations? Many locals wonder why they are so white, or male, or whatever much of the problem is that your movement is organized to cater to white middle class men who can afford to camp outside 24/7 and have the political and material resources to stay there. It’s not catered in any way to say a single Latina women with children and it’s unlikely that she would ever show up to a general assembly because of that.

Conclusion: “Let’s Do Our Own Thing”

When I started following the occupation I was amazed at the organization, goals, and spirit of those involved until I began to talk to people and get involved myself. When I began to do that I realized that much like how the 99% slogan seeks to meld everyone into a united, American people’s front the occupation is a reflection of all that is good and bad about American society. That includes racism, sexism, homophobia, aversion to radical politics and the like. Because of the presence of these elements at large and the lack of organized redress of these issues many have decided to abandon the occupations and strike out on their own. I have decided to do the same and call on other people of African descent to do the same. I say this not out of bitterness but out of recognition of the history of black people and other minorities in movements and institutions dominated by middle class whites. They support freedom and change as long as they lose nothing and we don’t force them to question their own morality or privilege. This has been an endemic issue on the Left that needs to be addressed if there is ever going to be a truly united revolutionary movement in America.

Looking at how Africans in the past dealt with white Leftists and revolutionaries they always took the stance that we as oppressed people need our own space to articulate our struggle and push our struggle forward. The place of whites in that case is to make change within their communities and make sure we don’t get slaughtered fighting for our freedom.  The first and most important problem with the occupy movement that leads to all that I have written about is that they sought to speak for everyone in America without really knowing what we want and how we want to go about getting what we want. Until white/ male liberals and leftists take the time to understand the oppressed on their own terms vs. always trying to bring them behind their movements or ideas the Left will never be able to mount any real offensive against capital that won’t collapse under its own contradictions.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_o5ptn,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/o5ptn/the_99_isnt_me_being_the_minority_in_the_99/,

The prof said something that, at the time, I scoffed at but am now a bit more curious about.

She offhandedly mentioned that science is a privileged epistemology in most Western nations.  She said that it is taken for granted that science is the best way to know something.

In my reactionary early youth, I laughed and thought to myself ""Yeah, well let's see faith come up with a polio vaccine.""  But it's occurred to me lately that this singular obsession with science as the king of all epistemologies is one of the things that annoys me about New Atheism.  To put it in context, cold rationality/faux objectiveness are some of the hallmarks of the redditry highlighted on /r/SRS.  Perhaps the privileging of a scientific epistemology plays into this?

If somebody smarter than I could help me with some of these questions, I would be rather grateful.

* If science is a privileged epistemology, what are some of the other (less privileged) epistemologies?

* Reactionary Youth Self was right on the one hand: a scientific epistemological approach brought us the polio vaccine.  So what value could other epistemological approaches bring us?

The Coles Notes version would be great, but I'm also interested in articles on the subject, or even a good book if someone has recommendations.

Okay, so I've been having some issues lately with my boyfriend- very quick background: we've been together over a year, live together, have a dog together.  He is Super Awesome overall, but there are some things about him that really bug me.  ""Really bug me"" is understatement of the year.  


We have discussed feminism earlier on in the relationship- he actually mentioned on our first date that he was a feminist, having been raised by a very feminist mother, and I thought that was awesome- but the deeper I go into this relationship the more it seems like his childhood made him resentful of feminism.  He often states how white men are the most hated group on earth whenever people bring up the idea of privilege or prejudice- whether it be sexism, racism or etc... I mean, getting into MRA territory no?  He doesn't see the advantage he has-- he is a white male who is also very intelligent, he makes a 6-figure salary...I mean, c'mon.  I know he wasn't raised into the upper class, but he thinks that any acknowledgment of privilege is the same as saying he hasn't worked hard his entire life.  


He also states he has overcome being bullied as a child and was seen as stupid growing up, he had a speech impediment and was a large child so I can see how he'd be a target, oh and he has anxiety issues, and I completely get that he Has had to overcome adversity- something he often brings up automatically should I bring up something regarding prejudice, however that does not take away from the adversity from minority groups-.  Being a woman is often like having a speech impediment your entire life, but without having to say anything in order to be judged and evaluated.  People just look at women and think of them as ""other"" or somehow less important--I know things are getting better and this is not the case for everyone, but ""Society"" does this all the time.  


Okay, so he has different view points as me, I could deal with that- but sometimes he says things that are at least borderline sexist- and then when I bring it up, instead of apologizing should I find it offensive, he basically will justify what he says by telling me it's not offensive.  He is telling Me what is not offensive...wha?  Yesterday specifically- we were watching Mythbusters and there were a male and female professional baseball/softball players- and on the show they referred to the male by his name or his profession or by the fact that he was a man, and they referred to the female as a ""girl.""  I said ""I dunno, she looks like a woman to me.  My boyfriend then proceeds to tell me that most women don't mind being referred to as ""girl,"" and that some even prefer it because it makes them seem young and pretty.  I didn't even recognize my boyfriend at this point, and I stood my ground I asked him how he could even know that.  He always dismisses studies due to bias, but there he is completely unable to see his own bias on this matter- I know he is intelligent and he thinks himself to be objective-- but there he was telling me that most women liked to be called ""girls."" I tried to explain that it was condescending and just because society does it often does not make it any less so- and then I said at the very least, it offends me.  He says okay, and we drop the subject.  


Several weeks ago, he said something offensive that had to do with boyfriends training ""girls"" to like computers...and that time I said yet again, that's offensive (for a few reasons) for his use of ""girls"" as he was not referring to actual girls, but partners/girlfriends- who would be women.  Anytime he says anything offensive and I call him out on it (as politely as I can) and he doesn't find it offensive, he does not apologize but instead goes on about how it's not offensive because he didn't mean it offensively.  I have tried to explain that because he does not Know he is being offensive does not mean he is not being offensive.  


Once I brought up how awesome Anne Hathaway was when she responded to the news correspondent regarding her up-dress photos- I said what happened and her response and how I thought it was awesome, his immediate response was ""I like it when celebrities don't take themselves too seriously.""  I mean.. she was talking about the sexualization of unwilling women...it's an issue that is rampant in society...Bahh


I feel very strongly about the subject, and so when having conversations about it with him I am unable to really form complete sentences because I just get so angry I can't think or really say anything.  It really just blows my mind- he will literally talk about being a white male as though it is the worst thing in the world and he has it so bad because everyone has so many assumptions about him and will make him feel bad about what he has accomplished-- but isn't the point that the assumptions made about him are not really keeping him from his potential from the get-go, society doesn't tell him he's worthless... bah I am just rambling now I can't even put together a complete thought from beginning to end.


Anyways, I want to be able to talk about this, but like I said, he gets defensive and denies a lot- even when I bring it up as sensitively as I can ""i know you didn't mean to sound this way, but when you said *this* it made me feel like *that*"" I just don't know...

I also get that there may be cases where they are not the right solution to a person's problem, or where they are overprescribed.

However, I still believe that ADHD is overdiagnosed, and that stimulant drugs shouldn't be used on young children, except under exceptional circumstances. I believe that there are a lot of problems with the way psychiatric drugs are marketed and sold, and the way mental health professionals tend to treat their patients in the U.S. (where I live). But I REALLY want to avoid the kind of invalidating language used by people who just flat out deny that such mental health issues exist, or who insist that they're minor problems and can be solved with minor lifestyle changes.

This is pretty specific to Hawaii, but I think (hope) some of the concepts can be applied in a larger context, and that I accurately described some of the terms and ideas I used. Please let me know if I said something really objectionable.

**[Here's the post](http://keakealani.tumblr.com/post/43414165241/racism-in-hawaii-it-needs-to-be-discussed)**

Otherwise, although I've posted about other similar topics in the past, I would be interested in anyone who has thoughts or discussion about this kind of topic. I feel as if it is an interesting place to talk about the place of racism and overlapping layers of privilege and oppression. It is not as clear cut as in other parts of the country, but I feel as if it is possible that an axis of race privilege can coexist simultaneously with an axis of residency length privilege (for lack of a better way to put that), even though the residency length tends to be defined along racial lines (but not always).

I suspect, although I don't have first-hand experience, that other cultures experience this to varying degrees. I think it is a similar principal to the issue of ""gaijin"" in Japan, wherein resentment about Western colonialization and supplantation of ideas leads to frustration with white people in general, or similar to ""small town mentality"" in rural areas or even tribal-like social systems in urban regions that prioritize people of a certain social status even within the context of racial oppression.

We talk about it as the introduction of Western exploitation of third world countries poverty, but in the past when I've studied this I've found it to be more complicated than that. Why? The exploitation was already there.

Children were already working, and doing so in ways that served an export economy to more affluent nations, but prior to industrialization they worked in fields, mines, quarries, and other jobs which are objectively more dangerous and lower paying. In some places that's still the norm, and it's why I recommend anyone interested in getting chocolates this Christmas be careful about which ones you buy, because most of the affordable stuff is made using child slaves.

When a third world nation uses cheap child labor in industrialization, several things happen. It draws in business and also centralization, as well as increased infrastructure including clean water and roadways. The average wealth of those working these jobs is still despicably low, but even there it is *better* than what it was. And from here you see increased rates of education, literacy, and eventually things like unionization.

Perhaps even more significant, this is a third world nation using its access to cheap labor to compete with the Western countries that have *already* placed an economic stranglehold on them. In recognition of this fact, and the potential for these admittedly cold and unpleasant practices to fuel growth of economies which are considered to be ""behind the curve,"" the United Nations specifically excludes developing and severely impoverished nations from many of its regulations concerning child labor.

This is not a call to say the way it is is good, or that it doesn't often come with a problematic Westernization, and anti-union violence in places like South America demonstrate that the process forward from here isn't a clean or easy one, but rather I find that the issue is complex enough that no, we as citizens living in a First World society do not have a right to shame Third World nations for what practices they take up in order to compete with us in this case. 

Of course, it's been years since I looked in depth at any of this, so I'm open to being told that I'm wrong. I'm even more open to alternatives that don't bite quite so hard as the cold and exploitative process of industrialization.

Individuals are assessed for their ability to consent to sexual situations, and if they fail the test, they are not allowed any sort of sexual activity with other people. A significant portion of the test deals with the ideas of pregnancy and reproduction in general.  In many cases, individuals are denied the right to consent because of their lack of understanding the risks of getting someone pregnant.  What I was wondering was if it would be considered more ethical to perform a sterilization procedure (vasectomy, tubal ligation) and allow them to have sexual activity in their lives? Many of the individuals I have worked with want the right to sexual activity very badly, but will never be allowed to have sex at any time in their lives. In some cases, when new agencies were involved in the individuals care or new standards were proposed, people who were allowed to consent previously, in some cases for as long as 20 years have lost that right. In addition, these restrictions tend to lead to levels of sexual harassment of staff (by clients) that would get any other people arrested, which is also problematic.

One response to the question of why the individuals could not have a vasectomy or tubal ligation is that they are not able to consent to the surgery either.

DOUBLE THE KARMA MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA .... oh wait.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a truth universally *un*acknowledged that we are living in the midst of a stalled gender revolution. The women's movement has been very successful in helping women break into the formerly male-dominated market of paid labor. But there has been no corresponding movement of men into the female-dominated non-market of unpaid labor mostly performed within the home. Like a rubber-band stretched to its limit, women's ""liberation"" seems to be moving backwards now, with more and more women succumbing to pressures at home to cut down on their participation in paid work or else succumbing to pressures at work to the detriment of their personal health/lives and  that  of their marriages. 

""The Second Shift"" recounts Arlie Hochschild's studies on how housework and childcare is shared by couples all across America, details in-depth interviews of 11 dual-earner couples with children, and presents the author's own theories and conclusions based on her observations. 

According to her, 

**The Problem Is...**

...that for a variety of reasons, men do not perform nearly enough of necessary domestic labor and routine childcare within households. This leads to women who work outside the home to take on a whole second shift of domestic labor all by themselves, which causes unbearable stresses between the domains of home, family, marriage, and work. There are literally not enough hours in the day to do everything, even though many women sure do try. Hochschild's research found that women work a full extra month compared to men every year, on average, in such homes. Equally important is the leisure gap between men and women: in the hundreds of couples she interviewed she found that most men take time for themselves and their hobbies, but NONE of the women she interviewed - NONE - had any hobbies at all. The women, as a result, suffered from a decreased ability to participate in paid work (and paid the price for that loss of power within the home, and their identities as independent women), or else they made up for the time they spent on their work by cutting back on their commitmemnt to their marriage or kids (and paid the price for THAT in guilt, stress, loss of emotional support when they needed it most, loss of identity as mothers or women, etc). The men faced no such impossible choices, since the entire weight of traditional gender roles allows them to balance work, kids, home, and family without conflict. However, men still paid an unacknowledged but huge price in how bad their marriages were, how much resentment they faced from their wives, and how little they connected with their children. 

WHY and HOW this happens within the microcosm of the home is what the book is about. Hochschild analyzes this under the lens of four core concepts - 

**1. Gender Ideology**

Gender ideology is what a person believes about what is ""proper"" for a given gender to do, say, or act like. Hochschild classifies ideologies into three types: ""traditional"" (belief in traditional gender-roles, that women belong at home and with kids, that men are providers);""egalitarian"" (the belief that both men's and women's career ambitions are equally important, and deserve equal support by men sharing in unpaid domestic and childcare work equally); and ""transitional"" (a blend of the above two, typically manifested in women as the desire to have a great career while also being responsible for home and family, and in men as being ""all for"" their wives working, and willing to ""help out"" a little but she remains in charge of home and family).  

Take the example of Nancy and Evan Holt, one of the couples interviewed in-depth.  Nancy has a deep need to be a ""career woman"", and desperately wants a marriage in which her husband is a ""New Age Man"", a man who shares in domestic work and supports her career as a social worker equally to his. Nancy is egalitarian. Evan on the other hand ""thinks it's *fine* for Nancy to have a career, and he can see it's very important to her, but can't understand why *her* choice should change or affect *his* life."" His gender ideology is classic transitional. 

Another example: Frank and Carmen Delacorte, who both agree that a woman's place is in the home and a man's function is to provide. But Carmen still works - runs a thriving daycare center out of her home - due to economic necessity. Carmen enjoys her job but feels very strongly that if she didn't need the paycheck she would give it up in a heartbeat to become a ""milk and cookies"" mom like she has always wanted. Where Nancy Holt feels like she *must* work and *must* find her work important, Carmen Delacorte feels her ""real work"" is her home and children. What's surprising about the Delacortes, though, is that when it comes to household chores (though not childcare) they are almost egalitarian. Frank, even while maintaining that Carmen does everything, actually pitches in and does *way* more domestic work than Evan Holt. Frank and Carmen are traditional ""on top"" but nearly egalitarian ""on the bottom"". 

It's not at all uncommon for 'top' and 'bottom' gender ideologies of a person to be in direct conflict. For example, most of the men claimed to have a transitional gender ideology on 'top', but either through their actions or  during in-depth interviews or both, revealed that they were in fact traditional when it came right down to it. Many women who *claimed* to be egalitarian often suffered from guilt when they confronted their husbands about not doing enough around the house, and did a lot more around the house just as a gift to their husbands because they somehow didn't feel good about ""making"" him cook and clean, revealing that they were 'transitional' underneath.

What is your gender ideology? What is your partner's?

One surefire way of seeing what the ""bottom"" gender ideology of a person really is, is to examine their [**Gender Strategy**](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/zeggj/a_summary_of_arlie_hochschilds_the_second_shift/c63uqns).",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_zeggj,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/zeggj/a_summary_of_arlie_hochschilds_the_second_shift/,

I have never known anyone who needed to get an abortion or who was going through an unwanted pregnancy. I'm making this post to try to understand the SRS standpoint on abortion (which I think is that having an abortion is always ok, being the woman's choice). I am only considering the case where pregnancy occurred as a result of consensual sex between adults, and only considering abortion from a moral standpoint (not legal). 

It seems like there are two arguments that pro-choicers use against the pro-life ""abortion is killing a baby"": (i) no, the fetus is not alive and (ii) that's irrelevant, it's my body and i have the right to choose if i need an abortion or not. 

I agree with argument (i) most of the time, but I think it breaks down as the pregnancy moves forward. For example, at 6 months in the womb, a baby can practice walking, has fully developed vocal chords, can open/close eyes in reaction to light, and is undergoing rapid brain development. I think a pretty good argument can be made that around this time the baby is alive by our ""human"" standards. 

As for (ii), which seems to be brought up more often here, I'm not convinced by. If you accept that the baby can be a live human in the womb at a certain point during pregnancy, then it seems to be implying that having the bodily freedom to stop a difficult pregnancy is more important than not killing a baby. I can understand that some people may think that, but I can also understand why pro-lifers don't.

The CFCV (Collectif Féministe Contre le Viol = Feminist Collective Against Rape) made itself know last year with a shock campaign ""[the shame should switch side](http://osocio.org/message/rape_the_shame_should_switch_sides/)"", and is back this year with a message about the clichés ""defending"" rapists. The three posters show rapists and their victim, and the ""moral justification"" over the rapists heads, hovering like an aureola  «A woman doesn't dress sexy for nothing», «A woman who doesn't want should refuse clearly», «A woman should always satisfy her husband». The tagline is «Nothing should exonerate a rapist.»

1. It's never been applied to a specific group of people the way other slurs have. The R word is a slur against mentally challenged people. Dumb is offensive to deaf people, and lame to physically disabled people. 

2. Tying to the previous, this word isn't related to any institutionalized or systemic practice. There can't ne discrimination without a group to practice it on.

The only argument I heard, reading some material posted around the internet, is that stupid is a slur because it implicitly claims intelligence is innate.

I've been super ultra busy IRL and had to postpone it from last week. Unfortunately... I have to postpone it from this week too. It was supposed to be tonight but I've just been up for 30 hrs at work and have to get some sleep. So the plan is:

#SRSEducation night is a go for Friday June 29th for a 5:30 PM EST start time!! We hope all of you can make it.

*The Topic:*

**Gender: Dispelling the Myths**

This evening will discuss some myths about gender that people experience in their daily lives. It will go over many of the misconceptions that people have about gender binary, trans* individuals and identity. Guest speakers will be from varying backgrounds and should help to give a unique perspective on the gender challenges they face.

*How to join:*

Join room #SRSEducation on synirc. The room is currently on, but mute, so there isn't much discussion going on there (so there's no point in joining early).

**Do not join** if you cannot answer yes to this question: Do you think your opinion could be changed if you were presented with reasonable arguments?

*Rules:*

* Do not argue over dictionary definitions. We may briefly go over privilege and language use, but we are using the standard sociology definition that *-ism(s) requires both individual advantages and institutional power. Reverse racism don't real. We are also aware that intersectionality exists and can change your ability to experience your privilege or minority status.

* Do not use ALL CAPS. You will be kicked.

* Do not use colours. You will be kicked.

* Do not flood chat with many lines of text. I think the current standard is 10 post in 6 seconds will warrant a kick.

* Be polite and respectful, even to those you disagree with. OPs can and will kick based upon their interpretation and reading of content, not on any supposed intent. Intention means nothing, it's up to you to ensure that your text doesn't come across in a mean-spirited or disrespectful way.

* This is a place for education. Please come in good faith. If OPs feel that you are trolling, they will kick and/or ban you. We will try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but we want to keep the discussion flowing and as informative as possible.

* Do not use slurs. Slurs will get you kicked and/or banned. This includes some of the more common but relatively still accepted terms, so you might want to brush up on what's race/sex/cissex/able/heterosex/ect-ist.

* If you have been kicked three times in a session you will get banned. Depending upon the severity of the offence, you may have to message one of the OPs in order to have that ban removed. Generally, we will try to remove bans for the next topic.

It seems like Dan advised a couple where one was a ""somnophiliac"", or someone who liked to have sex with asleep women, to have the girl take Ambien or a sleep drug so they can have sex without her waking up. Dan dismisses someone who writes in and calls the somnophiliac a rapist (and not very nicely).

But Dan's dismissal aside, I have to agree with one point Dan made: taking Ambien for your lover/getting unconscious SAFELY for them/ engaging in your fetish in creative ways does not make either party a rapist. The question of consent kind of falls by the wayside in extreme cases like these: the case by it's very nature is meant to be morally ambiguous. There is a term for this fetish, by the way, in the alt community, and it's called ""non-con,"" or ""non-consent."" And as personally offensive this fetish may be, and whatever emotions it might bring up, it seems like non-con fits what this situation is. Not rape.

But, then again, I think it is very freaking dangerous to give that situation permission to exist in the first place. Too much can go wrong. Consent is important. It seems like there is a simple way around it, though: I propose a scenario where the sleeping beauty party tells a little lie about taking the Ambien, makes a show of it for the guy with the fetish, only* pretends* to sleep, and stays conscious for the whole thing with him being none the wiser. It seems like a very simple solution with no moral or legal snafus.

What does SRS think about this?http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSBooks

EDIT: I think, after the responses, I more angry about Dan Savage being all "" LOL, AMBIEN"" than anything else. It seemss Ambien is not a fuck to be given freely. It is downright dangerous.

The simplest definition I can think of is disregarding privacy and ignoring someone's discomfort. It involves moral choices. If you act entitled to someone's affection, don't take no for an answer, or keep contacting someone despite getting no response. Breaking into someone's apartment or other privacy violations are creepy, as well. Actions like this are fine to criticize.

But when someone talks about creepiness, there's a often a heavy dose of virgin shaming in there, too. You know, the ""Haha, you're not successful with in the area of sex and dating and I'm going to laugh about it!"" Someone can be creepy and have a lot of sex, and someone can be celibate not by choice and not be creepy at all. Silvio Berlusconi may be the creepiest motherfucker out there, and who knows who's had more sex than him. 

Whatever happened to that Berlusconi face in the comments, by the way? Was it taken out?

The smiley seen most is the Lonely Island song one, The Creep. The directions for being creepy in that song are 

&gt;Now pull your waistband up like you expectin' a flood  
&gt;And slick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
&gt;Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
&gt;Put this in your speakers; you a certified creeper.

Mostly about being unattractive. Nicki Minaj, on the other hand, earns the the title by hiding in a locker and spying on men in the changing room. 

It feels like that's a very common idea, the idea that 
creepiness is tied to attractiveness, and that's an attitude present even in SRSprime. 

The blurring of the line between creep shaming and virgin shaming makes it more difficult to address actually creepy behavior, and allows for responses like ""1. Be attractive. 2. Don't be unattractive""

It was the last picture of someone's Great Grandfather in a German uniform. The comments are overall fairly decent. Many people point out that very many German soldiers were not ideological Nazis, just normal people sent off to die for a bad cause. In other words, people are empathizing with the subject of the photo. 

Later on this evening someone posted [this picture of Ground Zero, Nagasaki.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/tb8ny/ground_zero_nagasaki/) The thread here is rather different from the earlier thread regarding the German soldier. Some people are pointing out the horror of the tens of thousands of civilians who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The common response seems to be ""they deserved it."" The arguments are that it's total war and so civilians don't really matter. In other words, when the subject is *Japanese* rather than German, redditors are less inclined to empathize. 

Now perhaps this is just the fact that a photo of an individual who died is inherently more empathy-friendly than a monument and a description of faceless numbers of people. *Perhaps.* But I wrote a fairly in-depth paper on the naval war in the Pacific and the sheer amount of racism coming from American sources was staggering. Obviously the Germans were referred to very negatively, even in racist terms, but there seems to be a qualitative difference. 

For example, American Naval doctrine actually suggested that the Japanese be attacked at night because ""their eyes are smaller and make it harder for them to see in the dark"" (a paraphrase). Language referring to Germans was hateful, yes. But there doesn't seem to have been as much of an idea of the Germans being *physically* inferior. 

So all that is to say, are these two different reactions to two former enemies of America portraying a still inherent racist reaction toward the Japanese? Are Germans easier for Americans to sympathize with? Do you see racism at play here, or is it simply that a face in one photo is easier to empathize with? I'm really very curious about this mixed reaction to two former Axis powers, especially when both have been so completely reconciled to the Allied powers.

It’s a bit long, so please bear with me.

Some of you may remember this comment that was linked to in SRS the other day: 

&gt;I honestly can't count the number of times I'll be walking down the street before some self-centered asshole woman walking alone in front of me will turn her head back and give the ""oh god please don't rape me"" glance.

&gt;Bitch, I'm just trying to get to where I'm going! How dare you assume that 1) I care about you at all and 2) that I actually want to hurt you. It's sexist bullshit.

I was reading through the thread and came across someone who pointed out that women are often nervous around strange men because of most of us are accosted/harassed on a weekly basis. A poster arguing in defense of the OP claimed that men are robbed/attacked every day, which is obviously not “every day” in the same sense that women are accosted “every week”. I interjected in some kind of vain hope that the poster simply hadn’t considered things from a woman’s perspective and that shedding light on my own experiences and why I, personally, feel nervous in certain situations with strange men might help him see that it isn’t just blind sexism.

[This is the thread that resulted](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/s1hht/man_on_subway_breaks_up_a_fight_while_having_a/c4akz2z) (“rudeandginger” is my other account).

I became increasingly upset with each response so I’m not sure if I was entirely clear in my explanations. I don’t mean to say that I automatically assume that every unfamiliar man I run into is dangerous or a rapist or violent or whatever. But I’ve learned to be alert and at least a little on guard, initially, until I can determine if the person is threatening or not. I don’t have the same reactions around strange women unless they act in a threatening or aggressive manner, but that’s quite rare in my personal experience.

I understand that it must be uncomfortable and possibly hurtful for men to realize that their gender makes them at least slightly suspicious in the eyes of many women. I also think that there are a lot of situations in which this suspicion is taken too far, but I’ve never felt that my caution and uncertainty was uncalled for.

This really shook me. It’s really important to me to treat people equally, to understand others, and to not discriminate, cause harm, or perpetuate harmful ideas. The idea that I might be a bigot in any way drives me to tears, but even my grandmother seems to think that my argument is sexist (which she demonstrated by saying “What if you replaced the word ‘man’ with ‘black person’?”).

So, am I in the wrong? Have I taken caution too far? And if I have, if there’s anything I’ve said that sounds bigoted or otherwise problematic, what can I do to fix it?

I only discovered it about a month ago, but you guys have really been an awesome force to behold. Up until recently I went by the handle cuntofdoom. At the request of ArchangelleDworkin, I changed it. [Here's a pretty straight forward blog post about it from my perspective](/http://cuntofdoom.tumblr.com/post/18571067852/i-like-my-cunt). I complied because I respect the mods and I think what this community is doing is extremely important and something that I very much want to be a part of. But it really pains me to see SRSters policing the ways in which we can reclaim oppressive language. The word ""cunt"" has been thoroughly reclaimed in many feminist and queer circles. Yet it would seem that this is not enough. ArchangelleDworkin seems worried that my use of the word ""cunt"" would be misinterpreted and that she thought, from just looking at my screenname, that I was a troll. Well, if you have read this far you may have already come to the conclusion that I'm not, but if you are still dissatisfied, I encourage you to google the phrase cuntofdoom. My blog (the one I just linked to) will be the first result. I have been blogging for social justice issues for three years under this handle. Aside from it being very painful to part with a name that has become a part of who I am, I personally feel very much entitled to reclaim a word that was used to harm me and turn it into something I find empowering. The mods are worried about misinterpretation (especially outside of this subreddit, which honestly ISN'T UNDER THEIR PERVUE), but misinterpretation is EXACTLY what one plays with when they work to reclaim a term that was once abusive. It's taking a word that is hurled at you and turning around and saying ""yes, I am, and that's **Mr/Ms** (abusive term) to you!"" 

I feel too that a lot of this is built on a (perhaps justified) overactive fear of trolls. I can understand that. The mods get harassed day in and day out by these shit gobblers, and mods want to protect themselves and their fellow SRSters from this shitstorm, I get that. But if we let ourselves be ruled/terrorized by these people to the point where we deny our own the right to self-identify, something has gone wrong.

So I'd really appreciate people's thoughts on this, as a community. Is ""cunt"" a word that should be censored, even for reclamation purposes, and if so, why? I'd also specifically like to hear from ArchangelleDworkin. If she could more thoroughly explain her decision (she did briefly, but I am left feeling dissatisfied) that would be awesome.

so so SO much love to this wonderful community

Basically it was about a black high school student who, in a class discussion about attractiveness in culture, was basically singled out and told that black women look like apes and are inherently unattractive, and when she brought this to the attention of her teacher, he told her to not be offended by what is ~simply~ personal preference. 

I am a black cis female, one who has felt unattractive for most of her life. I've heard from many people, people who I've even considered friends, who would say that they are not attracted to black women for whatever reason: Too fat, unkempt/nappy hair, big noses, skin is too dark, too ""ghetto"", etc. Of course after saying this, I would always get the token ""But I'm not racist or anything"" added on as if that would make me feel better about it, especially since I have/had one or more of those above characteristics. So seeing this thread today really depressed me quite a bit, even though it's all things I've heard and seen before.

There's always been a lot of discussion about this in the black community. Hair is always big topic (should we leave it natural? Straighten it?), behavior and dress as well. But I have always wondered, what is the difference between simply not being attracted to certain characteristics, and not being attracted to a race because the aforementioned characteristics are supposedly common in said race? Obviously the latter is more problematic than the first one. 

So I suppose my question to this board is, where exactly do you draw the line? Is it acceptable to say you are more attracted to one race than another? I'm also sorry if this is somewhat incoherent.

I know, how strange. Anyways, it kind of shocked me today when a friend I'd had for a really long time, whom I thought was extremely liberal, made a completely and totally Antisemitic joke to my face -- in front of a couple of other friends -- and expected me to think it was funny.

For the record, I'm a Jew.

I'm not a shy person. So I basically said, ""hey Aaron (names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent), calling it the lolocaust is really fucked up, and not at all funny. Please stop being a fucking antisemite or I'm going to have to pull over and ask you to get the fuck out of my car."" And I did actually say fuck that often.

So dead silence ensues. Aaron turns really red, mutters something under his breath, hisses out ""sorry, jeez"" and the rest of the car ride is either silent or filled with jilted conversation.

We get to where we're going. My friend Heidi walks beside me when I fall back from the group while we're walking somewhere. ""Hey,"" she says, ""don't you think you were kind of harsh on Aaron? I mean, it's not like he's you're racist grandmother."" (Explanation: at bars, I tell stories about how incredibly racist my grandmother is for the black humor of it. It's kind of a known thing in my circle of friends. Along with the time my brother shit on my floor. But back to what I was talking about).

""Fuck no."" I say. ""That shit he said was fucked up. I'm not going to fucking cry about it or anything, but it kind of pissed me off and made my mood do a nosedive.""

""Uh, okay,"" she says. Then she catches up with Dave and they exchange side glances and whispers as we approach our destination on foot, gesturing to me when they think I'm not looking.

That's just one example of what I'm talking about. Another is Reddit. It's full of atheists, censorship opponents, and people against the War on Drugs. But doesn't it feel like we're not really expecting a lot from people if that's enough to give something a pass as ""liberal,"" even though it's homophobic, sexist, racist, classist, ablist, and sizeist as hell?

Yeah, and don't even get me started on President Obama and most establishment ""liberals"".

What I'm trying to point out here is that it doesn't take me but an hour to find an example of someone (in real life or otherwise) who is both shockingly ignorant *and* who is also thought of by their peers as very left of center.

Since when can you be liberal and use fag as a pejorative? Since when can you be liberal and take the idea of reverse racism seriously? Fucking shit people! This isn't goddamned rocket science! I'm not seriously suggesting that you have to take at least 12 credit hours of sociology courses at an accredited university to be considered a bona fide liberal. Maybe, just maybe, the average person should be able to figure out -- without any serious academic study -- that calling women ""cunts"" is gross, it's not racist that black people can call each other ""niggas"" and you can't, and wanting to fuck teenagers -- or defend people who want to fuck teenagers -- is not fucking right.

Shit.

My question is this... am I moving the goal posts too much? Are human beings seriously this shitty that we can't reasonably expect people to figure out really basic things about human decency on their own? What the actual fuck does it mean to be liberal in America anymore, if you can be a racist, sexist, pedophile neckbeard shitlord and still be considered liberal -- and not just moderately liberal, *really* liberal?",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_paawo,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/paawo/do_we_have_too_low_of_expectations_of_what_it/,

(I don't think it's offensive to men or oppressive or some shit.)

A while back I attended a discussion about sexual assaults on campus.  

We got on to the subject of rape culture, and it was recommended by a person in the discussion that we abstain from using gendered slurs, because they normalize rape culture.  

Included in the list of gendered slurs was the word dick.  I was taken aback.  It seemed to me a ""whatabouttehmenz!?"" statement and it seemed out of place in a forum about sexual assaults against women.  

However, the person pointed out something that sparked something for me:  use of the ""dick"" might normalize rape culture, as does ""cunt/pussy.""

Dick, while an insult, I suppose, is something of a congratulatory term: just look at the way ""team America"" defined it--a necessary evil to keep ""pussys"" and ""assholes"" in line.  Dick carries with it the connotation of male power: when you call someone a dick you are implying something beyond their behavior--you are acknowledging that their maleness helped them get away with what they did.  

A person called a ""dick"" and a person called a ""pussy"" both might be described as in-courteous, but only one means powerful, and only one means weak.  

Is it possible that we normalize male dominance, and in a way rape culture, when we use the term ""dick"" to describe someone?

This is an idea I've been bouncing in my head, and I thought srsd might be the place to get some new perspectives.  



 Edit: there seems to be issue with my use of the term congratulatory.  I think, in retrospect, that it was the wrong word.  

What I was getting at is that, in this culture, to be a dick is more desirable than to be any female gendered word.  ",,False,,t5_2t5sa,True,,,True,t3_o63wo,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/o63wo/should_we_use_the_word_dick_a_discussion_of_the/,

Breanna Manning stands accused of being the source for Wikileaks' Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, as well as the embassy cables. She has been held in solitary confinement for over a year, sexually humiliated, and placed on 24 hour suicide watch that involves a guard waking her up every 10 minutes to make sure she hasn't harmed herself.

Breanna's hearing started this week, if convicted of the twentysomething counts she's been indicted for, she could face the death penalty, but prosecutors have indicated they're seeking life in prison. If Breanna Manning is in fact the Wikileaks source, then does she deserve this sentence? For more insight into Manning's motives and psyche, refer to this [chatlog](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/manning-lamo-logs) between Manning and a hacker named Adrian Lamo, who passed this log to the authorities and is now the key prosecution witness against Manning.

So a couple questions:

* What have the effects of the Wikileaks publications that Manning is an alleged source for been, for better or worse?
* Is Greenwald right in pointing out the disparity between the treatment of Ellsberg and Manning?
* Is Manning a hero for exposing wrongdoing, or a traitor for exposing state secrets?

*(note: most media sources misgender Breanna as ""Bradley"", but since she identifies as a [transgender woman](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/21/1047571/-Bradley-Mannings-Transgender-Defense) I think we should respect that in this discussion, as opposed to the [open transphobia](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=breanna%20manning&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2Fblogs%2Fpolitics%2F2011%2F12%2Fbradley-manning-defense-reveals-alter-ego-named-brianna-manning%2F&amp;ei=5Lb5TtaWLcre0QHbnNG_Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNH16SyXK3i5MsLKDlN19NsWNwWNHw&amp;cad=rja) that the media has engaged in, so please use female pronouns)*",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_ns85t,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/ns85t/thoughts_on_the_breanna_manning_case/,

Which is harmful of course and represents an undercurrent of normalized and institutionalized bigotry/supremacy and in applicable cases a lack of intersectionality. The troublesomely predictable outcome of people not checking whatever privilege they may have. 

As freaking horrible as that is, I can't equate it with the outright hate speech these people spew on a frequent basis.

It's borderline gaslighting to imply that the experience of being subject to concentrated, organized, and ideologically driven vehement hate speech and having that is ""just"" a lack of representation/exclusion.

This seems to be a last-resort tactic of privileged people involved in conversations about -isms. Invoking a fallacy is a very effective way to discredit your opponent and 'win' the argument.

* First example: A man and woman are discussing street harassment. The woman recounts experiences she has had. The man tells her that her perception of those experiences were mistaken. She tells him that, because he is a man, his opinion of her experiences is necessarily irrelevant. He accuses her of using an ad hominem argument

* Second example: A MRA and feminist are discussing the men's rights movement. She characterizes it as an antifeminist movement. He denies this and accuses her of using a straw man argument.

The above are situations I've actually seen occur on this site. In many cases, the person pointing out the supposed fallacy is wrong, but still gets upvoted, while the person accused of committing the fallacy is criticized and downvoted. It seems that, oftentimes, bystanders don't actually understand whether a fallacy has really been committed. Simply making the accusation is enough to bring on the downvotes and pitchforks.

Accusing someone of committing a fallacy seems like a more sophisticated version of pointing out grammatical or spelling errors in order to suggest your opponent is ignorant or st*pid. As with other derailing tactics like the tone argument, it allows the accuser to avoid discussing the content of someone's position/argument in order to attack the MANNER in which they are arguing. ""I got nothing, so I'm going to try to defeat you using arcane debating rules.""

Let me be clear: I'm not saying every instance in which someone points out a fallacy is wrong or derailing. But I've noticed that it's increasingly being used as a derailing tactic to silence minorities and their allies.

So has anyone else noticed/encountered shitty people who resort to crying, ""fallacy!"" during arguments? Is it derailing? Are there effective ways to counter this move?

&gt;This is why I hate these kinds of discussions. They all eventually devolve into a discussion of the typical Christian antisemitic dichotomy of: ""Old Testament"" = legalistic, New Testament = ethical. The God of the ""Old Testament"" is evil, while Jesus is awesome. I'm really tried of all that....

and some others like it.  I received a variety of responses and questions, so I thought I should try to follow up in some way and explain what I was talking about.

I was really unsure how to write this honestly.  What I would want to do is give a long explanation of the history of the Christianity's use and abuse of the Old Testament vis a vis the Jews, but I'm not an expert on that sort of thing, and even though I tried really hard to become one over the weekend.. I don't think that's actually gonna happen right now :P

I can try to tell you a little bit about how I feel though, and, to start by putting all my cards on the table, I should say that I am a queer religious Jew.

Living in a Christian society, with all the weight of the history of Western culture, means that it's not easy to see Judaism from a Jewish point of view.  It's not easy for Jews to see Judaism from a Jewish point of view.  It's not easy for me to see Judaism from a Jewish point of view, and I grew up in a somewhat insular religious Jewish community, went to an Orthodox synagogue every week, attended Jewish religious private school for 13 years...

I'm not saying that Judaism is never oppressive.  I'm not saying that it's less oppressive than Christianity.  I'm not saying that the Old Testament is better than the New Testament.

What I am saying is that the reason we (myself included, unless I try hard not to) think that the New Testament/Jesus is better, more ethical, less hateful, less intolerant than the Old Testament/God  is not because it's true, and not even because that's the only way Christianity makes sense, but because that's what centuries of official Christian, anti-Semitic dogma has trained us to think.

Saying the Old Testament is legalistic and intolerant while the New Testament is ethical and loving is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, one that may have originated out of anti-Jewish sentiment, and was certainly used time and again to justify the oppression of Jews.

I don't think saying that religion is evil (necessarily) carries any antisemitic overtones.  I don't think criticizing the Bible (necessarily) carries any antisemitic overtones. I do think that criticizing the Old Testament while approving of the New Testament almost always has antisemitic overtones (even though unintentional).

I have a very very different visceral reaction to this

&gt;let me say that I'm a lapsed Jew, and fuck the Tanakh: it is every bit as oppressive and horrible as they say it is. If we didn't have a crowd of rabbis ""interpreting"" all the crap out of it, it would be utterly unbearable. It's still mostly unbearable even afterwards: that's why I left.

than to this

&gt;Now if you're a red-letter Christian you get a free pass, because Jesus said a lot of things that were very nice and not a lot of things that weren't (I disagree that he was anywhere near holy, but if you want to believe that he flew up to heaven like Superman that's your prerogative). But if you're a modern ""progressive Christian"" there are a lot of unpleasant things in your holy book that you need to deal with. Elsewhere in the thread someone brought up how, in the New Testament, parts of the Old Testament like everyone's favorite piece of shitbaggery like Leviticus have been rescinded, so they don't count as part of the Bible. But, in literally every Bible used by Christians, Leviticus is still in there. You're still using the Leviticus Bible. Cut out the crap and just decry the Old Testament entirely. I doubt there's any maliciousness in still including the oppressive Old Testament, but the issue is so danced around you'd think it was a performance art piece.

(Sorry, this was just an example.  I don't mean anything by choosing this comment in particular.)

Do you want me to prove to you though that it's not just me?  And that what I'm saying about the centuries of Christian antisemitic abuse of the Old Testament is actually true?  I can try...

The Christian Churches have used the Old Testament against the Jewish people in several ways: denigrating the Old Testament, appropriating the Old Testament and claiming it was never Jewish, and doing a little of both by getting us to think that

&gt;When you sacrifice a fellowship offering to the Lord...It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it or on the next day; anything left over until the third day must be burned up...Whoever eats it will be held responsible because they have desecrated what is holy to the Lord; they must be cut off from their people (Leviticus 19:5-8)

is Jewish, while

&gt;Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. (Leviticus 19:18) 

is not.

Here are a few of the things I came across in my failed attempt to become an instant expert on this topic:

&gt;Although Christians have traditionally credited Paul with the notion that the covenant with Christ has supplanted the covenant with Moses – thus setting up the Old Testament/New Testament paradigm – a wave of scholarship has been building in Pauline studies (often referred to as the “the new perspective on Paul)” that argues that Paul never had any such supersessionist ideas.  

&gt;There is no doubt that many negative statements about the Torah can be found in Paul’s letters.  But many scholars have convincingly argued that these statements are not intended as a wholesale rejection of Jewish law.  There are far too many positive statements Paul makes about Jewish law for such a view to be tenable. The more convincing explanation of Paul’s negative statements about Jewish law is that he opposes Jews or Judaizing Christians who wish to impose Jewish law on Gentiles as a prerequisite for being in Christ; he is not rejecting the Mosaic covenant per se.

&gt;Rather, building on the vision found in the Prophets, Paul wants to include all the “nations”..in the same covenant Israel already enjoys.  In other words, gentiles  - at least gentile believers in Jesus – can now be included in the heritage of the Jews as made known in the scriptures, but they do not need to become Jews..to partake of that heritage

&gt;The unquestioning authority of Jewish scripture that prevailed in the first century began to change in the second century.  The Epistle of Barnabus..argue[s] that the scriptures of Israel have been completely misunderstood by the Jews, both because the Jews have consistently been disobedient and because they have taken the scriptures literally and thus have not been able to see how they point to Christ

&gt;Some Christians of the second century began..to question how these scriptures…bore relevance for Christians..Furthermore, as more gentiles came to dominate Christian communities, they understandably lacked the sentimental attachment to the history and tradition of Israel that Paul and many of the gospel writers had.  Thus, Christians began to see the negative statements about the Torah made by Paul as applicable to Jews and Judaism.

&gt;The first..argument for a full-scale rejection of the scriptures of Israel came from a radical Paulinist named Marcion

&gt;[Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament..held maltheistic views of the God of the Hebrew Bible..that he was inconsistent, jealous, wrathful and genocidal..  (Wikipedia: Marcionism)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism)...

&gt;Justin [Martyr] makes an argument for the validity of Israelite scripture for Christians..The law was a kind of ad hoc necessity because of the disobedience of the Jews.  “Thus, ‘circumcision, which derives from Abraham,’ was ordained simply in order, that, even in the dispersion, the Jews might remain identifiable, and not escape their merited punishments”..

&gt;Eusebius constructed the distinction between “Hebrews” and “Jews”..the Mosaic legislation and the establishment of the Jewish nation was caused by the people’s “moral weakness” at the time, making them unable to “emulate the virtue of their fathers, inasmuch as they were enslaved by passions and sick in soul”… Christians are of course descended from Hebrews.  The patriarchs, Moses, and the prophets become the ancestors of the Christians; the biblical heroes are seen as pre-Christ Christians.  The Jews, on the other hand, are seen as illegitimate offspring, a people rightfully deprived of their heritage because of their depravity..

&gt; For Christians to gain stature in the eyes of Rome they had to demonstrate they had deep roots in antiquity.  Rome’s tolerance for Judaism and peculiar Jewish practice was largely predicated on Judaism’s claims to a long-standing tradition extending far back in time.  The need to prove to Rome that Christianity represented a long tradition exacerbated the need to push Jews out of the historical picture and claim the scriptures of Israel as exclusively Christian.

&gt;”Modern” Christian biblical studies in the Western world began during the Reformation and Enlightenment periods.  Historical criticism emerged as the dominant form of Christian biblical criticism among Protestant biblical critics as a result of the emphasis Luther, Calvin, and other reformers placed on the priority of the biblical text and on interpreting the Bible in terms of other biblical texts, rather than according to Church teachings on the Bible…

&gt;To correct for the “subjectivity” of interpretations..historical criticism sought the original, historical meaning of the biblical texts…although historical criticism no longer assumed allegorical interpretation was the best means of determining the truth of the biblical text, it retained from earlier Christian exegetes the belief that Christianity had superseded Judaism, and Christian historical critics read the biblical texts accordingly…the Christian perspective from which this work was done typically produced interpretations of the Bible and of history..that demonstrated Christianity’s superiority over Judaism.  The Christian desire to reveal the truth of the Bible was ultimately the desire to demonstrate that Jesus and his message were the fulfillment of God’s plans for humanity.

&gt;The same rationalist doctrines which triumphed in 1789 provided the ideological basis for the modern secular Jew-hatred of the 19th century.. Proudhon...thought “Monotheism is so little a Jewish or Semitic idea that the race of Shem can be said to have been repudiated by it…Monotheism is a creation of the Indo-Germanic spirit and could not have arisen from any other source""…Proudhon..accuses the Jews of having placed themselves “beyond the conscience of the human race” by the stubborn rejection of Jesus – even though personally Proudhon did not believe in the Christian message – regarding the founder of Christianity in secular terms as a revolutionary populist-socialist.  In Proudhon’s account it is doubtful if Jesus even belongs to “the race of David”; and there is nothing in common between Christ’s revolt against sacerdotal tyranny, against the doctors of the law of “pharisaic hypocrisy” and the vulgar materialism of the worshippers of Jehova…Among the antisemitic socialists in France, such attacks on Biblical morality were invariably linked with a denunciation of the financial role of the Jews in contemporary society…

&gt; Modern racial antisemitism in Germany…its roots may be found in the radial critique of Judaism that originated with the Young Hegelians..They provided a systematic, critical and “scientific” rationale for the negation of Jewry as an anti-social element and of Judaism as a religion, tradition and way of life…Like their French socialist contemporaries they absorbed the rationalist critique of Judaism as a fossilised religion whose deity was characterized as cruel, vengeful, stubborn, egotistical, imperious and absolutist.

&gt;As scholars in the nineteenth century came to identify religions that they designated as ‘Buddhism” and “Hinduism,” they claimed to find affinities in those religions with the teachings of Jesus. In the 1880s, the historian of religion Rudolf Seydel...argued that the gospels were loosely based on collections of Buddha legends, evidenced by the numerous parallels in the myths of Jesus’s and Buddha's childhoods. His work was frequently cited in efforts to “prove” the Indo-Germanic nature of Jesus. 

&gt;Connections between Jesus and Indian Buddhism were promoted by Germ man and French romantics, whose fascination with “mother India” led them to see Christianity as derived from lndia's Aryan mythology. Arthur Schopenhauer, for example, suggested parallels between Jesus and Buddha because both preached asceticism; the faith of Jesus was that of Indian religion and stood in sharp opposition to Judaism. the religion of optimism, not pessimism. 

&gt;Redefining Jesus was not a trend that stood in isolation from the practice of religion, but rather was integral to the widespread volkisch religious movements that arose between 1870 and 1945 in Germany…The volkish movement was brought into the church by individual pastors, calling for a “Germanized” Christianity that would excise the Old Testament and proclaim Jesus an Aryan fighting against Jewish influence.  One of the strongest ideological fathers of the effort was Friedrich Andersen..called for a German Christianity that would proclaim a pure teaching of salvation without “Jewish muddiness”…he rejected the Old Testament altogether, citing the authority of the most distinguished historian of early Christianity of the time, Adolf von Harnack, who himself had written that the elimination of the Old Testament from the Christian canon would complete Luther’s Reformation.

from [The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany (2008) by Susannah Heschel ]( http://books.google.com/books?id=fiCJeNJIhoAC&amp;vq=anderson&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s)

&gt;Strikingly, Christian theologians of the Third Reich reflect the same ironic tension regarding debates about the canon as had occurred in antiquity. Many Deutsche Christen theologians who were loyal to Nazi ideology rejected the OT, precisely because they thought of it as a Jewish book.  But even before the rise of Nazism, the famous Christian historian and theologian Adolf von Harnack argued that the OT should be published separately from “Christian scripture” because it is contradictory to the New Testament—a suggestion resembling the thought of Marcion, about whom Harnack had written the definitive study.  

&gt;Of course, others argued against those theologians who wanted to reject the OT. These Christians—who include both Protestants and Catholics, those who were Nazi party members and those who were not—employed the same kind of rhetoric used by orthodox Christians during the second through the fourth centuries. In their attempt to maintain the traditional Christian canon comprised of OT and NT, they completely disassociated the OT from contemporary Jews, Judaism, and Jewish culture. 

&gt;Cardinal Faulhaber, the relatively moderate archbishop of Munich, preached passionately against any rejection of the OT. In defense of the OT he says:  ”By accepting these books Christianity does not become a Jewish religion. 
These books were not composed by Jews; they are inspired by the Holy 
Ghost, and therefore they are the word of God, they are God's books”.. The cardinal makes three distinctions or disassociations: that between ancient Israel and postbiblical Judaism, that between the OT scripture and other Jewish writings like the Talmud, which are not divinely inspired, and that between what is of permanent value in the OT and what is of transitory value.. Like his predecessors in antiquity, Cardinal Faulhaber's defense of the OT is made at the expense of the Jews, not because he felt any “common heritage” with the Jewish people. 

&gt;One particularly interesting Christian thinker who allied himself with the Nazis but also argued against the Deutsche Christen rejection of the OT was Gerhard Kittel.  Kittel was a New Testament scholar and one of the foremost authorities on ancient Judaism...He, too, made a distinction between the good Jews of ancient times and contemporary Jews who were corrupt, only he did not make the cut-off the death of Christ, but the Babylonian exile. Prior to the exile, Israel was a state with its own laws and boundaries and land. But after the exile, some Jews chose not to return home. Thus, the diaspora led to a wholly new form of Judaism; “Jewry became a religion and a race without a homeland.  Furthermore, because they had no actual political power, they became parasitic on other nations..

Lastly, and perhaps a sort of **TDLR:**

Judith Plaskow discusses this sort of thing in ""Feminist Anti-Judaism and the Christian God"" (Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Fall, 1991), pp. 99-108)

&gt;In the case of the relationship between Jewish and Christian feminists, there are profound asymmetries that make it difficult for us to respect, and on the Christian side, even to perceive, the differences between us. On the one hand, there is the long history of Christian anti-Judaism, firmly rooted in the New Testament, and expressing itself historically in social, economic, political, and religious sanctions against Judaism and Jews..

&gt;On the other hand, feeding anti-Judaism in a different way is the religious and psychological reality that Christians need Jews in a way that Jews do not need Christians.  Wondering what Jews think about Jesus or why Jews reject Jesus as the Messiah, Christians seem to find it almost impossible to hear that Jews don't think about Jesus—except when Christian questions and a Christian culture force them to do so—and that they do not reject Jesus, they are simply not interested in him. The fundamental irrelevance on a religious level of Christianity to Judaism means that Christians taking Judaism seriously as an independent, living tradition must rethink the self in a way that is not true for Jews in relation to Christianity.  What does it mean to affirm Christian identity without defining it over against Judaism? This is a question that the Christian tradition has never found a way to answer. And in large measure, it still has not been resolved by Christian feminists, who have simply turned feminism into a new way of yet again defining Christian identity at the expense of Judaism

Feministing's summary of it is [here](http://feministing.com/2011/12/15/nearly-1-in-5-women-in-the-u-s-has-been-sexually-assaulted/), and the actual study can be seen [here](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/index.html).

Just to summarize: 1 out of 5 women (20.3%) report that they've been raped, and 1 out of 16 men (6.3%). Just so its clear, I've included ""made to penetrate"" in the male rape statistics, because CDC did not count this as rape, but as ""other sexual violence"" (which is very problematic, clearly, but that's not the point right now). 5.2% of women and 0.4% of men have reported ""attempted forced penetration"". For other sexual violence (sexual coercion, unwanted sexual contact, and non-contact unwanted sexual experiences), 44.6% of women have reported such violence, and 18% of men.

So as we can see, men and women have vastly different rates of rape. But it gets interesting with the 12 month prevalence, and this is what I'm trying to understand.

In the last 12 months, 1.2% of women have reported being raped, and 0.4% report an attempted rape. 1.1% of men also report rape (again, this is the data for ""made to penetrate"", which CDC does not count as rape). For other sexual violence within the last 12 months, 5.6% of women report it, and 4.2% of men.

So my question is: why do you think that the rape rates for men and women for the last 12 months are approximately the same, but lifetime prevalence is strikingly unequal? 

I was thinking it might have something to do with the study sample itself, and women being more likely to be raped in certain environments, situations, etc. that happen over their life. The sample that CDC used varied across ages (and other variables). I can't seem to find the median age of participants in the study, but the ages varied from 18 to over 65 (page 102). So my theory (based on purely conjecture) is that women are more likely than men to get raped in certain situations and environments, and these will also be specific to certain *populations* of women. For example, it's well known that [college women are at a higher risk of getting raped](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf) than the general population of women. Also, could it be that women are more likely to get raped under the age of 18 than men are, and that would explain why more women are *reporting* a rape within their lifetime, but this didn't happen within the last 12 months (given that participants are 18 and over)? Is it possible that some of the women are reporting the rapes that happened to them as children? Also, is it possible that men and women are just as likely to get raped when they are in long-term relationships, but women are more likely to be victimized by non-intimate partners (e.g. acquaintances--like date rape)? Could this explain why this sample is reporting similar 12-month prevalences (I'm assuming that since its an older sample of people, more of them are in long-term committed relationships). These are just some of my ideas, I don't really know.

Ever since this data has come out, MRAs have been using it as evidence that ""men are getting raped just as often as women"" (completely ignoring the lifetime prevalence rates). So I think its important to understand why there's this discrepancy between lifetime prevalence and 12 month prevalence.

As a queer woman, my perspective has always been that being an ally means that you treat the people you're allied with *decently*, which in my view means that you are respectful of them and their struggles, you don't actively do things which contribute to their marginalization (Which does not mean you never do such things, but that you do your best not to and, ideally, acknowledge that you've benefited from systems that marginalize others), and you stick up for them when you see others doing things which marginalize them. For example, you say ""I'm not okay with that. Making that kind of joke isn't funny, it's wrong"" if someone makes a joke about trans* people. In general, I don't expect people to become activists beyond taking the struggles of a marginalized community into account when they vote.

This, ultimately, is the difference between my friend's perspective and mine. In her view, an ally must be a serious political activist, someone who spends significant amounts of time devoted to organizing for and advancing the cause, whatever that cause may be. I instinctively balk,  though, at agreeing with this, because after all, I'm not that much of an LGBTQ-rights activist. As a sexual minority, it seems a bit gauche to expect my allies to do more to advance my cause than I do. I can't think of any particular philosophical reason to accept one set of minimum qualifications for allyhood over another, though.

What does everyone here think?

EDITED TO NOTE: I don't want to say that members of any particular group should give anyone some sort of Badge of Allyship(TM) if they don't consider that person to be a good ally. I know that I have a lot of privilege myself, and I'd never ask anyone to call me an ally of their group if they didn't think I made the cut. I'd ask how I could better support them, but that's all.

comment on somebody's physical attractiveness?  
Also, on reddit?",lilhat13,28,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/sf37i/when_where_and_how_is_it_appropriate_to_comment/,"This post got somewhat long.  I believe that everything in this post is generally agreeable.  I do however divided it into two parts.  First, starting points which I believe nobody will dispute (perhaps 2).  Second, commentary derived from those starting point which delves into my personal opinion but generally describes typical situations without drawing a conclusion.  I did hope to provoke a discussion with this post (as we are on SRSDiscussions).

**Starting points**:

1. Shitlords think with their penis and post shittons of comments about what their penis thinks even though nobody asked and nobody cared (especially the person whom their penis is thinking about).

2. Everything that can be described can be discussed (assuming all parties to the discussion are comfortable discussing the topic and posses the maturity/intellectualism to discuss it in a meaningful way).

3. We recognize that humans have social systems for determining when comments are appropriate.  In the real world (off the internet), we have social cues to indicate receptiveness (or lack of).  However, they are sometimes imprecise tools.

4. People are special snowflakes.  What one person may find rude, another might find complimentary, and another simply uncreative.  Write rules for interacting with a random human, not for interacting with yourself.

**Commentary**

The easiest standard is the highest possible standard.  You should not comment on somebody's physical attractiveness without their explicit permission.

The shitlord standard is the lowest possible standard.  You can comment on anybody at any possible time.  (obviously I am not advocating this).

However, it's fairly obvious that most of us live our lives by some medium standard.  We recognize that their are appropriate and inappropriate **unsollicited** comments (it is almost universally accepted that you can compliment somebody's eyes at a bar but not somebody's breasts at your workplace).

I wanted to briefly list what I saw as possible relevant factors and challange any SRSer to come up with a ""hard and fast"" rule or set of rules for when comments were appropriate:

* sollicited or unsollicited comment
* positive or negative comment (compliment vs insult)
* who can hear the comment
* duration/closeness of personal connection
* presentation of the pereson being commented upon

I wanted to briefly talk about the ""presentation"" bullet (read: I wanted to forstall a shitstorm).  The presentation idea is among the most difficult to discuss.  Shitlords seize on presentation (""she was asking for it,"" ""she dressed slutty,"" ""boobs hanging out,"" etc.) and those examples must all be condemned.  **But,** we can very easily find situations where people present themselves in a way which indicates that they desire comments about their physical attractiveness ([/r/gonewild](/r/gonewild) OR your significant other sending a 'naughty' picture with the text ""you like?"").

Speaking to negative comments: it is instinctual to say that no negative comments are allowed.  I think that idea fails to work well in reality.  It is obvious that deliberately hurtful comments are inappropriate but a good well-meaning friend saying ""that brand of makeup turns your skin a weird shade of orange"" is very hard to condemn (sollicited or unsollicited).

The question is being asked for both ""the real world"" and reddit.

**tl;dr:** It's really hard to write simple rules for commenting on physical attractiveness.  Does SRS have any ideas?

**Addendum/Note:** I would prefer answers that are dependent only on the person commenting but not the person being commented on.  The relationship between them does qualify as fair game.  While somebody may be uninformed of whether their actions constitute rudeness, it is dsyfunctional to assume that their actions may or may not constitute rudeness dependent on the reaction from the other party.

In this small part of Mexico the rebels have refused to enact any kind of offensive against the Mexican government or amass weapons which could be used for such a purpose. In this revolution its leader is quoted as saying “You must struggle. Struggle without rest. Struggle and defeat the government. Struggle and defeat the government.  Struggle and defeat us.  If the peaceful transition to democracy, dignity, and justice wins, never will there have been a defeat so sweet”(Johnston 2000). This is the Zapatista Army of National Liberation otherwise known as the EZLN and this group of indigenous Marxist guerillas has in many ways even perhaps unknown to them have redefined the definitions and ideas that surrounding the terms “revolution” and “liberation.” They have forced us to deal with these terms in a new light and on very different terms than we have seen from other groups, ideologies, and organizations throughout the history of revolutionary politics. The major ways overall that they have changed the terms is based on their political organization and goals and as a guerilla movement (structure, relation to civilians, ideology). The effect of this has been to make this small group in Southern Mexico one of the most recognizable and game changing left wing movements in the late 20th and early 21st century.

The background of this conflict and its implications lies in two separate conflicts that have converged in the EZLN and these are neoliberalism and indigenous conflict. Neoliberalism is an ideology that has developed in the post 1968 revolutionary period around the idea that the market can do it better. This idea, which is built up from Laissez-faire politics takes it one step further and asserts that even the democratic process is inferior to the market and that the market can better fulfill the needs of people than the state can. This radical concept is one that gain traction under the leadership of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in Britain. During this same period these nations and other European/ western nations moved to open up markets and deconstruct state intervention in the economy in the 3rd world and at home. Examples of these efforts are debt reconstruction, the IMF (which gave out loans whose default required restructuring), World Bank, and the World Trade Organization.  The most important of these measures in relation to this discussion is the North American Free Trade Agreement which went into effect on December 31st, 1993. The next day the Zapatista uprising began with the rebels taking over major towns and cities in southern Mexico and attacking successfully a Mexican army outpost. Their problem was that NAFTA would break down economic borders between Mexico, Canada, and the United States. This in their eyes would destroy the Mexican worker and peasant and solidify the Mexican government’s position as simply a corporate enforcer of capital. The major driver of that process for them would be American corporations competing directly with the poor farmers and factory workers of the region in grain production, farming of cattle, and light manufacturing industries in the same market.

The other major conflict that came to a head at the same time was the ongoing fight between white Mexicans and the indigenous groups who are descendent from the Mayans and other pre-Columbus civilizations. Much like the conflict seen in other colonized nations in Mexico Mayans and other indigenous groups held little to no power in government and suffered abuse at the hands of armed forces. The history of the Chiapas (the Mexican state within which the EZLN is now in power) in the context of modern Mexican history has been one of oppression from those who are in power on one hand and intermittent revolutions or uprisings on the other. Many of these rebellions and protest movements took on a Marxist or anarchist flavor in terms of articulation of goals and political rhetoric. This background conflict once again came to a head as NAFTA was beginning to pass because many in Chiapas believed that it would be yet another reason for the Mexican government to abuse them for profit. This ethnic conflict coupled with the radically capitalist nature of NAFTA and other neoliberal economic measures created the conditions from which the EZLN rose. It can be thought given the history of the people involved and the politics of Mexico whether a group like the EZLN emerging was just a matter of time. The name of the group itself is derived from that of Eliliano Zapata, a participant in the Mexican Revolution who led the Liberation Army of the South made up as one may guess poor peasants and workers from places like the Chiapas.

There is one other thing to take note of before we go into the discussion about the ideas of revolution and liberation. We have to think about how the meaning of these terms comes about in the first place and how they can be placed within society. In a book called Consciencism written by Africans socialist revolutionary Kwame Nkrumah the author takes an radical look at the notions of philosophy and ideology that can help us better place Zapatismo (ideology of the EZLN) within the context of the world it fights against. Nkrumah argues using examples from Greek and popular western philosophy that philosophies “were reflections of social currents, that they arose from social exigencies”. In other words the philosophy of a society, defined here as the basic character of humanity and its role in X society, is a reflection of real social conditions and conflicts. He then went one step up and expressed that “An ideology, even when it is revolutionary, des not merely express the wish that a present social order should be abolished. It seeks also to defend and maintain the new social order which it introduces.” The relationship is that the philosophy of a society or a group defines the terms on which humans must interact with the world and an ideology is the program that develops out of those terms. Part of those terms is definitions of words and concepts. In the past in America “human” was explicitly defined in the context that being be white and of European descent, thus excluding blacks from being human. That was a philosophy which became contested by the abolitionist movement in the United States with their philosophical assertion that to be “human” should and was not contingent on being white and that blacks too were human and thus deserving of certain freedoms. This is the context on which we have to deal with these terms revolution, and liberation as a reflection of a certain philosophy which in the case of the EZLN is radically different than from even other leftist organizations and groups.

Taking the mindset of looking at these words in the context of philosophy and ideology we can now begin to analyze them. We can begin with the term revolution. The term revolution when talked about in the United States usually elicits one of two ideas, one is our American Revolution (and today perhaps the Tea Party movement) and the other is the stereotypical communist rebel who hates America. Both of these conceptions of revolution very much fits with the dominant order of thing in capitalist American society. On one hand we see revolution being defined as something uniquely American and embodying our intolerance of tyranny. This conception of revolution is built on underlying ideas of American exceptionalism  and that is reflected in modern political movements which assert American society as fundamentally revolutionary and they seek to “revive” or go back to that. On the other hand we see revolution as demonized by the same American society when used in the context of socialism and communism. We see images of Soviet labor camps, bread lines, police states, and anarchy as the possible end results of revolution. This idea of revolution is very much engrained in the current discourse on social change in America where change is akin to revolutionary change (“losing our country”) and is linked to these negative outcomes. In both cases the political outcome is to stifle and counter any voice which either rejects our agrarian, conservative past or criticize current American society as inadequate and ripe for overthrow. The interesting note is that when coupled together what is really being said is that the only acceptable change is one that America proposes and implements which goes along with the self-concept of America being somehow revolutionary even today, such as seeing ourselves as the “defender of democracy in the world” which assumes that we have some special legitimacy being one of the first modern democracies to be able to fill that role.

Now revolution for the EZLN is something very different. Normally even among other Marxist, socialist, and communist groups revolution is seen as a fundamentally violent concept and a course of action that more often than not leads to ruin. This is why countless books have been written on “strategy” so that X socialist movement doesn’t become another Soviet Russia. Too the tools of revolution are seen as the prefiguration of the new society, basically the army, movement, and positions within the revolution are supposed to be semi-permanent. These concepts are seemingly lost on the EZLN as their program is radically different.

The EZLN operates with the philosophy that they purpose is to eventually serve no purpose. In other words they seek to reach a point where the EZLN is not needed for the functioning of the society they are currently trying to create. In contrast to American revolutionism and paranoid left wing revolutionism they see themselves as expendable in the long term and this is shown in a number of instances. One was the National Democratic Convention that they held in August 1994 where Subcommandante Marcos stated (in reference to white ribbons being tied around the ends of EZLN soldier’s weapons “Those ribbons signify the purpose of our weapons; they are not arms to be used in confrontation with civil society. Those ribbons on the guns represent, like everything else here, a paradox: weapons that aspire to uselessness.” Here we see their philosophy at work, that everything is temporary and that the cause is transcendent of the individual participating in it. In this way revolution unlike in the west and in socialist traditions is built on top of not personalities (Marx, Washington, Franklin, or Lenin) but the ideas of the revolution and the faceless sacrifice of the individual will to the goals of the revolution. This idea is also reflected in the organization of the EZLN itself. According to Josée Johnston “Although the military is organized in a typical, hierarchical command structure, strategic political and organizational decisions are made at the community level, rather than by military leaders. The decision to hold the uprising itself was made democratically by the involved Indigenous communities.” The fact that they voted to start a revolution, let alone a violent, armed one is a concept of revolution that is a far cry from how we look at revolts in the west (basically as glorified riots and mob violence). Too in many was this philosophical and material position on this topic seems to solve the underlying problem with mainstream leftwing revolutionary thought while also of course deconstructing the Euro-Amerocentric ways of looking at the same topic and being universal enough that it can be articulated outside the context of the Chiapas.

The other idea that we can deal with in relation to the EZLN is the idea of liberation. Liberation is a term that is often used in class based revolts and even in mainstream politics (Civil Rights Movement for instance) to an extent in the west. When we look at what liberation constitutes and is composed of in the west we have to look at it in the context of  the dominant political reality. Our news media recently have used liberation to describe the outcomes of events such as the Egyptian uprising of 2011 and other pro-democracy movements through the late 20th-early 21st century. What all these uses of liberation have in common is that one, liberation is the freedom to vote in regular elections as seen in the public discourse concerning the Voting Rights Act, women suffrage, and even discussions on vote rigging in America today. All these issues are talked about in terms of securing freedom for people to have their voices heard. The second conception of freedom is seen in how the west looks at countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia, and other nations where one has the same right to vote as in America but capital and corporations are heavily regulated. The breakdown of similar conditions in Western Europe and socialist African states in the 70’s and 80’s is seen as a victory for freedom and a kind of “liberation” from the tyranny of the “state and big government”. What we see here is that even for oppressed groups in the west liberation is constructed within the framework of capitalist democracy, never outside it and even more importantly if you seek freedom from corporate interests or the market itself (reflected in the Bolivian and Venezuelan politics for instance) then instead of promoting liberation you are now becoming an dictator or freedom hating because in our society capital (money) has rights outside its use to society at large.

The socialist tradition rejects this analysis in favor of liberation being idealized as the freedom from capital (aka socialism) and the means of production being owned by the people (logically managed by the state democratically). The reality of the situation is that much like in the discussion on revolution they pre-suppose that the “Party” or “Movement” will be the instrument of liberation. The idea of the “vanguard” comes from this. Popular in early socialist revolutions up till the 60’s it posited that the vanguard of smart, seasoned, revolutionaries would lead the masses to freedom from capitalism and because they know best they can manage society in the interest of the working class and peasants. The obvious paradox that rises from this mentality (which is still present in various forms in socialist ideologies) is that yes your free from capitalism but you’re not free from the ”Party” or “State” which even if it’s democratic and open to all people still has set itself upon your head without your permission for better or worse.

In contrast to these two prevalent conceptions of liberation the EZLN as we seen above sees itself as temporary and is a product of this philosophy and their ideology, called Zapatismo can be summed up in this slogan from the revolt “For everyone, everything, for us, nothing”. The EZLN places itself as the servants of the people versus its leaders. This makes liberation for them the people being free from not a particular government (namely the Mexican one), or from a specific kind of tyranny but from the whole ideological structure that creates the oppressive Mexican government for instance. It’s in other words more about being free from the ideas and psychological constraints of the capitalist system and from the cult of personality and “Party” that has been built up around other socialist movements. For them economic globalization creates conditions where their struggle is seen as nothing more than another instance of a global revolution against capitalism and it’s agents. As I quoted them in the beginning of this paper they see even their organization which itself is a reflection and critique of Mexican society as an eventual roadblock to be overcome. Another example of this conception of liberation is this, “To demand that the revolutionary armed forces not intervene in matters of civil order or the disposition of capital relating to agriculture, commerce, finances, and industry, as these are the exclusive domain of the civil authorities, elected freely and democratically.” This is one of the rights that the EZLN asserted for the civilian governments in the areas where they operate. They passed out papers asserting what they called “Revolutionary Laws” in which a majority of them denoted that fact that the people can reject the EZLN or fight back if they aren’t representing the will of the people and was facilitated by arming the citizens with the same weapons they themselves wielded.  It is most unusual for those with the gun trying to change society to assert that they have no right to change society outside the explicit or implicit permission of the civilian public. Therefore for the EZLN liberation is freedom from any and all systems of control outside those that the people create themselves. As stated above it’s as much about freedom from physical oppression of guns as it is from the oppression of the ideas behind those guns.

What does all of this mean? Why does it matter what the Zapatistas think about revolution and liberation? I believe that simply the fact that they have defended their piece of land for 16 years versus the much more powerful and well-armed Mexican government and kept the support of the people speaks to the power that their ideas hold. They in their small revolt in southern, rural Mexico changed the entire game when it comes to political culture. This is seen in their ideas being exported to other groups in other countries who have applied the principles that were uniquely Zapatista to their very different situations.

All in all much like how America revolutionized the idea of democracy and how Karl Marx changed what could be a viable social organization for human the EZLN and their experience in revolution has given us another way to look at revolutions not as bloody, anarchic toppling of society but as an opportunity to reinvent everything from how we vote to how we relate to the state.  Too they changed the conception of liberation from being something almost exclusively  related to voting or ability to speak freely to something more fundamental and all encompassing. As cultural and political icons they represent a way in which a new generation can interact with revolutionary politics that fits with the new realities of politics and how we have adapted to previous political eras.  The universality of their ideas can be summed up in a quote by Subcomandante Marcos responding to questions about him being gay

“Yes, Marcos is gay. Marcos is gay in San Francisco, black in South Africa, an Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in Israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a single woman on the Metro at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a Zapatista in the mountains.

Marcos is all the exploited, marginalized, oppressed minorities resisting and saying `Enough’. He is every minority who is now beginning to speak and every majority that must shut up and listen. He is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak. Everything that makes power and the good consciences of those in power uncomfortable — this is Marcos.

What I get from quotes like this is that Marco is all the oppressed and  his speeches, ideas, and proses about revolution and freedom now not only apply to the peasants of the Chiapas but to us all. This is the magic of Marcos and the Zapatistas, who can speak to their people and move them to revolution and with the same words also speak to the world and perhaps bring out the Marcos who’s in us all.

This journal article analyzes two cases of revolts and movements against U.S. lead globalization projects. The authors do a deep analysis of the Battle of Seattle and the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico. Using the paper to do an analysis of the Zapatista uprising and its relationship to globalization and ideas of order in the Western sense this paper provides much. The primary contribution to the paper is the analysis of the internal functioning of the EZLN as being mostly democratic and open to the community.

-Marcos, Subcomandante. Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle and Revolutionary Laws. 31 Dec. 1993. Declared Laws and Regulations of the Revolution. Chiapas, Mexico.

These collectively consitiute the first political statements made by the Zapatistas seen by the rest of Mexico and the world at large. In these laws they lay our their philosophy, how they will fight their war and conduct the territory under their control. The upmost importance of these documents are simply in that they’re primary sources from the group itself and I can make clean judgments about them using it.

This speech served as the first quote I saw from the Zapatistas and the basis for my entire analysis of their political culture and aims. The article it’s quoted in is based around looking specifically at the structure of the civil institution of the Zapatistas and making a judgment about their radical democratic society. The paper itself gives much insight into the social psychology of the group and was the best source material on the group by far.

This book was written in the calm before the storm that was the African De-Colonialization Movement. The book’s major thesis is that Africa needs to adopt a new political philosophy, called Consciencism that blends the ideas of christian, islamic, and traditional Africa and uses these experiences to argue for a socialist organization and society. The part of this argument that’s relevant to us is his talking about philosophy as an reflection of the political nature and reality of a society.

I've done very, very light reading on this, so I wanted to bring it before the group to see what some quick minds thought about it. As far as I can tell, zoos have three basic purposes: 

- Research - this is pretty obvious, so I don't really feel like I need to launch into a large explanation of the research programs done in zoos. 

- Education - zoos allow average people to see wild animals with their own eyes and learn about them. The intention is that by educating the public, they will understand the importance of conservation and donate money to the preservation of these species. 

- Conservation - zoos foster the opportunity for international breeding programs of threatened and endangered animals, like African elephants and panda bears. Presumably, these breeding programs have an end goal of re-introducing self-sustaining animal populations back into the wild. 

Issues that complicate these purposes:

- Not enough space for animals.

- Lack of genetic diversity in breeding programs. 

- It is not easy to reintroduce animals into the wild. 

- Zoos promote the idea that animals are a commodity for the entertainment of humans. 

- Research conducted in zoos does little or nothing to shed light on the lives of free-range animals.

1329225474.0,23,self.SRSDiscussion,pp1k0,Reddit and Ayn Rand,,40,17,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pp1k0/reddit_and_ayn_rand/,"I find the relationship between Reddit and Ayn Rand extremely fascinating.

For those of you who don't know Ayn Rand, she's a batshit insane writer who created a ""philosophy"" called Objectivism, which is mostly based on Individualist and American Libertarian ideas (although Rand said she hated libertarians). She thought a man could do everything for his own self-interest and that helping others is immoral and wrong. Rand was a woman but wasn't certainly a feminist, among her beliefs she thought a man could rape a woman if he felt he could gain any kind of advantage from it and the most of her ""love scenes"" actually consist of the ""hero"" raping the ""love interest"", I am not joking. Because in Rand's ""philosophy"", a man can do anything he wants for the sake of self interest. Rand's man is above morals and above society, and more than all above the government. In Rand's crazy world, manual labor does not exist and is not necessary, it's the intellectuals who keep the world running through economy. To prove that Rand was a sociopath, this is what Ayn Rand said about child torturer and murderer William Edward Hickman:

&gt;is born with a wonderful, free, light consciousness -- [resulting from] the absolute lack of social instinct or herd feeling. He does not understand, because he has no organ for understanding, the necessity, meaning, or importance of other people ... Other people do not exist for him and he does not understand why they should.

Rand actually planned to write a novel having Hickman as the main hero. Hickman's claim to faim was to having kidnapped, killed and dismembered a 12 year old little girl for sexual purposes.

I've read The Fountainhead a while ago, what a shit book. The Fountainhead's plot is so insane and nonsensical I can't really find a proper way to describe it; let's say it's a novel about a no-compromises rapist architect doing everything for his own self-interest. The novel has bizarre characters and some passages don't make sense at all,  I read it because I was curious to know more about one of America's most influential ""thinkers"". I couldn't make it to the end because of the horrible writing so I decided to watch the King Vidor adaptation of the novel, which was written by Rand herself and was extremely faithful to the novel (horrible dialogues and it even has the long-ass speech). Still, I suggest everyone to watch the Fountainhead movie because it explains a lot of things about modern society, American and International.

Not let's get to reddit. Reddit **really really** hates Ayn Rand. Every time Ayn Rand pops up, reddit feels the need to hate on her. I've seen some redditors hate on Jimbo Wales, Wikipedia's founder, because of his adherence to Objectivism (I still cannot understand why would an Objectivist found something as altruistic as Wikipedia, by the way). Every time someone mentions Ayn Rand, he gets downmodded, unless he/she's insulting her.
This would be okay with me if redditors didn't agree with every single idea Ayn Rand expressed in her body of work! Let's make a summary.

**Extreme Libertarianism?** Check. Reddit believes every man is entitled to earn as much money as possible without the filthy government trying to get its hand on it. Capitalism is perfect and a redditor would kill himself rather than admitting that the ""free market"" is just an illusion and that monopolies indeed exist. ""It's the government's fault!"", he'll say.

**Belief that society wouldn't exist without the ""creators""?** Check. The ""creators"" for Ayn Rand are the intellectuals who bring progress and ought to make money. Does that remind you of anything? Redditors believe they are intellectuals and, as such, they look down at the ""dumb people"". Ever heard a redditor say that people who want to be parents should pass an IQ test? Which brings me to the next point,

**Disregard for poverty and celebration of richness**. Check! Redditors **hate** poor people. I would say some redditors were poor themselves and much of the hate for the poor is actually self-loathing. Redditors hate poor people, as the eugenics threads usually prove.

**Disregard for morals and laws**. Check. Redditors are no anarchists, that's for sure. But buy, do they hate common decency and morals. Partly because of their hate of religion, which has mislead them to believe that morals=religion, when in fact they are two separated things which often overlap. Which brings us to:

**Man is god of all things.** I'm a green and it's painful to see how disrespectful redditors are for all things non-human. Redditors actually believe technology is the answer to everything and have complete disregard for environmental and animal issues. They'll mock you for being a vegetarian, for example. Ayn Rand had the belief that God does not exist and men (""creators"") are gods, which is something on which redditors would probably agree.

**Sexism, consent and sexual violence.** Check. Rand was a sexist because she wanted the approval of a patriarchal society, she was a special snowflake. Reddit is sexist for no reason but the privilege they already have. And aside from that, their stance on consent issue isn't that different from Rand's. They don't really care about their partner's consent and will often brag about ""false rape"" and ""lowering the age of consent"". Reddit's most recent fiasco and reddit's wave of pedo apologists again proved that redditors feel entitled to pursue their self-gratification in any way possible, with disregard for possible victims or consequences. 

And there are many points which I haven't addressed because of my ignorance, I'm not really an expert on Ayn Rand. This is just what I could gather from reading a lot of stuff about her, interviews, essays, biographies and The Fountainhead.

The only thing on which Reddit significantly differs from Ayn Rand (and maybe the most important) is altruism. Reddit has proven to be pretty altruistic at times. But even the altruism is done in the name of ""reddit did X"". Which isn't a bad thing, as long as it gets good things accomplished, but it often lead to cyber vigilantism in the past.

What I find most remarkable about this whole deal is that reddit would universally agree to hate on a someone whilst agreeing with pretty much said person represents. Steve Jobs is another example, redditors are heavy users of products such as iPhones and iPods and iTunes and never stopped for a moment hating the man after his death. They also do the opposite, see Ron Paul. They love the man but hate pretty much everyone he stands for, except weed legalization. 

I still don't know what conclusion I could get out of all this, I just find interesting that reddit would hate on Ayn Rand with so much passion and still agree with her on so many things. If Rand's ideas are somewhat justifiable for her hate against Soviet Russia and her desire for approval from patriarchists, reddit's beliefs in them is simply unacceptable. The characters described in Ayn Rand books are monsters and I think it's really strange that on reddit there are users who behive like them. All this ""free speech"" and ""slippery slope"" talk is what a true Objectivist would say. There are talks about building a ""reddit island"", which as far as I know is the plot of ""Atlas Shrugged"". And reddit's obsession with legalized rape is what worries me the most. Redditors are actually the result of Rand's insane preaching.  ",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,t3_pp1k0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pp1k0/reddit_and_ayn_rand/,

I don't have a specific post to link to, but we've all seen it: in the same wording every time, as if someone sent out a memo, users here claim that ""Creepy is too often used to describe someone who is not attractive or awkward. What if we're just actually like that?""

Actually, upon looking, I've found [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/pi74y/if_a_guy_used_this_on_me_it_may_just_work/c3plv3z) but will keep the ""general definition"" up there for discussion. The one I just linked reads ""...creepy is so often used to mean a guy that the girl isn't attracted to, or makes moves too fast or too slow for her liking, instead of what it should be, someone who's threatening in their sexuality.""

The dictionary definition of creepy is ""causing fear or unease."" This immediately leads to a few things:

* We naturally judge people by the way they look. Images of ""shady"" or ""creepy"" people are reinforced so that we may associate people with these terms simply because they fit into this image. Of course this is wrong, but it isn't any different than other judgements going on.
* Following up with the definition... if you look weird or are awkward, you MIGHT cause fear or unease! Is that so hard to believe? Different people have different fear triggers and even if you don't think you're creepy, you might be to someone. 
* Addressing the user definition above: ""creepy is so often used to mean a guy that the girl isn't attracted to."" Yes, because sometimes things we're scared of we don't find attractive, and sometimes things that we don't find attractive scare us. ""...makes moves too fast,"" sexual advancements can EASILY cause fear and/or unease. I don't even have to explain this one.
* (Edit:  forgot to address the last part of that definition). ""Someone who's threatening in their sexuality."" This is also up to interpretation. If you stare at me for ten seconds straight, I'm going to find that creepy (causing fear or unease). For some that limit is 5 and for some it's 15 and for some it may be never. Everyone is allowed to set their own limits and boundaries for what they find threatening, whether it be looks or vibes or what we draw on from experience.

This brings me to the point that I doubt ""creepy"" is actually misused. It may be overused to the point of annoyance, but misused to the extent that reddit complains about? Seems unlikely.

Specifically in the case of black metal, the genre is strongly linked with far-right politics, especially in Europe. Is this music okay to listen to, for someone who is committed to social justice? Is it okay if you only download the music and don't go to shows or otherwise monetarily support the band?

I don't really have any answers to these questions, but I was wondering how the rest of the community felt about stuff like this.

2. How does the faultiness of human perception (e.g., attribution errors), cognition (Attention bias), memory encoding, and memory retrieval (egocentric bias, mood-congruent memory) influence the way we perceive our daily life, and color discourse on social justice issues?

I am a woman and I have been a feminist since before I even knew the word ""feminist"". One of my first memories is being upset that I couldn't go outside without my shirt on at 6 even though all the boys did (it was really hot outside). I have had a sense of the inequality between men and women for a long time, and it has always made me angry. Anyway, I also grew up in a pretty progressive family, mainly with my mom and her wife, and visiting my dad from time to time who was always talking about liberal politics. I think all of this may have contributed to this feeling I will explain in just a second. 

Fast forward to now, I have a bachelor's in linguistics but with no job prospects, I decided recently I wanted to go into the medical field, which I've always been fascinated with. So since I've decided I wanted to be a nurse, I've had this stress or pressure or something nagging at me, telling me that I should try to be a doctor instead so I'm not living up to stereotypes about women being nurses and men being doctors. I have this feeling like I somehow need to prove to all those shitty men out there that don't think women really are as capable, that lots of women can be doctors.

I recognize that this in itself is a shitty idea, a) that I'm somehow representing all women by becoming a doctor, b) that I would do it just to be a big ""fuck you"" to shitty guys instead of doing it for myself, and c) that nurses somehow aren't as important or cool as doctors (which just isn't true). But I can't let go of the feeling that I'm letting down my gender and all the struggles by other women to get us to this point, by not living against the stereotype and being a nurse. I should also add that though I know I am intelligent enough to be a doctor, I am bipolar and having anxiety issues that are not really conducive to going through the training a doctor needs to go through. This is almost another reason to do a ""told you so"" by trying to be a doctor and show that even those with severe mental illnesses can succeed, but in reality it does make life very hard at times and would be extremely difficult to do. :-(

Anyway, has anyone else experienced similar feelings? That because of whatever non-privileged group(s) you are a part of that you somehow have to prove to everyone that you are just as good or better as those who are privileged, instead of just being yourself?

Im facing a dilemma and I would dearly love some knowledge on this issue. I read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/usxyo/a_personal_perspective_on_cultural_appropriation/) post and would like some help in understanding it.  

This dilemma started with a debate I had with a cousin of mine, Im Indian and live in India while my cousin has been in the US for about 12 years and just became a citizen. The debate was with regards to a blog post she made about Selena Gomez and some performance of hers in which she allegedly appropriated elements of Indian culture which my cousin didnt appreciate. In my cousins words this just served in exotifying Indian culture and were damaging to Indian culture. I had a problem with this. I didn't agree with the assertion that a flash-in-the-pan popstar could in any conceivable manner damage a 4000 year old culture with over a Billion adherents.  

Now let me be clear about the fact that I was completely and absolutely ignorant about the perspective of Indian-Americans on this issue, my cousin has been trying to educate me on this and I've since learned about Exotification of other cultures, and also about the concept of Cultural Appropriation from a western perspective. This is where I am facing the aforementioned dilemma. The way I was taught about these topics in India is extremely different from the perspectives mentioned in this subreddit for example. Lets take the Selena Gomez issue, most of the reporting I saw in the Indian media was almost celebratory and after Indian-American associations raised problems with it some Indian stars even [came out in support of her.](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-hook/1563147/selena-gomezs-bindi-styling-offensive-bollywood-star-priyanka) Then another example my cousin raised was Julia Roberts and her supposed conversion to Hinduism which was also termed problematic, again Indian news outlets seemed [very positive about it.](http://movies.ndtv.com/hollywood/i-was-intrigued-by-hinduism-julia-roberts-43907) But now i realise that theres a very strong dichotomy regarding this, as most Indian-American or Hindu-American commentary on it looks at it in a more negative manner.   

This is obviously because the Indian-American experience is extremely different from the experience of an Indian in India like me. Most of the media and people im exposed to, tend to take in a positive manner, as a celebration of Indian culture and its greatness, while the immigrant community looks at it as harmful appropriation. Is there anyway to reconcile this dichotomy or am I still being ignorant of an actual problem.

I just want to tease out some parts of this review:

&gt; It's as if Hollywood can't ever stop with the subliminal political messages about the state of identity politics, and just actually make a television show.

The show itself is problematic in lots of other ways, but I've been noticing that whenever a show casts a lot of women or minorities, or somehow tries to depict race relations (as is the case in Defiance), suddenly it's trying to make a political statement.  Just as another example, before Ronald D. Moore's re-imagined Battlestar Galactica came out, there was much hue and cry over its casting of a lot of women and minorities, especially over the characters of Starbuck and Boomer, and that somehow they were trying to be politically correct or something.

I'm not sure that I really have a point with all of this.  I'm just a little pissed of that when women and minorities are actually cast into roles that don't tokenize them, that suddenly somehow the show is trying to ""make a political statement.""

As far the show Defiance itself, it's still problematic in lots of ways--not the least of which is its portrayal of Stahma Tarr, who seems to be a bit of a Lady Macbeth/Femme Fatale (although her husband isn't exactly such a stand-up character either.)

I was involved in a discussion on another forum which started as a callout and got very quickly derailed into a debate about appropriation.

The gist of the argument being made was that use of AAVE by white people was appropriative. I tend to agree, it's used as a lazy way to hit humor beats or reference and create racist stereotypes and caricatures.

But at some point someone pointed out that a US ""Southern"" accent is linguistically closely tied to AAVE in that they share many linguistic features, including some important vocabulary. This is pretty obviously true; the Southern US's history of slavery and the realities of the Jim Crow era meant that the South's language patterns absorbed a great deal from traditional modes of speech used by people of color and vice versa.

That person argued essentially that white people with Southern accents were appropriating the language and culture of Black Americans.

For example: 

*""I don't date Hispanic men""*

or

*""I won't have sex with an Asian girl""*

or

*""Only message me about a date if you are a black man""* 

I see this come up a lot in everyday life, and I try to argue that it's a bigoted point of view, but I'm always just told to lighten up. ""It's just a preference."" Using only anecdotal evidence, I can say I notice this across *all* races, classes, backgrounds etc and in very interesting dynamics. For instance, I once knew a black woman who refused to date black men, she only wanted to date white men, so she wouldn't talk to me. I asked why that should matter, why she makes this distinction, she told me ""It's just a preference."" 

More times than I would like, I've looked at profiles of girls on OKCupid and they would explicitly say, ""No black guys please, sorry just not interested!"" I've always felt in the back of my mind that I'm written off from a romantic relationship simply because I'm a POC. I know others feel the same. I always want to ask what it is exactly that's driving these preferences. My hypothesis is that it's all based in bigotry to some degree.

I'll make another example, this time in terms of religion. I know with certain religious sects, it is *highly* encouraged to date and marry within your family's religion, your religion of birth. And if you happen to date/marry someone that ISN'T your religion then it is encouraged for them to convert. This is prevalent in Christianity and Judaism, and those are the religions I'm most familiar anyway with so I'll just speak about them (hopefully someone familiar with Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Greek orthodox, etc can comment!). I've had a lot of Jewish friends who have basically been forbade by their families to date/marry outside of their religion (and remember with Judaism we can also consider this a culture/ethnicity). Some of my friends were more liberal and didn't care for this, so they defied their families. Others more or less aligned with their families and agreed, yes, ""I can not and will not marry a non-Jew"". As people interested in social justice, is this not a bigoted point of view? And again, I'm not jumping on the Jews or any particular religion or people, but just the idea of refusing to view all people equally and choosing *only* to marry, date or have sex certain subsets.

But what can be done about this? And how do you even argue against this mentality, since *so many people* seem to hold onto it. Speaking personally, it's never made sense to me. I would like to think that I would, and should, openly and happily date or have sex with any person aligned with my sexual orientation. To me, not having a relationship with someone *because* they're Indian, *because* they're poor, *because* they're Buddhist, *because* they have a triangular nose instead of a round nose, just all seems ridiculous and tribalist. I know there might be some holes in my logic though. 

I'm just not sure what they are. I'll also admit that I don't know very much when it comes to cisgendered/transgendered people, so I want to be fair to that. Is a dating/sexual preference the same as a sexual orientation? Many apologists from the ""I refuse to date indians/poor/black/etc"" crowd have used this as an argument to me, but it seems facile, but my point of view is probably biased. This is why I want to talk about the intersectionality of all of these ""preferences"" that people have.

&gt;Are people not aware that movement is a basic human right?
 
For me, this was thought provoking to say the least. Whenever I think about the injustices of the immigration system in the US, I consider the micro level: someone moved here at age 2, *is an American* in every sense of the word except immigration status, but still faces deportation (among many other challenges).
 
But I never considered the notion of immigration restriction itself as a form of oppression - I always thought about the (piss-poor) implementation. Can a nation restrict immigration (in any fashion) without denying basic human rights? Is there a ""cost"" of unrestricted immigration to consider?

This post is kind of navel-gazy but I feel like there might be some ideas in here that are of general interest.

Over the last couple of days I've been taking sexy pictures of two of my room mates (one male bodied and one female bodied) for two separate projects that they're doing.  They're both pretty good friends, the female bodied person more than the male bodied person, and the experience with both of them was generally really positive and fun.  That being said, taking the dude's pictures was a much easier process for me, it was easier for me to communicate and work together with him, and I feel like the pictures we took came out much better. 

Comparing both processes, and the end results got me thinking; queer stuff has always seemed much easier to me. My feelings surrounding my same sex attractions are almost always much easier to process, and gay sex is almost always more fun for me.  I tend to not have as many same sex relationships overall, but I think a part of this is that I have fairly specific requirements in a partner, and the overall dating pool is much smaller for gay men than for straight women.

So, back to the question in the title, it would seem like I might have ended up being more gay if I had come from a less heterosexist society.  Both because there'd be more and better men to choose from in a society like that, and because I'd be carrying around less internalized homophobia and what not.

Buuuuuuuuut, I think a big part of the reason I feel that way is that once you get past the blanket social prohibition on same sex attraction/relationships, the actual brass tacks of queer love are much less comprehensively policed than heterosexual relationships are.  I feel like this is a big part of why queer love feels more natural to me; it might be that I'd be more straight if I lived in a less misogynistic culture where it was more possible/easier to create straight love outside of this narrowly defined realm of acceptable behavior.

Anyway, at some point during this discussion, my girlfriend brought up ""consensual non-consent"" (i.e. ""rape fantasies""), something that she is very into, but that I always have some qualms about (I think it sort of upsets my inner feminist a little, silly as that may be); and she was saying that not only was it more female-dominated, but even quoted a statistic (I think she said it came from a *Feministe* survey or something) that as many as 80% of women report having rape fantasies at some point in the lives, *what!?*


I don't ever judge people for their kinks, and I am fully able to separate the fetish of consensual non-consent from actual sexual violence; but I guess I just always assumed that it was sort of an unusual, fringe paraphilia that only a few really hardcore kinksters ever really got into. I've never had anything resembling a rape fantasy (then again, I'm also almost completely gay, so I don't know if those statistics would really apply to me), and I've really only ever heard two girls I know (one of them being my gf) talk about having these sort of desires. I really don't want to judge anyone for their uncontrollable sexual desires, but I just can't help being a little bit *unsettled* that this is apparently such a common thing; I feel like it has some majorly troubling cultural implications. 

Now I should note that everyone I know who has consensual non-consent fantasies is fully able to separate play from the grim realities of sexual assault (my gf is a survivor, in fact). I *really* don't want to make anyone here feel ashamed about their own personal sexual fantasies or be upset or triggered by all this talk of a *really* difficult subject. But I just have to know, is this really such a widespread thing? Do you think that it is suggestive of some darker aspects of our culture?

I've tried explaining chemistry to them and I've tried getting them to appreciate that you need a word that means ""gender congruent"" and I even got them to grasp that saying ""transgender"" and ""not transgender"" is othering but they've just convinced themselves that cisgender is a slur.

My brain is actually clanking to a halt at how weird it is. I keep trying to explain that it's not an offensive word and even if it was it's so different to the victimisation of transgender people as to basically be a non issue, but they throw back the rhetoric ""you can't define what I find offensive"". They feel they want a separate word they can pick. I pointed out ""transgender"" was supposedly coined by a cisperson but that didn't get very far.

There are quite a few intersections here so honestly I'd be interested in what anyone, regardless of racial or cultural background, has to say about a few questions I have.

First, background: My father was Mexican-American and my mother is white American. I initially lived almost exclusively with my father, moved back and forth more than few times and then, when my father died, I lived the last two years until I turned 18 and moved out on my own with my mother. So, my initial cultural exposure was Mexican, my first language was Spanish, etc. but I ended up growing up more with the white parent. I now again live in the predominantly Mexican area that my father did.

1) What this has basically led to is me not being Mexican enough for Mexican people and simultaneously not being white enough for white people. Pretty much as soon as I was old enough to consider such things, this caused complete apathy on my part for almost any aspect of either culture. My father's side of the family (and a lot of Mexican-American people that I've voiced this to in general) don't like that, but I don't know how else to feel about it when a decent portion of my experiences with Mexican-American culture have been negative (things like shitty looks from older people where I live when I go places with my white girlfriend) and the people that disapprove of my attitude are often the very same people I feel excluded by. However, at times I do feel like sort of an uncle tom about this. Should I feel bad about basically ""abandoning my heritage?""

2) I do identify as Mexican-American, since that's what people call me, but that feels really really passive. I do pull out the race card in certain discussions (cops don't stop being racist pieces of shit just because you don't feel connected to the culture), but I try to keep that confined to things where my experience actually does differ because of it. However, I've always been extremely frustrated with Mexican-American immigrants or those in immigrant families that support restrictive immigration policies. I feel like I might be stepping over some boundaries in viewing and discussing this issue (that I do feel rather strongly about) from a ""Mexican-American perspective."" Is this something that it's appropriate for me to do if I only identify as such because it's what other people call me?

3) Since I don't feel at home in Mexican-American or white spaces, I have gravitated towards other things, that originated from other cultures. A large one has been hip hop (in a way that goes beyond just listening to rap music). I know the subject of invading/appropriating other cultures has been discussed to death here before, usually with hip hop used as the primary example, and lately I have become more sympathetic to arguments against people that aren't black being involved or disproportionately represented in hip hop culture/community, but I can't really shake the feeling that I don't have anywhere else to go. This in particularly has been troubling for me lately because in the past few years I've begun to take an interest in and feel a (very likely unwarranted) connection with things of Black British origin (jungle/garage and British rude boy culture). I fear this may be due to it being similar to things that are attractive to me in African American culture, without me having to confront that this might not be appropriate for me since I don't live in England and thus haven't come into much direct contact with it. So, I guess, what do I do about this?

A well-known (locally) artist was [recently admitted and was convicted of sexual abuse of two girls](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/7168629/Kapiti-artist-jailed-for-sexual-violation-of-girls) in 1999 and 2001. Subsequent to that, he was commissioned to produce sculptured gates for a primary school, which have now been removed, upon the reasoning that it is ""inappropriate for the gates to ""welcome"" children and their families to the school"". 

Now a [second sculpture](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/kapiti/7187367/Second-sex-offender-sculpture-to-be-removed) by the artist, this one commissioned for the local council and a well-known fixture in the community, is going to be removed. According to the [council's own press release](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1206/S00645/iconic-tui-sculpture-to-go.htm), part of the reasoning behind it (apart from the mayor's own strong beliefs) was that some people ""expressed very strong views in favour of taking the tui down, indicating they would never be able to view the artwork in the same way again.""  

Also interesting to me are the reasons given by the dissenting council members: 

&gt;""I am not one for ripping it out. If a gentleman had been drinking and killed three people, would we still be having this discussion? I do not think it should be taken down,""  Mr Cardiff said.

&gt;Mrs Diane Ammundsen said she did not want the tui removed, saying the victims' families and the community should be consulted first, while Ms Gaylor said it was too early to remove it and the police should be consulted.

For a bit of context, the [tui](http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/tui/) is a national icon and beloved bird in its own right. 
 
I think the whole situation is interesting on several levels. First the community's strong reproach for the artist, and that extending to the art itself. Also that the artist's actions have imbued the art with a completely different meaning and context than originally intended. But surely the art still has some value in its own right? I'm not sure I'd like to see it destroyed, especially as it represents a significant investment of taxpayer money (not mine, I'm not local to the area)... but I'm not really sure if there is a solution.

I had a casual conversation with a very close and very good SAWCASMetc friend tonight.  It was about my homosexuality.

Pertinent quotes included ""man, the oppression is just in your head"" and ""why do you give a fuck what other people think?"" and ""I promise if anybody calls you a faggot I'll beat the shit out of them.  That's all anybody needs to do"".

However, while these sentiments were...generally positive he nonetheless casually mocked the idea that gender and sexual minorities face serious discrimination and insisted that if ""we"" would just stop ""caring"" what the majority thinks gay rights would be a cease to meaningful political issue.

My responses were generally well-informed by contemporary theory (lots of bell hooks) but eventually just resulted in a stalemate of me saying: ""you just don't quite get it!"" and him responding ""yeah well?""

Are there resources available for a SAWCASM who is a legitimately good and open person but who in general does not believe in social-level discrimination?

I should note that he does not believe in sociology in general; he often mocks it is as being a fake science.  That being said, he isn't a STEM major--his degree is in Classical Philology (e.g., ancient Latin and Greek) and he is generally accepting towards the liberal arts.

So, does anybody have theory-minimal articles or ways of explaining basic concepts of privilege?  This guy is a good person in general but would not respond well to Invisible Knapsack etc in terms of resources.  I'm just wondering if there are better tools out there.

People with body modifications are often overlooked, perhaps because we have made a lifestyle choice to change our physical appearances. However, choice or not, I believe that the choice of a person to modify him/rself should not have the extreme social consequences that it does. I think that these consequences are a result of a culture that is too judgmental towards and puts too much implied meaning into the act of body modification. Every day on [/r/WTF](/r/WTF), there are frontpage posts mocking modified people and assuming their motivations for modifying their bodies. As a gay, atheist, modified person, I've found that the majority of mistreatment by others in my life has been a result of my body modifications.

So, I've compiled a short ""privilege checklist,"" outlining what I think are some of the principal problems with being modified in an society that doesn't accept these modifications. There is some overlap with white privilege, I think, because that also hinges on outward physical experience. It should be noted that I have body modifications so you can see where my biases lie. I would like to think that this perspective allows me to better see privilege and not instead cause me to see privilege where there is none, but I can never be sure.

**Un-“modified” Privilege Checklist:**

1.	I can easily get a job without worrying too much about my natural physical appearance. People will not see anything inherently “unprofessional” about my body.
2.	I do not have to worry about covering up parts of my body in order to have a job.
3.	I can act freely in public without people assuming that I am looking for attention. 
4.	It is not socially acceptable for someone to make fun of my outward appearance to my face.  
5.	It is not assumed, based on my appearance, that I am involved with drugs.
6.	It is not assumed, based on my appearance, that I am involved with crime.
7.	It is not assumed, based on my appearance, that I am unintelligent, ignorant, or uneducated. 
8.	My actions are not taken as representative of the whole unmodified community. My actions will not reflect negatively on other unmodified people. 
9.	My morals are not ever in question because of my unmodified appearance.
10.	 I can swear, or dress in second hand clothes, or not answer letters, without having people attribute these choices to my choice to not modify my body.
11.	  I can criticize our government and talk about how much I fear its policies and behavior without being seen as a cultural outsider. My participation in a political movement will not be seen as an invalidation of that political movement.
12.	 I will not be suspected of being more culturally similar to a foreign culture than the culture in which I live.
13.	 People will not talk down to me using slurs comparing me to more “savage” cultures. 
14.	 I have no difficulty finding neighborhoods where people approve of our household.
15.	 I can travel to a foreign country and not worry about being harassed by TSA agents or by the police of the country.
16.	 I will feel welcomed and ""normal"" in the usual walks of public life, institutional and social.
17.	 I will not be mocked by my doctor or told that my current problems are a result of my lack of body modifications.
18.	 My psychologist will not tell me that my unmodified state is an issue of body dysmorphia.
19.	 There are role models on television and in history that look like me. People that look like me can be the protagonists of movies.
20.	 I can walk in public without people doing a double-take or staring.

According to [many music critics](http://www.esquire.com/features/music/lana-del-rey-album-review-0212), there is [some evidence](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2012/02/06/120206crmu_music_frerejones) that Del Ray - who released an album in 2008 under her real name, Lizzy Grant, that was later pulled from the Internet - ""bought her way to fame"" and was repackaged by male producers [into the ideal of a 1950s subservient woman](http://themhnews.org/2012/02/arts/lana-del-ray) in order to create Internet buzz around her and market her more easily to a male demographic (listening to a few of her songs leads me to believe that her music is *actually* marketed to teenage girls, but hey, what do I know? I am not music critic, just a layperson). If this was the intention of her management team and producers, it definitely worked in their favor, as there has been hype surrounding Del Ray for months and her album, which was released Tuesday, is currently #2 on the [US Billboard Charts](http://www.boweryboogie.com/2012/02/album-review-lana-del-rey-born-to-die/). 

But why are music critics and blogs (like the problematic ladyblog [Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/5879929/why-do-you-hate-lana-del-rey-i-do-not-know-why-i-hate-lana-del-rey), who basically dedicated **an entire post to making fun of the way Del Ray looks**) deriding her as antifeminist? 

Some are no doubt brisitling at Del Ray describing her image as, [""Lolita lost in the ghetto""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/04/one-to-watch-lana-del-rey), thereby attempting to [compare and conflate herself](http://pitchfork.com/features/why-we-fight/8679-tk/) to a [fictional literary character often mischaracterized as sexually precocious, who was in fact raped by not one but TWO different fictional pedophiles](http://mommyish.com/stuff/lolita-novel-sex-rape-pedophilia-541/). Why would Lana Del Ray want to align herself with infantilization, disempowerment, and loss of agency? Others would would argue it is Del Ray's [problematic lyrics](http://austinist.com/2012/01/24/lana_del_rey_little_girls_and_even.php). Here are just a few examples: 

From *Put Me in a Movie*:

&gt; Come on, you know you like little girls,

&gt; You can be my daddy

From *Blue Jeans*: 

&gt; I will love you till the end of time

&gt; I would wait a million years

&gt; Promise you'll remember that you're mine

From *This is What Makes Us Girls*: 

&gt; This is what makes us girls

&gt; We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first

&gt; Baby can't you see through the tears

&gt; Love you more than those bitches before

&gt; Say you'll remember, say you'll remember

&gt; Oh baby who

&gt; I will love you till the end of time

From *Off to the Races*: 

&gt; My old man is a bad man

&gt; But I can't deny the way he holds my hand

&gt; And he grabs me, he has me by my heart

&gt; [...] 


&gt; Light of my life, fire of my loins

&gt; Be a good baby, do what I want

&gt; Light of my life, fire of my loins

&gt; Gimme them gold coins

&gt; Gimme them coins

From *Video Games*: 

&gt; It's you, it's you, it's all for you

&gt; Everything I do

&gt; I tell you you all the time

&gt; Heaven is a place on Earth with you

&gt; Tell me all the things you want to do 

These lyrics paint the image of [an insecure woman obsessed with the way she appears under the scrutiny of the male gaze](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/01/lana-del-reys-regressive-beautiful-twisted-fantasy/252252/).  

However, some critics believe her odes to female passivity and victimhood are so over the top that they are actually [a *critique* of that subservient role](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2012/01/lana_del_rey_s_born_to_die_reviewed_.single.html). Feminist singer Liz Phair wrote a [defense of Lana Del Ray](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/02/04/liz-phair-on-why-lana-del-rey-scares-rocks-boys-club/) for *The Wall Street Journal*, in which she said the following: 

&gt; Let me break it down for you: she’s writing herself into existence. She’s giving herself a part to play because, God knows, no one else will and she wants to matter in this life. As far as I can tell, it’s working. I went straight to iTunes and bought her new release “Born To Die” in toto (how often do I do that??) because it was more than a collection of songs or a performance, it was a phenomenon. Maybe all the more so because she’s not overwhelmingly talented. The minute I hear the whisperings of “how dare she,” I’m interested. I don’t have to like it, it doesn’t have to be worthy.

&gt; Lana Del Rey seems to be bothering everybody because she allegedly “remade” herself from a folk singing, girl-next-door type into an electro-urban kitty cat on the prowl (of course I like her), and they feel she is inauthentic. I would argue that the uncomfortable feelings she elicits are simply the by-product of watching a woman wanting and taking like a man.

This defense by Liz Phair was, of course, [shocking to some music critics](http://www.spin.com/articles/making-sense-liz-phairs-lana-del-rey-defense), but Phair is not the only feminist who has spoken out in support of Del Ray. In an article on popular feminist blog, [Tiger Beatdown](http://www.tigerbeatdown.com) Flavia Dzodan made [an impassioned plea to feminists to give Del Ray a chance, as she speaks for women and girls who wish the male gaze found them attractive](http://tigerbeatdown.com/2012/02/07/i-sing-video-games-for-the-fourteen-year-old-girl-i-once-was/): 

&gt; How is Del Rey an anti feminist conception of a woman? She is accused of having bought her way to fame (an act of personal agency if I ever saw one), while at the same time, accused of only existing as an object of desire. Yes and? Some women spend a life time wishing to be desired. Hoping to be noticed, wishing the male gaze, a male gaze would find them attractive. Some women, like I did, will never conform to these Eurocentric notions of beauty and desirability. I still, to this day, struggle with it, even though I am in a long term relationship. Wanting to be seen as an object of affection, hell, turning a dude you like on, wishing he would see you as inherently sexy, hot, and yes, perhaps as a sexy “play thing” is not anti feminist. Just like theater and film require the suspension of disbelief, sometimes, feminists can also suspend the theory of objectification for sexual purposes. Is someone who objectifies herself willingly a victim, in any case? Cis men talking about Lana Del Rey as “anti feminist” make me laugh.

I was talking with AFlatCap about this. They said that if the boyfriend tells it in a low pressure subtle way like this:

&gt; If this is going to be a sexless relationship, then I think we should just be friends

Then it's ok. AFlatCap said that if they guy told the girl this though:

&gt; We're having sex or its over.

Then it would be rape. This was the reasoning given:

&gt; Pressuring someone into sex after they say no is rape. Period.

It seems to me like a similar area is if a boss tells one of their subordinates ""I won't give you this promotion unless you perform oral sex."" The sex in this case isn't forced, but it is coerced. Most people would consider this scenario rape, so I guess ""we're having sex or its over"" would be rape to?

We fall into this gray area though. Lets say there's a stripper. She's never directly told anything, but she picks up that she needs to sleep with a certain portion of clients to keep her job. Has the management of the strip club raped her by fostering an atmosphere where these pressures exist?

If the previous example with the boss and the subordinate is rape, then a scenario where the strip club management told the stripper directly ""you have to do this or you lose your job"" would be rape.

In order to do my job well I need to have a very unbiased (as much as you can be with social justice I guess) and educated viewpoint; but many of my peers say I think too hard on the subjects at hand.

The “problem” as they call it is that I question and find issues in EVERYTHING. Any social construction you can think of, I’ve questioned it. A good example is sexism in advertising. I posted a Facebook status just yesterday about the new Dr. Pepper 10 ads which say that it is the “manliest soda in the history of mankind,” while showing a mountain man doing all sorts of “manly” things. I find this offensive, especially looking at their other recent ad campaign which caused such a stir, saying “it’s not for women.” On my Facebook status, a female friend said that this was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be, and that I needed to “chill.” She said advertisers have the right to promote for their audience and that as a woman she is not offended by that. 
	
This isn’t the worst of it though. There are countless examples that go along with this, but for the most part it revolves around this fact: EVERTHING in our lives seems to have some sort of inequality in it, and people are not only being apathetic, but they are allowing it to continue just by becoming bystanders. 

So in looking deep into issues like sexism, classism, religious ideals, politics, etc. and trying to question their social constructs, am I over-thinking social justice, or is this exactly what I should be doing? I will give more examples if need be. Thank you!

for children (age 5ish+), people get piercings, tattoos, and scarification. sometimes it's done to them, sometimes they're expected to do it themselves.

is consent an issue for cosmetic modifications? babies and children can't give informed consent, but should that be required? are people unhappy about the modifications later? does that matter (if they aren't)?

at this point, i'm not sure if i should think of it as totally fine, or just acceptable for reasons of preserving cultural identity. i'm leaning pretty far away from ""it's terrible and you should feel bad"". and ""acceptable for preserving cultural identity"" gives me a pretty uneasy feeling of ""my culture is better than yours"", but at the same time, consent is pretty good.

So I was just reading a comment thread and saw a very reasonable guy using the term Caucasian, and because it's been a long day and my brain is a bit frazzled I got to thinking about why that term bugs me.

Caucasian, in the context of colloquial American speech, seems to exclusively mean 'white'. Looking up 'caucasian race' on Wikipedia it looks like this actually derives from Meiner's bullshit racial typology work, but it occurs to me that in the more general sense, Caucasian actually refers to a group of people who up until recently wouldn't have been classified as 'white', and are still subject to racism today. So in a sense it feels to me like we've co-opted a term describing a mostly disenfranchised people to describe the privileged. And I guess that kind of irks me.

I remember there was a similar topic a few months ago but, I cannot find it.

Personally,  I think trans-racial and trans-ethnic people are problematic because for them being part of an ethnic or racial group is based on performing stereotypical actions associated with those groups. 

I.e. if you like certain things or act in a certain way then your ethnic or racial association lays with a certain ethnic/racial group and hence you are entitled to appropriate culture and struggles of that ethnic/racial group.


**EDIT:** As requested by 3DimensionalGirl here is what I understand by trans-racial and trans-ethnic people:

* Trans-ethnic: people that claim being part of an ethnicity different to their native ethnicity. 

* Trans-racial: people that claim being a member of a racial group to which they don't belong.

To differentiate between ethnicity and race:

I am speaking from first hand experience that straight edge culture has serious issues of misogyny and homophobia within their ranks and when individuals are called out on it they hide behind their clean living tenets and holier than thou attitudes.  Many in this camp believe in many of the same sex negative, false dichotomies you hear from the shitlords.
