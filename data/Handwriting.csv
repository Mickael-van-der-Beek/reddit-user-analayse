TL;DR/""cursive is too hard to read"" version:

  * Correct any glaring postural errors
  * Find an example of the cursive you want to emulate
  * Practice, practice, practice

**EDIT** (30/12/12) - I really wonder how much of the stuff is legible (seems people are just reading the TL;DR version anyway), so I have transcribed it below.

---------------------------------------------------

**In defence of handwriting**

Hello, I have been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and have seen numerous posts from people who want to learn cursive, and people who post their handwriting asking for advice. I was like that once - a long time ago - and I wish to offer my two cents.

**The value of cursive**

There are some passionate detractors of cursive writing, and they often bring up two points. One, it is slow, due to the amount of control and attention needed to execute a legible cursive, and two, there are many alternatives available (such as email and instant messaging). I agree with both these points. Cursive is ""slow"", but there is such wide variation between people in writing block and cursive it is foolish to compare the two, even in the most general sense. With practice, it is possible to write as fast as block while maintaining legibility. This brings me to the next point. A complaint about cursive is its legibility. This is due to a number of reasons, the most important of which is simply the fact cursive is not used often enough these days for people to be familiar with it. Those who use cursive are not doing so for legibility - they do so because it is fast, because they derive pleasure from it, or because they are making notes for themselves. As a result of this, a lot of cursive writing is not terribly pleasing to read, and most cursive writers have a ""backup"" block writing for when they think legibility to others is an issue. Thus, lack of daily exposure, coupled with poorly representative contemporary examples, mean cursive is not often remembered with particular affection.

Finally, the alternatives to cursive. In this digital age, we are used to the instant gratification of sending and receiving information without having to wait for it. The benefits of this are obvious and will not be elaborated. However, even the most ardent proponent of technology must admit to the value of handwriting. Imagine receiving a handwritten ""thank you"" note after a dinner party, a letter from a school friend, even a to-do list from a significant other. Is it that hard to imagine the difference in your reaction, receiving a handwritten versus a typed note? Is it not a special feeling, to know a person on the other end has take the time to write to you, to you and you only, instead of being an unimportant face among a sea of others, where the only effort needed on the author's part is ""insert recipient name here""?

Whether you like it or not, handwriting is here to stay. Maintain a nice looking block if you wish; however, if you are content with that, you probably would not be reading this. Let me now talk about how to get that cursive you wanted.

**Learning cursive**

This is to all those on this subreddit who wish to learn cursive, and those who want to improve their handwriting in general. Firstly, kudos to you. You are the one in a thousand who has paused to realise the importance of handwriting and taken the time to research for ways to improve. You are not alone and most people you see with gorgeous handwriting were once like you. What advice can I give? Unfortunately, there are no magic bullets or shortcuts. As has been repeated time and time again by others, the only way to do it is through constant practice. It is one thing to post up a writing example and request critique and advice, but that can only go so far. The person looking at it is scrutinising but a small snapshot of your writing, and knows nothing about how busy you are, what amount of writing you usually do, your writing posture, and how you hold your pen. You must find your own way, but luckily this is very attainable.

Firstly, correct any obvious errors before you even start. Ask someone close to you what they think of your writing and what you look like when you write. They will tell you if your writing suffers from any glaring deficiencies, whether you sit like a hunchback, or if you hold your pen in a peculiar way. Then, find an example of a cursive you would like to emulate. If you happen to know the author, you may be able to obtain an example of their handwriting alphabet to get a ""clean"" example sheet. If you do not know this person, or if he/she is unfortunately dead (as is the case with many great cursive writers), at least find a large enough writing example to start with. This allows you to look at each letter individually (capitals and lower case), and also how the letters link up in words. 

Then, comes relentless practice. This is often difficult, since, with the emphasis on computers and technology, most people do not write enough during their school or work day. Set aside yourself some time, even just 15 minutes a day, starting with the alphabet letters individually and then try linking when you are happy with how they look. Oh, and, there is absolutely no need to buy ""good"" pen or paper for this. They do not make things easier or faster. A ballpoint pen on a school notepad is more than adequate.

That is pretty much it. As is with everything worth doing, this will take time. Persevere and take it slow - you will always have the chance to write something each day, and when you do, see it as an opportunity to practice. It is not like painting, sports or browsing websites, which require specific tools and an allocated time. All you need is a pen and some paper.

Well, this is pretty much all I have to say. Good luck, and I wish you all the best in your handwriting endeavours in the new year. ",,False,self,t5_2swz3,1356845288.0,,,True,t3_15lk1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/15lk1v/advice_to_all_those_wanting_to_learnlearning/,

I don't know how much use this tool will be, but I wanted to see how much interest (if any) there was. The basic idea behind the tool is that I wanted to practice certain letters, but I didn't want to just write the same letter over and over again. I would usually think up my own words, but that distracted me from actually writing. So, I made this tool.

In the tool, you can select which letters you want to practice, adjust how many words per letter, and change the letter frequency. The higher the frequency, the more it will favor words that only contain the letter you chose.

1356970061.0,36,self.Handwriting,15q755,Improving Printing/Handwriting - A Drafting Approach,applejade,40,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/15q755/improving_printinghandwriting_a_drafting_approach/,"Go get a drink, this is going to be a long one  =)

I've commented on a few ""help me improve"" posts.  I thought I'd collect up some of my thoughts and suggest a slightly different approach, inspired by one of my very favorite subjects that I didn't pursue - Drafting.

I was 12 or 13 years old when I had a personal lightbulb moment about penmanship and neat printing when I took a drafting class in school.  If I could find a community college with an evening class on just Drafting Lettering, without the rest of the drawing stuff, I would SO be there.

In drafting, you have to label things on your drawings.  It's called Lettering.  It's not printing, not writing, but **lettering**.  It's very very specific.  You make every letter the way the template shows it.  If the round part of the letter is almost like a perfect circle, you do the same.  If the stem is this high and is perfectly vertical, you make yours the same height and vertical as well.

It's largely about attention to detail.  This page has a really good analysis and composition of Upright Gothic which, I think, is a pretty quintessential ""hand printing style"" to emulate.  [The Essentials of Lettering - Chapter 2: Letter Construction](http://www.kellscraft.com/EssentialsofLettering/EssentialsofLetteringCh02.html) - about two thirds of the way down, starting at [Fig. 22](http://www.kellscraft.com/EssentialsofLettering/Images/Fig022.jpg).

That tells you the stroke order of the uppercase letters.  The stroke order of the lowercase letters is in a diagram further down the page.  And there are some practice strokes and curves in there as well.  Being Chinese, ""stroke order"" and ""stroke direction"" are of paramount importance.  It makes a much bigger difference than you would intuitively think, especially in Chinese, but I can see and feel the difference in English text as well.  In some of the samples posted here, I can see how it has affected the overall ""neatness"" of look and feel.

When I was taught lettering as a child, there was NO room to do it differently.  We had marks deducted for slanted ascenders and descenders or diagonal strokes not meeting at certain points within reason, etc.  In drafting, neatness just goes without saying.  But a strict lettering style is needed this because you don't want groups of people collaborating on drawings and having 90 different types of letters everywhere.  Make your circles perfectly round if the sample you're following makes them round.  Make your lines join where your sample guide makes them join.  Make the hook and tails look exactly the way the examples do.  Don't put things at an angle when they should be perpendicular.  Attention.  To.  Detail.

Obviously, when it's just you writing something, it's much more forgiving than that.  And some of the extra strokes in those diagrams are not necessary in normal writing situations.  Sometimes, seeing a glyph written in an entirely different way gave me tremendous insight as to how to change my normal printing to make it ""neater"".  The '8' done as two circles, for example, is much easier to print neatly than an 's' and then a backward 's' on top of it.

You'll probably want to relax these rules after you get the hang of it... or it's perfectly acceptable to continue to be OCD about it.  But learn the rules before you bend/break them all.  =)

[Fig. 29 - Letters with Direction Lines](http://www.kellscraft.com/EssentialsofLettering/Images/Fig029.jpg) is a really succinct diagram showing what makes that overall ""neatness"" feel of someone's penmanship.  There is a very clear and very consistent set of direction lines that you can put on top of the whole block of text and all the letters lean almost exactly on those direction lines.  The straight parts of all the letters lean at nearly the exact same slope.  The tangents and/or axis lines of curved parts all lean at exactly the same slope.  This consistency comes with A LOT, as in months and years, of consistent practice and muscle memory.

The samples showing ""messy"" printing/writing have curved straight parts of letters and they curve in different ways or lean at different angles.  Sometimes, this is actually okay.  If the same letter bends/curves the same way everywhere that letter shows up, that could be a part of ""the look"" of that lettering style.

Hello, a few days ago I posted up [some advice for those who want to learn cursive](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/15lk1v/advice_to_all_those_wanting_to_learnlearning/). Since then I have received a few messages about how to write particular letters which were absent in my images, and for convenience I think I will just post a complete example here. 

The way I do lower case letters is pretty standard and conforms to most cursive conventions; however, the capitals are a combination of several styles (plus my tweaks), since I am not happy with how some look in the ""published"" guides. Even now I am not completely satisfied with them (letters B, H, K and Q). It is therefore pretty normal if you do not like the looks of some, so feel free to change them to suit your preferences. 

As always, I would love to know how you guys would tweak some of these letters. There is always room for improvement!

Technology has been blamed for the decline of handwriting skills.  In many school systems it has been replaced by keyboarding.  However, keyboarding is a rather flat single dimensional means of taking notes in a lecture, meeting, etc you really have no quick, easy, or intuitive way of including charts, drawings, unique emphasis, or mathematical formulas of any complexity.  The tablets, such as, iPad, Galaxy Tab, etc are all mostly passive devices mainly for viewing and NOT for input.  Granted, you can add a keyboard, but basically you end up back at the same spot.

I became intrigued by the Samsung Note with the S-pen but felt the size, although huge by phone standards, was just not large enough for actual note taking for class or meeting type of venue.  Enter the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 with S-pen and S-Note application.  This I feel offers the best blend of new technology and natural input skills of handwriting whether cursive or block.  

I would suggest you take a look at Google and demo's of the Galaxy Note.

I hope to see this technology take of and adopted by other manufactures and products.

Note: I have no affiliation with Samsung or other hardware manufactures.  ",,False,self,t5_2swz3,False,,,True,t3_17xvhy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/17xvhy/why_handwriting_may_not_be_dead_skill_and_may/,

I've written a few critiques and helped a few people out, and I think this is a pretty productive, albeit small, group.

But something's been bothering me, and I don't know if it's just me. I'm starting to get turned off by the number of critique requests that get posted (our main traffic) that are uncreative and boring to read, because they go like this:

&gt;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

&gt;What do you think, Reddit?

It's not that I don't like critiquing someone's handwriting, but I have a few issues with this style of submission. Hear me out:

* **It's not a natural sample**. Because one simply posts their alphabet and a single sentence, it's hard for a reader to get a sense of the writer's real problems.
* **They're boring to read**. Some of us *might* be professional scribes or writers or whatever, but I'm sure not. I come here for fun. And reading alphabet after alphabet is not fun for me. I'd be much more willing to give an honest critique if someone posted a real piece, because then at least I'd be getting some enjoyment out of it.
* **It's kind of insulting to the idea of handwriting as an art**. If you ask me, this is similar to a painter posting a chromatic chart and asking for a critique of their painting skills. A critic can only rightly judge when looking at a *painting*, not an exercise; similarly, we can only rightly judge when looking at a *piece*, not a boring old sample.

I found a few posts which I really liked for their samples (I'm a writer so of course I gravitate towards poetry), which also happen to feature beautiful handwriting that still has room for improvement:

* [Part of ""Ode to a Nightingale"" in my handwriting. Open to tips and criticism.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/163b2u/part_of_ode_to_a_nightingale_in_my_handwriting/)
* [Robert Frost, Crane's Crest flourescent, and a 149](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/16aq22/robert_frost_cranes_crest_flourescent_and_a_149/)
* [Can you critique my script? I would like to make it prettier. This is my natural everyday handwriting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/16bt6m/can_you_critique_my_script_i_would_like_to_make/)
* [My functional print handwriting. Tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/16awrz/my_functional_print_handwriting_tips/)

For what it's worth, I think these kinds of posts should be at the top of the front page, along with useful discussions like the [the one about writing in caps](http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/16cnzm/is_writing_in_all_caps_the_same_as_typing_in_all/), this [awesome signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carl_Friedrich_Gau%C3%9F_signature.svg) and the [NYT article on the new Treasury secretary's signature](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/a-new-scribble-on-your-dollar-bill/?smid=re-share).

I don't just want people to agree with me though. I just wanted to start this discussion, because I thought it would be productive for our small community, and a good way to potentially make it much more interesting (maybe increase traffic?)

I like cursive because I feel that it's faster, and I like the way it looks, so I've stuck with that.

I find a big stumbling block for me when it comes to producing legible writing is having a brain fart in the middle of writing a word, and creating some weird squiggle that messes up the legibility. So if yours looks like shit because you do a speed slop all over the page, this probably isn't for you (but I admire your handwriting balls). 

I've recently stumbled on a trick that has helped me quite a bit. I'm curious if anyone else here might have success with it, since it didn't take long for me to notice results.

Pick some text to write down on paper. Take your time and visualize how each word *should* look in your handwriting before you write the word down. Really get that picture in your head. It only took me about 5 minutes to produce writing nearly as fast as my usual efforts and with much greater legibility. I think with further practice this may be promising.

Thoughts?

My grandfather recently passed away, and I would really like to get a tattoo partially in his memory and partially because I've always thought this would be a cool tattoo. He and I frequently discussed Charles Bukowski, as we both enjoy(ed) his work. I thought it would be cool to get, ""The people look like flowers at last..."" tattooed. However, it feels somewhat strange to get it in a random Microsoft Word font, and my handwriting isn't pretty or flourishy. If there's anyone out there who could maybe write this quote and post it here or PM it to me or something, that'd be wonderful.

I'm loving this small community, and excited to see it grow. Been trying to submit as many productive posts/replies as I can, but now it's my turn to pose a question to the experts—I certainly am not one.

Recently I have started handwriting letters, and am taking great pleasure in doing so. The ones I've done so far have been on office-supply-store parchment paper, which is thin enough for me to put heavy-lined paper underneath as a guide.

Such has been my method until last night, when I tried writing a letter on heavy paper made for letters and the like (it looks nice and is very smooth, and is supposed to last a long time as well). Having no better idea for how to write straight, I grabbed a ruler and made lines in pencil. This worked well (erased them after, of course) but I could see it getting tedious if I wrote a letter longer than two or three pages.

So my question is this: are there any tricks or tips for writing straight lines on heavy paper? Is this the sort of thing which can be effectively trained into one's own writing? Are there lights which can *project* straight lines?",,False,self,t5_2swz3,1354833870.0,,,True,t3_14dyxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Handwriting/comments/14dyxj/on_writing_straight_lines_handwriting_on_heavy/,

Symptoms include: handwriting that looks like it was done by a kindergarten student, cramping of hand and/or pain while writing, random use of capitol letters, inability to write cursive, etc. Generally, dysgraphics can *type* just fine. And we're not dyslexic, nor do we have problems organizing our thoughts into a sequence...but it all goes to hell when we try to hand-write them out.

Often, dysgraphics are seen as lazy and careless by teachers, get low marks on written examinations, or are held back due to poor penmanship. Long-term, dysgraphics suffer from esteem issues, depression, poor self-image and anxiety. Many develop extensive coping mechanisms to avoid hand writing altogether.

I'm dysgraphic. Can't handwrite for shit, despite the efforts of tutors, teachers, doctors, neurologists and all of the remedial classes, stern warnings, pleading, and more than a few smacks on the knuckles with a yardstick I got in the educational system. 

Anyone else? Not gonna post handwriting sample...just take my word for it.

EDIT: Well, this is amazingly validating. Want to share coping mechanisms? Like, my signature is never the same. I carried around a piece of paper in my wallet where I signed my name 20 times to ""prove"" it was always different so I could cash checks etc back when that mattered. And I don't have any note paper around in the house, and it's always awkward when a visitor asks to borrow a pen...cuz there aren't any. I've had my kids fill out forms for me ever since they were about 8 (humbling in the extreme). Way too many more to list here. How do you all deal?

I was never any good at handwriting at school and have developed my own sloppy style which I frivolously scrawl while at work. I would love to improve and having read a number of posts have recently ordered Write Now. Unfortunately I'm in the UK and shipping/holidays mean I probably won't get it until the end of the month.

In eagerness and advice around these posts I bought a Lamy Safari today so that I could start practising. The main things I want to improve:

- consistency

- w, especially when succeeded by h

- r, just because I find it difficult to use in cursive!

- I've recently changed my f so that the lower swirl (don't know the technical term) is infront instead of behind the downward stroke

- 8, I can't get away from creating odd leading lines on the top arch

Samples of my writing, first with my new Lamy and second with my girlfriend's cheap calligraphy pen. Bonus points if you can name one of my favourite books from which the excerpt is taken.

P.s. I'm not sure what is going on but I always find that nibs on all fountain pens I've used can be quite scratchy at times and the ink flow is not particularly constant. I tend to apply a fair amount of pressure while writing, more than just resting my hand on the page.

And so I come to the core of this post-Where have people found to be the most efficient place for their eye: Directly on the tip of the pen? Behind the pen and watch the ink flow out? Do you actually draw the lines with your eyes and have the pen follow the path of your eyes? Do you use your peripherals? Or do you see the words in your mind or perhaps on the paper itself, and your hand just simply traces the letters?

And despite the specific nature of this questions, I would like to hear what you guys have to say simply because A. It'd be interesting, and B.

So from what I've gathered so far (and please correct me if I'm wrong), it's a good idea to write with the larger muscles in your arm and shoulder, not your fingers. Also, as a leftie, the paper should be slanted so that you write towards your body.

I've done both of these the exact opposite way since I learned writing, especially the classes in cursive messed me up since my teacher advocated a hook grip to avoid me smearing the ink.

Hiya r/handwriting! 
Sort of a new years resolution of mine to improve my handwriting as I have recently landed a 
job that requires a lot of writing.
A habbit of mine is to use capitals letters, but i've not been able to shake it off for a few years (22yr/old now). 
Any critisim much appriciated but I'm mainly after pointers when it comes to technique.
The lower case example shown I find myself  
really needing to concentrate whilst doing, but as you can see its still not consistent.

I'm going to put aside 30 minutes every couple of days to try and nail some of the cursive i've seen here.
I signed my name ('Joe Payne') at the bottom also which i am aiming to look more appealing to the eye, any help there
would be great!

Used a fountain pen and then a biro below.

Help!

My current everyday writing is more like printing with some of the letters joined and a few elements of cursive, and it is becoming more illegible with every passing day.  I know that the standard recommendation on here is ""write more slowly, form your letters completely"", but my handwriting is sufficiently dire (so much worse than anything I have seen here, or even in /r/shittypenmanshipporn!) that I think I should start again from scratch and relearn how to form the letters.

So ... in your opinions, what choice of style/script would be best to maintain speed and legibility?  I know that the traditional cursive that I learned in school isn't fast enough for me.  I have been considering seeing if I can learn joined up italic script, as it's like printing, but with the joins.  The basic letters in some of the English round hand examples in The Universal Penman are legible and beautiful, and I was wondering if it would be possible to achieve a simplified version of that.

Any links or recommendations would be helpful!  I spent quite a bit of time looking for information, examples, or practice worksheets online, but haven't found a lot of resources.

I'm a big fan of penmanship and love browsing around subreddits like this to see some great calligraphy skills and how you guys improve upon it. 

I've recently been looking for someone with immense calligraphy skills to design a new text-based logo for my band Me Versus I. Right now our logo is used with a free computerized font that we got off of Freefonts, which doesn't make it very genuine. I'm designing a custom drumset with the folks over at SJC in Dudley MA and I need a new less-computerized logo for the bass drum. 

Anyone with a scanner or a PC art tablet would be great. The logo we have now itself is pretty simple, it's a cursive-based text logo with lots of sans. The font used is called The King and Queen, which I'm a big fan of, but it just doesn't compare to a unique original hand-drawn logo. 

Your art will be going on MY bass drum to be toured around the US with, so please use your imagination! It won't be limited to just the bass drum, either - it could be going on t-shirts, stickers, CDs, and loads of other merch. You could make one, or two, or even five logos, and the one we choose we'll be forever in their debt. Think of it not only as doing a favor, but an experience to improve upon your skills as a writer and a calligraphy artist. As musicians, we know all about improvement and trial/error.

Below is the logo as it stands now. You can use this as a reference and to get an idea of what we're looking for. It's elegant but sharp and rugged. It should be aesthetically pleasing, but practical and easy to read. Nothing too feminine, definitely more masculine. Think about a rose with chest hair.

I love you /r/Handwriting!

Some background:

I am a 24-year old male and can type 90-100 WPM according to the online typing tests - but can't hand-write worth a crap.  Ever since high school, I've been told my printing is difficult to follow.  Most people prefer that I write in all-caps.

I stopped having anything to do with cursive handwriting after 5th or 6th grade because the teachers stopped requiring its use.  Since then, I have pretty much forgotten how to form many of the letters, and I often have difficulty reading others' cursive.

I apologize for the use of a ""thick"" pen - it's all I have here at work.  Here's my sample - how do I rate?  This is by far the most I have written by hand since leaving high school 7 years ago.

I used a Lamy Safari with their black ink for the first two samples. The one in the notes I'm not sure about, but it was probably the same Safari along with a Serwex 162 filled with Baystate Blue.

The first sample is some handwriting that I'd normally like to have, but rarely have the time to actually write at that slower pace. The second sample is some writing where I write a lot closer to the speed I have to in class when taking notes. The last sample is a real world example from notes I have taken in my livestock production class. I probably should have used some lined notebook paper for the samples, but all the loose notebook paper I have is not very good. The printer paper is much more pleasant to write on, even if not much of an improvement.

A few critiques I can say myself is that my handwriting isn't very uniform. I often rotate my pen a lot when I write, and each angle warrants a completely different writing style, all the way from very straight, small handwriting to bold, extreme italic handwriting. You don't see it as much here but there are some extreme examples I was too lazy to find. I also need to work on just general letter formation and other things.

Also, please ignore any grammar/spelling mistakes. I wasn't really looking for that when making the samples.

My fiancé and I are trying to DIY our wedding invitations ourselves, and venturing into letterpress to do so. I found a great font to use for the envelopes, thinking they'd work well for the invite design we want, but after designing, really didn't love the way it looked.

Any beginners (or seasoned professionals!) out there want to lend a hand? Would you be interested in just writing our names out for us to use for our invitations?

I thought maybe it would give someone a good chance to write something other than ""The quick brown fox blah blah blah"" if practicing.

If not, that's okay! If so, then you're a great great person and you have a kind kind heart :)

I've seen a few apps on the store for this but not quite what I was looking for.

Basically, I would like to repeatedly (1) trace a cursive letter, (2) possibly provide my own template shape from a vector graphic format, and, most importantly, (3) get an evaluation score measuring how close I got to the reference shape.

It seems that many apps provide (1), but I failed to find apps that also provide (2) and (3).

I'm cringing at the moment hoping this is both allowed and not looked down upon amongst /r/handwriting.

I'm currently in the process of trying to forge a 'business' - nothing I want to essentially make money from, just something to 'get me out there'. 

As you can probably guess by now, i'm looking for someone to create a cursive font-logo for myself. I can't write in cursive to save my life - inheriting some sort of labourer genes from my father who taught me to write in caps through and through. 

Anyway! I'm willing to pay a small price for your help if you are into that sort of thing, through Paypal - but honestly I wouldn't especially *want* this sort of business to blow up. It's more a practice of my self-management and creativity skills. I really don't have much to share around, if you require any money, please say upfront so I can arrange for it. (: 


The name i've decided upon is DEMpixels / dempixels. It has some inside significance and I also like the sort of spin on 'them' that is takes too.

If i've sullied the subreddit, please delete this!

**EDIT**: I suppose I should explain what i'm after - but take these as very slight guidelines - I would much rather appreciate your own style shining through than mine for this.
*DEM* actually stands for something and as such, I would like capitalised - but non-capitalised also works beautifully too. I've not decided properly myself yet so feel free to experiment.
*pixels* I would like non-capitalised, it's essentially just pixels.

Dearest Reddit,
This is my current writing style. I'm left-handed, and I'm currently writing with a terrible pen.

It's the only one I could find.

Anyway, I've been told I have terrible handwriting skills. These people aren't wrong, to say the least. I discovered /r/handwriting, and I was hoping you fine ladies and gentlemen could assist me in this art of handwriting.

It took me about 2.5 minutes to write this. I'm going quite slowly as I'm writing.

[This is my normal speed.]
[This is my slow, intentionally legible speed.]

So, any pointers?

(And perhaps reply in writing? That is why we're here, isn't it?)

I'd love to get a tattoo of the following lyrics from a Cynic song:

""From my great arteries - to every blade of grass - a universal path.""

I envision it being on three lines like that and running down the inside of my forearm (so an aspect ratio of 4x1 or 5x1 roughly).

I'm thinking of [something like this](http://www.personal.psu.edu/afr3/blogs/siowfa12/handwritingimage.jpg) but a bit more ""scripty"" or cursive and with longer flourishes or lines coming off it (I'm aware that my handwriting-related vocabulary is likely sorely lacking). I'd like it to look organic, almost like it is going to grow and reach out to the space around it, without being illegible. The hard thing I've found is that cursive or scripts can tend to look feminine, and I'd like it to look neutral or masculine.

[I guess if you can capture the spirit of this in a script I'd probably explode.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7llndJlqu1qj48wuo1_1280.jpg)

Therefore, I have a strong belief that readers subconsciously judge a person's writing based on their handwriting. If it's clear, obviously they have a easier time reading it, they enjoy the process more, and hence, are more likely to give a high mark. I looked into calligraphy before and there were theories about having the lower-part of the ""y"" and ""g"" and the higher-part of the ""h"" and ""l"" longer makes you seem more assertive or something like that...
