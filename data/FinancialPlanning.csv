1370483813.0,9,self.FinancialPlanning,1frhdo,Just got a new job that allows me to plan ahead financially; need advice.,yougottagopherit,12,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1frhdo/just_got_a_new_job_that_allows_me_to_plan_ahead/,"Hi Reddit! I graduated college in May 2012 and have been working in a limited-term employment position for a non-profit since August making just enough to scrape by in the city I live in on a very strict budget. My limited-term employment ends June 28th, and on July 1st I will be starting at a new job. I will be receiving a $2000 bonus for finishing my term at my current job, and my new job pays me almost double what I am making now - I have written out my (slightly more lenient) budget for my new salary and I will be living quite comfortably, since I am used to being on such a limited budget.

My credit score is ""excellent"". I currently have approximately $18,300 in debt for my student loans, and I have been paying off the minimum payment of $200 each month since December when my grace period was up. I have $450 in credit card debt (I have two credit cards, but only use one, and the limit on the card I use is $500). Those are the only debts I have. I currently have about $500 in savings - I have currently been using my savings (which came from my grandfather's life insurance policy payout he specifically gave me to pay student loans off) to pay the $200 minimum payment each month.

I know that I will be using part of my $2000 bonus at the end of my term with my current job to pay off the rest of my credit card and bring the balance to $0, $600 to pay my dad back for car insurance, and another $150 or so to buy my boyfriend a nice gift, since I am usually unable to in my current situation and would like to do something nice for him (these obligations total $1200). The rest after taxes will either go into savings or towards my student loans. What I need your advice on is:
 
* What I should do with my extra money - both the remainder of this bonus, and the additional money I will have after expenses are taken care of each month with my new salary. Right now, my current plan is to continue paying (out of my paycheck, not my savings) my student loans at $200-$300 per month and put $400-600 a month (these numbers may fluctuate depending on emergencies or ""surprises"" I need to buy) into savings until I have two months of ""take-home pay"" saved up. After I have two full months saved, I want to switch the amounts I am paying to loans/putting in savings. According to my calculations, I should have two full months saved in 9-10 months. If I switch what I'm paying heavily on after this, my loans should be paid off in less than 4 years. I am also considering opening a separate savings account for the remainder of the bonus I receive after paying off my credit card/car insurance and buying a gift and keeping that as an ""emergency fund"", even though it will probably only be a couple hundred dollars. 

* 3% of my paycheck before taxes will be going into either a 401k or a Roth 401k. My 401k will be 100% vested. I'm not quite sure what either of these mean in comparison to each other, so if there is something specific that is better about one than the other, that would be great to know. 

Sorry for the very long post - I just am very happy and relieved that now I will have the ability to save and make sure I am secure in the future, and want to make sure I am making smart decisions. I would love any advice you are willing to share. I also don't know much about investing - if anybody thinks that's a path I should go down, I'd be happy to learn about that as well. Thank you!

She said I needed even more money for things. She was already talking about paying her carnote with my college savings fund once my account opens (she can't access any money until my grandmother, who set it up, gives it to me).

I have $27,000 in my bank at this moment.
I have a car that is completely paid off but it has 165,000 miles and is worth about $8,000 on KBB.
I will be living in Miami alone with one dog.
I have $0 in debt! :D

I would like to budget $5,000 for a trip to Europe this August.
I would also like to save to go get a masters/phd in the next five years.

My question is how should I be splitting up my $3,500 a month. Like how much should be going to rent; how much to saving for future schooling; how much for going out in Miami?

We're 26F and 36M, looking at buying our first home. Neither of us have any debts or obligations, and are both working. We both have approximately $40k saved.

We've found a home that we're in love with that's RV is $385k which we could easily afford with our weekly incomes. I'd be paying less than I do in rent at the moment.

Then we got thinking...

We want to have kids in the next few years. Everything I've seen leads me to believe that they're expensive little buggers. Where we live, childcare can be pretty expensive and we wouldn't be eligible for any of the govt handouts that lots of young families get because our collective income is too high.

Neither of us have experience with these sorts of financial commitments and want to know what our priorities should be and how it would be best to proceed.

Do we:

1) forget the dream house and buy something smaller and cheaper that we can pay off much faster

2) go for the dream house because we plan to live there for 20 years, and just struggle through the years before the kids go to school

3) delay having kids for a few years (I'm young, my eggs'll keep) and burn through as much of the mortgage as we can

4) something else we haven't thought of?

UPDATE: We went and had a proper look at the place today. While it is gorgeous and has a lot of what we need, we came to the conclusion that we'd really be hamstringing ourselves a bit by moving there. We're going to look at cheaper places that have most of what we want (and maybe invest in some improvements? It'll depend on the house) and look at jumping in the shallow end - not right in the deep end!

Are my parents idiots? 2nd mortgage facing foreclosure, 1st mortgage in good standing, bank will re-finance 2nd mortgage of $36K over 10yrs if they pay $12K down. They also have liens on property of at least $7K. They close on Thursday! Just found out. AAAARRRGH.",aremyparentsidiots,10,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/131oj1/reddit_help_are_my_parents_idiots_2nd_mortgage/,"Title is quick summary. I just got a cursory look at the contracts 20 minutes ago. My mind is reeling. I'm thinking they're about to hand over $12K for a horrible ROI - that it would be better to declare bankruptcy, which will delay the foreclosure (and being out on the street), close the business (it's unsuccessful), while they sell assets (this is tricky, but craigslist and cash sales are a way to do it?) and try and regroup and move on to a new life based on my dads salary alone. Cut the albatross loose! Here's the long:

Mom is bad with money and math. She has a small business and they live on site. It's a 3 unit building plus 1/2 acre land. 1 office, 2 apartments, she uses both 1bdrm apartments to ""live/work"" within. Rest of land is used in agriculture/greenhouse/nursery retail operation. Value $75-90K on a good day. We've tried to sell it via craigslist, but no one is buying the established business, or leasing it. Might be able to scrape $10K by selling off all the assets on land (greenhouse structures, plant inventory, drip system, computers, etc), it likely has a higher valuation but holding out for more $ isn't a gamble they can take considering the time line. They have $10K cash in hand. That's it. Dad has a decent paying job for the area ($50K/yr). His extra money floats her small business expenses. She has never made profit in 20 years of operation. Their AGI for IRS is $12K/yr, filing jointly. They live in poverty, but don't see it that way. I'm okay with living in poverty as long as they're happy, but I'm horrendously worried that they're about to get screwed by their banking institution and they're bad enough with their finances to let it happen again. Having $10K in hand is a rarity, and only due to a windfall inheritance. 

They have $60K in other debts from the business and personal combined, including tax liens on the property (at least $7K+ in liens). The paid the 1st mortgage on time, but the 2nd mortgage my mom just... didn't pay. -sighs- The 2nd mortgage term expired with a remaining sum of $36K balance on an original $50K loan. The 1st mortgage has a remaining balance of $35K on an original loan of $75K and is on track to be paid off on time. The other tax liens are at least $7K. Again, the value of the property is maybe $90K on a good day.

The 2nd mortgage was ""called"" and mom couldn't pay $36K. She didn't do anything. Didn't tell us for 3 months, while she looked for ""other financing options"". Then she get a notice that the bank will foreclose. Mom and dad went to the bank and said ""we have $10K we can give you if you give us 5 more years to pay off that 2nd mortgage."" The bank said ""okay"". However, not in writing. Then the banker they were working with ""quit"" and a new banker came on to the scene. This banker says ""okay, i'll give you 7 years to pay it, for 1% more interest."" Mom and dad say ""okay"". Then the banker says, ""wait. we see you have at least $7K in tax liens here. We need another $2K for fees and interest. Pay us $12K and we'll give you a new 2nd mortgage."" This new 2nd mortgage will take the original outstanding debt on the now 'called loan' from $36K to $28K (approximately) - even though they are paying $12K. They don't really have $12K to pay. They close this Thursday. I read through the lien and collateral notice, and it is a waaaay more complicated document then the original one they signed - it includes wording such as ""if a new lien is placed on the property you have 15 days to discharge it, or the lender can claim loss on their security"" or ""lender must be notified of any insurance payments (regarding damage from wind/fire/etc) within 15 days of causality, and has the right to intercede all payments and apply to indebtedness or to fix claim"". The deed also says the lender has the right of ""sale"" - which makes me think they can sell the property whether mom and dad are in default or not on the 2nd mortgage. The issue about paying off any new liens within 15 days also has me worried, knowing their tax history (mom likes to make payments and budgets her life around payments, vs indebtedness).

What would you do? What details can I share that make this complicated financial scenario easier to solve for the betterment of my parents? I'm lucky and frugal and not in a position to give them $ to solve their problems, but I'm on my way up - own my own business, and I don't take dumb risks. They're 60 years old each and their sacrifices and dumb financial decisions gave me the education that's helped me get where I am today (the $60K PLUS loan they took out is now at $110K... they didn't know what they were signing up for, I didn't either, I was just a kid.). I love them. They are kind, honest, and gullible people. If they are homeless, they will live with me, until they get on their feet again. But man, are they idiots, or what? Am I being too harsh? Do I let them loose the $10K they have in hand, to the bank, in this 'vain hope' (my current perception) that they get to keep their property and in 5 or 10 years sell it for $120K or sell the business for $250K and use that to retire, or in 7 years, when dad retires from his current job, they still have their land and mom's business, and he can work it as supplementary income to his social security check (this is something they've talked to me about as a hope)?

TL:DR Beloved parents have to pay $12K to get a NEW 2nd mortgage in the amount of $28K spread out over 7 years (fixed 5.5% APR) to keep their current home and small business going (after defaulting on the original 2nd mortgage of $50K w/variable 2% above prime - unpaid balance was $36K). The biz is a failure, the property is worth maybe $90K on a good day. The 1st mortgage has $35K balance with a variable interest rate (2% above prime) and 5 years left to pay it and is current. The 2nd mortgage has some crazy 'you're screwed' terms. I think parents should declare bankruptcy, which delays the foreclosure, get their shit together, sell what they can as quietly as they can, and start fresh on my dads salary of $50K/year (due to mom's failing biz, their AGI is $12K/yr). They close on the 2nd mortgage THURSDAY. I'm terrified. Just found out.

I am freaking out because I don't want to end up spending all my money that I have saved on my parents bills. We lived a nice middle class life while I was growing up and now I worry they are going to end up homeless. I need help to find out what resources I could use. I am willing to pay a financial advisor to help sort out all the bills and such but not sure what kind of professional to use.

I make about 2800-3000$ a month.. have roughly 600$ max in bills per month (car, insurance, internet and cellphone), but I have 9000$ in credit card debt. This mostly accumulated over time with internet and stupid purchases that I paid off, but the interest just kept piling up. A major chunk of it as well was an emergency car repair for a family member that they took a year to pay back.

I recently moved home to my parents to save money and to pay down my debt, but after nearly two months of being here, I find myself having not paid down much at all, and Im starting to feel extremely anxious/depressed about the situation.

Can someone provide some advice as to how to get started on paying this down? Im sure that sounds stupid and/or obvious, but I'm truly lost on the best plan of attack.

I've got about $150/mo. in my budget (beyond my budgeted savings) that I feel I could contribute, so that's $1800/year. Right now all of my savings, including this ""extra"" money is going into an interest-earning checking account (2.51% APY), however I'm wondering if there's a better option. As I said, my job doesn't have any retirement plans of any kind, and I'm already contributing the max to my Roth.

I was bitten by the travel bug back in college and spent time living abroad. I eventually returned to the US and finished my BA. I got a job at a big corporation, and  by my mid 20's heard the road calling again. I quit, packed up, and took a job teaching English in Asia.

My plan was to spend a year working and living on each continent before returning to the US and getting back to the ""real world"". I've been in Japan for 7 years, loving it, but still dream of that big travel adventure.


**Now**

I plan to leave Japan and travel before returning to the US to settle down. I aim to continually travel and work, seeing the world while leading a nomadic lifestyle. Hopefully, I can do this for many years, seeing the world before returning home a burnt out and used up shell of a man.

**Questions**

* I have $72,000 USD in savings. How do I best invest it? I plan to use it to start a company or go back to school when I return to the US. 

* How to best earn money while traveling? Income streams I have considered: teaching English (7 years of experience), scuba instructor (not yet fully certified), balloon twister (balloon animal busker guy - just began studying this), web developer (just began studying this via online courses).

I currently have a 401k that I have been contributing to for years [20+] I never really thought much about it, just kept putting in the max or near max.  My employers plan only allows us Fidelity funds and I have been in Contrafund FCTNX, Freedom2020 FFFDX, Growth&amp;Income FGRIX, and Leveraged Co stock FLVCX.
All of these have expenses under 1% with the highest being .85% FLVCX.

Now recently I watched the Frontline show about indexed funds vs managed funds and was wondering what the hell I was doing in these funds vs Index all these years.  Even though the funds I am in have lower expenses than the ones they talk about in the segment it's still worrying.

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/retirement-gamble/the-retirement-gamble-facing-us-all/

So now for the questions, I am able to move the current Fidelity funds and the % contribution to some Fidelity Spartan Index such as FSITX, FSIVX, FSEVX, FUSVX which have very low Expenses .07 to .17% but I don't know what will happen when I do this.  I currently just log into my account at Fidelity and I can make changes but I don't know what the impact would be, are there fees involved with moving to another fund within our plan?  I guess I will call Fidelity but I wanted to ask here first to see if there are any pitfalls I need to watch out for.  And is it too late to start doing this in your early 50's?

I'm 5 years into a 25 year mortgage, and I've already reduced the amortization from 20 to 18 with prepayments and such.

I'm leaning towards the 5, as I don't think paying almost a full point of interest to hedge against &gt;5% rates is that great of a deal. I also prepay a nice sum biweekly, so I'll be destroying my larger principal much faster at 2.7 than at 3.6.

My boss gave me the following information:

* Consolidated Profit and Loss Statement [Technical] for 2010, 2011, 2012 for all 9 services the insurance company offers
* Overall administration expenses for 2012 and the proposed administration budget for 2013 [APPROVED]
* Annual company budget for the company, and it's breakdown by branches and departments [APPROVED]
* Proposed departmental structure for an expansion plan [APPROVED]
* Proposed structural breakdown per department [APPROVED]

With all this information on a few sheets, he asked me to, and I quote:

* Show him numbers of how he can get from current to the proposed.
* Provide him with a small report which he can show to the Board and get 'it' approved. 
* ''Look'' at the departmental/staff breakdown.
* Show him numbers.
* Expand the sales, customer service, close current departments if they are not ''profitable'', expand current departments and provide this information in a condensed form which he can show to the Board of Directors.
*Show him numbers of ''here to there'', by making a business plan.

Reddit, as a college drop out, I have worked my ass off to get to this point from the position of an office helper. 

I simply have no idea what he wants me to do, or how to do it. I have no understanding of how I can make a business plan with the information provided to me. Heck, I don't even know the kind of report he requires.

I do not have enough knowledge to even figure out the technical names of the procedures I am supposed to imply which I could have searched for on Google for templates or examples. 

I read several topics on how to make a business plan but after asking him if that was what he required, he simply repeated the information above and threw my research on where the business industry is headed away.

The only technical name I have come across is the ''break even analysis''.

Please Reddit, help me figure out what to do. I have no idea. Nor do I posses the knowledge. I have 48 hours to provide him with this information, ''on an Excel sheet''. He doesn't need graphs or a presentation or a discussion. He ''needs to see the numbers''.

I had to swallow my pride as a hard-working employee and post here under a new account. 

If you want to ask me what I have done so far, then my reply can be summed up in a word: nothing. Because I don't know what to do!

TL;DR Boss asked me to make a business plan with the information provided above. I don't know what I have to do.

I would really like  to know the best ways to raise my credit, steps to paying off credit cards, options I have with my student loans, etc. Any guidance or advice is welcomed, I’m just looking for some help to plan the next few years of my life!

A bit of background.: 
-	Employed since June 2007 as receptionist, later promoted to manager.
-	College Graduate with debt
-	Living in southern California 

From July 2007 to January 2012, I was extremely careful with my credit and balances. I had no late payments, I never went over my credit limit, and had a savings amount that I was happy with. Thankfully, I was able to pay off my car loan. After losing our family business in later 2011, things began to slowly go downhill. Plain and simply, we’ve been struggling to barely make ends meet – faced with a situation between putting food on the table and paying a credit card payment, there was no question in my mind that my finances would have to take a blow. 

Things are beginning to look up again and I’m hoping to regain control of my finances and work towards becoming debt free. Here’s a list of my debts owed. 

Delinquent (No payments made since August 2012)
-	$15,403.00, student loan.
-	$2,543.00, credit card.
-	$1,811.00, credit card.
-	$687.50, traffic ticket.

Again, my goal is to get a handle of my finances, begin saving, and improving my credit score. Currently, I work 40hrs a week @ $13 p/hr. If you could please help me with any advice on basic structures or anything really, I’m open to it!! 

Thank you. It was therapeutic enough to write it out.

1370284698.0,8,self.FinancialPlanning,1flhos,Need help on school loan consolidation please.,kristaladele,9,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1flhos/need_help_on_school_loan_consolidation_please/,"Hello Reddit – I was hoping some of you might be kind enough to offer me some financial advice please. Here is my situation:

I have two school loans- 

The first is a Stafford loan. Originally, it was $9000.00. It has ballooned to well over $12, 000. I am not currently making any payments on it and it is most definitely in default. 

The second is a private loan through Sally Mae. Originally, it was $10,000. As of today, the loan is $11,418.94 with an interest rate of 11.75%.  I am making monthly payments of $150.00 on it. I have a cosigner on this one. According to Sallie Mae’s cosigner policy online, I must have 24 consecutive on-time payments to apply for my cosigner’s removal and am two payments away from that mark.

My goal:
I would like to remove my cosigner from the Sallie Mae loan, consolidate the two loans into one, pay off the loan as soon as I can, start rebuilding my credit, and try to tackle my credit card debt. 

My questions:
What is the best course of action? Is loan consolidation the way to go? If so, what is the best company/bank/way to achieve the consolidation? I would have to do this by myself. A cosigner is not an option.

I should mention at this point that my credit cannot be described in any way other than “horrible.” My credit score is 521 (as of 2 weeks ago). When I was 19/20/21 years old, I thought it would be a GREAT idea to apply for a bunch of credit cards so that I could augment my shoe collection and buy furniture for my new apartment. I was receiving credit card offers in the mail on a regular basis (I was also a raging alcoholic with compulsive spending issues). They were handing out $9000 limits and approvals like candy. At the time I was making roughly $1000/month… seven credits cards and $40,000 in credit card debt later (a fabulous shoe collection that I could not need less), and here I am today (now 5 ½ years sober with MUCH better spending habits)… I should mention that every single one of those credit cards is in collections. Also, I deal in cash/debit only. I do not have any working credit cards. If I do not have the money in my bank account, I do not buy the item. No exceptions.

Reddit- I am a 27 year-old female. I have a stable job working for the State of California. I want to take responsibility for my debts and the financial mistakes I made in the past, but I do not know where to start. I would like focus on the school loans for the time being because 1) The Stafford loan is through the Department of Education and they have the power to garnish my wages and tax returns (I want to avoid this if possible); and 2) The Sallie Mae loan has a cosigner and I do not want to hurt this person’s credit any more than I already have (the debt to credit ratio is already upside down on it, so I need to get this person off ASAP).

Any help would be so greatly appreciated. If you need any further information or clarification, please let me know.

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give.

TL;DR: I have two school loans that I would like to consolidate. I have a cosigner on one of them. I have seven credit cards in collections and a credit score of 521. I would like to know what the best course of action is to start hacking away at this debt, focusing on the school debt first. Thank you.

After all taxes, I bring home around $700 a week and all my bills including groceries are about $650 a month. I've been saving all my money since November, the only debt I have is student loans which right now are $20,000 and I still have two years left on my degree so it'll be close to 30-35 by the time I'm done. 

So far I've been putting all my money into a regular savings account. I have my emergency fund built up already and have enough to last me for 6 months.

A couple things I've been looking at is buying some land and and establishing a place I can live long term as right now I rent. I've found several places around where I wan to be with cheap-ish land that I could pay off in a year or two. With some land I would be able to establish some type of garden and animals which would cut down on my grocery bill and could also provide an additional income source. I grew up on a farm so I know what I'm getting myself in to.

Since I'm still in school my main question is should I go ahead and start paying off student loan debt even though I don't have to start paying for two years? Or would it be okay to go ahead and invest in land and establishing a place to live for the future so I have something that is mine?


Also, I've looked at investing but I just don't know if I feel comfortable with taking the risk of losing money. So any types of low risk type stuff I could do would also be appreciated.

So since I graduated back in late 2010, I'd spent about a year and a half in relative poverty. I don't ever want to go through that again. 

I now work as a contractor, and have a number of jobs wrapping up that would amount to a very good sum. I could probably pay off all of my student loans with it. It's that good. I consider myself talented and hard-working, but I also consider myself very lucky.

During my time in poverty, my debt obligation kept me chained up, and I felt squeezed to the last drop. It kept me from taking off and trying to find new opportunities abroad, taking risks, and the like because I knew I had to put something towards it at the end of every month. I feel constricted by it even now. I just feel very tied down. Every month, the interest that accumulates is about 1/3 of the monthly payments. It feels like usury to me. (I know it isn't.) 

I think it's evident that I have a whole score of psychological reasons why I want this gone immediately. But I've worked hard for my money, and again, no matter how in-demand I feel my work is in the market, lurking in the back of my head are fears that the economy will tank again, I will have to try to live on savings, etc, etc. 

Furthermore, I know that I should weigh the present value and the future value of my money. But I have to weigh it against my debt that's accumulating at 8%. FYI, the remaining sum is around $20k.

So r/FinancialPlanning, what do you think I should do? Should I at least take a deep stab at it so that the interest accumulates at a smaller fraction of my monthly payments? Is the amortization period set by the debt agreement somehow the most optimal? I have too many emotional factors going into this that I don't trust myself to make the proper assessment.

Thanks in advance.

Wife and I moved a couple years ago, have a couple kids now, and she recently quit her job and has just started a new part-time position at a new business, so she can spend more time with our children.

Throughout this whole ordeal, we have managed to scrap together a bit of savings, and I'm wondering what is the best course of action for our money to be as accessible as we need while still working for us efficiently.

A few of our details:

* Currently have about $10,500 saved up
* In March, we will be taking somewhere between $2000 and $3000 to start a remodel of our Master Bath.
* My bonus this year should be around $1000.  We expect to save that towards a trip to my wife's sister's wedding this summer.  It needs to be easily accessible, but I'd like it to be separate from our standard checking/savings account until its needed in July.
* I'd really love to look into some basic stocks and mutual funds.
* We won't be putting all of the savings away somewhere, I'd like to keep a couple thousand in our standard checking/savings account as a buffer.
* Also, we need to look into starting college funds.  We have about a thousand set aside to begin this, and we'd like to start making monthly contributions.  Again, I feel like it can do more for us.

We should be able to contribute around another $5000 to $10000 per year.

So, Reddit, what are my options?  What is the yield vs. accessibility vs. risk?  Best companies?  Worst companies?  Time to start looking at financial planners?

And no, I don't think under the mattress is the best place.",,False,,t5_2qwze,False,,,True,t3_19epsp,http://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/19epsp/where_is_the_best_place_for_my_money/,

A) accept an unsubsidized loan for $2000 which will cover most of the rest of the year. or B) ask my (not so financially well off) family to lend it to me and pay them back when I can (summer).    I really feel bad borrowing from my family but I'm worried about the interest accruing of the loan and being able to pay it off quickly when I'm done with school.

Essentially I'll be getting something to the tune of 1.5 mil and I'd just like some advice or maybe even just some things to read about managing such a large sum, instead of just doing something like just adding a few dollars each paycheck like a lot of advice.

I know that currently she has about 800k liquid invested into a lot of different stocks/mutual funds/etc and quite a lot of it pays dividends.

This is more than my yearly salary, and way more money than I've ever had at one time.  I'm 30 years old. I have been diligent about funding a Roth IRA over 10 years, and plan to buy a new house in the near future (1-2 years).  I think maybe $100K of this would go towards a 20% down payment.  
So my question is, where to park these funds?  Savings account yields are pretty abysmal, but I am loathe to do anything to risky (especially with that $100K part).
Bonds? CDs?  Any thoughts out there?

Edit: I should add that I currently have a mortgage at 3.5%.  Maybe the best option is just to pay down principal on that?
