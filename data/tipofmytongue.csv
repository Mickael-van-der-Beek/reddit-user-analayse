Every day a few hundred come here to the lost-and-found of /r/, and ask for people who they do not know to find things that are precious to them and that become in turn precious to others.

Whether it's a remix of Starry Eyes, or a video game from one's childhood, or a song that goes ""dah tahhh dah dah daaaahhh"" or a comic book page that explains why Hawkeye feels he must not miss even a single shot, it's always an object of something that imprinted itself on a person's memory, something that made its way into someone's inner chamber, something that moved them so much as to find it once again with the help of strangers on the Internet but brethren of Reddit.

It is when the question is asked that the finder's search begins. Sometimes they too know the exact location of this lost memory, this moving moment, and solve the question for the searcher and other finders to see. Sometimes the quest can last hours or even days, scouring the Internet, scrounging through loads of data and images, combing vast caverns of forgotten .com's just to find that one lost object, or sometimes (as I've personally done) visiting a place itself to find that which has been lost.

Tried a few times, tried Reddit gold, I'll send *edit $40 PayPal* to anyone who can figure out the below book 

**EDIT if you can reference the point the book you are recommending it would be helpful, instead of just saying ""TOM AND THE WALL"" would be better like ""In Tom and the Wall there is a part where they get in a boat with a lantern guiding them and here is a photo I found showing what I mean"", or something more to go on that just a title

Someone posted this awhile ago, I resposted it few months ago but have never been able to figure out what it was, it went unsolved and has been killing me because I read the same book and just can't place it even after more time on google then I want to admit, anyone know what it is? Here was the first post:   Note I put what I can recall in *my edit* format

""It is a child's book. Possibly from the 60s, 70s, or 80s *my edit, I think it was from the 80's, I read it between 1983-87* . I only recall two things from the book. One is a child reading from a book with warm golden light pouring out. The other is a child in a small boat with a lantern hanging from an small hook above him. The boat is shaped like a chair with a tall back that curves around with the hook for the lantern. *MY EDIT I believe I remember this boat with a lantern hanging off the front of it going through a cave* If anyone knows what book this is I would be forever grateful. I loved it as a child. I seem to remember the book is sort of a compilation of stories. It may not be a single story.""

I could be totally wrong, but I think it was something like this book takes the kid through 3 tales, that are slightly interwoven IE NOT just like Chapter 1. the lantern does this. Chapter 2. the lantern and boy are now randomly in Egypt       

I think the book flowed like he had the 1st adventure, and it lead down a river to another, and then down the river through a cave,  note that it might not have been exactly 3 stories, but something in that area, and finally back in his bed at the end

EDIT I checked out Wynken, Blynken and Nod on Google images and none of them triggered anything so I'm pretty sure that is not it. Also it is NOT the Gloworms books


EDIT the person that first posted it tried again a month ago, here is his post

http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/15rmfk/tomtbook_a_book_from_my_childhood_but_i_think_its/

Here is info I believe is relevant from the first post I reference above, from user lurker_becomes_lurkd

This photo really jarred my memory, I think the boat did look something like this  ""http://i.imgur.com/Hbym1.png""

lurker wrote this "" I just remember the warm glowing light that seemed to play a strong role in the theme of the book. The light represented knowledge I think."" this triggered a strong memory with me

This has been driving me bonkers for 14 years.,,305,38,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/pgsgl/tomtbookdoes_anyone_know_what_the_title_of_this/,"My mum and I read a book about 14 years ago that we both loved and then rather stupidly lent it to a neighbour...who subsequently moved. Neither of us can remember the title; I've tried Googling it, I've tried book forums, my mum has tried ringing around bookshops. Every so often one of us with bring it up purely for the purpose of tormenting the other.

Please please pleassseeeee help me find out the title and author.

THE PLOT:

It starts at the beginning with a man seemingly committing suicide by jumping off a building. Then, his son comes along to investigate to find out why. His father was involved in some way with a large pharmaceutical company.

Time rewind to backstory for the CEO of the company: when he was a child/adolescent, he became interested in devil worship. He finds a ritual knocking about somewhere and decides to test it out. He buys a rabbit from a pet shop and steals some sacramental bread. He uses them in the ritual; kills the rabbit, defiles the host...but it doesn't work. He tries again (not sure what he does differently), has to go back to the pet shop and tells the owner that the rabbit died and he wants a new one. This time the ritual is a success and this causes his father to die of a heart attack (which was the intent as he has a rabid hatred for his parents). There's a little more backstory on him; he joins a devil worship 'club', which, for all intents and purposes, is just a big shagfest of orgitastic proportions involving making their way around the available women in the group.

Right, snap to the future. We now have a woman about to give birth; something goes hideously wrong. The baby has a placental cowl and when it's removed, the baby's eyes are fused into one in the centre of his head. Oh my, he’s a Cyclops! Chaos abound!
So the guy investigating his dad's death hooks up with another woman, they start creeping about being all Holmes and Watson blah blah blah. Turns out the company has been trying to create babies with a genetic predisposition to psoriasis (and other diseases) so that they'll have to pay for the cures that the company is churning out for exorbitant prices.

Ends up with the two of them running around in the pharmaceutical building and she gets caught. They take her down in an elevator to the secret basement level labs (of course there’s a secret level) where the rapscallions do all their dodgy testing. We get to the point where they're about to pluck her eyes out of her head and replace them with eyes from massive GM frogs (this is fucked up shit). They escape somehow and set off the fire alarm system in the labs; which floods the area with halon gas (expelling all the air), killing all the lab techs/doctors down there in the process.

Very nearly at the end… somehow, the guy and this CEO dude end up in the middle of the desert. They're mishing to the CEO’s devil worshiping hang-out cave for some bizarre reason. The CEO is using his freaky mystic devil powers to make the guy forget what's going on; the guy has water on his back and he makes him believe that it's gasoline and he can’t drink it. The dude forces himself to drink the water that he knows is really there and once he gets past the taste of the ‘gasoline’ he starts to get more clear headed. They reach the cave; which is covered inside with sigils, upside down pentagrams, the usual. Then the two of them have a face-off. CEO man is bustin’ his devil power moves; other guy goes into meditative state and slows his heart beat down. The line ‘One…beat…a…minute’ pops up in there somewhere. He stays like this and then releases a load of energy in one go and BOOOM, CEO dude go bye-bye.

I seriously hope someone knows the name of this book

**EDIT:**  Reddit, I don't believe it, you've just solved 14 years of irritation in less than 24hours. The book is [The Alchemist](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Alchemist-Peter-James/dp/0451179978) by Peter James.  Thankyooooouuuuuu! (I just rang my mum and she made a squeee noise down the phone).

I saw this years ago while in Japan 2003 and found it again in the states later on, but cannot find it anymore!!  It definitely looks like an old VHS camera quality..

If I can provide more info I will!!!

Update: so it's color.. Recorded on a obvious home VHS camcorder.... He is tan, sitting at a table to the camera's right... The camera notices his hand first, then his head ( which is elongated and looks like the diva from fifth element without the tentacles)...

When you clicked on any of them, you got a window full of tiny screens, I think one of them had a cloudy sky background behind the screens. You clicked on it and you got an interactive short movie. All cheap animation. You know, it might not even be a game at all. I remember one of the shorts was nursery rhyme of Three Little Kittens, setting might have been a tree house at night.

Remember, speaking about a show that ""you saw when you were 9"" isn't that helpful because others don't know your age or who you are. Try to avoid that.

I finally found a spare few hours to sit down and code a robot which will walk the submissions every so often. When the bot determines that your submission has been solved, it will place a green check-mark next to the title to denote that it has been solved! Overall, it should help this community direct more of its time to concentrating on solving things instead of clicking around looking to find unsolved posts.


Note: The robot, named cssbot, will only watch the past 72 hours worth of submissions. Let me know how it is running and any suggestions you may have to make it better.


For those technically inclined, you can fork it [here on github](https://github.com/bweck/cssbot).
I will be tweaking it, cleaning it up and documenting it better over the next few days - I just wanted to get it out in the wild now. PM me if you have any questions on the code.

I can only remember brief snippets of it, and they may not be in the right order - obviously what I'm going to say will include Spoilers, so, leave now if you don't want to find out what happens in this obscure, possible TV Movie from the early 90's.... ;)

It's going to end up being an episodes of Neighbours or something, I know it...

A kid, in a car, with Mum and Dad in the front - driving down a snowy (mountain?) road. They skid on the snow to avoid a horse (which may or may not have been pulling a cart). They hit the horse, and it kicks through the windscreen and kills the Mum.

I think.

Blah blah blah Now Single Dad tries dealing with The Kid and mourning his wife.

This is where it gets hazy: *SOMETHING* to do with timetravel.

I'll let that sink in........

Low and behold the very end of the movie, the Dad or Kid wakes up, hearing the piano being played in the house - it's the song that The Mother always used to play...implying that they've managed to 'change' the past, *or* it wasn't time travel, it was to do with being able to change certain things...

Yuma heely boops veely veely booma yuma blockeya
or even more phonetically: 
You-mah hee(or high)lee boops Vee-ly Vee-ly Boo-mah You-mah Block-ee-yah

She was German or Irish or both, but born in America. My father was raised in New Jersey so she probably lived her life in a similar area. 

EDIT: [Voice recording as requested](https://soundcloud.com/craftyintentions/yuma-heely-boops-veely-veely)

PLEASE keep in mind that this is ME saying what my Father told me years ago from what he remembers when he was 4 or 5 years old.  Though he seemed to remember it vividly, and I repeated it to myself hundreds of times so that I would never forget - he seemed so fond of the memory. 

Thanks so much for any help.  I'd love to be able to tell him what it meant, and then maybe do a silly cross stitch of it - not just of the phonetic version. I'll be so impressed if someone figures this out.

EDIT 2: Wow guys!  Thanks so much for the attention this is getting, and trying so hard.  When my Dad told me about it, I wrote the phrase down as best I could on a piece of paper, but yesterday my 2 year old spilled something on my wallet and the paper was ruined beyond recognition.  After almost 40 comments here, I sent my Dad an email requesting a little more information about it - his own phonetic pronunciation, and whatever he can remember about her.  I'll update when I get that info, and I'll wait to repost to a different translation subreddit until I have HIS phonetic interpretation. 

It's like a game of telephone across decades of time. 

EDIT 3: There's a twist!  Here's what my dad says: ""It was my Mom’s Mother- My Nana.  You got it pretty right. It was something like: “Yuma highly boops veely veely booma yuma block-eeya.”  Supposedly it was related to something in Yiddish or Pennsylvania Dutch (German). She also sometimes said the more understandable “Cheese and Rice Got Damp in my Cellar.”"" 

I remember him mentioning the ""Cheese and Rice Got Damp in my Cellar"" thing - aka ""Jesus Christ God Damn it to Hell"". 

So that's the Irish/German Branch of the family, but I couldn't remember which branch was what.  So she was German - but she grew up in Pennsylvania and the language is either Yiddish or Pennyslvania Dutch - which I'm sure any German would consider NOT GERMAN at all.

The original thread had a question like 'what is it like to be a beautiful woman'. The one comment was pretty close to the top.

It was a woman who was either ugly then got pretty, or vice versa. I think it was started out pretty and went ugly. She grew up thinking all you had to do was smile and that your personality makes the person. But then she figured out the world really does run on looks, and personality doesn't matter if you're ugly. She described how it was a shocking revelation and that she did not see it coming at all.

Jackaltoad found it for me! [It's this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqtE1VEcME)! Thank you Reddit, you've set my soul at ease!**

I used to hear this song all the time back in 1999 when I lived in Oklahoma. It was played on 93.7 KSPI The Spy. It's a college station out of Stillwater that played 'alternative' music at the time.

The song was sung by a moody female singer with a warbly guitar sound. The lead up to the chorus went something like:

*Many days just to see you falling, spinning wheel*

The timing always worked against me on never hearing the name of the song or singer/band. I'd be driving somewhere and arrive at my destination as the song ended or something like that. 

After a few months of not driving a whole lot, I'm cruising around and put on the radio only to discover that 93.7 has switched to a goddamn pop station! Over 10 years later I still think of that song, but I can't figure out what it was and the lyrics I recall aren't enough to show up on a google search.

Please help me Reddit, you're my only hope.

Edit: Thanks for the help so far. I'll follow the advice given and post something with me humming the toon later today. Does anyone know if there's a way to look up top radio singles from a given year and genre? A list of 'alternative rock singles from 1999' might help.

Also, the closest singing I can think of that sounds like that voice is the singers from Morcheeba and the chick from Sneaker Pimps.

1369141434.0,166,self.tipofmytongue,1erez6,[TOMT] All I can remember is this scarring movie scene from a film I accidentally stumbled upon as a child. NSFW description.,tempacount1,212,46,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1erez6/tomt_all_i_can_remember_is_this_scarring_movie/,"Remember being in a hotel in Mexico flipping through channels and stopping at a movie network channel to briefly witness a scene from this movie.

This is going to be incredibly weird-sounding because the memory is convoluted in my head and I was young when I watched it (around the years 2000-2002). The film is probably not from then, just thought I'd give a little more information.

Anyways, here's the description: There is an alien or monster. And inside his cave/lair there are a few people he is keeping as prisoners. One of them, I think it was a woman, is strapped to chair similar to the one you find at the dentist. Another prisoner is definitely a man. The alien/monster then proceeds to take a hand drill and tortures her. 

I was so scarred by the scene, that I quickly changed the channel, but it has haunted me for many years since.

EDIT: I'm pretty sure that the scene is the opening scene of the movie if that helps at all. Also pretty sure it's an alien (black and humanoid) not a monster.

EDIT2: Judging by the many comments, this is not an obvious one. I guess that means we can assume it is a slasher B-flick as opposed to a popular blockbuster that I might have not known out of ignorance. And to reiterate, I'm almost certain there was an alien involved. Hope this helps a little!

FINAL EDIT: Well that's that then! /r/horror figured it out. The movie was called Evil Aliens!

It's a fairly famous song I am pretty positive. But no way I ever found out the artist or the name. Its really good.
I recorded the main part of the vocal, I really am bad at singing but I think if you know this song, you will recognize it.
I have no idea about the lyrics other than it's a female singing and possibly 90's. Could be earlier. It was played a lot of times on radio etc.
Offering 5$ on paypal who solves this.

edit: 
guyz I did another recording, almost the same but a little better https://soundcloud.com/m-7/song-im-looking-for-ages-rec2/s-wd7Ey. I am positive if you know the song you will recognize it by this (horrible) recording. !!! thanks a bunch so far. lots of plays in the clip

My ideas:  

* allow a great deal of trustworthy users that frequent the site to mark posts as solved.

* if a certain number of any other users type 'solved' to respond to an answer (2 or 3), have it automatically mark as 'solved.'  [this would be kind of like the old system with 'solved' responses to answers, but for any user instead of just OP]

a few aspects to focus on as essential based on the original points plus feedback:

It was a terrible romance novel. The main character is a French girl. She is bathing in a pond in the woods when of course a handsome man rides by and decides to rape her. After this, she runs back to her family to report the rape. When the guy shows up at their family home, her brothers force him to marry their sister despite both of them protesting. Regardless the marriage takes place, and the new husband says he has to leave and get on a ship. The girl follows him, and boards the vessel with him against his wishes. On the journey they begin to fall in love, but he is shanghaied by another ship and forcibly conscripted. The girl is left to the crew, who continuously rape her until she has a miscarriage. Later on she is rescued off the coast of America by pirate Jeanne Lafayette, who begins to help her put herself back together. Unable to return his affection, she eventually is reunited with the first guy who raped her, and tries to escape him by buying her own house. She is eventually engaged to a foppish man who was one of her suitors. The sister of this man does not like her, and plots to have her removed. Her fiance's sister and cousin conspire to kidnap and sell her into slavery. The cousin is having a gay affair with her finace, and the cousin rapes her before she is sold off to slavery. Finally she is given over to a cruel slave master who, you guessed it, rapes and beats her. She attempts to run away, earning herself the brand of a runaway slave, until finally she kills the slave owner and escapes, only to be discovered again by the very first rapist, who rapes her again. Seeing that she does not enjoy this (surprise!) she finally makes a deal with the former fiance's sister (who somehow also knows the first guy) to go back to France, where she gives birth after being told she would never have children. Eventually the first guy finds her in France and the two become a couple.

They end up finding work on a farm. They earn money but the cost of working (lodging) is always greater than their earnings. They cannot leave farm until debt is paid off. There is an African-American friend who ends up working with the family on the farm. Towards the end the owner of farm rapes the daughter of the family which causes a riot. That is all I can remember now. Help appreciated.

EDIT: Added info. Local cops are in on farm exploitation

EDIT2: Thank you all but the book is not Grapes of Wrath. White family with a black friend, not criminals. Leave their own town (don't remember why) to look for work. Go south (not west). They borrow money from the farm owners  because what they earn is not enough to live on. This is how they become indebted to them and cannot leave until the ever growing debt is paid off. Sometimes they travel to a nearby small town. They managed to inform the sheriff of their situation. They get punished on the farm for informing the sheriff who collaborates with farm owners. The rape leads to riot which might or might not kill the owners. Also not 30's because wondering how such thing could happen in modern times, but I will back away from stating that in 60's. I need that one guy who also read it.

EDIT: Sweetly_retarded solves this riddle. Book is Angel City by Patrick Smith. There is also made for TV movie based on this book.

I don't know if this subreddit is the right place for my question but I'm going to post it anyway.
So, in 2012 we went on a school trip to London. We had a nice time, but when we were waiting for someone, we saw a guy running to this man with a pencil and a piece of paper. He asked him to sign it. 
So we got curious. We didn't recognise the man at all, but we went to him with a piece of paper and asked for his autograph too. We also took a picture.

Does anyone of you know who the man on the picture is? I also took a picture of the autograph. It might be a football player.

I remember seeing this box in the video store when I was younger and always liked the art, but can't remember what the movie was called.

I was in the video store (Videos Etc.) in the late 90's/early 00's. The movie was in the action section. It had a painterly style to it, like 70's and 80's movie poster art, so it was probably from that era.

The image centered around a diver breaking the surface of the water, weapon raised. The angles of everything depicted in the above rendering match my memory pretty closely, though there may be more water splashing and running off the diver. I tried to approximate the colors as best I could remember.

It's *almost* [Thunderball](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t-h01f5ILAk/TmQjdeRoJzI/AAAAAAAAAcY/efgqbCODM_4/s1600/LP+front.jpg), but not quite.

About every 5 minutes my roommate asked me ""are you seeing this?"" and about every 3 seconds I muttered ""what the fuck."" Since that night I've been looking for this film mainly to convince myself that we didn't hallucinate because of a gas leak or something.
So the movie kinda goes like this: Frenchie 1 (maybe middle aged or a bit younger) is visiting his adoptive brother with down syndrome at an assisted living home and the brother is laying on the ground feeling the moles scurry underneath him.
BAM flashback: Frenchie 1 (maybe 10 years old or younger here) is living in a huge house with his mother, father, and older sister, who we will call Frenchette. Frenchie 1's father disappears, and his mother is shopping with the kids at the market. As she reaches the cash register blood starts dripping from her forehead. So now the mother's out the picture, and Frenchie 1 and Frenchette are chilling alone at home, Frenchette takes a bath-
BAM incest: Yup. Incest.
BAM back to the present: Frenchie 1 runs into a woman who looks a lot like his sister and he falls in love with her. She loves him, and he believes she might be his sister.
BAM we're in the future now: Frenchie 1 is old and alone. Really don't remember what happens. Probably nothing important.
BAM flashback: Frenchie 1 and Frenchette are still doing the incest thing, when a friend of Frenchie 1's, Frenchie 2, starts to become jealous and threatens Frenchie 1 with a knife. Then something happens and Frenchie 1 is adopted by a nice family with a child with down syndrome.
BAM future again: We see Frenchie 1 still being alone driving his care, and see a rich older guy I assumed to be Frenchie 2 in a completely new environment, his mansion. Frenchie 2 is gunned down in his bathrobe, and the movie ends with Frenchie 1 driving behind a UHaul-esque moving van that opens up to reveal his sister playing the trombone and a guy singing on piano. He starts laughing and
BAM he turns into a plastic bag blowing in the wind.

It was log-shaped, about 4-5"" long and about the diameter of a nickel or quarter, like a thicker Tootsie Roll. I don't remember anything about the wrapper, but I do remember that the candy itself was in a folded white paper tray just like how the larger Tootsie Rolls are stored in their wrapper. The core was root beer flavored (it has been suggested that it may have been sassafras or sarsaparilla), translucent dark brown, with a texture and consistency like taffy (so if you pulled it apart you'd get those characteristic taffy ""tendrils""). This core was rolled in chopped nuts; it may have been walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts, but definitely wasn't peanuts.

It was definitely a manufactured (not handmade) candy and I used to get it from the local ice cream man and the local pharmacy. This was in central New Jersey.

*Edited for words and details.*

Some of the responses are starting to repeat, so let me further clarify.

* Specific candies that it is NOT include: Tootsie Rolls, pecan nut roll, Cow Tails, Payday, Charleston Chew, candy sticks, fudge

* It is NOT a pecan log roll, though the form factor and general appearance is similar. My mystery candy had a distinct translucent brown root beer core. No pecan roll has that.
* It was NOT bite-sized. This would have been the same size as a standard candy bar.
* It was NOT a hard candy.
* It had no chocolate anywhere on or in it.
* It had no peanuts anywhere on or in it.
* The core was not actually a taffy, it just had the same ""pulling properties"" of taffy. Taffies are opaque due to the hundreds of folds and trapped air bubbles within. The core of this candy was translucent, like jelly in appearance, but would pull apart similar to a taffy. Imagine, say, a Chuckle that you could pull apart and get taffy-like tendrils between the pieces.
* The core was not wrapped around or mixed with anything.
* I am pretty certain that this was not a sugar-free candy as this would have been in the mid 70's and ""sugar free candy"" wasn't really a thing back then.",,False,,t5_2r4oc,1368300377.0,,,True,t3_1e2buz,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1e2buz/an_unusual_candy_i_adored_as_a_child/,

1351056679.0,105,self.tipofmytongue,11zqza,[TOMT][MOVIE] A guy watched an erotic film and sets out to find the erotic actress. He finds her and then a lot of strange things happen after like a russian roulette type of game with a swinging spiked ball over people that will kill one of them.,cupid_2012,123,18,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/11zqza/tomtmovie_a_guy_watched_an_erotic_film_and_sets/,"When I was a kid, I found a movie that my dad had. I watched it and found it strange but interesting. Especially since it had nudity. The first time I saw a nude woman anywhere was in this film. I have been thinking about it for years. Looking for it for years. I will try to tell the story best I can remember. 
It looked like it could have been made in the late 70's, 80's or early 90's. When I watched it, it was the early 90's so it was on VHS There is nudity and sex in this film but no showing of penetration so I don't think its hard core porn. Its like a rated R film or soft porn. 

It starts with a white man(main character) walking into either a bar or movie theater. He hears men yelling “yeah” and clapping. He sees a group of guys sitting watching a movie that's being projected to a screen. (one of those old school projectors) He sits down and watches. (Now I'm going to describe the scene that this man saw) 
       --- a thin white woman with small breast, brown hair and I think hair bangs is sitting on the floor in a bedroom covered with a blanket. A man breaks open the bedroom door. The man has a full beard. The bearded man walks to the woman, picks her up by her arms. She maintains holding on to the blanket to cover herself. She has something colorful on her hair, maybe feathers. The bearded man then grabs the blanket and drops it down. This reveals her naked body. The bearded man then picks her up and throws her onto the bed. Then you see the bearded man on her and a close up of her face. She is smiling and laughing.---

The men of the bar/theater are cheering this whole scene while the main character just stares at the actress quietly. He then realizes he is now by himself watching a blank screen.  He then goes out to search for this woman he saw on the screen. 

He somehow finds her agent, a man,  and then her. I remember the main character was with her and her agent in a bathroom. She was in the bathtub and the agent said something about if he wants to be with her or something he has to have sex with her in the bathtub while the agent watches. The main character agrees. 

 I remember one strange thing that happen sometime later. They end up at some private party where guest play this deadly game. They lay on the ground facing up.. I don't remember how many but more than 6 people. There is a big heavy ball that's maybe black and spiky hanging above them. I don't remember if they were in a row or in a circle. The game starts by the ball being swung. It swings and swings. At some point it will just drop on one or two of them. This was the point of the game. It was like a game of Russian roulette. As it got closer to falling on someone, at least one woman was cheering it on. Eventually it falls on someone and there is blood on everybody. 

That's most of what I can remember. I hope someone else has seen it and knows the title, actors/actress name, image of the vhs cover, maybe a link to the trailer or entire film. Something. I really want to see it again. Thanks   

-----------------------
Solved!!!! I fucking love reddit.  Its “Carnival of fools”  I can't find a trailer or film online to watch it and it might be a while before I can watch it, I'm broke, but at least I know the title!!! This film has been on my mind since I was a kid. I don't remember what age but I was prepubescent when I watched it. I always wondered what  women were hiding under their cloths and after watching this film and seeing the girl go nude, I discovered women are hiding beauty. I watched scenes of the film over and over. Rewind button was used constantly and I would stay up late watching in the living room. My dad didn't care but my mom was bothered by it. The girl and scenes in this film has shaped part of my erotic mind. There are two female looks that I find extremely attractive and one type is the girl in this film. She is probably why I like her type. She was the first nude I saw. I was so into it and my mom so bothered by it, my mother threaten to throw it away. I said she wouldn't really do that. She then took the movie and started walking outside to throw it away to the big dumpster. I walked right by her confident she really wasn't going to do it. Then when we both ended up at the dumpster, she just threw it in the big dumpster. I was shocked and cried. I was too small to climb it so I knew I was never going to see it again. I serious thought that if I ever won the lottery, that I would spend thousands of dollars for ads in two major city publications asking the readers if they know what film this is. That's how much I wanted to find this film. But with reddit and this subreddit I didn't have to spend a dime. Thanks to whoever created this subreddit.

* The male protagonist falls asleep in the subway, it travels out of the city where he is dumped due to a malfunction.

The most I remember about the song is the album cover which is mainly purple. The song's genre is electronic and I'm fairly certain there is some singing in it too. Probably a female vocalist. This is not a lot to work with but any help would be appreciated.
Edit: Probably came out last year or even 2011. 
Edit 2: Okay, my memory is clearing up and I am getting more details. First thing is that the cover has text right in the middle. The font is similar to maybe the Cobra Starship logo. Also I'm pretty sure the album cover is for the single release but I have no way of knowing since it is the only song I have heard from this artist.

There is no mention of the song anywhere. She said it was a female singer, and there is a band called Red Delicous from the 90s with a female singer but no evidence of a song called Soda.

The only lyrics she remembers are ""you make me wet like water"". Still, no song by them with those lyrics that I could find.

A little more digging and I found what I thought was the song. But it was weird. I didn't find the song. I just found a lot of people just like me from five years ago looking for the song.

Basically, the story is as such:  
Humanity has developed faster-than-light travel, and is exploring nearby solar systems. Every now and then they discover the remains of civilizations built by intelligent alien life. As they investigate the ruins, they find that all of these civilizations have, in one way or another, obliterated themselves into extinction. This includes not only using weapons of mass destruction, but things like cannibalism and widespread suicide that seemingly occur suddenly and for no apparent reason.

Eventually, a human ship comes across a space-faring race that hasn't destroyed itself, yet when it attempts to communicate with them, they aliens immediately attack the human ship. I forget how exactly, but eventually the humans find out that the reason they were attacked was because they came from a sector of the galaxy that inexplicably drives all intelligent life within totally insane, and now the other intelligent races of the galaxy are intimidated by this species that has come out of this sector seemingly unscathed.

Human governments and militaries latch onto this opportunity and exploit the other species' fear of us. This includes things like making all of our technology that comes into contact with aliens either by communication or trade look needlessly intimidating, and people that visit alien worlds wear cloaks with hoods or powersuits that obscure their actual physical features.

That's all I've got right now; I've spent an hour or two on Google but can't find anything relating to it.

I'm looking for a very obscure arcade game from the late 90's/early 2000's. The gameplay wasn't anything special but what set it apart was the input method and the shape of the cabinet. I saw it... I think around 2003/2004 in one of those Haven Holiday parks in the UK. It was pretty weird. It spat out tickets, as I recalled.

It was conventionally shaped but it was longer along the bottom ([doodle of layout included](http://i.imgur.com/tWch0fp.png)).

Now. Unusually, the 'joystick' was gun-shaped, as many cabinets where bit it didn't rotate on the X or Y axis. Instead, it slid left and right, forwards and backwards, just like a mouse does (though only so far) and it was also able to rotate on the Z axis. All were limited, with an absolute center, like a joystick but again, no X or Y rotation.

From what I can tell, this is called a ""[Linear Slide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umWgCpT1eIA)"" but so far I've only seen this in output gear, not on a controller. Picture if the joystick were on the head of the slider and you could move it, like a mouse but it was measured like those pistons.

I'm not so much interested in the game itself so much as the proper formal name of the input method -- but the game would help, since I can look up the hardware used to make it once I know its name.

Hey reddit!


I have been searching the whole day because I want to find a youtube channel I visited months ago. Unfortunately did I not save the link and sold my old computer. You might think: ""God, why would u doo that"" and the simple answer is, that I want to watch the videos on it. LOL
THINGS I REMEMBER:


- It was on youtube
- There were 6-15 videos (each about 7-10 minutes)
- Most of the videos (all?) were INTENTIONALLY FAKED documentaries about paranormal or mysterious stuff.
- They were produced between 1970-1990 (you can clearly recognize the retro look and the low camera quality of that time). quality wasnt too bad though.
- The producer might be from France
- The documentaries were made to appear real, to entertain and to scare. it was not like some obvious faked ghost hunter series. It was acutally pretty scary to me, even though i knew it was not real.
There might have been ""X Files"" ""Lost Footage"" ""Lost Files"" in the video name (not the series ""Lost Files"")


CONTENT:


-Video was about a stranded boat that was found, with only a camera in it..the guy in the boat had survived for some weeks, with nearly no food, nothing to drink (i think he fished in 1 of the clips which were shown). he always appeared happy and in the last clip he leaves the boat and swims away, then u only hear some wierd sounds and you can hear that he gets pickd up by a ""light"" (the footage was mostly in brown colors, since the ""original footage"" used in the documentary was from the early 20. century

-there was an FBI coverup and it had to do with aliens, or an alien in a human body, a person was forbidden to leave the house and died while under arrest..i dont exactly know what it was about, sorry.
there was an expedition on a mountain, and there were some wierd natives, that were able to move very fast between the mountains (and scared the expedition by doing that). In the end 1-2 people disappeared, I think there were aliens involved again.

-There was a child, that was able to use telekinesis..there was footage of its childhood, how he moved stuff (like paranormal activity), then later how he was used for experiments. he ended up killing is family and the dog by drowning them in the pool. scary.
-There were more documentaries but i dont remember them.
If any1 provides I link or something that leads to the channel/videos, I will reward the person somehow with a small christmas present.

2) Fat, short devil is sitting on his throne in ice (since Hell has frozen over) and there are two girls in front of him that are naked. He's telling his blond worker/daughter to corrupt the world (or something, I think)

3) Blonde devil-girl gets fucked on couch by two guys wearing sunglasses.

He was having a hard time re-adjusting to ""normal"" life after that, so he went back into the army a year later. Since he was having a difficult time while he was home, I figure it's possible he's remembering the date wrong. That being said-- I think he still probably remembers better than my grandma... so I'd stick with 1971, haha.

He was working at Silver Dollar City in Branson, MO (doing pottery) when they found him &amp; asked him to be on the show. Apparently they found a lot of the show's guests there, though.

Today, I was listening to NPR and eventually, the topic got to this new hit game that was causing some controversy. It was like Minecraft but was based off a USB that you plug into your computer and try to survive for as long as possible. When you die in the game, you're not able to replay the world, so you have to give it to a friend, until the game makes full circle around your friends. The point of the game was to see what it would be like after you die in the game and see how things turn out.

I think I remember the name Generations being mentioned, maybe That's the name. If somebody could tell me where I could find this game, I would love you forever.

Possibly from AskReddit.  

The guy told a story about how he got knocked out and woke up in another life.  He ended up having a wife and a kid or two.  Eventually he noticed something weird in the corner of the room.  He couldn't take his eyes away from it.  I think he said it looked like the fabric of space and time was ripping apart.  His dream wife freaked out and left him.  She took the kids.  Then something happened and he woke up 5 minutes after he was originally knocked out.  Now he is horribly depressed because he misses his dream life.

I've searched all over for it, but I can't find it.  It would be awesome if someone can help me out!

It featured very dark, earthy colors like grey, maroon, and dull greens. The lines were done in pen.  Some of the illustrations I remember were of very large spaces, like a library or a church.  The had a gothic feel to it, but I would like to emphasize the feeling of *space* that these images created.  I'm pretty sure it was a library.  I vaguely recall a librarian figure, but I'm not sure. There were definitely books, however.

It had a very similar feel to primitive first-person RPG games where you explore room-by-room.  One room had a big birdbath type thing like a fountain or baptismal font.  There were plenty of archways.  It gave of such a feeling of loneliness.

Please help!,ammunation,109,29,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/11p6xy/a_song_that_has_been_bothering_me_for_nearly_10/,"First post to Reddit, ya'll, and I am hoping some of you wonderful people can help me identify a song that has been bothering me since the start of my 9th grade year back in 2002. An older friend burnt me a CD welcoming me to high school that had a bunch of songs on it, and the first song on the disc is a song that I have tried my hardest to find through the years. From Googling, asking people in forums, and even getting back in contact with the guy that gave me CD to only tell me ""I can't even begin to remember what song that is."" SO FRUSTRATING. 

I remember some of the lyrics, please excuse me for any errors. For a word/verse I couldn't make out, I just replaced with a question mark.

""allow me to waste a ? of space, 
as i drift to a place of ? and grace, 
new sense of power, 
new sense of taste, 
sobering dream, 
and a noble escape.
as i ? away on the clear golden glass, 
something to canvas, 
(can't remember the rest of the verse).

CHORUS:
i will never be a acquaint,
that world just wasn't meant for me.
i'm ? heading through the seas,
riding the waves of the world.

another second on the surface,
catch one last breath before i dive,
beauty of life through the grain gift of death.""

I am sorry it's so botched, but it's really all I can remember. The song is a mellow rock song, the guy's voice is so smooth, almost like he's talking instead of singing. I am sure it's a song from the early 00's. To be honest, the song kind of reminds me of something from Linkin Park, but it's not them.

If you can get the name of this song for me, you will make me one extremely happy girl. I just have so many good memories listening to this song, without ever knowing who was singing it.

So when I was in 6 grade I watched the fallowing movie on late night
HBO. This would have been around 2001-2002 and the movie couldn't have
been older than the early 90's.
It ran something along the line of a mother and daughter on and Island
(or either they lived close to a shore in the neck of the woods) and
this man (a young man) rides his motorcycle around and falls in love
with the Daughter. The mother is upset with this and tries to ward of
the young man. The daughter ends up running off with the young man and
has sex with him in a motel, where when he looks up during the act he
see's the mother stabbing him (she obviously doesn't its more like a
trick of the eye/him imagining it). The film goes on, and it turns out
that the mother wanted to keep the daughter on the island so that the
daughter would kill the mother (which there mother's mother had her do
the same thing)and carry on the tradition. I believe there is
something along the lines on an abandoned mineshaft where the murder
had happened of the mother's mother--infact there is a creepy little
scene where the mother is pointing a gun at her mother and the mother
runs up and puts the gun in her mouth.
The movie might have contained the words ""beautiful"" ""Heavenly"" or
""Creatures"" in it. I have watched the movies ""Heavenly creatures"" and
""Beautiful Creatures"" and these are not the movies.

The main character sees what radiation does to the cancer, and is able to fine tune the radiation (or convince the friend who works there to do it) so only the type that kills the cancer is used, sparing the patients a lot of time and side effects, etc.

But the inter-dimensional beings figure out what this guy is doing, and give his mom and girlfriend cancer (like Stage IV everything, all at once).  And that's where what I remember ends.

Edit: I didn't think this would get any attention at all, to be honest. I thought maybe someone read the same comment and actually bothered to save it. 

Anyways, I'll go more in depth with this edit. I can't provide very solid information because it was a year ago when I read the comment. I'm very sure the comment was made in /r/nosleep, but I have no idea what thread, I read way too many stories there. I will say that I was very attached to the ""correspondence"" series and might have found it there. Again, not sure.

The first thing you'd notice about the comment is that the comment string it was in had absolutely nothing to do with the content of the story. It was very out of place and very long. When I read it, it had maybe 20 upvotes and only one reply that said ""What did I just read?""

The story begins with the man inviting ""you"" to his house. They're both having a good time, laughing and joking and drinking together. This continues for a bit until s9mething changes. It's hinted that there was something in the drinka. Suddenly the man is emotionless and quiet. He invites her back to his bedroom.

This is the abstract part because it describes very descriptively what the woman is thinking in her haze as she knows what's about to happen and slowly just accepts it. The story ends with her on his bed with his intentions clear, but not yet acted upon.

It begins shortly after the formation of a world government, and the President of Earth is presiding over the trial of Earth's only immortal man, for the crime of withholding the secret of immortality. Much of the book is taken up by his narration of stories of his life, from his birth in prehistoric times to the present. This could almost be the backstory of 'The Man From Earth', but IIRC the main character was never a famous person.

One anecdote I remember is what he called 'Pavlov's Other Experiment', with the supposed discoveries by the scientist after the surprising results of the 1924 Leningrad flood. The novelist added a vitamin deficiency factor that became an important plot point. There was also a story I recall as being very amusing about a British military steamship in Egypt before or during the occupation in the eighteen hundreds.

And finally, as a major plotline (such as it is), everybody is taught the simple trick to become immortal. When dead people are cloned and become 99.99% similar, their soul and memories are reunited with their bodies and they are taught immortality; time-traveling robots collect DNA from everyone who has ever lived and they become immortal as well.

As I said, I've been on the lookout for this book for the last thirty-five years, so if anybody can help, you will have my eternal gratitude.

The scene cuts to her lying face down, dead and with the baby by her side. A horse drawn carriage pulls up to her, as well as the baby's, corpse.

*The baby was wrapped in a blanket. 

*I vaguely associate the movie with either Dracula or the Wolfman.

* I saw this film in either 1989 or 1990.

At this point the women are almost singing in a round, because they are each on a kind of delay from each other. 

The resulting harmonies can only be described as pure and utter bliss.

It was always a wonderful experience for me, except for one time. I remember I found a book that didn't so much scare me as deeply disturb me. I didn't have nightmares about it, but it stayed on my mind for a very long time, and always popped up in my thoughts when I least expected it. IIRC, it was supposed to be a children's picture book. I believe the plot centered around a man trying to grow some manner of fruit/vegetable in his garden, but a mysterious creature frequently appeared and...ate the stuff, I think? Sounds pretty harmless so far. Except for the fact that the creature in question was something like a brown anteater--but with people inside it. I think it was a costume, and the people inside were just messing with the guy trying to grow vegetables, but something about the way it was drawn and the story played out really disturbed me. The only other thing I remember--and I remember this quite vividly--is that the guy growing stuff said ""Alas and alack"" at one point or another. Which, looking back, is a pretty out-of-place statement in a children's book.
 I get the feeling that this book wasn't made to be creepy at all, and that it just somehow burrowed itself into my subconscious and sat there like a rock. Either way, creepy or not, I really want to know what the picture book was called so I can take another look at it.  
I discovered this book in the early '00's at the Allentown Public Library, if that helps. And the book wasn't very old--it was probably published around that time frame, too.

I don't think our family rented it, I think it was on lifetime or something. Here are the following bits and pieces that I remember from the movie:

The main premise: There is a single dad with three kids. The youngest is a girl. The other two are one boy and one girl but I don't remember their ages. The dad falls in love with a girl, who the kids really like. He has her over for dinner one night and he is going to propose to her. Something goes wrong with the ring, and there is some sort of trouble. The dad gets nervous about proposing and goes upstairs for a long time. In the end, the little girl has to step up and propose for the dad.
She says, ""Will you marry us?"" the girlfriend says yes and it is oh so happy.

Here are a few other random details that I THINK are from that same movie.
1. something with a pizza guy coming to deliver something. He comes into the kitchen and there is a problem of some sort.
2. The dad tried to do something clever with the ring. It either got lost in food of some sort, or maybe had something to do with the pizza guy.
3. There might have been a goose in the kitchen.
I have been trying to figure out what movie this is my whole life. As for a year it was on TV, It had to be at least six years ago, if not more.

I remember a post on reddit where some guy said he found out about this game where you sign up and get tasks, usually having to do with filming certain things. He played with his friend for a while but they quit when it started getting too weird. I remember it being Mind-something, but I could be mixing it up with something else. I also remember other people claiming to have heard of it, one guy even said he found out about it through a billboard.

Apparently the group had videos telling you about them and they wore white masks or something similar to that, and after a while the site was closed to the public. It was a cool mystery and I'd like to read about it again.

Edit: I'm gonna try and elaborate a little more. I don't mean faceless white creatures by the mask thing, I remember it having these people in generic plastic white masks. I think there were a few videos with the white masked members but honestly I was a little unsettling so I didn't watch them.

And I'm not completely sure if it was an ARG. Maybe it was, but at the same time it seemed so real. My mind might just be playing it up but I don't remember seeing any of the stuff that usually comes with those sort of games (which admittedly I don't know much about). It was mostly anecdotal evidence from people like the guy I mentioned. He said he signed up for this group and at first it was a fun little thing to do with his friend, but the ""tasks"" required increasingly more personal information so they quit.

I think another guy said he was driving late at night and saw a billboard advertising them, I'm not sure how exactly. Graffiti? An actual ad? I don't know. There were some other people commenting about it on reddit and even a few other sites.

Maybe it was just an ARG, but it's kind of cool thinking that maybe this guy stumbled onto some weird cult.

In order to ensure stability, progress is artifically repressed and kept in state (think something along the line of the Priesthood in WH40k), with 'trusted' individuals having a non understanding role operating technology.

People are ruled over by a technocratic priesthood consisting of individuals who formally questioned the social/technological arrangement, who're inducted and sworn to secrecy for the greater good.

Protagonist is a young man who does so, is eventually inducted. 

Needless to say, pretty dark book, possibly written by one of the bigger names in SF.

He describes himself as pretty handsome and popular among girls, but he has always been too shy to lose his virginity
When he reaches the brothel, the owner welcomes him and suggests to him some unexperienced and younger looking prostitutes, but he sees one who is very developed and he likes her.  Although the owner tries to dissuade him from choosing her, saying that she is unexperienced, he ends up choosing her.
He is waiting in the room when the girl comes in with a tray of food.  After putting it down, she proceeds to bathe him with lotion and also give him a hand job (he describes it as a little painful at first, and he describes his semen a hit white lava, or something along those lines)
After that, they go to bed and when he starts to fuck her, she giggles when he misses and gets too excited, and helps guide him in.  They end up fucking 27 times that night.

I have a bit of an odd request.

My father once told me the story of a band that was pretty popular when he was young. They recorded great material, but rarely (if ever) played live shows. Seeing their popularity grow with each recording (aided by the ""mystery of the band that never played live""), they decided to put on this big show that quickly sold out.

Once the night of the gig came around, they opened to a full venue - completely out of tune and out of practice. With every song they played it only got worse, until they were booed off stage by an angry mob of 'fans' and disappeared never to be heard from again.

Now, I know that this story sounds like just that - a story - but my dad is convinced it happened. Unfortunately, he can't remember the band's name. Here's what he can remember, though:

* They were active some time between the 60s and the 80s (my dad was born in 1953, if that helps).
* They were a rock band or some variation on the genre (I know that this doesn't help much).
* They were either American or English.

I've been searching for them sporadically for the past seven years, but never managed to find something relevant. I hope you guys will have more luck with this than me.

Thanks in advance!

Many many years ago I saw the end of a movie on t.v., and thought it would be awesome to see the whole thing, but never got the name of the flick (this was before the ""info"" button was invented). The only thing I remember is the final scene, where the hero and his sidekick have rescued the damsel and taken her to safety. I think that they are leaving her on a dock to take a ship to safety. Anyway, they leave her there, get in a jeep, and drive back into the fray, with the hero driving and the sidekick (wearing a white suit and hat, which I recall being his ""uniform"") shooting a pair of pistols over top of the jeep's windshield. And there the movie ends.

If anyone has any ideas about what movie this is, I would greatly appreciate knowing. Thank you.

EDIT: I think it was the 80's when I saw this on t.v., so anything which came out later than 1989 would be out of the running.

I know most of you might know what type of movies im talking about, but just to be specific here are a few examples :


- Snatch (2000)
- Vantage point (2006-8)
- Pulp fiction (1994)
- Babel (2005)
- Crash (2004?)
- Memento (2000)

The movie does'nt nessecarily have to show an event through different perspectives (Vantage point), 

but can just have moments where characters 'flow"" in and out of the unique stories that center around a different character (Pulp Fiction)

or like in Memento where a mysterious story is told in un-chronological order several times often in the beginning of a new act or chapter where more details are revealed each time we see the same scene or event hence revealing more about our main protagonist and his (wifes, friends etc.) fate that is often shown in the beginning AND end of the movie.

BTW. A simple name for this type of story-telling technique is enough.

The story ocurrs in a sort of space base where researchers from several races (humanity not present) work to try and decipher several (I think it was five) messages that have been found embedded into the natural laws of phisics of the universe.

The main character is a monkey like girl, that sidesteps and climbs the rigid social structure of the station, and uses clever tricks to get help from other races (including swinging in a bucket near relativistic speeds to be able to parlay with an incredibly slow race), in order to solve the riddle in the messages. Meanwhile this ocurrs there is a power struggle in play in the station, a slow coup in progress created by the station ruler to try and initiate a war.

In the end with the help of a friend the researcher girl has to go into hiding in a compartment in the outer hull of the station to finish decoding the messages, as she understands the correlation between the five messages which before had been worked on separatedly. Finally she decodes the message, and just as the war biding attempt is about to take place, an assembly is called where she reads the decoded message, which defuses the whole situation, and leaves the reader (at least it left me) with a sense of wonder.

I wont say what the message was, in case someone hasn't read it, so I wont spoil the story, it's really good and if someone helps me here I'd suggest if you like sci fi to read it.

Please help! I've google excessively and asked friends and librarians, but without results. 

Book one: 
A recently graduated high school girl, during the summer, drives to the lake for a day with her friends, but never shows up and her car is found abandoned on the side of the road. Thus begins a massive search for her, but she's never found. Her boyfriend, friends, and family are devastated, and her younger sister copes with the loss. I think her boyfriend gets with her best friend, but I can't remember. The book deals with the aftermath of her loss. I think the cover has a picture of a lake/ gorge, and the author is male. 

Book two: 
Slightly comedic, this book is about a dysfunctional rich family with three children. The middle child is middle aged but still lives at home. He is the black sheep of the family, and creeps around at odd hours wearing women's clothes. He turns out gay, and becomes a very accomplished artist. The daughter has her own family, but treats her husband very poorly. She's emotionally unstable, as is her mother. It ends on a happy note, with the daughter reconciling her marriage with her husband, and the mother learns to be happier by eating more chocolate. The book is relatively thin and dark red in color. I think. 

Book three: 
This is a very thick book, and took me a while to get through. It's also about the disappearance of a child, but this time he/ she is very young. The characters involved is the mother, who used to date this man, who is very good looking and sensitive, but still lives at home with his parents and without serious job prospects. He is currently dating a prostitute named Angel or something like that. Angel is incredibly introspective and bright, and the father of the missing child happens to be one of her customers. During the subsequent interrogation, she is bullied into sex with the police officers. The child is returned without incident, and I can't remember the circumstance of his/ her return. But the father is rich but on the cusp of financial collapse, and the prostitute girlfriend finds out she has MS by the end.

I thought I'd let you know that about 90% of the stuff we're seeing caught in the spam trap is either a tumblr link, or a shortened URL.

These comments (or posts) will not show up until a mod approves it - so if you're replying to someone, time is usually of the essence, and it's probably in your interests to not be caught by the spam trap!

The tumblr thing seems to be a recent change to reddit, and there have been a few posts about it on other subreddits with rumours of infected scripts on certain tumblr pages. Either way, every tumblr link is automatically going in the spam trap, and requires mod intervention to verify it's ok, and approve it. It would obviously be better if alternate links could be posted!

Regarding URL shorteners, and ignoring the usual LMGTFY japery, if you're trying to post a link using reddit's usual markdown, containing unusual characters - brackets () for example, you should try putting a backslash \ immediately before each bracket in the link, that will usually work. 

For example:

    [Some wikipedia thing about AC/DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC_\(disambiguation\))

which gives you this:

[Some wikipedia thing about AC/DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC_\(disambiguation\))

* The gradual rise and sudden stop is the most important part. I think the description said that it was so jarring that it made the audience's ears pop.
* The bit about the lack of soundtrack might be partially or completely wrong. I'm pretty sure there was no music at least in this part of the movie, but that doesn't mean we can eliminate any move that has a soundtrack.
* Same goes for this scene being at the beginning of the movie.

Here it is... https://soundcloud.com/matt-vickers-3/gwar-pantera

It's been in my library as a song call 'Pantera' by GWAR ever since I got it off of Limewire freakin' years and years ago. 

I've Googled the song title along with the band, no matching results come up. I've Googled what I think are some of the lyrics (""it's bad it's bad your world keeps trying to get into my head""?), but I get nothing back. They even promote a website at the end of the song, but I can bloody understand what they're saying.

I come to you now, hoping someone can finally identify the song for me. Maybe it's been right all along and it's just no popular enough to show up in any search engine?

I'm not sure how long that Soundcloud link will last, as I obviously didn't create this song... Hopefully long enough.

It's something that's been nagging me for the past 6 or 7 years. Please, TOMT. Help me! You're my last hope. 

Edit: **SOLVED!** You guys are fantastic. The biggest mystery in my life is now solved. Not sure how you did it. Wish I could do more than just say ""thank you"", but it's all I can afford right now.

Thank you.

Everyone in the town takes care of the kid; everyone assumes that he is deaf and mute as he never does speak. I remember them all telling him all of their problems.

In a back room where we usually hung out his family's old PC sat around. It was an old Gateway tower, probably manufactured around 1996 or 1997, and ran Windows 95.

Anyway, when it wasn't in use, it ran this screen saver. It would start with a solid white screen, and would slowly draw different scenes as if they were being drawn by a mouse (they probably were and scripted to be played back as a screen saver). It would probably take about 3-5 minutes for each image to draw, and then it would sit with the image for a while and then start a new one. There were a lot of scenes and I don't know if I ever saw them all. Some that I remember include various still lifes, an island with little palm trees and a volcano, and a man playing a saxophone. They had a sort of paintlike quality to how they were drawn.

Sometimes I'd stay there late and just sleep there, and would end up watching the screen saver for a long time before actually sleeping. It was probably the most relaxing screen saver I've ever watched. Unfortunately, without a name or anything, I am completely unable to locate it. I've tried Google with various keywords describing it, but it's rather impossible: most Google results for screensavers are tainted with malicious sites, and when I find something legit it's a modern screensaver that isn't even what I meant (for example, something that doesn't draw an image at all but just instantly filters an existing one to look painted).

I really want to find this screensaver.  Unfortunately, my friend and I had a falling-out years ago and he has since moved away, so I can't really go and ask about this. And it's very likely the machine has been tossed out since, so I have very little to go on. Anyone have any thoughts?

Her upbringing is an experiment: she is kept ignorant of death or old age (as soon as servants start getting old they are replaced with younger ones, a dead bird found in the garden is explained as ""sleeping"" etc). In consequence she never ages or dies herself. The grandfather figure likes to tinker and invent things, one time he makes her some shoes from resin that look as though they're made from stained glass. One day she wakes up alone in the house, so she leaves and walks into a nearby town and meets a man (the narrator) who unravels her story and tries to help her.

**About the anthology:** I thought if I could at least identify the book itself I'd be closer to finding what the story was. It was a fat, bumper-edition type book, I think it included: 
*""The Fun They Had"" by Isaac Asimov (which crops up all over the place so not much help) 
*A story about automatic weapons-building machines that continue to build and send bombs to obliterate neighbouring countries long after all humans are dead and everthing is rubble
*One about a man and a woman who are the last people on earth. They visit each other but because they are unused to company, they don't get on.
*A character who comes across some frozen animals in a forest. He works out that although they don't move, they are being kept alive (their eyes move) as part of some kind of sinister museum collection (think there is some floating orb that collects and paralyses them?) and has to escape before becoming part of it himself.

This sounds like an easy question, but I've been googling and binging for this thing for years..literally.  It plagues me.  So here's what I remember:

The most important clue is that the song was featured in a Virgin Megastore promo cd that I got for free in New York City sometime between 2004 and 2006 (I was in high school).

There are 2 tracks that I'm 100% sure were featured on that very cd.  One was the now very well known ""Don't know why"" by Norah Jones, and the other, ""The End of Nothing"" by Funeral for a Friend.

Funeral for a Friends album, Hours (the album that was being advertised) was released in 2005, so it's possible that this promo cd could have been handed out between '04 and '05.  But since Norah Jones' album released in 2002 and was added to the promo cd 2 years later, since I was still in high school I'd put the range between '04 and '06.

Either the band name, or the song of that band, had the word ""Inc."" in it, preceded by another word.  I do not believe the band is Hate .Inc because I've spent a lot of time on YouTube listening to their songs and it doesn't match the obscure tune that's in my head.

It's not Garage Inc.  everyone knows Metallica.

This song did have kind of a dark sounding yet heavy alternative metal theme (imagine ""So Cold"" by Breaking Benjamin, or the verses in ""Holy Mountains"" by System of a Down).  The verses were a bit slow with some melodic electric guitar and softer drum beats and working up to the chorus got louder riffs (but not hardcore sounding) and I thought for the longest that the last line of the chorus sounded like ...""it's the on-ly thing..that will set you free..""  But after extensive searching, no dice.

I've searched endlessly for ""Virgin Megastore promo CDs"" and any sort of search that would link Norah Jones and Funeral for a Friend to Virgin Megastore and have found nothing.  If there was a database of all of Virgins promo CDs, I'd search there, but alas I have not found one.  I tried amazon and Paypal just to see if someone happened to be selling one with a track listing..nothing.

I'm hoping a Redditor out there may have better resources than I do.  I'm sorry I don't have a humming tape or anything.  To be fair, I've tried it on this one site and just got links to weird Japanese songs.

If I think of anything else, I'll edit accordingly.

Here's a link to ""So Cold"" by breaking Benjamin for a general idea of the overal feel of the song http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rTiGlNDnOtE

And here's a link to ""Holy Mountains"" by SOAD...the sound of the verse feels very familiar to the song I want 
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-bNqBjKrQI

Hope I did this right.  I hope there's enough info.  I'm newish to reddit so let me know if there's some weird Internet winner award or whatever for whoever helps.  Thank you.

EDIT: I'm starting to think that I was wrong about Funeral for a Friend being in the same CD.  I've received some interesting links to discographies and can't find any that has Norah Jones and FfaF together, so I may not be on the right track.  I am confident that it was a CD with one or the other though, so I'll continue searching for compilation CDs with Norah OR Funeral, rather than AND.

EDIT:  Solved!  lanegan has found it!  The song is Freakhouse - Liars Inc.  I am so damn happy it's stupid.  I don't know how or where I heard this song before, but I'm happy to have found it again.

**General plot:** 
  
Scientists had developed a drug that can extend a person's life indefinitey, or to around ~200 years (I can't remember) and as because of this, nature seems to have made births very rare to offset the low death rate.  
There's good money to be made in letting couples spend an hour or two with your child if you're lucky enough to have one, to get the experience that they can't have and whatnot. Because of this, there's an illegal drug called the ""Peter Pan Drug"" which will keep them physically a child indefinitely - however it's highly illegal.   
  Also, kidnapping a child is seen as one of the most atrocious crimes one can commit, and a life-long jail sentence is the standard punishment. Which in this case, can be a looooooong time.  
  
The story follows one child learning how stagnant society has become when everyone lives forever, and meeting Peter Pan-children, and how he never wants to end up like that.

You play an aspiring painter who is tasked with reproducing some of the world's most famous paintings for clients who are on a budget.

You have about eight really awful colors to work with and a few different brushes. When you finish a painting, you will be paid according to how well you reproduce the work.

Eventually, you have the option to sell original pieces to galleries who each have curators with various tastes in art you have to cater to.

I remember the person that wrote the game worked on an indie game that was pretty popular, but I don't remember which one. Help me out and I'll try to put together a short gameplay video of this very offbeat title.

Pretty hot girl and her step-brother (or something like that) are living together in some European country.  She's a model, and I dunno what he did but I guess he decided to try smuggling a designer drug over the border for extra cash and got caught.  He's now in jail (maybe he was a cook, cause I remember him cooking stuff in the jail), and one of her model friends tells her about this super secret escort service that she might be able to join.  Turns out the state dept guy who's helping the pretty hot girl (PGH from now on) with her brother/boyfriend/lover is also investigating some murders where pretty girls are being killed in some kinda weird fetish lingerie that inflates (yes, inflates... like a bike inner-tube).

Sooo, PHG gets to start training to be in this secret circle.  Nice apartment, fancy clothes, massages, the usual ""pampered"" story line.  Oh lookie here in the underwear drawer, there's one of those kinky lingerie things that inflate.  Lots of weird stuff ensues, people are getting drugged by PHG with the designer drug via something they put in her tooth (of all things).  State dept. guy starts hallucinating about nuns.  Cheesy stuff.

Then it gets really weird.  Part of the process for getting into this super secret call girl ring is that she has to have all the hair removed from her body... including that special lady place down there.  So they make her soak her lady flower region in ""a green liquid"" and THEN PROCEED TO HAVE CRICKETS EAT ALL OF THE HAIR OFF.

Yes, this was a movie that was played on HBO.  

I think there was a famous guy in there somewhere... not famous, but recognizable (like I've seen him in another movie) and he was the owner of the call girl ring.  So he gets killed, she gets her brother out, and then dumps him for the blind masseuse.  And she's going to buy him new eyes or something with all the money she suddenly got.

While she is throwing it in the pile, she tells him to get the girl out of the car. Throughout the video she is constantly berating him, calling him a coward and such. He goes to get the little girl out of the car (she is covered with a tarp) when she starts moving. He gets a horrified look on his face and calls his wife over.

I don't remember much, but here it goes. This will be very vague but I'll try my best. 

1.The story had something to do with magic, not like wizard magic but subtle magic. 

2. There was a brother, and in at least part of the story he was an adult. 

3. At some point he was locked in a closet, or hid in a closet himself. He might have been kept away for a long time.

 - The main protagonist is male, starts out doing rounds in an ambulance? driving people somewhere. I'm not sure at all about this part. I might be making this up;

 - At some point, he ends up in a room full of lists, having to choose random numbers, even after he figures out that each number is a person and that that person will be killed;

I found it in a thread from 4chan, and this recent influx of interest on the Deep Web made me remember it. 

I also recall someone linking to a certain part and somewhere saying that an old hermit lives there that can help you, etc. It was all very mysterious, and judging by the website map someone posted, very, *very* large. Anyone know what I'm talking about? Or what exactly it even is?

I'm not even sure what the website was supposed to be about, whether it was just a game for people to learn hacking, or a database of hard to get info, but whatever it was, it's supposed to be locked up securely for only but the best of hackers. Also, the place was pretty creepy, to me at least, because it had strange, nonsensical stuff writen on some pages, making it look like bizarre puzzle.

Also, it was not Hackthissite or anything TOR related, because I was able to normally access the pages with my ordinary browser. It might have something TOR related behind it, but it was not readily apparent.

So basically...

* It has been played along side many montages about drugs/trips/culture in the 60s/70s. I believe it was aired with a Fox cartoon (ie, Family Guy, Simpsons, American Dad) on an episode, but I can't seem to track it down.
* It has a stringed instrument strumming, I believe, not sure if guitar or sitar. It has very memorable chords in that they sound pretty out there, far away from traditional majors and minors.
* I don't recall it being particularly ""rock"" with riffs or loud drums. Though the song doesn't sound too soft or quiet.
* It had a male singer. I think he sang right to the beat of the chords.

I'm sorry that I can't remember much more, and that most of it is a half memory. I've been trying to figure it out for weeks, and can't do it. I'd love you guys forever if you helped.

**Edit!:** So, lyrically, all I can seem to remember is something about ""people"" (big help, right?). I'm remembering the song sounding a lot ""crisper"" than the grainy songs from the ""age"". It's possible it's a neopsychadelic song, recorded past the 60s. It has a strong strumming to it, which I can't emphasize enough, as none of the songs posted really had the weight of the chords in the song. That's all I got for now. Sorry :(. I'm at the point where I'm doubting if this is even real.

So the first one. A Comedy Central Presents. The comedian was a average height white guy. He had a series of jokes about getting his first computer and looking up weird things online. The joke started with looking up dinosaurs, then looking at girls, then girls in panties, then girls naked then dinosaurs in panties. 

Second. Another Comedy Central Presents. Tall white guy, leather jacket. His set had a chest high roman pillar he leaned on. He was kind of a whiney sounding and complained about going to the dentist and the dentist's light aggravating his astigmatism. I also think he had a joke about living on a street called ""Tarzan"" or something.

Third. Short white guy. COmedy Central Presents. I think his set was an old fashioned baseball scoreboard. I THINK. He had a joke about him and his friend getting a hooker that turned out to be a dude, and him grabbing the roll cage on his jeep and kicking him/she out of the jeep after she tried to steal their wallets.

Last was the one off comedy special. The set looked like a modern set but it was outdoors. The comedian was a tall muscular white guy who I believe was Canadian. He had a joke about smashing his penis in the hotel toilet seat (o_0).

I know that was a lot but these keep me up at night. I saw these all long ago when I was staying up late when I should have been sleeping and being a good student.

3. The vocalist is female and sounds young (20s-30s). I didn't notice an accent so she's likely American. Her range is average to high. Despite the tempo, she sings it in a way that is fairly withdrawn/emotionally unattached. The vocals are sung in a mostly staccato pattern.
4. These are the only snippets of lyrics/melody I can remember, and I'm not even sure how accurate they are, I may have mixed which lines go with which:

""When I lie awake,
D-D-D-A-C----
""you could always care less, you could always care less""
F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---

And then a similar verse that I can only remember the first part of:

""When we are apart,
D-D-D-A-C----
""da da da-da da daaa, da da da-da da daaa""
F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---F#-F#-F#-G-E-D---

Here's me whistling the melody of this part of the song:

They come upon a door and when they open it they find a scary poorly lit room. One guy enters inside and lights start to go out and some loud mechanical sound can be heard, like some machinery is starting up.

I am trying to remember the title of this movie i saw about 5 years ago. My best guess would be that it was made from 1990 or sooner because of the picture/production quality. It was a short movie, maybe 30 minutes tops and the synopsis was something like this...

Widower lives as a lighthouse keeper and is looking back on his life as he nears death. He has several flashbacks to moments that changed him. One flashback is of a couple laughing and holding each other on the beach. He remember this vividly because he was struck by how carefree and in love two people could be. Another flash is from when he was a young newlywed and he was in a grocery store with his wife and newborn child. They go through line and he can't afford the food. A gentleman steps up and pays for their stuff. This sticks out to him because he learned the true meaning of generosity. There are a couple other flashback I think, but I can't remember.

Anyways, upon his death, letters are sent out (from his lawyer maybe?) to the people that changed his life. The carefree couple each get a letter but have since divorced and the daughter of the guy who paid for his groceries gets a letter. They all meet at the lawyer's office and happy endings all around with tearful epiphanies of what is important in life and whatnot.

Wish I could remember more! I have Googled this to the best of my abilities with no luck. We were shown this movie in a management training class I was taking for work.

Link to older thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/c59vj/tomti_cant_remember_the_name_of_this_moviemovie/

Let me explain to you what I know:

The first thing that happens is one man (Caucasian) getting robbed by a few men in a car. The thing that's got robbed is a suitcase he needed very bad. He calls his friend to pick him up. His friend shows up (also Caucasian) and he starts whining about the car his friend stole (it's quite a bad car). They both wear suits (?).

They get a call from the robbers about how to get it back. They start swearing and trace the call back to visit the robbers to try to get the suitcase back. Two other men join them in their quest to get the suitcase back (1 Caucasian and 1 fat African-American). Two of them go around the back with a slight detour (a few stairs and all). The African American man isn't really fit at all and starts breathing heavier (one of the parts I can remember very good). They don't have a hard time getting the suitcase back (4? robbers died in the gunfight).

They got the suitcase back and they go to some jewel store to steal something (?) don't know what the suitcase was needed for.

A few scenes I don't know where they happened in the timeline given above:

One scene is about the two first men going to meet an ex-girlfriend of one of them and he has sex with her. The other man is buying cigarettes and after he is done the other guy is done and they continue their mission.

One scene is in a dry-cleaner store where they (2 men) interrogate one man and shoot him. Also two customers who (unlucky) walked in to get their drycleaning get shot too.

One scene is in a alley where they (2 men) chase a man in a vivid colored training suit (red or blue?) and they manage to get to him and get the information they want. They let him walk away (?)

It is possibly an American movie and it all takes place in one city (don't know which city). It all takes place in a suburb like place. It was good weather (no rain).

One thing that stands out in this movie that the ASL (average shot length) is very high. It almost looks like the movie is filmed with one camera and in one take.

The movie was probably from between 1998 till 2007.

Hope you guys can help me out. Really want to watch this movie again :D

IIRC there is also a bit about some kind of letter box and some location he found on this peninsula and something about a hatchet it all started from some scrapbook-like diary/journal that had weird time travel shit in it.

It all culminates into an absolutely amazing stage show involving time travel and saving the world, all centered around this guy who is solving the puzzles. They lead the 'pranked' onto the stage and have the actors act out a play around him, they even scripted parts for the play in case the 'victim' didn't know what to do.

I've tried searching a bunch of terms like puzzle, mystery, time travel, diary, stage show, in all sorts of combinations but obviously that is too general to get anything. I'm sure someone out there knows what I'm talking about.

Ok, so this is maybe a long shot, or maybe not.

I won't go into the details but essentially they played mostly black and white movies and gave away money during breaks, from time to time.

On Dialing for Dollars they'd play a promo thing when it started up (kinda some quick shot from lots of movies) and during the promo thing they'd show (for like half a second) what looked like hundreds of medieval type guys and horsemen flooding out of what looked like a meteor, or maybe a big fire (again this was black and white and like a half second shot). The picture was specifically of a round fire/ meteor thing in the middle of the screen and guys pouring out of it, at speed, from all sides.  I imagined this to be some sort of time portal or maybe the thing was supposed to be manufacturing the guys coming out of it, but its hard to say with a 1/2 second clip.  This would've been a shot from a movie they played but obviously I never saw it.

  Merlin ends up falling for a blonde haired mute girl who Uther forces to give him oral sex. After she bites him and is found violated, Merlin hides her in the woods suspecting Uther but not wanting to believe he would do such a thing.

Eventually the girl's brother is found and he speaks to her with sign language and we find out that she used to have red hair and violet eyes which were a sign of good luck but something happened to her and her hair and eyes changed colour leading people to think she was cursed or something?

At the end of the book, Arthur is born  and Merlin takes him away to raise him and also finds a chest of poisons, tricks and gunpowder from a man to the Far East. This we are led to believe is how Merlin's magical legend grew (from the use of these objects)

There is at least one more book and I would love to buy it and the first one, but I can't remember the title. Please help!

First thing he encounters is a grey maze where there are a few people all eating grey fruit and they have turned grey.

It's set in the 80's or 90's. There are two protagonists, a man and a woman, and I think they get romantically involved during the movie. They live in a normal world, but suddenly weird stuff starts happening that foreshadows the coming of the apocalypse. They go together on a search for answers and for a way to stop it. I think they are looking for a diamond, but I'm not sure. They are most definitely looking for something, though. The movie ends with them realizing that their search was in vain and that there is no hope. They are clutching each other and despairing. I think they are about to drown in the last scene, but I'm not certain.

It's a very surreal movie. It's unclear how the apocalypse will happen or how to stop it, but all the while it seems like there are answers to be found, but they are beyond the grasp of mere humans.

It left a strong impression on my young mind and I would like to see it again. Anyone has an idea what it is?


EDIT:
It's Miracle Mile!

They weren't looking for a diamond, but a helicopter pilot. I have no idea how I confused the two. Please excuse some other mistakes I made, I watched it back in 1995.

I have a feeling it was foreign, because I remember watching it with English subtitles. I'm guessing it was French, but it's just a guess.

If memory serves me, it's about a man that feigns suicide (I think he plunges a knife into his back) to see how the other people in his house will react (I don't recall if they all lived there, if he was having a party, or what). There are maybe five to eight other people in the house, one of which I believe is his daughter. I think the movie takes place in a fairly large house; maybe a mansion.

I think one of the characters sings (what about I'm not sure); if I recall, it was a particularly frou-frou woman.

In the end, the man reveals that he faked suicide to see how the other people would react. However, he does end up actually committing suicide, I think because he was shocked/disgusted by how the people did react.

It was a black&amp;white thriller/film noir, with a 40s or early 50s feel. Somehow, I seem to remember the movie is set in London --- but I could be completely wrong about this. I could also be completely wrong about the black &amp; white --- maybe it was a color movie that I just happened to see on a black &amp; white TV. 

The movie features a fancily dressed killer who is never fully shown; his face is always off-camera, or hidden by shades; typically, only his leather gloves, or his shoes are shown.

There are three scenes I distinctly remember. The first one is set in an office building. The killer first removes the 'out of order' sign from an elevator. Then, his unsuspecting victim steps in the elevator, and promptly falls through the elevator floor. He manages to latch onto a steel girder, but then the killer enters the elevator shaft, lights up a cigarette, and proceeds to burn one of the hands of the victim, who is forced to let go of the girder. The killer then puts one of his feet on the other hand of the victim, and pushes down hard, causing the victim to plummet down the shaft.

Another scene has the killer driving a white lorry. His second victim (who is either one of his henchmen or a corrupt cop) gets in the back of the lorry to talk to the killer. They have a conversation via a small grill between the drivers cabin and the back of the lorry. Again, the killer is not shown. They get into an argument, ending with the killer sticking a gun through the grill and emptying it straight into the victims' face.

The finale scene finally shows the killer in full. It is set in some basement, or sewer system, where the heroine of the story is tied up a the bottom of a wide round pool or basin, that is quickly filling up with water. Of course the hero is just in time to save the day.

The movie was about a boy (~16-20 years old), who lives in a mental hospital. He' mentally disordered because of his disturbed relationship to his mother. He can pretty much leave the hospital whenever he wants to (or maybe he sneaks out) and he eventually meets the daughter of his therapist, and starts somewhat of a relationship with her, without her knowing about his illness. When the therapist finds out about it, he of course tries to stop the boy from meeting his daughter.

There are two scenes in particular I remember:  
In the first he is at an outdoor party (maybe with the therapist's daughter, I don't remember her being there or not) and gets flirted with by some girl. He considers her to be slutty and compares her to his mother (who he considers to be slutty as well). The movie then either heavily implies him killing her or actually shows it.  
In the second scene he and the therapist's daughter visit her old house, which is now vacant. She then tells him about her dead mother (and he starts to pity her somewhat?).

I already tried to find the movie via google, but to no avail. Thanks for all help.

There's a lot more to this book but to elaborate on what I remember (I will if I have to) would spoil the fun.

Edit: And as long as we are on the topic; I'm look for an anthology of science fiction stores about cars. Like sentient cars and in another story, a days long traffic jam. A third, a parking garage with hundreds-plus levels and no free spots. I thought Martin Greenberg edited but no go. Help?

I read a lot of scifi books at the time (scifi lit class) so i may be mixing stories but i distinctly remember the main character and maybe part of his expedition making it to the top only to find a rusted out space ship (possibly US but defiantly from earth) and some dead astronauts.

Pretty great book but i can't find anything from google and the prof doesn't even remember the book.

This was around 97/98 so it's at least that old.

I think the alien rave was a sort of hermaphrodite (but i was reading left hand of darkness at the same time and could be confused. I thingy it was the same book until i reread it again) and the main character had a limp and that was a big part of the first part of the story.

A bit more details, as requested:

- It was not an animated movie
- The main character was a white male, I'd say in his 20s-30s.
- Part of the credits scene are happening in his apartment.
- Tidbits I remember: at the beginning, the character sees the credits rolling down the screen, and plays with them with his hand, trying to touch them- although he's a bit wary, etc. At one point he puts objects on the credits and they get carried away until they fall down when they reach the top. There's a part where he struggles to fall asleep because the credits are rolling; he finally falls asleep, and when he wakes up they're still there, which drives him mad.
- He starts throwing stuff at the credits, and while the lines he hits fall down, there's still more coming down.

All i know is that the movie is probably from Europe (sounded Italian, Spanish or Portuguese or something)
The main protagonist is a young man who seems to find himself in a series of strange situations.

Its not an old movie itself, but set some time in the late 70s, 80s or early 90s (the cars didn't look that old)

I remember it was shown at in or around the same time as Rashomon (1950) on RTE 2 a few years ago if that helps.

Some notable scenes i remember:

* 2 men play a game of Frisbee with circular saw outdoors, and end up inadvertently killing an (annoying?) husband when the main character disrupts their game... the main character is then implicated in the man's death and is interviewed by police.

* The main character is in a phone booth, and calls a captain of a ship, he fires a pistol into the receiver end of the phone, and the guy on the other end of the line gets shot.. 

* A car stops suddenly on a road, and the car behind it does not crash into it, it ""overlaps"" / merges into the car in front - a woman in the car is distressed, while the male driver casually exclaims ""relax, i've got virtual drive"" or something similar ""virtual drive"" was definitely in the subtitles.

* A flashback of the main character's mother's untimely death features her dancing in a quarry or building site, then being hit with a bulldozer or digger. (a narrator explains the details).

* The main character's fat girlfriend, dramatically thins through sheer willpower when the two find themselves being chased and need to squeeze through a narrow gap..

I've seen this movie 6 years ago on TV, forgot the tile, and have been trying to track it down ever since.

Even with those very specific scenes i haven't been able to track down the movie.

As we came across the topic of techno music, he started to remember things he did in his younger ages. 

Apparently, in the 80's or 90's, he composed a techno/electronic piece while he was living in Latvia. Many electro pieces, to be exact. He describes most of them having an organ play in the background, but that may not help. There was one piece, however, that he remembered the most. After creating the piece, he sold it to - using his words - ""a famous group from the UK."" 

The ""famous band"" released his track on one of their albums. My uncle told me that it got pretty famous around the UK, and he even heard it playing in America once. He tells me that if it was 2001 right now, he'd be able to tell the exact name of the song. But, after a severe car accident in 2006, he had forgotten most of the details of the track. 

But I won't leave you hanging there. He remembers one thing. 

Apparently, there was a music video along with the track. He remembers that he had to write a story to go along with the track, which would later become the plot of the music video. Through his words, the music video was a lot like this:

""In a mountainous area, there was a man who once lived in a village that always flooded. During a large flodding the man would swim on top of the water with a very long pipe to feel around for his house. 

And when he found the house, he would swim down and go inside the house, regardless of the fact that he was underwater. He would sit on a chair inside his over-flooded house, and just sit there and think - using his pipe as a breathing tube that he would stick out of the water."" 

He described how the man's favorite spot in the world was the flooded house, where he can just think. 

I know this is a HUGELY ambitious thing to ask for, especially because I don't have very many details. But if you remember something like that, tell me. It would serve my uncle very greatly.

Years ago, my family and I were all watching tv in October. While surfing through the channels my Dad stopped on a channel that had a seemingly creepy movie playing.

It featured a middle aged man running around a house during a storm, with the usual scary music and lighting. Meanwhile, the movie keeps cutting to his dead mother, who is upstairs and in bed. I don't know what the premise of the story was, why she was there, etc. But I do know that her corpse was scary as hell. (Obviously a dummy, didn't resemble a realistic body at all, but terrifying nonetheless.) 

Later, the body starts to wake up. It sits up in bed in a very unnatural motion. Then starts shambling across the house looking for the frantic man (who I can only assume is the son). The whole scene is corny and cheap but oddly frightening, at least in my memory. The rest of the movie sucked but that particular scene was really creepy and had a tremendous impact on me and the rest of my family.

I'm trying to recall the name of a movie I saw when I was young. I remember watching it on TV. I don't know if it was a crappy film on the SciFi or if it was a blockbuster. Anyway, let me describe the details I do remember:

It was set in the future, I think in a small town. Some sort of event happened, maybe a nuclear war, and the future was really bleak. People were deformed, and if I recall correctly, people even had robotic implants. Because everyone was depressed with their lives, it was decided that everyone would get implants in their heads and a signal would be broadcast that made them perceive their lives were great. They wouldn't see the crummy house they lived in. Instead they'd see a beautiful house. They wouldn't see their own deformities, they would see healthy bodies. This went on for generations, and the babies received implants at birth. Eventually the people forgot what their real lives were like. 

That's the setting. Then we meet the main character, who is just an ordinary guy who thinks his life is great. One day, though, he has an accident and head trauma and his implant becomes damaged. He sees flashes of the real world, but he thinks he's just losing his mind. Eventually though, he figures out that what he is seeing is real and the life he is used to living is fake. 

I think he meets a handful of others who have figured it out as well and in the end they decide it's time to shut down the broadcast. I vaguely remember the broadcast was being sent out in a nearby nuclear power plant, but I'm not sure. 

From the look of what I'm remember in my head, I would say the movie came out in the 1980s. 

If any of you might have seen it and can tell me what it was called that would be great! I've been trying to find it for a few days now without any luck.

2) Ragnarok. That's really it. The Norse Gods were playing a game, I think, and called Loki a cheater. The comic ended with the two human characters on the tree of life.

Here's what I can remember:

A man, possibly visiting India, discovers that he has the ability to see through things. He develops his power by playing cards, using it to his obvious advantage to acquire currency.
As he reaches the peak of his power, he looks in a mirror, and to his horror, sees a blood clot. The author goes into great detail about how the man then spend a significant amount of time watching, as the blood clot slowly moves through his body, and ultimately to his heart, killing him.

I've asked librarians, literary societies, professors, and googled like a mad man, but no luck. The most common answer I get is that it was probably by Poe, but despite similarities between this story and The Tell Tale Heart, I have not found it yet.

I'm offering a reward this time to see if that will help, this has been bugging me for ages and I just want the book already. The reward will be an amazon gift card, unless you prefer something else.

I remember reading a book when I was younger, at least ten years ago, about a haunted house (possibly on a hill). If it helps I live in Winnipeg, MB, Canada, it was most likely read in elementary in grades 4+. I am 25 now, so it was somewhere in that range, I'm fairly certain it was before high school, so somewhere that range, though it could of course be older.

There were a series of short stories about it starting with three inmates who were killed building the house for the warden of a prison (or just building a house). They were chained in the basement, there was a flood in the basement (due to heavy rain I believe), and they died. The house became haunted, and grew more powerful as it took more and more ghosts in. Eventually the people came to destroy the house, and set it on fire, however when they went back to their town they found their town on fire. They turned back to the house and it was fine. 

Various people came to live in the house over a hundred years or so, starting with the warden's family. I remember the warden's child being taken by the ghosts of the inmates, I can't remember if the warden and his wife left or were taken. Eventually the house was abandoned after various people had gone missing in it and kids would come to play and disappear.

I also remember one of the short stories involved a fountain, something was in the fountain that (ghost fish or something) that almost got a boy, around the beginning of the century. He was an old man when the townspeople went to burn down the village and shared his story about the evil of the house. A lot of people had shared their stories in the last story (after someone went missing I believe), but they waited too long and the house had taken too many so it was too strong.

This guy's family is in dire financial straits. His elderly father suffers from dementia and needs constant care. The guy (let's call him Charles) is running around trying to prevent a bankruptcy or something. Meanwhile, he has to also take care of his father, who keeps mumbling ""mcdonalds"". This makes Charles think that his Dad is always hungry, so he keeps taking him to McDonalds which is very inconvenient for Charles, but hell, the old guy is about to die, so might as well give him what he wants.

Eventually we find out the old guy isn't as demented as previously thought. When Charles and the rest of the family shuts up for one second and actually listens to the old man, they realize he wants to visit the old family farm (or some such place). Once there, the old man removes a couple bricks to reveal a secret hiding place. In it, they find a shoebox containing a bunch of McDonnel-Douglas stock certificates.

1) Some guy gave one of the protagonists a heart attack by just commanding that it happen. IIRC it was a homeless man. He gets up from his bench and randomly says to the other guy ""{something something} oh look you're in cardiac arrest."" 

2) SWAT type people are going through an apartment building shooting everyone. I think they were looking for the protagonist. They open a door and this woman is riding this guy. I vaguely remember one of them stopping time and then shooting the guy [and maybe the woman as well.)

The book is 'The Far Kingdoms' by Allan Cole and Chris Bunch.  Thanks very much to you all!**

It was quite a few years ago that I read it.  The genre was pretty much medieval fantasy, though it wasn’t all that ‘fantastic,’ if you will.  This is absolutely everything I can remember about the plot:

The story starts with the young-ish main character falling in love with some kind of prostitute.  He tries (I can’t remember if he succeeds) to trick her into loving him back via some form of love potion or spell, but he gets caught by her employer (or whoever) and gets in a lot of trouble.  

Later, he joins some kind of expedition (which I believe was affiliated with the military in some way?) and becomes friends with its leader, who is the other main character.  I want to say that this new guy’s name starts with an H.

So they all go on a journey together, and I’m not really sure how all that goes, but eventually they get to where they’re going.  At the end of the book, the main character and the expedition leader dude have a fight, I don’t remember over what.  The main character wins, and stabs the other guy through the chest.  I distinctly remember the guy who got stabbed saying ‘when you take this sword out my soul comes with it,’ or something like that.

Other random details I remember:

At one point, the main character gets married and has a daughter, but I believe both the wife and child die.

At another point, the main character is tortured.  The man who tortures him only has one eye, and there’s something weird about his empty socket.  It either has a worm in there, or some kind of ‘glimmer,’ or… something.  The author talks about the almost intimate relationship that develops between the torturer and the tortured.

The expedition leader has an orgy in his tent.     

Something about a ferret?

The main character has a fight with some evil prince, and the book makes a big deal about how the prince holds his knife in just the right way so that it’s impossible to disarm him.  

Anddddd that’s about it.  I know I’m throwing a lot of random stuff out there, but I figured too much information was better than too little. 

I would be SO excited if I could re-read this book.  If anyone knows which one I’m talking about, I would be super grateful.  

Thanks!

1295297274.0,43,self.tipofmytongue,f401r,[TOMT] Guy with a forum with hundreds (maybe thousands) of posts/replies - he is only user. ,Panda413,44,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/f401r/tomt_guy_with_a_forum_with_hundreds_maybe/,"I read this about 3-4 years ago. There is a guy that created a forum to discuss wrestling and (maybe) anime if I recall. He is the only registered user, does not take new users. He has created several sections and posted regularly in each, often responding several times and carrying on debates about various stuff. 

Once the internet caught on, they did some searching and found a lengthy history of his original interaction with people on various forums that led to him creating his own forum. People even found pics of the guy.

I can't remember much else... any help would be appreciated.
